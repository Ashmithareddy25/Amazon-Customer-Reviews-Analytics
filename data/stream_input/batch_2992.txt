B0010YSD7M|5.0|Closure to a decade of fun and exciting adventures by the Stargate team.  I would not have missed it for the world.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|I love HIMYM!  This season was a great one and was so excited for the new season to start. So many great episodes and the ensemble cast is so funny; they work very well together and have great chemistry.
B0017MO10U|5.0|The DVD helped in the process of bringing closure to one of my all time favorite TV series.  The Characters throughout the series became part of my family as time progressed.  Quirky humor and sly references to reality kept the sci-fi fun.
B000UMXCTY|5.0|All the CD's in this collection stand on their own.the songs and added demo's are a real treat to revisit.Listening once again to Silent Night which so influenced John Lennon on the close to I am the Walrus is brilliant still.The harmonies are still there and still delighful just a Phil and Don and John and Paul, Art and Paul are for the ages.One of my new favorites is the 1970's demo of Bardriellen a song I first heard only a part in the 1951 english verison of Dickens A Christmas Carol.Paul Simon, like Lennon and McCartney help to write some of the most beautiful and memorial songs of the 60's defining the times and shaping our memories of those times.Scarborogh Fair is one the first albums I can remember hearing.What isn't to love.A poem on the underground Wall,For Emily ,where Art voice soars.Underlying all is Paul guitar.Of all the songs included is of course Bridge over Troubled Water.That at first hearing at ten was a little to deep for me.But with age comes wisdom one hopes.And Like the Beatles The long and winding Road,stands as final cresendo to not only a brilliant carreer but to the 60's which they help to define.But I judge everyone by what I heard Paul Simon say long ago.An artist is someone who when you  look at the begining ,middle and end of their carreer's is like looking at three different people.Which is why Simon is great he did not let only this part of his work define him and leave him like so many .When all we can say about them is remember when.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Was not all that pleased with this Bingo game.  I do not play on-line so thought the comments posted meant little.  This game was a bit much for me, but am sure that it would  appeal to a more hard core player.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I, too, have often wondered whatever happened to Danny Torrance as he grew older.  Now I'm wondering about Abra.  You won't be disappointed with Doctor Sleep.  For all you hard-core King fans, it is everything you would expect, but much, much more.  Enjoy.
B00499NHLC|4.0|The mind of Sherlock is fascinating.  The chemistry between the actors is fun to watch.  The fast pace adds to the plot and the humor is one of dry wit and well placed sarcasm...
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|It took forever for me to get into this book, like halfway through the book, but it's a pretty good story with a lot of interesting characters, and has kept my appetite for fantasy at bay while still waiting for the next Godsland series book. I've given up all hope of ever reading the next Song of Ice and Fire book. Jon Snow, I may never know your fate, but reading about the Malazan empire might keep me from caring for awhile!
B001U7ADZ4|5.0|I heard John Mayer and Phillip Phillips were touring together so being a fan of Phillip I sought out John Mayer's music.  I was not disappointed !  Love 90% of the songs and still enjoy the other 20%.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Downloaded this for my 6 year old granddaughter.  I like that the game can be geared for different ages.  It has given both of us hours of fun.  The different levels are challenging but fun.  Bright graphics make it a lot of fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app really needs an update for levers and switches badly but it's still an awesome game and I love it
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I loved this book whoever is reading this review you should really read this book it is one of the best books I have ever read
B0028DRGDQ|4.0|This is a great zombie flick. It's in Spanish with English subtitles but is very entertaining.  This is the movie that inspired the English &#34;quarantine&#34;.. When a reporter covering a story about firemen tags along on a call about some kind of emergency at an apartment building they find a sick, violent old woman and soon discover there is some kind of infection and the CDC will not let them out.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I was blindsided by this book's thought provoking-ness.  I love how the plot and characters have such intricate layers.  I really enjoyed the format in which the book is written.
B00003CWOL|5.0|What a great movie. As funny is it is, it's actually very smart and heartfelt... Jay and silent bob are apostles and alanis morset is god. 5 stars!
B00594XOZU|1.0|This app used to work perfectly fine until today. I tried to open it &amp; it kept saying &quot;kik messenger has stopped&quot; so I restarted &amp; it happened again. I then uninstalled it &amp; then reinstalled &amp; I couldn't even log back in. Please fix this!
B00DW0TFP6|5.0|Best album I ever buy. (:E<br /><br />Live again, all roads end, I'll be coming home<br /><br />No even stars last foREVer
B0083Z614S|4.0|I have never read this book before but I have seen the movie since I was little. I wish I read the book first because when I it I knew what will happen. This was a tough read for me because I have never read Yorkshire before in my life. Reading Yorkshire is very difficult especially if you read is out loud to your self but through out the book you get the gist of what certain phrases mean. I love the characters in the book. To me the book got a little boring at 75% threw the book but I loved the ending. I definitely recommend this book if you are looking for something difficult to read (I've never read many difficult books but when I say this I mean they is A LOT of Yorkshire in here) I also recommend this book if you haven't watched the movie(that's why I put 4 stars). I have no idea what age group this book is for but I loved it and I recommend it for any age. Hope this was an awesome review.
0515153656|5.0|I recently discovered the books of Lee Child and he has quickly become a favorite author!<br />Recommend you add him to your reading list.
B004GKMV16|5.0|This is the second time I've read this book - the first time in hard back.  Once again I loved it!  Edward Rutherford has a real knack of taking a country, city or era, and in his own inimitable way, weaving his characters into a fascinating historical novel.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|Received very fast and in A-1 condition. I saw the movie a couple of times on TV and loved it both times, so I decided to buy it. Have watched it twice since I received it.  It  shows you some of the things a daughter her age might go thru, being the daughter of the President of the United States.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I Can't Ever Update My Kik Name. It's Been The Same For Monthss! It's Kinda Stupid And I NEED to Change It.
1594203334|2.0|I was enjoying reading this book. There were interesting points and I figured I could add them in to whatever parenting philosophies I decide on. Obviously it was written from a very upper class viewpoint (although the author seemed to be naive to that point, despite the fact that she mentions it at the beginning of the book). Sadly, in the 8th to last page in the book, she totally discredits herself and every interesting point she had made with an alarmingly racist and completely unnecessary remark. pg 256: \\"I've accepted that if we stay in France, my kids probably won't ever learn to shoot a bow and arrow. (God forbid they're ever attacked by eighteenth-century American Indians.)\\" I read the \\"after-thought\\" clause in disbelief. I actually reread it, hoping that maybe it actually said something like \\"attacked by a bear.\\" But no, upon second reading, it was still incredibly racist and completely unnecessarily so. It really spoke to the naivete of the author and took away any credibility she had built up. I certainly recommend NOT buying this book. She doesn't deserve the royalties. No one should feel free to (or \\"accidentally\\") use racist comments like that in 2013. If you must read it, check it out from the library.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Season three is the best of the entire series, very intense! Discs came in packed neatly without a scratch! Should def. buy!
B00FKSJ3YG|5.0|Many of the reviews say there's room for improvement, and of course I agree. But some things to consider is that it's just starting out, so there's plenty of time for things to really pick up. And Joss Whedon's writing is always enjoyable. I giggled many times. Many.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Gut-wrenching !  I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Can't wait for the next episode .
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|For anyone wondering what happen to &#34;redrum&#34; boy, this book is the answer. It's been over 20 years since I've been to the overlook hotel, as soon as I started reading, I was instantly back there, Mrs. Massey et al. The expansion on the people in adult Dan's life is the perfect compliment in moving his story forward. I highly recommend this book to anyone else who has spent time in the old overlook hotel.<br /><br />Shelly
B0042816YK|5.0|This movie is inspiring! I love almost every movie Julia Roberts has starred in and all the characters are well developed and believable! Do yourself a favor and watch this-I almost guarantee you won't be disappointed! Especially if you are one that is looking for inspiration in life and perhaps some direction.
B003UYV08E|4.0|Not as good as the 1st one and they make him way to cocky in this one. I read all the comics and Tony Starks wasn't that bad. It was still a cool movie and I do own all 3.
0141199547|5.0|beautiful clothbound!!!  Your bookshelf will look good!<br />Vanity Fair is an entertaining book and after the first 40 pages you just an't get yours eyes away from it!
B0042MEQVG|3.0|So my review for all this series is the same. It is a total chic flick with some good action every now and then. You might be stuck listening to you girlfriend jock shark boy or Mr. forehead and it does drag every now and then, but if you get them for a good price, what the hell buy them.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Is it possible to like a book but not enjoy the story? If so, that describes my review. It reminded me too much his other book Coraline, only this time with a young boy and magical mysteries to solve. Though, this book is incredibly scarier than Coraline.<br /><br />Being young and trapped in your house by a monster is every person's nightmare. I enjoyed having the young boys parent so oblivious to his problems that he needed help from the 'special' neighbors. But, this was a drawn out novella in my mind. Too terrifying for children to read and not enough terror for adults to enjoy.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|Absolutely gripping!  Beautifully tied up storylines.  Fantastic research on locations and techniques, certainly believeable to the spy novel reading lay person, I'm not sure if I want to know exactly how real this could be.  I loved every chapter.
0385347774|5.0|I read this novel and then went on the hunt for more written by Gillian Flynn.  I found a couple, but this one was by far my favorite, but the others were good as well. I'll be looking out for new releases from this author.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Nice to see a good sci-fi show that has some depth and is well acted. Just found this on Amazon Prime and got caught up in enough to buy season three. Tough to find descent quality shows like this, most cable networks go with rude and crude and far too much foul language. Appreciate Falling Skies not going down that path.
1781162646|5.0|You'll like this novel.  It was typical King.  Easy to get sucked into, well developed characters, and a nice quickly moving plot.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|My daughter cried when she received this. That's all I need to say tears off happiness make me happy. Both my daughters have watched it over and over again.
B005MMZ63C|3.0|No a bad movie but you have to pay attention from the beginning.I am supprise it won an award. Won't watch if you are sleepy.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Its an ok version.  Constantly moving, but other than the regular flow of violence, no real Dredd shows up in this movie.
B008JFUN50|4.0|I fell in love with Neill Blomkamp's first film \\"District 9\\"; the South African filmmaker's take on a sci-fi film was really brilliant and shows how a filmmaker with a unique storytelling voice can create something new and exciting. It was an eye-opening experience and even more remarkable because it was the filmmaker's first full-length feature.<br /><br />His second film \\"Elysium\\" is not quite as ground-breaking or original, but it does add a unique voice, making it a more interesting sci-fi film. In a less talented director's hands, \\"Elysium\\" would be a routine sci-fi programmer, the type of film quickly forgotten and relegated to endless cable runs. But Blomkamp's vision and style help ensure that \\"Elysium\\" will be remembered as a highlight of the summer.<br /><br />Los Angeles in 2154 is an overpopulated, toxicly polluted, dry and brown landscape in which people toil at meaningless jobs and struggle to survive. Yes, I said 2154 and not 2013. The working class is essentially stuck on Earth in what is a police state. The rich and wealthy live on a space station that looks like Beverly Hills and comes complete with machines able to heal any sickness or ailment. The people on Earth make attempts to board Elysium, to take advantage of the healing machines, but Delacourt (Jodie Foster), the head of Defense, quickly orders these errant spaceships shot down. Back on Earth, Max (Matt Damon) gets involved in an accident at work and becomes irradiated. He soon learns he has five days to live. Struggling to figure out how to survive, he meets mercenaries who offer to help him; they will strap a metal framework to his body and use intelligence stolen from Carlyle (William Fichtner) to get past Elysium's security network. As Max struggles with these preparations (the framework is physically attached to his body), he reconnects with Frey (Alice Braga), a girl he grew up with in an orphanage. She now has a daughter who is sick and about to die, giving Max even more reason to get to Elysium. But Delacourt also has a rogue warrior, Kruger (Sharlito Copley), in her pocket and enlists him to stop Max and help her restore order.<br /><br />Written and directed by Blomkamp, the narrative of \\"Elysium\\" is presented in an economical way, which keeps the story moving and holds your interest. There is a very brief intro before we watch an unauthorized shuttle approach the space station. We watch Delacourt go into action and then focus on Max back on Earth. Max labors through every day, much like the other people living in Los Angeles, but he does what he has to do and tries to remain positive about everything. We quickly learn about his living situation, his job, what life is like in this Los Angeles. It isn't great. A lot of sci-fi films run over two hours and this is usually attributed to the set-up and backstory necessary to get us involved in the story. Blomkamp doesn't stop the narrative to give us details, he gives us the details as part of the narrative. It is so much more engaging to learn these things as the story unfolds - because so much is happening, we pay closer attention and enjoy the finer points of this filmmaker's work.<br /><br />Max lives in a little shack in the middle of an even more run-down part of town. This is the part of town run by Spider (Wagner Moura), the man behind constant attempts to get sick people up to Elysium for treatment. He finally comes up with a plan and Max is the key. But Max is a reluctant hero and takes some convincing. When he decides to help Spider out, the process proves to be painful, continuously forcing Max to prove his determination to help. Watching Max's journey also propels us further into his universe and life.<br /><br />There are a lot of things going on in \\"Elysium\\". Spider wants to get sick people to the space station, to receive treatment. This is a driving force in his life. But he also wants to get people up there - any people - to help break the exclusivity of this place, to smash the class barrier. He uses one obsession as a mask for another.<br /><br />Matt Damon's Max is an interesting reluctant hero. Max seems happy to be just surviving. In fact, after he has an accident and work and receives a dire prognosis, his desire to continue living drives him to take the next steps to help Spider and become part of his team. Throughout the journey we share with Max, we learn about him and his view of life, we see a few moments he shared with Frey when they were kids, moments that foreshadow who they will both become. It is a surprisingly complex character and Damon brings a lot to the role.<br /><br />Jodie Foster plays Delacourt, the head of security for Elysium. She is a steely woman who doesn't seem to think twice about ordering a shuttle of Earth refugees shot down before it reaches Elysium. Her focus is to keep the people of Elysium safe and her focus never wavers. Even when the President questions her and threatens to reprimand her, she seems to consider these to be minor inconveniences and continues forward with her duties, never missing a step. In fact, the threat of a reprimand only serves to make her take the next step in her plan.<br /><br />Sharlito Copley plays Kruger, a mercenary under the thumb of Delacourt, willing and able to do whatever it takes to fulfill his responsibilities. Copley, the star of \\"District 9\\", adds a unique character to the film. As soon as Kruger sees the power shifting, he takes advantage of the situation to the best of his ability. And this allows Copley to really allow Kruger to become larger than life. He is almost a human version of the Terminator, pursuing his goals with an unhuman tenacity.<br /><br />The fact that the name of the space station Elysium - where all of the rich and privileged live, and where they have no worries, no sickness - is borrowed from Greek mythology adds another level of interest to the film and shows the creativity of Blomkamp. It goes back to that 'unique storyteller' thing I was talking about earlier. Let's face it, many won't get the reference - many writers and directors probably wouldn't - so when a filmmaker does, you sit up and take notice. Everyone wanted to go to the Elysium Fields, paradise, like heaven, to be with family and friends, to never get sick again. The Elysium in this film is remarkably similar to Beverly Hills - large estates, predominately white marble, lots of green spaces. The only difference is the slight curve to the landscape to reflect the curve in the space station.<br /><br />Once Max and Kruger arrive at Elysium, the film falters a bit and becomes more conventional. They battle each other, fighting to the death. It is a well-orchestrated fight, but it doesn't offer a lot of new visual material for us to savor, material that Blomkamp has already earned a reputation for.<br /><br />The entire final act falters slightly, veering very close to a routine sci-fi conclusion. This is disappointing because everything up to that point is really good, memorable and interesting.<br /><br />Blomkamp is a skilled craftsman, capable of creating a unique moviegoing experience. I hope he continues to use his skill, his voice, to create many, many more films to come.e class barrier.

B008TRH5N6|5.0|....the power each of us holds within our own minds, to create whatever reality we choose.  Actually, we are creating our reality whether we believe it or not, so we might as well create it perfectly.  This book is a CLASSIC and should be required reading of every high school student.  Oh what a different world we would have if that was the case.
B007Q476KU|2.0|My wife and I thought that the writing  was trite and predictable.  Too many unbelievable situations.  The photography was above average and there were many beautiful bucolic scenes.
0920668372|2.0|I know everyone loves this book but I didn't. I thought it was really touching but also really sad. For my 3 year old son who has had to deal with a sick mama in the hospital this past year....it was a terrible story. He was really sad when the mama got old and died. Maybe he would like it when he is older?
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|it constantly makes whatever device I play freeze after about 3 games &amp; I don't get the lives sent to me by other players. I can accept them but they never make it to the life bar. other than that , when it works I love it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love the set up of this Android App. But the thing I love the most about it is how it syncs with my laptop and my Windows Phone. They even have an app for my blackberry playbook too (although that app definitely needs some work). Overall, Thank you, Evernote for your great product!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Lots of fun.Excellent brain exercises requiring memory and logic. Excellent for killing time. Hope they add more levels soon. Thanks
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Thank you God for this game and every thing else. I love this gave as much as my mom does. If my teacher was to see me playing this she will say &quot;Sarah u are good at this game.&quot;
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I liked the game.  It was actually addicting but it costs money to keep playing if you aren't any good at it like I was.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love  this game so much. My mom loves it too. My mom is playing it every day long. My mom loves this game more than I DO! This is Sarah and peace out.
B0063FGG22|5.0|&#34;North by Northwest&#34; is considered to be one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest films. Some people claim it as their favorite. I myself have 4 other favorites, but it is certainly one of his top 5 films. It is a fantastic ride from beginning to end and everyone should own it in their collection!<br /><br />Luckily, this was given a loving transfer to Blu-Ray. Both the picture and sound quality is quite wonderful. I am often disappointed when I upgrade from a DVD to a Blu-ray. Sometimes, there seems to be little or no improvement in picture quality. Other times, improvement is minimal. I am glad that this film was given the care that it deserved.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I loved this book by Anita Moorjani! I was amazed by her story of her NDE. I think this book will help me in finding my own awareness in living fearlessly.
B004IK9SQ0|5.0|Oscar Wilde said, &#34;Great genius is the ability to make the complicated simple, not the other way around.&#34; Ernest Holmes makes understanding the great questions of life, simple.<br />As a life time student of the Bible, I find Holmes provides a simple way to understand it, finally.<br />We are responsible to work with God, and Holmes shows in simple terms how to do it.<br />Other thinkers use Holmes work as a source material.<br />This book has changed my life for the better, and continues to change it as I refer back to it for guidance when confused.<br />It can do the  same thing for you.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|I don't watch zombie movies, or vampire flicks but we heard the good reviews on this movie and decided to watch it. Glad we did, implied gore - but not over the top.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|If you are on the fence about this book...just buy it already. I.COULD.NOT.PUT.IT.DOWN.  It was a serious page turner and at the end (which I completed at 1:30am on a workday!!) my heart was still just racing.  If you like survival stories, you'll like this one!
076790592X|5.0|One of the best books out there.  I loved it so much I had to buy my own copy after borrowing my mom's for years and years.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|The series held our interest from the beginning to the end. Couldn't wait for the next week to watch the new episode.
B00EF9339M|4.0|This book helped me understand some new concepts, and get a firmer grasp of concepts I had previously known under a less vivid light. I didn't give it 5* because some parts in the middle are redundant, but I found it a very good read nonetheless and I will read through it again.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|It's great not to discard Star Trek simply because all the stories have been told. I was skeptical of the reboot, but loved the first movie and this one is even better. To boot, most of the cast is first rate. I don't think Pyne eclipses Shatner by any means, but why should he need to? I love all the others just as I loved all the old ones. Really very great stuff and a great watch.
006178480X|3.0|Another episode of Sigma force.<br /><br />This story is a bit fractured, with part of the team off doing their own thing for about half the book before joining the main story line.  It winds up detracting from the overall story instead of contributing.  All the main players are there plus a couple of new ones, making for a good mix of characters.<br /><br />Doing this novel via audio book, I found the reader a bit stilted and lacking in flow, not nearly as good as some of the previous readers of Rollings work.
B00969PR18|1.0|It didn't calculate where we were.<br />Also, we had to have an address of where we wanted to go.<br />Not just the City name. It needs a street name and address too.
B006H5120E|4.0|The 3D version makes all the difference in viewing this movie.  I enjoyed that aspect.  It is a good movie for history buffs.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|For my first knife sharpener it really works great, it puts a really good razors edge on them but mainly for small kinds like pocket and pairing knifes.
B002BWP49C|3.0|My daughter in law loved this series.  I found it to be entertaining, but it is not my type of viewing.  It is entertaining though.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|E.L. James is no great writer, the plot is fully &#34;wholly&#34; and the characters don't have much depth. If you are after a classic in the making this is not for you. This is erotica and will give you some understanding of S&M sex toys and what goes on behind closed doors of kinky sex. I enjoyed the read and went through all three books in less than a week. Another facet of the same subject is explored by Paulo Coelho in 11 Minutes. I am no big fan of his either but he is a far better writer than James. However I found the book entertaining and curious and enjoyed it for what it is worth.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|My daughter in law loved this series.  I found it to be entertaining, but it is not my type of viewing.  It is entertainig though.
B006BFK5DK|3.0|Not what I expected.  It did not have that ewf feel to me.  The last one was much better.  Too much Phillip
B006WWTKQ0|4.0|Great Kids DVD.  I like it, but my grand kids are crazy about it.  Highly recommend for small children. Some ground ups loved it also.
B00BS3EMNY|4.0|I ran into this music by accident, and really enjoyed it. It is has retro feel to it; my favorites are Liquid Lunch and Tangled Up.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|My whole family loves this series and this particularly one appears to be the best of the the three.  Highly recommend this.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It works for me really well. My friends refereed me this product to cast videos from laptop to tv.<br /><br />Thanks
B00DIJQAI6|5.0|It feels like mario kart it's amazing it lasts and you can be any Sega character in the game but the best part of the game is . It's fun get it
B0064X7FVE|1.0|that mpoint thing has made it into a 0 star app. more bugs in the thing than my crotch. hgo back to the old version.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I wont really give a deep review, because you'll either watch it based off the hype or not.  I will say that you would be hard pressed to find a better shot western or anything for that matter.  Pretty much every aspect is perfect.
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|Another excellent book that continues the theme of the previous 2 books and helps one to understand and desire dedicating oneself to studying A Course In Miracles.  Great job Gary!!!
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Why have I never heard of this band before?  Great songs, there is not one song that I don't like.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have read a good amount of King in my life, but never had I been so excited to continue reading.  I read The Shining years ago, but was able to follow this plot without any trouble. I loved the characters which helped when the focal points of chapters changed, and the editing was great. This is easily my favorite book of 2013. And easily my favorite King novel. I cannot speak more highly of this book. Two thumbs way up.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|Relaxing music for my ears. I like it but no other song in this cd comes close to &#34;Over the Rainbow.&#34;
B000LTAY1U|5.0|It's a Seiko......for a great price, so good value for the money. Since I like a slimmer watch surface, I like it's size, although it took a little time to get used to it. I especially like the see through back face.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I have enjoyed reading this book series, but this book seemed very choppy, and I feel there are a lot of loose ends as to what happened to many of the characters.  It was a very abrupt ending.  My favourite book was the third in series.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|Don't waste your time or money on this game. It suddenly quit working on me and will no longer load. The tech support team tells me<br />the same thing to reboot my device and shut of wi-fi but this never works. I asked them if I re-install will I be able to recover my<br />progress and they said no, even though the game supports Amazon game circle.<br />The other problem is the game lures you into playing by making it easy at first. But as you progress it gets much harder to defeat your enemies<br />and you basically have to spend a lot of cash to purchase advanced weapons and shields so it's a big waste of money. And the game is not stable<br />and if your internet is down or disconnected it goes into a loop and you can't quit the game without rebooting your device or do a force stop<br />of the game. Very disappointing.
B00DYXKJII|1.0|This expensive filter is very flimsy. I really had high hopes for it as it seemed like a very clever idea. However, it's cheaply made, mostly of plastic so don't expect it to last very long.  Two dives and both pieces were messed up.  The red filter has hairline cracks all over it and the macro flip lens got scratched with only minimal usage. Not sure how the filter could have possibly gotten shattered unless just putting it on the camera did it. The ad says it's glass but it must be terribly thin and very fragile, a bad thing for diving. If you buy one of these make sure you CAREFULLY take the filter off the camera immediately after every use and put back into the little bag and into a hard storage case. I'm very careful with my equipment and keep everything in padded cases during travel and transit. I didn't drop the camera or set it down on the macro 'lens'. I wish I could have gotten hold of the company about these issues but the other reviewer says they don't respond so I didn't try.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Clearer picture of what it was really like.  The SEALS are amazing.  They are truly well trained, and it takes a certain human to attain the title.  Seals must have a  sixth sense to do their work effectively.  Awesome reading - keeps you wanting to go back and finish the book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was amazing. Cover to cover. This book is a definite ate Must read(: it really makes you feel what the characters feel and fall in love with them as you go along.
B000001FKY|5.0|Another wonderful CD that I couldn't live without. I couldn't find the song I wanted on I Tunes, so I bought the CD and downloaded all the songs onto the computer. Now I have them all!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved this book.  Lots of intertwined story lines keeps the reader guessing. I thoroughly enjoyed it all the way through the epilogue.
B000001DV2|5.0|Def Leppard is one of my all time favorites. I couldn't buy it on I Tunes, so I bought the CD instead. Then downloaded it onto my computer.
B006YJIIC8|5.0|I heard someone talking about this show so I finally started watching and I absolutely love it. You cant stop watching once you start!!!
B00992CF6W|3.0|Runs slow on kindle fire HD 7&#34;<br />The prior version to this was working well.<br />It glitches a lot as well!!
B00DZAWPNM|2.0|All right, I've been following Panic! for a while now, and I've always had respect for them. Their first album, \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\", while clearly following in the footsteps of bands such as Fall Out Boy, nonetheless offered a memorable, refreshing take on the emo-pop formula. And even though their second effort \\"Pretty Odd\\" was deeply flawed (and had the feel of a band going through an identity crisis), it did nonetheless have a few gems that were satisfying (like \\"Nine In the Afternoon\\"), and I did respect them for trying to create a Beatles-esque sound. And like many Panic! fans, while their third album certainly wasn't without its large share of filler tracks, I found the third effort to be a satisfying return to form for the band.<br /><br />Now on to this album.<br /><br />First, the lyrics are no departure from their previous efforts. The overwhelmingly dominant issue with this album is the style and production of the music itself. The production is FAR too shiny, overshadowing the guitars and other instruments utilized on this effort. In fact, Brendon's voice itself is cloaked in electronics to the point where he sounds robotic for most of the songs. Also, the structuring of most of the songs themselves suffer. Nearly all the tracks lack build-up to a crescendo or lyrical high point, making it sound as if they go nowhere (\\"Miss Jackson\\" is an example of a song that suffers from this problem). In fact, the vast majority of the tracks here don't even have the feel of a Panic! effort. The album feels more like a collection of B-sides from Depeche Mode and Daft Punk, an unnatural and abrupt change of tune from any of their older material. The only song on this album that truly feels like something from Panic! is \\"This is Gospel\\", and it is a track that sounds like it would fit well on any of Panic!'s prior releases.<br /><br />Now, I'm not against bands changing their sound. Bands have to grow and mature, or else risk repeating the same formula to the point where they eventually sound largely stale and dull on their later efforts (like 3 Doors Down). And believe me, the last thing I would want is for Panic! to recreate \\"Fever\\" every time they do an album. But for a band to change its sound, it must be done very carefully. Some bands have been able to go about it the right way (such as The Beatles and Green Day) by doing so gradually and within the natural progression of the band's sound. Some bands have gone about it somewhat hapharzadly, resulting in efforts that produce a mixture of some of a band's best work and some of their worst (like Fall Out Boy did on their new album, and like Linkin Park did on their effort \\"A Thousand Suns\\").  Many, however, changed so drastically that they lost almost any semblance of who they are as a band (like The All-American Rejects and Relient K on their new albums). Unfortunately for Panic!, it appears that they went about it the wrong way this time, changing so abruptly and so suddenly that this new effort fails to capture the spirit of the band itself.  At least on \\"Pretty Odd\\", there were some remaining traces of their trademark sound, even if it was a haphazard effort.<br /><br />That's not to say that there aren't any good things about the album. Brendon's voice sounds good, with or without the electronics. \\"This is Gospel\\", like I said earlier, is the highlight of this effort, and should definitely be purchased. And I do recommend taking a listen to \\"Miss Jackson\\", \\"Nicotine\\", and \\"The End of All Things\\".<br /><br />In closing, it appears that, in an attempt to distance themselves from their emo-pop/pop-punk past, Panic! literally panicked by going disco, resulting in a large collection of forgettable, stale songs. I still do care about them and I wish them the best of luck, but this album is a misfire.point where they eventually sound largely stale and dull on their later efforts (like 3 Doors Down).

B009R5GR1K|4.0|This app is very versatile and easy to use. I like the articles related to history and the games too.
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|This album is all that is beautiful about rock and roll,and it kinda blows you away with it.Myles Kennedy's vocals are haunting and perfect and the music speaks for itself.Hats off you guys,you have outdone yourself.
B001BANK32|5.0|I reread &#34;The Shining&#34; to refresh my memory and to get set up for Stephan King's newest book, &#34;Dr. Sleep.&#34;  Stephan King is my favorite author. He pushes all of my literary buttons. The Shining was even better the second time I read it. Mr. King does have a way with words.  As a teacher, I am fascinated by Stephan's &#34;voice&#34; in writing.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Keeps you riveted. What's next?  Twists and turns that make it hard to put the book down. Grisham is a master.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Is am ten years old and I was crying.  It was so sad but it gets a lot better.  I loved this book and I hope you do too.
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|Definitely not a waste of time. It had me from the get go. Not for the faint of heart.another book I couldn't put down. Thanks Todd.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|love this game to bad it freezes so much. Wish it gave more chips or cards were cheaper to play.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|Just about as much fun as ABSW 1 but not quite. Might just be me but seemed to lack a little something. Maybe its just TOO simular to number one.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I think Rick Riordan took the word cliff hanger too literally. I love this book can't wait to get house of hades.
B005LAII8A|4.0|Well packaged and I love the plus of getting the UltraViolet Digital Copy.  That is what drew me in hook, line, and sinker.  This way I am able to see the movie on my iPad, iPhone, pc, or anywhere really.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I. Love this game I have not played all the rooms yet but I am looking forward to it!  If you like bingo you must try this one
B004EBT5CU|5.0|We all know how talented and fabulous Adele is.  I play this CD all the time.  Now I'm working on collecting the sheet music!
B00594XOZU|1.0|This app won't allow me to create account. It continues to load and than proceed to time out. My daughters kindle fire is also doing the same thing.
B000056TKD|5.0|Everyone should own a decent copy of this masterpiece.  I recommend getting a copy of the orchestra sheet music and follow along.  Fascinating!!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I had no problems.  It worked great. No hitch and no glitches.  It did what it was supposed to do and it did it great.
B000002KOJ|5.0|I have wanted this CD I listened to on vinyl in my youth. It was a delight to get it in the mail, and very nostalgic.<br />Thank you vendor that sent it in excellent shape.
B004GYY714|4.0|I didn't give it a 5 star because it didn't carry a radio station in San Diego that I wanted to listen to.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Found it confusing and rambling. Probably need to watch again sometime.  I did like the creativity of the airplane etc.
0486266885|4.0|I was first suprised by the size of this book, and i could not understand how it could have acquired this amount of fame and how it still is very alive after so much time, but after reading it it i understood completely.<br />Easy to understand and gripping even thou i knew the ending!
B0087JTAKW|2.0|Mr. Albom failed to deliver the beauty and passion that were in his former books. Total letdown. Too many cliches, too predictable.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Excellent for what I need to pull the vid or audio down for when I know I will be offline
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Excellent app, does what it's supposed to do, easy to read, use and understand. I would recommend this app for every kindle fire user.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|I am at a stand still in the game as a crucial repeater puzzle seems to have a glitch.  There is one puzzle you must do for each season, it worked for winter but then stopped.  If it doesn't change to the other seasons you can't move on.  I will try reloading but it is frustrating.<br /><br />The Room on the other hand was awesome!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was very engaging and an overall thrill. I can honestly say I hope the rest of the series is just as entertaining.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game.  It has beautiful graphics and nice puzzles.  It does remind me of Myst as others have stated.  It did freeze here and there, had to exit and restart but not enough to really annoy me and it was so great to look at and fun to do didn't really mind.  I'm looking forward to the next one from Fireproof - very talented.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazingly enough I loved this read.  It's definitely on my buy list. One of the best read in a long while!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This is probably the best free phone game I've had the pleasure of playing. I wish there were more like it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Really a fun game I enjoy it and it is slightly addictive I will continue to play so long as it does not hectoring tipped
B002GHHHL0|5.0|Great movie, good condition. The quality met the quality described on amazon. DVD does not skip, and as an added bonus the DVD was not pirated from a local library.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Great movie!! Action packed and even with zombies! Brad Pitt can save me any day;-) love that it works out well
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game!  It's cute, adorable, and fun for the entire family.  My son enjoys it just as much, if not more, than I do.
B00B2166BS|5.0|No more dealing with that mini USB port.  Just get the POGO close to the port and the magnets connect it up like magic
B00ET0PZDO|3.0|For the price I didn't expect much but it turned out to be a fun little game though fairly short. Good game for a buck so spend your money and give it a try!
B008M87GJK|5.0|Best news anywhere  Excellent USA news.  World news UK news and everything in between.  Well written articles and commentary  Good layout easy to understand
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I have all the Angry Birds games on my PC, but this latest update would not load;  it did load on my new Kindle Fire; most parts are previous versions, but there are new features as well.  Its portable and entertaining.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Good read.  Engrossing.  Can't put in down.  Plot thin is some places.  Character development so-so.  Plot about the same formula as his other reads
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome book very easy to read beautiful story if you are looking for a happy ending this the book to read , once you start it you gotta finish it
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Lots of fun with the larger screen of the Kindl over the iPhone.  Would like more games for the Kindl.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|This app is so much better than pandora. No long pauses and i can fast foward as many times as i want. Never ever had a problem.  Great App!!!!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|This tells one persons way to succeed on some levels but definitely does not help on all levels.  Takes you to UTube videos.  Not helpful at all.
B0061US58C|2.0|We rented this movie from Amazon Instant Video, thinking that my 3 year old son would love it.....especially since he loves the original Cars movie.  HOWEVER, Cars 2 has numerous scenes with gunfire shooting, and they frequently reference that they are going to \\"kill\\" certain cars.  I did not appreciate all of the weapons and killing of cars in a movie intended for small children.  My son kept asking \\"what are they doing mommy?\\".  A little hard to explain....and unnecessary.  My son eventually walked away to his room to play and my husband and I ended up watching it....only since we had paid for the rental.  Like most Pixar movies, it was full of color and ultimately had a good message about friendship, but I would not watch it again.  I do not recommend.  I hope Pixar doesn't make another children's movie with gunfire and violence.  We certainly won't be watching it.
B007G5H2HQ|5.0|Well animated, cute story line. Both children and adults were able to watch it and enjoy it together. Would highly recommend. :)
B00640UICA|5.0|TimesBoth myself And 10 Year Old Love Joining Hands!I Love The Profiles Options, My Progress Is Saved And See Has Her Own Profile.

B009LDD22U|5.0|My wife and I have been fans from the beginning.  We are amazed how the show continues to remain funny and fresh.  Definitely recommended!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I highly recommend this series to everyone!  Everything about it is extremely well done.  The actors and actresses give incredibly believable performances of those who would have lived during this period of time.  Especially enjoyable and informative has been the relationship between the aristocracy and their servants.  I am continually in awe of my new insights into this historical period and the fascination of how drastically society has changed.  The Abbey with its furnishings, the clothing and jewelry...are amazing and transport one into this fascinating period of history.  I'm so addicted to these characters and their story, I can't wait to purchase the 4th season (although I wish I had the self-restraint to watch it weekly.)
B00FN811SY|5.0|If you are interested in learning what the Bible really says, this is the ultimate translation to have... and it's FREE!
B004GJDQT8|1.0|it worked for sometime them stop i uninstalled and re installed will not work xxx xxx xxx xxxs sss ssse  sucks
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|Can't fairly rate the movie as the Amazon streaming was so bad that evening that we could not watch it (streaming was interrupted every couple of minutes).
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|The story line was just fantastic and very realistic.. Because of this book I have selected another one of Mr Child's books to read.
B000YAA68C|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this. I wanted to head to Ireland & find my own singing, fun-loving Irishman. (I didn't, though. I knew that wasn't meant for me.)
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Great Actors/Actress and all episodes are fantastic to watch. I am glued to it now, what else can I say?
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I loved learning about Beatrix Potter's life & the beautiful Lakes District where she chose to make her home. It was unusual for a woman to make it on her own at that time. I watch it again every now & then.
B00BOUL9DM|4.0|some are really easy, but suddenly, one pops up that makes you scratch your head.  I like when we get those.  Me and the wife double team those ones and sometime have to put the game away and come back with fresh eyes.
B007HUD6OS|2.0|I typically enjoy john grisham's books, but honestly this was pitiful.  Nothing compelling or interesting about it.  Maybe it makes a good Disney movie one day but it was not an entertaining book.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love a game that makes you think about what you are doing.  fills my time when I need a break and great to get the old brain cells going.  A little hard to understand at the beginning, but once I got going it was game on.  Try going back to regular solitaire afterwards to try to get your brain back to black and red!
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|I found that some of it was somewhat simplistic.<br /><br />And although I am a huge believer in the LOA and have manifested quite a few great things in the past, I didn't quite manifest the anticipated experiment results predicted in the book.
0060254920|5.0|Had to buy it for my grandchildren.  Our copy is old and tattered.  My children loved this book.  So glad it's still out there.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|My granddaughter is almost three and she adore Blu. She walks up to me and says &#34; crazy love hawk from the movie. It is thoroughly entertaining for all of us and the music is fantastic. I bought it for the G rating and fell in love with the story and music.
0060229357|5.0|I remember this book from when my children were little so when I saw it on Amazon, I just knew my grandchildren would love it too.  I was right!  Thanks Amazon.
B009FBX5M0|5.0|This film is a classic, and shows the human element of James Bond.  Surprising plot, with unexpected ending.  This is not a high tech type Bond film, but one that relies on the characters in the film. A classic.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Dirty, but fast reading. It keeps your interest and their is always a surprise on the next page.. I would buy it again
B009PMEEY2|4.0|I've played this type of game so many times that it gets boring after awhile.  The graphics were very good, the game play was OK.  At times I lost contact with the items on the grid board and had to re-do the line.  You need small fingers for this game, I was playing it on my Acer A500 tablet and had some trouble keeping to the selection path on the grid, not good when you're running out of time.  The story line was lacking, but then they all do.<br /><br />Would I buy this game?  no, however, I'd play it again.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I liked that this was a different kind of love story with a different kind of ending. Beautifully written. Held my interest.
034580404X|5.0|I loved the books once it got to the story rather than the sex. I persevered through the first book and I'm so glad I did.
B00CS65QGW|4.0|When I heard this group play this song. I just had to have it. Thank you Amazon for always providing me with excellent music.
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|Bought this on the recommendation of a friend when I was telling her how much my husband & I were enjoying our purchase of Star Trek Original TV Series DVDS.  You don't have to be a Trekkie fan to enjoy this brilliant take on Actors & our obsession, and some times innocence, in believing characters are real... GREAT CAST, GREAT FUN, GREAT PRICE!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|This was an enjoyable read with great insight. I do think the book was a lot of the same message over an dover but I appreciated the statistics she provided to back up her insight. One point she did not address sufficiently was how essential having a partner who supports your career and family choices is to achieve what she has.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is, I think, fascinated by unusual powers wielded by unlikely humans. I never get tired of reading about them. &#34;Steelheart&#34; kept me interested all the way through, although I did cringe a little at what I thought was the overuse of the dubious title, &#34;shlontz.&#34; (Like shemozzel, or shnook.) I've forgotten teenage slang I used myself in the mists of time past. I'm happy to know there will be a second book because I want to know more about how the &#34;Epics&#34; came to be, and what &#34;Calamity&#34; really is, and Megan! What's happened to her?
B00514HDNW|5.0|Gut wrenching and hard, the sudden twist from man to monster, the hubris of man is exposed. Love. Love. Love.
B009TO99TG|5.0|What an incredible deal! Less than 20$ for four CD's! I have just recently gotten into Coldplay and I love them! If you are debating on whether to make this purchase or not, let me make it easy for you: don't pass up this deal!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  What a classic 1 and 2.  All three movies in one package.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|really was worth money i would recommend it to everyone even if you dont understand add thak you Diane blomberg
1881273377|5.0|Great book. I recommend to everyone in a relationship whether you're just dating or have been married for years. Everyone can learn from this and better themselves and their relationships.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I first told myself I wouldn't buy this as I have the original trilogy on DVD and thought I wouldn't need it. But the HD and good reviews tempted me, and boy am I glad I succumbed to the temptation. You really notice a difference in picture quality on a nice HD television.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Will probably be one of my most used apps.  The picture quality is great and it is easy to use.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a great package as it includes all 3 of Christopher Nolan's trilogy in a nice box set. The discs may just be copies of the original Blu Ray discs, so it could be a hard purchase if you already own those. However what I did was sell those original copies so I could own all three held together in a nice box.
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|...it might be something like this.  The Conjuring is by far James Wan's best film with many ingenious and well rendered visual ideas.  Many people have noted its classic approach to scares, but it is also a very Hollywood take on horror, for better and worse.  The film stars a Sherlock Holmes esque demon hunter, his wife who is a medium, and an almost cornily sweet family who are the victims.  On the plus side the film has some great uncompromising visual effects, lovely cinematography, and a great milieu that reads like a cross between The Shining and The Others.  The Conjuring isn't nearly as creepy or original as either of those films, but it makes up for it in wit and execution.  This is very much the horror movie for people who don't normally like horror movies.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|Great movie and highly recommended. Preferably you should buy it on Blu ray but if not the DVD is not bad either.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game to play as well as challenging. I am looking forward to the additional floors. Was a great way to pass the time while traveling
B008XG1X18|5.0|is an app where you can see photos, diy and ideas for anything, home, clothes fashion, etc I very fun and easy to use.
0802473156|5.0|Very good, a very warm and inspiring book. I also bought 5 love languages for children. There are lots of repeated stuff though. So I gave that book to my expecting friend as a gift.
1476734941|5.0|I learned how to fast and why, it is working great for me.Book is well written and easy to understand, we all need to learn to eat this way.
B001NIAQ9I|5.0|Barbra Streisand is absolutely stunning and phenomenal. The music in the film is perfect and the film itself is a one of a kind masterpiece.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|For a relatively long series it kept my interest throughout.  Lots of twists and turns and all within the realm of possibility.  I am now reading the &#34;Shift&#34; series which are the prequel to Wool--need to figure out how it all began.
0452257743|3.0|I thought this was the full collection including the long walk and rage and it wasn't.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It's really great and useful for the kindle. I use it to joy down notes and ideas for everyday things, even essays for my classes. I would definitely recommend this.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Kik, we've been asking for this app to be fixed for days so please do it already! Kik is the only way I can contact many people.
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|I really enjoyed my time with this book. I wouldn't say it is Brandon Sanderson's greatest book but it was a fun ride. The main character has this quirky sense of humor and is really bad at metaphors (really bad). Brandon Sanderson has a million projects he is working on and somehow managed to convince everyone to let him work on this. Listening to him talk about previous projects, he likes to take breaks and work on something different than he normally does. I would imagine it helps keep him grounded and this book has his familiar touch but is very different from his normal fantasy works. What if people in our world started developing super powers like from comics? How would that impact the world?<br /><br />It is a theme I absolutely loved and the variation on the super power world. Epics totally turn the world upside down and tear everything apart. Does absolute power corrupt absolutely? I think there are some elements that really speak the truth, if normal people started getting powers could they overcome the temptation to abuse it? Brandon Sanderson always comes up with unique twists with the powers in his books and this one is no different. He manages to weave a fun tale and describes the unique twists in a natural way without overloading with info dumps.<br /><br />While this is a very fun book and kept me up into the night reading there were a few things that annoyed me. The main character is supposed to be eighteen but he struck me as someone a bit younger, like 15 or 16. I think it was the more juvenile tone of this book, it just felt a little off. Actually that was the only thing that really annoyed me. One of my favorite characters is the Southern gentlemen who thinks he is a Scotsman. He was always going on about the wee demons powering technology but with a southern drawl.<br /><br />In the end the book comes to a satisfying conclusion with the potential for more (which I already saw an advert for the second book coming out next year...). If you are looking for a fun read, with a good comic book feel to it then you will enjoy this book!<br /><br />This book is on the Green Embers' Recommended List!oking for a fun read, with a good comic book feel to it then you will enjoy this book!<br /><br />This book is on the Green Embers' Recommended List!
B008602KQI|3.0|Too long for what it was. The buildup to the Hunger Games was too much and could have been trimmed back. Just expected more after hearing how great the book was.
0061438294|5.0|This book is phenomenal.  I think it should be mandatory reading for newbie parents, grandparents, sales professionals, pastors, anyone who interacts with anyone.  I worried that it would be me being &#34;sneaky&#34; to observe others and what their body language was &#34;saying.&#34;  However, the more I follow the information Navarro provides, the more I realize I am helping my relationships.  I have realized that many of the interactions I would have ordinarily commenced were bad timing.  I held off and waited until later, and it saved both of us grief.  Fantastic Book.  Yvonne
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I need to lower the rating on many other books I've read to illustrate how superior Dr. Sleep is in comparison. I suggest you read The Shining before reading this one, especially if you haven't read it before or if it's been a long time.<br /><br />Dr. Sleep is an excellent sequel...it could not have been better. Thanks, Stephen King.
B004SIMNF0|5.0|Love it.  Works great.  I've been wanting one of these for a very long time.  I used two cameras, one on a speed sling and one on the spider and shooting was a completely different experience.  It's rough, rugged and I wore it all day. It supports the weight on your hips.  I used a Canon Mark DII and a 70-200 with a flash. That's a lot of weight.<br />Using this was really like shooting with a gun, and it's safe as long as you use the locking switch.  If you leave it open and forget, you could potentially bend down and lose your camera from the holster.  For me that just learning to use the new tool and create new habits.<br />I was able to almost RUN with this on my hips.<br />Love it, Would recommend to any event photog.<br />Happy Shooting!<br />HP
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I rarely write reviews but I feel compelled because I almost didn't get this app simply because of the &quot;most helpful&quot; review. But I did, and I am so glad! It is so cute, and so fun. Yes, a few characters use gems to &quot;buy&quot; but gems are relatively easy to come by- you get gems if you play 4 &amp; 5 days in a row, you can get 8 gems for watching ads in both Ponyville and in Canterlot, you get gems at every level-up.... I mean c'mon, what more are you asking for! If you save your gems ( a good concept for young kids to learn!) instead of using them on the mini-games, or to skip ahead (waiting, another good concept!) then you can easily afford the main characters you need to have. My 4 &amp;5 year olds love them game- and to combat any accidental purchases, which are easy for anyone, in any game, to make- I simply always have the WiFi turned off :) It really is a great free game
B000059XUT|5.0|This is a great movie. I had only seen the third. Thanks to my three year old now we own all of them. It's a great way to buy older movies for less.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|Cher's brand new album is as good as the fans expected, if not better. Believe (1998) and Living Proof (2001) were great, but this album beats the earlier ones by several billion points! Woman's World, of course, is the signature dance track from the album, and was right up there with the other female empowerment anthems by artists such as Beyonce. My Love and Dressed to Kill were also highlights. The best song of all, though, is the last track on this version; You Haven't Seen the Last of Me. Sure we all heard it in the movie Burlesque in 2010, but it deserved being on one of Cher's own albums. I Don't Have to Sleep to Dream has a dance feel that can easily be compared to her earlier song Believe. This album should get a five-star rating from the entire fan community! Every song is well-done without a doubt. Unfortunately the planned Lady Gaga/Cher duet was dropped, but that stuff always gets leaked to YouTube. The other songs make the album totally worth having. Every time you listen to this album, Cher will bring you closer to the truth.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|Great upbeat from former Neptune.  My new ring tone!  I LOVE IT THAT PHARRELL IS MAKING HITS...KEEP THEM COMING.  YOUR FRIDAY OUT THE DOOR JAM!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I use to play mahjong years ago on the computer.<br />I'm enjoying this app and my husband is playing now too.<br />We've made a tournament out of it.
B004LP601S|5.0|This would have to be my second favorite out of all four albums (now that their fourth was released today) (Pretty. Odd. is my favorite). It's different from their first two albums, but in a way that you'll never get sick of the songs. I highly recommend adding this to your collection.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Very nice to be able to print from my phone! Hp eprint works great with just a click I can print right from my phone!
B00DZAWPNM|4.0|I've have been a fan since they began, and so what I (and their many fans) have become accustomed to is a completely new sound between albums. Fever, Pretty. Odd., Vices & Virtues, and now this album surely prove that, but this new album, in my opinion, has lost some of that true Panic!. Deep, complicated lyrics and beautiful melodies have been replaced by autotune and the pain of a band who has fallen apart. (Read Brendon's article in Alt Press, and you'll know what I'm talking about.)<br /><br />HOWEVER, I understand this band has been through quite a bit, and with Spencer on leave from the band at the moment, and through most of the production, listeners can (and will) hear the tremendous amount of emotion in the lyrics Brendon has put together.<br /><br />This Is Gospel is a personal favorite, with gems like Casual Affair and The End Of All Things not far behind. I recommend you give it a listen before buying if you're not into a pop-punk-80's sound. I, myself, am glad I bought it.
B00D6OV57O|5.0|Okay ... I was a bad listener and picked a 'favorite' song out of this album, but really, they're -all- excellent.  The songs are compiled in this orchestral score so that they flow into one another without jarring (I'm pointing at YOU, Avengers soundtrack!) and not only will the pieces bring back flashes of the movie if you happened to see it, but to a professional writer and artist myself, if you didn't see the movie (or use it as background inspiration while creating your OWN stuff) this orchestral score will inspire you to be ... well ... SUPER.
0374533571|5.0|Two actors who, in my opinion, play their characters extremely well, combined with a interesting storyline, makes this movie an instant classic. I can watch it over and over and remain hooked each time. I do recommend purchasing the book with it as it's equally as great.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have never in my life read something breath taking, so beautiful, and so sad at the same time. The book has made me even as a person want to be more great full, and more better. It's pure genius, and I recommend it to anybody.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is so awesome because my little nephew loves it and i love it too. When i play it all my friends gather around me and they love it too! It seems weird to say this but it seems like im pretty much popular now that i got it. Love the app it is great keep making apps
B0035JNTA6|3.0|This was a mostly fun movie just nothing spectacular. I found myself smiling after a few scenes rather than laughing.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|I liked it, my wife did not liked as much.  Jude Law was great playing his part.  I loved the end.
B00A2H9OZS|4.0|When I first saw the trailer of this movie, I thought it's bland. How wrong I was.<br /><br />For the first 45 minutes, the suspense was breath-taking.  I could not figure out in advance how Riddick (played by Vin Diesel) could kill the giant, scorpion-liked monsters that lived in the water.<br /><br />The special effects were  life-like and amazing, especially with the monsters and the hyena-liked dog. They did help make  the film more interesting.<br /><br />The way Riddick eliminated his hunters was also gripping. Katee Sackhoff and Jordi Mollà were convincing as bounty hunters. Matt Nable was engaging in his role. In the last half of the picture,  Jordi Mollà acted like a fool, not like the capable leader of the bounty hunters.  I did not like that.<br />The action scenes were fast paced, decisive and interesting.<br /><br />There was some humor too which made the movie more enjoyable.<br /><br />Of course, it had big logical holes but I was able to suppress my logic to enjoy the film.<br /><br />According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this movie:<br /><br />Production Budget: $38 million<br />Domestic:  $41,199,570<br />+ Foreign:  $48,000,000<br />Worldwide:  $89,199,570<br /><br />So, this movie took in 51 million dollars more than its production budget. That's a huge amount for a low budget movie. I'm sure we'll see Riddick 4 by the end of 2018.<br /><br />In short, It's definitely worth watching.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|This is a perfectly executed sequel to The Shining.<br /><br />I love that little Danny Torrance has grown up and manages to get some hard sobriety time in AA. In the afterword King speculates what might have happened to Jack Torrance if he had found AA instead of trying the 'white-knuckled method' of sobriety. Danny's 'bottom' is powerfully written and is a story that many struggling with addiction can relate to.<br /><br />I would have loved to get more time in with old Dick Halloran, but I guess this wasn't really his story anyway.<br /><br />Rose the Hat and The True Knot were formidable foes for Danny and Abra, also just scary people.<br /><br />I found The Shining scarier for different reasons. King really addressed serious family issues and the horror that addiction can wreak upon people. Doctor Sleep is excellent and definitely worth the read but it lacks some of the depth and power that The Shining has because Danny, while always struggling (as addicts are forever doomed to do ) to stay sober, /does/ stay sober, and while his 'bottom' is terrifying and terrible, it's nothing compared to what Jack Torrance's bottom was. (That is, of course, almost murdering his family while employed as a winter caretaker at a certain Overlook Hotel.)<br /><br />Anyway, read it. It does not disappoint.
B00CFQMVLS|5.0|Can't beat a good Bruce Willis movie!  I like the first scene that has Obama's picture on the wall and then the storyline goes to where Obama government doesn't help their operatives out in enemy territory, but leaves them with no support.  Classic !
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What a dunderheaded move on FOX's part to run this show only one season.  It's great!  Adventure, with great characters, Fillion is the best starship captain since Jean Luke Piccard - but more like James Kirk.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I enjoyed this. King brings back just enough of The Shining to make the new stuff fun. My only complaint SPOILER is the villans went down too easily. I wanted more of a showdown.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|This was one twisted tale that I couldn't put down. I almost finished it in one day but I had to stop and actually sleep! I'm glad I read it because it was so different from every story I've ever read that dealt with the story of Cinderella.<br /><br />First off, a cyborg Cinderella? Didn't expect that at all and I wasn't sure how it was going to work either. But some how it works amazingly well. How she sorta fits into the world she's lived in but yet how she is still pushed to the edges of society.<br /><br />Her semi normal life drastically changes after she's asked by the Prince to help fix an android, then as she's trying to fix her 'stepmother's' vehicle for little to nothing her sister becomes sick with a disease that's threatening all of Earth. She's then rushed off to 'help' with finding an antidote to help with saving not only her sister but helping the Emperor and the rest of the world. Then when she thought things couldn't get any worse they do when the Lunar kingdom's queen comes sniffing around the palace and she gets caught up in the middle of it.<br /><br />With all the twists and turns through this story, I couldn't wait to see what the next chapter brought. My only problem with this story was that I knew exactly who Cinder was early in the story and I had a feeling about how the story might turn. But I still loved this book! I would definitely read it again!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I could barely put this book down. I felt as though I re-experienced my own life's choices as I journeyed with the story's protagonist, Harold. This is a well-written, thought provoking story that allows us to think about how faith in ourselves and belief in greater good, can help us heal any of our most challenging losses.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It was outstanding in every way. A  real page-turner and a very enjoyable read with the characters very well drawn. I hated to see it come to an end.
B00355L2TU|5.0|Hard work, but I've lost a total of 11 inches using this in the past, can't wait to start it back up again!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|King has written or eras best scary stuff and so much of it 50 world wide best sellers, this is his July 2013 contribution.If any one wants to borrow one of his other ones I think I have all but one of them that we're published before I started getting digital versions
0385349831|5.0|The book was in great condition. We really like the author and you folks had the book we were looking for. My son is completely happy with the purchase and he receive it quickly. Thank you for your prompt delivery.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|This film speaks to one's own morals portrayed by the choices made by a father and the impact his son had on his conscience.
0060555661|5.0|Best investment book ever. You don't need much expertise and indepth finance knowledge to understand what the authors wants to say. And they never taught you how to win a big money, instead they tell you how much minimize the possibility to not lose money on the investment, which is really the first place to keep your own money.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Really good, the whole family enjoyed it, started of slightly slow but really picked up and delivered. We liked It alot
B0055SWM08|5.0|Nice screen.  Interesting game.  Goes slow - but interesting.  Glad to have the game on my Kindle... but will take a little getting used to.
B00280LYIM|3.0|I nice addition to the series but I can see the series without it.<br />I don't believe this book had a major role in the series.<br />But nicely written.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Fun app.  Fun game.  Kids like it and good to have it downloaded for quick/easy diversion.  Glad I purchased it.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I love the game my favorite virus is the fungus but I have found a big problem I use my warranty was deleting apps on the internet and I accidentally deleted this app and I can't restore what I have bought and I'm not going to buy them again<br />when that add that I will 5 star but overall a great game
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|Very good app.  It was fun, inspirational and interesting perspective.  Lot's of different things here - Glad to try something new.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I am a tough judge when it comes to literature. The Husband's Secret is a well written novel that begins innocently enough, by introducing you to the characters. The characters are easy to relate with and you find yourself sucked in to their story. The author does a fantastic job bringing all the characters together and at the end she leaves you with a deep thought and some honest wisdom. I really enjoyed it.
B00000J048|4.0|My grandsons love it.  very nice quality.  Easy to assemble. Only drawback is large white backing doesn't lock together so kiddos cannot pick it up. Still loads of fun
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great app there are creeper zombies skeletons and spiders I mean who would not want to buy this app although they should add enderman and add a free version so people can enjoy the lite version before u buy the real version.<br />But overall this is a great app u should buy this!
B003EVWDR0|4.0|My grandsons ages 8,9 and 13 picked out this movie to download to watch on a 16 hour road trip for vacation.  They really like the movie and and was one of the two I let them choose for vacation.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|i love this app you have to get it it makes you laugh, it is fun and it is educational. NOT THE BAD EDUCATIONAL THOUGH. Get it while it is free!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My sister got me started on this series. We watched the first two full seasons to catch up. I joined Prime just so I could see it. Love it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife and I watched Downton Abbey on Rokku and thoroughly enjoyed it, as usual. As soon as the next session comes on, we will definitely watch it as well.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Once you watch it, you'll see what all the talk is about! I cannot get enough of this show! Can't wait for the new season.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|I just loved this flick.  I was never really a big fan of the original having only seen it recently and I have to say this reimagining of the story was really enjoyable. It was well written, directed, shot and acted. Just the right amount of ogre for the fun of it. Fantastic.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Hilariously funny! My kids (11 and 9) continually repeat one-liners from it. This is the second time we've rented it.
B00EMAGCJM|2.0|Ok so I watched Miley the movement and have listened to the singles off the album and though I was skeptical at first, I decided to give Miley the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately my gut feeling was right. This album seems really forced, from her new sound to her new image. It all just feels like she's trying too hard. She mentioned in her documentary everything she does right now needs to be cool. Well you know whats not cool Miley trying to be cool and thats exactly what this album tries and fails to do. She tried to pull off the hiphop genre but it feel so insincere maybe because its not her. Its not as if she can't hold a note out of 16 tracks she did well on two and big suprise they were not hiphop influenced! Drive was nice and so was someone else in addition to the two singles she already has out, thats it though. In trying to discover a new sound she only found one thats doesnt fit. It sounds like kidz bop meets hiphop. Its time to go back to the drawing board and think of something else because this is not it boo!
B00190N4E4|4.0|I found the movie very informative. This showed Gandhi in a different light than that which was personified in the media. I really enjoyed the movie.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am one of those Constant Readers to whom King often refers. The Shining is a favorite and I was prepared to be disappointed. How could he capture the sheer creepiness, the malignancy portrayed in the first book? Well, he did and I still do not know how. Prepare yourself because this one will impart that classic spook that will stick with you and visit you in your dreams.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Enjoy the world and culture and the wardrobe and who is the world of a six month ago from web
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I hate it because you never know who is playing game it might be a six your old and you made the air hockey game to hard.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game because you can do anything you can do anything you want I saw herobrine in my<br />house and I killed him he drop 54 diamond's
B003G4W49C|5.0|I enjoyed it. I appreciate how it treats children like people who are simultaneously powerful and powerless. It had some darkness which kept it grounded, albeit in a fantasy.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|A great spin-off for the franchise! So mad it got cancelled! It deserved more recognition! It was well-written and directed!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Now im not a big trek fan, and i know this movie really isn't a Trek movie but more of a action movie with trek elements in it. The plot, well, yea whatever. Dont try to think so hard cause it will hurt. But its fun to watch<br /><br />I myself rip the 3D movie with DVDFab and convert it to a very high quality, i do this because my tv wont activate the correct 3D when i try to play from the bluray. The visuals are amazing, the 3d is very deep and looks great when cgi is in the mix.<br /><br />If you got a nice setup then yes get it
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I love Rainbow Rowell and I might love Fangirl even more than Eleanor & Park. Rowell is a master at creating characters unlike most of those that populate YA, be it a chubby redhead girl, a likeable Korean-American, or, in this case, an anxious, angsty fanfic writing teenager.<br /><br />Cath is one of the very few protagonists who aren't just awkward so that the author can make you laugh and so that the leading man can come rescue them. She's awkward because she is. She's not a people person, she lives in her head, and she only has one person she lets in: her twin, Wren. Rowell made Cath's growth gradual, it happened along the book thanks to Cath's interactions with the other colorful characters: Wren, her outgoing \\"prettier\\" twin with a penchant for drinking; Art, the twins' father who is caring but has issues; Reagan, her outspoken, upfront, funny roommate; and Levi, Reagan's best friend and all around good guy who happens to hang out in their dorm room all the time.<br /><br />The characters are so alive they pretty much jump off the pages and the writing is beautiful and engaging. The plot sometimes went a bit too slow and then too fast for my taste but overall it moved along nicely and wasn't cliched.<br /><br />The one thing I wish had gotten more time was Cath's relationship with her mother. But even that, I feel, was planned. In the end, there wasn't much more to say on that note even if, as a reader, you wished it were different.<br /><br />I really recommend this book to anyone who likes character driven stories and a unique voice in YA.
B005LAII80|5.0|Movie is OK for an action flick, 3D effects are pretty good. Price is pretty good for a 3D movie.​
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Adobe applications have a significant market share primarily due to their being the \\"default\\" application installed by most device manufacturers. Whether on the desktop or laptop computer or a smartphone or tablet, Adobe gets it grips into the market this way. Their applications (including this one) are buggy and lax on security. Anyone familiar with the constant updates to Adobe applications can testify to this.<br /><br />The Adobe Reader for Android is no exception. Bloated and buggy, it does a poor job of rendering PDF files. I highly recommend a more efficient and effective reader such as FoxIt Reader for Android.
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|My husband and I watched The Croods with our three young children and we all loved it! It is very hard for a grown man and a 3 year old girl to enjoy the same movie, but The Croods was up to the challenge. Being the sappy mom I am, there were definitely some tears spilled, but a great movie usually does that to me. We only rented it but I know that it will be under our Christmas tree this year.
B005TBN3EU|1.0|My wife and I both enjoyed the original movie, The Hangover. So we thought we would check out this sequel.<br /><br />Wow. I am familiar with the general principle that sequels are rarely as good as the original film, but this...this...this movie is unbelievably abysmal. About an hour into it, my wife asked me \\"Is this supposed to be funny?\\" The story is horrible, the acting is phoned in, and the \\"plot\\" is banal. Where the first movie had so many laugh out loud moments, Part II just limped along like a dog that had been run over by a car but survived. I cannot fathom the thought process of the executives who signed off on this, or the test audiences who found it anything less than painful to watch.<br /><br />I can honestly tell you I did not laugh once. Where the original was humorous, this sequel is just plain painful. The plot consists of Stu's impending nuptials in Thailand, a night that none of the friends can remember, a missing teenage boy, and one or two subplots that don't really ever come to fruition. The film is joyless and, at times, mean-spirited. Very sad.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've read most of Stephen King's books over the years.  I remember reading The Shining about 30 years ago while in study hall in high school and getting spooked reading about the ghost in the bathroom.  Fast forward to 2103 and now as a middle-aged reader I feel like I've gone full circle with this sequel.  From the moment I started it, I haven't been able to put it down.  I'm 85% done and I don't want it to end. I'll probably have to go back and re-read The Shining after this.  Mr. King never fails to amaze me with his writing and it's like his books have been my friends throughout my life.
B006MGDVFM|5.0|If you like F1 racing and the true to life rivalry in competitive sports, this movie brings it and more!!
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I will have to come back and read this every so often. I have already read this twice. Love it.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Just another movie that is okay.  Hero does everything right, and everyone is pretty much at his beckon call.  Good graphics and make-up.  I just was hoping for more emotion I guess.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|I loved the idea that the zeeks were so relentless. they moved like a tidal wave or like a swarm of bees. it was awesome!
B008220C38|5.0|I absolutely loved this &#34;version&#34; of the movie! Being a Tolstoy fan I can say I LOVED this &#34;view&#34; of the story.<br />I can understand some people not liking this concept, but the director has worked with the leads before; in my opinion they worked together very well.<br />The set was incredible, Keira was magnificient, I almost didn´t recognize Mathew!<br />Excellent job.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Sweet, funny, adorable. My daughter loves this movie. The main characters are witty and personable. I love the message it sends about beauty.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|It is dreamy because of the special effects with the lenses and all that.<br />It is dreamy because of a handsome Jay, a beautiful Daisy, a breathtaking mansion, and a doomed love affair are entangled to revive the 20´s in a rendition of the book as close as it can be made.<br />I loved the movie.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|I love this guy's style and love some of the songs.  I think Phillip held back a little or let someone else change the productions a little.  But I love it just the same.  There's a down-home truthful quality about his words and his delivery.

B008JFUUIA|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! I think I had already watched this at least 20 times (on my HBO movie channels) before I finally bought the DVD. I also really liked the extras on the DVD that had outtakes and other bonus material. Okay, time to go watch it again!
0375842209|5.0|Hi, I'm a 13 year old girl who's read this book about 4 times in the past year and it has never failed to make me cry, laugh, and make me think in the most wonderful ways. In a way, I believe this story makes me whole and I strongly believe that before everybody dies, they should read this book at least once before they pass.<br /> Where do I even begin? The book is narrated by death himself (some who only wears a black hoodie when it's cold, and looks like you.), although an interesting choice at first, it's was the right one. The main character is Liesel, a German girl with dangerous brown eyes but hair like honey. After a tragedy on the train occurs, Liesel is sent to live with foster parents only to never see her mom again. After a few stubborn night ps of not bathing, Liesel quickly learns of just how great her life will be with her accordionist papa, and her iron fisted woman of a mama. And...the rest is history (literally, although not fiction, it is set in the past-Holocaust era, aka WWll). Over the set of the years Leisel befriends several friends (young and old), specially Rudy- the lemon haired crazy kid, who painted himself in charcole for reasons. Oh Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy. How he will make you want that kiss more than anything. If you don't fall in love with that boy, well, get checked out. Anyway, through the years Leisel risks her life several times just for the precious words. and in the mist if it all, Max comes in. The fistfighing Jew who has hair like feathers and steals the sky.<br /> I wish I could say more, but I can't. Not without spoiling it anyway. What's do have to say is this: read it. Read it. Read it. Read it. And when you get to part 10 get the tissues out because, well, ahoy will cry. No mater how strong and macho you think you are. Because that is bull.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|Amazon was nice enough to include this as a gift when I purchased the DVD of The Breakfast Club (Flashback Edition). It was great to have this while I waited for the DVD to arrive.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book little complicated towards end but great highly recommend it to all friends and anyone who might want to read it
B00AEFYKCA|5.0|Christian Bale is such an amazing actor. I know he is eccentric, but honestly if he wasn't he would not be so great! Definitely recommend!!
B00000634J|5.0|This is a classic John Lennon CD with all of his greatest hits! Great music and interesting messages. I would highly recommend it!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|I love action and this movie delivered. With Robert being the ever sarcastic and witty hero was icing on the cake.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|For an app game I find this to be very entertaining. The game play is similar to Diablo or Torchlight. Take it from a computer gamer this game is fun. Who doesn't like killin' monsters and gettin' loot!?!:
B00000K0E5|5.0|Great movie, nothing else needs to be said, high quality product and enjoyable movie for 007 fans and non-fans alike.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Been using yahoo for years, will never move! Love it! Is where I started using Email and will continue for years to come. All my friends use it too.

B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This app is so addictive and fun. You will want to play it all the time. I love it and you will too.
B00DULWFZE|4.0|I was a big fan of BSB back in the late 90s/early 2000s when boy bands were big.  Their later albums (especially after some of the main members left) were not my favorite, but this album felt like I was back in the early 2000's again.
B005PK56TA|4.0|I watched Season 2 , Asylum and that was excellent (5 star), then I watched season one, Murder House and though it was very good, I wasn't completely satisfied with the ending like I was with Season 2.
B0046B4VXQ|5.0|Carrie has been wandering through the dark alleys of my mind since about the age of 10.  Yes 10.  It was the 70's.<br />For this type of impact I have to give 5 stars.<br /><br />I'll share of few of my reactions.  It's a mashup of genre's...coming of age, societal issues/abuse, disillusionment, sci-fi & horror -- if not more, including an intriguing and well-done, sort of soft porn quality intro of the girls locker room shower scene.  There are only a few distractions that seemingly date and distract -- the audio bits during lighter scenes evoke a 70's feel (early electronic music?), the odd quality voice in the voice over &#34;they're all gonna laugh at you (repeat x 100 and it b/cs annoying!)&#34;,  and the &#34;special effects&#34; at the end of the film.  Otherwise it's easy to yet again immerse yourself in this story.<br /><br />Every social group, especially in childhood, has that oddball that everyone rejects -- often cruelly and for no reason.  Rarely does anyone take time to appreciate the back story or context for the &#34;loser.&#34;  For Carrie, Stephen King gives us the insanely religious, abusive, psychotic mother.  This is the basic story line of that person's revenge or the effects of being &#34;pushed to far.&#34;  Unlike our current day, real-life, outcasts that riddle schools and other kids with bullets....Carrie has telekinesis, a psychic ability -- something that was emerging in the public consciousness with excitement, curiosity, and believability.  What's great about this story is that Carrie, despite the odds -- her evilly pious mother, her lack of social skills, her status as pariah -- starts to blossom....to take control of her life.  We cheer her on even though we know the train is about to fly off the rails -- yet we secretly hold hope that it won't.  After it does, after her crushing disillusionment with the possibility of normality, she turns back to her mother for comfort...who in turn offers the ultimate betrayal of a mother -- for aclimactic ending that's a double downer.  Well, Carrie's only response to this can be even more of a negation.  Not only can she not have a normal life...but no life, not even the tortured one of her mother's making.<br /><br />I tried to move a pencil with my mind for months after this movie....no luck.  A good thing I suppose...
B000ZMVAXO|3.0|Returned it for C-30. more of  clsc sound. it's  gret device, but unless you rly like hvy mtl, then get the C-30
B000JCQCW4|3.0|Moralizing diminishes characters to pawns in your morality tale.<br /><br />When characters b/c pawns you get yawns.<br /><br />There's no real choice or conflict...it's just a downhill slide. The strength of the film is the vitality, if you will, of this downhill slide toward fatality. You don't agonize over the characters choices b/c you know there is no choice for them....that they are there to fulfill a fixed role and there won't be any surprises. There's really nothing to hope for, not b/c they do drugs, but b/c there is no real conflict, no struggle in them...no sense of real choice on their part -- which is not like anyone I know. Addict or not, people are deeper than this portrayal and with no depth, we tune out and can't really relate.<br /><br />In fact, the story lines b/c trite and ludicrous --- which is necessary to keep our attention. Notice how you feel toward the characters at the end? Nothing. Maybe....maybe a twinge of pity. But that's it. Amputation? Oh well, shoulda had that looked at sooner.  G-B'd by Black men and Asian tourists? Hmm, you don't seem that upset. Institutionalized? Can you say melodrama? Imprisoned and missing Momma? Huh, sure, okay....who don't miss their momma in prison?<br /><br />We don't need a morality tale....we need a story that wrenches our hearts
1400069181|5.0|I sat down and read it cover-to-cover in one evening. Think I will go do something that makes the world an even better place!
B0037NVM2C|4.0|The more I think about this movie, the more I want to lower the stars given.  So maybe best not to think too much?<br /><br />Here are some of my annoyances:  Forced Sentimentality -- in the relationship b/t the mother and son and b/t the Terminator (Arnold) and the boy.  It felt forced and a bit silly.  Will the mother show her love for the son or just be this hard-a$$ed Biatsch?  Can a terminator be more like a human than a machine....like a father?  No problemo.  He'll even salute you as he martyrs himself.<br />The repeated dream sequence of a nuclear holocaust blasting a playground.  Idk, it just got old and tiresome.<br /><br />The obvious plot busters:  He's missing an arm NOW, its stuck in the machine over there....and you throw the arm from the past into the molten steel to destroy it....but that's just one arm...there are two arms!  Go get the other ARM.  That's you're whole purpose, to destroy the materials that can later be used to build skynet...and you forget the other arm?  The fate of the world, the impending nuclear crispi-fication of the innocent kids on that little playground, it all hinges on you suddenly forgetting that there are TWO arms.<br /><br />Oh well...I like the chase scene where Arnold flips the sawed-off shot gun round and round to reload it.  That was cool.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Like the other Fire Maple games, Mosaika has beautiful graphics, soothing music and puzzles that are neither too difficult nor too easy. It is a short game, but for $.99 you shouldn't expect days of game play. One word of caution, be careful how you use the hints; you can eventually solve the puzzles without them, but if you use the hints it will make the game much shorter. The hints basically tell you exactly what to do.
B00FJTYDKK|2.0|The movie is the normal cliche girl meets boy/ overprotective father etc.  The story was very thin and predictable.  My three kids 5, 6, and 8 were only mildly entertained
B009XIXVU6|2.0|The mountains echoed<br /><br /> Very disappointed with this book. We had it loaded on our two kindles. Read his first two books and really enjoyed his writing. Cannot believe that so many 5 stars.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|This app is so smooth and so fun. The gameplay is really enjoyable and it never gets boring. I think it's my best game on my android phone.
B005UG542S|5.0|I rented this movie to watch, I was very pleased that is was available, I find more movies on Amazon than Netflix.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I love kik, but I had to delete it and now it won't let me back on! It says it's taking too long, someone, fix this bug, please!
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|Cool album - arabella is my favorite. Don't know whether I like the Helder back up vocals are not, but they definitely make for a differently colored album.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I love this series! Although strict academics would argue about historical accuracies, the show is great. I hope that people who otherwise wouldn't be interested in History will get hooked on this. Kudos, History Channel. For your Bible Series too.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|this book was mesmerizing.  From start to finish I could hardly put it down.  Very thought provoking.  Great for a book club. The characters were very interesting, each one.  I would recommend this book highly.
B002O3Z50G|5.0|I have always love to watch Twister when it was on TV.  Now I can watch it whenever I want.
B00594XOZU|1.0|The app was working great until it logged me out and wouldn't let me back in. It said the log in was taking too long and then it voided the request. Please fix!!! I want to kik my friends again!!!
B001KZG99A|5.0|Robert Downey, wild eyes and smart alec grin always make me want to watch more and keep watching. Good storyline, great acting.
1475972350|1.0|I was a sucker to buy this book based on the number of positive ratings.  I question whether the author is an adult.  The writing style is immature and the characters relate to situations and each other in a juvenile manner, as though the author does not have enough life experience to draw them.  If this weren't enough to earn this book the lowest possible rating, the story barely holds water and is full of distracting typos.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|He delivers an excellent performance as is expected. Storyline is great and marvel continues to rock. This is worth a watch maybe two.
B00FN811SY|1.0|Unable to install app on my kindle fire tablet.  Amazon.com told me this app is not compatable for my tablet.  I am so very dissapointed.  I have the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures installed already on this devise.  How sad the revised edition is not available for my one year old tablet.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very cute little game on Kindle that is fun for both me and my 8 year old son to play.  Addictive.  Much better than some of the games I've purchased.
1609611543|5.0|Important information for everyone who suffers with a hoard of gastrointestinal symptoms and even beyond. Education of this form is so important if you want to take back your &#34;health&#34;.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was chosen for a book club so I didn't pick it, but I did enjoy it.<br />Story lines easy to follow
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lots a great game and it would be a great game for kids to learn how to play so they can take care of there own animal
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I read the critics comments about this man's music. And even Pavarotti made his comments when Bocelli began his career. And now look, Bocelli has reached the soul of every person who has truly LISTENED to the passion in his voice and have grown to love his music. It has a stirring effect of ones inner most feelings of passion and love. Peacefulness and joy, I feel, when I listen to this touching voice. I find Bocelli's music to be soothing and comforting, takes me to another place far away.....Italy. BUY IT! You won't be disappointed!
B006QPX7UI|5.0|Just visited Gettysburg last week, now I wish we had seen this video before going. If you want to know more about our history, this is a movie to watch
B008XKSW7M|2.0|There was no plot and overall not funny. CHEEZY to say the least. I would not watch it again .
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun way to pass time while waiting at Docs office. Time really flies.good graphics and easy to play. Great on my Kindle Fire HD.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a simple yet engaging app that is basically connecting the color dots without crossing the streams.  There is a variety of board sizes and about 180 levels for each board size so there is no shortage of play time.  It makes you think about how you can work the streams to minimize the moves, which is great for the brain.  I can only take about 10-15 levels before I get tired of it, but I do keep going back.
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|This wonderful book is very sad and happy at the same time. If the author is reading this please make a third Land Of Stories. I would really like to read it.<br />  -10 year old
B0085YNML2|5.0|Love this game - it's so fun to play.  It's basically an iguana that you direct by tapping the screen that flies around the screen using it's tongue to spin and whirl with flowers that have different rules of using.  Each level is a bit more challenging but not impossible and there are tons of levels and environments.  The graphics are amazing and it loads pretty fast.  Occasionally I'll get a glitch with loading, but other than that I've never had any problem.  It is annoying that you have to be logged in with Amazon to play though.  Otherwise, it's a great way to pass the time when waiting in line.
B00498XRPE|5.0|Wanted to see this movie before seeing Prometheus to get a better understanding of it. I actully liked this movie more than Prometheus.

B0063M22QO|4.0|Easy to learn ,yet has progressive challenges.  I find that I can play this and not get tense or crazy. It's fun .
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I down loaded, but it wanted continuous internet connection; otherwise it is not working, Hence I removed it.<br />It seems it is not offline game.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|This is handy and it fits my kindle fine (I have kindle paperwhite) but I feel like it is bigger than necessary - there is excess space around the Kindle and it could be made smaller and more compact and still fit the kindle. But I like the material and it is light and pretty.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very entertaining and it is fun to play when you are bored ....so if u haven't already u should download this game NOW
B0014BY72Q|4.0|Ustinov is especially great in this mildly campy but still entertaining post-apocalyptic film. It's a probably 20 minutes longer than it should be, I suppose, but is otherwise fun.

B000MD9UJC|5.0|One of my mini Mag-Lites was damaged by battery leakage on the spring and would no longer power on.  I purchased the Nite Ize not only for the LED feature but also to replace the bottom cap assembly.  This solution was less expensive than purchasing the OEM part, and gave me a much brighter flashlight as well!<br /><br />Installing the bulb consists of unscrewing the head of the flashlight, pulling out the bulb and conical reflector and replacing these items with the new parts.  It's important to note that the freely turning base disk that holds the original bulb does not come out (it even says \\"do not remove\\"), even though the new LED comes with its own similar-looking disc.  I mistakenly thought that the new disk would replace the old one, but unfortunately it doesn't work this way; the new disk, with the LED embedded into it, presses into the old disk and thus the bulb assembly is now about 2mm longer than before.  If it doesn't work at first, you need to pull it out again and reverse the position to reverse the polarity; you have a 50% chance of getting it right the first time.  Then you replace the head of the flashlight and screw it on as much as it allows, which you should be aware is less than before.<br /><br />To turn on the flashlight, you either use the new button on the base or the regular twist-on switch.  I love the button because it allows me to switch on the flashlight with one hand, convenient when my other hand is holding a screwdriver or whatever.  Others have noted that the button seems flimsy.  I've only had this unit a few days so cannot comment on its long term serviceability but for now it works great.<br /><br />If you store your new, improved Mag Mini in your glove compartment, I would recommend twisting it off, because the button is fairly sensitive and it might switch on while bouncing and rolling around.<br /><br />The LED makes the flashlight brighter than before, but not quite as bright as a regular LED Mag Mini.  Is it worth the money?  I think so.  Some of these cheaper LED flashlights seem to die after a few weeks of use, whereas the Mags just keep on working (until the battery leaks).
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|For me, Iron Man 3 has been one of the better action films to come out this year.  I was much more impressed with it than the new GI Joe and Die Hard movies.  It held my attention, the story was easy to follow, and I like the fact that the plot line is staying in tact and being woven across all of the Avengers characters, movies, and shows (Avengers, Iron Man 3, & Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.).
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This was an easy read but by no means light. I haven't done the exercises yet, but expect positive results. Highly recommended!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|This book places the acceptance of introversion in historical perspective, from cultural through scientific and even a little bit of religion.  It allows the introvert (me) to better understand herself, her natural interactions, and the interactions she see her grandchildren making (all introverts except one).  What an interesting book!
B006LSZECO|3.0|This one was on the best seller list so long I read it to see why.  All I can figure is there's a lot of women who like reading about how insensitive some men can be.  That's what the first half of the book is about.  The second half is about how devious some women can be.  The only mystery was how Flynn would resolve the two.  Telling alternate parts of the story using Amy's diary is an interesting device; and the underlying theme of the futility of trying to be who we are expected to be instead of who we are earned an extra star.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|At 16 with this much talent, she's going to be around for a long time. Her voice is like molasses.
B001EBV0OY|1.0|While the film may have some redeeming value, there is too much slime to get through to wait to find out.  I've visited many prisons and the language in the movie is totally over the top up and unnecessary.
0143119680|5.0|Diana Bishop is a historian, and is presently working in Oxford's Bodleian Library.  She calls up a manuscript on which a spell has been cast, and unknowingly breaks the spell.  She sends the book back to the archives, and at first doesn't realize that she has captured the attention of several supernatural creatures who have been trying to get the book for centuries.  While Diana is a witch, she has purposely tried to avoid using witchcraft and has been in denial about her heritage and her magical powers.  In a world where witches, vampires, and daemons live among humans, Diana meets a vampire, Matthew Clairmont.  There is a rule that witches cannot associate with vampires, but they fall in love in spite of the rule.  It is, however, a strange relationship, where both are actually a danger to each other with their individual powers.  Such is the premise of the first installment of the All Souls Trilogy, A Discovery of Witches.<br /><br />Harkness is a master at characterization, and readers will feel like the characters are real persons; some may even believe the creatures exist.  Although this is a fantasy thriller, with Harkness' excellent writing, this book could almost be mistaken for a memoir, and it almost seems plausible.  The book is difficult to put down, and the suspense seems to build throughout the entire novel as Diana, Matthew, et al go through regular life happenings, like traveling to meet Matthew's mother, and staying with Diana's Aunts (her parents were murdered when she was seven years old).  There are attempts on Diana's and Matthew's lives, and most readers will be on the edge of their seats as the suspense builds.  The characters are likeable too, at least the good ones; the evil ones are easy to hate, and as Diana learns to use her magic, readers will find themselves delighted when she is successful and very disappointed when she isn't.  I found it charming when she admitted that she had never cooked for a vampire, and found herself doing research on what to feed Matthew when he was invited to dinner.<br /><br />No book is perfect, and I found it a bit puzzling that Matthew and Diana were constantly making each other angry with comments they made; most seemed a bit benign to me, and I had trouble understanding why they generated so much anger.  All in all, however, A Discovery of Witches is highly recommended for anyone who loves a good thriller with unique characters and a bit of fantasy.  This is a book that won't be put down, and waiting for the next installment will take plenty of patience.  It is no wonder that the book is a #1 New York Times Bestseller.<br /><br />This book was purchased with personal funds and no promotion of the book was solicited by the author or publisher.arch on what to feed Matthew when he was invited to dinner.<br /><br />No book is perfect, and I found it a bit puzzling that Matthew and Diana were constantly making each other angry with comments they made; most seemed a bit benign to me, and I had trouble understanding why they generated so much anger.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It does everything, we were told  it would do. Everything on the computer,<br />could be cast to the Tv. To get into more detail is not possible, our Tv is in<br />The shop with a back light issue.
B005QYKD4I|3.0|Transformers has seemed to have transformed from a genre aimed at children to adults or pseudo adults. It was hard for the fourteen year old to watch for the fact of the strong language and sexual content. So, if you tire of listening to the f-bomb you might just want to utilize the &#34;MUTE&#34; option.<br /><br />I think that it was unfortunate that the producers felt they need to rely on elevating the rating level with this content to sell the product.<br /><br />Otherwise, the FX is outstanding as in previous, and the main storyline stands with the ideals of Transformers.
0446693804|5.0|Oh my gosh! this is the sweetest book! I watched the movie before i read the book, and i thought i wasnt going to like the book, but i loooove it! Would recommend!

I tried uninstalling the app, rebooting the phone, and reinstalling the app--not working! I have tried every day, but have only gotten more frustration. Your rep I talked with decided to update my phone OS to ice cream sandwich, but that doesn't solve the problem for other reviewers, so I'm not going to try it. Everything was fine UNTIL you decided to FIX IT.<br />Just imagine my surprise today when I discovered my Android Kindle app had done another auto-update---AND IT WORKS NOW.  Thank you for version 4.2.0.101 on 10-15-2013.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Enigmatis - Great story line. I love first person POV.  Just the right combination of point and click and HOG.  One of the very few games out there you can come back to and play again. Enigmatis is long enough and difficult enough to hold your interest.
B008Y212PI|4.0|The easy puzzles are really easy and go fast. Then the harder levels make you think. Great brain work out.  I like how you only get 3 misses and then you have to start over. Would lime more puzzle s though.
B007T2XC7A|2.0|Love Norah's vocals and style on past efforts, but this departure from her norm, while a bold effort, fails to impress.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This is a movie that you either love it or hate it.  I for one loved it, and we have watched it multiple times right as soon as it is over.  It is definitely one that you have to have the right sense of humor.  Definitely like I said love or hate.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Of all the Star Trek movies this one is my favorite . The story line was great . I wish I could say that I have a favorite character but I loved them all .
B000065V42|5.0|Loved this movie growing up, and haven't seen it for years.  We watched it and I still love it as much then as I do now.  My 7 yo loved it too, except for the ant part, but she got over it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Absolutely love it! Perfect way to get netflix on TV w/o tying up a computer, we control from our phones and kids can see their favorite shows
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|It's hyper-violent, so you want to keep this away from the kids. The imagery is stunning, there's not much backstory with the main character, but you tend to look past that with the main storyline: which is a sort of &#34;Training Day&#34; meets &#34;Raid: Redemption&#34;. Karl Urban is a brave soul in the title role since he does not remove the helmet once in the film, staying true to the comic. If your looking for an Oscar worthy film, this isn't it, but sci-fi flicks have their own type of energy that keeps them on the shelf long after many critically lauded films (Ordinary Lives vs the Fifth Element!).
B002VPE1XY|5.0|perfect I love this case but the only thing no storage for battery  but its ok for me very happy for the product
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like this app as I have it on all my devices. I thick they should update this app to be a little like the iPhone version as it is easier to use.
B008AIGWVA|2.0|I'm not saying I don't like it I'm just saying it's not that fun that's all I had to say thank you for your time
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|This version of The Great Gatsby catches the depth of Gatsby character, the many moods and shifts that make him what he is..basically a kind of charlatan and a person who wants the American Dream to come true for him and for Daisy. It cannot come true and she is ultimately relegated to the discard pile, while Gatsby must atone for things another person did, all very messy and a part of the one-dimensional life he seeks to escape at every turn. Gatsby, as DECaprio plays him, is enigmatic but finally deep at the surface only, and his is America.<br /><br />Visually stunning with music that propells the action into the depths of the 20s and at the same time takes us into the present which is passing away as quickly as a glass of champagne, as quickly as fortunes will disappear at the end of the 20s. Already, as the film opens, Gatsby is obsolete.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio once more gives a stellar performance. He is that kind of actor who is a genuine artist with his timing, gestures, facial expressions, intonations of voice,those quick steps,sharp-eyed glances, and surprise and shock that everything must end, for him apocalyptically.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is flawless, especially Daisy ( Elizabeth Debicki) and Tobey McGuire. McGuire very subtley suggests the sexual ambiguity that he posseses along with Gatsby's own mysterious attachment to him, never defined, never acknowleged, but there, a sensuality that is absolutely brillaint the way it comes across.<br /><br />Daisy is at first all shine and glitter and very little substance, but then she suddenly exudes charm and guilesness and purpose. Her \\"death\\" will be one by 1000 cuts at the hands of her thug of a husband. It is all very well done..one magnificent scene after another.<br /><br /> Those who are bored with films like this usually go to computer-driven action films about the earth ending or about the iron-clad heros beating up everyone they encounter all done with tricks..but the bad acting! Thesepeople who are not into serious cinema cannot be paid attention to in any venue they may choose to criticize a film, for they are finally without a knowlege of the art of film. Leave them to their own devices.<br /><br />Buy this film and rejoice!
B000QZTK28|5.0|Rediculous musicianship. The skill level of the players on this album is second to none. Mike Watt is a force to be heard and felt on bass. D. Boone (R.I.P.) is as unique and talented a guitar player as anyone from his time. In my opinion, to call this a punk rock album would be incorrect. Even though the lyrics may be political in nature on most tracks, this album spans many generes of rock and roll. These guys were creators and innovators that would be immitated for years after this album, and for several years to come. This is a must have album for even the most critical music fan. The songs are short and sweet and to the point. Did I mention the drums? Tight and right. No long solos, no double bass, just straight jam. I am proud to say it is in my archive.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|The book is all over the place - I am still trying to make sense of it.  I really enjoyed the author's books the Kite Runner and a Thousand Splendid Suns and thought this would be written in similar fashion - not so.
B0002V7O3I|5.0|This DVD is excellent (region 1, NTSC, 16 by 9 enhanced) and is the best the film has ever looked or sounded on home video.  I have watched this dozens of times and it remains one of my all time favorites.  This cries out for a Blu-ray release (I hope you are listening, Paramount or Warner).  And to top it off, that wonderful ending of the kids flying ALWAYS makes me feel great.  I very highly recommend this film.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The ending was a little abrupt after what happened in the other books, but all in wall it wasn't a bad read.
B0000C23DO|5.0|I own both CDs.  \\"Skeletons\\" I bought probably 10+ years ago and \\"Very best\\" just this year.  I was just too lazy to burn a CD from the G.D. songs I had on my computer plus the Amazon auto-rip service puts this right in my cloud player to listen to on my work computer.  This greatest hits version is the one to buy.  More songs, but curiously doesn't include \\"Turn on your love light\\" which is a highlight from \\"Skeletons\\".
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|They continue to amaze. I am always pleasantly surprised by the endless quality of their recordings. True musicians, fantastic vocals and lyrics.  They never disappoint and this CD just builds upon their impressive music library!
159562015X|4.0|I like the basic philosophy that we should focus on our strengths, and spend a whole lot less time trying to fix our weaknesses.  So true. This is a book derived from years of work by the Gallup Corp (the consulting group, not the polling folks) as to how to classify an individual's strengths.  That is done via an online tool (access code is included) which then provides your top 5 strengths and detailed descriptions.<br /><br />I found I needed to review ALL of the strengths, and not just the top five that were provided by the online tool.  I found several that I thought were very applicable to me, in addition to those five.  My friends and family ALL AGREED that the top five were indeed my key strengths.  So there's that validation.<br /><br />If you're looking for &#34;what is the next step in my life&#34;, this book and the StrengthsFinder assessment is a key step.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|we upgraded to a blu ray player w internet access, much better to view on a entertainment screen vs laptop.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Every Stephen King element rolled up and twisted into a story that left me breathless...and that was still with 30% left to read.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Love all the Ironman movies!  They have done a great job making these movies family friendly without being completely cheesy.
1594746036|5.0|The photos in the book are worth the price and you get a riveting story as a bonus. We are eagerly awaiting the next book in this series.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I am a huge fan Myst &amp; Riven. This game is so addicting I couldn't stop playing it! I can't wait for the next chapter!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote helps me to keep with things under control! I have been using it at least for 3 pasted years.
B0031RDVNM|4.0|Exceptionally high level of courage , working together and strategic mind could win even some times impossible situations. It was very interesting reading
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My two year old daughter loved this movie. It was a cute movie to watch together as a family on a cold Saturday night.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|Not sure what to say. They play, they shipped fast, they are what they are. I introduced my daughter to starwars and she likes it.
030758836X|4.0|The book starts slowly, and I wondered why friends had recommended it to me.  However, by page 100 I was hooked.  What great character development, and the relationship between husband and wife went beyond where my imagination had ever gone.  A must read.
B009SKPVO8|4.0|The strap that came with my Nikon D5100 was not the best option for me.  It just wasn't long enough to comfortably use it as a sling, rather than wearing straight over my neck (which I didn't care for).  After purchasing this strap, I can now sling the strap around me and have the camera fall perfectly at my hip.  This convenience/improvement in comfort is a game changer; times that I would have left my camera behind because it would be a pain to carry with the old strap, I now go ahead and bring it with me, since even if I don't use it, at least I didn't suffer carrying it the old way.<br /><br />I do agree that the pad could use a little tacky material to keep it from sliding, although that hasn't been a major negative up to this point, just a minor annoyance.  I think the quality of this strap and the connector are pretty good.  There are probably higher quality sling straps out there, but for less than $20 I'd say this is a really solid option.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I suppose you could call this the historical fiction version of the Kardashians, but I think it is a great period piece. It gives you a feel for a previous era and economy. Sometimes you wonder what else could go wrong, but there are plenty of happy parts as well.
B0055QYKQO|1.0|I purchased this board for my first system build. Alongside it, I installed an AMD Phenom II X6 3.3 ghz processor, 4x4 gigabytes of Corsair Vengeance DDR3 Ram, a 750w PSU, DVD/CD optical drive, Blu-Ray optical drive, and Western Digital Velociraptor 10000 rpm hard drive.<br /><br />I've had multiple issues with the motherboard from the beginning. At first it was due to memory errors. I had multiple blue screens of death, different error messages each time, they were so bad, that I had to remove 3 of the 4 sticks of RAM just so that it wouldn't crash. Later on, my Blu-Ray drive stopped functioning, and now my motherboard overheats. The heatsink that rests over the northbridge is running super hot. I'd say it's at least 110, when normal operating temperature should max out at 95 according to the specs. I don't overclock my unit, so it's not that. I flashed BIOS to see if that would help resolve the issue, and nothing happened.  I checked the specs in BIOS to make sure that the frequency wasn't too high, and it's at the preloaded defaults of 2000mhz.<br /><br />From my experience: don't buy this board. All these issues happened within less than six months.<br /><br />I don't plan on buying another gigabyte product, and I'm getting an Asus board in the next two weeks to replace this junk.
B0032UYFA6|4.0|I'm not real fond of TV show seasons ending with a real cliff hanger like this one did, forcing people to wait months to see what happened.  However, I was able to find the first episode of the next season and watch it within a week.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't imagine a better book than this one.. it's intriguing and there's so many things you would never expect to happen.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great book, fun read and excising twists. Take a look if you enjoy mystery and fantasy novels, it will blow your mind!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Just a well written book. I really enjoy a lot of these types of books Stephen King writes. If you haven't read this one do so.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Loved loved loved this book. I began seeing the experiments manifesting immediately. I will def be reading this book time and time again.
B009LDD22U|5.0|This show just seems to be getting better as the seasons continue! I highly recommend this show to anyone who enjoys comedies!
0525953728|5.0|It arrived in perfect condition and quickly.  My brother-in-law said the book was a very good read.  He is in the military and enjoyed<br />the story line.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Good, just good. The should of used his suit more..but all in all it was still ok ok ok ok
B0068TL23G|5.0|My favorite game so far.  It's fun, but it doesn't make me feel like I'm wasting my time because it excercises my brain -- but not so much that it gives me a headache.  It's very enjoyable, but not so addictive that I can't put it down -- I can always start up again exactly where I left off.  It's great for something to do in a quiet waiting room, or while the kids are having music lessons because the sound effects aren't critical to enjoying the game.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I loved it because it was a new writer from a different country and the setting is Austrialia and the secret isn't what you'd expect at all-It was a quick read!
B0091WAWTM|1.0|There's an abundance of awkward nudity and camera angles throughout the film. However, the scenery of the landscape and country side is quite beautiful. There is an amazing opportunity to remake this movie in two different ways: stay true to the &#34;scary-ness&#34; with more subtlety to leave things to the imagination or make a parody of it. I have not seen the Nicholas Cage version and don't plan to.
B00CG5MVD6|4.0|A delightful movie  Be prepared to laugh.  The characters get you right from the beginning. Just weird enough.  It's worth the time.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Fresh, contemporary, very entertaining, good casting - good series to wind down after work. (One does not want to scrutinize the plot too much - just enjoy the characters and their dialogues.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Granddaughter will play for hours is I let them. When they ear a new prize the jump for joy with delight.
B00124PXW8|5.0|This continues to be the scariest movie I've ever seen. I believe it's due to the excellent character development and great story line - it helps me relate to the characters.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I have loved anything to do with star trek, and this one was another great one for me, I think the whole thing just clicked with me, if show both side of the con so to speak.  There is always two side to a person and don't judge on what you don't know.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I downloaded this app on a whim because I was bored and wanted a unique game to play. I was not disappointed.  There are plenty of puzzles to occupy your time ranging in difficulty from easy to diabolical.  My only complaint is that the background music that plays while you are on the menu screen does not play while you are solving a puzzle.  Not enough to subtract a star, just an observation.<br /><br />Overall, this is a delightful game and well worth it.
B00EYKRI1Q|4.0|What memories this one brought back. I was living abroad when the Clash hit the scene. I remember going to clubs enjoying the edgy sound.
0385344228|5.0|If you haven't read this book yet, you need to! It is an awesome book and I can imagine it happening in real life. And the author author answered my question about whether Jacob was guilty or not. :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not predictable.  So much tension and drama.  So worth the time to read and soak in. Would recommend to anyone
B00DWHWOFC|4.0|I don't remember how I became aware of this app, but I am THRILLED that I found it!  The object of the game is simple paint squares using the clues provided  &amp; watch as pictures appear.  I have purchased several add on packs &amp; can tell you that the import is seamless &amp; automatic.  The app runs perfectly on my Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />The one complaint I have (&amp;what keeps me from giving 4 stars) is that some of the puzzles don't open properly. I will be addressing  this issue with graphilogic soon.<br /><br />Buy this game.  You won't be sorry.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|If anyone is to assess the quality of the album, the rating will definitely be 5/5. Unfortunately, the scathing reviews of Bangerz are solely based on hatred of her current lifestyle. This album is great
B003G4W49C|5.0|The best book I have ever read I recommend this book a 100 times over if anyone is thinking of reading do it.
1400032717|5.0|It as new, just like they said. I would recommend these guys to anyone. They were very fast too. Good job.

B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My kids especially loved this learning game.<br />The puzzles, building the letters the dancing crabs all kept them so focused.<br />The sound effects are also calming, bubbling fish tank.<br />Its really great to see quality learning tools made that the kids actually want to play.<br />I have bought quite a few 2 2 learn applications for my kids.  I think they are all exceptional; they create<br />positive learning experiences, with praise for a task completed correctly, engaging graphics and sounds,<br />so many options and lvls to learn. WEll DONE!..And we look forward to more of your superior learning tools.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|It is a nice aplication. Did what I needed.Nothing out ofrece the extraordinary. Take punto account it is a free.
B00EDPFJA4|1.0|When I ordered this CD I thought that I was going to get Drakes latest album. What I got instead was a burned copy of it. I was so disappointed and I never would have order it through this company if I would have known what I was actually getting. I could have borrowed my friends and burned it myself for free.
6310292196|5.0|The Blu-ray edition really brings out the colors and beauty of the English countryside, estates, and mansions.  The ballroom scene in particular is fantastic.  Worth adding to your collection, I think.  However, main drawback is that is does not have the commentary track by Emma Thompson, so don't get rid of your dvd version.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|This book is very well written and researched. I couldn't put it down, but when I finally did I couldn't go to sleep either. This is a must read but not late at night.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|While I'm eagerly waiting for 3rd parties to expand Chromecast's functionality, the Netflix integration alone has made it worth it.  The device couldn't be simpler to use.  Well worth the money for Netflix alone, and with the recent addition of Hulu and more to follow it will only get better.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I use this one daily and it gives a good overall report of where I live in and the surrounding area.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|that I've ever seen. They moved like a virus invading a human body, quickly over running everything in sight. And the movie moves at the same pace. It is a sprint from start to finish.<br />The subplot is Gerry's relationship to his wife and 2 daughters and their personal struggle to come to grips with his return to service with the UN. Gerry is a sympathetic character pressed into a position that he doesn't want by the situation at hand. He rises to the occasion and confronts his fears, himself and zombies at every turn.<br />The larger plot of the 'war&#34; is explosive literally and figuratively; from the small scale individual battles with zombies to the larger scale decimation of cities. The move from actors as zombies to the mass of cg zombies was seamless. The feeling of panic was palpable and the thought of coming face to face with one of these zombies was terrifying.<br />The lack of typical zombie gore was not missed in the edge of your seat action and terror of a zombie apocalypse.<br />My inner geek longs for more exposition of the hows and whys of the plague; hopefully those will come in the sequel.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|I loved the best concert to enjoy from the bigining to the end...to much things to see eveything change dancers great...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this book in 3 days, with work during the daytime, so I would say its an entretaining read, it has a lot of nice phrases, and like everyone has warned you, you will probably cry, I would definately recommend it, i enjoyed John Green's writing, I would try another one of his books.
B004LWZDU0|5.0|My baby loves this movie. It plays perfectly. I bought it used but haven't had any problems with this DVD.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I would describe this movie as Blood Diamond with zombies.  Lots of action. Good acting and a simple and to the point plot.  Check it out!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Had a hard time at the start trying to figure out how this was going to be about the Orphan Train,but stick with it because it is, and it gives a wonderful look into a rarely discussed part of  American history.  Found it hard at first to relate to the angry and disaffected teenager Molly, but her special relationship with Vivian, 91 yr old Orphan Train survivor, forges life affirming changes in both of them.  Delightful read with a satisfying ending.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Great app, play often, I'm bad so it kicks my butt all of the time.  I'm hoping to get better thru playing vs this devil.  Recommended.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book is an inspiration for women, also those who are successful but want to achieve more.<br />Men might find this interesting too, my partner enjoyed the things I read out to him :).

B00EO10M54|1.0|Two songs released already are good......and that's about it. The rest is awful.  One of the worst CDs I've heard in a long time.
B00EMJD6TC|3.0|No real depth or fear in this movie.  Average plot, no really something I would watch multiple times.  Worth a rental not a purchase.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I used the recommendation to read &#34;the man who folded himself&#34; - but Stephen king does it well - I'm sure this writer (which I only saw the films based on his books) is a good thriller writer - but this book has its strength mainly because it’s written well. The period when the USA started really work its freedom. I seem to know the era even though I wasn't born.

B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this book - true historical fiction.  I had known of orphan trains because the mother of a friend of mine was on one!  But it is a little known part of American history.  The story is well told through an interesting relationship between a current orphan and an orphan who was on the train.  The story of the orphans' plights has stuck with me for a long time.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|Enders Game works on the visual interpretations of the game - Violence is surprising but some moments when you realize things you didn't expect. Good Book

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast is a great product if you know what you are getting. We have a Samsung TV (flatscreen, but no smart TV). We used our Blue-Ray player to stream Netflix movies. However, the Blue-Ray player took ages to open the Netflix app and navigating in Netflix was horrible and slow. The Blue-Ray player was connected to the router through ethernet, so it was not a connection problem.<br /><br />The Chromecast solved this for us. We use it mainly to make our TV a little smarter. Mostly, we watch Netflix and every now and then we watch some YouTube videos through it. I also tried the Google Play Music function, which works nicely for me, the same goes for Hulu Plus. The app selection is very limited at the moment. However, it is a product that is very much in its infancy, so I am expecting more apps to become available soon (-ish). I am really hoping that Amazon will make its Prime Instant Movies available through the Chromecast at some point. NHL Gamecenter and HBO Go would also be nice.<br /><br />Setting up the Chromecast was rather easy for me. Make sure you do have a reliable wifi connection, because the phone/tablet and the Chromecast need to communicate over Wifi. Also, the Chromecast will create its own little Wifi hotspot for a short time, so make sure you are rather close to the TV while setting up, so the Chromecast and the phone/tablet can communicate with each other.<br /><br />I hope the Chromecast technology will make its way into more products in the future. I would definitely get a soundbar/music system that would let me stream my music (plus Pandora, Rdio etc.) directly to a set of speakers, kind of like a Sonos, just cheaper and super easy to set up.<br /><br />I would recommend the Chromecast to people who want to upgrade their \\"dumb\\" TV or to people who purchase most their digital media from the Google Play Store.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|What can I say - this book is American - it’s written like a script of a movie that must be made. Keeps you focused, reading fast. EXCELLENT writing.
0399215921|2.0|Great book but I wish the product clearly advertised that it is a mini version. I couldn't use it for the preschool group I taught because it was so small.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|It is thriller from start  to finish. You know Mickey Haller will bend the law but always stays lawful. Michael Connelly does not fill up pages with &#34;fluff&#34;, he just tells the story and that is what I like.  B.J. Overton
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it so much fun my son loves playing it and started eating bananas because of this game. that is all
B008JFUORW|3.0|Hang 3 was definitely softer than the other 2 films. I saw it as a moody drama really. It did have some good bits but there could've been more jokes at many scenes. \\"This Is The End\\" had jokes on top of jokes where this one was more tame. More about the plot of Chow. You could tell Cooper was holding back for some reason, maybe they wanted his character to be more mature. I think the filmmakers wanted to cut back since everyone slammed part 2 for being so similar. But like most 3rd installments in movies, this had to be different. The finale was bittersweet I guess as it will be the last. But know, there's more story than humor. I was hoping for more inspired laughs.
B0083ZBW2Y|3.0|Too hard to follow along with and kinda confusing also very hard to read with a school to follow along
B004SBQGHS|2.0|This is only free of external ads.  They have ads for their own software everywhere on this in between games.  Really deceptive and frustrating!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book flows effortlessly with unforced imagery.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the well written story.

If you then continued to tell me that the pair would actually be portraying Liberace and his young lover, I probably would have continued to laugh in your face. Now, don't get me wrong, both actors are more than capable performers, but the odd pairing just doesn't scream &#34;captivating chemistry.&#34; Well, it turns out that such an assumption from me would have been dead wrong, and now we have the proof. I mean, just look at that the beautiful Region B/2 Blu-ray embossed cover!<br /><br />Directed by Steven Soderbergh of 'Behind the Candelabra' presents an intimate, funny, and genuinely dramatic peek into the colourful pianist's personal life, exposing a romance that starts off innocent enough but soon becomes increasingly chaotic, twisted, and unhealthy. As passion transitions into spite, and affection transforms into jealousy, the two tormented lovers engage in a roller coaster ride of emotions, all set against the backdrop of the over-the-top glitz and glamour of showbiz wealth and fame.<br /><br />Based on the 1988 memoir &#34;Behind the Candelabra: My Life with Liberace,&#34; the film focuses on the real-life relationship between Scott Thorson [Matt Damon], a young aspiring veterinarian, and an aging Liberace [Michael Douglas], the flashy superstar pianist. After being introduced to each other backstage at one of the musician's shows, the two instantly take a liking toward one another, and soon Liberace hires Scott to be his personal assistant. Their relationship then quickly becomes romantic, but things ultimately start to take a darker turn. As plastic surgery, drugs, and jealousy take hold, their coupling becomes damaging, threatening to unravel both their lives.<br /><br />The story is essentially told from Scott Thorson's perspective, and he serves as our window into Liberace's lavish world. At first overwhelmed by the flashy entertainer's extravagant lifestyle, the once modest and innocent young man eventually comes to embrace the many perks that come his way. In fact, he ultimately goes a little too far, and Matt Damon does a great job with the stark transformation, gradually shifting the character's personality until he's barely recognisable (inside and out). Forced to have plastic surgery and take drugs for weight loss by Liberace, Thorson has a bit of a crisis of identity, and the actor plays up the man's increasing confusion and frustrations perfectly illustrates all while remaining infatuated with the very source of his problems.<br /><br />Of course, as radical as Matt Damon's transformation is, it's nothing compared to Michael Douglas' impressive metamorphosis into Liberace. I must admit, at first I couldn't help but see the famous actor behind the facade, but as the runtime continued, Douglas gradually disappeared into the role, truly embodying the character. With a solid approximation of the flamboyant star's distinct voice and mannerisms, and some great costumes and makeup as his groundwork to build upon, the actor goes on to offer a multifaceted portrayal that never feels like an imitation or a caricature. Instead, he feels like a real person, full of insecurity, loneliness, longing, eccentricity, and vulnerability, exposing the actual man behind the larger-than-life persona.<br /><br />Together, Matt Damon and Michael Douglas form a completely believable couple, and at first their courtship is more or less positive. A lot of the film is dedicated to pillow talk between the two, and their conversations feel intimate and natural. Likewise, the film doesn't shy away from their physical interactions, providing a frank depiction of sex. A great deal of loving humour is also derived from the characters' innate eccentricities (again, just look at that cover!), and the filmmakers play up some of the inherent silliness and strangeness of the subject matter to great effect (Rob Lowe's character is especially memorable and should of got some form of a gong) without ever really sacrificing emotion or drama.<br /><br />With that said, as funny as a lot of the runtime can be, the narrative does eventually take some increasingly dark and unsettling turns, revealing the affair's more disturbing elements, including a particularly creepy desire from Liberace to adopt Thorson and literally re-shape him in his own image. This all leads to an interesting examination of emotional control, facades, fickle infatuations, the pitfalls of fame, and the consequences of insatiable desires. What starts out as a supportive relationship grows ugly and petty, and it becomes hard to watch as the two lovers try to spite each other in painful ways.<br /><br />Though the subject matter might seem inherently flashy on the surface, Steven Soderbergh mostly plays against expectations, and instead offers a rather restrained approach, opting for a more functional and modest cinematic form that adheres to a fittingly vintage look. Often letting the characters and situations simply speak for themselves, the director engenders a personal, intimate mood with well-crafted shots and movements that, while artistically designed, don't really draw attention to the filmmaking. That's not to say that the film is completely without spectacle, however, and there are key scenes where Steven Soderbergh definitely turns up the dial on his style knob.<br /><br />Several recreations of Liberace's on stage performances are all appropriately showy, with a few quick cutting close-ups of the talented artist's impressive finger work gliding across his piano. Some later scenes that follow Thorson through his drug addiction are also home to more kinetic visuals, with disorienting moving shots that go in and out of focus, replicating the characters' own distraught and paranoid state of mind. As one might expect, the production design itself is also dazzling, bringing the performer's shining costumes and extravagant homes to life, adding an invaluable sense of outrageous character and personality to the proceedings. And then of course there's the film's finale, which features a brief excursion into the surreal, playing up Liberace's penchant for glitzy excess one last time to great success.<br /><br />Richard LaGravenese's screenplay works in fine little dabs of detail, and serves up one or two aces. When Liberace's ageing mother (Debbie Reynolds, also totally awesome and terrific) hits the jackpot on the mansion's one-armed bandit, the machine refuses to cough up its reward. (He's forgotten to fill it again.) Scott goes to fetch Liberace, who apologises to his mother for the lack of coins. Her reply: &#34;I'll take a cheque.&#34;<br /><br />According to reports before the film's release, Steven Soderbergh apparently shopped the project around to several major studios, but all of them balked at the notion of making a film based on the topic. After watching the completed film, I really can't see what they were objecting too and us brits had no problem with the film, in fact we welcomed it with open arms of celebration, as we Brits are not upset with its subject matter. Sure, the concept isn't exactly commercial (OK, it's pretty damn far from commercial), but with Matt Damon, Michael Douglas, and Steven Soderbergh all on board, it at least had a good chance of drawing critical success and perhaps even some awards recognition (all things it has indeed garnered even in its small screen incarnation). Regardless, thankfully HBO snatched up the project, and the results are more than worthwhile. An intimate examination of jealousy, romance, overindulgence, and the crazy, hurtful things we can do to one another when love is involved, 'Behind the Candelabra' successfully peels back the surface layers of Liberace's later life, offering an emotional, humorous, thoughtful, and appropriately sparkling piece of filmmaking.<br /><br />Blu-ray Video Quality – The film is presented in a beautiful 1080p encoded image transfer in the 1.78:1 aspect ratio. Shot on the Red Epic, the film has a distinct style that looks quite nice on Blu-ray, enhancing the glittery, retro content of the story well. The digital source is mostly clean, but there is a light layer of noise visible from time to time, and a few isolated spikes in noise during darker scenes that can be a little distracting. The picture adheres to an intentionally soft appearance with a faintly diffuse glow that helps to create a certain &#34;vintage&#34; look. Though this softer quality does limit detail, clarity is still good and there is a solid sense of depth and fine textures in characters and wardrobe choices. To this end, all of Liberace's extravagant, glittery costumes sparkle off the screen and one can make out every speck of sequins. Colours are often cast in a golden sheen, and while the palette isn't particularly varied, the aesthetic fits nicely with the 1970s and 1980s setting. Thankfully, contrast is well balanced with steady black levels and good shadow delineation. Appropriately stylised with a soft, golden glow, 'Behind the Candelabra' looks very good on Blu-ray, preserving the director's intentions without any major issues.<br /><br />Blu-ray Audio Quality – The HBO film is provided with a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track and a 2.0 LPCM Audio Stereo track. Optional English SDH subtitles are also included. Modest but relatively engaging, this is a solid, albeit restrained mix. Speech is clear and well prioritised, giving ample presence to Michael Douglas' distinct take on Liberace's trademark voice. The track is fairly front-loaded, but effects like crowd reactions and applause during shows do hit the surrounds. Likewise, other ambient effects like crickets or background clatter in a rowdy club are dispersed naturally around the soundstage. Directionality is decent as well, with a few key sounds (like a door slamming off to the side) being relegated to the appropriate speakers. The piano music itself comes through with wonderful clarity and dimension, bringing great range and depth to the musical performances. With that said the film as a whole is rather quiet, with a subdued sense of space. Likewise, bass activity is negligible. The sound design is a little subdued, but the more delicate approach works well with the intimate subject matter. A bit more texture and immersion would have been welcomed, but as a whole this is a fitting mix.<br /><br />Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:<br /><br />Special Feature: The Making of Behind the Candelabra [2013] [1080i] [14:00] This HOB Special Documentary is presented with a 2.0 LPCM Audio Stereo and the same subtitle options as the main feature, this is a standard behind-the-scenes documentary with cast and crew interviews and on-set footage. The participants discuss adapting the source material, approaching the characters, and what is was like to work with Steven Soderbergh. Crew members also elaborate on recreating Liberace's extravagant homes and costumes, and there's even some brief archive footage of the man himself. Though this offers a little more than usual promotional stuff, the documentary is sadly is far too brief. Appearing in this HBO Special Documentary are Matt Damon, Michael Douglas, Marcus LaVoi, Rob Lowe, Debbie Reynolds and Jerry Weintraub.<br /><br />Finally, 'Behind the Candelabra' offers an intimate peek into superstar pianist Liberace's personal life and his turbulent affair with a younger man. Through their story, director Steven Soderbergh shines a particularly glittering light on a fascinating real-life figure, while simultaneously examining interesting concepts dealing with love, jealousy, excess, and fame. The Blu-ray features a strong video presentation that respects the director's intended aesthetic, and a solid audio mix. Sadly, we only get one brief documentary, but it's still worth a look. While this isn't the most impressive disc, the technical presentation is good and the film itself is a well-crafted biopic that will likely even appeal to those who might seem apprehensive about its subject matter. When I purchased the Region A/1 Blu-ray, I had no sound and so instead purchased this Region B/2 Blu-ray and it is absolutely stunning and the beautiful designed Embossed Slip Cover is definitely far superior to the Region A/1 Blu-ray Cover. So all in all this is a stunning film and presentation and has gone pride of place in my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!<br /><br />Andrew C.

B00AO3K01C|4.0|great read , beautifully written<br />loved it ....<br />would read it again ,<br />could really sense the places and the feelings in the story..
B002UNMWAG|4.0|The original Boondock Saints movie is among my favorites. I had purchased this sequel some time ago and, although it is quite different from the original, when it was lost to a friend I purchased this copy to replace it. I have purchased Blu-ray versions of a few movies I had on DVD but this is the first time I ever purchased a second copy of the same film. (Doesn't &#34;film&#34; and &#34;tape&#34; seem quaint?)
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I've been wanting to watch this since it was out at the theater.  I'm glad I finally got to watch it, it was well worth the time.
B000S0GYRU|4.0|This movie was recommended by a friend with a warning that, as a foreign horror film, it would be &#34;different&#34;. It was not as scary as I had been led to believe, but a good film non the less.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is time if the best books. I have read in a long time. I can not remember the last time I stayed up in to the wee hours of the night, trying to read as fast as I can, just to find out what happens next. Wool has definately sparked my interest in reading again.
B001AQQR2S|4.0|nice and free movie, I like it. It is a family movie although seems very old one, but that is OK.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|I was not aware this was a zombie flick; but to my surprise the movie turned out to be quite entertaining. I'm not a zombie fan, but I would reccomend this film.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great movie, excellent acting. I liked the retro of Kahn from the original series. Nice that they're not forgetting the &#34;roots&#34; of it all.
1936608898|5.0|Excellent links between theory and outcomes for health of eating whole foods. A life changing approach to living and eating
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|My daughter loves Monster High and movies.  This being a double feature was very exciting for her and she loved it.
B009GED3HS|5.0|one of the best shows of all time nothing better than it best comedy television show of all time ever
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought this story was amazing! There were so many twists and turns that I lost sleep over this book. What a page turner!<br /><br />Sky has been homeschooled her whole life, the only friend she had was Six, her next door neighbor. Every time Six brings over a guy to her house, Sky gets a guy too to make out with while she just floats away and stares at the stars on her ceiling. Then Sky decides she wants to go to public school her senior year. However, Six won't be there, and Sky is left going to a school where everyone thinks she's a slut.<br /><br />Then she meets Dean Holder, the most beautiful guy she's every seen who actually makes her feel something, unlike all the rest of the guys she used to make out with. He's emotional, and sometimes vague about some things. She falls for him, and they are the perfect match for each other.<br /><br />This book was probably one of the best books I've ever read. I would highly recommend this to anyone. It's got romance (the chemistry between these two is real) and some family drama (or mystery). This book exceeds my 5 star rating!
B0044KU7KU|4.0|I love the music and the CD wasn't scratched, however the reason I am giving this only four stars is because, when I received this package the case had been damaged, pieces of the plastic were falling off, and although I bought it used the description said &#34;USED: Like New&#34;. However, it was shipped in time.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|Love this show! Nope that is an Understatement!!! I hate waiting for the next episode to air; it almost drives me nuts....so much torture :)
1250029465|5.0|I wholeheartedly recommend this book.  It's about so much more than a cat, but the cat Bob is very endearing.  Kudos to James for telling the story of life on the streets with Bob, and how meeting the cat completely changed his life.  I rarely read a book that feels gratifying, but this story is one that makes you cheer for the author and for the loveable cat Bob.  I also learned something myself, in that, people on the street are not non-people.  Several chapters into the book, I passed an elderly trombone player on the street and gave him some money when I ordinarily would have walked on by.  A lesson well learned.<br /><br />I look forward to reading the next book about Bob.  What a light in an ordinarily dark world.
0307120007|1.0|The high star review ratings must be on the believed story itself, they can't possibly be on the quality of this book. Horrible quality. I have kept the book only because to ship it back would be a waste of more money. My son will never hold this book in his hands because I imagine it would only survive a few minutes. BEWARE and look for a different version.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's a lot to take in, so many people, so much going on. However, u couldn't put the book down.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I can't always avoid using an alarm clock, but if I need to use one this is it.  It downloaded very quickly and was extremely easy to set up.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I finished this book in one day my husband was pretty upset when he came home and saw that I had done nothing all day! It shows how events in people's life can affect others and had my attention from the very beginning!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|its hard to start out. u get a crap car and no points bout over all later it gets really fun.
B00CHVJI08|5.0|My grand children enjoy watching this together! Good movie for re watching on a wet and cold winter night!  FUN!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The book over-all was worth the read. It is a fun no-brainer.  I saw the twists coming but wanted to keep reading.  Fun, fast read.
0545265355|5.0|My daughter loved these books and this was a nice set at a very reasonable price. All the Books are Hardcover and Come In the Boxed Set. I was Really Happy with This Purchase!
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|The story keeps you guessing about the next turn of events - it is well written and well acted.  I would feel like Claire Danes is overacting except that we have a bi-polar, hyper-emotional, very smart member of our family.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I enjoy puzzle games and I liked this one.  It's similar to sudokr but you don't get to confused with the numbers. My only wish is that the numbers were a little larger; hard to see even with my glasses.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have only used this for Netflix and Youtube but it's great.  Even with a 1Mbps connection, the Chromecast is connected to my Kindlefire HD and it streams perfectly.  It's very easy to set up my 11 year old daughter and my 8 year old son set theirs up no problem.  In a world of expensive devices that let you down this is an inexpensive device that goes beyond what I expected.  With more features in the works it can only get better.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|I really loved this story. Enjoyed the simple tone of the characters and how the story evolved. Great page turner even though there were few of the usual gripping moments that cause you to stay up late turning pages
B007N85POS|5.0|This is awsome. The rio movie was great so was this game.<br /><br />I highly suggest those who like challenging games this game.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Learned more about Holy.  I had read the later books and this gave me more background.  Our friend Holy has a lot of problems but gets the job done.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Very convenient and easy to use.  Enjoy viewing this very much.  Many family and friends to connect with.<br />Thanks for the fine work!
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|There are very few albums that you can rank and say, \\"that is an epic album from top to bottom\\". This album is surely that and more, from the cover design to the lyrics, this album is by far their most powerful and heaviest album to date. Sadly this bad does not gain the fame as other mid level bands around who do but still, for those who know who are Alter Bridge, we are glad they are around.<br /><br />Farther Than The Sun, Cry A River, Cry Of Achilles, Addicted To Pain, Lover are my favorite ones from the album. All songs bring that heavy intensity with no letdown whatsoever in none of the songs.<br /><br />Tremonti's guitar in this album is sick, with the heaviness and rapid pace he brings to each song and with that cruel melody of joy in each song, it is very hard not to like any song here.<br /><br />I'd vote this album for album of the year in the Metal category, this album will absolutely blow you away.
6303122647|5.0|the nightmare before christmas is my all time favorite movie and to own it on vhs is awesome. just wish it came with the auctual case but im not complaining lol
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|All their albums till 'Take A Look In The Mirror' were great then...Head left, Silveria left and we were left with nothingness. Three of the last 5 albums have been atrocious. This album though, I hate the single \\"Never, Never\\", it is a stupid song but the rest of the album is great. The album still blending a few elements of their last pathetic album, this album kicks some of the rust and lameness of the last 6 years. The album overall is a 7.5/10, the highest I've given an album since like 2004.
B00D2PIUAM|5.0|An extraordinarily exciting, and electrifying, album that rocks from start to finish. From powerful, passionate vocals to searing guitars, driving bass and thundering drums, you are in for a real treat here. Like Silversun Pickups, Queens of The Stone Age, and Ghostland Observatory, this is a band that has steadily built a following while continuously enhancing their sound. Natural talent meets hard work, and yes...there is hope for progressive rock in today's musical climate. Placebo is living, breathing proof.<br /><br />The guitar-vocal double power punch of this lead singer is profound. He takes you on a journey with each song and shines in his unencumbered, relentless achievement in riveting the listener and leaving you deeply affected by the work. The range of his voice is stunning. Yes, you will be humming these tunes at work.<br />You must check out the instantly hypnotizing video for the single about gleefully letting go of technology and then blindly just pick one of their earlier releases, if you have not done so already. Every artistic bit of output by this band is worthwhile.<br /><br />My hope is that they bring their tour to America and deliver, once again, one of the most remarkable live performances you will ever see!<br /><br />Highly recommended...
B003V63VNI|5.0|This album is an amazing representation of how Boyd is as an artist outside of Incubus. He encompasses a line between pop and world like music in his album that is of great listen. I had hesitated to listen to it at first but now I'm glad I did, excellent album.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Interesting and funny. Very nice story and nice details; I don't think the criticism I've seen applies since the premise is not misleading if you've ever seen Star Trek or other such shows. I hope for more such work from Scalzi.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Simply great.  Everything about this ridiculous game is great.  Play is great.  Visuals are great concept is dumb but great.  Music is uh...pretty lame.  But the best part is the sound effects.  I can listen to someone else play it and still crack up at all the crashes and &quot;uh-oh&quot;s.  Love it!
B005COO1X6|4.0|I couldn't put it down.  It was a great read even if you are not a King fan and you are it is not his greatest work, but worth the read.
B00594XOZU|2.0|I was using kik perfectly fine then i logged out .now it  doent not want to log in no more tryed for a week now
159463176X|4.0|Enjoyed learning how other countries and cultures differed and there was plenty of action & suspense to not want to put the book down.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Lots of fun and addictive! Can't wait for more! Wish there was more pictures too look at then there is though.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Great little app. It is a must have for any gun enthusiast. Easily worth all five stars. Definitely worth the money.
B008RC72G8|3.0|The movie itself is nothing like the orginal Dark Shadows.  They put to much comedy in this one.  Johnny Depp was at his best as Barnabas.  Movie has near 3D effects on a high def TV!
B0053O89IS|5.0|What can I say.... HUGE Bones fan.  Watched all the seasons at least 3 times and I can't wait for Season Eight to come out.
B009G78EE2|2.0|I was a disappointed when I heard his songs. I kind wish I didn't buy it. It wasn't my style. The only song I liked was &#34;Can't hold us&#34;. Should of just bought the song only. I guess it really depends on your type of style.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|It is a good collection.  I just love the guy.  He plays dumb but he is smart and funny.  Just love watching Peter Falk's movies.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|I like the songs. I really don't know how I can share this experience except if this is the type of style you like then you would like them.

B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Great story, very original. Got to love that the heroine in the story doesn't look like a Disney princess. All 5 of my children loved it.
B0058YPL66|2.0|Bought this for my wife. A combo of soap opera, 1930's cliffhanger using as many Disney fairy tale characters as possible. Silly, but she likes it

B001DF68MA|3.0|Love this seat and the fact that it doesn't sit on the handlebars. But I'm not very happy with the seat belt. It's very big, my son is 20#'s and I had to tighten the straps as far as they would go and would like to tighten a little more still but cant. It holds him ok but as we were riding they started coming loose. I've had to re-tighten them several times and even put a knot on the back of the chair to help keep it tight. I've not yet had time to look into taking it apart to see if I can improve it.

B00EDOS6IC|5.0|ABIII hasn't even completely sunk it yet.. & the 3 year cycle ends :p This is one of the few bands that I wait for eagerly to release a new album.. remember the kind of feeling you had back in the day, before the release of a new Tool album... or Metallica, RATM, Soundgarden.. you feelin' it yeah ;) ?! so finally Alter bridge grace us with another offering in the form of Fortress.<br /><br />Below is my track by track review of what I must say, is one of the best Metal albums of 2013.<br /><br />CRY OF ACHILLES - one of the most beautiful, if not the best intros, I've heard to an opening track of any album in awhile.. the Spanish Acoustic guitar sound.. kinda reminded me of some work by Heitor Teixeira Pereira (Brazilian Musician) with Hanz Zimmer. The song itself bursts into awe inspiring energy soon after the 30 something seconds intro setting the tone for the rest of the album.. I could safely call it the \\"Ties that Bind\\" of Fortress!!<br /><br />ADDICTED TO PAIN - OK.. so when I heard this song first, to be honest I thought it was a mellowed down version of \\"Wish You Well\\" off the Tremonti Solo album.. yeah, that was until Myles vocals kicked in.. and then Mark's awesome guitar solo. I was sold by the end of the song. Myles' vocals have never been better, combine that with a mix of hard hitting drums and thrashy riffs, its already becoming a regular anthem at AB concerts as you read this, definitely the best choice as a kick off single from this album.<br /><br />BLEED IT DRY - one of the heavier songs on this album, Scott displays a good drumming technique making the song sound almost progressive! Myles vocals are haunting really, when he sings.. \\"one day you will see...\\" That takes us straight into Marks solo, which is probably one of the best on this album, touching Blackbird standards.<br /><br />LOVER - Myles vocal range shines here, starting off with slow acoustic guitar layered with Myles' airy vocals, this ones slower but much darker, very movie soundtrack like.. Reminiscent of Myles' past work with Mayfield Four, particularly the song \\"Carry On.\\" Marks guitar skills improve with every album and it really shows on this album, with every solo having a classy feel to it, one that sticks in your head, reminds me of a few early Satriani songs.<br /><br />THE UNINVITED - Yes Yes Yes everyone's ranting on about the Tool similarities, (Schism, Vicarious etc.) so what.. I don't think it was an intentional thing, rather influential. Its not the first time any band has done that, you are a product of your environment after all.. listen to \\"Build your Cages by Pulse Ultra\\" , it very similar. The Alter Bridge we hear on Fortress isn't the Alter Bridge from their past 3 albums.. and if anything, the song is heavy and raging full of energy, just the way it should be!<br /><br />PEACE IS BROKEN - this song can be easily placed on any of the last two AB releases, in simple words its just classic Alter Bridge, Soaring vocals with an awesome riff to go with.. pure melodic metal! This could very likely be a second single.<br /><br />CALM THE FIRE - this is yet again something fresh coming from AB with its MUSE like song structure and progression. After one and a half minute into the song I actually had to hit back and listen again.. Myles vocal range is really incredible here. He even does a bit of trading vocals with himself in the verses, really amazing to listen to. More than anything it shows how tight AB is as a band and that they're not afraid to take chances with the music they make.<br /><br />WATERS RISING - I remember when I first heard Mark singing on the song \\"My Own Prison\\" back in 1997 from Creed's first album, and thought to myself as a joke, hey.. there's a guitarist who casually steps in for a few lines :) Not a bad idea really given the state of the Rock music scene of the 90's. Then last year Mark goes on lead vocals on his own solo project, truly shining on his own. He's come a long way since My Own Prison, and judging from the last AB release, I  kinda expected a lead vocal song by Mark on an upcoming AB release. Vocal trade offs between Mark and Myles are nothing new and flawlessly displayed here on Waters Rising, though, what the good eared listener will find really interesting on this song are the rare elements of oriental metal.<br /><br />FARTHER THAN THE SUN - The bass guitar tone really stands out here making this probably the heaviest song on FORTRESS, More melodic metal with an amazing bridge here taking the song straight from 1st to 5th gear and into the lead solo.<br /><br />CRY A RIVER - Listen to how this song begins and how it ends, like 2 completely different songs blend together to make one, shows a great aspect of Myles' & Mark's song writing style.. simply amazing I'd say.. a straight up rocking tune and metal radio friendly for sure.. especially how the lead follows along with the drums towards the end is just killer.<br /><br />ALL ENDS WELL - ever since Creed days, we've all waited for that one signature song on every preceding album, that to many is like the satisfaction of buying any album in the first place.. of-course not in the case of bands like Alter Bridge, every song holds its own here, but somehow they manage to throw in the mix, a song like \\"All Ends Well\\" which clearly shows their roots and every aspect of their tight musicianship. This song is definitely gonna be a crowd sing along with its ballad like groove, inspiring lyrics and of-course Myles' uplifting vocals.<br /><br />FORTRESS -  Clocking in at over 7 and a half minutes, the Epica so to say, of this album is finally here in closing, a staple theme for AB since Blackbird. Big chorus here and an awesome unexpected thrash inspired riff that takes the listener by surprise will please enough mosh pits, all of that followed by a very Machine Head sounding guitar solo brings us to the end of a 1 hour plus journey of classy metal that will definitely stand the test of time.<br /><br />My final words on this album.. its one hell of a Metal genre ride really, I now understand what Myles and Mark meant when they said that they haven't taken as many chances on any other albums, as they have taken on Fortress, and I know many fans are pleased finally, because this was what they had wanted ABIII to sound like.. well better late than never, I'm an AB fan just like you and any new music coming from them is always welcome. For me though, more than anything else I admire the magnetic power and ability AB's music has.. one to make you forget everything else that you're listening to. How they aren't a Multi Platinum selling band is just beyond me! Then again maybe its a good thing that's working out in their favor.. the last thing we need is another radio station butchering AB the way they did Creed.<br /><br />All in all, Alter Bridge shine again and as usual no disappointments here, my advise... be original - buy original, support your favorite artists.dging from the last AB release, I  kinda expected a lead vocal song by Mark on an upcoming AB release.

B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This book was exciting to read, but full of short, choppy sentences. They were somewhat distracting, but the story was excellent and kept me guessing who the final bad guy was. I will definitely be reading more Jack Reacher stories.
B0000793Z9|5.0|I was a casual Simple Minds listener back in the 80s.  I never had any of their catalog, but I love this album.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag seems more designed for full sized DSLRs, but it works just fine for a Sony Nex as well.  The main part of the bag can be modified to fit whatever lenses, flashes, batteries, etc into velcro partitioned areas.  There are two thin pockets on the interior of the main pocket that are perfect for manuals, warranties, disks, cleaning wipes, etc.  Additionally, there is a thinner pocket that fits netbooks or tablets (a little large for my Motorola Xoom, but a little small for my 14&#34; Asus Vivobook).  A zipper pouch in the front is great for tabletop tripods, lens cleaners, and anything you need quick access to.  The left side of the bag has two straps to secure a larger collapsing tripod (fits nicely no worries about dropping it), and two small pockets on either side that perfectly fit the AmazonBasics SD Card Case.  The straps are comfortable and even has a click waist belt in addition to the shoulder straps.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|Loved the movie! Thought it was action packed with a good cast. Looking forward to the next movie in series.
B00FKE3H0G|4.0|I downloaded the album yesterday and I have to say, I'm actually impressed. It's not a hip hop album as it was touted to be but rather a fun pop album with a teeenny hip hop influence if at all. At the end of the day, she can actually sing and the album is a showcase of her talents. The album's opener, 'Adore You' is a soulful ballad which takes you back to old-school-Miley. At 27 years old, I'm definitely not a fan girl so speaking rationally, yeah, it's a pretty decent album.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan nails it again and I can't wait for the next book to find out what happens to Percy and AnnaBeth!

B0013TXA5Y|3.0|After hearing a few of my [adult] friends go on and on about how good the series was (and with the arrival of the movie) I decided to finally breakdown and read City of Bones.  I should have stuck to my guns and left it alone.  It would have saved me about 12 hours of reading.  The book itself was an easy read and SHOULD have been right up my ally as far as supernatural/paranormal/sci-fi genres go.  However, I was sorely disappointed.  I knew most of the storyline before hand and I'm NOT a huge fan of predictable books.  I'm extremely tired of the 'love triangle' scenario that most YA authors seem to think is necessary for a good story. Not to mention that this book reads almost identical to the first installment of 'The Infernal Devices' series from this author as well (yes, I know that the names are different and the heroines have different abilities, but beyond that they really are the same story and just as predictable).  I will not be suffering through the entire series, the inside covers provide me enough information to figure out how the story ends.  I'm sure to most teens/young adults this is a very intriguing book series, but it's just not for me.  And because I initially enjoyed the Twilight series I assumed I would find this a good read, but alas the story doesn't really focus on the budding love story or being a Shadowhunter in depth.  The characters aren't real enough, in my opinion, and therefore makes the story itself rather dull.  I gave it three stars simply because the idea and concept of the Shadowhunters interests me, but other than that it was all kind of... meh.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|My Answer, nope. I love this show. You know when you start saying you are going to &#34;gank&#34; something you are not only a fan of this dynamic duo but are a fan for life.

I don't think the crossover to contemporary  was very successful . It was missing the drama and lightheartedness the original had , and the written play as well....I thought the production was poor as well.....sorry this one just doesn't get my vote at ALL !!!!!!

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King fans, a must read. Sequel to The Shining. Danny Torrance is no longer a child, rather a man in his 40s, battling his own demons, and haunted by the memories of The Overlook Motel.
B001BANK32|4.0|Classic Stephen King novel that hooks you in before you realize it. Like many of his books, you will look up after reading a short time only to discover hours have passed and your well planned day has been derailed. Not as horrifying or demented as some, but solidly belongs in the horror story Hall of Fame.

B00BEIYH6U|5.0|If u wanna quick badass movie to watch here and there watch this. Perfect, funny, action packed, and stayed true to the original even tho there were a few flaws. If your a big fan on Kick-Ass like I am, your gonna have to see this one it rules. It also changes the story a lot. I'd say this was better than the first just a little bit. This was more face paced than the first. Doesn't really feel like a movie but a movie that can really KICK ASS.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you liked the shining you will love this! It is the perfect ending for the boy who survived the overlook motel<br />It is a must read
B00ECLU346|2.0|Total departure from the usual &#34;Hangover&#34; antics, and not a step forward in terms of comedy.  The usual banter wasn't really there, and when there was a &#34;back and forth&#34; it generally sounded dumb.  It looked like they threw the movie together and pushed it through production without really stepping back and asking &#34;is this funny?&#34;  or &#34;does this seem a little pushed?&#34;.  Almost like they wanted to &#34;just finish&#34; the trilogy.<br /><br />Not a funny movie; not at all.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|This is a comparative  critique of Charles Frazier's novel Cold Mountain and the film of the same name. I saw the film when it was first released and it was a gem of a movie. Recently I read Charles Frazier's novel and found the book to be significantly different from the film.<br /><br />The basic outline of Frazier's story forms the core of the movie but the love story between Ada Monroe and Inman is very different in the novel. The magnetic attraction between the two drives the movie and provides the emotional tension that keeps the viewer alert, almost like a mystery plot. Will the two survive to meet and live happily ever after? Charles Frazier's novel does not use that tension to drive the story.<br /><br />The first scene in the book is set in the Petersburg hospital and Inman's motivation to desert his regiment after years of loyal service is his disillusionment with the war. Ada Monroe does not enter his thoughts by name until he is well on his way home. The reader puts the two together when the author makes Ada the subject of the next chapter but she, too, is not consumed with longing for Inman. Rather, Ada is occupied with growing up and surviving after her father passes away. When Ruby Thewes enters her life midway through the chapter Ada's attention centers around her relationship with the capable and earthy young woman.<br /><br />Well past halfway into the novel Inman finally reveals that when (and if) he meets Ada Monroe he will declare his intentions right away and, if he is rebuffed, he will turn back around and keep walking. For her part, Ada only thinks of Inman during quiet moments of solitude and is not sure he is still alive. Whether or not they will live happily ever after - or even meet again - is only inferred by the structure of the novel. Even if I hadn't seen the movie first I would have expected that conclusion but it is not uppermost in the minds of the characters.<br /><br />Both the book and the movie, then, are beautiful depictions of the same story as if you had heard alternate versions of a story about a neighborhood couple from two trusted friends. The various vignettes that the film's fans know well are mostly all different from the book. The various Home Guards are not half the antagonists in the book as they are in the movie and Captain Teague has no back story, no motivation, in the novel.<br /><br />Inman, Ada, Ruby, Stobrod and Reverend Monroe are all finely drawn characters and everybody else, including even Esco and Sally Swanger, are background figures. Inman's journey is not so much Homer's Odyssey in the book. Anthony Minghella  used the Odyssey as a concept for the film before he wrote the screenplay, as he relates in the Extra Feature interview. The human interactions of the vignettes provide the constant motion that contemporary filmgoers expect but in the novel the geography, the weather, the wildlife, the food and Inman's solitude are all virtual characters in a way that would have ground the film to a halt.<br /><br />The movie has all that exquisite cinematography and an excellent soundtrack written by Gabriel Yared. The period music is well researched under the experienced guidance of T-Bone Burnett. The extended version DVD includes the feature, \\"The Music of Cold Mountain\\", which I highly recommend. One surprise for me was the writer of the song, \\"My Ain True Love\\" - Sting. The mysticism of Ada's vision from Sally's well is an invention of screenwriter Anthony Minghella. That minor sub-plot serves to create a subtle tension and a gentle resolution at film's end but Charles Frazier did not intend Ada's vision in the well to be a plot device.<br /><br />To me, Jude Law fit Charles Frazier's portrait of Inman very nicely and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger was a perfect Ruby Thewes. Every other face fit nicely into Frazier's characters except Nicole Kidman. She was fine in the movie but I do not think Kidman would have been Frazier's pick had he been given the choice, not the way he drew Ada Monroe in the novel. Read the book and see if I'm right. Who would you have rather seen as Ada Monroe?<br /><br />*Update for Civil War buffs:<br /><br />Inman was probably a member of the 49th North Carolina Infantry. Charles Frazier does not identify Inman's regiment in the novel but the 49th was everywhere Inman was, including the first regiment north of the South Carolina brigade that was the victim of the Petersburg Mine explosion. They were also in the thick of the fighting at the Battle of Weldon Railroad later where Inman received his neck wound in the book, as opposed to the movie where he was wounded in a night skirmish a few days after the Battle of the Crater.<br /><br />Then there is a problematic scene in the movie after Inman deserts. He is seen walking on a beach with his right shoulder towards the water - walking north, but that's not the real error. For a Confederate deserter to leave Petersburg from the hospital he would have had to go west toward the Danville Road then turn south. Access to the Virginia coastline was controlled by Yankee troops in 1864. In the book Frazier never traces Inman's route on a map but he never wrote a scene involving an ocean. An appendix in the novel mentions the reference book North Carolina Troops in the Civil War as well as Charles Frazier's extensive hikes in the Blue Ridge Mountains of southwestern Virginia and North Carolina so any historical inconsistencies are a fault of the film, not the novel.<br /><br />Is the story an anti-war parable? I do not think the novel is anti-war so much as it is historically accurate. After Sherman captured Atlanta and siege warfare settled on the Army of Northern Virginia the fate of the south was sealed. Many North Carolina soldiers deserted in the winter of 1864-65 so Inman's decision would not have been unique. This is just the first fictional story to give voice to those deserters as opposed to the ill-fated men who fought on to Appomattox and had their stories pass into legend. And Inman was still a formidable warrior on his journey, several times engaging adversaries that outnumbered and outgunned him but still he came away victorious. Frazier's story and Minghella's film tell a mostly overlooked tale about the people of a conquered nation and how they dealt with the lives they were forced to live. That is not anti-war, just reality as it was in 1864.Ada Monroe in the novel. Read the book and see if I'm right.

B008OOYALE|4.0|I got this app and I totally loved it at first try!be careful though, because you have to have Internet access to play. however,this is a great app and I love it would totally digest it to every one!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Because it was a book that held my interest, the characters were believable and I liked the way the author ended the book with what could have happened vs what happened
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very steamy and very engaging book. I could not put it down. I loved the emails going back and forth.....foreplay!<br />I even read this book a 2nd time....it was that great.
B00BKTFABE|1.0|Started looking up on me and now force closes every time. Don't know what's wrong but will try to download again.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Wish I had read this book years ago.<br />A must read! You too will be touched...and inspired....and perhaps change how you see life unfolds.
B00B89LZ4C|4.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. I read other reviews about the package having been opened and taped at the bottom. I still purchased it knowing this. This DOES NOT come with the bag of crystal mentioned in the description. I think that is why they have been unsealed at the bottom and taped closed. Other than this issue, I found it to be a great collectible and am not disappointed in my purchase.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I just enjoyed the romance and steamy moments. Can't wait for the movie to come out, but how will they ever show such steamy moments without the movie being x-rated? Can't wait to watch!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Needs to be updated and the fact that amazon has a shit amount of apps that sucks leaves me wishing I got an iPad for my bday instead of the kindle fire hd
1452126607|5.0|A whole year of Grumpy Cat!  The photos are what you'd expect of Grumpy - very cute.  The day boxes have room to write dates and appointments unless you want to save for a keepsake.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This was my first Jojo Moyes novel. She builds believable and delightful characters in her book with whom you instantly form a relationship. Be prepared, however, to read this book in the privacy of your room where you can cry unashamedly! Its a real tear-jerker. Which will have you clamouring for more of this author's books.
1452126577|5.0|Grumpy Cat is the greatest!  I hate it!!!  Actually the book is fun for about any age.  The layout is perfect for just browsing when you need something to read for a few minutes.  It's amazing how much it cheers you up to look at something so grumpy!!
B00F57VFXO|5.0|A unique twist on Hitler's story.<br />I received an e-copy of the book from the author in exchange for an honest review.<br />Operation Parsifal is an exciting read as we find ourselves in the 1945 when 17F is placed in the odd position of finding a way to stop an assassination plot against Hitler. In true Bond style, Fleming is paired with a gorgeous. Their adventures, spy-gadgets and exotic locales are once again reminiscent of the best 007 flicks. But this fast-paced, edgy, well written book is so much fun you won't want to wait for the movie. It's a must read for Bond lover, or anyone who just loves action, suspense, mystery and thrillers!<br />I loved the ending of the story it actually gave me chills..
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Just for killing a bit of time in the airport - Grisham follows his tried and tested recipe, nothing too exciting or different. Just ok.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game at first I thought it was boring but I guess I was wrong cause its awesome
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is probably ones of they best video games I've played in year's. It is one that can be enjoyed hy both adults &amp;kids at the same time. There is (in my opinion) a very minimal amount of violence. (Just &quot;Minion -Style violence)  It's a game parent's can let their kid's play and not worry about what is happening on the screen. (Just have your Parental Codes set so the kiddo's won't go off andy bye any &quot;GRU Coins&quot;. As these do cost REAL MONEY.)  However,  my Kindle -Fire will jot allow Ms to purchase absolutely anything, so in my house we're O.K. with not buying &quot;GRU COINS &quot;.  So far, we /I have gotten over 120 &quot;GRU COINS &quot; without. spending any REAL MONEY,  so trust me,  it can be done.<br />Go ahead and get this FREE game; you won't be sorry you did.  That is unless your like me and wind up playing it tor hours and hours and hours and hours .....
1401937268|5.0|I've been reading the traditional tarot cards for awhile. A couple of years ago I bought Doreen's Angels and Ascended Masters deck...I love them too. The 'Angel Tarot' cards added new dimensions of awareness and they take everything to new levels.<br /><br />Now I use all 3 decks in my tarot sessions, depending on what the client asks for. When they ask for messages from the angels and guides, I use one of Doreen's decks. Other times I use the traditional tarot.<br /><br />The angel tarot energy is loving, gentle and very insightful. Using the angel and angel & ascended masters card decks has deepened my intuitive connection and understanding of the messages that come through to me. My readings have much more meaning now, for me and my clients.
B001OKGV6W|5.0|Damn good flix! Great tribute to the late Carl Sagan! Watch it today and pass it on! A winner indeed!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Perfect compliment to Netflix and YouTube for your TV. I use it with my phone and tablet. Easy to install and use. I placed it through my receiver not directly on my TV which is perfect to get sound through the surround sound system. I just wish it had or will have the capability to do slide show of photos and music as well.
0345803485|3.0|I haven't had a chance to read it yet, but it is on my reading list, so I will definitely get to it.  The book arrived in fine condition;  I have no complaints.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved this book and could not put it down...recommended it to many friends and used it as our book club read one month!
B000OV85AW|5.0|Just a man who can't be restrained. It might take him some time to get it done, but sooner or later he disappears! Based on true-life experiences of his character, McQueen does his usual commendable representation and captivated my interest to the end. Well worth the watch in my opinion.
B004GXZ69W|3.0|This mouse is very comfortable and eases wrist discomfort.  BUT I had to return the first one because it wasn't compatible with Microsoft.  I've ordered another because the IT guy said it was bad.<br />We'll see when I receive the new one.
B000VDUWMC|3.0|This is a very informative, interesting look at human history. Well worth the read! However, the text relies on several tables and illustrations which are either formatted poorly in the Kindle edition, or not in it at all. Amazon needs to pressure the publisher to fix this. It's a great book, and it deserves better formatting.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Excellent book. My daughter (14yo) was reading it and kept remarking how good it was and that I (52yo) should read it. So I took her advice. It's a great book to read together. Very captivating.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Love this series.  Hope it has many more seasons. Great cast.  Enjoy Stana and Nathan's relationship story line.  Looking forward to Season 6.
B008Y212PI|5.0|These puzzles will keep you using your logic skills until you have solved them all.  Nicely addictive.  Hints keep you going, if you get stuck.
B00C5R8364|5.0|Good story. Plot unfolds as you read, rather than predictable. Good pace.<br />Liked the writing. Very descriptive, but crisp and to the point. Both entertaining and enlightening.<br />This was my first for this author. Will definitely try more of his work.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Musically its Untouchables melded with Take a Look In the Mirror.  Lyrically its a bit of Follow the Leader and Issues.  If you're worried about the wubwub (dubstep), don't.  There is a few slight electronic sounds, nothing close to Path of Totality (which I actually enjoyed), but it melds with the guitars very well and is barely noticeable unless you are trying to hear it.  I only noticed it a few times in the outro and intro of a couple songs.<br /><br />The album is mostly deep and low, signature KoЯn style, but heavy and upbeat at other times.  If you didn't like their first single Never Never (I do), don't base the album on that one song, its the only one on the entire album that has a 'pop-like' beat.  The rest is dark and very melodic, I missed this sound, one of my best purchases of the year, no regrets.  Do yourself a favor and either listen to this on a nice speaker system or a nice pair of headphones instead of earbuds, at least for the first listen through.  Hearing Head and Munky playing back forth in the left and right speakers is so good to hear again!<br /><br />I highly recommend it, even if you've never listened to KoЯn this is a perfect place to start and work backwards through their work.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Fortress is like a kick in the ass that will not let you sit quiet . Thunderheart , hard , powerful but melodic and heavy . It may be the most complete and varied album of ALTER BRIDGE and the cd with the longest songs . An example of the variety of styles of FORTRESS is Cry of Achilles , a song with progressive influences like the song that gives the title to this album , Fortress . Then this cd has a long list of the hardest songs that have been recorded ALTER BRIDGE such as Bleed it dry , The uninvited , Cry a river ... I 'm a guy who usually the singles are not my favorite songs , but I love Addicted to pain , that belongs to the list of hard songs I mentioned before . As with every Alter Bridge album , there is a place for melodic songs like the unusual Lover ( awesome mid-tempo)brilliantly sung by Myles Kennedy and the wonderful All ends well . When I heard that in this album was going to be a song sung by mr . Tremonti I don't know what to think about this but Waters rising , that is the song in question , is fantastic and Mark does a work so remarkable as he did in his solo album and also has a place to sing Myles Kennedy what makes the song something special . Calm The Fire is a break in this cd because ,for me , apart from being a very good song , I see a resemblance to MUSE , in the melody and the voice of Myles (may it is a delusion of mine ).To finish, I want to highlight the good work that has made Michael \\"Elvis\\" Baskette with the production of this album, giving it a heavier and strong sound , which is what he could not get in the production of ABIII , although ABIII is a awesome album.FORTRESS is the album that every fan of Alter Bridge waiting for this band and that every follower of hard rock and modern metal should buy. Recommended!!!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I am admittedly addicted to this game,  have to find out where it leads me.  Try this hidden objects game for yourself.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|It didn't win any oscars, but it wasn't trying to. Very fun movie and worth watching if you're looking for something you don't need to think about.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is a great app. it gives you everything that youd need to know and more, and its super accurate.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|This is proof of nothing. Just another anecdotal account of the &#34;after life experience.&#34; Because it is told by a scientific person, it is supposed to be more believable? Whatever happens in these situations is still unknown. Scientific theories mix with beliefs, as in Dr. Alexander's case, and, really, reveal nothing concrete. I take his experience at face value, but, again, it is just another anecdotal account.
B0013TTK9E|5.0|I got pulled in so quickly by this novel. There were some slower parts but it was definitely an amazing read.
B00CWVFZ8W|2.0|I'm a fan of this genre, but this particular movie was rather silly.  Disappointed in the acting and effects, especially since there were some good actors in it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|what an amazing story. i loved the way it was written. i felt like i was the one living it. wow!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|My 13 year old son had recommended the movie and I decided to read the book instead.  This is a phenomenal book that is so rich and profound. This book is a masterpiece that no two hour film can capture. I would recommend this book to any in need of a literary journey through the hearts of men and women. I am only half way through the book but am already dreading the day when my trip will have to end.
B000UZQIDS|5.0|the answer is YES! such an amazing book. learned to love my favorite characters even more. absolutely wonderful read. try it!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Wonderful sounds. The variety is great! My favorite part about this app is that you can make your own combinations.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I just discovered Downtown Abbey last month and, as someone who is NOT a fan of tv, I have become completely addicted to this show. The acting is superb, the costuming and sets are breathtaking and the storylines will consume you.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|I especially enjoyed this book.  His recollections of his different experiences when he was deployed were so well written.  I felt like I was right there.  When I started this book, Chris was still alive.  So finishing the book after he was killed just really touched my heart.  My prayers are with his wife and family.  God Bless you all.

0756404746|3.0|When I read a fantasy novel, I'm looking for the author's imagination to take me to strange places and show me strange things. I'm searching for a feeling. A successful author imparts feelings that enrich the story. Patrick Rothfuss succeeds in this with both the writing style, and the the deep and interesting world he created.<br /><br />Here is the problem. While the fantasy aspects of the book are well thought out and leave me wanting more, the mundane aspects of the book are simplistic and annoying. So much time and energy is spent on Kvothe's money issues, but the author paints a picture that makes no sense. Why does Kvothe have to beg and steal? Why can't he simply work? Why is it that when Kvothe needs money, suddenly he can earn it? What started off as gritty, slowly turns irritating as it becomes painfully obvious that the author is attempting to impart his political bias to the reader. This wouldn't be so bad, if it wasn't for the simplistic view of a world of haves who are generally evil, and have-nots who are morally challenged because of the evil rich.<br /><br />All that said, the story of Kvothe is definitely interesting and leaves me wanting to know what happens next even while the political commentary seemingly gets more and more overt and annoyingly so.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I wish that there are apps that is compatible with cheomecast. Currently its too limited to be really useful, hopefully there will be some available soon.
B004GYY714|5.0|Love it!! TuneIn gives me access to tons of stations that I cannot receive, locally. So easy to use, too!
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|There are plenty of in-depth reviews here on Amazon, so I will keep this one short. Dream Theater has been on the top of my list for a very long time now, they make music that grabs me like no other band has, and their newest release is no different. This one deserves top-five placement in my personal ranking of Dream Theater albums, I love it.<br />I enjoyed their previous release, \\"A Dramatic Turn of Events\\", quite a bit. Although there are a couple tracks on that album (and the few before that) that I occasionally feel the urge to skip. \\"Dream Theater\\" feels more solid to me, each track has something different to offer and it doesn't feel as if an hour has passed when the album has done a full spin. As a drummer myself, being able to hear Mike Mangini unleash his creativity is great!<br /><br />Dream Theater fans are hard to please after 11 albums (this being their 12th), but this fan is more than happy! Can't wait to hear it on tour!
B009CYCF5I|5.0|I had heard a new song RUN and was trying to find it... Here it is. She wrote it for Willow.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|This is a fine game, but you DO have to unlock the entire game if u want to get past the first plane!<br /><br />I love MTG, and this game captures the essence of the table top game.  It is also a great tutorial, if you don't already know how to play.
B00ECTZKJ6|4.0|Korn have long given up on what the critics think or what direction their fans think they should be heading in, even with the return of much missed original member Brian \\"Head\\" Welch Korn are continuing to experiment with new sounds in many ways showing that their last album the dup-step influenced \\"the Path Of Totality\\" was not a one off. Jonathan Davies has even go so far saying that the decision to release the first single \\"Never Never\\" which itself would not have sounded out of place on \\"The Path of Totality\\" was just to mess with people's heads.<br /><br />\\"The Paradigm Shift\\" is Korns 11th studio album and the first one to feature founding member Brian Welch since 2003's \\"Take A Look In The Mirror\\", it features a mish mash of styles from the heavy pounding of \\"What We Do\\" to the death vocal driven \\"Love & Meth\\" which see Davis twist his vocal range from the straightforward approach to a death roar. Album opener \\"Prey For Me\\" at times sees Korn dip into their early signature sound with it being driven by Fieldys click slap bass. \\"Tell Me What You Want\\", \\"Punishment Time\\" and \\"Mass Hysteria\\" are tracks that all stand out.<br /><br />Nearly twenty years on from their vital self-titled debut korn have come a long way and are in a position where if they try something new they will be criticised for not sounding like the old Korn, the same can be said if they go back and try their old sound they will accused of being stale. In many ways \\"The Paradigm Shift\\" is a slow burner of an album that takes a while to reveal its layers which in many ways is similar to 2002's now much loved masterpiece \\"Untouchables\\". So take the time to give it more than one listen.
B008RZ99DY|4.0|If you need another review to convince you to buy this freaking slab of sonic genius then you've been living under a rock for 45 years on a island. 5* is insufficient. Now what's important is this the BEST version of this holy grail of alternative rock? I have no clue, not owning every version of this LP/CD ever released. But having lived with it and played it more obsessively than any other record for 45 years I AM disturbed by the REMIX of the original album. That is the exact term the CD uses in its credits, NOT remastered. I noticed more scratchiness and occasionally hiss, and the guitars don't punch out of the mix at times where they did originally. So while these may be imperceptible to casual listeners it bothered me enough that I won't be replacing my earlier rips to my iTunes library with this edition. On the other hand this edition has a treasure trove of extra tracks(especially a raging version of European Son that brings it closer to Sister Ray in wallop) and the Scepter Studio acetate version sounds great- easily worth the price of admission alone(at least the way I bought it, used & discounted). So as long as you're not expecting any improvement in the original record's sound and just want the extras/Scepter version demos you'll be delighted.

B002R5QPRI|5.0|Nice DVD, decent quality. It's Whitney and Costner at their finest :).  Inexpensive and good buy for the price and quality, but it's nothing special. Worth it if you're a Houston fan
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Just started season one (I know, I'm way behind) because I'd heard so many good things about the series. Haven't seen them all yet but have to say I'm looking forward to the rest. Hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys, which makes it interesting. Well plotted and very well acted. I highly recomment it -- if you're not too uncomfortable with a little nudity and fairly realistic looking violence.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Mahjong is one of my favorite games. Like that you can choose the intensity. I recommend this as one game in your library.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|Wish I had read it 10 years ago when my father suffered with Alzheimer's. a reminder of how (or not) to deal with the disease.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Beautiful extended music mix video.  There is actually substance under all the fluff, violence and gorgeous visuals and killer soundtrack.<br /><br />This just gets a high rating, because I don't seem to get sick of this movie.  It isn't the highest form of art., Even on that count, I kind of feel it is above average.  I suppose others would file this under guilty pleasure.  I don't feel guilty.<br /><br />Extra minutes and extras giving more background.  Not necessary, but maybe helpful for those who left the theater scratching their heads.<br /><br />***spoiler***<br />The one thing the movie sells you on and still not shown.  Tease!
B00AKKS278|5.0|A wonderful non-fiction read.  The author writes in a way that is upbeat and completely do-able.  I definitely recommend this book.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Entertaining..love a good fight. Even better when the good guys win. I'm glad I can watch it when ever I need to get my suit fix on amazon.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|My son loves this app and although he is a little young for all of the games in this app he can still maneuver through the app to the ones he can do. He would play this game for hours if I let him.

B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect but I really like this game. Lots of game play for free, can't beat that. Only downside is that i have to remember to check in everyday so I can get my reward but other than that it's great.
B008469DGY|5.0|This game is really fun. You simply flick your finger to shoot the ball. The idea is to land as close to the hole as possible. The farther away you are the lower the score. Also watch the cross winds.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|All I can say is I am obsessed!  I have told every person breathing in my life about this series!  It is for sure Hunger Games meets the bachelor.  I love it!  I love that I don't know who I want to root for!!  Can't wait until May got the conclusion.
B0002HY7JG|4.0|This is so cute, but it's very very tiny! No one would ever mistake this for a real bird! But like I said, it's pretty!
B005MVLI8A|5.0|Loved the first one, love this one. Glad they remastered it. Sounds just as perfect as it did the first time.
B00D2I8E46|5.0|This is an amazing album! The colab between one of my favorite bands THe Roots and Elvis Costello is absolutely brilliant!  I had to listen to this on repeat that how good it is!! I would recommend this to anyone out there to purchase.
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|The first of what I hope will be many. A space opera grand in scale, subtle in its details, with world-building that also questions how identity is constructed.

B0079T9HL8|5.0|This Item is a god-send.  Previously, I used a CarrySpeed Strap which I recommend highly and prefer to the BlackRapid by quite a bit.  However, I am slightly disabled and walk with a cane.  This made the \\"sash\\" style strap a little less convenient.  The Cotton Carrier holds my DSLR on my chest where it does not swing in the least (like a shoulder strap does) and keeps it so conveniently at the extreme ready.  I generallly shoot with one camera body.  The carrier I got came with a side holster and additional hub.  So I jerryrigged the hub to my ditty (tool) bag to keep my light meter and viewing filter at the ready.  I recommend this product to any active shooter who may need to have both hands free from time to time and still wants their camera highly protected while instantly available.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites! Absolutely love it! The picture was very clear and there was no skips or any scratches in the movie :) A+++++

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is a kind of book that you don't want to stop reading it.<br /><br />If you read it I hope you'll like it just like me.
159514188X|3.0|The concept of this book is very unique and unlike any other book I have read.  Hannah Baker is a high school student struggling to cope with life and end up commiting suicide.  Before she does however, she tape records her story and her 13 reasons (other people at school) as to why she committed suicide.  The tapes are being sent from person to person on the list.  As you read this book, it's Clay Jenson's turn to listen to the tapes. Clay's reactions to hearing the tapes are heartfelt, and he seems like a very likable guy.<br /><br />This book came recommended to me, with a lot of hype as to how great it was.  With that in mind, I guess I expected something more from Hannah's tapes.  This is not a bad book, don't get me wrong.  I just felt it didn't live up to the expectations that came along with it.  You know like with a movie where everybody talks about how great it was, and you finally see the movie, and it was good, but not THAT good?  That's kind of what happened with this book.  I did enjoy the book.  I have read a fair amount of young adults book (as a mother in her mid forties), and this book made me feel like I was reading a young adult book.  It made me feel like I shouldn't be reading it.  Like I was reading a young girls diary, that was very private, and I had no business reading.  Maybe that's a sign of a good author, to make me feel like the book was that up close and personal?  But I did come away thinking that this book was generally for a younger generation than my own.  And thinking back it was a younger generation that recommended the book so highly.  So maybe age has something to do with the liking of the book?  Just a thought.<br /><br />The book was written as a double narrative, which I did find confusing at times.  That took some getting used to.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love this product. Works great from all my devices. Just waiting for more apps to work with it. Simply amazing.
B009KWU6Q2|1.0|I loved this movies as a kid, but I wish I had left it in the past. Aside from Dustin Hoffman, all performances are cripplingly bad. Avoid.

B004SZHIR6|2.0|I was very glad to get BD resolution in full 1080p but that's all I can say in favor of this edition. For me it had serious issues.<br /><br />In the first place, despite listing for &#34;Region B/2, Region A/1&#34; it still would not show any picture at all on my Panasonic BluRay disc player. It would not even after I made the special effort of updating the player's firmware to latest and greatest. On pressing PAUSE it would show a still frame but never moving ones on PLAY. I had no choice whatsoever but to rip the whole thing to an emensely huge MKV file and watch it on my 52-inch Panasonic plasma screen using my PC and the VLC software. Once I did that it was great, but what a bother.<br /><br />Of secondary annoyance is that while it's in the original English (my native language) it comes with subtitles ONLY for Dutch. Being rather iffy of hearing during scenes where there is background noise, music and such I very like to have English subtitles also available. So does my wife. So aside from having to rip the video to MKV it was further necessary to hunt, download and slightly edit an SRT file to get English subtitles to display (again via VLC).<br /><br />So, all in all, I'm glad to now have this wonderful show in full 1080p via a BluRay edition now that the bother is done with, had I known it would be so much trouble I really would have made due with a plain DVD in its place.

B002BGA7WM|5.0|While I harbour suspicions that it may, in fact, be the secret lovechild of Muse, Placebo, and Kiyoharu, this does not negate from the absolute perfection that is this album. You should count yourself fortunate to live in an universe where this album exists. See that parallel universe over there? (No you don't, you're lying.) THEY do not have this album. Look at them. Museless.<br /><br />Listen to this. It is good for you.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book could not get any better. It is very unique and I would recommend the book to anyone who loves touching and meaningful stories. I am so happy for the main character Charlie because he has learned what it is like to be a freshman in high school. Charlie has been through misunderstandings, drugs, sex, fears, and life lessons, but his two best friends, Patrick and Sam, taught him everything he needed to know about getting through it all. The best part is they would get through it  together because they felt infinite.
B00DCRE83S|2.0|Being an only-early-years-Metallica fan and a long time heavy metal fan, I just needed to have this album. Let me just say:<br /><br />Regarding the music (meaning the instruments) and the melodies, I have no complaints. Love the guitar work, drums, etc.<br />Regarding the vocal(s), I must agree with some other peoples reviews.... it tends to work on your nerves if you plan to listen to the complete album at once<br />But regarding the lyrics ..... oh come on ....<br /><br />Obviously, it is rather common for some lines to return in a song, like in the chorus. But on this album EVERY song has a couple of lines that are being repeated over and over and over and over and over again. It feels really inspirationless. Was there really no other word to rhyme with, so J. decided to just repeat it a couple of times and some couple of times more?<br /><br />Overall, this album is really not a bad attempt, but I think it could have been better. I am convinced J. has way more potential than this!
0439023513|1.0|Once the book would get to an exciting part Katniss would pass out and not remember what happened when she woke up. Generci way to end the story as well. I did not like this book at all.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Not quite as good as 1 and 2 but still passable. My six yr.old liked it. Waiting on next Avengers.
B0025KVLRO|4.0|Not being a huge Beatles fan, I'd like to think I can look at the Beatles LPs with a less biased view than maybe someone who is truly obsessed. I tend to like the lesser know album cuts rather than the big hits and I am also not afraid to challenge some of their more unassailable recordings. `Please Please Me' is a very good opening album but it is not what some classic rock fanatics would find entirely satisfying. It does attempt to bridge the gap between fifties era rock n' roll with the more serious and introspective classic rock era of which the band was of course of the most important contributors in this transformation of popular music.  There is much on the Beatles' first LP that is not what most people would call rock music, pop most definitely. They were, at this early stage, master mimics of multiple pop formats and the budding Lennon-McCartney songwriting was starting to add to the legend as eight of the songs are self-penned. Favorites for me include `Anna', `Boys' and `Twist and Shout' which are all covers. Some of the more famous songs such as `I Saw Her Standing There' and the title song are also ones I prefer and again  it is all very good but just don't go expecting all straight up rock music.  Again, this may be some fan's all-time favorite but for me, the Beatles would only improve as each subsequent LP would top its predecessor (for the most part).
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|I've been a fan of Alter Bridge since One Day Remains in 2004. The band's Sophomore effort Blackbird, is one of my favorite CDs of all time. Alter Bridge III was a solid CD but lacked some of the more melodic songs and lyrics of Blackbird so I was really excited when the early mentions of Fortress stated it would equal Blackbird. When I first listened to Fortress, I realized it's nothing like Blackbird. It's much heavier, but there is no denying the amazing four musicians have reached a new level with Fortress all of it's own. Myles Kennedy is not only amazing on vocals, his guitars can be appreciated on this CD on par with Mark Tremonti's searing solos. Mark takes his turn at vocals on one song as well. Flip's drums, and Brian Marshall on the bass also show the level of expertise the band members have reached on all of their other projects, but seem to shine the most combined as the supergroup Alter Bridge has become. The lyrics are still beautiful along with the harder sound, a stand out vocally would be Calm the Fire. Myles vocal range is also evident in the his lower range on the slowest track on the CD, Lover, with an eerie tone that's somehow hard not to love. It's hard to find a favorite track but Cry of Achilles seems to have every element intertwined that makes this band simply the best rock band currently releasing new material. All of the musicians in Alter Bridge can succeed in any project they attempt, but together, they can create a masterpiece like Fortress.
159463176X|5.0|Hosseini has done it again!  Although I liked Kite Runner even better, this is a close second.  So many characters, so real and so easy to keep track of.

B004X6PRO6|5.0|Powerful, insightful, but disturbing.  Very well written.  Insights to not just North Korea, but also to how such extremely despotic governments create such depravity and servile populations.  But the depravity and cruelty disturbed me greatly and made this a difficult book to read.
B00BZAJMWG|4.0|My wife and I really liked the movie. Every actor did a great job. Uplifting ending. Interesting treatment of a tough subject.

B003F3PMYI|5.0|I can't remember who told me to read Shawn Anchor's The Happiness Advantage: The Seven Principles that Fuel Success and Performance at Work, but I am glad they did.<br /><br />A Harvard University professor cum consultant, Anchor provides a delightful romp through the key concepts and experiments about positive psychology.<br /><br />It's easy to read - I consumed it in an afternoon on the back deck while basking in the sun on Prince Edward Island.  The harder part is in the application.<br /><br />Anchor outlines 7 principles to leading a happy life and then gives you great ideas on how to increase your happiness.  Some I do already (yeah!) and some I think I can build into a daily ritual:<br />- Exercise one of my signature strengths on a daily basis.<br />- Share three good things with my husband, Joe, at the beginning of every day.<br />- Lower the barriers to change by making the desired behavior more accessible and in the path of least resistance.<br /><br />I was particularly struck by how important social connections are to one's happiness.  In times of stress, we tend to hunker down when we should really be connecting with others!

B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Anyone who loves hard rock/metal should give this a spin. Easily the album of the year and it isn't close. Great from start to finish as it hits quickly and keeps on hitting, closing with two of the best songs on the CD in All Ends Well and Fortess. There are no fillers! After my first listen I was blown away. In my opinion as a whole this topped Blackbird and I did not think that was possible.
B000SW16LC|5.0|This is such a wonderful traditional movie that the entire family can enjoy.  Very heart warming fills you with holiday cheer.

B00BB3UYS8|5.0|My Review of Brandt Legg's 'Outview.'<br /><br />Nathan Ryder has a gift he calls a curse. In his dreams, he goes back in time to view incidents through the eyes of others; usually dying in the process. At first, he seems to be a teenaged version of Billy Pilgrim in Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five, but he soon realizes there's more to his powers than just the realistic nightmares. Over the course of the novel, Nathan and his three friends (Kyle, Lihn, and Amber) find out his dead father was part of a military experiment and there are others like him all over the world. Auras, energy vortexes, the CIA, and even Anasazi Indians soon come into play.<br /><br />The novel starts out like a YA tale but, as it progresses, ends like an adult paranormal story. Outview is similar to an epic journey where Nathan slowly finds out his destiny and, despite the obstacles, perseveres until he finds his way. The first third of the book is slow-going at times, but gathers steam until the appropriate ending. Three-dimensional characters, a complex plot, and dynamic dialogue makes this a five star novel.
B00AGH5LF6|5.0|This is a wonderful movie for the entire family.  Not a dull moment in the entire movie. It will make you laugh out loud.  Joe Pecsi  hilarious.

B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I got one of these after a friend told me about it and I love it. I don't know what I was expecting, but it really has got my mood focused on keeping track of my daily exercise, weight, sleep, etc.<br />At first I thought it was going to be hard to set up with my phone but after I realized I was just doing it wrong (I've never used Bluetooth before) I was able to pair this to my phone and now it does what it needs to do with one push of the button on my Pulse it syncs up all the info and then I can look at it on my phone whenever I want. It has multiple info displays you can tab through on the Pulse itself but I haven't spent much time figuring them out yet, I use the Withings app on my Samsung SIII (Android phone).<br />I really like that I can monitor my sleep as well as the walking and weight. I tend to have a hard time falling or staying asleep, and to see the stats that it actually doesn't take me as long as it feels.. that was interesting. Plus, the actual amount of sleep, deep sleep vs light sleep and the bit of time I'm awake getting up to use the bathroom, it's all there and just neat to see.<br />The next step will be making changes to my habits so that I can improve all the areas I am now actually seeing my patterns for. I've found I am walking more, I'm even thinking about taking up running again. The idea that this product has really changed my though process and put me more \\"in the mood\\" to be healthier is something I wasn't expecting but am so thankful for. Changes in my sleep environment that I can see if they help me get better sleep or not, is amazing because I have always struggled with getting good sleep.<br />All in all, not enough good things to say about this, I just love it.

0440237688|5.0|Lois Lowry's The Giver is the story of a boy named Jonas who lives in a community that functions<br />within itself and is separated from the rest of the world. The community strives to provide people<br />with a \\"perfect life\\" in which there is absolutely no pain, worry, war, or inequality. Peoples' lives are<br />dictated in every way from what their job is in the community, to who they marry and even how many<br />children they have (one boy and one girl). Citizens must take a pill every day that inhibits them from<br />experiencing true emotions. They are not able to feel grief, depression, or suffering. However, they are<br />not able to experience positive, life defining emotions either, like love.<br /><br />When Jonas turns twelve, he is assigned the most important job in the community, The Receiver<br />of Memories. It is his burden to learn about the truth of the world and the secrets of the past that only<br />one person, The Giver, knows. As Jonas learns about life outside of his \\"perfect community\\" and how<br />things used to be, he comes to realize that the way they are living now is not perfect at all and decides<br />he needs to change.<br /><br />The Giver plays on the classic idea of breaking free from the constraints of conformed living<br />and learning what it really means to live. It radiates a powerful message that reminds us of the beauty<br />in individuality and freedom. As peoples' lives nowadays continue to revolve more and more around<br />technology, money, and work, The Giver is a literary breath of fresh air that will stay with you for a long<br />time.
B000P6PVLC|5.0|this is a deep story about how miscommunication and misunderstanding can create profound impact that is undesired. It is about misconceptions and misunderstandings and how they affect us all, east, west and in between. And sometimes we are driven to draw fast wrong conclusions and build upon them. It is a message to slow down because it is much faster to do so in order to understand.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I learned from a YouTuber that there were two different versions of this Littlest Pet Shop app; the version on this app featured the TV Show version of the main character, a human named Blythe from the 2012 TV Series, Littlest Pet Shop from the Hub Network.<br /><br />That was probably to help promote that TV Show, but I think it worked well.<br /><br />Anyways, this is, without a doubt, a fun game. It actually simple; you help Blythe and her Pet Shop Pet Friends to take care of some pets who come to the LPS TO take up residence, and hang out.<br /><br />You get help from the seven main pets, Zoe, Pepper, Vinnie, Minka, Sunil, Russel and my favorite, a panda named Penny Ling.<br /><br />The way they look in the Kindle Tablet Version, especially Blythe, almost look the same as they do in the 2012 TV Series, but only Zoe & Minka loom different; Zoe has no hat on her hat in this version, and Minka seems to be wearing a skirt, which she DOESN'T wear at all in the show.<br /><br />When you collect money in this game, the payment you collect here is named kibble, and their jewelry that you pay with in this is called bling.<br /><br />Like the MLP app, the downside to getting either kibble, or bling, or even both, they cost money. And you to manage, and spend your money wisely.<br /><br />Despite that, all in all, this is one Pet Shop you probably will never want to leave. Why pick one Pet when you can pick them all?<br /><br />4 out of 5 stars, and an 8.5 out of 10 for the Littlest Pet Shop game app.<br /><br />Forget Man's Best Friend. These are EVERYONE's best friends. ;)<br /><br />UPDATE: This updated version has you trying to help Blythe & the Pets to save Littlest Pet Shop now; similar to the plot of the 2-Part pilot, \\"Blythe's Big Adventure\\" from Season 1. I think that's pretty cool.

B00BATKPBE|5.0|The British system, with its castes, private schools, and the intimacy of an intellectual class concentrated in London and the not-at-all distant Oxford means that important people know each other. More than that, they marry one another. Dawkins recitation of his genealogy reminds me of that of Charles Darwin, the Huxley's, the Mill family and other comfortable middle-class families that managed to spawn generation after generation of bright and/or brilliant minds. Francis Galton, the scion of one such family, wrote a book entitled Hereditary Genius in which he documented the phenomenon in family after family.<br /><br />Dawkins knows his lineage going back at least to the 16th century, and it is a mixture of minor nobility, people of distinction one way or another, a scoundrel here and there, but generally a quite good class of people. Though he says his parents never had a great deal of money, their habits of mind were of people who had the conviction that they mattered. One of the many delights of the book are the illustrations. Dawkins has a number of pictures of his childhood, and even out of his parents' and grandparents' childhoods. Many were posed in a way that makes you think they had the conviction that posterity would be interested in them. I offer this observation, as my American ancestors were probably similarly capable, but had a quite different view on life. As an American, I am unusual in that I know their names, but unlike Dawkins, I do not know their biographies. He comes from a unique and one might call privileged tradition. It comes with a noblesse oblige, a sense of obligation to accomplish something, and that is what Dawkins has done extraordinarily well.<br /><br />Running an Empire required the best and brightest of British society, and Dawkins' parents and grandparents were involved in the colonial administrations of India and Africa. His account of his childhood in Africa is idyllic. Although he does not make conscious mention of the relationship with the native peoples, it comes through very clearly that the British were accepted as natural masters. They had a kind of paternalistic affection for the people who work for them, and in turn felt no fear traveling alone on the dirt roads connecting the far-flung settlements of East Africa.<br /><br />Dawkins has a delightful gift for telling it like it is. His account is unfiltered, apparently as good as recollection can make it. He talks about bullying in the private schools he attended in a fairly matter-of-fact way. It existed - yes. It could be incredibly cruel. He confesses his shame in not defending his weaker classmates. Yet, he can see that the culture which supported bullying also seems to have brought out some of the better aspects of some people's natures. One may be a better person for having endured a bit of hazing.<br /><br />The British schools of Dawkins youth also had corporal punishment. His account tallies with my recollections from California. There may have been sadists among the administration, but I never encountered them, and it seemed to me that most of the people who received punishment deserved it one way or another and survived just fine. It was one of many devices that the school administration used to maintain their authority. Students also dressed more or less appropriately, as young gentleman in formation rather than above-it-all louts.<br /><br />Homosexuality was also a fixture in British private schools. Dawkins writes matter-of-factly of the masters and the older boys who came on to him, and also of the civil way in which they accepted his rejections. He makes the observation that when there are no women around, highly sexed young men are likely to turn to whatever is available. This refreshingly commonsensical observation is strongly at odds with current orthodoxies, which tend to paint homosexuality as an all or nothing, inborn orientation. Again, this tallies with my observations growing up in California. I regret tosay that nubile young women never came on to me, but gays frequently did. However, they always took \\"no\\" for an answer. I'm glad not to have endured prolonged arguments about how uptight and abnormal I was.<br /><br />Dawkins became aware of his interest in his talents while enrolled in Balliol College in Oxford. Actually, he spent most of his time not at the college but the university, a distinction which is rather lost on me but important to him. He was fortunate to have a genius mentor, later to be Nobel prize winner Niko Tinbergen. He mentions a number of very gifted men with an interest in teaching. There especially credits the course of instruction, which did not follow any fixed curriculum, but instead had students read PhD theses and other up-to-the-minute papers to learn the state-of-the-art in their fields of study, and then discuss it. This has always been one of the hallmarks of the major centers of learning: great minds come together, they encourage, excite, and correct one another.<br /><br />One of the things the great minds also do is come in conflict with one another. Dawkins is very sparing with his discussion of academic disputes, mentioning only one between Tinbergen and the American Lardner, in which he puts most of the emphasis on the reconciliation and the ability of the men to work together. They were not reconciled to the American Marxist biologists from Harvard, Richard Lewontin and Steven Rose. These were colleagues of Stephen Jay Gould, at Harvard, and by all reports are willing to put their political beliefs above their scientific integrity.<br /><br />The last autobiographical entry in the book is his publication of The Selfish Gene in 1975. He had the idea, received a lot of encouragement and support from his colleagues, actually had publishers chasing him for a first book, and was expresses pleasant surprise that it turned out to be as successful as it was. He was also surprised that the thesis turned out to be so controversial. Within the world of academics, it had seemed rather obvious.<br /><br />Dawkins's final chapter is an assessment of his life and accomplishments. He acknowledges that he was very favorably positioned, with two biologists as parents. The childhood in Africa may as well have been an asset, though he cannot say. As I noted in my introductory paragraph, I think that he benefited considerably from family history. He had some illustrious ancestors, and there was no doubt some expectation that he would do something of note with his own life.<br /><br />Dawkins assesses his gifts. His quite good at picking up music, not very good at all that reading it. He is not a terribly astute observer. He claims never to have mastered higher math, although he turned out to be a genius programmer, a skill which most people would say is closely related. He appears to have benefited from his congeniality, easy-going nature and good looks.<br /><br />We know that it takes a certain intelligence, probably measurable, to turn out prose as lucid as his books. It takes a collegiality, a level of curiosity, and a great deal of hard work to conduct experiments such as he did during his early research. This brings us to his computer programming, which he undertook just about the very moment that computers became available. I am a programmer, not a bad one, and I stand in awe of the matter-of-fact account that he gives of the things he programmed.  He programmed a couple of compilers, a computer language translating program, and a number of real-time applications before the word real-time had even been invented. The Selfish Gene focuses more than had I thought that it should have on computer programming. I now understand why, and understand that the algorithms he described in that book were of scientific interest, but from a data processing point of view, other things he was doing at the same time probably demanded greater intellect. In any case, I am impressed.<br /><br />Dawkins is perhaps best known as an atheist. Only a bit of that comes through. He talks quite a bit about the Anglican influence on his childhood, and the passion reflected in his atheism may be a mirror of the passionate belief to which he was exposed as a child. One of the things I like about this book in previous books is his quotation of poetry and especially hymns. The foreword of one of his other books - I don't remember which - included the great Anglican hymn: \\"Time like an ever rolling stream bears all for sons away. They die forgotten as a dream dies at the break of day.\\"<br /><br />I will close with a wry note. His entire thesis is that we are self replicators, and that everything that we do inclines us to reproduce ourselves. Why doesn't he see how important religion is in this? He need look no further than Robert Trivers, who wrote the introduction to The Selfish Gene.  Irrationality is an important part of our nature. In particular, when it comes to reproduction, having children does nothing of benefit to the phenotype. Children are expensive both in terms of cash and time. Why would anybody have them? It is an irrational act. Precisely. And it takes the kind of irrationality generally called religion. I would ask that Dawkins at least investigate the fact that it is a paradox. However much religion cannot be proven, it may be essential to our survival. And if he wants his own progeny to someday glance admiringly at their handsome and accomplished progenitor, he should probably have kinder words for Anglicanism.in the world of academics, it had seemed rather obvious.<br /><br />Dawkins's final chapter is an assessment of his life and accomplishments. He acknowledges that he was very favorably positioned, with two biologists as parents. The childhood in Africa may as well have been an asset, though he cannot say.

He talks quite a bit about the Anglican influence on his childhood, and the passion reflected in his atheism may be a mirror of the passionate belief to which he was exposed as a child. One of the things I like about this book in previous books is his quotation of poetry and especially hymns. The foreword of one of his other books - I don't remember which - included the great Anglican hymn: \\"Time like an ever rolling stream bears all for sons away. They die forgotten as a dream dies at the break of day.\\"<br /><br />I will close with a wry note. His entire thesis is that we are self replicators, and that everything that we do inclines us to reproduce ourselves. Why doesn't he see how important religion is in this? He need look no further than Robert Trivers, who wrote the introduction to The Selfish Gene.  Irrationality is an important part of our nature. In particular, when it comes to reproduction, having children does nothing of benefit to the phenotype. Children are expensive both in terms of cash and time. Why would anybody have them? It is an irrational act. Precisely. And it takes the kind of irrationality generally called religion. I would ask that Dawkins at least investigate the fact that it is a paradox. However much religion cannot be proven, it may be essential to our survival. And if he wants his own progeny to someday glance admiringly at their handsome and accomplished progenitor, he should probably have kinder words for Anglicanism.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have to say that I have been reading at least 2-3 books a month for years and this is at the top of my list as a must read. I also read Sharp objects, which is also by the same author. This book has the best jaw dropping turn arounds and loops. It is absolutely addicting.
B006RXQ1L6|5.0|One of the truly GREAT movies ever made. John C. Riley is perhaps the highlight of the whole film.  Even if you don't care for musicals, this is far from it!
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|I have loved all three of these stories and it is just as good as the first, just buy it.
B004NS710C|3.0|Pretty inaccurate movie, but very very well filmed.  I could care one way or the other about Denzel W. or the New Capt. Kirk.  If I didn't love trains I wouldn't have looked twice
B008KYOCA2|4.0|I like viewing a whole month on one screen and like that I can see an event without having to &#34;click&#34;on it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|There are limited applications this will work with at the moment, but that will all change once this is out for a while. Easy to setup and use. The apps that are able to be used, have a button to stream it to the Chromecast and it only takes a second for it to flip from the device to TV. $35 is a great price for this as it will only get better with time.
B000FC10MU|2.0|A lot of digressions not really relevant to the plot and dull characters made it a poor reading experience. Plot is good though.
B004EIZCPM|4.0|Despite looking pretty much like every other teen comedy out there (at least on the cover), \\"Easy A\\" seems to be a fairly ambitious movie.  It wants to be a modern adaptation of \\"The Scarlet Letter,\\" a classic novel that is nonetheless a rather difficult read and has been butchered in transition to the big screen before.  It also seems to be trying to be a homage to the John Hughes teen movies of the '80s, making references and even using scenes from said movies (especially \\"Sixteen Candles,\\" \\"The Breakfast Club,\\" and \\"Ferris Beuller's Day Off\\").  But above all it seems to want to make a statement and offer commentary on sexuality... and how women, teen girls especially, are held to a different sort of standard than men and teen boys.  And all while being a funny and entertaining flick.  Quite a large bite for a single movie to chew.<br /><br />Does \\"Easy A\\" succeed at its multiple aims?  Well... mostly.  But even where it falls short, it's still an enjoyable movie, and definitely one that keeps you thinking after the credits have rolled.<br /><br />Olive Penderghast is a virtual nobody at her California high school, invisible to most of the school save Rhiannon, her hyperactive best friend who's sort of a jerk, and Todd, an old crush who now plays the school's mascot.  When she fibs her way out of a camping trip with Rhiannon's weird parents, Rhiannon misinterprets her recap of the weekend to imply that she lost her virginity, and ends up spreading the news throughout the school.  Soon Olive is seen as the school slut, a reputation she doesn't exactly help herself when she starts offering to pretend to sleep with guys to help them improve their social standing (including a rather hilarious scene where she pretends to sleep with a classmate at a party to rebuff rumors that he's gay).  At first she accepts her sudden notoriety, even if it's for the wrong reasons... but soon comes to realize that the attention she's getting is destroying her and others, especially when the local Christian fundamentalists set their sights on her and when a philandering school counselor sides against her.  Can she set things right, and salvage some of her mangled reputation in the process?<br /><br />The parallels between \\"Easy A\\" and \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" are fairly obvious, and even referenced throughout the film (with a few potshots taken at the lousy '90s film adaptation).  Whether this works for the viewer is really up to them, and personally I found the film probably could have stood better on its own merits instead of claiming to be an adaptation.<br /><br />That aside, however, this is still a fairly solid movie, with decent acting all around.  Emma Stone is wonderful as the delightfully snarky Olive, keeping her head high and wicked humor intact even as her world comes crumbling down around her.  Her family was quite enjoyable as well, not feeling forced or corny like so many families in teen movies, and with some of the most hilarious parents ever.  Amanda Bynes plays a rather ironic role as the ringleader of the local Christian group, and is an interesting blend of annoyingly perky and backstabbingly evil.  Most of the male roles in this movie, even Woodchuck Todd, are fairly bland and forgettable, sadly, with only Thomas Haden Church as a funny English teacher and Malcolm McDowell as the hardnosed, homophobic principal standing out.<br /><br />The film itself is quite enjoyable, funny throughout but also being touching and emotional when it needs to be -- though an attempted date-rape scene in the latter third of the film is rather jarring and can break one out of the lighthearted mood of the rest of the film.  The film isn't afraid to poke fun at itself or at the clich&eacute;s of its genre -- Olive even bemoans that her life isn't more like a John Hughes movie -- and many teens will probably find certain facts true to life, such as how quickly rumors can spread and mutate.  It also deconstructs and explores the double-standard regarding sexuality and virginity -- men increase their social standing in this film by claiming they slept with Olive, while Olive herself is demonized as a \\"slut\\" after a single one-night stand, even before she starts allowing men to claim they slept with her.<br /><br />If I have any nitpicks with the film, it's that once again Christians are typecast as stubborn, arrogant, and ignorant, to the point where they serve as the primary antagonists of the movie.  And of course, the film is quick to point them out as hypocrites -- one joins the fight to \\"save\\" Olive from her \\"wicked ways,\\" only to contract chlamydia from having an affair with the school guidance counselor.  People, not all Christians are as judgmental and self-important as this film makes them out to be.<br /><br />Nitpicks aside, however, this is a fun, mostly lighthearted film, one that isn't afraid to tackle a bigger issue and actually manages to do it competently without getting bogged down in a \\"moral\\" of any sort.  It's not anything earth-shattering, but it's a step up from most teen comedy fare and a good deal cleaner than most despite the subject matter.  Probably best for ages 14 and up due to language, sexual references, and at least one drug reference.uality and virginity -- men increase their social standing in this film by claiming they slept with Olive, while Olive herself is demonized as a \\"slut\\" after a single one-night stand, even before she starts allowing men to claim they slept with her.<br /><br />If I have any nitpicks with the film, it's that once again Christians are typecast as stubborn, arrogant, and ignorant, to the point where they serve as the primary antagonists of the movie.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|I found this went too slow in places and wandered toward no given conclusion.  I do hope the next novel ensures Jon Snow doesn't die.  He held the entire novel together.  I give it four stars only because it didn't hold its plot tight in various places.
B00EP0KYDO|5.0|I really love it.  Thank you I will purchase more movies in the future.  Keep up the good work .....
B00F91SCXC|3.0|It was ok. obviously nothing like the book. Brad was going, going, going, going, going, and then the movie ended.  Cool CG.
B009ERK1T0|4.0|Releasing an album two years after a previous one is an absolute treat from these guys. We waited a whole 4 years for diamond eyes and it was a great return for them. Deftones come back again with a very solid album that I think is slightly better than diamond eyes. It's a bit of a darker and more ambient album. Deftones always have that dark vibe but while I feel diamond eyes was a great summer album, KNY is a great fall or winter album. It's got a bit of everything for all fans. Some heavier tracks, some more progressive and some slow and beautiful. I'm hoping to hear from these guys soon because they seem to be getting better with age.
B001NLKZUA|3.0|don't get me wrong I enjoyed the book and the one preceding and I will most likely continue to enjoy the rest of the series, but I find that this book was definetly more boring. It drags. . , now what I must say towards the title . . . . &#34;is it me?&#34;  is that I find that the last few series I have read, the second book was lacking appeal. . .  boring! {i.e. Twilight (New Moon was dreadful and I really like the Jacob character and . . .BODY! hee hee) I find that the need for author to remind of us what happened in the first book . . .slightly insulting! HERE NOR THERE!. . . I will continue to read the series.. Now, if the next is the same I may just wait for the movie.

B00BSBUZT6|5.0|My favorite group of all time . I pre bought this product and couldn't wait for it to show up. You won't be disappointed if you like the Eagles
B00E6Z0THE|3.0|it's an ok game but there is far far far too much back and forth and round and round for me. I guess I am looking for more of something along the lines of &#34;The Room&#34; where you are in a more stationary setting and can focus on clues and solving the puzzle instead of running all over god's green earth trying to remember where you saw what and what relevance it had to which other thing you saw and forgot about because you were busy running around the planet. They could have done better with clues as well as there are slightly more than none to go by. I still play it sometimes, but it takes too much patience and I really have to feel like frustrating vs. entertaining my self to get back to it.

I have only used it a half-dozen times or so and I'm not familiar with other program features, but it's obvious to me that a great deal of real thought went into its design, development and implementation.

B008SAZHLQ|5.0|It's a wonderful book. It's teenage romance told just perfectly. So real, so sweet, so heartbreaking... This book will surely win an award. Or has it already? Read it.
B00124PXW8|4.0|The classic horror movie. Any fan of the genre loves this film. No need for modern effect and make up to make this better.
B00D1XDISY|5.0|I really enjoy the Iron man movies. There's just the right balance of character development, technology, angst, desperation and humor. Robert Downey Jr. is good in the part, giving Tony Stark enough charisma and humanity that allows us to forgive him his faults.<br /><br />Nice eye candy all the way around.
1848507836|5.0|It is the best book that I've ever read that proves medically and scientifically that life exists after the death of the body, and that the soul is not dependent on the brain for its existence. Ms. Moorjani left all of her medical records open for researchers to study. This book changed my life. I have given it to about 30 people.

0345803485|5.0|Great read! Shared it with many friends and colleagues. I can't imagine how they'll do the film though??!! BUT I will go to watch it for sure.
0547978847|1.0|\\"Anything essential is invisible to the eyes.\\"<br />~Ouch.<br /><br />I have no idea why anyone would tamper with Katherine Woods' original translation, which held up fine for 50 years.  In a classroom setting, it would be interesting to use this to compare excerpts to the Woods' translation and then to the original French.  I don't think it would be the classic it is if this were the original translation, at least not in English.<br /><br />In short, it does for translation what Disney did for illustration on Winnie the Pooh..
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|The app. on my tv could be faster (might just be my internet connection)Needs to have a que for movies that i had to stop in the middle and need to pick up later. i had to use the search engine to find the movie to resume,its a little time consuming when you have to type with a remote.but in all it worked very well.
B00004Z400|5.0|Great clean CD to give a woman a taste of me. Now you will know I love music that rules!
B00B0ND67K|5.0|I don't usually gush at new albums - but this one is an instant classic in many ways. Everyone knows the musicianship of Kenny Loggins - a true singer/songwriter and consummate performer. Many are not as familiar with the work of Georgia Middleman and Gary Burr.  The trio make up Blue Sky Riders.  Every song on the record hit all the right marks. The energy level here aims for the top, the vocals/harmonies are impeccable (heavenly actually), and the arrangements are almost organically crafted.  I have listened to the album about 30 times so far and the next listen will be as great as the first.<br />-ddw
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like having my books anywhere I am on all my devices, phone, tablet, computer. And I really like that Amazon doesn't force me to buy their tablet in order to enjoy their service.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This is filth. Should not be allowed distribution as easy as on Amazon to Kindle users! Should be some sort of restriction as to who can get it down loaded.
0307887448|5.0|I'm not much of a reader, but I couldn't put this down. If you love 80's-90's nostalgia, computers, and video games, this is a must read. Can't wait for the movie.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|OK honestly this mouse is great! I've had it for about 6 months and it's comfy, though it does take a little getting used to all the buttons. Lots of customization EXCEPT... you can change the color of the LED ANKER symbol where your palm rests, but you CAN'T change the color of the middle mouse wheel... so basically if you don't have the color set to blue it looks kind of dumb. ALSO recently the middle mouse wheel button has started malfunctioning and sends out multiple signals each time I click it which is SUPER annoying when you use it to open a new tab and it opens 3-4. Tried contacting ANKER 3 times (all you can do on their website in the support section is email them). After sending an email a message pops up that they will contact you in 2 days AND THEY NEVER DO. I'm just lucky something more serious didn't break I guess.<br /><br />EDIT/ UPDATE: All right folks so ANKER saw this review and contacted me immediately apologizing that they missed my emails because they are currently migrating their system for the next couple of weeks. They immediately shipped me a new mouse and sent me a label to return my old mouse. I couldn't be more happy and I highly recommend these folks. Very satisfied!

0316743305|5.0|I loved this book!  It tickled my history fancy and my curiosity about how our best and brightest' did acquisition in the past.  We are so mired in government oversight regulations today, that I fear for our future procurement capability!  If you work in military procurement or government weapons systems acquisition (as do I), then you need to read this book to see &#34;how they did it,&#34; because we sure as heck cannot do today what these guys did just a few decades ago! (But we could if we throttled back the &#34;Bureaucratic Beast&#34; that has become our current acquisition system!).
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|If you don't know about Duolingo, you should probably research it some.  It is so much more than a way to learn a new language for free.  This is a top quality program that will teach you to speak a major language in the style of Rosetta Stone.  It isn't exactly like Rosetta Stone and there aren't nearly as many languages, but it is free AND it is for a good cause.  The back story on Duolingo is that once you have reached a specific level of ability, you actually begin to translate books and websites.  You see, computers are really not very good at translation, but people are.  Once you are proficient enough, you will be translating actual webpages.  Your translation will be compared with hundreds of others to find what is correct (computers are good at this part).  Don't believe me?  Go to Duoling dot com and check it out.  Not only will you pick up a super helpful skill but you will give back to humanity at the same time.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Once again Stephen King has done it! I love this book. The way he brings you up to date on Danny while introducing you to new characters as well as bringing past family members back to life. STEPHEN KING has and always will be my favorite author!  Thank you!

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|When a reader loves a book they often never want the story to end. I was happy to revisit poor little Danny Torrance from THE SHINING!  I love the new characters as I love all King characters.  Another mind bending story that keeps you enthralled to the last word.  I'll never think about campers and motor homes the same way again....or top hats for that matter!

B005CGI4EG|4.0|This is a great deal for the complete series, as long as you don't mind the packaging. All of the discs are clumped together and placed on a giant spindle. If I had known that the packaging was this way, I may not have bought it, but none the less it is a great show! Glad that I own the complete set & can go back & re-live the series at any time, not just in reruns at 6am. :)

B00F91RYL8|1.0|This is kind of a mess. The casting esp for the little girl was poor. The whole thing about zombie hordes that cannot be killed really stretches the zombie thing way out.<br /><br />The vaccine this is well stupid. The plane crash where he has a hunk of shrapnel through his gut and walks for miles and is up and around in no time invokes the \\"Optional Super Solider Rule\\"<br /><br />Using Sat phones indoors too ! Oh brother<br /><br />The anti zombie weapon of choice was no where to be seen

B00ECR7KX2|1.0|I am a big Joss Whedon fan. I loved Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Dr. Horrible, Cabin in the Woods (but not Dollhouse). And I love Shakespeare, so I really had high hopes going into this. But I'm sorry to say this is a mediocre adaptation at best. The actors (most of whom I have enjoyed in other parts) are not at all convincing here. And there was just no real chemistry between Benedick and Beatrice. It has been said that Shakespeare needs to be performed, not read. For the most part, I felt like this was simply a reading.<br /><br />Also the contemporary setting is an unnecessary distraction that adds nothing to the plot, and seems more like a gimmick - likewise the decision to shoot in black and white.<br /><br />If I could give stars for risk-taking I would. I admire the guts it took to shoot a feature-length film at Whedon's home in only 12 days. Unfortunately that risk did not pay off, and I must judge the film on its own merits.<br /><br />If you want to see \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" as it should be done, stick with the Kenneth Branagh version. There's simply no comparison.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Given the teen/tween hype, I did not expect this film to be as well done as it was.  As a middle age Science Fiction fan of 35 years or so, I liked it!
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Billy is brilliant. What a character. The stats get a mention but mainly its a fast moving yarn about the characters in baseball management and Billy's wheeling and dealing. How important it is to have an appreciation of the true underlying indicators of a baseball player's skill and ability; of having a deep understanding of other Managers' drivers and character; of the overall importance of having chutzpah. Read this, be amazed and have a good laugh.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|This book was terrible. I guessed the \\"secret\\" about 15% of the way through the book, and for the remainder of the book, I was just waiting for the damn thing to be over. The writing isn't good, the characters are shallow and predictable, and the Christian themes hit you over the head like a ton of loaves and fishes. Not worth it!
B000JMKNZQ|5.0|Totally awesome  ! A source of Inspiration ! One of the best books I have ever read. !!! I have gifted to several of my family and friends and each one of them has loved it !
B00FEHXISA|2.0|I enjoyed the first and second Iron Man movie but I can't understand what all the hype is about with the third movie.  Was Iron Man really even in the third movie?  He spent more time trying to get in the suit then he did actually wearing the suit.  I am still trying to figure out why this movie made so much money at the box office.  I am also trying to figure out why the ctritics loved this movie and hated man of steel.  Everyone said this movie was better than Man Of Steel.  I felt Man Of Steel was 10 times better than this movie which is why I saw MOS twice in the theater.  I like Iron Man just like every one else here.  I have watched the first and second movie many times.  Iron Man was the highlight of the Avengers movie and I watched that several times as well.  The third Iron Man movie will only be watched once!
B002ECQB46|5.0|I truly LOVE this movie. It had suspense, drama, and some action. Please watch this movie. I can watch this movie over and over again.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Was very helpful.  Wasn't too fancy, but it had a lot of very helpful features.  I would recommend getting this app.
B005F3DG80|1.0|same as the other review.  Does not work and had no idea I was purchasing the wrong disc format.  Purchased before the other review was posted, waited too long to try it, now am screwed.  Lesson learned.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|this is an awesome cd and an awesome band. people with negative reviews need to get a life. the songs are great sounds like thier begining sound with some evolution sound wise.buy it yesterday. hard driving fast charged up sounds. yeah
B001NTJV6G|5.0|I can't get enough of Miss Badu. I can listen to her all day long. This 1st album she put out was the beginning of the Badu Movement that I will always be a part of, even with that changes that come along the way.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This seemingly simple game is addicting. Once you start its hard to know when to quit. I've gotten some of the additional packs and have completed them as well.
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|this movie shows that even people that dont have a clue about life can achieve great things through heartache and disappointment<br />and total loss of the ones we love and yet somehow always come out on top! through shear collaboration and never giving up<br />it shows us that even in being told people who have learning disability are still better off than the smart ones!they do know what love is !!
B008VPDD6O|5.0|I enjoyed the last one a little more story wise but this one had some truly great 3d moments. The deaths were good with very nice 3d pop out and depth. I couldn't complain at all.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I love Lady antebellum and this new CD did not disappoint!  All the songs are very well done and the CD arrived without a hitch.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is a great product - easy to use and an improvement over prior versions. I highly recommend OfficeSuite Pro 7.
B00AW57L96|5.0|Even though this is a light read and certainly a chicks book it is thought provoking and has been a 'memorable' story.  A compelling and engaging story.
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|Go and watch the original cartoons then the new movies and see how far off the mark the movies are.  Just not right.  I don't like them at all.  Unbelievable.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|The movie itself is epic and how was restored is incredible. Amazing picture and sound. I think every intelligent human being has to have it
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I bought this movie collection because it is, in my opinion, one of the best movies ever. Need I say more...I dont think so!
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Hey, I love this show and it is the only other one I will buy before I can get it dirt cheap.
B00ANGICRE|4.0|John Hawkes was great, but don't forget Helen Hunt, she was very good and showed alot of compassion, Good Show!
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|An epic movie if you like pink Floyd and have not seen this then watch it now!!! This movie basically provides an in depth explanation of the story behind the cd the wall basically is a music video that goes along with thecd and is high quality for its time if you like pink Floyd and have not seen the wall it is a must for any pink Floyd fan tear down the wall and hear the true story behind pink.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Make sure you have frivolous money to spend, and almost two hours of your life you'll not wish to have back.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and so does my family! A friend showed it to me and I fell in love with it.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I love musicals! This one is not only a classic but it is a class act and one of my favorites.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|love everything that Ms Cromwell writes.  All of the main characters are so complex and fun to follow as they are aging.  Fun read
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|If you are looking for books for 5th or 4th graders, I would most definitely suggest this book to you. I love these type of books. They always tell you about how to react when you are bullied.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|This story illustrates the profound effect of therapy performed by sex surrogates. They are vital to the functioning of a healthy society but many people are unwilling to seek the help they need because of religious conditioning. Our society must recognize the contribution of every type of sex worker and end any stigma associated with these issues. I salute Helen Hunt for her honest portrayal of this true story.
B00CHOPEKI|5.0|Was extremely pleased with this Barbie and the delivery. She is dressed so well, loved the hairdo and pose. Will be looking to purchase her companion.
1603420398|4.0|Good book, great designs and illustrations. Close attention should be paid to instructions; some errors. Many projects from which to choose!
B004G7UTXG|4.0|DeNiro, Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons.  All give top notch performances.  The historical backdrop of Spain and Portugal dividing up huge chunks of South America and looking on the native population as little more than slaves to work the plantations gives nice depth to the movie.  But, the real story is one of redemption and faith that transcends politics.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|In reading some of the reviews, I have to wonder if we read the same book.  There are so many times where I was distracted from the actual story.  References to shows, history and other books was not the worst of it.  The characters are not developed very well and the relationships between the character seems to happen too fast that it doesn't make sense.  Many times their traits are inconsistent and it gets frustrating that you can't get an accurate picture of the person.  Grammar issues, repetitive phrases and mixing up the spelling of characters names is annoying.<br /><br />I was really disappointed with the story and will definitely not be reading more books.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For only $35 bucks how can you go wrong. I bough this the day it was released so I also got the Netflix code. Makes watching YouTube or any of the streaming sites fantastic. I only wish Amazon had an app to watch their streaming content.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|One of our favorite all-time series. Too bad the original actor passed away.<br /><br />Hard shoes to fill. But we think the producers did a good job with this new actor to play such an iconic hero.<br />The last season delivers the usual array of blood and guts and solid acting, a great balance that most of these types of shows lack.<br /><br />HBO's ROME series did much of the same. Although only 2 seasons, it was very memorable and well done. But STARZ picked up where HBO's ROME left off, delivering more action and bang for your buck.<br /><br />A must see and/or own.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I didn't have much hope for this movie prior to watching. I really enjoyed it despite my narrow expectations. Writing and acting were far superior to what I had anticipated.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is a fun but challenging logic game. On the S4 the controls are a little too close and I sometimes but the song button. Also the numbersare very small. Other than that, I couldn't put the game down.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very good read with interesting &#34;what ifs&#34; included! I loved the characters and all the twists and turns. Not a lot of romance, but a lot of real life.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|I love this show! So much! Won't play from amazon tv on my ipad to my tv through the hdmi adapter and the one click purchased screwed me, but still worth the $25 mess up.<br />Also tried to watch it on my sister's kindle, since licensing permits two devices, but wasn't able to.
0545615402|5.0|This box set release of the three \\"Hogwarts Library\\" titles is perfect for any Harry Potter collector or enthusiast. The box is solid, the textures are of the best quality. The books themselves are hard-bound with the \\"official\\" Hogwarts Library seal, all illustrations inside are retained from the originals with notes by \\"Professor Dumbledore\\" and J.K. Rowling. The author's signature adorns the box exterior and within one of the books (printed, not hand-signed). Not to mention, the contents within are fantastic - who doesn't love the tale of the three brother's?<br /><br />Collect reference guides mentioned within your beloved series. Relive the experience anew.<br /><br />The best collection of these three books I have seen to-date.
B002361MLA|4.0|The Power of Now is an Advanced read, but the ideas are brilliant. It delivers an eastern philosophy that we should all apply to our lives.
B00EDLP6O2|5.0|Love this game. It's what a sports lover has always dreamed of. It's hands down a great game for a low price right now
B003F44QRQ|5.0|I was first introduced to this movie when I was a kid. Better than the crap vampire movies out now.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Yesterday I downloaded 8 full movies and 30 music videos!  TubeMate worked flawlessly and so do the videos!  I highly recommend this app!
0767827791|5.0|Exceptionally fine performance by Rosalind Russell  as the aging teacher.  Wonderful Labor Day tradition in our family  I love this film.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|After an enjoyable season six, I personally thought Supernatural went off the rails in season seven. Thankfully, former writer Jeremy Carver was brought back to run the show, and I think he saved it. The writing is sharper and funnier, there's a renewed sense of purpose, and the mythology goes to a new (very interesting) place. There's numerous plot threads running through the entire season, and flashbacks are used in a very effective way. The DVD is great - there's three lengthy featurettes that include the cast/writers, three commentaries, and the standard gag reel. I haven't been this excited about the show since the Kripke era - highly recommended.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I can't believe I waited this long to watch it.  I highly recommend it, one of the best shows out there!!
B004ZGI2KK|3.0|It was a good movie but it just didn't grab my attention the way I was hoping it would.  I had a bad day at work and was looking forward to something taking my mind off my bad day and this just did not do it for me.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|Granted, I had this charger for about 4 months before it stopped working out of the blue, but it was only used a half dozen times.  After we called to see about a replacement, the company said it had been too long since we purchased and they would not replace.  I've had chargers for years before and they still haven't died and these guys wouldn't back their product for 4 months?  Look elsewhere when looking for an iPhone 5 charger. I wouldn't recommend the product.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Alright, I read Harry Potter and Twilight (both on a whim) and both series hooked me and before I knew it I was going to the midnight book openings at Barnes and Noble.  Anyway, after I finished Twilight I figured it was time to read books written for a more adult audience again.  I went to the movie, which was entertaining but poorly written, and I decided to see what all the fuss was about and read the book.  I completely understand, the book is intricate and a lot of attention was paid to character development.  The movie skipped over vital pieces of plot and character development.  Worse yet, it made up stuff that is not in the book in an attempt to make up for it.  That is too bad, but the book is wonderful and I am again hooked.
0345522478|5.0|This was a fun and lively book. The characters were fun and exciting and kept you interested to the end. I recommend it. I liked the way he mixes old school magic into modern day college life.
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|Quality is vastly improved. In some of tracks songs sound clearer and more defined.  As a Pink Floyd fan you get to hear them in a new light.
B008Y5N3O8|4.0|This film is a master class in acting. Great performances all around,  especially from Baldwin, Lemmon, and Spacey. They do a truly amazing job here.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I have bought Anker products before. They are reliable and perform very good. This one is a good solution when you just have one USB 3.0 port. So far, so good. I recommend the product
140006922X|5.0|It explains so much information it was difficult to find elsewhere in an organized manner.  It clarified many things that had been in doubt/
B00821OX98|5.0|Good movie !very nice  movie  more like this one on amazon please .. Thank you very much . Can' t wait for next seazon
B0053JJLLC|5.0|This is a 5 Star for me because it weaves together a relatively shallow set of characters into an interesting and imaginative situation with a near limitless moral set of extremes.  Michael Crichton includes the usual unexpected twists and turns that keep the story from being a predictable foray into banal science fiction genre.  He brings just enough of the 'bad guy gets his comeupance' to satisfy our sense of justice, but maintains the fresh and imaginative story telling that his readers look to when another Crichton novel hits the shelves.  As always, his ending had me wishing for the sequel, the movie, or even the television series.
B007THA4FI|1.0|This book, The Casual Vacancy is by the great author J.K. Rowling but, you knew that by now, didn't you? Now I want to first say that I can't really give this book a totally 100% fair review because I could not finish it. I really couldn't even get through half of it, I got through about 38% of the book before I had to just call it quits.<br /><br />That being out of the way now I will say that this book was horribly boring to me. Yes, I did initially look at this book because J.K. Rowling wrote it however, I knew it was going to be nothing like Harry Potter. I figured that because Rowling is a fantastic author it would be a good book. I was wrong, so very wrong. The first chapter was decent but it didn't really grasp my attention to the book.<br /><br />The best part of the book that I found was the part that involved Krystal Wheedon. Unfortunately, Krystal's part of the story was not able to keep my attention. I was discussing it with my sister who was also trying to reading the book and we came to the conclusion that if the book really would have captured our attention we would have been staying up late and attached to the book, just like other books we have been.<br /><br />There are a lot of characters in the book and they are well described, almost too well and too much. The town of Pagford seems like a sleepy town with a bustling political system in which most of the main characters would like a piece of the action since Barry Fairbrother died. Speaking of Barry Fairbrother, I would classify him as a main character although he dies in the first couple of pages. Weird, right?<br /><br />I won't discourage anyone to read the book, you might like it. Heck, you might really love the book but it just wasn't my cup of tea.<br /><br />I was not impressed by J.K. Rowling's first adult novel.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Simply one of the best documentaries I've ever seen regardless of subject matter. Well paced, informative and hugely entertaining. You do not have to be a fan of the group or of music in general to kick back and enjoy this.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|You guys, I was so so so excited when I got the opportunity to read Eleanor & Park by Rainbow Rowell. I even told you about the book before I got a copy to read it, remember? I may or may not have (I totally did) done a little dance when I got the notice to download this book.<br /><br />The fact that it is based in the 80's is fantastically awesome. I was born in the 80's and even though I was only 4 in 86 (calculating my age now, aren't you?) I still have fond feelings for the 80's. I haven't read too many books set in the 80's though so I was excited about that.<br /><br />The characters I loved! Eleanor who is the new girl with really red hair and doesn't dress or act like anyone else. In fact, because of this she is often the butt of jokes and is bullied a bit which is really sad. You just feel bad for her and her family being very very poor doesn't help. She has family troubles. I won't go into them but it's horrible and I feel for her. Not because I've been through it (I haven't) but because no one should be in that situation. She doesn't know it in the beginning but, Park becomes her savior. He is the light in her life and although she refers to him as the \\"stupid Asian\\" in the beginning a lot, she falls for him, hard.<br /><br />The relationship between them is adorable especially in the beginning when it's just small things like Park finding out she's reading the comics that he is so he holds the book open a little wider for her and stays on the pages longer. While I was reading this I couldn't help but have a smile on my face it is just really sweet. When their relationship builds it doesn't get any less sweet. Park says all the right things that someone wants to hear. Eleanor knows she's falling for Park but doesn't want to drop her walls because of what she is afraid of.<br /><br />In the end they go through so much. I cried at the end of the book, I did. It is really touching and heartbreaking at the same time. No one should be in the situation that Eleanor is in and Park stays by her side.<br /><br />This is a definite read and re-read book. I was excited for it and I am still excited for this book. Rainbow Rowell did a fantastic job writing the characters, making you feel their relationship, the excitement and fear that they went through.<br /><br />I even loved Park's mom and how she never quite spoke English properly because she was from Korea. I adored that bit. I loved the love from Park's mom and dad. It showed two different type of adult relationships and I appreciated that.<br /><br />I recommend this book from the tallest building and I will shout it! This is great read.eanor is in and Park stays by her side.<br /><br />This is a definite read and re-read book. I was excited for it and I am still excited for this book.

1476727651|5.0|I generally do not enjoy sequals as much as originals; however, even if one had never read The Shining, this would be a gread read! I loved to see Danny's journey after leaving The Overlook. Highly recommend!
0375703764|5.0|I'm a huge fan of this book, and actually purchased it as a gift for a friend. If you're into the odd/supernatural and unconventional books, this is a book for you.
B00540G3G6|5.0|I love this animated  movie, and the 3D was great.  I am glad I spent the money for the 3D BR version.
B008V8FVTI|5.0|Outstanding movie. Gut wrenching at times and intense throughout. Highly recommend. I had to pause it a couple times just to take a breather due to the intensity of some of the scenes.
1423141997|4.0|In the continuing story of The Heroes of Olympus, we get a perspective from out known hero Percy Jackson and two new friends that he meets when he is in a Roman camp.  His memories are slowly coming back to him and his friends are looked down upon; underdogs. We meet Hazel who has a love for horses and drawing. We meet Frank who has a military mom and feels as if there is nothing special about himself. All these characters learn new things about friendship and themselves.<br /><br />Although I enjoyed this book, I tend to believe that my attention wasn't as gripped while reading it.  The book before it was really amazing, and this one was so-so, but I didn't really connect with the characters as I did in the last one.  I am very much looking forward to reading the next book though!  Rick Riordan definitely has caused me to enjoy this series (and the Percy Jackson books before it).
B0035JRVBO|5.0|One of the best movie ever ! Tom Hanks was incredible. Nice acting from him. The story is nicely tell. Perfect
B0060MYM7O|2.0|This is a soap opera with a lot of sex and violence. Nothing ever gets resolved. Good guys are killed. Bad guys are killed. Everyone is always conniving.  It is good for a cheap thrill. I wished to sell my copy after watching it but Amazon has restricted sales; unless you happen to be a commercial seller. Will go into the waste basket unless they change their policy. Was tempted to order the third season but will end it here.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|One of our all-time family favorites! We enjoy listening to the soundtrack as well. I would highly recommend this version of the movie.
B00BRR66SA|4.0|This album is smooth! It's a nice ride from beginning to the end. Well put together; I'm glad I bought it.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|One of our favorite sports movies but I wouldn't recommend it for younger kids. Our older kids really enjoyed watching it. Very heart-warming!
B008RJFRTK|1.0|Stick with the lite version. I got Pro for the &quot;find&quot; function. I'm in Texas, it shows my location as Texas, but when I use that function it searches New York City and tells me there is nothing nearby.  I can tell it to search the screen, but then it tells me everything is 1,200 miles away. Not much help when you're trying to find a restaurant nearby!  And it tells me I need to download the New York City map. HELLO!!!  I'm in TEXAS!!!  I'm not going to New York just to get lunch today.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|I enjoy this movie every time I watch it.  I like the  Stargate movies but I also follow Kurt Russell's movies too.
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|If you are going to just hate on Shakespeare than not much of this would appeal to you I'd guess, but I still think you should watch it once anyway.<br />Whedon is a modern Genius known for his ability to turn a witty phrase and for writing strong, independent female characters (so think the opposite of Stephanie Meyer).<br />So what to do when the words are already written for you? You make it visually interesting. As Shakespeare words unfold from Whedonite experienced actors Like Nathan Fillion, Amy Acker, Clark Gregg etc Joss uses the visual element of movie making to amuse the audience and throw in little touches that make the experience unique.<br />While at all times the acting isn't Perfect Amy Acker's Pleading speech as Beatrice to Benedict, regarding avenging Hiro's honor was brilliant.<br />Shot in 12 days during post Production of Avengers at Joss Whedon's home as a pet project for him and shot all in black and White this makes a great change of pace addition to The Legion of Whedon obsessed fans collection.<br />I loved it and laughed out loud several times and full disclosure Much Ado is My favorite Shakespeare play.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For 35 bucks, this provides a lot of fun.  I don't think anyone who drops that piddly amount to get a Chromecast, will be at all disappointed.  However, you do have to have a decent, high-speed connection.  Duh.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's easy to see and easy to use. I really like seeing all the numbers in a long list so I don't lose my place. I never use the higher functions but they are there if I ever do need them.
B00FN811SY|5.0|See many translations at your fingertips. Pics and references are great. Easy to read and great for research. This is a must if you want to read the bible.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|This works perfectly for what I ordered it for. Plugging any mp3 player or ipad into an iphone dock is a cinch.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Some parts of the book went to far on the story....it is another cruel world...compiting with what we live each day
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Very entertaining - animation is great and the characters are interesting and humor is just right. A great take on an old tale.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is very fun and it is an easy play. The game keeps you  the whole time you are playing. No complaints.
0802473156|5.0|My husband and I took the profile test and then read the book. Fortunately, my husband and I have the same top two primary love languages. The book uniquely brings it all together when you understand the five love languages and adapt or modify the languages to your own relationship.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book to all people, whether your are in a relationship or not.  A GREAT BOOK!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I used my free Amazon coins to purchase this game.  I love this because it reminds be of Mahjongg Dark Dimensions.  It really tests you skills since it is a timed game.  I play this over and over and really enjoyed the game.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book was different from many of his others.  I felt as if he was adding words to have over 300 pages in the book.  I felt that the main character 's(Malcolm Bannister) descriptions of life in prison digressed and I got bored reading about it.  However, as always Mr. Grisham had quite a twist in the end, but he could have had  more description in the end as the reader was left hanging.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I bought a couple of these specifically for having a small pocket sharpener that will work ok on serrated blades.  I have a couple tanto style blades that are half-serrated and this tool allows me to sharpen both the flat blade and the serrated edge.  Takes a bit of practice on the serrated blade, but I've been able to keep a good sharp edge on my knifes and the tool doesn't take up much space.
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|It's Alter Bridge here we're talking about. Need I say more? All hail TREMONTI!! It's their best album yet. If you don't get it within 5 seconds of reading this review, you are less than human. Do it now. Google Play has it for the same price, by the way.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|This is a really fun game!  You should definitely buy it.  It keeps me coming back for me with the achievements and interesting strategies.
B0009A40ES|1.0|Pretty obvious this was written/produced for maximum shock value and smacks of anti-conservative soap boxing. IE. Rich white males are evil and viscious and killers at heart. If it had been written and directed by someone with a psych degree or gone the other way and been a documentary on white male agression, it would have been great, maybe even genius; but as an unfunny and undramatic gruesome for the sake of gruesome thrill kill flick, it fails like Shakespeare's Richard the third failed--it too, left audiences wondering whether they should laugh or be horrified. I left going, \\"That sucked.\\"
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thought that it a super fun and addictive game even better than the origanal in my oppinion AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />You should get it!
B007V2WAR6|5.0|As another reviewer stated I knew nothing about this movie except gorgeous Ewan McGregor!! Also I heard it was a sort of cult classic. Anyways I was blown away. The energy of the opening scene was Awesome. I have never tried any drugs and any narcotic the Doctor gives should be banned unless dying (it sucks) again sorry but watching how amazing they felt gave me an inside to why the addiction even playing Russian roulette in the 80s was so Amazing and \\"needed\\" the actors REALLY gave me a real almost tactile feel of the amazement of the drugs entering their bodied. I finally got it. The whole ride was great. The characters were so real. The collaboration with the amazing Director and uber talented cast gave a us a true to life account of that kind of life ,and not to judge.<br />there were some CRAZY scenes, I mean crazy. Most hilarious a rare few so so shockingly sad. Such is life. I have seen this movie back to back and I never have done this. Its one of my go to movies, from now on. I have so much to say about this gem. I dare not ruin it for the \\"virgins\\"<br />Enjoy let yourself go and experience the film. The only way to fully get it. Oh sometimes I couldn't understand a friggen word they were saying, the accent is so thick. Wow. which made it all the funnier.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Great game. Fun, fast and easy to play. It's a good way to past time Great for any one that likes bubble breaking games.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Typical action-packed Tom Cruise film but filled with unexpected twists & surprises.  I hate when a film is predictable.  This was VERY entertaining.  Loved it & highly recommend it.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|My little brother Major loves this game and my mom thinks it's a cool game and me and the Omg Girls Love it &lt;3
0071766588|5.0|Nice book for study Toefl.<br /><br />If you want prepare Toefl testm, buy it!<br /><br />It will be good for your score.
0545123275|3.0|I give this book more around 3 1/2 as opposed to just 3. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW)<br />This book was not stellar, or some magnificent piece of art. I'm not going to say this story was beautiful and oh-so poetic. Don't get me wrong, the descriptions were nice, but I'm not really one for flowery language. But as a whole, this was a very cute and cozy story to follow. I give it a three-star rating because it's not a very original story and it gets slow at some points, but it's also well-written and it's a sweet love story, and I did enjoy reading it.<br />I really love the woods-y and wintry atmosphere Stiefvater sets up, and this is the type of book that I want to snuggle up in bed to. I also like how the font is blue, and I love the cover art.<br /><br />The story follows Grace and Sam, and the story is told in first person, and the chapters alternate from Sam's point of view to Grace's. I actually like when stories do that, because it sets up a little bit on anticipation. Sam is a werewolf, and the wolf lore in this story takes an interesting new turn; instead of the full moon changing them, the cold weather does. Sam saved Grace when she was a child from his pack, and from then on he'd watch her from the woods during the wintertime. Grace has always felt close to the wolf even though she never knew it was actually a boy. Long story short, he gets injured as a wolf and turns back into a human and he and Grace meet and fall in love. However, their time together is limited as winter is approaching-she lives up in Minnesota so I guess it gets colder faster, which makes sense for obvious reasons-so they're on borrowed time, essentially, since Sam is only human due to his initial injury. Another main plot point is one of the town's residents supposedly being killed by the wolves and this all leads to Sam and Grace trying to find a cure.<br /><br />Like I said, it gets slow at some points and the story line isn't really anything new or original, but it was nicely executed and it was a cute love story. The fact they had limited time together after all those years of looking from afar made for an interesting new twist. Their love wasn't as shallow as some I've come across, which is nice. They spend a lot of time together and Sam is actually a cool guy. He's not a stalker, abusive, condescending, none of that. He was a little fragile at times, but he treated Grace really well. When he took her to the candy shop and they got cocoa, that was an absolutely adorable scene. Their relationship was a refreshing change of pace from a lot of the paranormal romances these days. Another popular trend in paranormal romances is the conveniently absent parents, but in Shiver, that factor actually bothers Grace. While a lot of characters like the fact that their parents are never around, Grace is very frustrated by that and she gets emotional at one point in the book, especially when she brings up how she almost died as a child and her parents still don't care about her that much. If you're just looking for a cute little love story where you don't have to think too much, this is a great book to read. The romance didn't make me roll my eyes or want to tear my hair out. The story just gets a little boring at points, is all.
B005LAIIGM|5.0|The irony of the film's title is that there isn't any, gravity that is, but that's not to say it lacks gravitas. It does in ways both unexpected and transcendent. It's been seven long years since Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's last film, 2006's emotionally propulsive thriller, [[ASIN:B000QGAU4E Children of Men]], which was a masterful work of suspense in the midst of one seriously dystopian vision of the apocalypse. Somehow, the less-than-prolific filmmaker manages to surpass that impressive work with this terrifying yet genuinely profound 2013 science-fiction thriller that buzzes by in a fleet 91 minutes. Although Ang Lee effectively used 3-D CGI effects to enhance the magical realism of [[ASIN:B00BGZ8OLA Life of Pi]], I have never seen a film use them as purposefully and powerfully as Cuar&oacute;n does here within the dramatic structure of the story. Co-written with his son Jon&aacute;s, the screenplay, by contrast, is life-size in its intimacy and even with all the technical jargon, at times poetic. This combination gives the film an almost mythic reach and at the same time, brings insight into the way the human spirit works against the overwhelming emptiness of space. The story takes place about 372 miles above Earth, and the alternately ethereal and scarifying setting is captured in brilliant detail by ace cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and special effects master Tim Webber.<br /><br />Pay particularly close attention to the uninterrupted seventeen-minute sequence that opens the film. It's a bravura piece of cinema by anyone's standards. In brief, bio-medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone is on her first space mission studiously installing a device to fix the Hubble Space Telescope on the U.S Space Shuttle Explorer. Mission commander Matt Kowalski is a veteran astronaut who devilishly spacewalks around her in a jet pack. Mission Control reports that the Russians have blown up one of their own satellites which transforms into a massive attack of hurling debris that arrives in a matter of seconds and will continue to make an orbital return causing massive destruction every ninety minutes. There is no time for the crew to return to the shuttle much less Earth, and the damage to the craft and nearby International Space Station is extensive. It's enough to say that Stone sets off on a journey not only of physical survival but spiritual awakening as her character has been in a listless state since a senseless personal tragedy occurred back home. If you don't count the voiceovers at the beginning, there are only two actors who make up the entire cast, and they are grade-A stars who bring their personal charisma to the fore.<br /><br />George Clooney has the smaller of the two roles as Kowalski, and he uses his natural insouciance to great effect as his wisecracking gives way to a character who provides the knowledgably becalming tone that Stone needs at the story's most critical points. He makes one particularly risky scene work by the sheer magnitude of his character's life-affirming bravado. He also impressively wrote the scene. Even so, this is Sandra Bullock's film from start to finish, and it amazes me how she wasn't even among the top casting choices for the role (Angelina Jolie turned it down twice). Although Stone may come across as emotionally stunted, Bullock offers her natural likeability as a necessary counterbalance. However, that observation short-changes her stellar work here, especially the pure physicality of her performance. Intriguingly, her character is not that far removed from the one she played nearly twenty years earlier in [[ASIN:6304765266 While You Were Sleeping]] in that both deal with personal losses with an emotional alertness that wins us over completely. Only this time she does it with a graceful maturity that deepens the catharsis of the incredible odyssey she experiences, this in spite of a few overtly sentimental moments thrown in for good measure. Regardless, this is Cuar&oacute;n's towering cinematic achievement, and the movie truly stands on its own.e truly stands on its own.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Very good game, is easy to play and have a lot of diferents screens, but have a little problem, you need to wait for more energy. I like it
B001MSMULG|4.0|Silva at his best. Fast moving read. Characters well fleshed out and identifiable. I enjoyed his descriptions of the settings.  Plot is complicated and intriguing.
B00F52YOPA|4.0|Best part is you can play it off line . Very nice and fun I enjoyed very much.but the best thing is its off line
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is really cute. It's kind of like Wario Ware for the Wii with all the little mini games.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I enjoyed the black and white version of this game, and this color version is great too.  The colors isn't just for show - it changes the gameplay enough that you learn to play a little differently. The color pictures are a great reward when you finish a puzzle.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this album! ! Every song is amazing! My only complaint is that there isnt more songs :(
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Another well written and good story from Jo Nesbo. This is the first Det. Harry Hole novel. It takes place in Australia which is a nice change of pace from Norway.
B004JMY312|3.0|Not the highest caliber acting. Entertaining none the less. Midler's character is funny throughout the movie. Family friendly Halloween fun.
B00CD4RPWM|2.0|meh, it was ok. i don't know what i was expecting - this is billed as \\"outlander from jamie's POV\\" but that's not really what i got out of it. it was more a cliff's notes version of outlander, with pictures. and i wasn't that impressed with the pictures. don't get me wrong, the artist is more talented than me, i couldn't have drawn them, but i had trouble telling people apart - jamie and murtaugh and kenneth and colum and dougal... they all looked the same except for their plaids, and even then there was some confusion. overall i would have to say don't waste your time with this, unless you're jonesing for some outlander while waiting (and waiting and waiting) for the next one to come out and even then, just go back and re-read outlander.
B00ESNDQWY|5.0|Another amazing season of The Good Wife. Great premiere with an excellent mix of acting and music. Sets up the season well.
B00FON9MLQ|5.0|I have never enjoyed any of the courtroom or police dramas but this show is interesting and actually exciting. Very intelligently written with characters of some depth. The writers do the continuous background story very well and with each episode a self-contained story with a beginning and usually climactic ending.<br /><br />This season's first two episodes looks like the show is actually getting better.<br /><br />In general what I like about the show is its' exploration of liberalism. I mean REAL liberalism and not the Orwellian double-speak of today in which authoritarianism, intolerance, and love of the State is referred to as being \\"liberal\\". Whether it is feminism, guns, or religion it is presented through the lens of American liberalism. Instead of \\"sides\\" winning out it seems it is the Individual that is considered the most relevant entity - a complex Human that doesn't just swallow tribal rhetoric then spits out singular agendas. Much self-interest prevents such a thing and the show is unapologetic about this.<br /><br />It is also fascinating to observe extreme objectivity, I mean \\"cut-throat\\" at times, and of course the Law is a perfect place to explore this.<br /><br />It's sort of like the show \\"House\\" except it is a team of lawyers instead of doctors.
B00CFA227C|5.0|Great movie, was just as I had expected.  Came in perfect condition and contained the DVD, Blue Ray, and digital copy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love this book. It's by far the best of all the books in the hunger games trilogy! Read read read!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great movie, was just as I had expected. Came in perfect condition.  This movie is a favorite of our families.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I like this game because it combines hand eye coordination and strategy. It is a timed game which requires you to find the correct combinations as quickly as possible.
B00FEHXISA|4.0|it is what you think it is going to be, an action movie, good guy, bad guys, etc.  If you are a fan of Iron Man then you were skeptical when they introduced mandarin because in the comic book he was kind of hokey but they did a great job of adding a few twists and keeping it entertaining.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a very fun game but forces you to go online and review it<br />That makes it kind of difficult
B0089EHWQE|4.0|It was a good read with thought provoking questions.  It was a four star read---I think you'd like it. OK
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|I have had little exposure to Bluegrass music so I won't comment on the bluegrass nature of the album, but all I know is that I loved it from start to finish!  Blue Ridge Mountain Song is pure perfection. Alan's voice makes me melt.
B002RSQGQK|5.0|I thought it was a great movie! It's well written, nicely photographed and directed. Everyone should watch this one. 5 out of 5 for me!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I have been playing this game for a day and I can't put it down. Very intriguing and never boring. Lots of things to find and quests to take on. Not you average game by far. Definitely a great game for everyone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wonderful book ! I couldn't put it down and everyone is talking about it! Well done writing this book for sure!
B005LAIIN0|5.0|If you are NOT a WALKING DEAD-type of fan, you will not enjoy this movie.  So, do not bother to submit a review.  I really dislike it when someone enters a review BECAUSE they do not like the genre of the movie.  THAT IS ABSURD.  I saw this movie and loved the role Brad Pitt played.  I thought it was an exceptional performance.  The ONLY thing I did not like was the co-star, his wife.  I do not think she is a very good actress and I do believe Brad Pitt held up the entire movie with his exceptional performance.  I did not read the book, nor will I as I never read one and then go see the book's movie, or vice versa.  I believe that by doing so, you are comparing all the time.  So, if I read a book and then go see the movie to compare its authenticity in story and/or intensity, I KNOW I will be disappointed, so why should I set myself up for that?  I absolutely loved this movie and will buy it here at Amazon shortly.  I think the Director did an exceptional job and the screenwriters nailed it.  GOOD JOB, BRAD, as I do not normally like him in anything he stars in and I sometimes wonder why he chooses the scripts he does.  Brad Pitt has changed my mind about his acting abilities because of this movie.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved this game.. please make another, the map, the journal, the evidence wall, the many places to explore, the story, and oddly... the bell, ringing in a harminous way(?). I hope it comes out very soon by Halloween! :D
B004B5W27Y|5.0|Agaetis Byrjun is an album like no other. It is one of the most beautiful, haunting, transcending albums I've ever heard.
B001NLL93W|4.0|Interesting reading. Nice character and plot development. Good, though predictable, resolution to this phase of the story. Worth a read.
B0058UXHHK|3.0|This is definitely one of the better free kindle books. Rose is a very likeable character, and her transformation into a more independent person and her need for new experiences is nicely developed - even though it happens a bit fast. A real person under similar circumstances would need a lot more time to spread her wings, I guess. Anyway, two things put me off a bit, and kept me from giving 4 stars: The unsatisfying ending to the mystery which was a disappointment after the suspense had been built up so well, and ******* spoiler alert ********* the way Rose reacts to the vision of her own death in 4 days. Apart from shedding a few tears, she just calmly accepts the fact and tries to complete her wish list before she dies. No panic, no terror, no trying to do anything to change her fate, even though in the past her visions have not always come true and thus it is likely that this one is preventable, also. For the most part however, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it.
1856697525|5.0|Saul Bass was clearly way ahead of his time. His work is timeless. This book does a wonderful job of not only giving you a close-up view to his work, but a great deal of insight into his thought process. The book is beautiful with hundreds of large full color pictures of his work. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in graphic design.
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|I'm so in love with this movie. The entire movie looks like something out of Vogue magazine. Although, the movie is different from the original. It is a good view.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|I do $BUY$ cd's, that pisses people off! Anything bought on itunes, (Which I have), or where ever, is COMPRESSED SOUND! That is why I buy the CD's to listen to my home stereo. I do add them to my itunes inventory, that is, after I PURCHASE the CD! Joe rocks! Beth is right there with him! BUY IT!  Thanks for reading, *(A clue-Watch SOUND CITY!)* That will tell it all!...:)....GREG
1400069742|5.0|In her trademark style of  lucid prose laced with just the right amount of good story-telling drama, Lynne Olson has produced another tour-force of contemporary history. As she has done so well in her previous books, she brings to life characters and events of the period that make them seem alive today. She paints honest pictures of both FDR and Lindbergh  that ring true. Neither vitriolic attack nor hagiography, the book illuminates its characters in an honest light that makes the reader eager to turn the page yet not ever wanting the book to end.
B000HC2PCM|5.0|Great CD. I have always loved to hear Merle's singing. It makes a great addition to my country collection. Wish my kids and grandkids agreed with me.
B009LDD590|5.0|Excellent production, wonderful overall, but the digital copy is never available. Hope they do something about that, because i would love to have it in my iPad.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|It was good however you could see what was going to happen for a long time I would have liked it to be more suspenseful
B002NN5F7A|1.0|Boring, hard to understand, not a topic I expected and the foul language was totally disturbing. I turned it off after 15 minutes.
B000784WMW|5.0|I love this version of Jane Eyre above all others that I have seen. The only version I have not seen is the Orson Wells version and I can just imagine his portrayal of Rochester! Anyway, I had not really seen Timothy Dalton in too much, but he portrayed in my opinion, the best Rochester of all the versions.  He was the right amount of  crazy, haughty, tender, remorseful, witty and all the other qualities that the author gave him in the book.  He had the look and the poise. I do agree with others that he was a little too handsome but, this can be overlooked and only makes you like him so much better!!  I love Zelah as Jane as well.  She is passionate and intelligent.  I don't agree with others who said she was too old. I watch this version over and over again on Netflix.  I must buy my own copy so that I can enjoy it for years to come. I don't take anything away from another version.  This one for me, is the best.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Spoilers ahead.<br /><br />This movie was ok, despite its faults until the ridiculous machine gun scene.  The logistics of the scene make no sense whatsoever.  You have gigantic machine guns that cut through steel that are shot accross an entire floor, yet the floor does no collapse and you really have no idea how anyone got away because, even suspending belief, no one would have gotten away.  Yet they do.  And then, for some reason, they go back in without waiting for backup, or explaining the severity of the situation to their headquarters. And the villain sees Dredd and he sees her, and she doesn't shoot him with her gigantic machine guns that are still loaded right in front of her...and..well, you get the point<br /><br />And then, the 'big reveal' is that the drug dealer that is trying to kill them is, in fact, a drug dealer trying to kill them.<br /><br />And put on top of that a useless psychic woman cliche who never seems to know what the guy next to her (or the drug dealer) is thinking or going to do, which results in her obligatory capture.<br /><br />And a silly looking firework bullet that clearly wouldn't have hurt anyone that turns the tide for Dredd.<br /><br />The CGI is excessive and bad, just as the excessive violence in the movie that serves no real purpose.  CGI Squibs are lame and obvious.<br /><br />And, of course, making a Dave Chapelle lookalike as the 2nd in command constantly made my brain scream 'what?!'.<br /><br />Then, Dredd becomes psychic after being shot and the baddy lets him make an exceptionally dumb speech.<br /><br />And the other medics and judges all just casually and dumbly wait outside all night and when the doors open they casually stroll in, no big deal.  Just a joke<br /><br />A real joke.<br /><br />Wanted to like this, but it isn't even as good as the Stallone vehicle.  At least that one was intentionally funny, the city looked good, and it didn't rely on cgi.

B00B19GKI0|1.0|The start was to slow and very confusing, never finished watching. I am not sure what was going on it kept skipping around from one scene to the next.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my ten year old grandsons birthday.  He was so excited when received.  I have played this game with him and other family members and we thoroughly enjoyed!!
B008602KQI|5.0|This moving was quite entertaining and the cinematography was excellent.  Enjoyed every moment of it. Looking forward to the next one.
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|I'm not totally sure what the critics who loved this movie saw in this movie.  I thought it had some special moments, but much of it was boring and predictable.  I think George Clooney has done much better movies in his career although this was not a complete stinker.  If you can get the movie for less than $4 then go for it.  Otherwise save your money for something better.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|Good movie, A big fan of Brandon Frasier. Very entertaining and lots of laughs It's a close second to the original
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|It was a good movie, not the ending I expected but good movie.  It was worth renting and would recommend for watching
0439023521|5.0|I read this because my students were reading it. And, I got hooked. I read the next two books, but didn't enjoy number 3 as it just lost its power.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. The graphics are great quality. So many games are include. It can become quite addictive.
0060245867|5.0|With beginning readers this book is always a hit. I like to ask kids to try to write their own reversable stories after they've had a chance to play with this one.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|The design is good, 4/5 or so could be better but the layout is clear enough. 5/5 as it downloads videos well and has a good variety of options.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|We loved it so much we watched it 4 times....<br />Is fun, entertainment and heart warming too.<br />I will recomended for the whole family!
B005KELQEU|5.0|A good case. Well designed and put together. Not much more I can say than it does what I expected and does it well.

B003G4W49C|4.0|My husband wanted me to read this because the movie is coming out and he loves the books so in case the movie wasn't very good I would know the book first. I liked it, the book follows Ender through the ups and many downs of his life with side stores of the person he hates the most and the person he loves the most and how they effect his life. I would recommend this book to others.
B000JML7EC|5.0|Action on every page, hearty dialog, good guys/bad guys, conniving characters and double-crossing-well worth the read/re-read as the original fictional pirate tale.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|As usual amazing work by Ms. Adiche. Very well written. A must read for all the book lovers and my new favorite.. Americanah!!.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|I had this app on my iPhone and loved it. Sure glad I found it for android phone I have now.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is so amazin it is so fun and I just love to play it the kids have fun with it. I love the weekly challenges and the graphics are aw-some
B00FN8HS5O|4.0|Haunting. Ethereal. At times, incredibly unnerving.<br /><br />With the exception to the last few tracks, this may be one of those scores that is better listened to alongside the film than as a standalone album, but that's not to say it isn't great.<br /><br />Newcomer Steven Price does a tremendous job subtly weaving the themes that will come to a grand finale by the album's last few tracks early on. During the most intense sequences, Price utilizes an electronic, throbbing crescendo that steadily builds and builds until it's almost hard to listen to, and then sends the whole thing off a cliff and cuts all the sound out completely. The result is pure, unfiltered tension which is most always tempered with something soft and introspective so the listener does not end up grating their finger nails throughout the whole album. If I had one complaint, it would be that while these uncomfortable crescendos work splendidly within the context of the film, hearing them back to back, several times throughout the album, the effect starts to feel a little overused.<br /><br />Still, excellent excellent excellent.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|What was the purpose of this movie?<br /><br />It really tried to hard to be something philosophical and world changing but it was merely confused and disjointed.<br /><br />It took 3 hours to do what?
B001BANK32|5.0|Mr Kings works are always worth taking the time to read and this piece is no exception. If you want to experience a great read definitely pick this one up.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|The original series on blue ray, features both the original and enhanced versions of each episode. Enhanced versions have some improved effects and look nicer, but if you're one of those people who hates digitally enhanced classics, the original episodes are on there as well.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|The movie was a big disappointment. It was dull and boring with few suspenseful moments. The action and dialogue were predictable.  I would not recommend this to anyone. Not even Brad Pitt could save it!
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Well, I write about my experience in the way that I absorbe what I read, I mean, I always create a world and I picture myself in it. So, with the second book I felt inside of this world again and it was a very good experience. I think the story is well written and I loved all the characters and situations they had been through. Of course I bought City of Glass and I will continue diving myself in the story.
B00BX8PG4S|5.0|Great movie. Action packed , extremely suspenceful, It is basically a true story. Actors were brilliant , You woun,t won't get<br />up to get a cup of coffee. It,s a classic. I saw this movie many years ago, I remembered it , so I bought the DVD. It's in my top 10 movies of all time.
B001NLL93W|4.0|Of course I was expecting Clary and Jace weren't siblings, however, the discovery of that in the story is very good told, very convincing. I like the story of these particular series and I'll go for City of Fallen Angels!
B005LAJ16I|4.0|This was a very good movie. Acting was great. I look forward to getting the second season. Is he a spy or is he not a spy. The guessing game is on. Your glued to the tv in this one.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Loved this book. I had to read it after watching the TV series, and was pleasantly surprised to see that the novel differed from the series. I really enjoyed both the book and the series. :)
B008M87GJK|4.0|It is easy to forget that the World Series isn't; and that the Republican anti-democratic drift is only in America.  Events in Greece and Spain and Indonesia affect the whole globe.  Read it, you'll learn something new every day.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book had me at the first chapter. Classic Hosseini depicting war-time Afghanistan, but yet so different from both The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns. I really enjoyed the storyline, and can't wait to read it a second time around. :)
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Very inventive and entertaining....really a great addition to your game inventory.  In addition to the play mechanic, which is a constant challenge, it has the Big Red Button.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|lots of good songs.  it nice to play at work.  many songs are popular songs that you have heard on the radio.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun! Introduced my mom to it, and she will be using this as entertainment post surgery!
0312383320|5.0|Great book, and got it in the shape the description said. I have come to expect nothing less from the author than a great book and crazy plot with the characters.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|The latest season of supernatural does not disappoint. Here they find the balance of road adventures and mythic monsters the last two seasons lacked. Jared and Jensen are in top form. Get ready to laugh and maybe even cry with your favorite brothers.
B00C061I1M|3.0|Some of the songs were hard to listen to.  I was quite disappointed in the CD after listening to her on NPR, and expecting better.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I had a bit of trepidation before starting this journey with adult Dan Torrance since The Shining is one of my all-time favorite stories but Stephen King did Dan proud. Great continuation. If you loved The Shining, you will enjoy Doctor Sleep.
B00DVPN30A|5.0|Yes i have all of amo's past cds.I am what you'd call a 'fan.' This latest cd shows even more depth and growth.My favs. happen to be \\"High Water' and 'Chill in the Air.' But the whole cd is really something special.Great song writing coupled with Amos's truly original,usually gorgeous voice, and you can't go wrong.I really like the funky,bluegrassy feel on some of the songs.He's so good when he gets down n dirty. Meow! So basically,get this cd. His beautiful music might just change your life. For the better of course.and There's no one else out there like him. period.
B003U0I9U0|5.0|I was an A-Ha fan back in the eighties when Take On Me hit MTV.  I loved that voice on every song and every album A-Ha did after.  I hate it that they disappeared to Europe and we really did not get to enjoy those 25 years in the US like they did overseas.  I can listen to this over and over...what talented musicians.  They are definitely not a one hit wonder but an incredible band.  I don't know anyone today who can hold a candle to Morten Harket's vocal range. He can do it all. While there are a few of my faves missing I was thrilled at all that was included on this.  It truely is the very best of A-Ha.  If you are a fan or even just checking them out for the first time I promise this is pure listening pleasure.  I Hate the band disbanded in 2010 but fortunately Morten has put out a solo album since that lets us enjoy his mesmerizing vocals once again.  I want more!!
B005ZB91KY|3.0|The film is well made. The special effects and cinematography are high quality nothing that would take you out of the fantasy.  For this genre I would recommend this film if you are in the mood for super hero action figure entertainment and you have seen all the others this one will not disappoint.
B007G5O3K0|5.0|I was an A-Ha fan back in the eighties and just recently found them again when I saw Morten Harket on the Billboard Music Awards performing with Pitbull and Christina Aguilera.  Not only had he not aged a bit in almost 30 years but it made me revisit my love of A-Ha.  He has the most amazing voice with a vocal range that cannot be matched.  While A-ha disbanded in 2010 I was thrilled to find that were solo projects out there.You are in pure heaven listening to this cd.  I don't know how America let him slip thru their fingers all these years.  This talent while appreciated abroad should have had more! I would recommend this to anyone who loves a true vocal gift from the heavens as this is surely where Morten Harket came from. Pure genius!
B00ECTZKJ6|4.0|I was a Korn kid growing up. I lived and breathed their first three CD's, and tolerated the next three.  After guitarist, Head, left the band, I felt the music went lack-luster and was even childhood at times. I would hear a track from the radio here and there and quickly discover the radio track was the only really good thing on most of their CD's.<br />I have kept a mild interest in Head's new band, Love and Death, as well as enjoying his guest work with bands like Project 86.  After hearing he rejoined the band and was making music with them, my interest peaked.  Then I heard what I would consider the Paradigm Shift's weakest track, Never, Never, on the radio.  Ouch, is that what they became?  Weak, barely radio friendly?  I thought Head would infuse some heaviness back to the band.<br />This morning I came into work and started Spotify and there it was, Korn, The Paradigm Shift was promoted and could be streamed. I gave it THREE listens in a row.  I must say, MUCH better than anything they have done in almost 10 years.  Forget that, almost 15 years.  Sure, some tracks are weak (Lullaby for a Sadist and Never, Never)  and some are average. But for the most part, there are some surprises and twists that make this a pretty strong effort.  The electronics are mixed in at just the right amounts, and the guitars are as heavy as ever.  Put that with the strong percussion from Ray and bass by Fieldy and you have a pretty solid record.<br /><br />If I could tell the future, I would say this might be the precursor to a stronger record by the boys next time out. This one let them try new things while reacquainting themselves with their former guitarist. Let them get some tour dates and more writing time together and they could write one of the best albums we have heard since 1994.<br /><br />My overall impression is, give this a listen. If you like Korn (and Love and Death), you will probably enjoy this one.  Its not five stars, but its better than three.<br /><br />**Another thing of note, yes, the lyrics are explicit in, but they are not nearly as childish and in-your-face explicit as other Korn albums. At times they are harder to discern.  As a dad of young kids whom I would like to keep innocent, I appreciate this.**her thing of note, yes, the lyrics are explicit in, but they are not nearly as childish and in-your-face explicit as other Korn albums.

B00CDSVZHY|4.0|If you love Quinton Tarantion and westerns, you will love this one. As usual, lots of blood and action. Enjoy.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My boyfriends little boy is turning seven in a week and this is all he has been asking for! I'm so excited for his reaction!! It got here so fast! I'll write another review once he sees it!!
B008476HBM|5.0|I read this book over and over. I buy dollar copies at used bookstores to thrust upon friends who admit to having never read it. I love this book.
B002QS1O36|5.0|One of my favorite films. It never gets old and I could watch it every day if I had the time!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great for kids and adults. My 3 year old loved it. Would rent or buy again. Can't wait to see the second one
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|Fun, exciting, great puzzles! Had me jumping back in my seat on some of the gameplay. Loved it, I highly recommend playing this hard to put down game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I play this with my granddaughter and we have so much fun. She loves horses and thinks its awesome that she can pick her own horse
B00594XOZU|1.0|I can not log in to my kik account! It keeps saying its taking to long try again later ughhhh! So frustrating... if i could just log in i would be happy!
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|I definitely recommend reading this book.  It has everything, danger, suspense, love, death, and a fascinating view of India.<br /><br />The only thing I would say is that it was slow in a few places.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|All the songs on this album seem excellent, one of the best albums of music, from my point of view.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Interesting plot and characters.  A little less suspenseful and developed than prior books.  This is, however, hypothetical genius.  Recommend for the beach.
B00007E8V4|4.0|Not the best album of the band, but it's still a pleasure to hear; has good songs and sides - b of some other already known.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|Great movie, a lot of emotional moments. Would recommend it highly. Based on a true story. Great acting. Item arrived before expected, then again, Amazon always delivers on time.
B000007T1M|5.0|The band's first album, my favorite songs are Sugar and Spiders. I highly recommend it to hear the beginning of one of my favorite bands.
1423136802|5.0|I went through them too fast, when I was done I was left wanting more.  Excellent books for young people to read.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|A great album, loud sounds and great songs like Juicebox, Herth in a Cage, You Only Live Once, On The Other Side and more.
B008MZPVP4|5.0|This album brings all of the things I love about Down to the table.  If you like NOLA you will love The Purple EP.
B00000J7JO|5.0|The disc that I liked, all songs seem good. Highly recommended, will not be disappointed to hear it in its entirety.
0316776963|5.0|I love, love, love this book!!! I made the mistake of reading this book in public. I would laugh out loud in public and end up embarrassing myself. This is by far my favorite book by Sedaris.
B002KEDQJQ|5.0|Displays a very realistic superheroes, I liked the whole movie and I recommend it to everyone. It should be part of the coleccci&oacute;n.
B00F4PM6WG|5.0|I figured I would try it since the price was right (free!).  It didn't seem to be too much so I let my Grandkids try it out.  They were hypnotized!  It held their interest for quite awhile.  They are 4 1/2 and 2 1/2.  Very nice app!
B000021YQV|5.0|Toxicity was the first song I heard from the band, from there I became a fan of them, and have never been disappointed. Highly recommended.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have been using YAHOO email for about 15 years.<br /><br />It is safe, reliable and easy to use. I will continue to use it.
B00005NEUF|5.0|One of the best albums of the band.<br />Hard To Explain, New York City Cops, Take It Or Leave It, Soma are my favorite songs
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love this CD even more than I expected to. Adele is an outstanding talent and I look forward to more from her.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|All the songs on this album seem excellent, one of the best albums of music, from my point of view.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|I own every album these guys have put out.  I have NO EARTHLY IDEA how more people in the U.S. don't know about this group!!  Blackbird has been my favorite album of theirs, but this one may overtake it.  There really is NOT a weak point on this album.  Some of these songs gave me chills listening the very first go through.  I have no idea which is my favorite.  This is a MUST OWN for any rock listener.  These guys need more exposure.  Not only that, but I just went to Orlando and saw them in person.  They are even better live, which is unheard of nowadays with all this auto-tune crap circulating everywhere.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|This  was a  nice evening's entertainment. The story was interestingly played. I found a few similarities with another big name underwater game, but it was just difference to keep my interest. I love  Cathullu based horror games.  Would like to see more H.P.Lovecraft based stories.  Please.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|loved this movie! thanks for having it available for streaming online! also, very glad they changed the ending from the original.
B008VO3PA4|4.0|Enjoyed leafing through this.  Fun little book. Gave it as a gift as well. My cat enjoyed it too and promptly displayed his pleasure by peeing on my bathmat.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is such a great story, how ppl can hold on too hate without finding out the truth.  How ppl can deceive someone that truly loves them  and my mother always told me to keep my girlfriends away from your own home, I've have always taken that advise.  Enjoy this story, I did
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is a fantastic space western.  The characters are very rich and vibrant;  each with their own personality and agenda, but a weird sort of family all the same.<br /><br />I was disappointed to learn there is only 1 season, but that season is well worth watching.  I would recommend watching the &#34;Out of Gas&#34; episode first as it tells how most of the crew came on board and it would have been nice to have that before watching the other episodes.<br /><br />Great cast & great writing.  I highly recommend this to fans of the sci-fi & western genres.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|We saw them preform at the Britt Festival and they were amazing.<br />Can't get enough of this album. Great for just relaxing, working out or those long car rides.
1400067820|4.0|Taleb is always thought-provoking and engaging. I often wish he would be a little more focused and analytical, and less rambling.  However, Antifragile makes a good point.  We can all use the wisdom to know the appropriate applications of order and disorder.  Taleb forces the reader to think about that difference.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It's nice do what it says it can do and fast !!! Still learning what all this app can<br />Do very proud so far...
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|For the longest time, I avoided watching this movie. I was so prejudiced by the horrible Stallone rendition of the character that it didn't strike me as a movie worth watching. But after running out of choices and needing my movie fix one evening, I eventually broke down and watched it. Suffice it to say, it was a surprisingly great movie. A-list acting, terrific effects, and a plot with enough twists to keep you wanting. Karl Urban showed his versatility as an actor and who knew Lena Heady could be such a psycho bitch (ok former boyfriends notwithstanding). I was left wishing for more and eagerly hoping there was or would be a sequel in the works with the same primary cast. Definitely 5 stars.
B004SVM7BW|3.0|I am not computor savy I needed something for a beginner.  Since I am very impatient I need something more.dummy friendly and this just wasn't it.
B009SH5JS4|3.0|i love this movie but was extremely disappointed when i received it in the mail with it addressed to current resident or me. so if it had been accidentally delivered to the wrong house id have been out the money and the movie. not okay with that at all.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|I really like this game,it is fun ,not too hard but yet makes you have to use your brain. It has different difficulty levels and I have been playing for hours and still haven't beat it yet on casual so I know it will entertain me even longer when I try it on higher difficulties. I really appreciate the fact that someone finally made a game that takes me longer than a couple hours to beat. The scenes are beautiful too and it has played great on my kindle fire hd 8.9.  I had to be connected to the internet the first time I played but most people probably get started right after download so that shouldn't be a problem, I am not yet sure if I can play offline but I think I should be able to since I had a different game that this happened to me with and the second time I played I didn't need to be connected. If you go through games too fast and like me are looking for something that takes some brain power and more than a couple hours of play time I highly recommend this game. Also if you don't like ho games it lets u chose to play a different mini game each time one comes up, it also will let u skip if you don't have the patience to finish but I never skip any thing I paid to play.  And the price is awesome so what are you waiting for?
B008220BLG|5.0|Love love love love love this movie!!  I've probably watched it 10 times. The premise seems odd at first (a zombie in love..?!) but as the story unfolds, it totally works.  There is nothing not to love! You will absolutely fall for &#34;R&#34; in just the first few minutes. If you don't, well maybe you're dead, too.  The characters are adorable. The acting is first rate. The soundtrack (both the original score and the many well-known songs) is AWESOME and expertly used to enhance the scenes. The film style is fresh and entertaining. Funny, romantic, earnest...and for a zombie movie, not TOO gory. Not a film for kids, definitely, but not scary for timid adults, either.  After you watch the movie, get the book! It's different in some ways than the film, but you'll see many familiar lines, and as usual the book has much more detail to it than the film can include. I read the book twice, too. Gah... :)
B0091REZMW|3.0|Only on level 2 but seems quite fun up to now. Think that you should be able to play the game a little bit longer before being pushed to write a review.
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|AI Factory Limited's 'Backgammon' has a very good user interface. It shows you which pieces can be moved and where they can be moved to.  Someone learning how to play backgammon would find it helpful.  It follows all of the rules but it's CPU player is not a very good opponent.  It would be nice if it could be modified to recognize an end-game situation where one side has a guaranteed win.  It could then allow the option of &#34;starting the next game&#34; instead of playing out the game.  Even a beginner realizes that if you have 4 men on the one point and I have 13 men on the board, there is no way I can beat you.  Also it often loses a backgammon that could have been easily avoided, simply by playing a slightly smarter game.  In spite of these short-comings I play against it a lot.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am determined to read it from front to back.  I am very disappointed at not getting the one I bought for my paper white forwarded to the fire HD.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app. Easy to use and massive amounts of study and reading plans. Very good at motivating you to read the Word.
B00BGI086Q|5.0|Arrow is the best. this allows me to view the entire first season, and lets my wife catch up with the show.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is my favorite game so far. I love the card game and this just puts another level on it.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I always read reviews,  and usually they influence my decision.  This case had its share of negative reviews,  but I liked the look of it,  so I bought it.  And I don't regret it.  It fits my Kindle VERY snugly,  and when the cover is closed,  its very well protected.  It doesnt add much weight or bulk to the Kindle.  I actually dropped my Kindle face down on the driveway,  and nothing happened,  because it was protected. This is actually my second one ive purchased. My only complaint is that is that the first one had a felt lining on the inside cover which peeled off after much use.  The second one doesnt,  nice design change.  I really like this case!
B00DB3IDV6|5.0|Great writing, great acting. Love Kevin Spacey. Many thanks to Netflix for putting out this show and making it available. However, I would watch it for Netflix. At $8/month that is more cost effective than $1.99 per episode, plus you have lots of other shows you can stream too.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|Good game! I enjoy Tetris, and this kind of game has great replay value. Give me a word play game, or a puzzle game, any day (over the host of shooters, repetitive runners and games designed to sell product -- i.e. cartoon character/toy line games).
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Good Zombie movie.  Lots of action.  A different take on the zombie genre movies.  Great special effects.  Fast paced and exciting.
B005GSZZ1A|2.0|The book is padded for length and repetitive in content. Crude drawings do not enhance the tragic story. The author seems not to have interviewed respondents in Korean thus interpreting materials which could have various meanings.There is a need to bring the narrative uptodate and to follow through on both events pertaining to the Korean's author narrative and his place in his new society.
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|Great family movie that actually held some great family value characteristics.  A hit in our book.  It is well worth the watch and recommended for all age groups.
0812550706|3.0|My husband calls me a nerd, Im big into Dr Who, grew up on Star Trek and various sci-fi movies, so I thought I would love this book and wanted to read in in anticipation of the movie.  I have to say I wasn't that impressed.  LOTS of scene with young naked boys wrestling.  No sex, but lots of passages where the author goes out of his way to make sure you know they are nude and fighting or wrestling or whatever.  Not my cup of tea.  Weird and didnt add to the plot.  Ending was stupid, I kind of just wanted it to end anyway, and it wasn't even worth it.  I wont spoil it, but I think it just could have been better. I wont waste my time on any of the sequels.  Want a good sci-fi young adult series, go with the Tripod Trilogy in my opinion
B002DOSBMK|5.0|This whole series is just superb! A must read for any fantasy reader with any ounce of taste to go on
B0018O4YSQ|1.0|This blu-ray edition of Dark City is listed by Amazon as being region-free.<br />It isn't.<br />It won't play on my Sony Region B player here in Australia.<br />This is particularly frustrating since Dark City is an excellent Australian film.
6305428042|5.0|This is the greatest movie. I received it promptly and in one piece. I recommend it to everyone. Amazing, amazing, amazing
B0076DELIG|4.0|I've been reading the Harry Bosch novels for quite sometime.  This one is as good as the others and helps keep the character &#34;alive&#34;.
B00DDZM0GQ|3.0|If you like (or liked) tetris, you will probably enjoy playing this game. It has a way of taking my mind off of everything else.
B00EDOS6IC|4.0|Alter Bridge return with their highly anticipated new album Fortress which is definitely one of the best hard rock albums of the year. Produced by Michael \\"Elvis\\" Baskette (Blackbird and ABIII) and mastered by Ted Jensen, Fortress is an album full of hard hitting riffs, soaring choruses, and some killer guitar solos. Myles Kennedy is again the star of the show with those big vocals and he's strongly supported by the quality guitar playing of Mark Tremonti and the massive rhythm section of Brian Marshall and Scott Phillips on bass and drums respectively. Highlights include the heavy opening track \\"Cry Of Achilles\\", the metal grooving riffs of \\"Bleed It Dry\\" that shifts into a sweet guitar solo, the amazing vocal melodies and the whispered opening lyrics of the big ballad \\"Lover\\", the epic opening sound of \\"Calm The Fire\\" which turns into a huge driving riff, and the stunning chorus and uplifting sentiment of \\"All Ends Well\\". Alter Bridge are probably the best twin guitar band in rock at the moment and Fortress is another awesome album that is highly recommended to fans of quality hard rock. I've been blown away by these guys live before and now I'm really looking forward to seeing them again at Soundwave festival - 4.49 stars.
B00DNLXDUW|4.0|I am a lover of gmail and have been looking for a app that does what this claimed to do. cant believe I paid for it..its so not worth it.  couldn't even get it set up.. hopped an update is coming soon.<br />unhappy person!<br /><br />Well this app must have gotten an update or something. I had uninstalled it and then decided to give it another go .  It now works well like I had expected it to work the first time.  Guess uninstalling and reinstalling the app did trick!!!I am so happy now!!!
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|Bad for kindle fire because you can't blow in to it ,and it's not a multi touch device.Don't get it on the kindle fire!!!!!!!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Clearly written with love with the power to make the world better for us all.  ...and the experiments work!! Thank you.
B001KT6JPA|5.0|One of my fav's!!! Julianne Moore does an outstanding job! It's like a drama, psych, thriller all in one. 📺📺📺
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I found the case very useful except when I want to stand it up to read.  I can't tell you haw many times I've cracked myself in the face when trying to read laying down.  Maybe it would work better with one of those book pillows.
B001XUYA0W|4.0|Really good movie. Very life like. Lots of characters but you keep up cause they're good about going back and relating each one of them from the past and now.
0792843584|2.0|I just watched the 3hr and 39 minutes version of Heaven's Gate.  I believe Mr. Cimino was honestly intending this to be a story that haunted you for years to come.  Most movies based on true events, specially those with less than happy endings, tend to plague many viewers for some time.  Frankly the entire Harvard class of 1870 opening just did not segue very well into the movies classic theme. Why would a rich man with a Harvard degree and obvious family establishments end up in Wyoming?  All seems a little disjointed in places.  So we go from Blue Danube waltzing to scenes from Fiddler on the Roof.  (Amazing how stunt men put their life in danger and sometimes get killed or even maimed with little or no press but have a horse or another animal get a scratch and the director almost gets hanged.) The fusing of ancient Roman battle \\"tanks\\" actually did meld Kristofferson's classic education in the final battle scene and the subtle comment by the Calvary officer added additional credence to the technique.  Seemed ground breaking in the full frontal nudity scenes and given the occupation Isabelle Huppert it worked. Kristofferson still seems flat in his performances even 30+ years ago.  If that is his or the Director's intent then Bravo, otherwise he just does not project a lot of character in his roles.  I tended to be expecting something profound to happen throughout the movie but other than the obvious rich vs poor struggle in the battle it never really happened.  In the version I saw the Epilogue of Kristofferson back on a sailboat off Newport Rhode Island in 1903 with the woman he danced with at his Harvard graduation ball some 33 years later just didn't flow. I read th it to is was an attempt to depict his disconnection from life's choices. OK but I still would have preferred to have those elements transition better.
B000002HRE|1.0|There is one good song on this album...Only one -- Fuel. It is pretty badass. But they stopped there. The rest of the album is embarrassing to Metallica, metal, and metal lovers.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|Very exciting book, leaves you on the edge trying to figure out what will happen to innocent Rosé.  Can't wait to read the next book!
B00192KCQ0|3.0|Definitely their best album since 1991. Musically they're finally starting to change for the better, but after this many years I think any real comeback to 1980s Metallica is just a dream. The mastering is TERRIBLE. Vocals sound like shit. Drums are muddy. Guitars are muddy. Just go back to the stripped-down, basics of the 80s and you'll be OK. I also wish they'd drop the post-grunge, wannabe metalcore overdrive/distortion and get back to the simple, 80s, high-treble thrash drive. Basically, just do what you did in the 80s lol.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This really is a great book!  The references back to The Shining would make it easy enough for a person who hasn't read The Shining to understand, however who hasn't read The Shining!  This is a must read Stephen King book.
B00EBDXT9G|5.0|The last great album Metallica ever produced. Their 3rd or 4th best album, and a really good one. You can see a slight evolution coming, which was to be their self-titled album 3 years later, but still sticking to their trash roots for this one.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book has all of the excitement of all of this author's books. I love the fact that he is so good at keeping the reader involved  and there are twists and turns you don't see coming.
B00EBDXU4A|4.0|This album gave Metallica the huge commercial success they apparently wanted, and was also the beginning of the end for them. Since then they've struggled to put together even decent albums, and had huge flops like St. Anger and Reload. While nowhere near as bad ass as their first 4 albums, this is still the last must-own Metallica album. It has some really cool songs, and still some semblance of their trash days -- Through the Never, Wherever I May Roam, Nothing Else Matters.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I confess that the negative critics kept me from experiencing OBLIVION on the big screen and the mentioning of an \\"alien invasion\\" didn't exactly stimulate my appetite for Joseph Kosinski's hors d'oeuvre (IMHO, there is only one thing that alien beings might find interesting about our planet, and surprisingly the film got that right dead-on). But fortunately one of my friends insisted that I \\"wanted\\" to see the film and he was right.<br /><br />Many critics claimed that OBLIVION was supposedly derivative and built on sci-fi tropes. I couldn't agree less. Joe Kosinski was never cagey about OBLIVION being an homage to the science fiction films of the 1960's and 1970's (PLANET OF THE APES and THE OMEGA MAN come to mind) and used elements and ideas from these works. But here he created something completely different, original and fresh out of these (and never at the expense of the original work like the shameless \\"copy and paste\\" of BEN HUR's chariot race in a highly anticipated movie from 1999), resulting in a film much larger than the mere sum of its parts.<br /><br />On the contrary, Kosinski uses these elements and ideas as subtle hints that appearances are deceiving to tell a science fiction story in the best tradition of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, renowned for its unsuspecting story turns and twists. By the end of the film it should be abundantly obvious that the drones were neither inspired by Pacman or WALL-E but rather by a remote-controlled device in one of these films from the last century.<br /><br />Admittedly, watching the film for the first time reveals what appears to be a couple of plot holes but basically these are necessary evils not to give the surprising twist away. Watching the film for the second time and from the inevitable new perspective things start to make a lot of sense and Olga Kurylenko's acting, now that audiences can fully understand what her Julia character must have gone through upon her awakening, is quite impeccable and reveals how skillfulJoe Kosinski uses body language (something I had already admired in his previous film TRON: LEGACY) to tell what's going on inside his characters.<br /><br />OBLIVION is presented in stunning vistas and in a cinematographic style that takes the time to tell the story without the hectic pace that often plagues contemporary movies. The Blu-ray looks fantastic, the level of detail and textures is remarkable, colors are natural and the sound design is impressive, giving the drones a unique personality and language (their \\"I require assistance\\" beacon sound will get quite a different meaning during the course of the story...).<br /><br />The film is enigmatic and thrilling during the first viewing, much clearer and evident the second time, and if you still require insight there's Tom Cruise's and Joe Kosinski's inartificial audio commentary for the entire length of the film. If you buy a film on video disc for repeated viewing, experience and enjoyment, then OBLIVION is most definitely my Number One recommendation during these days.<br /><br />If you're looking for fast-paced sci-fi action comic-strip-style I'd say that the latest STAR TREK reboot movie will be more to your liking. OBLIVION has plenty of good action scenes and visual eye candy (and can do without gore) but here these don't cover up the lack of an original story but rather serve to tell one that's good, thrilling and fresh. It's a passionate accomplishment I found incredibly entertaining and rewarding.
B000002HMH|2.0|Whoever says this album is awesome, best Metallica, brought more listeners in, etc. is just lame. They can be characterized as something that rhymes with a baggot. Anyway, this album gets 2 stars only because King Nothing and Until it Sleeps are OK songs, and only because 1 star is the equivalent to 0 (so 2 is equivalent to 1). Other than those 2 songs, this album sucks hard.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Great nods to the nerdier aspects of ones life, without being over eager or disrespectful. Pick it up, read it!
