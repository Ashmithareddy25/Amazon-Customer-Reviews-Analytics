B008QTV3X0|5.0|The characters are real - after six episodes, I feel like I know them.  Really good acting.  Interesting story line.  Not something I can watch right before bed!  For me, the best series of the season!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow. Just wow. I don't know what else to say about this book except it blew my mind. I bawled like a baby towards the end, Mr. Green ensnares you with his writing. Will definitely have to check out more of his books!
B008CX2A2I|1.0|This product doesn't have the range and is unreliable.<br />Read for a better and higher quality way of doing this.<br />First you buy a receiver that has good reviews on Amazon and then a USB to RCA connector for like $2 as I did. Another way is buying a Bluetooth receiver then connecting it to your CD slot at the back of your component receiver. Buy a HomeSpot, Bolse or a Logitech Bluetooth receiver (just search amazon for bluetooth receiver on Amazon and buy one that are rated close to 5 stars).<br />Then buy a RCA to USB connector; just search 'RCA to USB' on an auction or get some RCA cables and put it under PC. It's cheaper and higher quality.<br /><br />The long term benefits are that when your receiver goes obsolete so will this; a Bolse or Logitech won't go out of date soon or you can use it for something else.

B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Glossy w good special effects but weak writing and uninspired overall.  I enjoyed it with reservations; quality sort of a roller coaster ride.
B009GFEOY8|5.0|While it lacks the instantaneous nature of Polaroid due to the color protection properties, this film is still really interesting to work with, and makes great photos. It was also kind of interesting to play with in my SX-70. I'm tempted to buy more, but it's somewhat of an expensive proposition. Still, the photos are one of a kind, both literally and figuratively. :)
B001AZFO14|5.0|Under rated movie by critics is a fun ride for action junkies who love to see underdog good/bad guy win in the end.  Well-written, adequate special effects and believable action.  I'd have enjoyed the option of a sequel!

B008QI6EHQ|4.0|An insightful book on the issue of national socialism and the mindset behind this ideology. Nevertheless one should not be seduced by the vocabulary used by one of the best orators of the twentieth century. In the end national socialism was a murderous ideology.

B00FQPHOPI|4.0|Having watched Superman from childhood, I am always curious to see how the latest version will be interpreted.<br />Since I do not come with any expectation other than being entertained, I usually find the reviews to be a bit over the top.<br />I must say that Henry Cavill is the first Superman that did not need a breastplate-LOL. I could not believe my eyes when I saw him without a shirt.<br />This version seems to be directed towards a more mature audience (minimal explosions, crashes etc.) , which I greatly appreciated.<br />Although towards the end, I felt it was slipping off into the wackiness with the length of the fight scenes and the number of buildings demolished while the folks remained intact, still I enjoyed it and look forward to watching the bonus features. I would recommend it, especially if you are inclined to watch in the comfort of your home. I don't remember hearing any profanity, which is usually what most action flicks seem to rely on for dialogue, and I did not miss it either. I am sure that my grandkids will enjoy watching Man of Steel repeatedly so it's well worth the price.

1250037751|5.0|I have no idea how to classify this book. Is it mystery? Is it fantasy? Or is it, as George Saunders’s cover blurb claims, a fable? (Side note: Love him.) I’m not really sure where to place it. Let’s just call it a quality piece of fiction.<br /><br />This book sweeps you up and doesn’t require much effort without becoming overly simplistic. It’s about a guy named Clay who, after losing his job due to the recession, becomes preoccupied with increasing his number of marketable skills. Still unable to find a job in his field, he takes a job at Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore as a night clerk. The shop is mostly quiet, but every now and then a “member” comes in, not to make a purchase, but to borrow a volume from the restricted section. Clay is instructed to take detailed notes on the members when they loan their selected tomes: what they are wearing, what their mood seems like, etc., and he soon begins to wonder just what is going on at Mr. Penumbra’s shop.<br /><br />I don’t want to give too much away, because the reward is truly in seeking, not in finding, but Clay gets caught up in a quest to solve the bookstore’s biggest mystery. Along the way, he utilizes the services of his talented and eclectic cast of friends: Kat, who works at Google and believes that anything is possible; Neel, head of a CGI startup; and Mat, Industrial Light and Magic employee; among others.<br /><br />This book is so good that just writing about it makes me want to crack it open for a reread. Sloan’s writing is so effortless that you can’t help but get caught up in it, and Clay’s alternating brilliance and self-doubt make for a highly relatable protagonist. The scenes are set brilliantly: the technie scenes are as bright, squeaky-clean, and streamlined as an Apple store whereas the bookish ones are covered with layers of dust, indirect light, and magic.<br /><br />Although I loved many things about this book, perhaps my favorite is the fictional New York City bar, The Dolphin and Anchor. Here’s the description:<br />&#34;There’s a stack of books on the table and a metal cup with pointy pencils that smell fresh and sharp. In the stack, there are copies of Moby-Dick, Ulysses, The Invisible Man — this is a bar for bibliophiles.<br /><br />There’s a pale beer stain on the back cover of The Invisible Man, and inside, the margins are mobbed with pencil marks. It’s so dense you can barely see the paper behind it — there are dozens of different people’s marginalia jostling for space here.&#34;<br /><br />Um…I don’t know about you, but it’s a good thing I don’t live in New York because I would be at that bar every. single. night. if it existed. Why aren’t bars for bibliophiles a common thing?!<br /><br />Aaanyway. Back to Penumbra. This is one of the best books I’ve read in a while, soft yet strong, and I loved it.<br /><br />All in all: Worth reading. Worth buying. Just…worthy.<br /><br />I’ll leave you with one more favorite line:<br />“Some of them are working very hard indeed.”<br />“What are they doing?”<br />“My boy!” he said, eyebrows raised. As if nothing could be more obvious: “They are reading.”ar, The Dolphin and Anchor.

B0084TWN9K|3.0|Alice Munro has an interesting style.  She has the ability to draw one into her stories and characters.  It is unfortunate that she focuses on the dark side of life and the low points in the lives of her characters.  Woman who are weak and become victims usually of men--husbands, lovers or fathers are one of her favorite topics.  When one of her characters finds some joy, it is a very small amount of joy which in no way balances out the depressing story she has related about their life.
1554072840|5.0|I had this book growing up and was actually looking for it when it came time to potty train my daughter.  The book does a great job of walking the child through the steps of potty training and doesn't make them feel bad for having accidents.  My daughter has been potty trained fully for about a year now and she still pulls this book out for us to read it to her.
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|Trent is doing more great music, is not like all classic Downward Spiral or With Teeth but is a good album, it has some great songs and others that sound just like previous works like Goths or HTDA, and that' not bad is just that is not the characteristic NIN's sound. In general I think is a good album.
B0043RSK3K|4.0|An uncomfortable eye opener similar to Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. Recommended reading for people who wonder how we put our rational thought processes on hold during the WMD - Iraqi war campaign.

0545586178|5.0|I read Catching Fire, the second book in The Hunger Games Trilogy. Going into the second book after reading, and thoroughly enjoying, the first Hunger Games book, I was nervous it wouldn't meet my expectations. The Hunger Games set the level for the series high, and I was worried that the second book would not be able to complete with the first book. My fears disappeared when I started getting into Catching Fire. There was never a dull moment, and I found it just as entertaining as the first book.<br /> The book appeals to many different people. It is a mixture of action, drama, love, and suspense. Readers may feel sad and moved in some parts, while energized and pumped up in other parts.  Although it isn't like a Nicolas Sparks love story, it isn't violence and brawls the whole time either. The blend of genres allows people with different tastes for literature to enjoy this book. It is also easy to connect with Katniss, the main character. I found my emotions mirroring Katniss's emotions.<br /> Also, since Catching Fire is the second book in a trilogy, it is interesting to see questions answered from the first book, while there are also cliffhangers waiting to be answered  for the third book. Some questions surface, such as, \\"Who will Katniss choose, Peeta or Gale?\\" and \\"Who is going to still be alive in the next book?\\" You'll have to read to find out. \\"Happy Hunger Games! May the odds be ever in your favor!(Collins)\\"

B00BATG18K|2.0|Melodrama. That's  how I view Amy Tan's new novel The Valley of Amazement: 600 repetitive pages of melodrama! Too long, too repetitive, very disappointing.<br /><br />I struggled through The Valley of Amazement, but I didn't enjoy it. Set in Shanghai between 1900 and the late 1930s, the novel centers on two courtesans, mother and daughter. The first several hundred pages are narrated by the daughter, who is unaware of much of her own history. Nearly at the end, the mother's first-person account of her own story back-fills the tale. Both stories include lots of melodrama (tender husbands dead; children snatched away; many sorts of exploitation and mistreatment; riches-to-rags-to-riches plotlines). The choice of telling the story in reverse order seems awkward rather than suspenseful.<br /><br />In addition, both women's stories provide lurid descriptions of the life of a girl sold or otherwise forced into slavery. Yes, though each one lived in luxury, she was effectively a slave, and her life depended on learning to curb her own wishes and to please the men who bought her high-class favors. As a literary choice the subject of a Shanghai courtesan 100 years ago could go in a number of directions, but I think this one didn't turn out well.<br /><br />Sorry, Amy Tan, I've loved almost all of  your other novels. This one didn't come up to any of the previous ones I've read.  I see the earlier amazon.com reviews are coming in to agree with me.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Panther is interesting and well written; the feature character, John Corey, comes across as a bit too juvenile for my liking ... not what I thought was among the best of DeMille's works ...
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Great movie to clearly explain the tensions in the pre revolutionary  colonies! My middle schoolers loved watching a dramatization of the French and Indian war - historically accurate or not.
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|As always, Bill Bryson is a great storyteller, who gives us stories that we may never have heard of, or of a different perspective on a familiar story, such as Babe Ruth hitting 60 home runs,<br />A good read.  Not as all encompassing as &#34;Home&#34; or &#34;A Brief History,&#34; but a good read nonetheless.

B004I744AS|4.0|Just hope that this app would automatically detect your connection to search instead of changing it yourself. Overall a pretty good app.
B000FC10MU|4.0|An interesting premise with interesting characters for sure. Gaiman's writing style is on par with something like \\"The Sandman Series\\" where you feel like you're in a world where you are seeing what's mostly happening but there are a lot of other tales that could be told to flesh out the universe a bit more. Not to say this book is short by any means. Shadow and Wednesday are very interesting and the supporting characters are fun. You may come away with a different favorite then other people. Even Gaiman has a favorite but I can't really understand why (Easter is his FYI).<br /><br />Don't expect a ton of explanation or revelation, even towards the end. There are many loose threads that you do not find the answer to. Sometimes, I'm completely fine with that as it allow me to come up with my own theories. This books may have a bit too many for me. For example, an unnecessary and unexplained gay Genie sex scene that comes from left field and leaves in the same exact manner.<br /><br />I was expecting a lot more of an ending but it seemed just to kind of peter out and a loss of epicness that had been building up seemed to just shrug it shoulders and skip out on itself.<br /><br />Overall, a decent book that was fun to read with a few hiccups. Pretty much a standard for Gaiman's writing. Final Grade - B
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I use this often on my Kindle Fire HD and it works great. I would recommend this app to anyone.

B004UJTG6Q|2.0|I tried reading this book and found it very difficult to follow because of the words, phrases, and terms that they had way back in the 1800's when the book was written.  I gave up and never finished the book.
1439560803|5.0|Amazing book! I was drawn in within the first 15 pages, and held ever after. There were several times when I had to ask others to wait a moment while I finished a particular passage. The way Patrick writes is interesting, descriptive, and beautiful. Kvothe is easily one of the coolest characters ever -- right up there with Drizzt Do'Urden -- and the secondary characters are also well-rounded and easy to understand. I often found my heard beating faster or that I was holding the Kindle inches from my face as I frantically tore through the story, unable to stop. LOVE LOVE LOVE this book, can't wait to read the next one!

B008NB0SQO|2.0|When the first DVD came out the song was on it and gave you the option of skipping the song or watching it with it. I love the song and agree with most it needs to be in the movie. At least let us decide if we want it or not. Quite messing up great movies and rerelease on Blu-ray with the option Disney. With that said try to find the first release. This is still one of my favorite movies and versions of this movie. I have them all. This is for the whole family and still gets me to smile.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I bought the book because of all the hype, and the only reason I bought the other two was because I wanted to finish the trilogy just to see where it was going.  It went nowhere but right back to the beginning.  I love books with story line and substance.  This was just too annoying after awhile.  The book to buy, and it's an oldie, is &#34;The Other Side of Midnight&#34; by Sidney Sheldon.  Now that was a book that had it all including a story line.

B00D2JDNQ4|5.0|I am a third of the way through this marvellous read. The language is intricately written for the setting and the characters' voices are beautifully orchestrated into this past time. Even the it is a slow read because of the period language, it is a page turner. The setting in New Zealand in the 18th century subsumes the reader into the intriguing mystery that unfolds through the dialogue. At times the reader is comfortably placed in the harshness of this landscape and at other times the reader will feel foreign to it as the writer intended. I am absorbed and want to know the outcome of the mystery. Eleanor Catton has clearly written a long novel of intrigue about her homeland. I highly recommend this book.

B00EEPFRGE|5.0|There were the fluro colored parachute pants, the big screaming hairdos, the first appearance of music on a shinning plate called CD, the rise of wholesome family fuzzy TV shows such as the Cosby Show, the emerging popularity of video games, and then there was Stryper.  The 80s was certainly a decade for us to be nostalgic about.  Though many things that were patented about the decade are already a transient memory, Stryper is not.  Taking their name from the KJV of Isaiah 53:5,  Stryper's drummer Robert Sweet also created a backronym for their name, \\"salvation through redemption, yielding peace, encouragement and righteousness.\\"  Stryper is never reticent about their faith.  Rather, what has set them apart from their metallic rock peers such as Def Leppard, Van Halen and Bon Jovi is that the message of faith that is always at the front and center of their songs. Dressed in black and yellow outfits, they would even go further by tossing out Bibles in their concerts.  Yet, despite their message, Stryper became hugely successful starting with their sophomore album \\"To Hell with the Devil.\\" This is one of the few Christian rock albums to achieve Platinum status selling over a million copies in the US alone in 1986.<br /><br />However when the 90s rolled around, with the advent popularity of stripped down rock, thrash metal and post-grunge, the death knell was starting to ring for many pop-metal bands.  Stryper too felt the strain to accommodate. Thus, with their 1990 album \\"Against the Law,\\" the band made some concessions but the changes were far too radical for fans to accept.  Not long after, with the ensuing departure of lead singer Michael Sweet, the band finally called it quits in 1992.  However, at the turn of the millennium with a resurging interest back to the nostalgic sounds of the 80s and the loyalty of the band's legions of fans, Stryper has been back.  Having signed a multi-album deal with Frontiers Records, they have issued a re-recording of their older hits (with 2 new songs) entitled \\"Second Coming\\" earlier this year.  And now they are back with their long awaited Frontiers Records debut of entirely newly recorded songs.<br /><br />While many artists who had started off in the 80s feel like they have moved with the times by incorporating a new computerized cut and paste sound, you won't find such doltish compromise here. \\"No More Hell to Pay\\" has that loud glam metallic roar that fans have been waiting for since the 1980s.  This album, which features one cover and 11 originals coming mostly from Michael Sweet's pen, has everything fans have loved about the band. \\"Revelation,\\" which kicks off the album, is indicative of the record.  Sweet's high falsetto vocals, rifting guitars and the bold faith-centered message are all intact.  Lyrically, \\"Revelation\\" is a masterpiece:  it brilliantly uses images from the book of Revelation as a call for all of us to repent.  While the title cut \\"No More Hell to Pay\\" speaks about an unwavering trust to follow Jesus despite of all the doubting voices that might surround us.  With a track like \\"Saved By Love,\\" Stryper has certainly eradicated the common (mis)conception that heavy metal is often associated with Beelzebub, as they could not have presented the Gospel with greater perspicuity.<br /><br />Interestingly, the only cover here is Arthur Reid Reynolds' \\"Jesus is Just Alright,\\" a song popularized by the Doobie Brothers.  However, fans of Contemporary Christian music would have also remembered that DC Talk had a cover of the same song way back in 1992.  The Stryper has certainly heightened the rock elements of the song but most exquisite is their tight harmonies that radically transform this folk song into a faith-affirming anthem.  Perhaps the only drawback of this record is the dearth of big ballads such as \\"Honestly\\" and \\"Always There for You.\\"  The only time the tempo decelerates is with \\"The One;\\" a couple of ballads would certainly have shuffled the album's pace a little.  Nevertheless, if you are looking for copious dueling guitar solos, enormous melodic hooks, locomotive drumming and lots of loud passionate singing (with a few screams thrown in), \\"No More Hell to Pay\\" won't disappoint..

He makes you look at the world around you in a new and memorable way. In \\"The Book Thief\\" he's taken a dark subject and covered it with his beautiful words and similes without hiding the horrors contained therein.  I'm a voracious reader...I read a book and usually go on to the next book without much thought...but \\"The Book Thief\\" has become my all-time favorite book.  Right now I can't even bring myself to delete it from the index page of my Kindle, at least until I've added his other books to the list.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|very fun to play. a great way to kill time. just wish there was more levels. otherwise. I would of gave it five stars
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am a horse lover and I ride them and its a great game for all ages . But I wish there were palemienos .and stuff to be cheaper.I hope you can enjoy this game!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|A great app to connect to facebook when I am away from home. It helps me keep in touch with important events with my family and friends
B002BU0DPE|4.0|Had to buy the female jacks for it, that was not specified in the sale that I would need to purchase! Should have said that I would have to buy them and I would have gave 5 stars!
B0063GORYU|5.0|WARNING: This game in highly addictive. That is what should be added to its profile because me and several other people I know play for hours once we start a game. I love this game and play it almost every day.
B003G4W49C|3.0|It was a quick, easy read. It was a good story line with interesting characters. It did leave a lot to the imagination, though. I will definetly read the next one.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|Great movie, better than the last Dredd movie. I would suggest this to others to watch. A must see movie
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its a great game to play. I normally play right after I use all my lives up in candy crush lol it helps to cope
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my son plays this game all the time and his brother likes to watch.  I also enjoy playing this game from time to time.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The characters are not all lovable but their descriptions and characteristics fit the story perfectly. With each chapter you are never sure that the flawed personalities will come through, sort of a roller coaster of emotions constrained by the urgency of a trial that waits for no one. Loved the book.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Great show,it is the best on tv so far, zombies are looking more real than before,every body I talk to  are already watching  it  too.
B001V7YJMG|5.0|Great movie. Not too scary or gory. Well acted with a mix of terror and intrigue. You'll need to read the subtitles but it is worth it!
B008JFUS28|5.0|I loved this movie even more than the first! Everybody was so funny. There were a few plot holes, but seriously who the hell cares?! It was just so good! Really wish they would make a Loki movie! More Loki!
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Doesn't match the interface of other free apps for reading.  For example there's no brightness control, no night reading mode.  Lack of flexibility in settings, generally.  But it works smoothly.Interfaces with the amazon kindle market nicely.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you like temple run or subway surfer type games you will love this game it is basically subway surfers with your favorite minions. I recommend for all ages.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Interesting writing style. This book covers much about the history of Afghanistan that I never knew.  We chose this book for our book club.
B00GLMQREE|5.0|My favorite show, almost every episode is fantastic. Very good acting and grim atmosphere. Makes me appreciate ordinary things, from electricity to hot showers.
B00338QENI|5.0|Wow! I never realized that there was a problem with medical consents until I read this book. Goes to show that the majority of the population has been uninformed.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|Fast service. As described. Price was right. Great movie. Love the acting and customs in the movie. Would recommend this DVD to my friends.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Reads like a smart Barbara Cartland novel but couldn't put it down.  A really touching story which examines the feelings and rights of the disabled in an intelligent way.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|This is an hysterically funny picture that you can watch over and over. If you think you're tired of it and bump into it somehow, you're caught!
B001HN694K|4.0|Bought this for my daughter.  Her dance class is doing a theater production of Alice and she wanted to see the whole story.  She has watched it several times so far.
1250038820|5.0|Amazing album! So many beautiful stories of so many people. Many of them made me laugh and cry. Brandon Stanton visualised pure emotions. I have never been in NYC but thanks to this great book I feel like we all belong there.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|This product is great value and does what it is supposed to do. I like the white look and compact design aspect.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|This book is great fun.  Don, the hero, is  an interesting, if slightly weird hero and is very funny.  A very easy read.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I have been a voracious reader since the tender age of two, and my criteria for rating reading material is admittedly rather particular.  I can honestly say with no reservations that this book was not only a fascinating, introspective journey into the largely uncharted capabilities of the human mind and psyche; additionally it provides hard science in the form of quantum physics to support the notion that \\"if you can dream it, anything is possible\\" and that we are all interconnected.  If you are interested in self-help books and the notion that our limited perception and operant conditioning through largely arbitrary societal rules of behavior and ways of thinking ( coupled with ceaseless propaganda) regarding how we should look, dress, eat, feel ad nauseam....then I encourage you to read this book, perform the examples, and perhaps most importantly, make a concerted effort to clear your mind of clutter and really open your mind (and spirit) to the material.  One final thing....in no way does this book adopt a kooky, far-out New Age slant; rather, the information contained within is compatible with virtually all major religions and beliefs.  Can't wait to read more from the author, as well as similar works!
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|I have enjoyed several of Khaled Hosseini's books and this was no exception.  A family saga spanning continents and times with sympathetic characters
0767853636|5.0|I love this version of the musical!  Great all-star cast, and my students liked the widescreen edition.  Quality is really good too.
B00BXI0IHS|4.0|A fascinating Heroine<br /><br />This book is a terrific read of tremendous breadth with well drawn and interesting characters..  I devoured it.
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|You can watch it again and again.  Either I'm starting to turn into my kids (who can watch a movie over and over) or this was just a good movie that you can watch time and time again.
B00FCAK12A|5.0|It's hard to deny that As The Palaces Burn from Lamb Of God is one of the best metal albums ever created. But it's not hard to deny that the the overall production of the album suffered in the end as it is documented on the bonus DVD that is included in the 10th Anniversary edition. Kudos to all who tried to make it sound the best that it could, but double kudos to Josh Wilbur (Wrath and Resolution producer) who undertook the task of remixing this beast. The remixing and remastering of the album was never on my mind because when you love an album, you never think \\"oh it could better.\\" That never hit me until I recently found out about it. The end result isn't a totally new album by any means, but it's a more clearer sounding album now. Certain things that were lost during post-production now are restored and can be heard. For years, Soilwork's Natural Born Chaos was always my favorite Devin Townsend production. This album comes pretty close now. Anyone that needs a little convincing to buy this, go back to the original and compare both versions. It's just like when Shadows Fall's Of One Blood got remixed and remastered. That was a good album with terrible sound quality, and now it shines. The DVD is also worth watching as you get to understand the band's way of working at that point in time compared to how they work today.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Castle is a fun show to watch. I enjoy Nathan Fillion and the all of the cast.  He is fun and entertaining.
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|Very well made. Lots of action with a unique story. Kept you on the edge of your seat. My husband and I liked it equally.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|I don't like reviewing movies because I am not a professional movie critic and I don't pretend to be so for that I refer you to professional websites that review movies so all I can say is that in my opinion this is an absolutely wonderful heartwarming and funny movie that the whole family can watch without fear of violence or sex or foul language but at the same time they don't dumb it down to where only small children will enjoy it for this is a rare movie to where at least in my opinion adults will enjoy as much as children.
B00C061I3K|5.0|It's Daft Punk, need I say more?  Where this breaks from their more commonly heard tracks, Random Access Memories is a great solid album.  Although the album version of &#34;Get Lucky&#34; is a lot longer and sounds slightly different than the breaks in the radio edit version.
B0041G67YW|5.0|it's very difficult to rate a movie because I am by no means a professional movie critic and I have no intention of pretending to be one and that being said this is one of my all-time favorite movies because I hate movies that you know what is going to happen 20 min. before does and this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing what is going to happen next but continually define yourself making wrong assumptions which makes watching it very fun and the acting and actors and it do a superb job and sense everybody has an opinion and one man's treasure is another man's junk you will have to watch it for yourself and make your own decision but in my book this is a really good movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play so much. I run out of time. Can't wait to play. Again and again. It is a great way to make the train commute go faster.
0316322407|5.0|This was a very informative and interesting book. I would recommend this to my friends and family. Malala is an amazing girl!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest. It has everything you would need, and for anything you're looking for. The best ideas for anything too.
193700788X|2.0|The shipping of the book was fine, and I will continue to receive my books thru amazon. I was very disappointed in the book itself and the way the author ended the story of some of my favorite characters. I believe she wasn't consisitent in keeping with the character development. She went against many things that she built her characters up to be, my main disappointment was Erik and Sookie.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I loved learning about Henry ViIi. I couldn't stop thinking about it and had to watch the entire 4 seasons in two weeks.
B00CHS31DG|1.0|No directions or help and uses to many resources to be of any value.  Do not waste your time and or money. Biggest waste I have ever downloaded.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Very addictive! Very fun! Easy to pick and play without getting sucked into it for hours. It's a great time killer.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Amazing book.  Would recommend to anyone, except for some teens or younger because of the dark, sexually explicit experience in the novel.  Otherwise, great writing, great story, keeps you gripped and reading on and on.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Really great idea, but with limited options. I really like this and want to love it but it needs more supported apps. It'd be nice if Google would stop breaking 3rd party apps which allow this to be used more freely. The price is right but if you really want to stream all your entertainment go with a Roku.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I loved these books the first time I read them and loved them enough to buy them again for my kindle so I can read them whenever I wish.  Highly recommend, although, this series as a whole maybe is not appropriate for some teens or younger.
B00005NKK8|5.0|Just listened to it entirely today,and was very happy. You just (NEVER) know What you will find digging through thang's,that someone else NO longer wants.And a Great cd to add too my Huge collection of music of Albums,cds,45s,and Cassettes. pedro.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|It works well enough as a doctor who prop and cool little whovian thing to have.<br /><br />My only complaint it that this particular Sonic Screwdriver has 4 sound effects. Two of which are the typical high and low buzz of Tennant's Screwdriver. But the other two are some really generic Sci-Fi sounds.<br /><br />The worst part of it is, each time you press the button it toggles the 4 sounds, and there's no way to skip the 2 irritating ones.<br /><br />Slightly disappointed. But not enough to go through the hassle of making a return and buying another.
B00DXP7L88|2.0|I've loved this series.  More than any show other than Buffy.  I was into this until the very end.  But then the series finale...I felt betrayed.  It has tainted my feelings towards the show.  An incredibly disappointing and idiotic ending.  I'm still appalled by it and it has been months since it aired.  I was planning on buying the entire series in the complete Blu-Ray packaging the day it came out (I have 1-7 on DVD), but I am willing to put it off for now.  I just haven't forgiven them yet for what they've done to me.
B00AB65SVE|5.0|this show is hilarious. i would recomend this show to anyone, pure comedy all episode long. jay is the man.
B005JABSB6|3.0|Sharp 3D TV changed their 3D glasses sometime in 2013. Original Sharp TV used In-fared. The newer version uses Radio Frequency. Unfortunately when I ordered these I was not aware of the change. Corresponding with the seller we could not find out why they did not work. I even returned to the Store where I purchased the TV but they did not know why the glasses would not work. Further exploring on the internet I found there had been a change by Sharp. I found the correct 3D glasses for Radio Frequency and they worked fine.
B004P7CMDM|5.0|Shipping was on time, loved the first crow, so I HAD to purchase this set!! Just a fair warning to anyone that doesn't  know this is part 2 and 4 not 3! But I still recommend it because who can beat the price of 2 for 1? &#60;3 thanks!!<br /><br />1. The Crow<br />2. the Crow: City of Angels (in this set)<br />3. the Crow: Salvation<br />4. The Crow: Wicked Prayer (in this set)
B00E0SX118|5.0|Loved it; it is silly, sassy and still sweet :) plus I had fun trying to identify all the famous voices!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I suggest reading this book, it is my all time favorite and I recommend it to everyone. I have read it a whole bunch of times.
0811870413|5.0|I am an amateur Bread Maker.  After buying this book and following directions, I feel I am approaching status as a Professional.  My first loaf was outstanding and I continue to get better.  The day-old Bread recipes are fantastic.  I never thought I would enjoy Fried Bread, but it is delicious.
B00336G7HI|1.0|This said it would fit in my Sony A230.  It did not.  I opened the packaging and charged the battery only to find that it is too thick to fit in my Sony A230.  My camera is fine but the advertising that it would fit my camera is false.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|All the movies are timeless, well done and do justice to the wonderful book series.  Perfect complement to the book.
B000FC12Z0|5.0|Takes you on the train, I love a good &#34;who done it!&#34; I enjoyed trying to figure out the way Poirot always gets his man, or woman.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it. Hard to put down.  Play each time till lives run out.  Some levels take weeks to get completed
B00DDQTKHM|5.0|It's a very clear and complete book about how to design and implemenent a marketing campaign using the tools that internet offers currently. For someone like me, who didn't have any previous knwoledge on marketing or PR, It is a very enlightening reading.<br /><br />Es un libro muy claro y completo sobre el diseño y la implementación de una campaña de mercadeo a través de internet. Para alguien que no tiene conocimientos previos en mercadeo o relaciones públicas, es un libro muy esclarecedor.
0679882820|3.0|I was extremely disappointed with the size.  I was expecting it to be at least 8 1/2 x 11.  I felt you charged more than what I would have paid in the store.
B00CO4GO7I|1.0|First off, I know Chris Kyle died and my review is not meant to offend, but if you are an American and did not like this book, you are still an American. Bought this because I was interested in the life of a sniper. This was horrible. I did not expect such bad storytelling. The narrative was childlike. The characters were not developed, and you really didn't care. Throughout the book instead of naming people, he would say 'let's just call this guy Mike or John or Bill'  to protect the person identity. Really? Like anyone would know these people anyway. This was mostly about the author, though. Chris Kyle. Just from the writing, it sounds like Chris Kyle is nothing but a sociopath who lacks any empathy for anyone who is not in the military. He leaves his wife and children behind to re-enlist more than once. He likes to get into bar fights and would enjoy beating people up. He is a legend in his own mind.  A devout religious guy who has God on his side.  He likes to kill savages. He states that he really didn't give a s*** about the Iraq people or their struggle or anything else. This is all according to him I'm not putting words in his mouth, read the book he makes it clear that killing is just OK with him because he is saving Americans. Good thing we went to war and had this guy around. That being said. He should have hired a ghostwriter. Really it was just hard to read.  The whole book was 'and then I went here, and then I went there, and then I did this' If you like stories that make a bit of sense, then skip this one. Thanks for your service Chris and everyone who selflessly did there job.  UPDATE 2016 Just a reminder, this is a personal review. I reviewed a book. This was not a personal attack on you or your beliefs. If you feel you have been personally attacked then that's on you. Amazon is not the forum to use if you disagree with someone's opinion about a  product. Save that for your Facebook page, blog, twitter account or any other form of social media to get your two cents in. Have some restraint and couth.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Mind games; interesting until you run into a problem that you have trouble understanding what the clue represents and how to decipher it.  Yes, I am stuck on one of the levels, but have not given up.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|There were great twists in the plot. The development of each set of characters was interesting. I enjoyed when they all began to tie together.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love candy crush, very addictive. The only thing I don't like is that I have pay to move on to the next episode. I don't want to connect to Facebook, so that forces me to pay to move on.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Doesn't work with my dektop, which is what I wanted it for.  Really messed up our wireless system. Very disappointed.
B0002KQNJU|3.0|It feels dated...cause so many movies took directly from the scenes in it...The humor is slap stick...and i liked it...
B008220BLG|5.0|Hey Its Sunnydale Chick, and I REALLY liked this movie.....the book; not so much.....Now I usually read the whole book, don't get me wrong.....and I was Excited to read this...but I couldn't get past the 1st chapter. It Doesn't add up right. For anyone who wants to know.....it's confusing. It started out the same(I usually see movies 1st then read the book) but then he has a wife/girlfriend.....they don't explain it and I'll bet she's not mentioned in the book again (but THAT'S a plus (now if they would've done something like that with the aunt in the Are you afraid of the Dark episode The Dollmaker-I wrote about this in another review.) Now that's all I'm going to say of the book (again proving my point that even though I DO love books...they aren't Always better then the movies......that's just like an old saying that's not REALLY true (but then I've NEVER gone by what everyone else says anyway.....life's better when you live by your own rules, which is ALSO like the movie (and has been a way of my life since I was a kid....I'm suggesting it for my readers as well) and I LOVE how this movie is like another modern day Romeo and Juliet....I've got the one with Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. That one's Dark and gothic, this one's funny and dark/gothic. And I think they're both great movies!!
B008Y6YCB0|4.0|Enjoyable couple of hours.  Dialogue a little hard to understand sometimes - don't know if it was the film itself or our streaming of it.
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|Amazing Movie I wish it had a cast commentary is all but beggars can't be choosers. I love all of the extended scenes. I love the packaging as well, really pretty, fits in wall with the rest of the extended DVDs.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|got it on time. can put in uv. great story for old and new fans. old fans will like the enemy.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|EXCELLENT!! Love this movie. Action, great story line, & funny to boot! I've seen it now at least three times & it doesn't grow old.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|great group going into the influence of lcd soundsystem. lcd produced. a little bit disco. first song reminds me of blonde.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|My little boy loves this! he can just jump his little heart out. There are plenty of toys on it to keep his attention. Shipping was fast.
1936891026|3.0|In general I  liked this little book. Pressfield did a good job laying out the difficulties of working in a creative profession. There were times, however that I felt he would have done better to narrow his scope and let the reader make their own applications. There were times that he was so general in his approach that, for me at least, it lost a lot of it's punch. Really I would have given it four stars, but the last section for me just wasn't that good, and that was the practical part.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Unusual start but keep reading..thoroughly enjoyed this most intriguing book......made into a movie now and will definitely go and see it.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Duh. Who doesn't love the Big Bang. It's a must season for the collector or anyone who enjoys good old nerdy fun.
0316322407|5.0|This young woman is an inspiration to young girls her age and the support of her family is also an inspiring story.  My 17 year old granddaughter is looking forward to reading the story of Malala.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is the one of the few movies which I will add to my best of the world collections.<br />It is difficult to say that movie arts dying when you see this one.<br />This is will become classic of the 21 century!
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|Grandson loves this video. I was able to down load the video in less than 2 minutes.  Fast easy and accessible.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Poor editing throughout the novel distracted from what was a good story line, otherwise it was interesting with good characters.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a book I want to read with my students. So much depth and lots to discuss. Read the introduction, too!
B004ZISVRW|4.0|Movie had half-way decent special effects and was funny enough to be watchable. A good one to watch on &#34;bad movie day&#34;.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|Informative and inspirational from a very courageous young woman.  Her father is to be commended for his bravery as well, in educating children,as well as his daughter.  The world is better for both of them being in it.
0316322407|5.0|I'm only half way through this book and can't stop thinking about how everyone I know needs to read it. Her knowledge and compassion (especially for a teenager!!) is overwhelming. And she can tell a story! I've received more education about the area and their culture than I have with any other book I've read on the subject. What an inspiring book.
B003VIWZNS|5.0|It was a story I can relate to. This was real life in your face and everyday stuff. actors top notch.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I was at chapter 4 (magic) and now I'm at technology and I only have void in technology I really hope they fix this I was like 30 elements away from completing it for now I'll rate it 1 star I'll change if they fix
B004SIP7AS|5.0|One of my favortie movies! Sent to my sister who is recovering from a fall and thought it would be some company for her!
B0019NB9A2|5.0|This is another great sci fi flick everyboady should have with Star Trek movies and all the series on bluray nothing realy a  lot to say but the picture is top notch buy it on bluray buy it now
B0010SEMP0|3.0|It was better than the first one that I read by this author, but it didn't keep my attention well. Bones is by far the best character...none of the others seem very well developed.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Awesome series!  Creepy and scary!!  Mostly great actors and a story line of survivorship mentality!  Good ideas for banding together and preparing for the worst!  My daughter and I are glued to the series when we get it in video cause we don't have cable.
B00C9G22R2|4.0|you never know what to expect from a movie from asia. the two ip man movies with donnie yen set the standard. i was leary that this film might be one of those repackaged, get rich quick schemes, but thankfully, a rather pleasant surprise. the grandmaster was not available in theaters locally, so this was just as good.
B000HZEPAE|5.0|Best movie ever made. The funniest movie I have ever seen. Laughed so hard I pooped a little bit. Hahahaha
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Good to hear a fresh rapper instead of the same old tired stuff you hear everywhere. Different is good in this case.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|The game is shoot off fun, they keep using it when they think it needs it.  Every update I have gotten so far have given more to me to have fun and enjoy when I have nothing to do. I have had this game since I got my Kindle last Christmas. I hope the add more
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|So inspirational, and she really takes you to the PCT with all her details. It's a must-read for every woman that has wanted to go on a self-defining trip alone but is too afraid to do it, and for everybody that wants to get a glimpse into the life of a strong and independent woman.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really like this game. It  really fun and my brothers and I love it! Yo should get it. Its worth the time!
1401938906|5.0|This book is AWESOME. Life changing. Well written and light hearted, it is funny and an easy read. I suggest buying it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love candy crush, love the fact that the app is free but the game is very addicting. All in all if you love challenges and advancing to the hundreds of levels candy crush has to offer then this app is for you. I give this app a 5 star!
B00C5R8364|5.0|Forsyth is a tried and true thriller master.  Good story, plausible story line and characters.  Tight development of lots of action.  Very satisfying conclusion.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I thought if w as s great. The chemistry with Abby and Travis is like no other. Why do they, we, us have to fight it?  It would make things easier. I recommend this book. Such a beautiful disaster!!!!!
B0095VPAVE|5.0|This is my set up:<br />This APU<br />MSI FM2-A85XA-G43<br />Corsair CX600<br />Kingston Value RAM 1600 MHz 8 GB<br />NZXT Phantom Full ATX Black<br />LG DVD Writer GH24NS90<br />Seagate Barracuda SATA II 7200 RPM 500GB<br />and an old Acer V173 that I already had<br /><br />This APU is great.  It runs Oracle Virtual Box Great.  No errors with Fedora 13.  I am having issues with ISO copies I made of Fedora 19 but I think that is corrupt data on the DVD from using am usb DVD drive on a laptop.  It is fast and efficient.  It comes with two physical cores and it turns into Four Logical Cores.  They are counting logical cores.  There are four threads on this machine.  In Device Manager it shows 4 cores. Despite that it is great. Don't crap on AMD.  The original benchmarks on this core favored Intel because it fully supported Intel technology.  This core is better than I3 don't let Intel junkies tell you otherwise. The integrated graphics good.  Pair it with another graphics card and you can get better.  You want something that beats I7 3770k without paying $219 buy AMD FX 8530 it is better than the i7 3770k.  Latest benchmarks for this cpu support this. I have had no trouble with this core the core runs fine. Update older monitors drivers to avoid flicker.
B005R32L66|5.0|just give a reason just a little its enough just a second were not broken just bent and we can learn to love again.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|lacks the simplicity of youtube, tries to pack in too much crap and has adds. if you want youtube on steroids you can do a lot better than this. the design of integrated features is a mess
B0093FNZT6|5.0|Well written, insightful and worth reading. Great to read a book about the afterlife from the point of view of a scientific/medical professional.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally available for my Kindle Love the game but drives me crazy sometimes but I always come back for more lol
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Everyone needs to read this book. It is so lovely and so eloquently written. I've never falling more in love with a book.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Better than the PC version!! This one doesn't freeze and consistent loads. Loving this! I highly recommend this version of the game if you love Castleville online!
B0040I09RM|4.0|The acting is top-notch, the production quality is good, characters have depth and the stories are well-written with believable dialog and professional use of all the usual tools of story-telling and video production.  The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because the kill rate (based on the first 10 episodes) far exceeds what would be sustainable for any organization today, ouside of the US military at war.  It's quite gory and violent in almost every episode, making it unbelievable.  The Sons of Anarchy as portrayed here could not exist in the virtual police-state of California/U.S. that we know today, yet the series is set in the present day.  Yes, gang wars and hits happen, but not everyday.  A more realistic portrayal would be better.  Just a few murders per season would be sufficient, instead of 2 or 3 every episode.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|it did not work properly and you cannot refund it. I suggest just getting it off of google play. gettining it is confusing and combersome for less service. :C
B0080MJYR0|2.0|Mildly entertaining, mostly due to fun/kitschy set design and costumes.  Nothing in the story is remotely interesting.  The best way to experience this movie is to put it on the large screen, on mute, during your next house party.
B00065JTBA|5.0|I spent many years searching for this album and finally found it. I feel very happy! I recommend this album to all Bon Jovi fans.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so darn addicting. When you get a hard level, check out the helper blogs for suggestions and keep trying. If you don't buy anything else, get the 3 lollipops at the top. Great help when you just need one candy left. Have fun and look up occasionally.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|I love Bon Jovi and finally have the new album with me. I'm very happy with my purchase! Thank you.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Great app!! Very clear and easy to use. Really like the process! In just a few days I know some basic phrases...i believe there is a strengthen what you've learned area but i have yet to use it. DEF worth getting!!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Follett is back in form.  I thing nowadays he is only interested in historical fiction.  His last two pure fiction books were written by formula and were totally predictable.  Very much worth the read.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|The Good Wife continues its previous season's strong storylines with compelling viewing.  At times funny, touching and suspenseful, they continue to keep the show fresh.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|This is a masterpiece. All the stories are fantastic, and it's a very good way into reading for kids: show them the Disney movie, then present the book.
B008CX2A2I|1.0|Didn't work for me, am a bit disappointed. Tried several times. I did get the UWF-1 Wireless Lan to work, so now I use Sirius XM internet radio
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|One of the best books i have ever rea, without question!  Worth every cent for the ides and thought it provokes.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|Pro's: Amazing sound quality, great old-fashioned design ensures it was built to last. I read somewhere that &#34;they don't make headphones like this anymore,&#34; and now I believe it. Pretty comfortable as well.<br /><br />Con's: My ears might be a bit too big, but it bothers me (only slightly) that my ears press up against the inner part of the headphone. Maybe it's supposed to be that way? I'm not sure. I don't believe I've tried to listen to a .flac file with these, but they seem to lack a bit of bass. Also, a non-detachable cable is a huuuuge downside for me; my cord's always go out after a year of use, so it's almost a must for any of my headphone purchases to include a replaceable cord. Only way around that is to be extremely handy with a sauteing iron. It is possible to mod it to have a removable cord, but be very careful not to ruin such a great investment.<br /><br />Even if it's bass is a bit low, it has quite possibly the best sound in every other regard, highly confortable, and if your careful, can mod it to be one of the best pair of headphones you could own for the money.
0399161287|5.0|one of the most honest human beings  period. the most compelling Athlete over the past 30 years easily.  Mike Tyson was the people's Champ and he has a realness about him which is so raw that it just  moves you.  this book pulls no punches and knocks you on your back. you will laugh, feel the emotion,hurt, pain and bitterness.  the man  had to deal with battling in and out of the ring. his money, his freedom and his personal life were all front row seat. before a internet and the various social media, you knew about Iron Mike and what he was going through and dealing with.  so many stories and so much going on. what a life  and  what a story and the man is still  so young and you would think he had lived an additional 40 years to his life.<br /><br />he keeps it real and  you gotta admire that about the man.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was a pleasant surprise! What I thought would be a predictable story turned out to surprise me and genuinely entertain this young mom.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Well written - the new characters are great and the story give so many details - much more interesting to read before you watch the movie.
B008HTQ28K|4.0|Personal, I do not like crooks to get away with it. The story was quite interesting even if  a bit unreal.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Easy to  install but not user friendly for selecting video sources. Also disappointing that Amazon prime wasn't listed as an available resource. I will hang on to it and see what refinements are made over time.
030746363X|5.0|I am a 28 year old woman who heard about this book from my fiance.  100 days out from my wedding, I decided to read it and implement the changes Tim Ferriss suggests into my daily life.  I write this now 3 days before my wedding.  I am down 15 pounds and lost 11 inches total in my body.  I started at 145 lbs and was already \\"in shape\\", so I think this loss is pretty significant and speaks to the books' success.  It is challenging, but totally work it to try this diet.  He knows what he is talking about.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Original story. Had heard great reviews and wanted to see it for myself.<br />Wonderful acting and loved the different episodes.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|Love Jack Johnson and this album is fantastic--true to his style and form. My kids even love singing along to the songs.
630542845X|5.0|Great movie. One of those that the whole family can watch. A movie you will<br />watch more than one time..
B008JFUPK8|2.0|I have waited so long for this movie to come out on DVD and was sitting in the window waiting for the mail lady to come and bring me my DVD today!  (I pre-ordered it the minute I could, which was about 4 months ago - shame on you Amazon for doing that! That is too long!!)  Anyway, I got my popcorn and soda ready, turned the phone off, and was ready to enjoy what I had heard was finally a great Superman movie.  REALLY??!!  Did I just get the special effects version that totally sucked?  Maybe it was just me that got the version that had absolutely no plot, no story line and just lots of a beautiful man in a tight uniform fly around and let towns and cities be destroyed.  Lois Lane met him for about 3 minutes before she became \\"the one\\".<br />The actors did a great job, the CGI was good but became too much after a while.  When Zod was somehow (story line lacked and I got bored - forgive me) still on Earth after Superman had \\"won\\" the battle, I just turned it off.  I was ready to watch water boil at that point and had no interest in spending another minute watching this major FAIL of a movie.<br />DC is getting their butts kicked by their rival studio because they don't seem to realize that the public wants more than just CGI.  You need a good script too.  What I don't understand is that if you watch the animated DC movies, they are usually excellent!  Why not adapt one of those?<br />Overall, I am sincerely disappointed in the movie and can't believe I couldn't even finish it.  The last time I couldn't watch a movie to the end was \\"The Beverly Hillbillies.\\"  Try watching it for a few minutes and you'll understand why I tried to be nice and give this piece of rot a 2.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Very entertaining movie!  A bit disjointed in parts but overall a good movie with a somewhat shaky plot line!  Lots of laugh out loud moments.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|Best Superman to date.  Well unless you are considering works of writing but I am simply referring to TV / Movie adaptations.<br /><br />Reasons?<br /><br />1) Plenty of Action (Purposeful action as well).<br /><br />2) Plenty of back-story (Just the right amount to give you an investment to the characters and an understanding if you have never heard of them.  Sometimes to much back-story can really start to drag and I believe the movie found a great balance).<br /><br />3) Great use of timeline.  (The way Zach presents the movie is perfect.  He keeps the main plot of the movie moving along while interweaving the back-story along the way so one end of the movie is not dragging and other is only filled with action).<br /><br />Anyone who rated this movie 1 star should remove themselves from the gene pool.  Sure the movie isn't a monumental accomplishment that will go down for eons to come.  Or maybe your expectations were extremely ridiculous (what a shocker in this day and age).  But the movie was damn well worth the money and then some.<br /><br />If you are looking to take a chance on this movie you will NOT be disappointed.<br /><br />P.S.  This review is coming from someone who watches a LOT of movies / TV, and I do mean a lot.  This movie is a gem among a great deal of crap that tends to come out.

B00FOQRNPA|5.0|Upon finishing a book, there are few that I turn to the front cover and start reading again. This book is one of them. It provides readers lacking in medical training, a basic understanding of blood chemistry that leads to inflammation of the brain (and other organs) and gives a basic understanding of how we can make sensible steps to lengthen the aging process.<br /><br />We may not all face the prospect of Diabetes or obesity... but we do all face the challenge of maintaining our mental capabilities into old age. This book is for everyone... particularly those people already suffering ailments that are attributed to chronic inflammation... whether it be in the gut, the cardiovascular system, the joints, the skin... and most importantly, the brain. Even if you are unaware of any symptoms of inflammation, you should still read this book... the brain has a stoic nature and suffers in silence.<br /><br />The detailed diet suggested in the book provides a ready roadmap that shows how you can eat sensibly without denying yourself flavour, volume or variety.<br /><br />My only quandary about the book is whether I should read it a third time.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Love this movie. I'd seen it several times before but wanted to get my own DVD to watch. Definitely worth having
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this is a GREAT game if you like hunting. This is so fun. you can choose from multiple guns and my favorite is the shotgun! this game has great graphics and loading times aren't that long. you do have to wait for energy to reload, but that doesnt really take away. from the fact that this is an awesome app!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I'm so addicted to this game. Enjoy the challenge. You will definitely get addicted. So many of my friends are.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|Reminiscent of &#34;Little House on the Prairie&#34;.  Lots of my favorite actors, two from &#34;Vicar of Dibley&#34; and two from &#34;Starlings, including my favorite, the oh so handsome Brendan Coyle.
B003XE1DG0|5.0|These get a five star for the comfort. I could walk all day in these. Even though I expected them to be a little longer..I still give them a five star rating. I have bunions and these are the only shoes I can wear right now. I am sure they will stretch more with wear and feel like an old slipper. Thanks to crocs for amazing shoes!:)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so much fun. I constantly try to beat the amount of moves provided.  King has done it again with their games.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Doesn't work outside of the US the way you can operate other US-only streaming devices (roku or apple tv). But for the price it's good enough for the YouTube only airplay-like functionality.
B004G600A4|5.0|Movie arrived in &#34;New&#34; condition and played very well.  It's a good story, and the &#34;star&#34; was &#34;Maximus&#34;, the horse- quite hilarious!
B00D555BBU|4.0|Very happy w/ K-@ Mail Pro!  Fairly easy to maneuver & retrieve mail & establish mailboxes. The Email that came w/ my Kindle Fire HD was not functioning reliably. This has really helped me keep up w/ Email. Worth the reasonable price!
0385349947|4.0|I'm not even reading other reviewer's posts, as to not taint my own review! I DID enjoy this book. Don't have any criticism for Sheryl... found the book to up encouraging and forthright. I didn't give it five stars simply because it did not rock my world or catalyze any sort of transformation within me. It wasn't a 'life-changer'. But, it was good enough that I'm buying it for my mum for Christmas. :)
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Limited content in Australia , but overall a reasonable device for streaming to TV from mobile device.<br />Easy to set up on PC too.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The most recent update is crap. I was using the app (which was already stupid and didn't update the news feed properly) and then I updated it. Now it won't open at all. Why?
B00B6QXN56|3.0|Joe just going through the motions, he needs to dump Shirley the producer and get some new tunes rather than the same old stale set of tunes he's been pushing live for the last couple years, good talent wasted...
B009LMTDL0|3.0|While the book encourage working women to go after what they want at work and at home, Sheryl also expresses that each person must decide what is best for his/her life.  Ultimately leaning in can be done for those who choose to work outside or inside the home.  Readers should be aware that the path to getting what you want may be easier to some than others due to factors such as looks, personality,your ability to network, and your family connections.  The book is easy to read.  It is not different from the Tedtalk that she did.  I would recommend it to those who need a pep talk in keeping up at work.  Don't look to it as a way to boost your career.
B00ED2EMJQ|5.0|classic reissue of a great CD, if you want to know what Ten Years After sounded like live buy this cd, just great music...
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|it wont update and I cant listen to music while I play or it will glitch out and I will have to shut down my kindle
0783225547|4.0|This is a fun disaster flick with everything that you would expect and more!  This had a big budget, and it shows.  Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton really are good actors.  Their performances, a good script and lots of money to do the most realistically possible volcano eruption make this one of the better disaster films ever.  Rachel (Hamilton) and Harry (Brosnan) are trying to save Rachel's two children, as well as themselves, when the volcano starts to erupt.  They get in a boat, and the acid in the lake begins to melt the metal.  They get in a car and bridges are shaken loose.  They try to escape in an SUV, and their tires begin to melt from the heat of the lava.  Everything that can happen to these people happens...and it's so fun to watch!  All the while everything is being covered in molten ash that looks like peacefully falling snow.  I highly recommend this film.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Haven't used many other 'readers' but haven't needed to -- this is all i have needed!! I wish the search function produce better/more results, but other than that, love it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I think this is a great game one problem they go off the whole energy thing  overall it is a great game overall
B00DU74U74|3.0|Not as good as the book. We were disappointed. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
0345803507|5.0|Such a great trilogy!!  A great escape and a chance to imagine what it would be like to be taken care of and not have to think and make decisions for a brief moment.
B00EC7GRS6|4.0|Great companion but relatively high price for a docking station. You definitely need 1 at minimum for your overnight charge. I wish to go for a second one for office hrs but high price is holding me back.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|was too simple and not enough options, I would have liked it to have different choices, options, sounds, pics, etc.
B00B97SNJI|2.0|Someone produced all the life out of this album. The vocals are so up front that rest of the band can barely be heard.  The voices sound like a choir, which is nice but hardly rock and roll.  Many of the songs sound alike, the only difference being whether the lyrics are merely sad or positively morose.  This doesn't sound like the band that recorded Nothing is Wrong - I hope that band comes back without this producer.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|Such an awesome book. She describes her life so vividly it makes you feel like it's your life. I felt her emotions.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|I like Denzel Washingtonas an actor and I think he played the part well. The plot was believable though wish more would have been developed on his relationship with the red head former drug addict
B00DYEN5QU|3.0|Because Amazon likes to combine reviews for various forms of the movie ... this review is the Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray + DVD +UltraViolet Combo Pack ... with a picture of Henry Cavill's upper body torso ... standing upright ...<br /><br />This movie was ok, if you love the franchise, you'll be happy with it in most respects ... if you're a new comer / new fan boy / fan girl ... it might not be your speed ... and it could be better enjoyed as a rental or something of that nature ...<br /><br />However... What I'm REALLY startled by was the packaging!  There are 4 disks ... and only 2 disk holders... do the math... and you got it... that's 2 disks deliberately stacked on top of one another!  WHAT THE ????????<br /><br />Was this another way to squeeze more money out of us with even another way to make this &#34;minimal content&#34;??  Why couldn't they have spent an extra nickle and put in the proper 4 disk holder binder like everyone else does?<br /><br />UHG!!!!<br /><br />Anyway... enjoy the movie .. and be careful!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Helps me waste lots of time. Really it is addicting, but lots of fun! My 3 year old loves it too.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It would be a lot better if you didn't have to buy life's but it is a really fun game.
B008J8KBKY|4.0|It's fun game to kill time alone with being fun to play it also is a challenge game at times so it a Brian game to play begin 3D on top of it all over all fun game to play get it and see f your self
1594202273|1.0|Extremely informative on a period of our countries history that many have forgotten, I was in the AF in SAC in the seventies and eighties when some of what the author writes about occurred, it made me realize how lucky we are that an accident did not occur with nuclear weapons.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|This book, while over 700 pages,embraced the artistic expression in day-to-day life, as well as the renowned artistry, beautifully.  Theo's dramatic youth and raucous ride through adolescence both intrigue and saddened me.  It was written with a realism of the impact of grief on someone that was traumatized so young.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Great Movie! Extremely interesting, exciting and well-acted movie. I was not aware of just how much Wilberforce did to bring the end to slavery in England. Ioan Gruffudd's best performance of his career. A wonderful true story showing how Christian men & women worked to end slavery in England.
B00F9040HU|1.0|This game does not work, kicks me out all the time.  The game will also re-shuffle constantly when it is not needed.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|'The Husband's Secret'<br /><br />Very enjoyable, suspense, a real page turner.  After reading this book I wanted to read another book by Liane Moriarty. I read 'The Hypnotist's Story' and also enjoyed it.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Works Great every time. I got this to use on my Kindle Fire HD and for when I am shopping. Have had no problems with it. It's helped me stay in budget and to figure out cost per ounce on products. Very glad I got it. I use it at least once a week.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It makes you think three steps ahead of the one you are making. Beware, though, it may be habit forming.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I was having problems posting to Twitter from some of my other apps until I got the official Twitter App. I use it on my Kindle Fire HD. Now when I want to post something to Twitter from another App or game it gives me a pop up window with this Twitter app or the web as my choices as to how to post. So much easier now to share things on Twitter. Wish I had gotten it a long time ago.
B0036EH3WK|2.0|They did state it would not be in the best shape, but when I received the package it was crushed and crunched and the box set was just set in the package without any protection so I cannot tell what was already there for scratches and what was put there from shipping. I was less than impressed.
B001JP5JRY|5.0|Barney Stinson is the best and The Bro Code is a good read for some laughs!  I didn't put this down until I was finished... in the store before I bought it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love all the different boards and new ideas on all kinds of topics,cooking, crafts, lighthouses, photography, irish lace, vintage styles, Holidays, and maney more areas of interest.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love playing the game but hate when I'm given a &#34;time out&#34; unless I buy more lives.  The  game is very clever much like BeJeweled but with enough challenges to keep it from being boring
B000OW8DW6|5.0|This is of the most under-rated and under-watched movies I've encountered. The story is absolutely compelling and the actors bring out every character to a very convincing level. If you haven't seen this movie by now, make time for it. You won't regret doing so.
B00E8B1358|5.0|Great movie, lots of action . You wont be disappointed with this if you are a GI JOE fan. 5 Stars
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Funny story. Funny story. Kids enjoy following the antics of the kids in the book, Funny story funny story for kids to read.
B00170F0WU|5.0|Great film.  Jean Reno does as amazing job portraying a killer who finds redemption by rescuing a confused and lost little girl. In a world where everyone finds excuses for being pathetic or crushed by their circumstances Natalie Portman does a phenomenal job of portraing the resilience of the human spirit by surviving within an abusive home, overcoming the murders of her family and finding the will to survive in a very unconventional situation. Gary Oldman plays the ultimate bad guy in this film; a junky with a little bit of power.  Highly recommend watching this film. One of the things I have always loved about older European films their ability to portray gripping deadly scenes without the gore and Luc Besson does a really spectacular job with this.
B00024I2Z4|3.0|Only works on computer players due to zone.doesn't specify zone.Wont work on ps3 or dvd blue ray players bought in Chile
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|love the series but a little tired of Gideon and Eva's constant up and down.  I really wish this would have been the final installment.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|it jumps of quite frequently. and I'm only 5 feet away from the device. Luckily i don't use it very often, probably about 5 times out of the week.
0767802470|5.0|This is one of the few well known films that merits an extended cut. Oftentimes, a classic is reissued in \\"Director's Cut\\" form and it becomes evident why scenes were eliminated in the first place (Apocalypse Now Redux comes to mind).  The added material in Das Boot amplifies the claustrophobia and ennui, esssential to a submarine drama.  Since this is primarily a character driven piece, the additional time spent with them is a bonus.<br />The originally shot German/UK tv mini-series 5 hr. version called Original Uncut is also available. Haven't seen that one but this 208 min. version is stellar. I see that both extended versions are available for roughly the same price on Amazon....one reviewer recommends this version if watching for the first time and that is probably sound advice.
B00EI4V3X2|4.0|The on downfall I discovered is the bluetooth only supports mono chat, but not streaming of music. You have the cord needed though to plug it right into an iphone to listen to music if you wish. The stereo sounds good from pc. You will need a male to male 3.5 mm cable though. They do not provide that, and make that clear on the website. That is why they do not say it is not compatible with pc. You also will need bluetooth on your pc or a 2.5mm headset to pc adapter if you want to use it to chat on pc. It should be a good pc for Playstation 4 though. I'll update this review if I come across any issues. So far, I am very pleased. 4 out of 5 because I thought they could have made the bluetooth A2DP compatible and did not make that very clear that it wasn't.
0062127241|3.0|Always been a fan of Pete Townshend and I read this tome cover to cover but must admit I grew weary of his whining throughout the book about his need for more money for toys; boats, properties, guitars, et al.<br />It's a fairly depressing book, really. Judging from his accounts of decade after decade of unhappiness, Townshend is a fairly depressed guy when all is said and done.  Hell of a song writer and musical director but his insatiable need for something that eludes him finally grates on ones nerves when said often enough.  I suppose it springs from the same the artistic temperament that gave us all those iconic songs so I shouldn't complain, really. Townshend's art is music, not book writing after all.<br />Read it if you are a fan but in my estimation a better account of The Who's story is Dave Marsh's \\"Before I Get Old\\".
B0089LOG02|4.0|I thought the author did a masterful job of intertwining modern day with the past. A simple theme of old woman, Vivian, connects with a troubled youth, Molly, through recounting her difficult past. After reading the first 30 pages, I actually thought the book would end up being a little on the boring side and potentially ordinary, I was wrong. I am quite good at figuring out secrets and plots well before they are divulged, but I was surprised countless times throughout this novel. The author's research regarding Orphan trains was thorough and fascinating. The book is quite thought provoking in many ways.
B0025KVLVA|5.0|Though the 33 cuts herein were not intended to go on an album when originally recorded, one could makes a case that this is the best Beatles \\"album\\"...  It's a compilation of all the singles/ B sides and extra cuts not released on official albums and the highlights in it are many. The original two volumes are now combined into one and it tracks the band's best work from Love Me Do to Let It Be.  Count Day Tripper, Paperback Writer, I Feel Fine, Lady Madonna, Inner Light among favorites...it's like a greatest hits with extras, the extras being the likes of the German versions of She Loves You and I Wanna... Not to mention it's the only place where you'll find You Know My Name...<br />The practice of the day was not to include singles on the albums so many of the songs you know by heart were never included on their most well known lps.  Since 45s are no longer in currency, this is the best way to purchase them.<br />Beatles Past Masters is a Beatles masterpiece.
1250038820|5.0|I have been following HONY for several months now and this book was everything I expected it to be.  Nicely put together and great quality.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I LOVED this book from Grisham. Next to A Time to Kill, one of his best. Yes, full of racists, greedy relatives and dishonest lawyers - reality bites. And nobody can depict the reality of the deep south quite like Grisham. My only picky criticism was I knew how it was going to end (down to who, what and where) long before the ending. Perhaps too much foreshadowing? As far as the legal shenanigans, it took me back to all my years working in large law firms. That is exactly how they work.
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|I kind of expected more from this album.  It feels like it was just a money grab, only a few of the songs really jump out at me the rest just don't seem like Jimi would have wanted them released.
B004GYY714|5.0|I used to listen to the radio-alarm to listen in the morning but with this app. it's much better and sometimes I listen other stations in different languages. I get to practice my Portuguese and Italian languages. Sometimes my native Spanish. It's so clear and does not cut.  I really love this app!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book had me glued in an instant! I had been told about it ages ago but like Jimmy Fallon, I was late to the party on this one. I guarantee when reading this book you will begin to question what you would do in such a situation. Great read for anyone.
B002RXVOX0|5.0|An absolutely romantic classic. The eroticism is not in the sex scene as much as the atmospheric scenes. Women who know the most evocative scene say, &#34;that's the one!&#34; Bela Lugosi may have created the characturization of Count Dracula but Frank Langella has us all wishing to be Kate Nelligan. Great timeless flick
B008XG1X18|1.0|I love Pinterest but I'm not a fan of this app for my Kindle Fire. It constantly crashes and doesn't work as it should. It's not very self explanatory either, it took me forever to find my own boards.
0316204366|5.0|This book was another masterpiece from Gladwell. if you like other books from Gladwell, (outliers, tipping point) then you'll like this one just as well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. It's fun and aggravating at the same time. I play it every chance I get.  Like to also see my friends progress.
1594744769|5.0|This book is peculiar and enchanting. When I finished it, I was sad that I'd never be able to read it again for the first time. I've since re-read it several times, but there was something special about the first read and I feel like I would be doing a disservice to future readers to discuss it more. If you're reading this, you've probably read quite a bit about the book already, but if this is the first review you see, do yourself a favor: don't read any more. This is not a story that can be enjoyed on the kindle, so order yourself a real copy and enjoy.
6305428352|5.0|Simply because it reached the core of my being and rang true.  One man's life under the microscope for all to see.  Beautiful.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|love these games that stimulate my mind. Hope more rooms come out soon. Ready for some more stimulation. Don't. want to wait too long.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|All three books in the series are a good, fun read for all adults!!!!!! Surprisingly it turns into a can't put it down series.<br /><br />KC
B001EBWIUO|5.0|Great movie with an interesting twist at the end. A friend had recommended it and said it was really good, but neither my wife or I had ever heard of it before. I never thought of Humphrey Bogart as this kind of character but he played it very well.<br /><br />Well worth watching.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book describes me almost perfectly. I see the world in a different way now. And I hope to find and Augustus waters somewhere in this world.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Brilliantly written. Best Sci-Fiction novel read to date! Couldn't stop reading it. Told all my friends it's a Must Read.
159514188X|3.0|This is a copy/paste from my Goodreads review. Please see my other snarky reviews.<br />The writing is good. This book grabs you and won't let you go. I don't read a lot of suspense genre but I liked this one. The idea of \\"suicide tapes from the dead\\" was brilliant.<br /> Now, the critique. As a writer, I can sympathize with the author for dropping the ball on the ending. A good ending is tough because it has to be believable and feel natural. This one didn't. We now live in a world where teen suicide is becoming normalized. The main reason for teen suicide is gay and lesbian bullying, at least that's what popular media would have us believe. If Hannah did struggle with same sex feelings, then Courtney Crimson definitely belongs on her list as does Jessica Davis and Jenny Kurtz. Since there was no \\"alpha male\\" for these girls to compete over, they turned their claws on poor Hannah. Believe me, as a victim of bullying, girls only have one reason to bully another girl and it always includes getting the attention of a guy and/or moving up the female social ladder.<br /> With the exception of Mr. Porter, EVERY SINGLE BOY on Hannah's list just wanted to get in her pants. Yep, even Clay, the perfect boyfriend who got away. Poor Clay. He was the only one who wasn't looking to hook up with Hannah. He never even realized he wanted to be in a serious dating relationship with a girl until he saw Skye. Now, if Clay had taken Hannah out on a few dates but then dumped her for Skye, THAT would've been a great reason for Hannah to take her own life. Jay Asher just doesn't understand \\"girl world\\" and he should've made his suicide victim a boy.<br /> Therefore, the REAL title of this book should've been Thirteen Reasons Why Girls Shouldn't Initiate Sex. Hannah, dear, I'm sorry but you brought this on yourself. I don't know what drove you to seek constant male validation or why your parents were such idiots that you never confided in them as to what was driving you to hook up with every guy in your class but life really does get better after high school.
B0058S0OMS|3.0|a good double feature of 2 movies i like (this and terror in the aisles on one disk)though i wish there was more extras
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|I find it is not as funny as previous ones and a little tiring.It has hilarious moments but in general it is rather bland.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|McEwan's use of exactly the right word to convey an idea or image is amazing.  The ending was especially interesting and unexpected.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love love this book! The whole series is amazing! Second time reading the whole series in time for the new movie coming out. Could read it 100xs :)
B007SGM084|4.0|I have read the books, now I am 're-reading the series, before the movie comes out. I enjoyed the re-read, even if it's a little over the top for me...
1250038820|5.0|Absolutely amazing. Humans of New York went way, way beyond my expectations. It's not just the Facebook or Tumblr page in the form of a book. It's way more than that. It brought tears to my eyes, and I felt connected to every single one human being in those pages.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I thought I didn't need friends help when I started playing. Very disappointed when I hit the level I needed tickets. That's why I don't play games that I need friends help cause I don't have very good friends. Took me 3-4 days to collect 3 tickets..
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|Have read many of Bill's books and have enjoyed each one. I am enjoying the stories of all of the things that happened in 1927. Would recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of challenges, and strategies. It's totally silly but fun! Addictive! Love that there are a lot of levels. I love it!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I could not jump over the huge train for the life of me.... fun while I kept it.  Have since deleted the game, however, you have so many more to try/experience.
B002N44XSG|5.0|Best book I have ever read tells an extremly amazing story that keeps you on the edje of yoy seat the whole way.
B00BP4X3W2|4.0|Love Steven Spielberg he bring all of his films to life! His movies are very inspiring and the actors in this movie were very believable
B007QA3AH2|5.0|A very nice movie which is a sort of a spoof of the Star Trek plot, characters, and dynamics between Lead Actor and supporting cast members.<br /><br />&#34;By Grabthar's Hammer, by the sons of Warvan, you shall be avenged.&#34;
B007IXWKUK|5.0|this book is a great read. it has great flow and an amazing continuation of book number one. i definatley recomend it
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|One of the best games for mobile. Graphics are some of the greatest I have seen for an app. I highly recommend it.
B008Q0AP2E|4.0|Kirsten Duntz was wonderful as the child vampire and Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise also had very good performances. A very enjoyable movie all around and a relatively faithful adaptation of the book.
B009V0TV6O|1.0|I guess it just not for me.someone else might enjoy it i felt it didn't do a thing but annoy me.
B00FEHXISA|2.0|Well, almost. There are other movies I've rented/watched that were worse, but, this one really sucks. It's soooooo predictable. If all you're interested in is a movie with very predictable &#34;action&#34; (and that's a stretch) then go for it. It's intended for ADHD teenagers IMNO, otherwise a waste of time and money. I did like the first one very much, the second one was fairly good, but, as Hollywood usually does, they stunk this one up to the high heavens!!
B00008G8LG|5.0|This is an older movie but one of my favorites.  It is a story of an English teacher and her son who travel from India (a British Colony) to Thailand.  Her job is to teach the King's children.  She stands out immensely there where women are subservient, because of her  many opinions and very principled strength of character.  Many think she sees herself equal to a King.<br /><br />You are introduced to Thailand's sites and culture, as well as swept up by the emotion of relationships developed and various problems arising throughout the story.  I cannot see how anyone would not love this movie, as it really touches your heart.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I just love this music.  I listen to it all the time.  I simply love all the tracks on it.  They are so hauntingly beautiful!  So soothing and energetic at the same time.  Also so romantic.  Every time I listen to it I feel like I've been transported to a very happy and fairytale like place.  I love violin music and my brother told me if I'd heard of Lindsey Stirling.  I hadn't so I quickly looked her up on amazon, liked what I heard and bought it.  So glad I did.
0783225733|5.0|Apollo 13 is an old standard to keep in your movie collection.  Casting is very good.  Story is funny, interesting, adventurous and heartwarming.  I guarantee you will like it.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Brilliant, captivating, excellently produced. Best flight crash scene ever. Denzel is a powerful actor. Gripping from the very beginning of the fulm
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I can't say enough about this movie series.  The casting is wonderful.  The acting is superb.  This movie gives you an insight into the lives of the founding fathers and the immense sacrifices that they had to make to break off from Britain's power and form a new nation.  It is not a documentary, it is a true to life story that follows the lives of the first three presidents and their personal lives.  There is much hardship, years spent away from families, disloyalty, unpopularity in their life's work.  Even so, they had a firm resolve to do what they felt was right.<br /><br />It is not at all like the movie Lincoln which I didn't enjoy at all.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Great Series!  Makes you think... Drama with a little comedy sprinkled in... Excellent packaging and in new condition like stated.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Best keyboard By far. Better than google key board and swype and others. I've tried them all. Wait for deals tho. They are always coming up.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I love it Breaking Bad. Absolutely hooked on it!  Packaging was excellent and in new condition like stated. Thank you!
B008KNUKVI|4.0|The first reason to hear PTX is to be amazed at the noises that these guys can make with just their mouths!  Beyond that, however, these songs are fun to listen to and catchy.  This is a group of very talented singers.
1452110581|5.0|I Could Pee on This  It is a book with short poems written by cats. It was fun to read.
B002KS1IJC|1.0|I stayed late last night to watch it on sci fy but in the middle of the movie I was thinking to quit it or not. Unfortunately, I stayed till the end. Some things where bad, while others where plain mediocre.<br />  Cavil is one of my favorites for two reasons 1. Monte Christo and 2. Jesus. Well, here its like he doesn't exist, but I can't blame him. His character is cold, doesn't talk that much so you cannot relate nor sympathize with him.<br />  From that point on I think that the story as a story is not that bad but the problem is in the script. uninteresting dialogues, boring characters and sometimes stupid scenes which make no sense.<br />  Effects are acceptable and so is the direction in a mediocre atmosphere which sometimes is good, sometimes feels weird like out of place.<br />  Some people might like it(hardcore fantasy-sci-fi fans) but I think its one of the worst movies I saw this year together with this is the end which for some reason everybody praised!<br />  For the first 30 minutes the movie is ok but from that point on its gets worse...
B00E193TM2|3.0|It is just OK. Previous music was better. Many of their songs are starting to sound the same. Still a good album.
B00FPH3YQA|2.0|The movie lagged from start to finish, and most certainly did not meet the comedic standards of parts 1 and 2.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|A great Denzel Washington character: a deeply flawed character but with a moral compass that leads him to the path of righteousness.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is one of the best games I have played. I Can't wait for the next chapter to come out.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|This one of the best browsers. I have used it for years and have always liked it.<br />It offers different web viewing  experience.
0679805273|5.0|Simply put-this Dr. Seuss book is an absolute treasure.  There's another book that's similar to this one-it's the In Utero version of Oh, the Places You'll Go!  Read this to your child at any time! Fun story.
1609611543|5.0|This book has been so helpful for me. Now I understand why I have been having so many gastric problems. Since cutting wheat out of my diet a month ago I feel so much better. My digestive system is almost back to normal and I feel lighter(which is hard to describe properly) and I have stopped taking Gas-X and antacids and feeling bloated and cramped. I would highly recommend this book.
B009KCUX3S|5.0|Definitively the best programming book I ever read. It is concise, clear and very pleasant to read. Authors use a unique pedagogical style changing the way you learn a programming language.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|I have both the 1947 version and this newer version.  They are our traditional kick-off to the Christmas season.  We watch them after enjoying the Macy's Parade on Thanksgiving Day.  Although I am truly an &#34;old movie&#34; buff I am glad to have both in my Holiday DVD collection.
B00479SVBU|4.0|I am very happy with the sound quality, reliability, and the price. It is a little awkward to use for podcasts because you have to clear and reset the bookmark function before shutting the car off--this is what makes it resume at that point in the podcast when you start it up again. Another frustration is that it relies on the the power source turning off and back on again to restart the device after you turn it off. On my vehicles the cigarette lighter is energized all the time. This means I have to unplug it every time I shut the car off and plug it in again when I start up. It would be good if the manufacturer had included a power switch or some other means to turn the device back on again.
B0058W74UY|4.0|This works great when you need to download for flash browser. Silk is for Kindle Fire, but this works with Dolphin Browser.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is actually pretty good app. Keeps me on my toes and my kids like the game too! We play together or separate and its great!
B001AGXEAG|5.0|Excellent Movie, This Movie is a Classic I recommended to everybody, new part is coming soon somebody told me. Waiting
B00881VLCE|3.0|I like the puzzles, but the app fails often and I have to shut it down and start over.  I will continue to use it, but will probably look for a better one.
B004JHYRP4|3.0|Good very good Asimov typical the best.  Science fiction all the way will. Read more once I take a. Break
B00B2OSZIW|5.0|Adds much needed grip and works on the xe1 and new xe2.  This is a must have accessory. Does block the battery tray and SD card, but with USB connection and wifi no need to open the battery and SD tray unless replacing the Battery.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|I love the feel of the controller. Its very comfortable to hold like the xbox 360 and has the added bonus of grip that keep my hands from going numb, but sometimes the buttons have a split second lag which can really kill a gaming experience in instances where timing is crucial.  If you play games that don't have quick-time playing this would be prefect!
B007JGAR6U|3.0|Its is a good looking flash unit. It is made of solid metal. However it does have a slow recycle time and makes a high piched noise when charging. This does not have wireless TTL slave mode just manuel. By no means a competitor to pro flashes. Just buy off brand.
B00G32OER4|2.0|This movie is the usual possession type movie, with some good special effects, but not enough of them to set it apart from dozens of others, of this type.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|Eggers did an amazing job of delving into the current and future advances in technology.  Given that private and public drones are now legal, his concepts are not that remote.  He addresses the ethical dilemmas inherent in these innovations in a way that is not heavy-handed, yet he clearly makes his point.  I enjoyed it much more than A Hologram for the King.<br /><br />It was impossible to put it down and I probably read it in about four days!
B008Y5T5ZE|4.0|The ending needs work to give it clarity<br />Too much left to the viewers own imagination.<br />Johnny Depp is fantastic!!!
B002QH2NUA|5.0|Mr. Paul McCartney is and shall always be one of the best musicians and entertainers in the world. Wonderful show.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting patiently for this game to appear. And finally ....we have it. This is the best game ever.
B000XXTCF8|5.0|As a longtime fan of his music, this is fine by me. Can't really go wrong with Van the Man.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|I liked Forest Gump because it portrayed what I think is a truism, that &#34;stupid is as stupid does&#34;.  Forest is developmentally delayed but is taught correct principles by his mother and lives a moral and simple life which leads him to fame and fortune by displaying simple qualities like, honesty, dependability, humility, obedience, tenacity, hard work and loyalty.  While all of the &#34;smart&#34; people around him are doing drugs, having uncommitted relationships, etc. which leads them to despair and ruin.  I did not like the vulgar portrayal of his mother's desperation in getting him into public school.  I thought that was done in a cheap and vulgar way.  But other than that I though it was a good movie.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Pretty good game.  Lots of levels.  Good for passing time even the kids seem to enjoy playing.  Would like crystal to be more available
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|My son talk me into watching this movie it was good and the acting was good, you really have to watch and pay attention to understand it, which I find hard to do at times, still not sure if I understand the movie.
B00633W614|5.0|Archer is one of my favorite writers.<br />He never seems to fail to keep his readers interested in the story.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I gave this 5 stars just because the concept of the movie was believable, it is entertaining to watch also.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|Love this DVD - I have it on VHS, but it was getting old.  Happy to see the story again.
B002VWNID6|5.0|Bought this DVD to replace my mom's VHS copy. It is a favorite movie of hrs and she is very pleased to have it on DVD.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This was an Excellent D V D - inspirational songs to anyone. I bought it for my Mom and she loves the music.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|Bought this DVD to replace my mom's VHS copy. It is a favorite movie of hrs and she is very pleased to have it on DVD.
B0007M22TI|5.0|This was an Excellent sound track - inspirational songs to anyone. I bought it for my Mom and she loves the music
B004SKIPXW|5.0|This was a item I wanted to watch.  It is a great item and has been read quite a bit. A plus
0345529057|5.0|Great books with a good story.  I haven't even watched shows yet, but I think I like the books better.
B00475BUVM|5.0|This was a item needed.  My wife has enjoyed it quite a bit since she has got it. A plus
630522577X|5.0|Loved this story when I was young.  Brought it for my mom who doesn't like what's on tv.  She loves the music
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|'13' is an amazing surprise for not just Sabbath fans or Metalheads like me, it was a surprise (and wake up call) for the Music Industry. Hitting #1 on the charts and proving,  once and for all, that Heavy Metal always returns from the dead. Ozzy, Tony, and Geezer are back(Bill backed out, but I'm sure he regrets that now) and this new stuff is HEAVY! A throwback to their early sound and pulse-pounding lyrics of doom. Yes, Rick Rubin gets cred here for leading the band who created metal music in the first place. Sure, Rick likes to work in his pj's, and what a master producer he is. Pick this one up now even if you were never into Sabbath. I guarantee you will dig it. No other rock band comes close to a true blue 'comeback' album. \\"13\\" is awesome. I bought the Deluxe version so I could get the bonus trax.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|This was an Excellent sound track - inspirational songs to anyone. I bought it for my Mom and she loves the music
B0063GORYU|5.0|I just love this game.  The challenge for me is against the clock.  How fast can I complete the game and how does that compare to others who have played it.  Could play it all day if I didn't have work to do!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was by far the longest discussion our book club has ever had after reading this book.  There are so many viewpoints and ideas about why she did that..or what actually happened to him....  It's just a great book, with heart wrenching accounts and very brief moments of joy.  Great book club book.
0743270754|5.0|One of the best books ever!  If you want an insight into the life and time of Lincoln, this is the book.  It includes amazing details of his life and of society during those years.  It gives you a look at politics back then and how it is the same and yet very different from today.  The profiles of the other great politicians that we rarely hear about is amazing.  The book is full of facts yet presented in a way that keeps you interested to the end.  I love this book!
B00G32OER4|5.0|Very good movie enjoyed watching this with friends I love Lorren warren and it was scary but interesting I would recommend
B00DP8XSQ2|2.0|I found it very hard to read the the information to pinpoint the star regions at which to look.  Google Night was a better app.
B005FISBTO|5.0|This has to be the most gruesome to me!..the story line is dark, more twisted than the Trinity killer or the Ice truck killer.. if that can be..does still have my interest, wondering what is next..!
B003GFIWGK|5.0|I am a big fan of Sherlock Holmes and it was great to be able to read ALL of the books.  At some point in time, I will probably re-read them again.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Still loving this show..rivals the likes of BrBa, Deadwood, and other great series..I understand now its over..but I'm still catching up!
B00B3EJ292|1.0|hate sub titles, dumb movie how could this win an Oscar, Hollywood has their priorities wrong in selecting movies and it is sure not what the public thinks is number one movie
B0058YPG1G|5.0|What can I say about what I think is probably the best television series in the history of television!!.. Was sad to see it end..but it ended so well...
B008JFUPFI|5.0|A dark Superman film in which the Man of Steel remains a beacon of hope, and role model for everyone. This version's General Zod is perhaps one of the best movie villains of all time.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Very addicting series..have bought all seasons except the last, which I hear is disappointing..but so far..season 2 is just as great as season one..
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|Fantastic movie, never saw the ending coming. completely rewatchable with the twist. If you like the Illusion and the Prestige try this
B008JFUORW|4.0|It was a cute movie..maybe not has hilarious as the first one..but was worth watching..I do however, hope this is the last one! LOL
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It works great except for viewing Amazon Instant Videos.  These would not transfer to my TV.  All the other movie rentals worked fine.
B007OLYQ4E|4.0|It's a classic for a reason. I loved the three additional stories at the end.  This was a great purchase.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Game is awesome, it has great graphics. The competitions are great Great multiplayer features. Limited energy kind of sucks. I like the different breeds of horses and how you can buy them.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|After telling my daughter bedtime stories about Snow White, I decided to buy the movie for her. She is almost 3 and this is her first Disney Princess movie. She really could care less for Snow White and loves the dwarfs. Its pretty short and not complicated to grasp. The witch is kinda scary but not overly freaky. Overall its a good movie for little ones.
0694003611|5.0|Very awesome book.  Even after reading it 3 thousand times, we can still find more things in the room to name or count.  (my fav is the tiny mouse)  My son loves this thing!
B00GMONG90|5.0|I have been waiting for this album to be released since they announced a tentative release date!!  I have seen Pentatonix in concert twice in St. Louis, MO and I also own PTX Vol. I and PTXmas.  This group is exceptionally talented and SO humble.  They just LOVE what they do best...making great arrangements of covers and writing beautiful original songs.  I can't wait to see them in concert again in Springfield, MO and St. Louis, MO in 2014!!!  If you get the chance, PLEASE go see them in concert.  It is an experience that should not be missed.  #pentaholic
0671449028|5.0|This is my favorite bed time book and is my 1.5 year old son's too (well, that and Goodnight Moon).
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I love this book.  Great lesson for kids and adults.  Thoughtfully and simply written.  I highly recommend this book for everyone
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|this is the best book series I have ever read amazing story amazing characters  and a bittersweet ending<br /><br />highly recommended
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I love this game its so fun XD I play it so much its so addictive. I have to get the blue bot.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved the movie. Loved the book. High School is a challenging time where people are trying to find out who they are and where they fit in and this book definitely delves into that.
B002MUAJ2A|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It was inspiring, concise and funny. The business slant is obviously towards software development but the authors also use other good examples and analogies.<br /><br />Overall I appreciate the irreverent tone and disdain towards the business as usual model the most. It was a refreshing perspective I find lacking from many of the current \\"meetings\\" I endure.
1582701709|5.0|ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!!! This book is powerful and intensely positive. I gave this for a gift but need to purchase one for myself!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|its fun and passes the time quickly. it can be addicting if not careful.. Candy Crush Saga is one of the good games that has many levels and different stages that keep you interested.
1419701533|5.0|Oldest son cant put them down.  My son has been a lover of this series for years and just yesterday was very excited to get the latest one in the mail.  He reads every one of these books at least once a month.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I downloaded this software for my Android Tablet and have used it several times to edit a document. Seeing that it's a FREE download, how much better can that get?
B004SIIBGU|4.0|i dont like the fact that i cant view all the pictures when i open something with multiple photos please fix it!!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|If you want to use only Netflix this might be just what you need. If for example, you want to stream your own content, that is a different story. If you have movies on your device, you aren't going to be able to stream them to anything else. The same applies if you watch Amazon's Prime Video streaming.<br /><br />There are all kinds of comments about work-arounds, experiments and so on but is that really what you want to do? If so, try it but if you think you can just take this along in your pocket, plug into some TV somewhere and stream a movie, that isn't going to happen unless you are also paying money for some other services.<br /><br />If you have a lot of movies you already own, Chromecast isn't going to let you stream them to a TV. Again, you can try the work-arounds but really, isn't that a lot of trouble when other products can do what you want out of the box?
B001HN6EF4|5.0|Very fun to be waterproof!  Easy transport with the caribeener and even if not on water, nice to be able to wipe clean. Great!
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|We loved this movie.  I'm not usually fond of 2nd movies, but thought this one was very well done.  Might buy it for Christmas!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|The reader has no idea what lies ahead when first introduced to the protagonist and his family. More and more questions arise as the reader is brought further and further along on a journey which involves the odd happenings in a strange town  and the weird encounters with its' residents.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A plus amazing and the conclusion was spot on . Looking forward to more from JG. Great Job and more
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I am a huge SC fan and this is a nice collection to own. I do think the dvd cases could have been made better for the amount this package costs.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|THe sequel to a Time to Kill did not disappoint.  The story was one that kept me reading late in to the night as the plight of a simple housekeeper became the talk of the small town of Clanton, Mississippi.  The return of Jake Brigance and his small law practice was welcome and the story an intriguing one with many interesting social issues intertwined with the legal issues involved.  The sordid history of racism in the early south was woven in to the plot and the ending was one which caused the reader to reflect on where we were and where we are today with this volatile issue.  The title was an intriguing one and it wasn't until the end that the significance of the title became apparent.  A book worthy of the time it took to read it.  And it sparked a hope that there would be sequels to follow involving the same characters.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|It is a little hard to figure out, so I think if it improved in user friendly-ness I would have liked it more. Once you do figure it out it is adequate. It works and that is really all you need in an alarm clock.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|After a long break from reading John Grisham novels, I finally decided to read one of the newer ones.  While this novel was a relatively quick and easy read, it was lacking the interesting nuances of the legal system that Grisham has been known for in the past.  This book is devoid of surprises and suspense and instead grinds on through a relatively boring plot line.  This is definitely a book where the movie would likely actually be better.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Really enjoyable read. Our book club included a hike to the PCT as our book club meeting. Great look at the emotional travel from very sad to finding peace.
0547391005|4.0|This is old school Curious George. Time (and PBS) has done a lot to make this monkey and the relationship with the Yellow hatted man a lot more cute and educational than it used to be. The book is beautiful and the stories are fun, but just know that you are getting George before his evolution (as it were).
B00AECGQF2|4.0|This is a fun game and I have found that my 6 year old niece absolutely loves it! I was lucky enough to scoop it up while it was offered as the free app of the day, and I'm very glad that I did.<br /><br />There is a wide range of hairstyles and hair colors to choose from, and the animation is excellent. It's great to be able to use your finger to buzz hair away or to swipe down and watch the hair &#34;grow&#34; right before your eyes. My niece really gets a kick out of using the hair dryer and watching the characters face flap with the power of the wind.<br /><br />The app works great on the Kindle Fire, and even though it is marketed mostly as a children's app, I have to admit I've had quite a bit of fun with it myself!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Need more rooms but other than that it is very challenging. Wag better than 100 floors is because you have a lot more to do
B000B5OD4I|5.0|Not a review, just informational post for those who care about origin of manufacture.<br /><br />For those who think they are getting a 100% Japanese-made watch: Seiko's cases are all made in China. Their movements are made in Malaysia or Singapore unless the watch face specifies 'Japan Mov't.'<br /><br />Seiko &#34;Made in Japan&#34; labeled watches are only assembled in Japan, but the cases are still made in China.<br /><br />Getting an all Japanese-made watch is almost an impossibility now days unless you buy vintage  or spend upwards of $1000 for new.<br /><br />All Seikos, Orients, Citizens, Casios, etc,. cases, bands etc. are made in China.<br /><br />It's an unfortunate reality that if you buy a lower-end Seiko, the only thing Japanese you're getting is the name.<br /><br />See my review for [[ASIN:B007BF61GO Orient Black Ray Automatic Dive Watch CEM65008B]]

B001UV4XIS|4.0|Great part II for the last installment of the Harry Potter series.  Though movies seldom capture the fullness of the book, the finale of the last Harry Potter captures the essence and plot of the book very well.  Visual effects are well done and in most cases are seamlessly blended with the live action  to the point it looks natural/real.

B00006RJSG|5.0|always a bonus to watch the frontman get down and dirty by dancing in the rain and making a mess of his costumes. it is a break away from the pristine, secluded, perfection geared world of western society. the set list includes songs of how sad people become in the secular world. he breaks the mold by throwing caution to the wind and inspiring everyone to let loose and just have some fun.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book. Chris did a great job in describing his life as a seal. As you read it you are reminded by how sad that all came to an end. It gives you a great picture into his mindset on how he survived and saved others. A true American HERO. His wife is just as much a hero for her contributions and sacrifices she made. Thank you for everything Chris, rest in peace.

B00EW9GQR6|5.0|When Lady Gaga said she would be Genre-Tripping, she meant it. This is an excellent, very well thought out album, which shows her as both an eclectic songwriter and musician. She demonstrates many sides to her persona, showing that she isn't just a Pop singer with one dimension. Definitely an album worth listening to.

B00ESY7QXI|3.0|I had not read the book or seen the earlier version, so this was all new to me. The images and cars and houses and parties were all very flamboyant.

B00005N9CV|5.0|Several of the songs on this CD make me stop what I'm doing just to listen to them. Wonderful voice, piano and music composition, stunning. Also, you will fall in love with your spouse all over again, guaranteed.
B00FQPHOPI|3.0|I guess I just demand too much from a movie. I was expecting top tier, but instead got the average quick buck grabbing Hollywood. What this offered in special effects, it lacked in writing and acting. It seemed that after the first 3rd of the script, the writers got tired, stoned or just plain complacent. It's a shame they couldn't bring it in to home plate. Plenty of hype that didn't quite match the finished product.

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|As I sit here in my 9,000 sq ft waterfront mansion with my exquisite Swedish girlfriend and our Burmese cat Ferrari, I was drawn to think how this book had helped me. I finally understood that The Law of Attraction only works in dollars, so those poor bastards starving to death in the Sudan can suck it up. And it doesn't work if you are a criminal, so anyone on death row had better stop wasting their (and The Universe's) time asking for help. Anyone being tortured in some God-forsaken hole for ideological differences is likewise shit-out-of-luck. And those kids dying of cancer, well, apparently they're just not asking in the right way. So that left me, victim of a consumer mentality and needing more and more material acquisitions every day, to fend for myself.<br /><br />My exotic house, exotic girlfriend, exotic car, exotic cat and, of course, exotic net worth are all in my head, but I believe they are arriving soon.
B003DES8I6|1.0|its not even the same genre as the first one, I was shocked to learn it was the same director. I watched it ignoring the warnings of others reviewers and I regret it. everything that was so great about the first one was abandoned for slapstick and horribly unpleasant characters.
0385537131|5.0|The first page of Mr. Grisham's books always seem to grab your attention and you really don't want to lay the book down even to go to sleep.  Even though the ending can be figured out, you will stay drawn to the story to see if you are correct in your assumption. This book has some interesting, colorful down-south characters that you swear you know and keep the story moving right along. I always look forward to a next book and have not been disappointed yet. This is about an elderly man who decides to right a wrong done many years ago. His decision certainly becomes an eye opener to his negligent children.
1451673442|5.0|I have read through 13 chapters, and everyday I indulge into this Magical book. It's like a workbook, which guides us through and literally pulls away from all the negativity around and within us. The feeling is divine and heavenly. The best thing I loved about this version was that we could translate and absorb teachings coming from different religions, school of thoughts. those little perks at the start of each chapter having quotes from writers, philosophers, etc are simply beautiful.<br />Morning burst with so much energy and positive thoughts through  The MAGIC is unimaginable!<br />I recommend this to readers who are lost in their blues and want to get out of their phase. This book helps and guides on every bit of your life. From relationships, to career, to your health. one can smartly work out every block of its life sequentially.<br />Most I love about it was making my dream list and thanking/expressing gratitude every moment. Now whenever I am driving to work, I keep thanking every small best thing coming across. Let the Magic Dust sprinkle on your lives!

B00AR1G3FS|2.0|I love the Eagles. The Hell Freezes Over DVD is probably the most played disc I own.. I was so excited to get this blu-ray for finally an HD Eagles Concert! And it looks amazing. It sounds amazing also with the new DTS-HD track. But one Huge Problem, Its totally out of Sync!I actually bought another copy from amazon thinking it might be a bad disc, but the same thing is happening (to a slightly lesser degree). It can be corrected on my AVR but why should we have to? I own over 100 Blu Rays and this is the only title I've have Sync Issues. And it happened twice. Its a shame because its a really great sounding concert. :((((

B009EHDU7U|5.0|This is honestly one of the best books I have read because of its almost autobiography of this 100 year old. Although fiction, the references to the encounters with world leaders and the consequences of such is amazingly believable! Obviously researched and put together well.
B00B0LPYXG|2.0|The only part of this movie that was a \\"nail-biting thriller\\" was the plane crash 20 minutes into the movie.  After that I just waited for something to happen but was completely disappointed when nothing ever did, except a lot of alcohol and drugs.  I really wanted to like this movie but I thought it was a waste of time.
B00BRUQ3PS|3.0|\\"Oryx and Crake\\" was a fantastically good dystopian novel: imaginative, fast moving, filled with clever wordplay, lots of surprises and fireworks. \\"The Year of the Flood,\\" a parallel story, was less compelling, but still engaging, with its different point of view on the same global catastrophe.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"Maddaddam\\" does not earn the same praise. After a minimal plot advance from YOTF, the book is mainly taken up with flashbacks to male protagonist Zeb's adventures before the \\"waterless flood,\\" some of which seriously fail the willing-suspension-of-disbelief test. This reader was continually asking himself where on earth Atwood was going with all this. The conversion of those adventures into a virtual Book of Genesis for the guileless, innocent Crakers was clever, entertaining, and sometimes hilarious. But none of the backstories really advanced the main plot, and their connection to the eventual outcome was pretty tangential.<br /><br />As to characters, Zeb is by turns hero and thug, a conflict that's never really reconciled. Female protagonist and main narrator Toby is not as strong a character in Maddaddam as in YOTF. For most of this book, Snowman (ironic, convincing narrator of  \\"Oryx and Crake\\" and unwilling creator of the Craker mythology) merely languishes, as does Amanda, a strong character in YOTF. But the youthful Craker Blackbeard is well imagined and well drawn, and indeed the plot's end game would have been impossible without him.<br /><br />All in all, mostly entertaining, with flashes of Atwood's brilliance. But no page-turner. The ending, a hopeful but only partial resolution, didn't provide any more closure than its predecessors did. Three stars.

B009CVRQLY|5.0|This is the first CD by Celine Dion I have ever purchased.<br />I have missed the depth and richness that a mature artist brings to each song; the kind of music that you know you will never grow tired of hearing.  A real artist does not have to remind you with each song how high a note they can reach nor yell instead of sing.<br />I enjoyed every song and highly recommend this CD.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|We heard Let It Go and became instant Passenger fans. I liked this album enough that although I already had the Let It Go single, I still bought the whole thing. He has an unmistakeable voice, and this album has enough consistency to feel like a compilation though there is enough variety on it that you don't get bored.

B008JFUO72|2.0|My rating is specific to this version of Iron Man 3, and does not reflect on the movie itself. I loved Iron Man 3 when I saw it in theaters and I was excited to buy it on DVD. I specifically chose this version because it had a digital copy. I neglected to pay attention to the special features listed, which is my fault, and there are very few included. The digital copy was more important to me, though, and I was very unhappy to open the package only to learn that the digital copy included is not compatible with my device. This is definitely not my fault - there is no indicator on the package or in the item description that says this digital copy is only a streaming copy. I have an iPod Classic, which requires a download via iTunes. Though many Disney films allow a download via iTunes, this particular film does not. All of the options listed are for streaming only (Amazon Instant Video, VuDu, and GooglePlay). I checked with the digital copy provider and they confirmed that there is not an option compatible with my device. This makes the digital copy worthless to me, as I'm not interested in a streaming copy. Since the DVD doesn't have any other redeeming features, I feel cheated for choosing this version of the DVD.

B000TXZVGQ|4.0|My So-Called Life, what can I say about this series...I watched it so many times I've lost count, I don't think any other show has come close to it and definitely I haven't found any other teen guys as good looking as the epic Jordan  Catalano with his dusty brown hair, romantic eyes, and that bone structure...oh his manly bone structure! (Ok I'll stop now).<br /><br />Oh yea Claire Danes was good too.

006202406X|2.0|I read Divergent and Insugent and fell in love with this series.  Tris is just an amazing character and once adding Tobias to the mix it was one of the best love stories I have ever read.  One can only imagine how excited I was when Allegiant was out, I could not get to the store fast enough to get it.  The way it was written is different than the other two books, almost has a feel that someone else wrote it lol.  Getting past that the ending was horrific, and I just wish I could unread the book because it completely ruined the series for me.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Katey Sagal's rendition of Leonard Cohen's Bird on a Wire is so hauntingly beautiful, it is worth the price of this CD if there were no other songs on it.  But there is the equally talented Audra Ray with Forever Young as I have never heard it.  This is one CD that is guaranteed not to disappoint.  Yes, I am a huge SOA fan! but even if you have been living under a rock and never heard of the show, the music is great.
B003M70O5O|5.0|It's the best show on TV.  Too bad HBO turned it down. Just when you think a season can't get any better...Sutter surprises you even more.  Forget all the unexpected events in Game of Thrones --- this show has them beaten threefold.

B00GD4IJ2S|5.0|Any new DG release with the Berlin Philharmonic is an eye-catcher these days, but this one featuring the return of Anne-Sophie Mutter seemed almost too good to be true.  The Dvorak Concerto hasn't gotten much treatment from high level orchestras, and Mutter has been away from the orchestra for a long time, so I worried that this was all a big PR affair.<br /><br />But my apprehensions quickly faded away as I listened to this account, which is grand with extra thrills.  Mutter's playing is lovely, but she gives her all with a spirit of heroism.  She chooses to emphasize the work's romanticism, giving it a feeling of forward motion.  Everything is emotional, almost heart-stopping, shying away from refinement in favor of near-sentimentality.  I think it's admirable that the concerto suddenly finds new drive and passion.  Some may think Mutter goes too far in her attempt to dig beneath the surface. She can slide into notes with a hint of schmaltz, especially at the start of the 2nd movement, but instead of detracting from the musical meaning, I find it to impart touching nostalgia.  What is undeniable is the power of the Berliners' playing, which is at once gorgeous and adventurous .  Manfred Honeck is a lesser name than most of the regulars in Berlin, but you'd never guess from his conducting, which is sparkling and imaginative.  There's none of the over-refinement that can afflict Simon Rattle and Honeck lets out all the stops in the finale--hooray.  After loving Maxim Vengerov's account with Kurt Masur with the New York Philharmonic, I wonder if it has found a match.  Certainly the accompaniment puts Masur's New York in the shade.<br /><br />DG hasn't been generous with fillers, but the two with the Berliners are a treat.  The Romance in F Minor is ravishingly beautiful, almost to the point of ecstasy.  But even better for me was the Mazurek, played with gypsy abandon with high points on the thrill factor.  Mutter charges with sheer energy and the Berliners let loose and are brilliantly fun.<br /><br />In the end, everything turns out in favor of this new release.  The orchestral accompaniment is dream quality and Mutter finds tantalizing emotion in every bar.and are brilliantly fun.<br /><br />In the end, everything turns out in favor of this new release.

She crosses generations of music lovers as fans of all ages go to see her perform. She puts on an incredible live show as well.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I read the first book after watching the Hunger Games and decided I should read this one in preparation for the movie coming out.  Catching Fire was an incredible book that had my gripping my kindle refusing to let it go.  I finished it while I was on vacation in London of all places when I should have had the good sense to explore the new city.  Luckily, it was so good that it didn't take me long to finish it but then I was forced to read Mockingjay, the 3rd and final book of the series.  Suzanne Collins can really captivate a reader with her interesting stories and her interesting characters.  I am rarely thrown or surprised anymore.  I usually can watch a movie or read a book and anticipate where it was going but this one continues to surprise me with her gruesome surprises.  I'm not sure if it is the horrible nature of the human race that draws me into the stories or if it is the characters or the writing style.  You would think that horrible would be a deterrent but surprisingly people are drawn to horrible stories for whatever reason.  Of course, seeing Peeta and Prim and Katniss in there inherently good nature brings a little bit of balance showing you that not everyone is bad.  In fact, most people were good in the story if you looked at the individual.  A lot of them were just dealt bad hands or were raised differently and Katniss tries to see why people do what they do and kind of explain it.  I think that makes her feel worse though.  It would be easy to write her victim off as the bad guy and her the good guy but for every person that she kills she finds a way to thicken her guilt load but explaining the other's actions.  He wasn't a bad guy; he was just raised to be a career and to bring pride to his district and family.  Or whatever the reason or person may be, she rationalizes everything and doesn't take the easy way out.  The story is so complicated and it is as if she wrote all three at the same time knowing how she wanted it to play out and introduces bread crumbs to the final piece.  This story seems to cut off in the middle of a larger story like a bad placed commercial that you hate so much because you really want to see the next part.  Don't get me wrong, it was strategically placed and well-placed but I hated the interruption.ces bread crumbs to the final piece.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read the Hunger Games after the movie came out and I recently read the second in preparation for Catching Fire coming to theaters.  It practically leaves you on a cliffhanger so I had no choice but to start the 3rd.  I was on vacation in London and despite being in such a wonderful place my mind kept wondering back to Mockingjay.  I had to know what came next and I had to see how it would play out.  It was that good that I couldn't put it down.  I carried my kindle everywhere with me.  Suzanne Collins has a great way of pulling you into a story.  The characters are unique and fascinating and you find yourself rooting for one or the other.  Who would Katniss Everdeen choose? Peeta or Gale? Or maybe she would do better on her own like Haymitch? The actual story is grotesque and I find myself hating the human race but I guess I sometimes feel that way myself.  I find myself having to make mental notes of nice things that people do for one another like Katniss just so I hold onto my own humanity.  The story isn't about good versus evil like most stories are.  It is complicated and twisted and more about power struggles.  In the end, I suppose the overturn of the Capital was a good thing as it seems like conditions did improve but perhaps Plutarch was the genius and it is only a momentary reprieve before the next struggle for power.  All the stories all have this sadness to them but this was the worst.  Depressing is what some of my friends call it and it was.  Her struggle to get her Peeta back and not just in a physical form but all of him.  Her struggle to come to terms with her new relationship with Gale and trying to see how they still fit together as team.  Her loss of her greatest treasure.  It was the one thing that started it all and ironically enough it was the one thing to end it all.  In the end, Katniss got her happy ending but it wasn't without a price and I'm sure she would trade the world to have it turn out differently.  But it appears she was awarded some happiness despite all the tragedy she was given.  There is no sugar-coated happy ending in the Hunger Games but it is a phenomenal story.some happiness despite all the tragedy she was given.

B008LXZFH6|3.0|Too long.  Funnt at the beginning but......gags got stale,  I watched this to prepare for Anchorman II.  Might skip that one and save my money.
B005SAP45I|5.0|This is a great childrens movie but it is not to say adults can't watch and enjoy. I for one love this movie and hope to see a sequel to it soon.

B004UFEJXK|5.0|Movie wasn't all that great but the visuals were outstanding.  Definitely a must have to show off your HD TV.
B00DU74U74|4.0|Beautiful cinematography. I thought the book was alright, obviously not the best out there, definetly better than that twilight whatever, but the movie was good as long as you forgot who wrote it. Saorise Ronan does wonderfully here and the cinematography was excellant.
B00C50NV2M|5.0|Very light and works great with my Sony 4k TV.  There is absolutely no crosstalk, and no headaches after hours of watching.  Passive 3D is definitely the way to go.

B00B7NPRY8|3.0|I'm enjoying this book, but I think it's a bit overrated.  The reviews on-line seem to indicate this is the greatest sci fi book ever.  Ehhh...not so sure about that.  The technology is not very imaginative.

B00AF6MF9I|1.0|Gameloft is a third rate company and this game is out of control. Constant resets, game steals your accomplishments, and they even resort to stealing what you pay for to make you buy more. BUYER BEWARE.
B008AX18Y6|3.0|Rushdie makes the reader sinks in details, names, places... He tends to settle down scores through this book with all the people he did not manage to get along with... That left a bit of a negative taste.

B008BM9L72|1.0|Please don't waste your time on this badly written book. I didn't even bother to finish it. THe story line is unbelievable and it is badly written. There is no hook in the story to make you want to read further.<br />I can't believe they're trying to make a movie out of this.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I simply loved this book!!! I could not put this book down for one minute! I highly recommended! Excellent!!  It had everything!
B004TSXUWY|5.0|Fantastic book, didn't want to put it down until it was finished. Found it very exciting and well written. Perfect book to read on a holiday
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I bought this movie after seeing in theaters.  Simon Pegg is one of my favorite actors now a days and Seth rogan is classic Seth Rogan...this version gave me some extra footage which did enhance the movie experience.
B0000WPADK|2.0|I am 31 and pretty good at building model trains.  The issue that i had with this one is that i got it for my 6 year old to simply hold/roll gently on the table.  By the time the wheels had spun aroung a few times the pistons started popping out of place.  The wheels did not line up with the tack very evenly.  It was just a bit of a diappointment considering all the time and energy that went into constructing it.  Some of the parts were so thin that even using wire cutters to remove them from the plastic sheets that they came in and using needle nose plyers to apply them into place the peices bent and broke and when the pistons started popping out of the mechanical setting for wheels and pistons the then bent bars would not set back in place and or snapped if I tried to re-bend them into shape
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I love these guys and so I have nothing truly bad to say other than I really wish Sam would cut his hair and be a little less whiney. But that is merely MY opinion...Sam used to be my favorite but I switched to Dean cause I found him to be more manlier and funny. I love a guy that can make me laugh.
B00G4CXHSK|1.0|The game is great...when it works, after the 3rd level the game freezes and shuts down after about 2 minutes of play...to bad I would play this a lot if it worked...I will probly be uninstalling
B004EPZ084|5.0|I freaking love this movie...funny, pervy, and just a great group of actors.  I ended up buying like three copies to give people for Christmas...this movie changed my life.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|thus is the best game and I play it every day. just wish that you could get energy a little bit faster.
B00008K7AM|2.0|great silly movie but I have purchased a few times and each disk skips....gave up after a while.  hope you find one that doesn't.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Time bombs are VERY frustrating! They Sometimes make the game unappealing and I just choose not to play which I don't think is the object of the creators.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Grew up with MTV so the fact that they put all the shows and the 2 movies all in one...Amazing buy. Worth the money compared to collecting all the beavis and butthead series.  Although those are good too.
0920668364|5.0|Received book in excellent condition and in a timely manner.  This is one of my all time favorite books.  I love giving this as a gift to new parents.
B00EVW04PE|5.0|Great movie.  We watched this with our two boys, ages 12 and 13.  They never took their eyes off the screen during the movie.  Never even moved !  Completely engrossed.<br />My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it as well.<br />Good find!
B008OJ291W|4.0|new theme on old music, it's great and is anice replaying of great music! I highly recommend this to all fans!
B002XXNSF6|3.0|Before Sunrise was an okay movie.  I watched it because of the hype but it wasn't that interesting to me.<br />I felt like I was watching a new couple having a simple conversation - which is probably the point -<br />but it was somewhat rambling.
B008O9V4C2|2.0|Just more of the same formula. It was a little redundant. Nothing really new and exciting for me. Nice try!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I'm not sure how I feel about this yet. I've been having issues on and off when using the Chromecast and I'm not sure if it's the product or what. It constantly cuts the broadcast off and I have to set it back up again. It also loses sync a lot so either the characters are speaking ahead or behind the dialogue and it's really annoying. It would be nice if it could be full screen in the TV without me having to sacrifice being able to use my computer while watching what I'm broadcasting on my TV (the way it currently works is if you want full screen on the TV it has to be full screen in your computer - so obviously you can't work on anything else if that's the case). It also wouldn't work on my older computer because the OS wasn't supported (and the OS isn't really that old). The set up was easy and I do use it a lot. Again, it's just not ideal right now so I would suggest maybe waiting until the next version comes out and it's improved significantly before I would suggest anyone purchasing this. I have a Roku so when I want to watch movies/tv shows via my Amazon Prime account, Netflix and Hulu I just use that instead of the Chromecast because it's easier and the quality is better as well. The only differences between Roku and Chromecast (for me) are that the quality/consistency in playback is better with Roku but with CC I can cast something from my Chrome tabs so that's great but if they could plug it in to more of my programs and apps (like for editing) that would be awesome.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|Love this app! I listen every day connected with Bluetooth on my Braven portable speaker at work and it's fantastic!  Glad to have it!
B006W0QR1S|5.0|This is such an amazing movie! The cinematography is absolutely stunning and the music production is top notch. Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan are superb and the story is really fantastic. Definitely check it out!

B0046B8GEQ|4.0|It was a cute movie. I wish the minions would have been in it a little more but it was adorable, regardless. Kids will love it!
B000SEFNMS|2.0|Didn't enjoy this book too much. Probably based on the subject matter. Would be good for someone who enjoys the outdoors.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|This is such a great show. It's well written and the actors have amazing comedic timing and delivery. Hilarious! I never miss an episode!
B00F0N7JUG|5.0|Love the collector's edition of this movie. Have now watched it over 7 times.. think I may watch it again tonight!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|After a short dearth of books I didn't like, it seems I've hit a few that I do. I liked \\"Wool\\" quite a lot. I thought the story was a good piece of human drama and adventure set up in an environment that would otherwise seem difficult to have an adventure in. I'm not generally fond of killing POV characters early in a story, but this one made it work pretty well. I found myself caring about the characters and their plight, which is good.<br /><br />That said, there are some basic \\"oh please\\" world-building and physical problems with this story. (Looking for physical problems and world-building hiccups is a big part of what I read for.)<br /><br />The idea of people dying in order to clean a sensor mast struck me as frivolous on first read. A basic facet of engineering is to design maintainability into an apparatus. Engineers are industrious that way. If there are a couple thousand people within yards of the device and it's expected to endure a hostile environment there will have been a design feature included to take advantage of those people to maintain it which doesn't include killing them --think periscope or windshield wipers. I came to forgive this flaw because the story around it was well enough written and I later decided that it could be overlooked given deeper background in the world. The design of the silo, including this sensor mast, is deliberately cruel.<br /><br />I came to question the silo stairway a couple times. In some points, it's presented as a straight-shot top to bottom, but sometimes presented as if the shaft could be discontinuous: the author speaks at one point that someone considering jumping off the stairway doesn't necessarily have a straight shot to the bottom and must pick where they jump off with care, which makes no sense if it's a constant pitch spiral all the way down. It's unclear at points if the landings on the stairway span the entire shaft or if they're a short dock on one side or the other of it. Also, the author makes big use of porters carrying stuff up and down the stairs and I had to stop and ask \\"where the hell are the bucket pulleys??\\" One of those big singular features of \\"humanity\\" is ingenuity applied to avoid labor (we don't just build devices to be cruel or because we like playing with gadgets)... big open shaft with lots of commerce going up and down, any real population would rebel if prohibited from using pulley systems. Again, this can be explained away by the inherent cruelty in the silo's design and governance and there may have been a brief notation at one point to explain this away, but I do not recall it.<br /><br />Still, there are also some basic physical problems in the story surrounding the silo. First, the Down Deep at the bottom of the silo is sometimes referred to as \\"the cold of the down deep\\" and so on. In reality, the Down Deep would be the warmest part of the silo. The Earth does get warmer as you go deeper into it. This is the basis of geothermal power. I find it hard to imagine people worrying about freezing in an environment that is always 60 degrees F and hotter. This is forgivable because it's minor. Second, it is never very clear exactly how tall the floors of the silo are, but it is implied by how long it takes to walk them that they are taller than the floors in a skyscraper... with an open shaft this deep into the ground, there would be a significant difference in pressure of the atmosphere from top to bottom. This could easily play into how hard it is for people to climb it, and so it is forgivable. On the flip-side, however, the main character must swim several hundred feet downward through flooded silo levels at one point --but when she must hurry back from this (or die of suffocation), she never confronts pressure narcosis even though she starts with a breathing apparatus.<br /><br />Within this swimming into the Deep Down section, it's implied that water inhibits rusting and that equipment in flooded sections are preserved by the presence ofwater. This is not true: dissolved gases rust metals in water and dissolved ions, acids and such, can corrode them.<br /><br />There is one additional fairly big physical problem that figures into the plotting of the story. The character uses a sheet of \\"heat tape\\" to confront and survive what amounts to an oven. Tape can't fundamentally be useful in this situation. There is still some argument about what makes tape \\"sticky,\\" but it's generally agreed that it's a combination of viscosity of the substance on the tape and gas bubbles trapped in that substance. Viscosity decreases with increasing temperature and gas expands. The combination of these two factors against the intensity of fire means that the tape will stop sticking pretty much immediately since tape-like stickiness is not compatible with heat. And so, her heat shield of tape strips would just fall apart. Again, this problem is fairly minor, but it can't be tape... it would have to be an epoxy or silcone-like glue, something that reacts to polymerize and maintain its bonding, and even these must be specially designed to resist heat. And, surviving fire, you want something with a high heat capacity: a water shield or a ceramic barrier and combined with something shiny with differential reflectance to radiate away the infrared.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed a section where a character is essentially in the process of rediscovering radio and convincingly using electronic components. The one potential hiccup here is that a radio you can carry does not emit radiation that penetrates the Earth, concrete or steel construction. Some of these waves only penetrate a short distance through the air, even. It would therefore require something beyond just radiowaves or microwaves for the characters to be picking up broadcasts originating from elsewhere. I will not say the \\"elsewhere\\" where these signals came from, but suffice it to say, they had to have come through the Earth, which is not realistic. I consider this minor because there are other potential unelucidated elements of the infrastructure that might be used to explain it away.<br /><br />Despite my outlining these problems, and I do outline them because nobody else probably will, they weren't enough to stop me from reading... which says quite a lot about how well the story was written. I have acquired \\"Shift\\" and \\"Dust\\" both. To give context to my responses here; I acquired \\"Dust\\" first and read the first few chapters... when I realized that was the continuation of a story I hadn't read, I went back looking for the early parts because my first impressions of \\"Dust\\" were just that good. I was almost immediately guaranteed to read \\"Shift.\\"

B00EL6ACOI|5.0|This documentary is amazing and eye opening. It tells the story of Tillikum, a killer whale that has been in captivity at Sea World since he was 2 years old. This heart warming movie will make you laugh, cry and feel emotions for these brilliant mammals.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this movie enough! I saw it twice when CNN aired it, and I pre-ordered it as soon as I saw it was available.<br /><br />The special features are a nice add-on with additional interviews from experts and former trainers.<br /><br />The Blu Ray visuals are stunning. Don't miss out on this incredible movie!
B001BANK32|5.0|I loved finally reading the book after having seen the movie many times.  As always Stephen King tells a great horror story and having seen the movie first will NOT spoil the book.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|This is an amazing book, a must read.  Malcolm Gladwell's engaging style and fascinating research gives us an excellent perspective on what it is about those &#34;underdogs&#34;, those out of the loop, and their ability to overcome adversity.  Loved it!
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Meh.. Good graphics, predictable and a little cheesy at times, I feel like I have seen it before in some way.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|I'm an independent author and I've just bought two books on how to market my books. I read each book on my kindle, each cost 2.99, each was written by an author.  The first book shared case studies of marketing ideas that sold anywhere from no books to 50 books. The second book, this one, was written by someone who has sold MILLIONS of books. Yup, they both tried things that don't work, and they both have successes to report.  But I would for sure rather sell thousands of books on a good day than just fifty, wouldn't you?<br /><br />John Locke has the sales credentials to back up his advice.  That's important.  But more than that, he is a nice guy. No where in his book did I find hard sell tactics.  Instead, I read about how to use social media to develop relationships, and how to nurture those relationships into a community of mutually supportive friends and fans. I read about how to identify my target audience, and then learn from them how best to serve them.  I learned how to be accessible and authentic (Well, I already am, but John takes accessible to an amazing level!) I learned some specific things that I am going to try, and which I think just might radically change my visibility as an author.<br /><br />I don't believe in taking anyone's advice without question, and there are some things he wrote that I completely disagree with.  But he gave me lots that did make sense to me, and that I can't wait to try.<br /><br />If you are an author, you need to read this book.  I'm grateful I did.

B0025UHKNS|2.0|I bought the Garmin Forerunner to use for running and initially was pleased with the ease of use and details provided.  They auto-sync worked well.  But within a few weeks, the GPS started to wane.  First it took a few extra minutes to locate position and go to 'start' mode.  Then longer...then longer.  Now it is essentially useless - by the time it locates and connects with satellites, I'm almost 20 minutes into my 30 minute run.  I've dropped it into a drawer, reverted to my old trusty Timex watch to time my runs and am searching for a replacement.  It will NOT be a Garmin.
0316201545|2.0|I purchased the audiobook of the first installment and our family listened to it during a vacation by car. My kids enjoyed the Bailey twins' first adventure in The Land of Stories enough that I wanted to check out the sequel. That said, as an avid reader of Middle Grade fiction who leads a book club aimed squarely at this demographic, I found Colfer's first endeavor to be somewhat spotty. The flaws certainly were forgivable in a first effort and I hoped the follow-up would show evidence of lessons learned (and tighter editing). The opposite turned out to be true. I realized by the time I'd reached midway through \\"The Enchantress Returns\\" that Alex and Connor only were starting the main journey. They complete each of their primary tasks in the span of a single chapter. The self-discovery process for Alex suffers from severe neglect, rendering her major decision at the end somewhat empty. A character introduced early in the story mysteriously re-appears near the very end without any effort to carry his significance to the twins' lives through the rest of the plot. Compared to Evly, the Enchantress is a hollow caricature. Quirky characterization does not compensate for the story's lack of heart or a cohesive plot arc. Colfer's authoring efforts on \\"Struck by Lightning\\" by comparison are executed with far more finesse, so he's clearly capable. I still feel that Colfer's TLOS concept has promise, but he did not receive the editorial coaching that could have made \\"The Enchantress Returns\\" truly shine.
B003CHGV74|5.0|Breaking Bad is Addictive!<br />Because it's great.  Acting and production values are superb.  Plot is riveting.<br />Ties with The Sopranos for best TV series, ever.
B00EVW04PE|2.0|These are really good actors doing really really bad acting.  Terrible waste of good talent.  Could have been a good movie but the lines were were a joke and most of the movie was simply unbelievable.  A big disappointment, especially since most of these actors have been in good movies.  Actually, Olympus Down was a considerably good movie after watching this one.<br /><br />Don't wast your money.
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|MOvie was slow moving and vague.  I rented the movie based on the ratings from Rotten Tomatoes.  I don't see what gave it the great rating it got.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I've been using Calengoo for more than a year on a first generation Kindle Fire and it works very well.  There was no problem installing it and I was able to immediately customize it so it syncs up with my Google calendar which is synced with two desktop MS Outlook calendars.  It's set to automatically do this every two hours and I have full access to my calendars wherever I am. I can also opt to make it sync immediately after an entry is changed or edited.<br /><br />I can make changes or additions to the calendar on the Kindle and it will sync with my Google and Outlook calendars and it also works in the other direction: changes made on either of both desktops Outlook calendars sync up with Google and then the CalenGoo calendars on the Kindle.  Best of both worlds!<br /><br />I can make a to-do list and view daily/weekly/monthly versions of the calendar. I really love this app and it's one I use every day.
0525478817|5.0|Yes I know my title's a little corny, but I stand by the fact that this book is one of the best realistic fiction novels in a long time. John Green is an exceptional author who has the ability to transfer every emotion within the story to that of the reader who is simultaneously reading along. Based off the myriad summaries online, this book might seem like a mushy-gushy fairy tale, but, Green quickly severs that idea with a sharp knife. However, if you find that it's not just a good storyline that defines a book, but rather the portrayal of characters that does the trick; this is exactly the case in The Fault in Our Stars. The sheer brilliance of how every character has a uniquely strong personality and voice makes the reader hungry for more. With every sentence that transpires, we understand the main characters, Hazel and Augustus, with having acquired one more piece to the puzzle. Whether a young adult, or past the \\"teen\\" stage, this book is perfect for someone who wants to experience a situation that one can relate to in the perfect amount. This is a story that will not only have you distraught with anticipation whilst reading it, but also have you pondering your own life decisions well after you've put the book down. Though not every single event might seem plausible, in the end, The Fault in Our Stars is nothing short of amazing. At times this book will make you furious. At times it will make you laugh. And most of the time this novel will make you cry. In general, every word in this book will make you feel an emotion that you might not have even known you had. If you want a good read, read this book. Only, beforehand make sure some tissues are nearby.
1400067820|3.0|The author philosophizes on the academic domains of economics, sociology, philosophy and, to some degree, evolution.  However, herein lies his first conundrum as he repeatedly states that he is anti-academia and the philosophy of epistemology.  I found extremely fascinating, thought provoking suggestions and ideas that were cutting edge philosophically. However, his digressions into metaphor and exaggerations ruined some topics he was attempting to review.  As the author often states (don't read this as it is complicated), this is not a book for just anyone and certainly not \\"light reading.\\"  Overall, I enjoyed the authors \\"mind games\\", however, his biases, usually negative as discussed, distracted from his critical work and subject matter.  I did find the book extremely interesting as being from Western culture and world view, it was provocative to read mid-eastern philosophical perspective.

B00DW1WR14|5.0|I have been a Pearl Jam fan since the early 1990's and have all of their albums.  &#34;Lightning Bolt&#34; is my favorite of all of the albums.  Pearl Jam shows a grounded maturity that is both stimulating and familiar.  Again, I can find myself and my own life story in these songs and I have since &#34;Ten&#34;  The album is both dark and light, sad and loving, high and low.  Definitely on repeat on my player.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|It's gory, bloody and scary, but surprisingly, I love it!  Zombie apocalypse is the reason why they are all where they are, but the real point to this story is morality and friendship, which it portrays very well despite the fact that you constantly have to cover your eyes in fear.  It makes you question how you would be if this were to ever happen to us.  One of the best series I have ever watched.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Best IronMan yet. Great story line, even if you are not a fan of the comic book hero, I feel you would appreciate the movie.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I liked the excitement and action part and then Veronica Roth changed to love story without missing a beat. I just think there were to many deaths in the book
1451648545|4.0|This is a powerful biography of a powerful man.  While most of us may not agree with the way he &#34;handled&#34; those who worked for him, one has to admire his creativity and quest for perfection.
0307887448|4.0|The book is from a 18-year-old orphaned boy's POV.  He's a geek and finds comfort, friedship, and support in the virtual world circa 2044.<br /><br />If you can go beyond the slow start (patagonist had to explain everything but that's ok because he's a kid and that's what kids do), you will greatly enjoy the book for what it is, a good YA story.<br /><br />Also, you will love it if you are into gaming, pop culture, 80's/90's, music, anime, tv shows, movies.<br /><br />The plot is kind of predictable.  I knew what would happen before it happens.  The fun part was how the writer brought it out.  It was like playing a game, you knew what's ahead but because of the design it's still a cool ride.<br /><br />The author did insert a few \\"messages\\" on the topics of religion, government, corporation, sexual orientation, social acceptance based on appearance, relationship, etc..  Some he tried to sell harder than the others.<br /><br />What I feel excited about is the movie (Warner Brothers got the rights).  I hope the studio will break it into a trilogy (after all, there are 3 keys).  It can be done in 3D animation since most scenes were in the virtual world.  If done by the right adpatation, direction, and CGI, this will be a very entertaining film.
1476727651|4.0|I really enjoyed finding out what happened to Danny all these years later and was happy that King was so faithful to his masterpiece, &#34;The Shining&#34;.  I was, however, disappointed that there were absolutely no scares at all in this book.  Halfway though &#34;The Shining&#34; you are wishing someone would kill you so you could stop being so afraid, but in &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; I kept waiting and waiting but no joy with no fear at all.  The story was sound, the writing was tight, and I'm still thinking about it days after reading it.  I'm even hoping King will continue with book 3 about Abra's life.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Not finished watching the entire season yet, but what I've seen is truly amazing.  One of the best series out there today!
1401917232|4.0|I'm a big fan of Gary Renard, and I did like this newest book.<br /><br />However, I was expecting something \\"new\\" over and above what was in his last two books (\\"The Disappearance of the Universe\\" and \\"Your Immortal Reality\\") and I don't think it delivered on that.<br /><br />Toward the end of this book, it's said that this is the completion of a trilogy (the books I mentioned above being parts one and two). And I only just now noticed that on the inside flap it does describe it as \\"the final installment of his trilogy\\". I didn't realize that when I decided to read it, and I think if I had, my expectations would have been better set.<br /><br />As part of a trilogy and a continuation of the other two, it was fine ... even good.<br /><br />I don't think you would have to read the others first, but my favorite was \\"The Disappearance of the Universe\\" and I think it does set the stage for the others.<br /><br />This one is interesting but it didn't add a lot more to my understanding or experience of the main ideas.<br /><br />Radical<br /><br />When I first read \\"The Disappearance of the Universe\\", it blew me away. Not only because two ascended masters appear to Gary in form, but also because what they claim to be true is so astounding.<br /><br />Over the years since then, I've come around to that way of thinking, so \\"Love Has Forgotten No One\\" was not quite as radical to me.<br /><br />Still, it's pretty wild, and an excellent reinforcement of a way of life that you won't find in the mainstream media.<br /><br />There are a lot of great statements that I'm sure I'll come back to, and I'm glad I read it and have it to refer to.<br /><br />In particular, if you find yourself struggling with forgiveness, this trilogy is not to be missed.<br /><br />A Course in Miracles<br /><br />As you may know, the entire trilogy is a discourse on \\"A Course in Miracles\\" (ACIM). It's an unconventional way to frame it and Gary's books really helped me make sense of it in a new and expansive way.<br /><br />I've never made it all the way through ACIM myself, but this has gotten me enthused all over again, and ready to get back into it.<br /><br />You will probably find yourself wanting to do the course as well, or if you already have, you may look at it with new eyes.<br /><br />How Our Universe Works<br /><br />There are also a few chapters that detour a bit from the main theme and explain some fascinating ideas about how things work. I didn't find them especially useful in a practical sense but they were definitely interesting and I enjoyed reading them.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />So in the end, I do recommend this book.<br /><br />If you decide to read it, I suggest you suspend any disbelief and go with it. You'll get a lot more out of it that way, and if you actually apply what's suggested, your experience of life will open up in new and miraculous ways!<br /><br />Note: I received this book for free from Hay House Publishing for review purposes, yet rest assured this review reflects my honest evaluation.
B000UR9QIK|5.0|There's just something about Dawn Of The Dead (the original, not the okay but hyper-banal 2004 remake).  It somehow manages to rise above the zombie genre, the horror genre, the survival genre, the 70s schlock genre - no matter how you try to pigeonhole this movie, it stands alone.  And despite having seen it now innumerable times since the advent of home video, I'm still not quite sure why.  Because there's most certainly a \\"then\\" and \\"now\\" aspect to viewing the film.  \\"Then\\" the movie was controversial because of its OTT gore - now, you see more gruesome effects on commercials.  \\"Then\\", of course, the film felt like it might be happening out there, somewhere, right now - now, despite being post-apocalyptic, this film is as 1978 as a 1978 fly trapped in 1978 amber (just watching it makes me smell waterbeds and ferns).  \\"Then\\", the shopping mall actually was a very important place, exciting and new - now, people may still be going to malls, I don't know, but they are certainly whale bone farmhouses that can be avoided.  Yet somehow the trappings that should mire this movie in the past actually allow its better points to shine out more clearly as time passes.  All Romero zombie flicks are essentially \\"12 Angry Men\\"-esque stage plays thrown into a stew of the undead - so now that the \\"shock/slock\\" aspects are kind of nullified by time, the core of characters has to carry the weight of the film and that they certainly do (unless you're just interested in having brains splattered on you in 3D in which case just skip this one and find the latest digital gore fest to stir your innards).<br /><br />Of course, the general idea of most zombie movies is not zombies at all, but the actions of the survivors, especially the negative interactions between characters as the foibles and pettiness of the human species continues to assert itself, even in the face of extinction.  From a certain point of view, the zombies might be considered the \\"good guys\\", or humanity in a pure stateof utopian harmony - they like each other - the only thing they dislike are humans and, generally, by the end of the movie (if not before) we share their negative point of view, even if we aren't quite ready to disembowel and consume the characters.  And that, I think, is what makes Dawn of the Dead special - you have 4 characters who, despite minor disagreements and bickering, work together and genuinely lean on each other in a way that makes you identify and root for them.  In \\"Night Of\\" the male protagonists are simply interested in asserting their dominance, while the females meekly do what they are told, and everybody goes down with that ship.  In \\"Day Of\\", everybody is so nasty that it's hardly a tragedy when it all goes wrong.  However, even the biker gang in Dawn Of The Dead comes across more as heedless hedonists living in the moment than any sort of evil assortment of humanity's worst traits.  So you might say that Dawn of the Dead is the only pro-human zombie film, even in its depiction of zombies, because, rather than a mindless horde of rotting flesh, the low budget necessity of having people depict zombification through facial ticks and grey paint allows them to assert identities and humanity (however putrified) that is touching in its own way.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt that this is the only movie to explore the possibility of living in a mall after the apocalypse, with unlimited power.  And the movie is full of humor - it pervades the film so that the tragic moments actually take on a poignant sting, as opposed to the whole thing being a never ending tide of gloom re: The Walking Dead for example (which I do like, but it could certainly use more levity to offset its own self-importance).

0316204366|4.0|Reading Gladwell's description of the Biblical tale of David's battle with Goliath, I began to have a bit of trepidation about where the book would led. This, along with the story of Noah's ark, is one of the most commonly told story in Sunday School classes and often many details of the story are omitted or smoothed over for young ears (David chopping off Philistine's head with his own story isn't usually exactly highlighted.)<br />I have enjoyed all of Gladwell's other books, so I wasn't concerned that the book would not be well written or interesting.<br />But I was concerned that Gladwell was going to turn a story about a boy's faith in God into a story primarily about tactics. He points out that ancient armies often divided into cavalry, infantry and shooters (with slings or bows), and that infantry man would often lose out to a man well trained with a sling at a distance. He also speculates that Goliath's great height may suggest a disease or aliment that would have put him in to less than fit fighting shape. These are reasonable suppositions, but what does the story really have to say or teach if we leave out the element of faith in God.<br />Fortunately, Gladwell's book is not lacking in the vital spiritual element. He obviously was concerned about issues of faith. In fact, in the acknowledgments, he credits his \\"theological consultant, Jim Loepp Thiessne of the Gathering Church in Kitchener, Ontario\\". He prefaces each section of the book with an appropriate passage of Scripture.<br />And most significantly, he presents stories of people from history and the present whose battles with giants relied greatly on their faith in God. From the last century, he highlights people of faith (including Fred Shuttlesworth, the \\"swearing preacher\\") in the civil rights movement who mobilized churches to do God's work against segregation. He highlights the work of the Huguenots in France who saved thousands of Jews from the Vichy (and Nazi regiemes.) And ordinary people like Wilma Derksen who obeyed God's call to forgive the man who murdered her daughter.<br />The book is full of wonderful stories about people who took on odds that seemed too great to achieve personal success, but more often fought for the good of others. Not only does the book give a perceptive look at the battle of Elah, it also provides many illustrations of people living out the Sermon on the Mount.ke Wilma Derksen who obeyed God's call to forgive the man who murdered her daughter.<br />The book is full of wonderful stories about people who took on odds that seemed too great to achieve personal success, but more often fought for the good of others.

I have been in Coronado for Hell Week and I have spent time with SEALS deployed to the Philippines.  Every one is an amazing individual fully deserving of our highest respect.  Did I say I highly respect SEALS?  The story of Chris Kyle's life as a SEAL is exceptional and well-written.  That portion of his book that brings in the tension between his life as a SEAL and life as a husband gives great dimension to his story.  His description of his life in combat is riveting.  Don't pass this one by!

B0071NOU78|5.0|Awesome toy. Bought this for my son's birthday and to complete his Luke Skywalker Halloween costume. He loved it. I had purchased the blue Obi Wan light saber for my costume. We've had endless light saber duels since and these things are impressive. They take a beating and keep working like new. And for anyone curious, yes, the blade is green which is a plus because I'd looked at every toy store in town and all I could find was red or blue.

B00B7FOQCK|3.0|Updated Review:<br />After recieving my replacement I thoroughly tested it and am happy with it. There are a few things that you must know when getting this device.<br />1: it is not a high powered device, in fact if I plug in my external drive from Anker, and my mouse at the same time, they will both drop on and offline regularly; however, if you plug your external drive into a seperate powersource then connect multiple devices you get no problems.<br />2: As many people have stated, the ports are very tight, but I have found that as long as I am carefull I can plug all of my devices without problem.<br />3: Besides that I would suggest reading Anker's tech document on the device as it specifies what it does and does not do, as well as the power restrictions.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />I have been buying Anker devices for a couple of years now. I have always thought that they were great for the price. However; over the last year I have been getting device after device that either comes non-functional or breaks shortly after I have recieved it. This is another example, I purchased this to extend my USB 3.0 on my Surface Pro, but it isn't even detected. I thought perhaps it was an issue with Microsoft's proprietary drivers so I tried it on two other devices with the same results. It is not even detected. I have contacted Anker support, but as ussual they do not respond the same day, so it takes days to resolve if you have to corispond more than once... If they replace it and the new device functions well I will modify my rating...

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|After I first finished it, I thought I was disappointed. I didn't feel it met the bar of true Grisham.  However, as time passes, I find my self continually thinking about the main character, Jake Brigance, as if he were a real person.  That is definitely a sign of good literature when the characters come alive.  So in retrospect it is very good.

What is with all the religious right wing stuff?  they say something about Krypton using birth control that is what destroyed it etc etc.  Very anti- woman!  Also,  do the writers of this know drones have killed lots of terrorists!  are Crowe and company for the terrorists.  I thought the was the WORST Superman movie ever done!  DC comics should sue!

B000XUBFE2|5.0|The way this book was narrated put an extra dimension to the story.  I read  a number of discounted books on amazon kindle and walk away saying ok read. This is an exception!  Well written, heart felt and a different way of observing the German lives in  world war 'll.  The author had no trouble bringing me into this young girl's life.  She felt real and the story felt true.

B00EW9GQR6|2.0|This album is so bad it compelled me to write my first ever product review on Amazon.  I love Lady Gaga, have her previous albums, have all of her songs starred on Spotify and have even seen her in concert.  I had high hopes considering how good the single Applause is.  But no.  As I listened to the album I found myself wanting it to not really be the REAL album.  Maybe this is just a pre-release.  Maybe the REAL album will be coming out next and it will be good.  But no.  This is the real album, and it's a real turd.
B00G3DA5XA|5.0|There may be spoilers.<br /><br />I think I will have to clear room on my Top Ten list for 2013 for this beautiful little film about two teenagers finding each other.  Director James Ponsoldt has affectionately taken Tim Tharp's novel and slowly allows the characters to fall in love while the audience watches.  I can't say enough about Miles Teller (\\"Project X\\") and Shailene Woodley's (proving her performance in \\"The Descendants\\" was no fluke) strong chemistry together which results in exceptional performances.  Nothing seems like dialog, just extemporaneous words flowing from their mouths.<br /><br />Sutter (Teller) is a high school senior who is perhaps best known as the class clown.  He's funny, easily approachable and good to be around.  He's not a jock nor the smartest kid in school.  But he likes school.  His biggest problem is that he is drunk most of the time.  Sometimes just pleasantly drunk, sometimes very drunk.  One day after a party, he shows up on the lawn of a classmate he barely knows.  Aimee (Woodley) helps her mom deliver newspapers and her never-seen mom got in late, so Aimee scoops up Sutter and off they go delivering papers at 6 AM.<br /><br />The casting is perfect for this movie.  Both actors (and supporting actors as well) look and talk like high school seniors.  Neither are the traditional Hollywood studs and starlets you typically find in movies like this.  While I suspect their looks were purposely dressed down, they look...well... average.  So does Sutter's ex-girlfriend and his best friend.  So does Aimee's friend.  How refreshing.  As the shy Aimee and extroverted Sutter spend more time together, bad and good characteristics rub off on each other.  Each helps the other confront their mothers.<br /><br />In Sutter's case, his mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh) won't tell him about his father's whereabouts.  It's been years since he's heard from him.  I expected the bomb to be dropped that dad is in prison or something.  When he eventually gets the phone number from his married sister (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), he and Aimee make the 3 hour drive.  Unfortunately dad (Kyle Chandler) is a drunk womanizer, pretty much like his mother suggested.<br /><br />No matter how old we are, everyone can remember that first love.  It never leaves our memory.  I can promise that \\"The Spectacular Now\\" will give those memories a bit of a jolt.  This is an authentic film about young love.  Highly recommended.s the phone number from his married sister (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), he and Aimee make the 3 hour drive.

B004SGWYVA|5.0|Not a fan of anime but this series was awesome. Funny, full of gore, everybody is easily loved or hated and the entire thing leaves you wanting more when all is said and done. I literally gave like 10 other anime series a shot after this and none of them were even close. I still dislike 99.9% of all anime, but this is that one exception. The &#34;fan service&#34; was a bit over the top at first but it becomes hilarious as the series continues. So glad I bought it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Simply put.  Amazing.  I purchased two of these for easy roving through the house.  One upstairs and one downstairs.  For me the use of youtube on this is great for everyone.  The kids can jump on and control their videos with ease.  As more and more jump on board and support this it can only get better.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Very good book. If you've read Elantris you'll see some similarities, but this book is very original - 100 days in a prison, and still very interesting!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Child's Reacher  books are a sub-genre  similar to John Wayne or Shane westerns .  A pleasurable read filled with interest insights and trivia.  Nothing deep here just fun
B008JFUQZ2|4.0|There may be spoilers.<br /><br />Director and co-writer Guillermo del Toro and I have one thing in common.  We both grew up watching all those black and white \\"monster\\" films from the 1950's.  That includes Godzilla which is certainly an inspiration here.<br /><br />In the near future, a crack in the Pacific seabed has unleashed a series of giant creatures (Kaiju) that attack the great coastal cities of the world.  Standard warfare (planes, tanks, missiles, etc.) while somewhat effective also manage to destroy the cities.  So a new weapon is quickly created.  An equally large robot.  Think of a combination of \\"Iron Man\\" (2008) and the fighting robots from \\"Real Steel\\" (2011) only 30 stories tall.  Inside the head of each Jaeger (German for \\"hunter\\") there are 2 pilots.  There are two reasons.  First, one pilot doesn't have the strength to maneuver the Jaeger, as it mimics the actions of the pilot.  But in order to get the strength of 2 pilots, they must move and work in unison.<br /><br />In a pretty cool plot point, a method is developed where they mind-meld.  This has side effects, however, which includes a display of memories that both pilots experience.  This includes their own memories and those of their partner.  As the Kaiju are now appearing more frequently and in pairs, the Jaeger project's leader, Marshall Stacker Pentecost (great performance by Idris Elba), prepares for a final battle.  With only 4 Jaegers at his disposal, he plans to drop a nuclear bomb in the crack, which will hopefully seal the Kaiju into their death tomb.<br /><br />While this goes on from the Marshall's Hong Kong headquarters, the rest of the world is busy building giant walls.  Yeah, good luck with that.  The 4 teams consist of one from Japan, whose pilots play basketball most of the time.  They wear red jump suits which matches their Jaeger.  Another is a blond man and woman from Russia.  Both of these teams never speak and are played by unrecognizable actors.  Want to guess what happens to them?  Another team is a father and son (Max Martini and Robert Kazinsky) from Australia.  Finally we have our hero, Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) a former crack pilot who dropped out 5 years earlier when his co-pilot and older brother was eaten by a Kaiju while on assignment in coastal Alaska.  He needs a partner and it just so happens there is this cute, trained but untested Japanese gal known as Mako (Rinko Kikuchi).<br /><br />But Marshall Pentecost is reluctant to let her pair up.  Of course, he relents in the end.  I believe I counted 3 big battles with the Kaiju and they are all very well done.  The combatants are huge and so is the production.  The CGI is very effective.  I was also very fond of the Kaiju themselves.  We don't have to wait long to see one up close and personal either.  Take the look of monsters from Godzilla to the Alien creature, toss in some dragon and you have one creepy alien.<br /><br />Oh yeah, that's where all these guys get here.  In a plot point that is glossed over, Earth's dinosaurs were just an exploratory party for some alien planet that attacks and consumes other planets.  I thought this was an interesting but undeveloped point.  While Idris Elba seems to elevate the film with his sheer presence, the movie has more than a few stumbling blocks.  First and foremost is the comic relief pairing of Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as competitive scientists trying to find out more about the creatures in order to predict their movement and attacks.  Some will welcome their appearance, for me it was distracting.  A del Toro veteran, Ron Perlman (\\"Hellboy\\") makes an appearance as a savvy merchant dealing in dead Kaiju parts.<br /><br />\\"Pacific Rim\\" rises above many of its ilk by adding some simple but emotional story lines.  Elba gives the film a certain gravitas and the film certainly looks good.  At the same time, it is loud, predictable, full of clich&eacute;s and too long.  For the genre, it's pretty damn good.  Pass the Jagermeister.

1568363931|5.0|I bought this book because I was tired of sandwiches everyday for lunch and I thought this cook book might offer suggestions. It's a very easy to follow cookbook, with some pretty simple, but great tasting recipes (the tsukiyaki is especially delicious). It also lists alternatives to ingredients which are good for variations. Overall I think it's a great cook book for people who are interested in bentos (either to lose weight or because they're convenient) but think that charaben is a little too much work.

B0090SI56Y|4.0|There may be spoilers.<br /><br />I have to admit I was beginning to wear out my ears with the usual summer onslaught of loud, violent (but PG-13 of course) action films.  Mostly due to the overlong final acts.  I was expecting something similar here but surprise, the movie is good from beginning to end.  Sure the final sequence is a bit much but there aren't cities, skylines or military manpower and armament being destroyed.<br /><br />We first see Logan aka The Wolverine hanging out in the rain in a Yukon forest.  He's still despondent after killing his beloved Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) in a previous X-Men episode.  He still dreams about her.  I did think the numerous sequences were a bit of a distraction.  A young Japanese swordswoman (Rila Fukushima) has tracked Logan down and asks him to come to Tokyo to say goodbye to an old, dying man (Hal Yamanouchi) whose life was saved by Logan when the \\"Big One\\" was dropped on Nagasaki to close out WW II.<br /><br />Once there, Logan discovers that Yashida is indeed on his death bed but also one of the great high-tech industrialists in Japan.  His impending death is creating a power struggle between his son, his granddaughter, corrupt politicians and the Yakusa crime lords.  Logan picks cute Mariko (Tao Okamoto), the granddaughter to hang with and of course protect.<br /><br />There are additional complications.  Logan's ability to quickly heal are waning thanks to a long-stemmed blond temptress called Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) who is also a chemist working with Yashida to extend his life.  Maybe the Wolverine's powers can be fed to the old man?<br /><br />Director James Mangold, working with writers Mark Bomback and Scott Frank, are to be commended for making Logan's character down to Earth while not removing his fierceness.  As the relationship between Logan and Mariko becomes...uh...closer, he still keeps a distance understanding that her character will likely not work in future storylines.  Action fans should not be disappointed either.  There are plenty of well-choreographed fight scenes early on and throughout the film, the best being Logan vs. a Yakusa henchman in and on top of a speeding bullet train.  Sure, we've seen this before including this year in \\"The Lone Ranger.\\"  But speed does make a difference.<br /><br />This is a well-made, exciting take on the graphic novel and certainly atones for \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009).\\"be disappointed either.

B008JFUS0U|2.0|I know that I'm going against the trend of rave reviews here, but if I'm going to be honest, I was really disappointed by Thor: The Dark World.  For all its eye-popping CGI and grand cosmic scale, the film really seems to alternate between constant unrelenting exposition for the first half and then going to the opposite extreme with bewildering jumping about that frequently seems to generate more heat than light, especially when it comes to understanding what's supposed to be happening (other than the most basic 'good guys trying to stop bad guys from destroying the universe' anyway).<br /><br />It's not the fault of the actors. Chris Hemsworth delivers once in fine form once again as Thor. And Tom Hiddleston's Loki... what can I say?  Tom Hiddleston _is_ a god, stealing every scene he's in. Let Asgard and Earth fall! It'd be worth it just to get to watch Hiddleston's Loki gloat over it. Idris Elba's Heimdall once again lends some much needed somber gravitas to the scenes he's in, but it's Zachary Levi's Fandral who really brings on the Errol Flynn/Douglas Fairbanks panache of Asgard being a place where the Norse gods lived for the sheer joy of a good fight. I just wish they had him in more scenes, along with Jaimie Alexander's warrior goddess Sif who kicks her fair share of ass, holding her own with Thor on the battlefield in the all-too-brief scenes she's in. Kat Dennings as Jane's intern Darcy Lewis again brings perky comic relief, teamed this time with her own hapless and much put-upon sub-intern, Jonathan Howard's Ian, to great effect.<br /><br />On the disappointing side though, Ray Stevenson - an actor whose work I generally love - is once again completely wasted as Volstagg, because the script gives him little to say and even less to do and makes no attempt at all to bring out the character's grand Falstaffian humor. But it's Natalie Portman - an actress again whom I generally love - whose Jane Foster unfortunately creates the biggest drag on the acting side. Aside from the serious problem that the plot renders her a passive pawn for almost the entire film and the script leaves her only banal dialogue to work with, there's simply no chemistry between her and Hemsworth's Thor. None, nada, zip.  Which makes all of Thor's motivation for her being the great love of his existence all seem rather fake and flat. This is made all the more painfully clear by the scenes between Thor and Sif where, if only briefly, you see some real man/woman feeling on display. Hell, even Darcy and Ian, the interns, have more chemistry going than Thor and Jane.<br /><br />There's no real point in trying to explain the plot beyond 'dark elves want to destroy the realms and Thor must stop them to save not only the realms but his one great love'. Partly because it's going to be explained to you from the minute the film starts. And then explained some more by various characters explaining things to each other. And then explained yet some more, in case you somehow missed out on the first three lumps of exposition.  In point of fact, most of the first half of the film consists of characters constantly explaining things. Unfortunately, none of this ends up mattering because no amount of explaining can make any real sense of what's happening in the film, let alone make you care about it. The more they explain, the less you want to hear.  Basically, just think \\"midi-chlorians\\" from Star Wars. Yeah, it's like that.<br /><br />The CGI is fantastic and eye-catching, but after a while you start to feel awash in it, particularly when it starts to get in the way of understanding what's happening. And in the way of seeing more of Tom Hiddleston's Loki. He really is the best thing in the movie, bringing it to full life when he's on the screen and letting it sink back into meaningless tedium when he's not. The man can do more with an ever-so-slight smirk or a wounded puppy-dog look than most actors can do with a full page of Oscar-worthy dialogue.<br /><br />Oneminor thing that I found rather distracting - though it may have been just me - was that the armor and helmets the dark elf foot soldiers were wearing in the big battle scenes seemed way too reminiscent of the look of the Cybermen from the older Doctor Who incarnations.  I kept expecting the Tardis to sudden materialize in the middle of the battle.<br /><br />A couple of final notes. As always, Stan Lee has a cameo you can watch for.  And there are two end-credits scenes to catch, the first particularly intriguing as it not only suggests what might be coming next, it introduces a new character played by a very well-known and talented actor you'll probably recognize.<br /><br />In the end, except for the humorous bits and the chance to see Tom Hiddleston doing Loki once again, not really recommended for anyone but die-hard fans of the first Thor film.minor thing that I found rather distracting - though it may have been just me - was that the armor and helmets the dark elf foot soldiers were wearing in the big battle scenes seemed way too reminiscent of the look of the Cybermen from the older Doctor Who incarnations.

B0057F869U|4.0|Mia Wasikowska is a perfect Jane Eyre.  She has the rather haunted look and can pull off being plain enough to suit the part.  Her acting, as always, is superb.  While Michael Fassbender is a wonderful actor, he is just much too handsome to play the tortured Mr. Rochester.  I did enjoy the eye candy though.  This is definitely one of the better interpretations of the Bronte classic although I'm not sure anyone will ever top the Orson Welles version.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|First off I just want to mention that Amazon is on top of delivery! My copy wasn't supposed to be here until Thursday, but it showed up on Tuesday. Needless to say I fangirled out. Most of the songs on the CD are absolutely awesome! However, there's about two or three songs I don't like. I think it was the song Swine I really liked...only they did something...weird. You'd have to listen to it to see what I mean. All in all I'd call this album a success by musical standards, even is Gaga has kept her strange habit of naming her CD after one of the bland songs (excluding born this way, of course). If your a Gaga groupie, it's a must have!
B00DW36G32|4.0|If you can ignore Travolta's accent in the film you will enjoy it.  The movie was well-written and solidly acted and very suspenseful.  I really enjoyed this film.
B00ER23V1W|5.0|Poignant music that fits this brilliant film so well - got emotional all over again listening to it, especially the sequences that relate to the astronaut's re-entry using the Chinese spacecraft, the touch down into sea, escape from the hatch and feeling normal gravity again under foot - absolutely liberating stuff! Gravity is the greatest space film to rival 2001: A Space Odyssey and a soundtrack to match.

Unfortunately, my willpower was never up to the consistency change of life challenge.  This is something I could see myself doing forever. and it works.

B004TI1WME|3.0|I was going to write a very glowing review of Office Calculator Pro, because it's quite handy and the best calculator I've come across for Android, so far. That is, until yesterday, when I desperately needed a calculator, and was in a complete dead cellular zone. The calculator requires an internet connection... I suppose to validate the license. Without an internet connection, no calculator! I've uninstalled it.
B00APJLY0Q|3.0|Not as funny as it could potentially have been, considering the myriad of characters presented. The central theme of a &#34;young&#34; girl (Dracula's daughter) coming of age and wanting to expand her horizons was old and predictable. It's okay as a time filler for those in the 6 to 10 age bracket.
B00F91H15W|1.0|There was nothing to this film.  It was pointless.  Emma Watson gives a great performance but that is literally the only good thing about the film.  It wasn't that it was badly written, or acted, or shot.  It was just pointless.  Nothing really happened.  Don't waste your time with this film.
0439796644|4.0|I liked the book very much.  I felt the movie was not as good even though the cinematography was very good.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|WORST BOOK EVER WRITTEN!<br /><br />This is seriously the worst book I have ever read, ever!<br /><br />I am not sure what bothered me most. The incredibly stupid plot, the poor dialogue, the use of the term \\"Baby\\" constantly or the unlikeable characters. There is so much to pick from. In all honestly, the Captain Underpants books that my kids read in 1st grade provided higher quality reading than this book.<br /><br />I keep asking myself why I continued to torture myself by going on. I came to 2 conclusions. First, I paid for the book based on a recommendation. Being as cheap as I am, I could not just stop reading something I paid for. The second reason I continued was my belief that it had to get better. One can only assume that since an editor allowed this to be published that it had to have at least one redeeming quality. I was proven wrong. There is nothing good to say about this book.  In addition, I later found out that it was self published.  That would account for the typos, poor grammar and ridiculous plot.<br /><br />It is a pathetic story about a pathetic college couple who prove over and over again to be losers with nothing better to do than fight, drink, gamble and break up. Sadly, I have to report that a sequel has been written from the view point of the boyfriend this time. Considering what a loser he was from the standpoint of the girlfriend, I can only imagine how pathetic he will come across when he tells his side of his fairy tale romance.
B00BT1XCOU|3.0|Its good. Has its moments of solid laughs. You all know as well as I that this wind up is long over due.

B00ADQPB50|5.0|Asylum was extremely addictive.  I love Jessica Lang and she rocked her part as Sister Jude.  After seeing the first episode of this year's, Coven, I was hooked and had to &#34;go back&#34; and see the first two seasons.  A bit of blood and gore but a lot of creepy.  It's very interesting to watch the same actors in different roles.  Incredible story line.  Totally twisted.  Loved it.
B00B4Z5GDQ|3.0|First 2/3 is a documentary about the Sound City Studio and it's legendary clientele and mixing board and is quite interesting, especially if you formed your rock interests in the 70s. Last 1/3 is getting the old musicians back together to record at Dave Grohl's studio with the Neve mixing board, and I found this part quite dull.

B00BEIYN3M|3.0|I had bought this movie off the prior strength of Jason Sudekis's work.  I loved horrible bosses, and really liked Hall Pass.  In general think the man is very funny, and enjoy his work.  To make a long story short watch the trailer for most of the funny parts.  The first 45 minutes was pretty slow.  I laughed hard a couple of times.  I guess I was just hoping for better.  Okay to rent but please do not buy.

Some thing I like about this game isnyou get a sand box were there is no ending just build and have fun! There are races that you can do were you are timed to beat it. This is bad pigies. So worth the money I got it glfor free but then I bought it on my on my dads Ipad so get the game do some mischief on bad piggies!

B0000E6I1J|5.0|This concert was put on for George Harrison after his death.  Many of the people he wrote songs with and recorded songs with show up and put on a fantastic concert.  I'm not into the first 20 minutes of Indian music, but the Rock and Roll portion was enjoyable.  Eric Clapton runs the show and should be congratulated for doing a fine job. NO, GREAT JOB.<br /><br />P.S.  There is also a DVD or Blue Ray  I bought it also.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great  story line.  I couldn't put it down!  would love to read more about these characters. I would definitely read more from this author.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I loved his return to Jake and Ford County.  As always, great story telling and wonderful characters.  Unlike other authors who just develop a plot and hand it off to others to finish and then publish it, Grisham has had his hands on this up to his elbows.<br /><br />I was very sad to finish this because it was that good. But then again, that's why he's so great. I hope we can see another book with Jake and this cast of great characters again in the not so distant future.
B00DPH7Q0W|5.0|Hey it's Pink Floyd, one of the best albums ever. If you are a Floyd fan, probably no new information here. However, it is great to hear how it all came together.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This book was very interesting and full of information in Hitler German times.  It gives information that possibly no one else might not know about those times.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|In short, I loved it.  I considered it a revelation on the ways and means to success.  I have seen the truth of his words in my own life.  I do my best to instill his principles into the minds of my children.  I share his findings with everyone I meet who desires to climb the ladder.  Please, read it and live it (as much as you have opportunity to do so).  If you are the 99 (as I was) and desire to be part of the 1, this book is indispensable.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|At the point in the book where Lucien was sneekjng jnto Ancil's room at night and whispering to him like a dream, I kind of thought it was headed towards a lynching and running the family off but the way John Grisham played it out was perfect. I think the only thing I would've done differently, was to further explain or mention more about why Seth was giving Ozzie money for his campaign and that might further explain the will. And lastly, I do wonder why he never found Lettie or her family any sooner than he did prior to hanging himself from what appears to be the same tree that his father hung Sylvester from. But overall a very good book and will probably read again.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I like it is really fun I am level 5 in only a few minutes. Very good graphics on my kindle.might even spend real money on some upgrades.the review process is quite bothersome though.

B008K6HN8I|5.0|Great unrooted control of your device files. Not super intuitive but good once you learn the ropes. Good for sideloading
B00FHATBGW|1.0|I saw another reviewer noted the issue with the hammer and nail scenes. I had the same problem.  There is a bug with the app on that scene.  At least it happens before you have to unlock and pay to keep playing. I think I'm walking away from this one.
B00C7E3ELE|4.0|I gave four stars as film is excellent & contains earlier extras available from previous dvd (2005) release inc the excellent John Carpenter/Debra Hill commentary which sticks to interesting titbits of info directly about The Fog,which is unlike the new commentary (2013) with Tommy Lee Wallace/Tom Atkins & Adrienne Barbeau which is more rambling,like a friendly chat down pub,much as I love these three people,the documentary would have been a lot more enjoyable with more interesting new info about just The Fog rather than rambles.<br /> Unfortunately the two individual documentaries with Jamie Lee Curtis (talks solely about her career,interesting as this was,I would have preferred more new & direct info about  The Fog.)The Dean Cundey documentary suffers the same problem as Jamie Lee Curtis`s documentary in too much info not about the Fog,the info about Dean Cundey is interesting & very new to me,including posters etc.<br /> Ideally I would have preferred two solo individual documetaries just about say Tom Atkins & John Carpenter.I imagine they weren`t available for filming.<br /> New item was a joint Phantasm/The Fog trailer & it is great too have all the items available in one package.Well done for that Shout Factory.- I would like too see Salems Lot as special edition disc.This Fog dvd is definately worth acquiring as you`ll love film & the new 1080p definition film print makes film twice as large & see things not in original print.Peter
B0063IH60K|1.0|Did not like all the adds. The games was okay, but took a little time to get used to.  I took it off my Kindle

0316322407|5.0|I told a man sitting next to me on the plane the other day that Malala is worth a thousand Korans, and I would venture to say that<br />Mohammad himself, in today's world, would agree.  And so would all the great prophets and teachers.  A woman is not worth half a man, she is worth every bit that any man, powerful or not, comprehends himself to be.  Maybe someday theocratic, fundamentalist men in all their power and glory will carry their own wombs, will impregnate and clone themselves and will have no other need for a woman but to kill and eat her.  And should that new species begin to exist, let's hope it has a small brain and is covered with hair and stays underground where moles, worms, and bacteria flourish and feed the trees that feed the animals who need a greater light to exist.  Religious heirarchies, tremble in peace,  Allah is not male, or female only.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Finally a return to form! I absolutely love this album. It takes EDM music to new dimensions and even mix it with a couple of other genres. I highly recommend this album, it has barely 1-2 fillers, the rest is pure ecstasy. My faves are Gypsy and G.U.Y. I'm all in again, Gaga!
142313866X|5.0|The best collection of it's kind. A beautiful series. The content and printing are excellent. Focus is on the beautiful background painting and detailed preliminary sketch layouts. Many visuals not previously published. A treasure.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|The game is a lot of fun. It seems pretty basic though and not quite as challenging as I hoped.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This games is the best and most funniest. All of my friends play this games to and they think it is fun because you can canect with every one.  I even saw some people on 274 level!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I hate adds.  When I did play this, the adds were annoying and slowed things down.  It's cheap enough to get and avoid adds.
B001U9BRNE|1.0|my blu-ray never played the dvd- then I tried to return it and the website never worked not even for a refund. I tried with other blu-ray players and they did not work either. Make sure to provide functional blu-ray dvds
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|I read the book and the movies turned out to be a great interpretation of that book. I was afraid that since I knew how the story ended that I'd get bored with the movie, but such was not the case. Cruise did a wonderful job with the part and the director made the story come to life. It's definitely one of the best movies I've seen this year.
B000V39KDO|5.0|Molon Labe! The story of the Spartans comes to life in this awesome blu ray. I hadn't bought a blu ray in years ( I've turned into instant streaming guy) but this one is added to the collection.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I am an avid reader and absolutely loved the 1st two books in this series, however, this last book was so disappointing that I wish I never read the series at all. I was so excited to finally read about what was beyond the wall and see how Tris and Tobias ended up. I still can't believe Veronica Roth thought this ending was great...Once I read the whole book I understood why she wrote it in both Tris and Tobias' perspective, but neither of their personalities felt the same as the first two books when reading it and I am literally in denial of the ending. I admit I was hoping for it to be something I could not predict but this was just so depressing..as I was reading it I kept thinking \\"this can't be the ending.\\" As I read further and finished the book I discovered that sadly it was and I was so angry about it...I will not be buy another one of her books again if I am just going to be disappointed and depressed after reading them.
0446556750|4.0|Not as good as The Lincoln Lawyer... however; may have been influenced the the movie. Overall, still a great read.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|These guys are hilarious! Even when Simon Pegg is serious, he's funny. I could watch this over and over and, in fact, I have. The ending is just fabulous! If you like, Shawn of the Dead then you'll like this one. It's a real hoot! Simon plays an Ace cop who's really serious about his job and he's so good that the other cops want him off the force! So they send him to this backwards town with &#34;no crime&#34;. But, of course, Simon has a nose for crime.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|one of the best Christmas albums up to date! Michael Buble has the perfect voice for Christmas songs. Good sound quality and not so expensive.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|The movie was action packed, but also had comic undertones and moral lessons. All in all it was a great movie.
B00F35BV64|1.0|One of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. I couldn't finish watching it. I started to rewatch Alias on Netflix just to remind myself that Abrams isn't actually a completely incompetent storyteller.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the characters, the story line, the era, the way they dress, just everything about it.  Superbly done! Waiting with great anticipation for the new season to begin!
B00DJYJPLO|2.0|\\"Before Midnight\\" is the third and probably last installment of romantic films starring Julia Delpy and Ethan Hawke as lovers Celine and Jesse.  The first film featured the couple as fresh-faced twenty-somethings in \\"Before Sunrise\\" back in 1994.  The subsequent films follow \\"Sunrise's\\" template; extremely talky, low-budget affairs set in picturesque European locales.  The third is set in Greece.  The length of intervals between films permits the viewer to see the actors/characters age and develop over the years.<br /><br />The second film, \\"Before Sunset,\\" established a tragic \\"Affair to Remember\\" type of scenario in which the lovers failed to reunite at the appointed time.  It ended on a hopeful note in which it appeared that - despite other relationships - the couple would finally be together.<br /><br />The theme of the third installment is: \\"Be careful what you wish for.\\"  The promise of the earlier films has turned into poison as the couple struggles with vindictive exes, long-distance parenting, professional and marital dissatisfaction, and suppressed resentments.  The final act of \\"Before Midnight\\" is a long, ugly domestic fight in which Celine and Jesse say countless unforgivable things; the flaws which they were willing to gloss over in the past become ammunition for the nastiest character assassination game since \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.\\"<br /><br />Like its predecessors, \\"Before Midnight\\" has a flat, talky, pseudo-documentary feel that rings true.  The only false note comes at the end of the film; its hopeful tone comes long after the viewer knows that too many hateful things have been said to ever allow a reconciliation.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|hints would be helpful.<br />a hint option would be helpful as some clues were a little vague or confusing. more levels would be good. looking forward to more.
B0029XFN9O|5.0|fun, cute and entertaining! this is the best Christmas movie! for the whole family! 100% recommended! great image quality as well
B007PVHMCG|2.0|A lot of money for such a small box.  I really thought there would be more in there.  The box was about a 6x6 cube.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|A very funny, and very insightful, story about personal growth—the hard way!  Bill Murray is so great in the embittered slacker role he plays so well.
0525425772|4.0|I didn't realize it was a young person's book.  However, it was interesting and I would definitely recommend for young people.
B0026QC0TA|5.0|This is a Great movie, John Grisham is my favorite author. I would like to see more of his books become movies.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|I ordered this as a gift and it was just opened this past week and it doesn't work. We tried it in several cars but it will not charge the phone. I had ordered another one that worked just fine so I am not sure why this one doesn't work but I am not happy about it.

0307594165|4.0|Toni Morrison's books always deliver, as she covers sensitive racial topics and periods of history with clarity and feeling, all the while telling a good story.
1594202273|5.0|I clicked five stars because of the incredible information in the book, although the way the author jumps around in his time-line (not just in the Damascus accident, but throughout the book), it's sometimes hard to keep events in correct order.  It's almost like Schlosser thought the facts themselves weren't &#34;good enough&#34;, and he had to jazz the story up a bit to make up for that; if he ever does a second edition, I would hope that he just puts everything into a strict timeline.  But as to content, the book is about just how hard it is to corral the stockpiling and control of nuclear weapons so that there aren't explosions—and the lesson you get from this book is that it's almost impossible to believe that we haven't actually had an unintended nuclear detonation so far!  For there have been so many accidents that could have led to an explosion that the odds against us continuing to be lucky must be growing and growing!
B00EVW04PE|4.0|Surprisingly good. A predictable movie but very entertaining.  Good action scenes. I would recommend it to others. Jamtie is an excellent enough actor not to have be a comedian in this.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|item broke 1 month after purchase. spits out dirt and finally cracked. absolute piece of garbage. great idea...very poor quality and execution.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It was a fun movie to watch. Good acting and story line. Although I haven't read any of the books, I was still able to enjoy the movie.
B005SCSL56|5.0|My daughter's teacher is reading this book in class and she loves this book so much that we are about to buy it!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|one of the best, attention grabbers I've ever read. always something fresh around the corner. I'm itching to read on!
0316010669|1.0|Couldn't even finish the book.  Just seems trivial in its analysis.  In even the first chapter, the &#34;intuitionists&#34; are in fact extremely artistically trained, whereas the scientists weren't, so how much intuition was actually proven?
B0055SWM08|5.0|Would be a little better if you could &quot;undo&quot; last move without having to start from beginning each time you make a wrong move, especially when you get into the more difficult puzzles.
B000KRNCYY|2.0|i bought this CD because I like irish music but for me, this wasn't peppy enough, though I enjoyed the harmony voices.
0920668372|5.0|I love the book! I could not stop crying after I read it for the first time. My daughter and I were singing the song to each other. So sweet.
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|It's hard to start when describing this movie's stupidity. Of course there is the typical Hollywood bias - hint, the terrorist might not be radical Muslims. But I expected that going into the movie. It is just one dumb thing another: the president wearing Air Jordan's and a suit, the 'hero' calling one of the attackers 'Bitch' during a fight, the stupid jokes in the middle of gun fights - it was endless!!!<br /><br />You expect some far-fetched things with a movie like this - this was just stupid! Just for the record, I did see Olympus Has Fallen. That was far-fetched too but 10x better.<br /><br />You've been warned: YOU'LL NEVER GET THESE TWO HOURS BACK!
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie, not all that familiar with the original Star Trek story but it seems that this franchise is becoming something I will look forward to as they continue it.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Awesome! Story lines are always unique even though the formula isn't. Love this show! Stana is gorgeous. What more do you need?
B00FLNRN06|4.0|Strong cast with good performances by everybody.  Laughed several times. Even though story is a bit predictable, it moved along at a quick pace and the acting was very good.
B0017IKR7K|5.0|This was the very first country artist I listened too and the song that hooked me was Tics.  I've been a country fan ever since of Brad Paisley and all the southern country cowboys.  I've even converted by I've converted my Southern sista to country music.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|I don't understand why everyone hates this movie so much. I thought it was good. I've seen much, much worse movies. I would rate it about 6.75 - 7.25 out of 10. So 3.3 - 3.6 on Amazon. Not a great movie, but not a bad movie either. Good acting, great scenery, great visual effects, great story line. I really like the whole overcoming fear motif. Pretty awesome theme. DEFINITELY worth renting. As a comparison, somehow Snakes on a Plane, Sharknado, Casshern, and Death to Smoochy all scored higher. 4 movies I turned off without finishing because they are so horrible. I rarely turn off a movie without finishing. I give it a 5/5 because I want to bring up the score. Again, DEFINITELY WORTH RENTING.
B003M70O5O|5.0|This show rocks in every way--the writing, the acting, the action.  This show predates &#34;Breaking Bad&#34;, but is just as good.  There's even a character who starts out &#34;good&#34;, but circumstances bring out her bad side...and that's great!!  Watch it!!
B002VPE1Z2|5.0|100% recomendado
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book series is among the best I've ever read. Getting this eBook collection was one of the best investments i've made and shed so much light on why the movie was good. While I don't like how the first book and movie didn't totally sync up, i understand how one must take some creative rework to fit production budgets. However, having seen both, the movie was true to the story and I expect the up coming movies will do the same. I would recommend this series to anyone.
B00BATG18K|1.0|The main characters, Lulu and Violet seem to suffer from the same poor character development by Tan.  When Tan sends Lulu back to the US, it's almost as if she forgot what the character was all about emotionally and spiritually.  She never really dealt with the theft of Lulu's baby son by his Chinese father, nor did she address it later on.  Perhaps she is going to let Lulu find the child in a sequel.  It was almost like Tan just forgot it as a plot development along the way.  She used it as a device to send Lulu back to the US to search for him but once there, it never came up again....No mother could ever forget the loss of her child and would go to the ends of the earth to find him.  The same situation repeated itself with the theft of Violet's child later on<br />but at least it got resolved though not in a believable way.  So many things just seemed like plot contrivances and even Lulu's reasons for<br />becoming a madam really failed the honesty test in my opinion.  For a smart young woman, Lulu made a lot of serious mistakes in trusting people and being able to separate fantasy, wishful thinking and truth from each other.<br /><br />I think that Lisa See has dealt with similar situations in a much more effective manner in some of her earlier works.  I think that many of<br />the descriptions of how a high class courtesan is \\"educated\\" became just too much and was better done in Memoirs of a Geisha.  This book was just not a winner in any way.  Sorry I wasted time and money on this one.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I'd never heard of orphan trains but when I did my interest was sparked.  This book is an intricate tale of two young women, both orphans, spanning almost 100 years.  It is very well written, combining their separate histories and journeys and bringing them together seamlessly.  I am fascinated with this part of our American history that is so little known.  It's piqued my interest to read more on the subject and also to read more by this very talented author.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|It's very convenient I have access to all my files anywhere everywhere. On my computer on my iPad or iPhone
B004DMAZQK|5.0|This is my favorite album by this group. The While Lies had put out two albums prior to this, &#34;Death&#34; and &#34;To lose my life&#34;. This album is a progression from those two. The sound 'evolves' on this album and becomes much more robust. The vocals / lyrics on this album are my favorite to date.<br /><br />There is a lot of heart/soul/the-feels in this album if you take the time to listen to it. At the same time, this is a rock group that can stand up to criticism. If you compare some of the technical elements to modern rock groups you'll see that they are using a lot of good techniques (to the layman 'they play well together!') plus they use advanced techniques, some of which I really like in bands like RUSH and Led Zeppelin.<br /><br />Let me put it to you this way, I'm sending all their albums to my Pops who is 69 this year. He's a big &#34;Rock and Roll&#34; guy with an open mind for new music that might be as good as what he's already heard. Looking for a gift for a certain music enthusiast? Here ya go.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|A true classic. The evil man who learns from the good of other people and turns around his way of being. Sorry for my bad english.
B008JFUOVI|5.0|LOVE this series of movies. The characters are all great and I laughed the entire time. I've watched it several times already.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive and fun! Challenging enough to keep my interest, but relaxed enough to let me slip in too my happy alpha wave zone. The only concern I have is whether keeping with the free version as. I get into the higher levels will be possible - but even then, I've already had more than 99 cents worth of fun with it so I really couldn't complain about either.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I loooooooooooove this show!!!  It had me totally addicted until I ran out of them to watch.  Nothing else is satisfying me now.  I love the intrigue, the plot shifts, the cleverness, the characters...
B00EY8A6BC|2.0|I love to disagree with the critics, but with this movie I can't. While the movie was action packed, the storyline was predictable and the resolution was unsatisfying.
B001LV5OOY|5.0|This is the White Lies first full length CD, and it's quite good. I bought this album when it came out, having heard their single &#34;DEATH&#34; on a college radio show. These guys turned out to be the real deal and this album is full of that. If you pick up Death, This Album, RITUAL (My Personal Favorite, every. damn. track.), and then Big TV. Rip them all to your PC then listen to all of them in order<br />you<br />will<br />be<br />rewarded<br />with a wonderful musical experience. This band has a lot of soul/heart/in-the-feels-ness/stuff that you look for in a proper rock band. These guys are just a Drums, Bass, Guitar/Singer set. Super Simple, but they can produce some great sounds. They also use really good techniques. I some times compare their music to that of RUSH or Led Zeppelin.<br /><br />TL:DR This album alone has a lot of good tracks. I would recommend it for a gift to a rock and roll fan in your life.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Lady G's new album, ARTPOP, is chock full of interesting surprises. Some tracks in particular that I like is Venus, G.U.Y., and ARTPOP the single. I like the simple beats at the beginning that lead to a cascade of sounds. Nobody sounds like her, and there are people like Madonna, Britney, Miley who may try to copy GaGa, but they fall short. GaGa is unique, and so is her ARTPOP. I have no idea why there are so many ugly people out there who try to tear her apart. I bought Lady G's new album, and I highly recommend it for everybody who wants to hear avant guard music. I LUV ARTPOP! (slaps thigh) Ignore the negative people. Lady G took all 15 tracks, and nailed them to THA WALL!

B00B52F278|5.0|After watching season one and two, and the mini season, Spartacus: War of the Dammed is the perfect conclusion to an already amazing show. Once you begin watching, you soon become involved with the storyline and the actors. Sparacus: War of the Dammed has some amazing battle scenes and a heart-stopping storyline.

B00634GHJA|3.0|It is a bit hard to use when you don't want to set up a program on a PC to receive the photos.  Somewhat redundant if you use Dropbox - which automatically can sync photos between an adroid phone and a PC in either direction.
B00BOXZAJ8|5.0|This is a verry strange sci-fi story and what one will do for love. At the start of the movie you my feel a little lost but don't give up, it all starts to pull together.

B008JFUPK8|5.0|tl;dr: Man of Steel is a gorgeous action-packed yet serious work of comic book cinema that everyone should watch. It may not be what everyone wants from Superman, but it is really well-done and worth seeing no mater what.<br /><br />Long Review:<br /><br />Man of Steel continues the Nolan Batman tradition of combining both serious dramatic story-telling with spectacular action and suspense. Snyder and Nolan are trying to do for Superman what Batman Begins and The Dark Knight did for Batman. As a result, the bar is much higher than for most other comic book movies. Whereas Marvel's comic book films are much lighter and can get by on humor, charismatic leads, and spectacle, DC has opted for much weightier story-telling, grounding its characters in a world that feels more like our own. This is not to knock Marvel as I think their cinematic universe is a lot of fun. Still, I am glad to see that DC is not trying to just copy their formula, and instead they are attempting a more mature and dark tone. Variety is the spice of life and I can appreciate both styles for what they are.<br /><br />The script is quite good though far from perfect. At a high level I think the story arc was solid. We see Superman's origin and a very well fleshed-out Krypton. Zod was really well-written and acted too. He was a complete person and not just a villain. There are some details I didn't care for, but they are mostly nitpicks. Though I am glad they got away from the bumbling and goofy Clark Kent, I wish they had done more to make his secret identity seem secure (it is implausible that the government does not know who Superman is at the end of the film) and explain why the glasses work as a disguise (just to shut up that complaint for good). There are other details of the film's second act that I wish were different, particularly the destruction of Metropolis and the fight with Zod. One thing I liked about Superman Returns is that there was an emphasis on showing Superman saving humans. Hewasn't an action hero - he was a guardian angel. Man of Steel could have used some of that. The destruction was a bit excessive given the light note the film tried to end on and I think the fight with Zod would have been improved had Superman been saving people (bracing collapsing buildings, containing explosions, etc.) throughout. These issues certainly don't ruin the film, though I see them as missed opportunities.<br /><br />The story is not for everyone. Man of Steel does not pander nearly as much as Superman Returns, nor is it apologetic about its subject matter and theme. There is a lot of death and destruction and while I sympathize with people who wanted more levity and inspiration, I think the horror of the struggle with Zod is important to the film's theme. The Avengers featured a comparable amount of destruction but the film's tone muted our sense of tragedy as characters were too busy making jokes and smashing Loki around. Man of Steel does not shy away from the implications of powerful villains bent on terrorizing us (much like the Nolan Batman films). That kind of pathos is not what everyone wants from a comic book movie, but for me, it makes it all the more unforgettable. While the Avengers was a fun popcorn movie, Man of Steel was both exciting and haunting. Its story will stay with me much longer.<br /><br />Man of Steel is, I believe, just the reinvention Superman needed, as the film is both gripping Sci-Fi and an excellent character piece on an exceptional individual. It is exceptionally directed and acted with the best effects I've ever seen in a comic book movie. It's production value is spectacular as is the art style and photography. Every moment has an epic feel and look. Put simply, Man of Steel is superb.<br /><br />It is both the Superman movie we deserve and the one we need right now.

B009UX2YAC|3.0|I think its really fun and its adicting to see how far u can get and if u can beat your previous score
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|This whole albums ROCKS! If you like Stryper or if you've never heard them and like heavy metal BUY IT! I haven't stopped listening to it since I got it. Best album I've heard in years. It IS truly a MASTERPIECE!! I haven't been this excited about an album since Queensryche - Operation Mindcrime came out, nor have I used the word masterpiece to describe an album since. I have 10 out of 12 favorites but I listen to the whole album when I play it, because EVERY song is KILLER, and their version of \\"Jesus Is Just Alright\\" is not to be missed! It's been years since I've even purchase a CD so I'm happy to say it was WELL WORTH my money. Love it!! I plan on buying 2 more copies as Christmas gifts for friends.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|Admittedly I was initially put off by the subject matter of JoJo Moyes' newest book.  A quadriplegic love story?  End of life issues?  Down on her luck country girl thrust into a caregiver role?  Forget all of it--Me Before You is the best book I've read in a long, long time. The main characters, Will and Louisa, are interesting, complex individuals both wrestling with a number limitations: physical, economical and emotional.  It's a powerful love story, rife with everything but sex but full of a deeper kind of romance. Will and Lou \\"dance\\" in his wheelchair, he murmurs in her ear to \\"move closer--you smell so good.\\"  Sexier than 50 Shades!<br />Run, please, to read this lovely book.  You will not be sorry...
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Bought this for my wife and she loves it.  Came with an MP3 download as well so I didn't have to rip the CD to our laptop and other devices.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Book was awesome. One of the best of I've ever read. I love this entire series!  This book is a must read!
086547897X|5.0|It's a testament to an instruction book when even people from outside its relevent field find it useful!<br /><br />I ended my foray in cartoon animation a couple of years ago to focus more on comics, this book being a gift from someone at that time. I still pick it up today!(and I have heaps of books and seldom bother writing reviews). Aspiring animators will take great value from the old-school method of keyframe-planning that the book advocates, other artists will love the simplified diagrams of running/active figures - an imperitive in an industry where there is never enough time to finish a project. But so many other books on drawing neglect to teach the figure in motion, and how to exaggerate it for artistic purposes, and this one has it in spades! The lessons on perspective are also ones that I still use.<br /><br />Some critics have alluded to the absence of realistic figures in favour of the family-friendly bug-eyed carton type. To be honest, I noticed this at first but after 5 minutes of reading the book I didn't find it a problem at all. The drawing systems can be applicable to anyone and his writing is fantastic, about as good as I have ever seen in an instruction book for artists. Richard Williams brings his own personal experiences, valuable little life lessons from his career that might seem superfluous to some but are motivating and offer many clues to the aspiring professional! I even enjoy his decision to go for an entirely hand-written text font, to emphasise that the pencil-on-paper should ALWAYS come before any flashy computer effects work. A brilliant middle-finger salute to an industry now sadly saturated by digital-effects wizards who turn away audiences with their disorienting hack skills. This book is about timeless fundamentals. Big and expensive, but highly recommended.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Its a story about love, the emotional ups & downs that make up what love really is. It was not a story about lust disguising itself as love.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book. It was very suspenseful. The writer is brilliant in capturing the audience's attention throughout the book.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I don't even remember buying this but I'm sure it's good. No need to write a negative review over something I've don't even remember buying :)
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Well written. Each season gets better. Family and employment stories well blended. Watching season 3 and intend to continue to view all seasons online until I am up to date with current episodes on tv/cable!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|My son loves this game. I was playing and now the entire family loves to play this game. It's great for long trips in the car
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book and getting to follow familiar characters. Definitely recommend to any fans of his work.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|This item was purchased as a gift request and the person who requested it loved it.  It was a great hit.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|it just would not work every time from our toshiba laptop.<br /><br />Apple products and my Friend's adroid phone it works fine.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I don't want to give away any of the story line because the uncertainty of not knowing who knew what was one of the most intriguing things about the book.  The characters were well defined and a reader could relate to their personalities and character traits.  This book was very hard to put down and I read until I finished the story.  And the story stayed with you which I think indicates how well the author told the story.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I really liked the first two books. This book however was incredibly difficult to get through because I was bored out of my mind. It was too slow, too preachy, and scattered. There were all these things going on, but I felt like nothing was happening. It became one big sermon about racism and abilism. Too much story, not enough action.
0553106635|4.0|An amazing read.  I'm midway through and I am captivated.  Storytelling at it's finest.  A must have for any fantasy genre reader.
B005PK553C|5.0|Can't believe this show is not on a paid network like HBO or ShowTime. Very well done show with high production value. It's not a cheap thriller like some movies you would see in this category. Awesome camera angles and great stories intertwined into a fantastic series. Can't wait to start season 2!
B008JFUPK8|2.0|the quality in blu ray is horrible, waste of money, should have just gotten the dvd, the movie itself is ok, a little tiring at first.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|I saw my brother playing this game on his kindle fire, so I decided to get it for mine. After numerous attempts to play the game it just wont play. It loads to the main screen perfectly fine, but as soon as I hit play, the game tries to load and just redirects me to my home screen. I have tried to erase the game and download it again multiple times and it just does the same thing every time. Also when I download it, it takes a long time or it just will not download. My brother plays it perfectly fine every time he starts it up.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love it. Got my husband in the drama too. Can't wait till next season. We can't watch it without each other or we'd feel like we were cheating on each other.
B005HE5J7I|5.0|This is a great book. The plot escorts you through the history of London and Britain from the stone ages to the end of the 20th century. A great story we'll presented. I have now read of the Author's books but London remains my favorite. Worth reading multiple times to soak in all the details.
B00DHHFKE4|5.0|Very well written, drawing you into the reality of prison life for women from different walks of life. Well worth reading, I could not put it down
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This book is well worth reading. It is moving and disturbing at the same time. To have \\"death\\" be the narrator was so different. The telling of the story would not have been the same if one of the main characters told the story. Can't wait to see the movie. I hope it does the book justice.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This book is really more a collection of stories that I found more frustrating than anything.  I craved more stories from Afghanistan and life during occupation.  However, if you stick with it, some things do tie together.  Although, you may need to take notes or a character map while you're reading to keep up. Also, this is one book that I found difficult to read on a Kindle because of all the jumping back and forth in time.  I couldn't just dog ear a page and flip back to remind myself of what year I was in. I honestly think that would have made for a better reading experience.<br /><br />Some of the characters are endearing and others are not.  As usual, Hosseini reminds us that not every human will do the right thing and that true humanitarianism and heroism are rare. Do not expect to feel satisfied with the ending - it lacks a finality that was needed after all the jumping around.  I have really enjoyed his other books, so I'm glad that I read this, but I certainly wouldn't add it to my &#34;must read again&#34; list.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's very challenging......almost frustrating at times..but it is a lot of fun and entertaining and a great distraction from<br />real life.&#34;....
B004SBULWE|1.0|For the Kindle Fire HD this is one horrible app. it slows the Fire down to barely a crawl and cause it to act like a paper weight.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Great movie, I know bad pun. This is another great film in Del Toro's IMDB page. The 3-D effects are great, not too much. I really enjoyed this in the theater and to add to my collection. This is the best of my childhood - giant mecha, awesome monsters and the battles between the two.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|Cos I love this movie. Best &#34;silent&#34; movie I have ever seen. Raymond Briggs did a wonderful job. They used to show it on TV every Christmas in England. Don't know if they still do.
B00G32TD98|5.0|This movie really gave us &#34;the creeps&#34;.  There hasn't been a movie in long time that has done that to us.  Good cast and well done.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the second time that I am reading this book and of anything it is even better! I would recommend it to anyone.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Don't let the heading fool you, it may be a Judi Dench movie, but this is one hell of an enjoyable movie to watch.<br /><br />So why do I call it the Judi Dench movie? Well, it's mainly about M and Bond just happens to be a part of it.<br /><br />The general theme of this movie is that M, M16, and Bond himself are being outclassed by a more modern and sophisticated enemy. Rather than have someone who can infiltrate and shoot the crap out of bad guys, they need operatives who can hack computers and stop digital terrorists from taking over.<br /><br />Okay, what's great and what's not so great about this movie? Let's go:<br /><br />GREAT:<br /><br />- Action scenes are absolutely fun to watch.<br />- The one-liners are great.<br />- We get to see a bit of Bond's origins.<br />- There's a lot of character development for Bond and M.<br />- The final battle scene ties up the movie nicely and is oh so fitting for the theme of the film.<br />- Well acted, and Judi Dench is a pleasure to see in action.<br /><br />The -not- so great:<br /><br />- The villain was said to be a \\"brilliant\\" agent. But he does nothing to show why he's brilliant, except being able to hack and plan things. I was expecting him to at least show off some martial arts skills or incredible marksmanship. NOPE!<br />- Why do director's insist on putting bad wigs on Javier Bardem?<br />- I didn't really understand why something in the villains mouth could change his facial appearance. They make no reference as to what it is or even try to explain it.<br />- The final confrontation with the villain is VERY anticlimactic.<br />- The characterization of the villain felt inconsistent. One moment he's ready to kill M, in the next, well... you'll see for yourself at the end of the movie.<br />- The way Javier Bardem portrayed the villain, made him seem rather weak. Just everything about him felt feeble, like he could easily be bested. This is inconsistent with everyone saying how this guy was the most bad ass agent that ever lived.<br />- Bond Women, were under used. Probably could have done the whole movie without them, which is a shame.<br />- Q didn't give any cool gadgets! Come on!<br /><br />I know there's a lot of negatives on this list, but really this was a great movie that had great action and humor sprinkled in all the right places.gent that ever lived.<br />- Bond Women, were under used.

B00881VLCE|5.0|I just started this app but so far I enjoy the different levels of difficulty. I have 3 kids and the last time I tried to put an actual jigsaw puzzle together my 3 year old destroyed it. I like that if I have to stop it saves my progress automatically. So far, it is great, we shall see if it makes me purchase puzzles when I run out of the free ones.
B008V8FVTI|5.0|Great story. You will find yourself rooting for the characters involved and wondering if there could be a &#34;happy ending&#34;.<br />All star cast. So well done!  Grab the popcorn and enjoy!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Judi Dench brings it!  The cast of this movie are just terrific.  I watched it several times and each time enjoyed it even more.<br />Realistic life portrayed for seniors and aging adults.  Presented with taste, compassion and well written for the screen.  Truly depicts real circumstances facing retired individuals, their decisions & choices faced.  I highly recommend this movie for entertainment.
B008JFUO72|4.0|Superhero movies are making a HUGE comeback and have continued to rack up dollars at the box office for the past couple years.  You can thank Sam Raimi and Christopher Nolan for revamping our interest in the genre.  With `Iron Man' making a giant splash with critics and audiences in 2008, it was only a matter of time before Robert Downey Jr. became a franchise all his own (since he IS Iron Man), and now in 2013 his name is synonymous with big budget Hollywood franchises.  In fact, if Daniel Craig hadn't snagged the role back in 2006, I'm sure Robert Downey Jr. would have jumped at the chance to be a superhero, a sleuth AND a spy.<br /><br />But, back to `Iron Man'.<br /><br />The reviews and reception of `Iron Man 2' was dismal (and deservedly, since outside of Scarlett Johansson's hotness, the film was a mess) and so they really needed `The Avengers' to be a hit, and it was, to the point that `Iron Man 3' became one of the most anticipated films for all boys over the age of two and under the age of dead.<br /><br />I'm late to this party.  I missed it while it was in the theaters and so I had to wait until Redbox would let me rent it, and even then I waited a few weeks for some reason unknown to myself.  I finally wrapped my eyes around this visual spectacle last night, and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  I will say this as preface; I really, really loved the first `Iron Man'.  I hated the second one.  I found `The Avengers' to be, quite easily, the most overrated movie of 2012.  I liked it, but my god was it pimped out to be the second coming of superhero movies, and in a year where Nolan closes out the most impressive trilogy in superhero history, you have to do better than that.  It was fun, but rather messy, cluttered and underwhelming.<br /><br />I know that I'm in the minority.<br /><br />`Iron Man 3' takes place after the events that happened in `The Avengers', so if you haven't seen `The Avengers' you're going to be about as confused as my wife was while watching this last night and seeing Tony Stark have spastic panic attacks when someone mentions the word `alien' or `wormhole'.  So Stark is going through his thing, but the world is going through something else.  Explosions are taking lives and some creepy man of questionable (and ambiguous) ethnic decent is taking over the airwaves to make threats and take credit for destruction.  He calls himself Mandarin, and the world is in a state of panic because of him.  Stark is sidetracked, but then things get personal and Tony has to man up, grab the machine by the wires and MAKE.PEOPLE.PAY!<br /><br />Shane Black does a really nice job of keeping the action the center of attention, and the action is worth noting since it is done so well.  The action starts relatively quickly, and it remains steady throughout the film's two hour, ten minute running length.  I'll be the first to point out that the final fight sequence between Stark and his real rival is WAY TOO LONG, but it's still entertaining.  These scenes are glossy and sharp and upgrade the series previous installments, showing growth and not just a lot of the same (the underwater sequence is remarkable).<br /><br />Another thing that `Iron Man 3' gets very right is the balance of humor and realism.  The film has its stark dramatic core and yet Downey Jr. is so easy and effortless in his role that he exudes such natural charm and his humor is spot on.  The dialog between Stark and Hogan and Rhodes are littered with sharp jabs and a lot of fun.<br /><br />And let's just say that Ben Kingsley is amazing here for SO MANY reasons.<br /><br />I never followed the comics, so I can't voice in on the treatment of Mandarin, but I do understand that fans have mixed emotions about it here.  I thought it was brilliant, but that's mostly because Kingsley handles it so well.  The rest of the cast is fine, but nothing remarkable.  Hall is wasting her career, Pearce is too obvious, Cheadle has become so boring and Favreau has so little to do, but Paltrow is great and Badge Dale is effective.<br /><br />It's a tad long, the last act is drug out too much and the finale feels like a `Dark Knight Rises' rip off, but the film is far more focused than `The Avengers' and Downey Jr. was really born for this (a far better fit for him than that of Sherlock Holmes), and those effects are jaw dropping.au has so little to do, but Paltrow is great and Badge Dale is effective.<br /><br />It's a tad long, the last act is drug out too much and the finale feels like a `Dark Knight Rises' rip off, but the film is far more focused than `The Avengers' and Downey Jr. was really born for this (a far better fit for him than that of Sherlock Holmes), and those effects are jaw dropping.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman does it again with a thought provoking and beautifully lyrical novel. He interweaves the modern day world with magic in a unique style all his own. Well worth the read.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I love fantasy books and this one takes the cake. The only thing I wasn't particularly fond of was all the gory details of the ripping and slaying that happened in the book, but I'll get over that!
B00632HWOG|4.0|Easy to navigate. I am sure there are a few things that could be tweeked but overall it's very easy to use.
B0014LRQOW|5.0|This recording is so beautiful you will want to put down what you're doing and just listen.  I'm not going to give you a bunch of musician mumbo jumbo, even though I am one.  The music on this disc will paint a picture with every song and I don't need to describe it.  You will hear it with every part of the orchestra and every turn of the musician page.  It is breathtaking and you will want to listen over and over again.  If you don't necessarily listen to classical music, but want to give it a try, then I would highly recommend you start here.  All ages will devour this recording.  Absolutely love, love, love it!
B000OCXIDK|5.0|I didn't think I would like this book, (had to read it for a class) but it is a beautifully written story. Totally plausable fictional account of Vermeer's inspiration for his most famous painting. However you can skip the movie version, its terrible.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I hadn't heard of this book but read it for my book club. The overall style and subject matter reminded me of a Jodi Picoult novel. Loved the narrator's (the father) insights into his feelings.

B00G91WB3S|5.0|I seen this movie three or four times, Henry Cavill does look like Christopher Reeve in this movie.  This movie is an all star cast, with Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne, Diane Lane, Michael Shannon, Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner.  Henry Cavill is the third british actor to play an american superhero, Superman. We had Christian Bale to play Batman he was my favorite, we also have Andrew Garfield to play Spider-man these two guys were my favorite actors to play two top american superheroes that I always admired.  No offense to Henry Cavill, he is good not good enough to play superman, because I miss Brandon Routh he was the perfect fit to play superman.  I rather have him to play superman in this movie, instead of him.  No offense, but I really enjoy this movie, it has an excellent plot, great character and great action.  I have to give Amy Adams full credit for this movie, she did a great job playing Lois Lane.  So does, the rest of the actors who plays in the superman franchise.  I also like the music in this movie, it was really amazing.  One thing I also respect in this movie, it was a lot different than the superman movie with christopher reeve.  Where Clark Kent travels to the artic to find the fortress of solitude and starts his kryptonian training.  But here it shows Clark traveling around the world, saving people and catching bad guys as an anyomus superhero before he heads to the fortress of solitude.  Lois Lane meets Clark Kent for the first time, before he became superman and knows his identity a lot faster than a few years.  It reminds me of Smallville Lois Lane meeting Clark Kent without the glasses before he became Superman.  That's the reason, why Amy Adams made an extraordinary performance in this movie.  This is an excellent movie that was box office gold, I can't wait for the sequel to start.

B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Denzel is fantastic, as usual.  The first part of the movie is &#34;on the edge of your seat&#34; great!  Then the next half deals with real life and just when you think......well, you'll just have to find out.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It had some humor and I was ready for a lighter read. I wasn't a fan of the ending, but it wasn't too bad, just not what I would have preferred for the conclusion. I would recommend this book.

B006R4H5FG|5.0|This is a great resource to have.  Presentation Zen is an amazing reference tool.  Anyone who creates and delivers presentations should read this book.  It is easy to understand and implement the principles immediately.  If you want to make powerful and impactful presentation you should read this book before you start.  It will allow you to focus on what's important, the audience and will save you time and frustration.

One of the first ones, other than One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest that I remember Jack Nicholson appears in.  Combine that with Peter Fonda and Dennis Hooper (deceased) you have an excellent movie.

0321704452|5.0|This is another great book from Garr Reynolds that will allow you to clearly understand how to deliver powerful and memorable presentations with or without slides.  As presenters we have a responsibility to the audience to be relevant.  Naked presenter allows you to focus on the why of the presentation and not rely on technology to be the presentation.  He explains that people are not inspired to act on reason alone.  We need to make an emotional connection with the audience.  The key to unite an idea with an emotion is best done through a story.  This book goes to the core of the presentation not just focusing on eye contact and content.  It is a must read for anyone who has to give a presentation, I will give the book to my teams.

B00EI2Y4MQ|4.0|I have installed two calculator apps: a scientific one that I keep for the rare occasions that I need the extra features it provides, and a basic one that I use frequently for daily arithmetic calculations (tally up expenses, split the bill, etc.) This falls into the latter category, and I will compare it with the similar Calculator Plus (CP hereafter) which has gained a lot of exposure.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- both provides a backspace key which works as it should; however, CP does NOT support in-place editing so, if you'd entered 122456 instead of 123456, you have to keep pressing the backspace key & erase all the digits from the point of the mistake, but with this app you can use the arrow key to move to where you made the mistake & just change it.<br />- both sport large keys for fat fingers. While CP might argue its keys are bigger, the ones on this are large enough for me, and I don't think less space between the keys make it less aesthetically pleasing; but then it's really very subjective if you want to argue about the looks of an app...<br />- both handle the % key in an intuitive way, so you just enter 100+15% to get the correct result of 115<br />- CP allows you copy a previous expression from its history, this app lets you copy either an expression (using the top left history key) or a previous answer (using the answer history key). If you want to redo a previous expression with modification, you should copy it from history and edit this \\"new\\" one instead of directly editing the *completed* one shown in the history; otherwise you will see what seems to be a wrong answer in the history because you had modified a RECORD!<br />- this calculator has the 00 key, CP does not<br />- CP has only one main display line, this one has three fully-visible ones and - since it uses a smaller font - more digits will fit on each line; so, if you regularly have to work with a whole bunch of numbers, or long ones, this app would be more suitable<br /><br />Cons:<br />- both only support ONE memory value<br />- CP provides the pi, square, and simple fraction functions, this one doesn't. (Although I can't remember the last time I have need for them.)<br />- both does NOT let you store constants for reuse. This app lets you store ONE default tax rate for use with its two tax buttons but, for me, one value is inadequate as there are different taxes with different rates!<br />- both does NOT let you specify the number of decimal places to display and, naturally, nor any rounding methods.<br />- neither supports skins or themes; this one offers different background colours but that's all the cosmetic changes you could make.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think this calculator is a capable alternative to the much-hyped Calculator Plus, except that its regular price is twice as high! I don't think it's worth that amount of difference but, since it's a FAoTD, install it today & forget about buying either of them!<br /><br />[Added] You have to wonder whether some reviewers are just plain dumb, or have an agenda, because they seem to be parroting the so-called \\"square root error\\" which is simply not true. If you press the √ key it will automatically add an opening parenthesis for you just like the Google calculator: √( . You can then enter a number, but you can also enter an expression like √(2x2x4 and it will give you the correct answer of 4. If you do not enter a closing parenthesis it will assume you want to add it to the end of the expression, so √(2x√(2 is evaluated as √(2x√(2)) and it will not give you 2! You should have entered a closing parenthesis like √(2)x√(2 and that will give you the correct answer of 2 - again just like how Google do it! In addition, those reviewers say how editing a previous expression leaves an inaccurate result in history; well, the history is there for your *reference* (and for copying)! It's a *historical*record* ffs!! You should copy the previous expression, and make changes to it for a *new*expression; not modify the history! My goodness, do these folks actually *use* a calculator? BTW, the AC and C keys in glaring pink work just as expected. The AC will clear the entire screen, while the C key will remove the last value or operator. There's a free version of this calculator (which I haven't tested but I assume is the same), so if  anyone is confused by the conflicting reviews try it out and see for yourself!expression; not modify the history!

B00000K3D4|4.0|I had seen this is one as a kid and wanted my kids to see it. They loved it, They werer glued to the screen until it went off. So that tells you that old movies can still attract the newer of generations.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|love this series. Great service too.  Adding this other line because Amazon is requiring it. there is no other reason to have this line.

B00BPDR3F6|3.0|I'd rate this 3.5 stars.<br /><br />Alma Whittaker is a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />Born in 1800 to Henry Whittaker, the English son of a poor gardener who, through every trick in the book, transformed himself into the richest man in Philadelphia, and his blunt, intelligent wife, Beatrix, Alma learned at a very young age that she had the world at her disposal. Encouraged to never stop learning, and questioning everything around her, she was more than able to hold her own in conversations with scientific experts before reaching adulthood. Inspired by her father's successes in botany, Alma throws herself into studying the flora around her voraciously.<br /><br />But as she grows into adulthood, Alma realizes she wants more out of life than knowledge. While she enjoys the passion that comes from intellectual pursuits and spirited conversation, she also dreams of the passion of romance and sexual fulfillment. But hearing far too many times from childhood that she is \\"the homely one,\\" she comes to the conclusion that those dreams may never be a reality for her, so she focuses solely on her studies, her science, and helping to manage her father's estate, while dealing with romantic disappointments.<br /><br />And then in her early 50s, she meets Ambrose Pike, a talented biological lithographer whose paintings of orchids are unlike anything Alma has ever seen. She immediately feels a connection with Ambrose--they are connected by a thirst for knowledge and a passion for nature. Yet while Alma has always focused on the scientific, Ambrose's beliefs lie in more spiritual, magical, and divine areas, which challenges everything she has ever believed and known. But she finds herself falling passionately in love with him.<br /><br />\\"There is only so long that a person can keep her enthusiasms locked away within her heart before she longs to share it with a fellow soul, and Alma had many decades of thoughts much overdue for sharing.\\"<br /><br />Elizabeth Gilbert's TheSignature of All Things is meticulously researched and tremendously detailed. It spans from Henry Whittaker's voyages as a young boy all over the world to Alma's travels as a much older woman. The book takes you to Tahiti, the Netherlands, Chile, Argentina, England, and many other places, and introduces characters as wide and varied as scientific experts, Tahitian natives, missionaries, sailors, and abolitionists. Alma is a fantastically intriguing character. Her presence is tremendously felt throughout the book--this is a woman whose mind is always working, always seeking, and yet it is her heart that gives her trouble.<br /><br />While this book has a great deal of charm, and Elizabeth Gilbert is an exceptional storyteller, I just didn't love it. The story at its core was fascinating and intriguing, yet the more detail Gilbert packed in about science and religion, the less it appealed to me. It felt a bit like gilding the lily--Gilbert used five, ten, fifteen pages to make a point when I got her point in only one. It took me longer to read this book than I expected because it is very cerebral, although it does have a lot of heart along with its head.<br /><br />\\"She knew that the world was plainly divided into those who fought an unrelenting battle to live, and those who surrendered and died. This was a simple fact. This fact was not merely true about the lives of human beings; it was also true of every living entity on the planet, from the largest creation down to the humblest.\\"
B00000JPH6|4.0|Watched this as a kid and wanted my kids to see it. I don't think they liked it too much, or maybe they were frightened. But I enjoyed seeing it again.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|I thought this was one of PC's best. I didn't want to put it down. After all these years she is still so good at writing books with great stories.
031623480X|5.0|Absolutely the best information,well documented,wish I would have read this 60 years ago! With my medical background I was astounded!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is awesome for the kids!  They love it!<br />Makes them take care of the horse daily. And has them glued for hours.
B00G8P27PM|5.0|This is a great prequel. Our 2 year old and 4 year old have enjoyed it more than the original. I love being able to buy the Blu-ray pack that includes the Amazon digital version.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|Loved it. This is just a great series, hope that they continue it. I loved the plot of the story, it was totally different from the first one. But it was great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just love this game. I love how every level adds something different and challenging. Love it...love love love love it
0385350864|3.0|I loved the first Bridget Jones book and thought the second one had some clever parts.  This one was definitely lacking.  Certain sections really dragged on and the storyline certainly isn't how we envisioned Bridget to end up.  Depressing with a tidy conclusion that didn't mesh with the rest of the book.
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|While it is free, like any other free multiplayer you can spend money to rush buildings and get supplies. However, if you don't wish to spend money you can still do everything, you just have to be willing to wait for your building upgrades. While you can be attacked everything rebuilds itself upon next login, so no having to rebuild for hours things you've already built - that's nice. If you like building up cities/armies and destroying random people's cities/armies with Team Fortress-esque graphics then this is your game.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Steven Spielberg did it once again.  I really enjoyed this movie. He always seems to pick the right movies to make.
B00G722T22|5.0|Avril really hit a homerun with her fifth album. Catchy hooks and tunes abound, and her vocals are some of her best ever. Out of all the recent releases by some of the top female pop stars, this is the one I can't stop playing!
B009AMANBA|5.0|Excellent cast of actors all portrayed their parts so well.  This was one of our favorite movies, my husband watches it so often I think he can recite the lines by memory.
B008QE9BS4|5.0|Superb music. McLaughlin continues to push the envelope. Dazzling. Exquisite. Each time I listen to it, I find new levels of complexity and beauty.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun for all ages, it's addictive! Love  winning a level and moving on to the next level. Just make sure to stop in time to get some sleep.
B00AYB0YFQ|1.0|This installment of the Scary Movie Series was really bad in my opinion.  It was not as good as the first four movies.
0767919408|5.0|Bryson has no contemporary rival in his ability first to compile relevant, and fascinating, information, and then to present it in a logical and readable fashion.  This is a first-class book in every respect.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Great documentary, I became hooked after catching it on cable T.V. and just had to purchase the set.  It's so true to what happened during WWII, even my father loves the set I gave him.
B00CSV7AFC|5.0|This album is so creative and imaginative! Every song contributes different levels to the story of the album! Half Moon Run is a unique talent and should be known by all! I hope they continue to make and share music with the world!
0812548094|5.0|This is one of the best epic fantasy series I have ever read.  From the first book to the last Terry Goodkind had me wishing I could read faster to find out what happens next.  I highly recommend the Sword of Truth Series to anyone.
0440246016|5.0|love JR, Lee Child is an amazing writer, has a stellar editor and frankly I'd love to see hbo or showtime DO a Jack Reacher series. More riveting than the Sopranos (and I loved that series), and probably a cheaper shoot, too.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I used to love this series when I was younger. I can't believe it was only on for three seasons! What a treat to go down memory lane. I even saw some I do not remember seeing before. Quite a handsome package as well.
B007EC27QM|4.0|Love it, looks like a giant calculator on my nexus 10 and buttons are huge! Just perfect for my parents. The only problem I'm having would be having the rotation-lock locked in portrait mode while launching this application. It will simply launch the app in landscape mode and locked in landscape mode. I have to disable rotation-lockto run this app
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone ages 13 and up. The message of Thirteen Reasons Why is something everyone should hear about. After reading this book, I have changed how I view other people. Most people my age (I am a junior in high school) are very quick to judge others. After reading Thirteen Reasons Why, I have tried to cut down the amount that I judge. This book has taught me the impact of rumors, and has further backed up the idea that you never know someone's background story.<br /><br />In Thirteen Reasons Why we read about Hannah's thoughts, but we also read how Clay reacts to those thoughts. You get to see the two sides to Hannah's story. Hannah Baker is the main character of this book. Clay, who was also a main character, had a crush on Hannah but was never able to tell her and now will never be able to. Before Hannah committed suicide she recorded seven tapes about 13 people who caused her to commit suicide. She sent them to the first person, they had to listen to the tapes, and then send them to the next person. Clay received the tapes, but what did he do? Was he one of the reasons she committed suicide? He will have to listen to the tapes to find out.<br /><br />Overall, this book was well written and had a truly inspiring message to go with it. Thirteen Reasons Why leaves you with the idea that we need to take more time to understand the people we interact with everyday. The book teaches every reader that even small things can have a large impact on someone else's life.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It has a lot of glitches but if it got fix it would beter  the glitches make it super slow that's what I hate about it
B00902AKK4|1.0|Downloaded to kindle fire HD.  This game looked fun and promising...any time I would try opening it it would crash.  Sometimes it would even freeze my kindle or even turn it off!
B00BEIYM42|4.0|Story was a real tear jerker, but the directing could have been better. Overall, I would recommend it, but not a good as it could have been.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I own the cassette, but could not play it in my car. The price was right. Another Brooklyn girl makes good.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|outstanding for the road warrior field service engineer! this is my second pack and only reason i replaced is the other one after 5 years started looking a bit ratty but all zippers and everything still was serviceable.<br /><br />tons of storage, i love this bag! gave my older one to a newb tech and he loves it.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Sucks<br />Ladies not give you enough information in groups. Try again. I'll<br />Uninstall it. Perfectly useless app very very disappointed
B006LXQID8|5.0|Truly an original film. Audrey Tatou is perfect as Amelie, a girl who has just had real life pass her by. It is in French and subtitled. If you know any French, the movie shows more if its tongue in cheek goodness. It is one of those films that is a great pick-me-up and can be watched again and again. Highly recommended.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|Total waste of time. Don't waste your time to watch it ...and my upset I paid $3.99 for it! to rent!
B00124FQCK|2.0|The sound quality is so bad that it's almost not worth listening to.  Bass far to high and guitar far to low.  This sounds like a lot of other bands back in the 70s and 80s.  I'm not a Dio fan, but even his stuff sounds better than this.  I was inspired by some of the good reviews, but this is just not what I would consider Black Sabbath material.
B00A2H9OZS|5.0|(Review of theatrical movie only)  If you like the Riddick movies, then you may find this the best of the series.  It does a great job bringing the best elements of Pitch Black and Chronicles of Riddick together, and telling a fun story of survival.  It's well produced, and the dialogue is fantastic.  My favorite of the series, which I really did not expect.  Highly recommended for Diesel and Riddick fans, and recommended in general for fans of gritty sci-fi.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is amazing that you can now have double chests and you slow down when your eating food the neather is the best part
B008Y212PI|4.0|The only issue I have was the difficulty/confusion of the directions for someone younger.  After figuring out how to play and teaching my niece, we both enjoy this app!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I love Tom Clancy novels. They are always so technically sound and that combined with the storylines are just amazing reading. I can never put them down.
B00D2ZF24O|3.0|Slow starting, interesting viewin; not easy to follow; but, overall theme worth viewing. I watched it twice to make certain I had not missed something in the story line . . . I re-commended it
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fantastic acting, beautiful sets and scenery. It's a nice change from the shows you normally see on tv. Because its an hour, you have a chance to get engrossed in the story line and characters.
0316055433|1.0|Hoped to find in \\"Goldfinch\\" the creative quality I enjoyed in Tartt's previous work.  Gave up less than fifty pages in.  The book rests heavily on stereotypical constructs such as the all-bad, absent father, thereby forsaking opportunities to create for us characters blended from subtle and conflicted ingredients.  It spends all of its creative capital obsessing over descriptive details of setting that fail to move the story along or to offer an original perspective on any significant human theme.  After a couple of chapters I did not buy into the improbable actions of the main character nor care about their consequences.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Wasn't sure I was going to like this book.  Big surprise, I really loved it.  It gives insight into how some people live in India.  So many opposites.  Good story.  Really made me appreciate how we live here.  Family is very important there, which is nice to see.  Very well written.  Nice read.
B000KKPN5C|3.0|This flash is definitely an improvement over the one that's built into the camera, but I'd buy the SB 600 or 800 if I had this to do over again. I shoot a lot of wide-angle shots, and this doesn't sit high enough above the camera body, so I have a tendency to get dark, half-moon areas in my shots where the lens blocks the flash.<br /><br />Also, the SB 600 or 800 can tilt in ways the 400 cannot, so your bounce flash options are very limited with the 400.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Greatest Superhero movie of all time.  Special effects are absolutely mindblowing and acting is great, Henry Cavill is amazing as Superman.  The dvd transfer is extremely well done.  Get it
B003L77G6A|5.0|Who doesn't love this show?! The characters are amazing! I always &#34;laugh out loud&#34; when I watch TBBT. Great deal on Amazon, as always!
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|wow what a great movie ~ moving from the time it starts to the end ~ I watch it over and over ~ well written, well acted, just good entertainment
B008Q08IV4|5.0|One of the best all times movies. It doesn't matter how many times it is watched, it always feels like the first time. Laugh, cry and get inspired.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|A wonderful love story and a very creative ending. This one can make you  believe that true love never fails!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It would be an excellent selection for a book club discussion. I questioned myself on what I would do in similar circumstances.
0071422943|5.0|Perry's Handbook in invaluable to chemical engineers.  The 8th edition has provided excellent updates on subjects that were lagging behind the times in the previous editions.
B0036S4C6G|1.0|I don't often not finish reading a book once started, but I did with this one. Maybe it was the subject of the book. I didn't find the lives of the characters very interesting. Possibly a generation gap for me. I'm 80.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is almost as famous as angry birds in my school in MN GO ROCKETS<br />Don't. forget to stop bullying. I know that was random but I get it behind my back by a bunch of mean girls
B00E34A9FU|5.0|I could feel the vibes like I was there! Wish I had been. Cd's were excellent quality and music was as good as it gets. Even getting to see a lot of Merry Pranksters on DVD! Awesome.
B0019IB0II|3.0|it really helped me deal with my grandsons traumatic brain injury and how to encourage him to keep fighting back.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|I totally avoided this program when it was playing on ABC.  Now I am addicted.  The acting is great, the stars are lovely to look at and the story line is brilliant.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|This is one of the most intelligently written shows on television.  Love the cast, the story lines and the attention to detail that take the storytelling to the next level.
B0001BS4Q0|5.0|This girl can't miss. She's minted the art of pure presence. Add to that her unique and unquestionable vocal talent.
B00G725UZA|5.0|David Bowie still delivers fine music. I've been following his career since it started, and it still astounds me how he still puts out such quality music.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good story, good acting,Diverse actors, a lot of adventure. i can't think of anything else to say and am in a
B007URVZJ6|4.0|The title sums up the content of this book. It was very helpful in clearly laying out the steps needed to upload your own book for Kindle. And it was free. Win-win situation.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|i love this cd. the sound is amazing . maybe i can see them in concert someday . i reccomend this cd.
B0014XCMVM|2.0|Lyrically it is pretty good but the music is weak and unfocused. There's just no vision to be found here.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|It really needs alot of space but whatever it was a good game and it takes long but that's the only ups and down mainly down for me for now
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Awesome, The King is still the King! Excellent job of keeping the reader captivated! Never a dull moment in this novel -
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|it is a great one to have if you like the Beatles good music and New is New great sounds
B0058VW36U|4.0|My kids and I really enjoy this game. It passes the time and is challenging enough to keep the kids entertained. There are several levels that we redo over because we don't get it right the first time. It's a simple game yet makes you think outside the box on how to. Try it!
B00002N9ER|4.0|HOLDS A MAGLITE SECURELY.  NOTE TO THE PENNY PINCHERS:  UNLESS YOU NEED TO HOLD THE FLASHLIGHT VERY TIGHT, LIKE IN A 4WD VEHICLE, YOU CAN USE ONE INSTEAD OF 2.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|It is a very confusing game but it is also very fun. I think this would be a good game for anyone.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I loved this read and how concentrated I felt while reading it. Greenie's journey is awesome because it's as unknown to him as it is to the reader and so you get to share in his travels right along with him. I can definitely see how this is a series. You really do want to go further with it and it makes me want to read more about it! The Maze runner is one of those books that has longevity...when you are done reading it, it sticks with you and in your mind. Loved it!
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Love her! Got it, and it's a great album. Been waiting two years for it! She is just such a perfection queen!
B002QVBP5U|4.0|I'm going to just step up and say that I like this album even though it is not his best but certainly has some good moments. The nice musical arrangements make up for mediocre lyricism although it doesn't have the &#34;jump&#34; factor as &#34;Room for Squares&#34; and &#34;Heavier Things&#34;. His newer country orientated releases don't quite do it for me though. This vinyl version issued by Sony trumps the CD by a significant margin, which is often the case with this particular genre of music. A bit harder to find than the more recently issued Music on Vinyl version, but do try if you're a fan.
B00G91WB3S|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS THE BEST RENDITION OF THE SUPERMAN SAGA. THE ACTOR WHO PLAYS THE MAN OF STEEL IS ABSOLUTELY FINE THE THE INFINITE DEGREE. HE MAKES ALL THE OTHER SUPERMAN ACTORS PALE IN COMPARISON. I LOVED THIS MOVIE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO FOLLOWING THIS ACTOR IN EVERY MAN OF STEEL ADVENTURE.
B004AUGJS8|5.0|I thought this was a great movie! I'd ndvr heard of it before finding it here. I recommend it for sure :)
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|A masterpiece. If you like Carcass, or metal in general, and you do not have it - WTF are you thinking?
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Lady gaga's new album ARTPOP is simply amazing. Each song is unique and unlike any other pop song out there. I personally believe this is her best album yet. it goes from sexy to sweet, emotional, daring etc etc. you will dance and rock out to this album for hours. I absolutely love  it! &#34;G.U.Y&#34; (Girl under you) is a dance song that will get you going!!  along with Sexxx Dreams. &#34;Gypsy&#34; is a song that you can relate too that would be perfect for driving. Artpop is so unique its like poetry but captivating. and Fashion! is one of those songs that you cant help but beat your head too and listen to when your getting ready. there are so many other songs on here that you will fall in love with. I have been playing it and friends will ask me who is that? and when i tell them lady gaga they are amazed! and they actually want to buy the CD. I 100% think that this would be a album to buy and rock out too. ENJOY! because i know you will.
B000MTOMCQ|4.0|This is a good version of HH's first album on Blue Note. Good arrangements and players add to a great introduction for a musical career that has spanned and survived for four decades. This one is a &#34;hit&#34; and not a &#34;miss&#34;. The production has been outdone by a more recent issue on a double 180 gram vinyl version that is simply stunning in comparison.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|great stylus, really, really like it.. design, function, everything is top notch and it is so much fun to use.<br /><br />only thing I don't like (and really is not a huge deal), a little bit of black rubber rubs off on my finger each time I use it. just the way I hold it/use it, so if I didn't notice it, it could be weird to be dirty by a lil tool like that
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun you should have your kids play this game more often like when you traveling somewhere.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I love it you should get it if you don't want any tricks....it really help you to practice the piano
B0089LOG02|5.0|A part of our American history that I was not aware of.  Enjoyed authors way of weaving the  charaters into the novel.<br />Would like to have known is Molly ever searched for her birth mother.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Really fun but entirely too addictive! I also don't like paying for extra turns and special candies, so patience is a virtue.
B00005JLD4|5.0|Good movie and told a lot about Australia that I didn't know.<br />The movie moved along very nice.<br />The subject was covered well.<br />The photography was excellent.<br />I would view this movie again.
B007UXTG8M|4.0|Definitely well worth the money spent! It will keep you guessing throughout the movie. The entire cast was fantastic. Wow!
B0015UKX7Y|5.0|Awesome. Arrived in good condition and i love it! I have been on an Alex Turner kick so I decided to add this to my collection.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is cool and neat it has different features  I would know I'm a horse lover rider but there are plenty games that are better like deer Hunter 2014
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|Various gameplay modes for each level makes you wanna play again and again.  The visibilty of the objects and the contrast are great.
B005ES0Y0Y|4.0|I am 9 months pregnant and I am schedule for a repeat C-section and I needed shoes to wear home from the hospital that would fit my poor swollen feet. I wore them with my first baby and these were the only shoes I could get on my feet due to post feet swelling!
B002NT3B52|1.0|It was not what I expected.  Instead of warm and fuzzy it was dry and technical.  Way too scientific for my tastes.
B000VUCIZO|5.0|Great read! Nice little piece of the history that changed all of our lives. Well-written and a joy to read.
B0081336FO|5.0|Just like the first season, but better! Suspenseful, exhilirating, and all-around stunning. Great acting with a witty, modern interpretation of the classic detective.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I read this book almost nonstop of two days. So beautiful and inspirational. Jurek has a lot to offer in a short book.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Works at some point. It's so slow you need to tap 'wait' for the app several times before it comes up. It's too painful to use. Find better programmers. It's only a weather app. There are better alternatives. Fail.
B00B5D32XS|5.0|Gripping, horrifying, redemptive.  It is difficult to over praise this season.<br /><br />The writers show genius in their ability to deconstruct and recombine horror genres into a coherent story arc. The season features an intelligent melange of the following &#34;traditional&#34; horror themes: dehumanizing mental asylum, Frankenstein themes and human experimentation, alien abduction, demonic possession, serial killer, and nazi war criminals/hunters. I may be leaving some out. All of that is blended into a story arc that fully resolves by the end of the season, and most impressive, makes you care about characters that you begin the season by hating. I actually had tears in my eyes watching the bittersweet endings for favorite characters.<br /><br />Kudos too for the actors who switched roles so convincingly from season 1. What a gifted cast.  It was a special treat to see how each actor changed so profoundly into their new character's personality.  Some of these characters are destined to be ones I will remember for years. Season 2 is twice as good as season 1.
B00FMF3R0I|5.0|The 1994 release of these recordings were poor but these are fab. Crank it up and enjoy the raw young Beatles! live!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|A lot of fun very addicting!!! Keeps you entertained the whole time. Game keeps changing so it's exciting and sometimes frustrating in a good way
0316776963|5.0|This book is so funny.  I love the writing style of David Sedaris and I can't wait to read another one of his book.
B005PK57IK|5.0|The writing is superb with big story arcs.  The acting is great too.  I usually don't care much for Chris Noth, but think he did a fine job in this series.  Juliana Marguiles (sp?) gives an incredible performance as a woman piecing her life back together after a major betrayal by her husband of fifteen years and the ensuing public scandal.  Supporting roles are equally well-acted..  The office intrigue is realistic, as is the general insanity of the law as a profession.
B00992CF6W|5.0|coolest game ever you sould buy it you will be glad. buy it today messing I do not have the game I wish it was free
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I LOVEEEE THIS MOVIE! I couldn't stop laughing! I can't wait to see the second one. It has action, a funny romance, and of course the funny crazy guy we all love! (:
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great character development, terrific acting and good interaction between the characters.  Just as soon as you get fairly comfortable, they throw in a big change.  Outstanding and never boring.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I went through this series like a hot knife through butter.  The story is so compelling I continued to watch episodes even when I had to start paying for them, something I've never done with any other series on Amazon Prime Video.
B00EI4V3X2|4.0|I was looking to upgrade and get ready for the ps4 and since these were the only surround sound headphones out at the time i decided to go ahead and get em. I previously had turtle beach x31's which weren't awful, but having to change batteries time and time again was a pain. That's why i like the px4's, you can use them and charge them at the same time. The extra charge cord is kinda of annoying but a solid trade off in terms of having to use batteries. The sound sounds about the same as the x31's, maybe a little bit sharper. The chat volume is extremely high on these so it's easy to hear people. Easy set on 360 hope it's the same on ps4. 4 out of 5 stars.
B00DL2W7Q4|4.0|Many good stories, anecdotes well written but the main storyline itself is not so strong. I got a feeling of a heap of interesting stories. Mr Gladwell's way of telling his &#34;real life&#34; stories is unparalleled.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app every night to plan my daughter's outfit for the following day.  I love the hour by hour feature! In the morning I judge which coat to send her to school with based on the times she would be outside...and I can plan ahead for my own lunch - will I stay in or go out...?
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Mr. Gaiman does us all a great favor and peels back the cover of the world just a smidge and let us all get a peak at what may dwell behind it all. Thrilling and horrifying at the same time he shows us the world is a dangerous place even if you are only 7 years old.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|The book is a quick, informative read. I finished it in an afternoon. For a person who rebels against restriction, this way of eating works very well for me. I've been doing the 2 fast days per week for over a month and haven't slipped up once. I've never been able to stick to any other &#34;diet&#34; from more than a week in the past. And I'm actually losing weight this time.
0761172726|5.0|Love this calendar and have been using the brand for years! Unlike other mom planning calendars, this one has 5 columns at the top of each month that you customize to each family member. This means that you only need to write down the family's names once per month. Other calendars have you re-write the names every week, which I find tedious. The columns make the calendar extremely easy to read and follow. A huge selection of event stickers helps you see commitments easily and from a distance. I'd be lost without this (and so would my family)!
B00BSZZA3I|3.0|It's not a perfect solution, but it's okay. The case is a little bulky but somehow still flimsy feeling. It makes using the phone much more difficult. It IS good for keeping your phone dry and protected, but just doesn't feel like it'll last very long.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|Their best album by far.  I am not as fond of the later ones and love the nice touch of rock.  The harmony is great!
B0083Z3O8Y|2.0|This is a story of Jane Fairfax, as seen (or rather not seen) through the eyes of Emma.<br /><br />Emma is a clueless, snobby, and judgmental person. She presumes herself above other humans and tries to decide their lives, forgetting herself human too; the game turns on the player.<br /><br />The beginning is engaging until Mr. Elton section comes to an end. After that, Emma is removed from the center of action, and becomes a passive observer on the sidelines, and not a very sharp one at that.<br /><br />The ending is undeservingly happy. Every smallest thing that could cause anyone vexation is smoothed away by the author's solicitous hand.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Fun fun fun!!! Love it!!!!! I've told everybody about it, found it online first, then just had to have it for my kindle!
B005721W9O|5.0|Amazing - clever, witty, and an all-star cast. I love it. I'm still hoping for a sequel to this one!
B00EI2Y4MQ|5.0|I haven't used the app extensively yet, but so far it looks really good.  not only can you see each element as you put it in, but you can recall previous calculations and edit them!
B005GIS1WA|2.0|My son will watch nearly anything at 4.5 years old - this one he was so bored - asked me to shut it off after 20 minutes.
0767903811|5.0|I have read many Bill Bryson books, this one ranks well among all of his works.  We discovered him while living in London; he had 2 books on their top 10 ranking at the time.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|I'm a simple person and I like simple things. Fried Green Tomatoes (set in Alabama in the 1920s, 1930s and 1980s) is right up my simple street despite others seeing complications where I seem to see mere simplicity. To my simple mind, the film is just as good as the book (by Fannie Flagg) if not better (though I advise reading the book as well). The plot itself is complicated and one needs to watch the film several times in order to 'get' it. But that's a major advantage for every time one watches the film one sees more and more - the sadness, the joy, the period charm, great characters and great character acting, hilarious moments that morph into marvellously moving scenes as well as surprises upon surprises. I first watched this film several years ago and am regretful that I haven't written a review of it before today. Well, having watched it again today, here's some catching up and I simply want to award it ten stars but Amazon won't let me. Therefore, this ten-star film gets Amazon's simple best - a mere five stars.  I cannot recommend it highly enough: it's very close to being the greatest film of all time. Get it now and watch it time after time: you'll be like me and never tire of simple perfection.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|This movie is another one that should be in a personal DVD library. A funny movie with a good moral to it.
B00F2362IE|4.0|My son enjoys this app a lot easy for him at 4 years old. The show is my favorite on Nickelodeon! No Baxter. No 5 star rating. Sorry!
B00EPFEZJI|4.0|UPDATED REVIEW 11/19/2013:  The reviews by others here are pretty good.  It's an average Joan Jett album. I recommend you buy it if you are a fan.  It's better than anything in the top 40 right now.<br /><br />Here's the warning.  I also bought the vinyl version.  As advertised by amazon states this:<br />\\" -Limited Edition LP includes download code to access all tracks, plus 4 additional tracks: I Know What I Know, Seriously, Different (Demo Version), Any Weather (Blackhearts).\\"<br /><br />There is a download code on a paper slip to [...] with the vinyl copy but the link is tricky.<br /><br />When you type in the link for the download...please insure that you use only LOWER-CASE letters.  If you use any upper case characters the link fails.<br /><br />Once you do the link you will get to a private section of the blackheart site and given an option to download a Zip File with the full album and the four bonus tracks noted above.<br /><br />It's all worth it.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Fantastic it was thrilling scary and emotional all at the same time. Highly recommended to anyone who love being scared
B0007KS7D0|5.0|If you are looking for an add-on lens to increase magnification for macro photos, this one is very high quality.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This is a fun movie to watch. It's another great film from marvel and the actors are just great for this movie
B004ODLUGM|5.0|We rented this from the library and we are all captivated (currently watching as I'm reviewing). The animation is stunning and quite clever. I've never read the book but the story us very entertaining. My 3 year old son and girls ages 6 7 and 10 are all enjoying. If you like scholastic books on DVD you will love this. I'm so pleased we found it at our library.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|Alan Jackson didn't disappoint by finally doing a bluegrass album. Great musicians complemented his vocal talents. Recommend it to any C&W or bluegrass fan.
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|If you are looking for an add-on lens to increase magnification for macro photos, this one is very high quality.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|If your intention is to use Youtube, Netflix, Web sites it's ok! But the ridiculous is: you can not show videos or photos from your pc/notebook/tablet. So modern ...so backwards.....
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Boss, even though you have to pay for everything, it's a very fun and enjoyable game five stars if you ask me
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a fun game. I got this to play with my daughter and it was challenging enough to get her thinking but not so toughvthat she wanted to quit.
B001IFZL50|4.0|Full of great characterizations with a compelling script and solid story-telling.  Action and intrigue in ample measure and even manages to surprise.
B002KJX4IE|5.0|This is one of those movies that aged well, remember watching it as a kid, was funny and scary at the same time, watch it recently with a 12 Years old newbie and she loved it, I discovered jokes I didn't understand as a kid, rent it!
B00F30S0Y0|4.0|Honestly every time I listen to this album my opinion changes. Some times I am astounded that I never discovered a great song before, other times I switch it off really annoyed at how bad it is. Upon many listens, I have come to the conclusion I really like it, with some reservations.<br /><br />There are two total clunkers for me--\\"Porno\\" and the last song. Skip over them each time. Just find them annoying and tedious and grating on the ear.<br /><br />There are several songs I feel have very passable, verging on great and very enjoyable tunes, that are marred by insufferable lyrics: that would be \\"We Exist,\\" \\"Flashbulb Eyes\\" and \\"Normal Person.\\" It takes a lot for lyrics to annoy me. I honestly find these get in the way of me enjoying the song. I would love to hear the music but I can't stand hearing \\"What if a camera really do take your soul?\\" again. That is just how it is with these songs. Of course, the music is good enought that I listen anyway.<br /><br />The rest of the album is awesome. Very different from prev. albums, but that doesn't bother me. I like dance/work out music and this works fine for me. It's all very sexy!<br /><br />I listent to it many times before realizing how much I liked \\"Awful Sound.\\" Now it is my second favorite. Definately many things to discover on this album. Maybe the other songs will get better, I don't know.<br /><br />I would definately recommend this.
B006TKP2B2|3.0|I wasn't able to really get into it....perhaps it was just a little too farfetched for me to get to the basic story.  I have put it aside for the time being - and perhaps at a later date I will try again.
B004TACMZ8|5.0|It works very well, detect the PVC water tube under tile and concrete. Though it just show the tubes as studs.
006202406X|1.0|The first book in the series was excellent.  Tris presented as a well-developed character, the plot was solid and gripping.  The second book was okay, it advanced the plot some and was overall satisfying.  After all, you expect the 2nd book to be filler, progression of story, etc.  If you're excited to know what happens in the 3rd book as I was, don't read it.  The plot line is just silly.  I don't see how it fit in with the other two books at all.  Really, this is all the author could think up?  The characters don't progress at all (however much the author wants you to believe that was her focus).  The dialog and interpersonal situations are all things you've read in the previous 2 books, nothing new there and it becomes dull due to the repetition.  Then my biggest complaint (not the ending!) was the point of view alternating between Tris and Four.  She wrote the two characters so similarly and the two characters have been together the previous 2 books so have had all the same experiences that without the chapter headers you wouldn't even know who was narrating.  What happened to the great Tris from the first book?  I guess she got stuck in a bad plot and then...(well everyone should know by now what happens).  I suspect the author put in Four's perspective so she could have him end the book.  I really wasn't even interested in reading his last chapters, but after putting time in the series, I persevered.  What a disappointment.  Perhaps she was up to her deadline, but I don't understand why her editor and the numerous people who read this before publication didn't send her back to the drawing board.ne well, and it's a really beautiful story.  I may give Veronica Roth another try, after all, if I could read and enjoy the Host after the horror that was Twilight there may be hope for her too.
078322740X|5.0|Love, love, love this film so much that I purchased this copy for a friend.<br />Very funny film, have watched it numerous times! Lots of laughter
B00GD9F59S|5.0|So full of twists and turns I Cried the last 30 minutes of theologies from sadness then from happiness....I'm a fan of Greek mythology and female hero's and of course eye candy men and this series has it all a beautiful tale with many lessons learned..
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I'm not a HUGE Lady Gaga fan, I appreciate her, but I'm not as, erm, passionate as her other fans. Her album The Fame Monster is considered her best work to date by many, including myself, but this gem just ups the ante even more. This is definitely much more avant-garde than her previous works. A lot of the lyrics are wacky, and the production on many of the EDM songs are just off the wall. You can tell she's not taking herself as seriously here as she was with her previous venture, Born This Way, and that's probably a good thing. BTW was kind of an overproduced, bloated mess while ARTPOP is the prettier older sister. Gypsy, Swine, and MANiCURE are some of my favorites, but it's hard to pick a favorite since almost all of these songs are perfect! I give this album 10/10!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this and how it helps me figure out things.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Keeps my babies entertained while I work on house<br />stuff. This game is sometimes even addicting for me. I find myself playing after bed time. Teaches my kids some responsibility
B000001FSU|5.0|An old classic. Brought back MANY memories. I had forgotten about this album for many years. Glad I found it again
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This final book was amazing. Some suspicions were confirmed though there were some surprises. Full if emotions... the ending was sad. Great series...Veronica Roth had me captivated the whole time.
B00000255G|5.0|Most superstars of music have a peak.  This is Bruce's.  I like &#34;The Wild, The Innocent, & The E Street Shuffle&#34; better myself but this is without doubt the better record and easier to access.  This is the real source of the huge fame that followed.  Rock music is rarely any better than this.  Not just great songs (all of them here), but a great listen-thru as a whole record.  Even non Bruce fans should be able to dig this.  Iconic.
B000GWE44U|1.0|This is one of the most boring and idiotically dull movies that I've ever seen. I was just waiting for it to be over. It took forever.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I thought this game was going to be plain but I was wrong what's not fun about this game!!!! I could play it all day if I had the time. What's not fun about. racing with your Penguin?
B008MM9630|5.0|Thumbs up! Great game to play when your bored with nothing to do or waiting for a docs app! I love it!
B000002OX7|5.0|The original album has always been The Who's best (by far).  The extras are cool as well (especially naked eye & pure & easy both of which should have been on the original.  The B-side song is a keeper.  Some of the other extra songs are sub-par.  The booklet is interesting.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|I &#34;read&#34; this book a few weeks ago.  I don't remember what it was about.  I only remember being glad that I had only wasted $3.99 on it.
1934030198|5.0|It is very good. Fully understandable with many details and examples for each sport. Perfect tool for coaches and athletes.
