B00005RYKU|3.0|there was more they could have done with it.  This had the makings of a decent horror/suspense flick but it suffered from an underdeveloped plot.  The basic storyline was good, but they took too much time explaining some things and not enough on other more important details.<br />Two children are left orphaned and their new &quot;parents&quot; aren't what they seem to be.  As the movie unfolds, some parts play out pretty predictably, while others come as a complete surprise.  It is the latter that make this movie as good as it is.  The acting is pretty average, but all in all you could do worse than spending a couple of hours on this.  Fairly entertaining.
B000002AEN|5.0|This cd, which represents the complete 1928 recordings of Mississippi John Hurt is truly blues everlasting.  It is amazing to realize when listening to this that it was recorded that long ago.  The quality of the songs, John Hurt's voice and his guitar playing skill are all superb.<br />As other's have mentioned John Hurt was born in 1892, and developed notoriety for his skills as a musician.  He was recorded in 1928 and then vanished into the farmlands of Mississippi.  With the resurgence of folk and blues music in the early 1960's many so-called lost artists were \\"rediscovered.\\"  Mississippi John Hurt was among these musicians.  Rediscovered by a young blues enthusiast Tom Hoskins, who took a clue from a line in one of Hurt's songs \\"Avalon's my home, always on my mind\\" to track him down. From that time until his death in 1966 Hurt became a fixture on the folk circuit.<br />It really is not surprising that he was so well received in the 60's when one looks at this cd which represents Mississippi John's early work.  It includes many truly classic songs, Frankie, Stack O'Lee, Candy Man, Spike Driver Blues and Nobody's Dirty Business. Lines such as \\"he was a bad man, cruel Stack o' Lee.\\" \\"He was her man and he done her wrong\\" \\"angels laid him away,\\" \\"You're so heavy make a good man change his mind\\" and \\"take this hammer, carry it to the captain\\" demonstrate the richness of both the folk tradition and Hurts music.  Artists such as Jerry Garcia, Arlo Guthrie, Taj Mahal and Jesse Colin Young have felt compelled to perform his songs.<br />His voice is pure, sweet and pleasing. While it does not carry the angst of such early performers as Charley Patton and Robert Johnson, it's honesty is copied by others.  His guitar playing is amazing and this alone could carry the cd.  Artist who have been influenced by his style are Bob Dylan, Taj Mahal, Bonnie Raitt, Rory Block, Alvin Youngblood Hart and Sonny Landreth.<br />For those who are interested in folk, blues, the history of modern music or any of the artists mentioned this is a worthwhile cd to have.f modern music or any of the artists mentioned this is a worthwhile cd to have.
B00003CXI1|5.0|...complain about the cutting up of the book and definately the first time i saw it (opening night, hell yeah!) it was like woah wait where are they but the second time it made more sense and when the dvd comes out i expect it to make more and more sense with every viewing. Emma Watson definately was the best actor in the whole group, she was mad good. Harry was alright too but Ron well he's Ron i guess i shouldn't have expected much. But the storyline makes up for any flaws any actor would have. They could have cast Tom Cruise as Harry and the story would have still worked alright. This is a great movie and with the promise of more storyline with deleted scenes it should be pretty insane. Check this movie out now.
B00005JKED|3.0|The movie was great, but I was rather disapointed in the performance of Ethan Hawke. He is a horrible actor in my opinion, and is the reason I did not like the movie as much. Denzel Washington did deliver an amazing, and deserving of the Oscar (I heard he got. Didn't watch the Oscars myself). I would reccomend renting this before you spend the [money] on the DVD.

0451196716|5.0|I first read \\"The Long Walk\\" about three years ago, and found that it stayed with me for nearly every step I've taken since then.  Any walk of a mile or longer invariably brought up memories of the deadly Long Walk taken by a hundred fictional teenagers in the alternate-history Earth of this early King classic.<br />As other reviewers have noted, just to read this book is to feel physically tired.  The characters start walking, at a grueling pace of four miles per hour, early in the first chapter, and never stop.  There are only two ways out of the contest: death or victory... and, out of the 100 contestants, there can only be one winner.  \\"The Long Walk\\" takes place over five days in May, and by the final day, the Prize may no longer seem worth winning.<br />As painful as your legs will feel by the final chapter, you'll be equally intrigued by the little alternate-history hints King drops throughout the book.  With references to John Travolta and the handover of the Panama Canal, \\"Long Walk\\" is still very much a product of the 1970s.  But when the characters mention \\"April 31st\\", or New Hampshire's provisional governor, or the German bombing raids over the East Coast in World War II, you'll find yourself wondering just how the world of the \\"Long Walk\\" came to be.  Most intriguing is a fictional quote from the \\"second Clay-Liston\\" fight, which ends even worse for Sonny Liston than did the actual Ali-Liston fight in our own 1965.<br />The only thing that disrupts \\"The Long Walk\\" is the ambiguous final page.  King points out in the introduction to this edition that his Bachman persona did not specialize in happy endings, and of course we know that King writes insanity quite convincingly.  I've beem vaguely dissatisfied with the ending after both my readings -- but, taken by itself, the final line is still a creepy finale to a very creepy book...
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan is one of the best bands ever. I went and seen them at the Shelter in Detroit and they were one of the best live bands I've seen in awhile. Not only do they rock out on their cd, they give their all to make their live performance even better...
B000002C1V|4.0|This often brilliant but flawed album is the nearest thing to a Roger Waters solo album in the Pink Floyd catalog, much as \\"Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" would be the nearest thing to a David Gilmour solo album in said catalog. Keyboardist Rick Wright, responsible for the lush keyboard textures that helped characterize Pink Floyd's sound up to 1977's \\"Animals\\", had been forced out of the group three years earlier. Drummer Nick Mason's creative involvement had declined sharply since \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", and guitarist David Gilmour, who had co-written such classics from the previous Pink Floyd album, \\"The Wall\\" as \\"Young Lust\\", \\"Run Like Hell\\", and \\"Comfortably Numb\\", got no writing credits in edgewise this time, was ousted from the production team, and was reduced along with Mason to the status of sideman alongside a bevy of session players, one of whom even replaced Nick Mason on drums on one of the songs. <br />\\"The Final Cut\\" was the culmination of a trend that started with \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", the first Pink Floyd concept album with all lyrics by  Waters, in which all tracks segued into the next and leitmotifs, especially in the form of sound effects, were used to reinforce the album \\"concept\\". Since it worked so well, it seemed the right idea to keep doing it for future albums. But with every subsequent album Waters' concepts and lyrics became more personal and he, understandably, wanted greater control over the album projects, and arguably came to see them as \\"his\\" rather than the group's. <br />\\"The Wall\\" however was a commercial success despite this tendency. Co-producer Bob Ezrin's imput helped make a narrative that was very personal to Roger Waters a more universal statement about authoritarianism, alienation and isolation.<br />The concept behind \\"The Final Cut\\", subtitled \\"a requiem to the post-war dream\\", was not as universally accessible- since it was about the death of Waters' father in World War II and his belief that the dream of a better world,that had motivated men like his father to fight to their deaths in that war, had been betrayed, and that the final betrayal ( \\"the final cut\\") was being dealt by world leaders like Britain's own Margaret Thatcher. You have to have a certain understanding, and more than that, a certain interpretation, of history in order to appreciate the concept behind this album.<br />Also, the music here doesn't sound much like the \\"classic\\" Pink Floyd sound- throbbing keyboards, soaring guitars, and so on. That doesn't mean it's bad, it's just different. Some songs here have a  folk-rock sound  (\\"Your Possible Pasts\\", \\"Two Suns in the Sunset\\"); others have a piano and orchestra backing (\\"The Gunner's Dream\\"; \\"Get Your Filthy Hands off My Desert\\"; \\"Fletcher Memorial Home\\", \\"The Final Cut\\"); and others combine the two styles in the same song (\\"Paranoid Eyes\\", \\"Southampton Dock\\") I like both of these styles myself, although some of the bits meant to move the narrative along are a bit weak musically- including \\"Paranoid Eyes\\", which is redeemed mainly by the organ solo in the middle, and particularly \\"The Post War Dream\\" , which sounds like it could have been done a lot better, and is not helped by a disgruntled Gilmour's guitar playing- he evidently didn't care for that song at all.<br />For whatever reason,  \\"The Final Cut\\" was a relative commercial failure- compared not only to \\"The Wall\\", but even compared to Gilmour-driven Pink Floyd releases \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" and \\"The Division Bell\\".<br />The closest we get to hearing \\"old\\" Pink Floyd music is when Gilmour plays one of his solos, or during \\"Not Now John\\" (a bluesy number reminiscent of \\"Money\\" and \\"Have a Cigar\\", and on which Gilmour sings all but the final verse).<br />The last song, \\"Two Suns in the Sunset\\" is an ostensibly jaunty tune with lyrics which deal with a sudden death on the highway due to the \\"second sun\\" being a nuclear explosion...\\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\" (Roger's father was Eric Fletcher Waters)imagines taking world leaders who make such a holocaust more likely with their bloody military adventurism, to the \\"Fletcher Memorial Home\\", and then, after a discreet interval, applying a \\"final solution\\" to the lot of them. An understandable thought, but it grates somewhat with me, since I find the idea of \\"final solutions\\" inherently creepy, to say the last, and anyway we're all ultimately responsible for what we allow (and often encourage) these leaders to do, as Waters himself suggests when he sings that \\"When the fight (World War Two) was over, we spent what they had made\\" (we wasted their sacrifice.)<br />The main fault, apart from the ones I've already described, is Waters' singing, which is hard to take, especially during the title track.<br />Not for those who like their listening easy.

B00005JKQZ|1.0|It is a predictable irony that John Nash is portrayed as intent on finding an entirely original idea in mathematics in order to achieve recognition and self-validation, while Ron Howard does everything in his power to avoid any semblance of an original cinematic idea, nevetheless achieving recognition from the academy, the box-office, and (most probably) from himself.<BR>*<BR>The subject matter deluded me into hoping that here might lie a serious film.  It certainly deserves to be rendered seriously.  Instead the tired Hollywood formulas and manipulations are wheeled out for yet another airing.  Love, a strangely homogenous and artificial emotion in Hollywood's understanding, is set to conquer all.  Psychiatric treatment, this time in the guise of insulin induced seizures rather than the more time-honoured shock therapy, is villainised.  The Ivy League universities and their associated priviledged 'feeding' schools are seen as a kind of safe haven from all the evils (i.e. realities) of American life.  Music swells appropriately.  There is even a car chase.<BR>*<BR>If you like Ron Howard's other films, and you consider 'Gladiator' great entertainment, then, yes, 'A Beautiful Mind' has the chance of satisfying.  But if 'Mulholland Drive' or 'Requieum for a Dream' is your idea of good American film, then don't bother.  <BR>*<BR>In the grand tradition of Oscar winners, this film is also needlessly long, the very length apparently conveying its intended gravity.  Russell Crowe is needlessly bulked up, and Jennifer Connelly is needlessly beautiful.  Oh, if you've seen 'The League of Gentlemen' you might get a giggle from the pen ritual at Princeton (Pauline's pens...), and if you're a Freudian you might get more than a giggle;  and just imagine if they'd cast Edward and Tubbs as Nash and wife - and the Beast of Royston Vasey was let loose in New Jersey, or (better yet) Hollywood.  One can always dream.

B000065VB9|5.0|You may ask yourself, \\"What have these songs in a minor key have to do with me?\\" Plenty. Often compared to Bowie's trilogy of albums, PG 1, 2 & 3 are all unique in their own way. PG 3 (which is compared to Bowie's Scary Monsters above. No comparison, Gabriel wins hands down)stands as Gabriel's darkest, most compelling masterpiece.<br />Melt has often been acclaimed for its production and arrangements. At the heart of any PG album is the song. PG rarely was as focused as he is here. The lyrics occasionally drift into the preachy, trite arena but not often: Gabriel manages to dissect why assasins kill; take aim at social injustice; investigate the peeping tom in all of us. There's never a dull moment and the lyrics are often thoughtful and powerful.<br />The music matters on PG3 as well. While not as diverse as So or even Security, the monochromatic sound of PG3 works well at brining out the contrasts that fuel life. The cover black and white photography perfectly captures the mood of the album.<br />Enough hyperbole. The sound quality is outstanding and, aside from Security, shows the most improvement of all the PG albums re-released. The packaging for the limited edition consist of the original lyrics and rare photos from the tour to support PG3. What's missing? There's no bonus tracks or liner notes just the original credits at the very back of the booklet. It would have been interesting to hear the work-in-progress tapes for the album and live performances recorded during the tour. The only reason I can surmise as to why the re-released albums don't have bonus tracks is a potential boxed set on the horizon (it would tie in well with the re-releases and Gabriel's Up which is going to be released later--finally--in 2002).<br />The highlight of the PG trilogy, Melt focuses on both the seamy and the profound and finds that there's common ground between both.

0375703861|5.0|I found this novel to be thoroughly entertaining having read it at the urgings of a friend of mine, a professor who selected this as one of a handful of novels he used to teach a cultural collisions course on Muslim culture.  The novel revolves around two, dysfunctional families, one a mix of Caucasian and Jamaican, and the other, supplanted Bengalis.  The backdrop is Willesden, a London borough.  Through the character's perspectives, we become privy to the tribulations of the South Asian ethnic community. A caustically witty book, White Teeth takes on a variety of issues, from religious activism to genetic engineering, and very cleverly brings these issues to the reader's attention through some of the innate absurdities of these same issues.  For instance, Smith practically skewers the Jehovah's Witnesses and their penchant for mistakenly \\"prophesying\\" the End of the World.  Giving equal time to Muslims, Smith also takes on the strictures of Islam.  One of the main characters, Samad Iqbal, makes a pact with God forswearing masturbation in exchange for drinking; both Islamic taboos.  Samad, who is a \\"faithful\\" Muslim, has a difficult time following all the tenets of his religion.  Smith's novel reminds me of Hanif Kureishi's The Buddha of Suburbia, another humorous take on an ethnic family living dysfunctionally in England.  Both are written in an extremely irreverent, yet clever manner, where East and West clash not only on the streets, but also in the homes of these supplanted families.  But Smith takes her caustic tone to a higher plane than Kureishi, her wit and insight shines through on virtually every page.
B00003CXI0|3.0|I have been a Harry Potter fan after the fourth book came out. I didn't see what all the fuss was about and so decided to read the first one for myself. Let me tell you, it really bowled me over! I had imagined so many amazing things, the character personalities, Quidditch matches, etc! I have also listen to Jim Dale's narrations on the books-on-tape and I believe he does each voice to perfection.<BR>The movie, however, was a different story. I understand that WB had to keep the movie under a certain time-limit, but there are so many things left out of the film that it's embarrassing. Everything J.K. Rowling had mentioned in the Sorcerer's Stone was explained in the later books, for example, Parseltongue. If they plan to make a movie for all the books (which I seriously doubt), this little aspect will be important in the other films. There was no mention of Sirius Black, a very important character in the Prisoner of Azkaban, and other little things that serious fans would notice. We took notes during the second time we watched the movie and there were many things missing. I heard that J.K. Rowling herself was at the studio filmings and she told the director how she wanted things to be portrayed, but it's still very lacking.<BR>I will buy this movie, only because I am such a fan, but after the second time in the theaters, I said, \\"That's it, i'm not watching it in here anymore.\\" because even for me, a fanatic in the truest sense, it's disappoiting. Read the book; the movie could never do it justice.
0446310786|4.0|Harper Lee has created a wonderful book containing many details.  One way Lee made this book so enjoyable is the way she constructed her characters.  She made me feel like I was a friend of Scout's and that I knew all of them very well.  Speech played a big role in forming each character.  By the way they talked, you could tell who they were around and how they were acting.  When scout was around all of his friends from school he would cuss and talk mean to everyone.  This showed how scout was trying to fit in and how he was acting aound all of his classmates.  When Cal took the children to the black church she stopped talking in proper English like she always did at home.  This showed the part of her that was her history and culture.  It let the kids and the readers know that around people that she can relate to, she is more herself.  People would talk about Atticus say he was a bad person for defending Tom, but then Scout would get into fights.  The actions of Scout showed us how protective of her family she is.  The way Atticus is being talked about lets us know how everyone sees him.  The other way we get to know these characters so well is how they are described.  Dill is described as a little guy.  This gives us a visual picture that Dill is around the same size as scout and we can begin to see him as we read. Lee did a wonderful job and these characters were very appropriately described.
B00003CWL6|5.0|this movie was odd. i thought it was the second best film ever made saying only the graduate is better. i like the soundtrack. kevin spaceys a great actor. this is a wonderfull film. i love the acting. the story was a mystery. i love those oscar movies though.
B00003CXI1|5.0|A delighful movie for the 21st century... it surely fits, like The Wizzard Of Oz did for the 20th century.  I viewed my new dvd on my new wide screen tv and I was facinated with joy and good feelings.  Entertainment at its best to escape an unsatisfactory day.
630460291X|3.0|I don't have a great deal to say that hasn't been said dozens of times already.  My main point of this review is to warn about the DVD itself.  The version that I purchased is extremely odd in the fact that the entire film ISN'T on one side of the DVD.  Halfway through the movie you are forced to turn the disc over to see the rest of the film.  I'm not sure why this was done, the movie isn't THAT long, and I would think that the entire thing should have fit on one side.  Of course, the problem could just be that perhaps the copy that I received just happened to be an old one that was created in the early days of DVD.  In any case, just be careful when purchasing this one.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I saw this movie when I knew nothing about the film, and was extremely suprised.  It was so good.  The way it's filmed it's a total mind trip.  It starts at the end, cuts to the beggining, then goes back and forth going foward and backwards until both timelines meet in the middle.  The foward is the black and white, the backwards (the action) is in color.  It's great, cool twist at the end.  You'll have to concentrate when you watch it the first time, because it's extremely hard to follow at first.
B00005RFAI|4.0|I'm so bad.  I really didn't like Pink's first cd all that much.  I purchased it on the strength of \\"Most Girls,\\" and then only because I couldn't find the single.  When Pink showed up with \\"Get This Party Started\\" my first thought was \\"Uh huh.  Britney wannabe, hmm?\\"  I had no idea how wrong I was.  When \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" came out, I changed my opinion completely.  The first time I heard it, I was alone in my dorm room studying and had the radio on.  The song came on and I almost ended up in tears.  The first verse of that song could be the story of my life.  The next day I went out and purchased Missundaztood.  This is a COMPLETE transformation for Pink, and it really works very well.  Standout tracks include \\"Misery\\" (featuring Steven Tyler. . .their voices blend together extremely well), \\"Just Like a Pill,\\" (This one really DID make me cry), \\"18 Wheeler,\\" and \\"Going to California.\\"  People who are fans of _Can't Take Me Home_ will NOT enjoy this one.  It's almost completely (with the slight exception of \\"Respect\\") pop, blues & rock influenced.  I hope that people who DIDN'T enjoy CTMH will be willing to give this one a try.  Ignore \\"Get This Party Started.\\"  It really doesn't fit with the rest of the album as a whole, and isn't half as good as the other tracks are.

B00005QIPH|1.0|This album is not all that it is cracked up to be.  After hearing the first catchy single on MTV2, I bought the album, only to realize what it was to me...a boring album with a catchy single on it.  Anyway, these kids must have had a lot of money and the right connections, because I can bet that there is a garage band down the road that can beat the snot out of The Strokes' talent and songwriting ability.  Some of these songs sound like a fourteen year old with a guitar and a drum machine.  If you are stuck in the 70's, you might find some sort of value in this album, otherwise I would stay away from this totally mediocre and mundane cd and save the fifteen bucks on a cd that actually took some sort of creativity and thought to put together.
B00003CXDD|2.0|It boggles the mind why so many people liked this movie so much. It has a small cast of one-dimensional characters, an overused storyline, bad acting, and laughable special effects. Don't watch it.
B000002B7S|5.0|Some consider this album to be a weak point..how they arrive at that is beyond me.I'm older now(LATE 30'S) and I still love this album ! JAKE E.Lee had some big shoes to fill and has done an excellent job.I saw Ozzy with Randy back in '82 and it was a great show ! Honestly, he was just another hot guitarist at the time.Had he not died I really doubt he would  retain the notoriety he had after his death.Ozzy did an excellent job with this comeback considering the terrible tragidy of Randy's death.This is a classic LP of ballads,progressive,and sheer hard rock that has not and unfortunately will not be duplicated in comparison by modern bands.It is produced and engineered so well.I highly recommend !  Give it a chance if your not familiar with it !  It is worth buying since bands these days are putting out nothing short of garbage that has absolutely no substance what so ever !
B00003CXTG|1.0|...This was one of the worst movies I have EVER seen. The actors were bad. The plot was bad. The script was bad. All this stretched out into three hours of suffering. Well, OK, two hours - the pearl harbor attack sequence is pretty cool, but you have to wait through an hour and a half of bad dialogue to get to it. Don't waste your time here. Move along.
B000065U1N|5.0|Powerful and madening.  Worst part is that is it all based on true facts (sure some license taken).  These mem were true heroes, but never needed to me.  Bas decisions at teh HIGHEST levels put them in harms way, and they shined.  This movie is hard as hell to watch as it is britiant and painful.  Show to your kids when they are old enough so they can understand the price of freedom....
B00005QDW1|2.0|The good news first - - the music itself I think is an improvement.  No Doubt is a band on this CD, not just Gwen's support.  But it ends there.  Most of the songs consist of a funky little beat with 2-4 lines of lyric...that's it!  They repeat the same 2 lines of lyric over and over again, eventually fading out and calling it a song.  It's a poor effort, and makes me wonder if they were in a hurry to get the album out...examples: Hella Good, Making Out, Underneath it All, Don't let me Down, Running, In My Head, Platinum Blonde...it goes on...and on...and on...<br />What a disappointment!!
B000062Y98|4.0|If you are tired of hip bands, playing tuned down, one finger mud, look no farther than Blind Guardian's Night at the Opera. This album shows that there are still talented metal musicians. They  just  all live in Europe. These guys are good. Night at the Opera is a fantasy metal epic that progresses into Dream Theater territory at times. The overuse of the chorusing can become redundant, but overall this is a great album.
B00003CXBH|5.0|What do you get when you add the direction of Roland Joffe with the explosive screen presence of De Niro and Jeremy Irons who play two Jesuits striving for a common goal but with different mindsets supported by stars like Aiden Quin and Leam Neeson. Mix it with a superb musical score of the haunting pan pipes by Ennio Morricone (music director of The God Bad and the Ugly, the man with the harmonica etc)- feast for the ears and the amazon rain forests (especially the fierce waterfalls) as the scenic backdrop to the re-enactment of a true story. In a nutshell the story deals with the politization of religion and also the transformation of De Niro from a self-seeking mercenary to a selfless jesuit. The transformation is complete in the scene when inspite being shot and on the verge of death, his thoughts and gaze are on Irons. Man, what a movie.<BR>Just one question - why is this movie still not out on DVD inspite of being the winner of an international award.
B000000W5L|5.0|...this would, without a doubt, be one of the albums I would want with me.

B00001NFCY|2.0|Creed never really has much appealed to me. Scott Stapp's voice is good, but boring. All the songs on this are also boring and WAY to soft. The only really good song is \\"What If\\" and \\"Higher\\"'s OK, but nothing special. Personally, I don't see what all the hype is about them. Well, anyway, if you want some good Christian rock, get POD's \\"Satellite\\". That's all.
6305718903|2.0|Despite a good performance by Patricia Arquette, cast as a working-class hairdresser in Pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a souvenir and somehow experiences Christ's wounds, this film is a loser. The subject itself might have been intriguing if it was anyway near what Catholic theology actually is, but the filmmaker got it all mixed up and targeted the film towards the outrageous and impossible.  There's supposed to be a conspiracy to keep Christ's words from the faithful and there's also some sort of satanic possession going on which keeps the special effects people busy.  Gabriel Byrne plays the priest who tries to help her and also is attracted to her, but he's just about as believable as the rest of this awful story.  It's true that the film did move fast and held my interest, but only because it was so strange.  I give this a \\"thumbs down\\". Don't waste your time.
B00005JKJA|2.0|Since others have described here in some details the plot developments of the story, I only have some comments about the creativity of this movie. Lynch follows in the footsteps of his Lost Highway and undermines the conventional chronological order of the plot, presenting us with pieces of a puzzle which are to be put together. Furthermore, the movie seems to desire to reflect reality as a dream-state which need not make sense logically, but should be felt (reminds me of his Twin Peaks). <br />Well, that's all find and good. The film is an artistic experiment, i.e., Lynch wants to stress that films allow us to perceive the world from one than one perspective. But that is something Lynch has been doing for a while and I don't see any advances here. The plot elements are very slim. He is rehashing common themes (e.g., unhappy director, the mob that controls the industry, women who endear themselves to the audience on the basis of their appearance - and did that one ever work, just read the reviews for this movie on this web site - Harring this and Harring that). <br />What bothers me about this movie the most is that you have to wait for an hour or two for the movie to put itself together. I don't mean that one has to wait two hours for all the pieces to fit. What I mean is that the first 1 2/2 is sub-par filmaking. The scenes are mostly meaningless on their, their feel acted as opposed to lived, and they are strangly surreal (I know this is the point but I am getting tired of being subjected to them only to wait for an hour for the filmaker to reward me for watching them). I dislike movies where you have to wait to be rewarded (and I had the same impression when I saw Sixth Sense, Cooky's Fortune and Gosford Park and was ready to walk about of the theater after an hour). It doesn't say anywhere that a movie that seeks to break presentational conventions does not have the responsibility to be interesting while it establishes its characters (look at Remains of the Day- it managed to built up character and tension and capture the viewer's attention throughout, I think). This complain of mine has really nothing to do with the patience or attention span of the viewer. I think that films are created for an audience. This audience wants to discover a new world. Conventional plot developments and actresses that deliver more with their looks than with the strength of their charater (I thought that was the case in Amelie too) do not create good movies. Was there anything endearing about any of them? Watts' performence was above the rest, but her character still had little appeal - even if she represents a typical actress or the victim of the L.A. scene, I still consider her character unremarkable.<br />While this movie isn't by far bad, I would expect better from Lynch - especially since he makes one every two years or so and certainly does not make movies for the mainstream. I can't think of any reason why I should recommand this movie to anyone but hardcore David Lynch fans.
B00004XQP4|2.0|When I bought this album I was sorely disappointed having once been the biggest Green Day fan in the world. Green Day's older material was punk and never really crossed the boundary into pop. But 'Warning' is the album where Green Day must have been feeling adventurous and decided to step over the line into a whole album of pop/punk. It is disappointing when you have heard some of their greater oldies Nimrod, Dookie, Kerplunk, Insomniac and Smoothed Out Slappy Hours. The style is different and not that of the Green Day once famous for their funky punk albums. Okay so if you liked the singles 'Minority' and 'Warning' then you will like this album as it carries on the same not so artistic style throughout. My advice is, if you like old Green Day avoid 'Warining' like the plague unless you want to feel let down by the once brilliant punk band they were, or, if you liked the single 'Minority' what the hell, you're goning to love it! I have given this album 2stars out of loyalty as an old fan, but between you and me, it is worth no more than 1star. Sorry.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This visually lucious film is without doubt the best of 2001.<br />Clearly, it's polarized viewers.  But I'd venture to say that those who don't like it, simply fail to understand it.  For it is sublime, and dares to challenge the viewer to see the romatic musical in a completely new way.<br />Baz Lurhman takes the MTV music genre to it's highest artistic expression, and has great fun along the way.  Get this movie; you'll fall in love all over again.
B00005JKCF|3.0|I was first interested in seeing Spider-Man when I viewed the previews on TV. I thought maybe just the reception was bad during the animated sequences, but not so. The effects are just cartoony, maybe thats what they were going for. Anyone, I thought the movie stareted off well-We learn about Peter Parker and how he gains his ability, as well as how the Green Goblin reaches his state. AS time went on though, I became less and less interested. The movie was lacking real dircetion, the Green Goblin doesn't have any goal, he just fills in as you all-purpose villain, just waiting for Spider-Man to stop. There were some small children in the theater, and all of them seemed scared when the Green Goblin was on screen, which is good in some ways, but it also goes over the top with this when he is having his own psychological battles with himself. Also, because of the violence, I would also have to reccomend that no children under 10 see it, no matter how hard they beg. BAck to the movie, everyone delivers great performances, and it is a superb cast. Sometimes the movie seems to lag (it is over 2 hours), and often the \\"romantic\\" scenes just fall flat. To sum it up.....<br />1) Would reccomend children under 10<BR>2)Special effects are mostly cartoony (although there are some good rip off's of \\"THe Matrix\\" in it<BR>3)Great cast with good performcanes<BR>4)lags at times.<br />Hope that helps
B00000I01A|5.0|Without a doubt, the soundtrack to Rocky IV overall is one of the best ever made.  With the exception to tracks 3 and 8, which aren't bad songs, it makes up probably the best workout CD ever.   For me personally I recall many memories the New York Rangers 1994 Stanley Cup run with this CD.  The songs I most remember on here are &quot;Heart's On Fire&quot;, &quot;No Easy Way Out&quot;, and &quot;Training Montage&quot;. There is no better song to jog to than the Training Montage.  It has a PERFECT beat to it.  No Easy Way Out is a good song to reflect on a conflict in life.  I often listen to it when I am stressed and realize what I have to do to get past it.  Heart's on fire is just an awesome motivational song.<BR>  Speaking of Heart's on Fire though, this is the only problem I see in it.  In the movie, you have Rocky training to Heart's On Fire, but when he makes his mad dash for the mountain, an orchestra takes over with the same beat, to provide the best 2 minutes of music I've ever seen on film.  You also hear it in the credits.  For some reason though, they've decided to leave it off the soundtrack.  If anyone can help me find that piece of music, I'd do anyhthing to repay you!  <BR>  Other than that 2 minutes that aren't included.  This CD is flawless.  I still give it a 10/10 and highly recommend you buying it.  Dont let those 2 mintues deter you from doing so
0375701427|4.0|This story of Swede Levov is almost a perfect rendition of a man in search of American Dream, and how life and things beyond your powers, can devastate you along with the dream. As some other reviewer mentioned, this novel shares things in common with &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, in theme (as mentioned above) and the narrative techinique (a recessed, observant narrator). This is as muted as a Roth novel will get. The tone of the prose is almost autumnal, and it's unfailingly beautiful at all times. The unraveling of Levov is heartbreakingly sad. The anarchist daughter (probably the only &quot;Rothian&quot; chaotic character in the book) is like a figure from a nightmare, and clashes with the rest of the characters/world of the novel. Other than that, a fine retrospective of a certain era of America (Jersey, of course), and a man who dreamed its dream and wanted to, but failed to do good by it.
6302194296|4.0|I've always been a fan of the silent film era,  and NOSFERATU stands out as one of my favorites.  I had only seen it once on a late night channel,  then I saw this version of it at a Blockbuster.  So I bought it,  got all ready to enjoy it,  and then(although it was still brilliant) the music came on.  This pseudo-scary weird accompaniment totally unhinged the creepiness and overall feel of the entire film.  I ask all filmmakers or film distributioners,  WHY DO YOU THIS?  The films are fine by themselves!  If they're such great cult classics already,  why change them?  Sure,  I can completely tolerate Director's Cut Versions of a film,  geez,  I actually prefer it if that is the vision the director had in mind(Speaking of which,  catch the 20th Anniversare Director's Cut of Dawn of the Dead,  there's an example of a great directors cut).  Anyways,  NOSFERATU is an amazing film,  and I say go see it,  but if you happen to see the cover above,  I would personally steer clear of this version unless you're deaf or have a high tolerance level...See Nosferatu,  the original gothic,  and if that wasn't enough,  catch Shadow of the Vampire.  Willem Dafoe's performance is worth the entire strange little film.  Oh,  and John Malkovich is cool in it too.
B000021Y77|5.0|The Film:<br />Positively unique. While I see parallels between Run Lola Run and its 1999 counterpart, Fight Club, the instances are only fleeting and probably have more to do with the fact that I saw the two films shortly after one another than they do with actual similarities. Or perhaps it's how both films have taken a novel idea and let it run its course, flaws and all, producing something that's much stronger when all's said and done.<br />If the stranger who brushed past you this morning had walked an extra couple inches to their left, what kind of an effect do you think it might have had on the rest of your life? If the film is to be trusted, a bit more than you'd think. One woman, mere scenery in any other film, goes from lotto winner to baby stealer to bible pusher after her chance meetings with Lola. And that's where the real strength lies here. More than anything else, Run is a story about everyday lives, and how conceivably miniscule changes can alter an entire lifetime. Despite the imaginative camera angles and Quentin Tarantino meets Guy Ritchie storyline, the real focus of the movie is the interaction with the regular Joe, and the ultimate result of that interaction.<br />Sure, there are some scenes I'd have done differently. But like they say, hindsight is 20 / 20 and everybody's the world's finest director from their couch (or, in this case, from behind their monitors). Some transitions are awkward, but the characters are there in full force, and the possibly-complicated plot is handled to perfection. Add to that the list of risky camera tricks that paid off in spades, and you've got a healthy package. Highly Recommended.<br />9 / 10<br />DVD Extras:<br />Not exactly a stack of bonus features, but those that are present really do pack a punch. First, and most notably, is the option to watch the film in English or original German with English subtitles... which, if you've ever heard the American voice actors, you'll know isn't really that much of an option. Put plainly, the English dub blows. Go for German with the subtitles, and enjoy the original vocal inflections in all their glory.<br />You also get a feature-length commentary from writer / director / producer Tom Tykwer and Lola herself, actress Franka Potente. This one's a real goldmine, if you're into insightful audio commentary, as the two reveal bits and pieces the uneducated eye would have blown past without a second thought. Honestly, the definition of what a DVD commentary track should be.<br />Finally, there are the prerequisite Theatrical Trailers, which are nothing extraordinary, and a music video from the picture's phenomenal soundtrack. Again, nothing special... mostly just Potente mouthing along to the words of one of the few songs with a vocal track, screaming, and looking a bit bizarre without the bright red hair. It's no surprise the single never really shook the charts.<br />Worth the extra bucks to pick up on DVD, without a doubt. Hell, they could've just given it the German dub and I would've been happy, but the audio commentary makes it all that much nicer.<br />7 / 10on. Put plainly, the English dub blows.

B000002UB3|4.0|The swan song of the Beatles proved that they could rock out right to the end of their days. Now, after listening to all the Beatles albums, I have to say Revolver's the best. This one is very good. How did they do this stuff with only 4-tracks? Anyway, this has 10 songs, with 2 medleys. The normal length songs are good. Come Together is a strange opener, but it rocks. Something is a very nive ballad from Harrison. It's got that unexpected chord change. Maxwell's Silver Hammer is silly. Oh! Darling is an old doo wop song with screaming lyrics. Octopus's garden is, well, just plain strange. I Want You is the darkest tune the Beatles ever did. Here Comes The Sun is the prettiest Harrison tune yet. Nice capo use. Because has soothing harmonies. You Never Give Me Your Money is pretty cool. It's got some cool piano stuff.<br />Then, the medleys come in.<br />I don't want to waste more time, so I will just say that it's a good comibination of ballads, psychadelic, punk, glam rock, and jamming. It's like a symphony, in a way. And then there's Her Majesty. Yea!<br />Well, after getting Let It Be, which came before this, where do you go from here? No more Beatles, everyone. I guess you eithr get their solo albums or just listen to the old stuff, or get the anthology. Bye.
B00005YU1O|2.0|I'll admit that there are many amazing qualities of this movie; the animation over live action technique produces brilliant effects that are visually interesting the entire way through.  The wealth of ideas presented about dreams, life and the world around us are incredibly vast and thought provoking.  The acting (predominantly the voices) is incredibly well done, as is the music.  But unfortunately, there is no plot.  Not only that, but the ideas keep coming at you.  While some of the ideas were interesting, others were not.  And the ones that were interesting became lost in the shuffle.  I went to see the movie with three friends; whithin half an hour they were all asleep.  This movie is a few good ideas and scenes stretched out far too long.  That it keeps throwing out more and more ideas at the audience doesn't serve to make it good...and i'm usually very open minded.
B00005K3NY|4.0|Michael Ironside is head of an underground group of Scanners  -  mutants whose thoughts can literally kill.  He's got a major grudge match going on with the government goons who made him, and the two groups have been engaged in a private little war that slipperily elusive Patrick McGoohan wants to end.  McGoohan brings in unaware Scanner Stephen Lack and clues him in as to what he is, and why he keeps hearing other people's voices in his head.  Lack becomes McGoohan's secret agent, sent out to be recruited by Ironside's group and get the goods on them from the inside.<br />The film is uneven and a bit slow, but heavy on suspense and pretty good special effects  -  which are extraordinarily shocking and violent.  Lack is a little wooden as the hero of the piece, but is credible and sympathetic.  McGoohan plays the role he always plays  -  the less-than-forthcoming, smoothly sly double-dealer  -  and he does it well.  The ever-lovely Jennifer O'Neill is Lack's fearful and reluctant helper and love interest.  Ironside, who frequently plays underspoken heavies, is at his quietly unsettling best as Lack and McGoohan's psychotic quarry.<br />This is a very well done Canadian low-budgeter, as effective today as when it was made almost a quarter of a century ago.  It was the first of the government-created-human-psychic-weapons pieces to follow The Fury, the one that started it all, and is generally better than that film though not as slick.
B00004T37H|5.0|Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke) is by far one of the best anime films of all time. The animation is simply beautiful and the story is great. I would definately recommend this movie to anyone who is just getting into Anime, or who just wants to see a good movie for that matter.
B00005JKJA|2.0|I had high expectations for this movie and was very disappointed. Too many questions as to the relevance of some scenes and their connection to the plot. Anyone who claims they perfectly understand this movie is lying to you. Amazing! All these geniuses cannot come up with a consistent understanding of what the hell is going on. Everyone is using their own imagination to interpret what HE OR SHE THINKS the director's intentions are. I don't care for David Lynch's style of direction. He intentionally throws in scenes and props to create confusion. Unlike most viewers, this causes me to lose interest. I love excellent movies that make you think like The Usual Suspects or Memento. Mullholland Drive is more annoying than clever. A really great movie should puzzle together to form an intense ending. This movie is very over rated with no chapter selection.  I am very relieved that I did not purchase this. I did not find this film interesting enough for a second viewing to gain a better perspective.  There are much better mind teasing suspense/thrillers to rent or watch.
B00003CXA3|5.0|I agree with the reviewer from California - A Clockwork Orange was the best film of 1971 (perhaps of its time as far as shear filmmaking goes) - but The French Connection is probably the best cops and robbers movie of all time.  I have watched it numerous times and it is a masterpeice of filmmaking, acting and storytelling - what a performance by Hackman ... and Roy Scheider as well.  Of course, it's also the first blow of William Friedkin's incredible early 70's one-two punch (&quot;The French Connection&quot; and then &quot;The Exorcist&quot;).  This is one of those rare films where it all comes together.  A must own for any cinema buff.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Back about a year or two ago I used to absolutely love Green Day, I would download every single one of there songs off of Napster live or studio or B-Sides. I would buy all the singles and all live and imports. Times changed and I changed my music to Guster,Dave Matthews Band(awesome),Phish, grateful dead, howie day, john mayer and basically jam bands that give it all up on stage. I soon growed to hate punk music, Ive sorta considered it talentless and annoying and I thought Green Day and Blink-182 [stank]. The other day i went out and found my ole Green Day cd's, this one caught my eye real quickly. I popped it in and i was amazing and how much Billie and the guys brought so much more to their sound, this album is their most artistic one out there. Everybody's got their experimental cd's but this one other then most cd's, doesn't [stink], Billie opens up his talented abilities by throwing in a Mandalin, Accordians, Acoustic guitars, keyboards. Such good tunes as Warning,Church On Sunday,Misery, Macy's Day Parade, Waiting, Monority, and Fashion Victim score, but Hold On and Castaway and Deadbeat Holiday tend to bore you after awhile. The extra Enchanced part of this cd is a dousie, There 30 minute video showing off the cd was made was great and added more to them, and showed what goes on in the recording studio. Overall this cd was extremely well-made, a new turn but for the best, and I hope Green Day continues this way( Which would make sense considering there hitting there 30's, and since punk is teenage trend, and once you hit late teens you realize you've wasted half your teenage life but im not here to start [stuff]with people and not to critize). Overall good cd for a long time favorite.
B000002KP3|5.0|This album is a classic and shows the true genius of Marc Bolan. The rest of the band's contributions are stellar as well and the strings, great congas, and other instruments add to the overall effect of this monumental masterpiece which has no doubt influenced many glam rock, punk, and hard rock bands more than 30 years after its release. The music is rock at its finest because it is very sexy yet poetic, strong, and stylish. This album has loads of substance and is a joy to listen too. I wasn't even born in 1971 but am sure glad to have discovered Marc Bolan and this album in 2002. Get it and stay away from most of his greatest hits albums. His original albums are well worth hearing.
B00005QDW1|2.0|This CD's first single &quot;Hey Baby&quot; is obnoxious to say the least, although because I am such a loyal fan I ignored the warning signs and bought it anyway, I should have known better.  This CD is one of the worst reggae-pop mixes I have ever heard.  I know that the ska-punk scene is forever changing and for that reason I supported the change in style found on their last CD.  After &quot;Return to Saturn&quot; I figured No Doubt was maturing, but this set back totally killed my support for them.  Honestly the vocals are so-so and Gwen's signature voice does a decent job of carrying a tune, but the lyrics in songs like &quot;Hella-Good&quot; make me want to vomit and for that reason alone I would suggest people stay away from this calamity.
0060975768|5.0|I had alredy seen the documents of the battle, then I got the book from a VN veteran. Then I saw the movie.<BR>The book is absolutely worth of reading. True story of a brutal <BR>fight where the chopper pilots aldo  did what they could but most of all Hal Moore and his men did win !!!<br />This reminds me a lot of our own war agains russians, I am from Finland, Finnish had smal units against huge enemy and in the winter war The FInns won many fights.<BR>Read the Ia Drang book and go to see the movie, they are worth of.<BR>Let's salute all the veterans.
0790731894|1.0|Terrible flic.  Seagal was killed off immediately, thereafter eliminating all possible merit. Couldn't they have at least killed off Kurt Russell in his damn tux?
B00005JKCF|5.0|I must have been waiting for this film since i was 5 years old.And it was worth the wait!Spider-man was always my favorite super-hero and it was about time a movie was made about him.There are a few things that were changed for the film (basically combining Gwen Stacy with Mary Jane Watson;the web coming out of his wrists instead of web-shooters)but it doesn't take away from the story.The CGI special effects are very poor at some parts,but that isn't enough to take way from the movie-going experience.The entire cast was incredible and I was very impressed with the job Sam Raimi did.I am probably going to see it another time or two while it's still out.If you're thinking about seeing this movie,go for it!Even if you're not a 20+ year Spidey fan like me,you'll still enjoy it!
B00005QIPH|3.0|yeah this stuff is catchy and it sounds cutting edge but the strokes are just gimic driven rich kids who buy their vintage clothing in trendy New york shops. This is the most souless music out there and they are treated like the purveyors of the new rock movement when in actuality, they are only mimicing the an allready existing new garage rock revival. This is just pop dressed up in some sort of street cred veil. listen to the hives instead. Or Radio Birdman, or the stooges, or the dirtbombs before deciding how good the strokes really are. I know it's supposed to be just about the music but the strokes' just carry to much contextual baggage to be accepted as a legitimate garrage rock band.
B00003CXBK|5.0|It is brilliant. I would recomend it to fans that like dragon ball Z. It is a really good story. I would recomend it to people 12 and over. The violence would scare kids under 9.

B00005J6UP|5.0|I must have seen Goonies about 30 times.  I was a schoolteacher and it provided a fun break for kids from 5 - adult. I never get tired of the constant action and the fun characters.  The only disappointing thing about this movie is that once I saw the long-version on t.v., the version WITH the octopus at the ending, and I really liked it.  It's too bad that the dvd did not contain this longer version.  I guess I keep comparing the movie to that really great long one I saw, and it just never measures up.  The dvd was definately worth buying, though.  I'd watch it many more times.  Have fun, go nuts.
078322608X|4.0|incredible film. art/indie style film. great acting. brad pitt is incredible as jeffrey, the mental patient, leader of the army of the 12 monkeys. genius film, with incredible plot twists.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters 3 times and was highly anticipating its DVD release.  I was not disappointed.  Luhrman provides the audience with tons of special features and takes complete advantage of the options available on DVD.  Add that to the fact that this movie is a spectacle of light, sound, costume, and acting, and you get the return of the musical!
B00003CXSP|5.0|Best horror film in years. anthony hopkins is amazing as doctor lecter. incredible acting by julianne moore as well. the special effects are brillant. the movie in genius as horror and on the levels of humor of the situations created.excellent film. excellent directing.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I was surprised to find myself enjoying most of the songs on this CD.  On her previous ones, I liked 2 or 3, but on \\"Britney\\" I like all the songs EXCEPT 2 or 3.  She did well to sing fast, edgy songs that fit her raspy voice rather than trying to pretend that she can sing.  Even the ballad, I'm Not a Girl, is good and doesn't ruin the tone of the album.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club is and incredible movie about living outside of what we are brought <BR>up to believe. The society in which we live is very materialistic and we are <BR>raised believing that material possessions are essential to our survival and our<BR>happiness.

It is clear that despite the <BR>philosophy that \\"Tyler\\" has taught the narrator, he quickly becomes a fascist <BR>leader running a terrorist organization.

Tyler the projectionist splicing single frames of porn into family <BR>films, the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry, and saying things like<BR>\\"sticking feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken.\\" The film is not <BR>only a serious abstract commentary, but a comedy as well.<br />If one walks away from Fight Club with anything, it should be an open mind,<BR>the idea that what we are told may not be correct, and a laugh.
0446310786|4.0|Nelle Harper Lee did a job well done when writing this book. To Kill a Mockingbird reminded me of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, describing the truths of humankind's hate and prejudice. Lee's novel was based on her own childhood past in southern Alambama in the 1930's. She put the aspects of prejudice, discrimination, stereotypes, and justice into an intelligent child's perspective. As most other child-point-of-view books, I found To Kill A Mockingbird more thought provoking than adventuresome. \\"Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit `em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\" A mockingbird sings its' heart out to make beautiful music, and never eat up gardens or nest in corncribs. That's why it's a sin to kill them. Lee used the symbolic mockingbird to depict the innocence of a few of the characters in the book. Such as Tom Robinson, a black man who never did a thing to harm anyone else, but was accused and charged of rape to a poor white woman because of his race. This book unmasks a county's feelings of prejudice and hate. The author incorporates a man defending to save a black man's life while teaching his children the unjust ways of the world. \\"As you grow older, you'll see white men cheat black men every day of your life, but let me tell you something and don't you forget it - whenever a white man does that to a black man, no matter who he is, how rich he is, or how fine a family he comes form, that white man is trash.\\"  Lee did a wonderful, unlike any other author, in making a book about the maturation of a child and the steps made into the real world.
B00005QIPH|3.0|It's been a little over six months since this cd has been released, and now I'm able to listen to it without all the hype.  Do you remember Menswe@r?  They were a British band who put out a cd in the mid 1990's.  Better known for their looks than their music,  their pretty decent, though derivitive album was savaged by people who saw them as pre-packaged teen idols.  The Strokes are the American Menswe@r.  Their album is good, but derivitive (though I'd like to know where the Television comparisons come from.  I hear Lou Reed and Lust For Life era Iggy Pop, but Television?  Are the people who are making these comparisons really familiar with that group?  I'm guesing that they are very young, and the name evokes some sort of fantasy CBGB's era from before they were born.  Televison were a new wave Quicksilver Messenger Service with extended songs and intricate interplay between two lead guitars--the Strokes are much more stripped down) and alot of people dislike them because teenage girls find them attractive.  These people should get over that.  There are alot of better Velvet Underground rips out there ie. The Dream Syndicate's Days of Wine and Roses & Yo La Tengo's President Yo La Tengo, let alone the first Modern Lovers album, but my God, there is so much worse!
B00005QB42|5.0|I discovered this CD during a yoga class at a meditation retreat in the Blue Ridge mountains of Virginia. The beauty of the music struck me right away. I interrupted the teacher in the middle of class to find out what was this wonderful music. Bought the CD as soon as I got home. That was two months ago. Now I play it and play it and can't stop playing it. It's just extremely soothing and I don't get tired of it. My favorite is the classic Guyatri mantra. It's magic. Go buy this CD and do some spiritual healing.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Life is Beautiful is a film I will always love on a greater level than I have loved any film.  It presents life, love, and pain together in an experience that is not just a portrait or a tale, but a treasure for the soul.  It teaches and reminds us of emotions that we don't feel often enough.  Torn between joy and sadness, the tears flow blissfully and give such a feeling of beauty that one becomes overwhelmed and falls instantly in love with this creation.<br />  This may seem strong or exaggerated if you've not seen this film, or if you saw it and were blinded by the blend of comedy and the holocaust.  This is a base view and if this blocked your enjoyment of the film, please hear this:  the film does not make light of the holocause or suggest that it did not cause such magnitude of pain that we cannot understand it; the film is so poignant because you experience the joy of a family filled with life and see it fight the terror.  I'm enamored by this strategy and I want to experience it again.  Though in one moment I felt such sadness and even anger, the recollection of the joy that preceded it [in the film] and the knowledge that some of that joy will live and grow, brings a perfect blend of emotion which leads me directly to a viewpoint on life that is realistic and at once optimistic, hopeful, and seeking beauty.  I recommend this film in such high regard that I believe it will change your perspective, or remind you of a perspective you've lost or left.
044022165X|4.0|From the viewpoint of sheer enjoyment, this is probably my favorite of Grisham's books, except, perhaps, for The Testament.  The plot is complex, the characters are quirky, and, after the first hundred pages are so, the writing is sharp, humorous, and impossible to put down.<BR>  <BR>Rudy Baylor is a soon-to-graduate law school student to whom everything bad is happening.  Even when you think he's hit bottom, things keep getting worse.  He loses his girlfriend, his job prospects, his financial self-respect;  he's rousted out of bed by cops and implicated in an arson, he's reduced to working for a sleazy law firm that chases ambulances and represents strip clubs, and even that job is shaky. <br />While the book is thoroughly entertaining, it stretches the limits of credulity at times.  The evil insurance company Rudy sues, and everyone who works for it, are totally devoid of any redeeming moral traits whatsoever;  the judge is unbelievably sympathetic.  As a rookie lawyer trying his first case, Rudy can do no wrong in the courtroom.  Still, rooting for the good guys and hissing at the bad guys is part of the fun of the book.<br />The book raises some sticky moral questions that are glossed over, such as Rudy's relationship with an attractive young married woman, her husband's violent death, and the subsequent cover-up.  And there are some dangling loose ends I would have like to have seen cleared up, such as who actually committed the arson of which Rudy was suspected. <br />The ending was unexpected, and yet exactly what it should have been.  It left me slightly misty-eyed, and wishing that modern authors used that device of 19th-Century writers, telling us what became of their characters in the twenty years or so after the book.  My guess . . . Rudy becomes a high-school history teacher in Laramie, Wyoming, he and Kelly have three kids, and they never set foot in a courthouse again.  Read the book and see if you agree.
6303430570|4.0|Okay, I went back and watched this again after all the other Kevin Smith movies came out.  This movie, in the &quot;View Askewniverse&quot;, is essential, because plot lines, jokes, and people from most of Smith's other movies all have their seeds in &quot;Clerks&quot;.   Sure, Dante's whiny, Randall is an *ss, the acting is lousy, and the film maker's personal obsessions make up the majority of the dialogue, but, well, it's just damn funny - and it's happening right now at your neighbourhood 7-11.
B00005UW7V|4.0|The film has obviously polarized people. To my mind it isn't as good as its proponents would have, nor is it as bad as its detractors claim.  One can only wonder how polarizing Kubrick's version would have been.<br />It is the Kubrick legacy that haunted my viewing of the film.  But, this doesn't really come into serious play until the last part of the film.  The first two thirds of the film is fine, with astonishing special effects, and a story that moved right along.  I was drawn into the story of a robot child (Haley Joe Osmont) , given the &quot;artificial&quot; (or is it?) capacity to &quot;love&quot;, and his adventures into this post-apocalyptic world when his &quot;mommy&quot; abandons him. <br />Compelled by the myth of the Pinnochio story that had been read to him, he searches for the Blue Fairy so that he can become a real boy too.  With him on this journey is another robot named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) whose function is self-explanatory in his name.  All of this is done well, with fabulous set design (Rouge City being a delirious riff on Las Vegas), and state-of-the-art effects.  Much of this design was provided by Kubrick's pre-production planning and artwork.<br />What detracts from this modern fairy tale is the long last section, which seemed to me to have several climaxes and could have stopped anywhere in a couple of places.  It was at this point I wondered &quot;How would Kubrick have ended this piece?&quot;.<br />My opinion, based on absolutely nothing but speculation, is that Kubrick would have ended with David being slowly encased in ice and forever asking the Blue Fairy to make him a real boy.  But, maybe Stanley would have elected to carry the ending forward as is done in Spielberg's film.  No matter.<br />When you look at the absolute drivel that passes for popular films today, to say that A.I. is a bad film is preposterous.  There is much to like, and much to admire in this film.  That it didn't hit it out of the park does not diminish from the fact that it was a full swing at it!  Worth a look!
B00003CXZ3|5.0|I absolutely adore this movie.  The format speaks to the content, the content is very original, funny, spooky and thought-provoking.  With repeat viewings, the talent of the people who made this movie becomes evident.  I always hated Guy Pearce, but after this movie and his brilliant performance, I have nothing but respect for him.  Imagine how hard it would be to play this character, let alone be someone who suffers from short-term memory loss.  I've read case studies about things like this, and his portrayal of a man searching for some, any, meaning to his moment-to-moment existence is remarkable and heart-wrenching.  This is the most perfectly put-together \\"mind-[mess]\\" movie I have ever seen.
B00005RRG9|5.0|This DVD is a sure sign that Disney has been listening to all of the complaints that there is not enough extra material on the DVD releases of their movies.  The Parent Trap is way out there with really cool extra material.  Not only do we get a great copy of the movie, there are SOOO many extras!  Just trust me and get this one---it comes very close to the Platinum Edition of Snow White that was released last year.  Enjoy!
B000007489|5.0|One of the most underrated bands, but respected no matter what, the Suicidal Tendencies brilliant debut album is an all time classic that shows what real punk rock is, and what real hardcore is.  \\"Institutionalized\\" remains an all time classic song of vocalist Mike Muir venting so much its unbelievable, while \\"I Shot the Devil\\" and \\"I Saw Your Mommy\\" are just great punk/thrash songs that you can easily get into.  The Suicidal Tendencies are without a doubt one of the most influential bands in the past 15 years, and they make pretenders like Blink 182, Sum 41, and Green Day show how its really done.  I strongly recommend picking up this classic as soon as you can, this is what real punk rock is all about.
B00005JKCF|2.0|The new movie \\"Spiderman\\" proves how Hollywood over-kill can squash any sense of fun found in the adventures of comic book heroes. The movie is uneven, long and overdoses on computer special effects. The beginning scenes offer promise as Peter Parker (played fairly by the pensive Tobey MacGuire) is bitten by a super geneticized spider and metamorphisizes into Spiderman. However, the spider theme is hurriedly abandoned; it would have been great to have Parker cohabit with the anachrids as Bruce Wayne did with bats in \\"Batman\\". Once the villain enters the picture, the Green Goblin, the movie stretches for its plot. Wilhem Defoe is wasted as the Goblin; his costume could have been from the Power Rangers TV show and his banter with his alter-ego in the mirror is truly laughable and ridiculous. Kirsten Dunst is bland as the heroine and the viewer wonders how Parker could stay infatuated with her for so long! Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are also wasted as the Aunt and Uncle of Parker, and the moral message is simple beyond belief: \\"With Power comes great responsibility\\". Haven't thousands of movies and books dealt with this theme over the years? Danny Elfman's score is a copy of his own Batman themes, and director Sam Raimi (remember the 1980's bomb \\"Dark Man\\"?) copies a scene out of Burton's film by having a bunch of giant balloons showcased at a city event. \\"Spiderman\\" has none of Burton's macabre or Richard Donner's (director of 1978's \\"Superman\\") sense of fun and tongue in cheek homage. Also, the computer special effects make people move in positions which would break most people's backs or necks, regardless of whether they are superheroes or not.
B0000636UN|1.0|The aqua net hair bands of the 80's died swiftly when the 90's hit; not so with the \\"anti-hair bands\\"  of the 90's.  The legions of un-glamorous  lead singers strumming acoustic guitars are alive and well.  <br />Indeed,  Sheryl Crowe is the embodiment of that 1990's stereotype;  her music encourages people to enjoy the  \\"simple life,\\"  though she prefers the life of a multimillionaire. <br />Yes, the classic hypocrosy that defined music of the 1990's is coming through loud and clear in Crowe's latest album.  Crowe has a  \\"communist friend\\" whose gas she can't afford.  She sells millions of records but can't put gas in her car, see.  She loves her impoverished way of life, and ecourages us to love it too.  <br />She preaches to us, saying \\"It's not getting what you want/ It's wanting what you've got.\\"  Apparently Ms. Crowe thinks that complacency is the answer. Is that how you got your multimillion dollar record deal, Cheryl?
B000001FS3|3.0|A while back I had written a scathing review on this CD as at the time, I really found many of these songs to be overplayed and the instrumental stylings to be quite bland.  At that point, I thought of U2 as the most overratted band on the plannet.<br />After listening to the entire CD a few times, I admit that my initial assessment was way off.  Some of the less commercial tracks on this CD are quite touching most notably One Tree Hill, Running To Stand Still, and Red Hill Mining Town.  The harmonies on the chorus on the later piece are the highlight of the album.<br />Then of course, there is the intense soloing by the Edge on Bullet In The Blue Sky and the eerie mood on Exit.  Bono's vocals are pretty cool on these tracks as well.  I even admire the fine crafting of the hit singles With or Without You and I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.<br />U2's political somewhat angry tone is not always totally pleasing to me over the course of an album on a relgular basis.  However, I can certainly appreciate the beauty within many of their songs and would recommend this and Achtung Baby as two prime U2 recordings.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|First movie review I've written. I read some of the other reviews so there isn't much I can add except to say I found this movie wonderful, haunting, quite simply perfect. I did not understand all of it but that is not the point of the movie. It was just excellent in every way. <BR>And it was great to see Ms. Barrymore in another non-stereotypical role. She was instrumental in getting this movie made and we should all be grateful and only hope she will continue to make decisions and choose roles like this.<BR>I rarely buy movies. This will be one of the few.<BR>I urge everyone to rent it at least once and give it a try.
B00003CXS4|2.0|despite the all-star caliber cast, this script is contrived and badly structured, making it hard to pay attention to the movie.  The cinematogaphy and idea behind the plot are good; however the acting is sub-standard for this group, and ultimatly, this is smiply boaring.  Don't bother renting it, and certainly don't buy it.
B000031XCR|2.0|i dun see the need for this. or any of the new songs.
B00003CXSP|5.0|Many people didn't like this movie and thought it didn't live up to the first movie but I'm not one of those people. I think this movie perfectly followed up the first story with the exception of the new Clarice. The story in this movie is extremely good. Hannibal's victim using Clarice to seek revenge on him. Clarice saving the man she fears only to be stuck at a dinner table and watching Hannibal feed a man his own brain? That scene was very sickening and hard to watch but I just couldn't tear my eyes away. The only let down is that this movie doesn't let you get to know Hannibal more. I'd like to know the first time he ate somebody. Maybe there will be a third one but I doubt it.

630521610X|5.0|It gave birth to a series of horrible movies (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legends) but watch it. It's a very clever, funny, exciting, and YES, scary movie. I mean can you watch that very beggining scene with Drew Barrymore, in your basement, at mid-night, and not be scared? That scene's a real masterpiece, and kicks the movie to a very fast start instead of wasting time on nothing. <br />Don't get me wrong, the movie is really fast paced, but it's got great character development. Each character in this movie is well developed and realistic (I'm not kidding). <br />The plot isn't quite your usual \\"stupid scary movie with lots of hot girls showing their breasts off and having sex while smoking pot and getting slaughtered by an unkillable, emotionless killer,\\" no. Scream has a plot. A year ago, Sydney Prescott's (Neve Campbell) mother (Lynn Mcree) was brutally raped and muredered. Sydney fingers Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), and why shouldn't she? She saw him leave wearing his bloody coat and all evidence points to him. However, when Steven Orith (Kevin Patrick Walls), and his girlfriend Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) pop up dead late one night, and Sydney's friends start dropping dead, she begins to suspect that maybe she fingered an innocent man, and her mother's killer is still on the loose. But, who's the killer? <br />Scream co-stars W.Earl Brown, Courteney Cox (Courteney Cox Arquette), David Arquette, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Joseph Whipp, Jamie Kennedy, and and cameos by Wes Craven, and Linda Blair. <br />I know I said this movie isn't just sex, nudity, murder, and gore, but it delivers in some areas (don't get all excited, no nudity). There's a truckload of gore (even more if you can get the director's cut) and lots more guts then I had expected to be in a movie of today. The death scenes are elaborate, well staged and exciting. Even better, we actually care about the teens in this movie. They're likable because they all know thatthey're in a horror movie and the \\"rules.\\" <br />The cast is excellent, each actor does great. Neve Campbell does sympathetic teen really well, Rose McGowan (as her friend with a variety of skimpy outfits, Tatum) does great. The off-beat boyfriend (Skeet Ulrich) is played well. All the other actors are great, but it could take hours describing them all here. <br />kevin Williamson really did great with his script here. He doesn't think to much of himself like he does now, and givers the movie a never ending energy. Wes Craven (A Nightmare On Elm Street) brings the film to life vividly and I wasn't bored for a second. No dought he helped all the actors in looking scared (marvelously) and the opening with Drew Barrymore must be seen to be believed. That's what I call scary! <br />The DVD (Dimension Collector's Series) is a keeper, despite having some minor problems. One of the (minor) problems is the non-anamorphic transfer. Being an owner of a widescreen TV, this annoys me, but the picture is still genuinely good. It's crystal clear and free of blemishes and grain. It just would have been better with an anamorphic transfer. Still, good picture quality. The second problem is that the version on the DVD is the original theatrical version, and not the director's cut mentioned above. There isn't to much of a difference, but there's more guts, blood, and gore in the unrated version. Just a little problem, again. Nothing extreme. <br />Those problems are basically nothing when you come to the good stuff about the disk. The great commentary by Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven (also on the earlier disk) is here, and it's a real pleasure. I've listened to it several times and still get a kick out of it. They both seem at ease and point out interesting facts I never noticed about the movie. Other features are two trailers (red band and green band) and over five TV spots. there's a short production featurette and a behind the scenes thing that's interesting. There's a cool special effects gallery. Also, you can ask two questions with the cast and crew (\\"Why are people so fascinated by horror movies?\\" and \\"What's your favorite scary movie?\\"). There's also a \\"Did You Know\\" section that gives out some interesting facts. A nice array of special features. <br />The films remastered in a booming, beautiful 5.1 surround sound that will please all. Dialouge is clear and easy to understand and the action sequences are loud and exciting. <br />Scream's great. I am not ashamed to like it. It's one of my favorite movies and I find it clever and witty. Forget those people who diss this movie and see the masterpiece (the Oscars for 1996 really missed this one). Also, the two sequels are almost just as good. I'd recommend getting the box set (I own it, and love it) because it has an exclusive Collector's Edition of Scream 2 and a bonus fourth disk. It's well priced, too.
B000002KC5|5.0|Before the Disney soundtracks, there was this. Randy Newman's earlier quirky observations (Mamma Told Me Not To Come, Dayton Summer of 1904, Beehive State, etc.) finally congealed into this stride-piano landscape of the American South. It's dated and timeless....a vehicle back to the good old days when Ry Cooder was Randy Newman's warmup act....
6300215512|4.0|As an young male I probably am not the target audience for 'Sunset Boulevard'.  However, I found myself become gradually engrossed in it one afternoon and it stands up very well today, over 50 years on.  The story concerns bankrupt scriptwriter Joe (Holden) that comes across faded silent screen siren Nora Desmond (Swanson) in her lonely old mansion, resided over only by her creepy butler.  Persuaded to stay and help her with her defunct movie script rather than pay off his debts.  What follows is both dark, sordid and compelling as the couple's relationship becomes more and more twisted.<br />Obviously meant as a satire on fickle Hollywood this is every bit as relevant then as it is now.  Here Swanson is superbly grotesque, teetering on the edge of insanity as she deludes herself that she'll be back on the silver screen in her own movie before long.  Alongside her Holden becomes just as unstable as he is faced with a choice between his glamorous yet doomed relationship with Swanson and a script writing career with the girl that he truly loves.<br />This was a very good movie that holds you throughout.
B00005QW5X|5.0|Well, this film caught me by surprise.  Sure, I'd heard the raves and critical appraisal, but the plot of the film didn't sound too appealing to me.  (SPOILERS>>>) After all, that's about a German homosexual/transvestite Glam-rock singer who marries an African American military man to come to America, where he has a relationship with a 17-year old son of a preacher who he later stalks because the kid stole his music to become a big rock star.  Hmm.  It certainly sounds like the plot came from waaaay out of left field.  BUT, that being said, I decided I would be adventurous one day and I borrowed this DVD from my local library.<br />As I said, I wasn't too sure how I would react to this film, but very surprisingly, I ended up liking it a LOT.  The plot actually makes a lot of sense in the context of the film, and it's quite enjoyable.  Still, I suppose you would need a somewhat open mind to see this film.  If you've seen other films like \\"Tommy,\\" \\"Performance,\\" \\"Liztomania,\\" \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show,\\" \\"Pink Floyd's the Wall,\\" or even \\"Moulin Rouge\\" then you'll have a idea what this film is like.  However, the film is the best of the bunch.  How good is it?  It's better than Moulin Rouge by far and the music is from the original off-Broadway production and is just about the BEST rock music I've heard in any rock musical.  It totally kicks ...and rocks hard and had me humming the tunes to all the songs before long.  I believe if the Academy Awards folks had possessed a more open mind, they would have nominated this for best picture instead of Moulin Rouge.  Furthermore, only a technicality prevented any of the songs from being nominated for best song, which they could have easily won.<br />Bless DVD technology...I practically had the songs from the film on auto-repeat for a few days before I had to return the DVD.  This is probably one of the best musicals to be released in the last 20 years (Little Mermaid and Evita and Everyone Says I Love You are some other greatrecent ones).  The DVD, to say a few words, has a commentary by the director, who is also the writer and plays Hedwig on-screen.  Plus, there is a cool 90-min documentary about the origin of the play and the film...really nice stuff!  New Line produced a great DVD, and whereas I initially had some reservations about seeing this film, now I am absolutely going to add it to my collection.<br />Totally recommended and absolutely a 5 star rating!!
0064407667|5.0|I enjoy the writing style of \\"Lemony Snicket\\".  I love that the author dares to write with dark humor ...especially for children.  These little books are much more creative and witty than the over-rated Harry Potter series.  I could BARELY get through the first book of Potter.  The hype on Harry is excessive!
B00003CXTG|4.0|What was supposed to be the summer of 2001's biggest blockbuster turned into, in comparison, a flop. The movie critics called this movie things like, \\"terrible\\", \\"boring\\" and a cheap knockoff of legitamate war movies. Why? I really liked this movie! I mean, yeah, it had wasn't the most historically accurate movie and there was a cliche'd love triangle, but still it was a great movie. Movie critics were a bit harsh of this fine piece of cinema. If you give it a chance..and you're not overly critical..you will enjoy this movie for what it is: historical fiction.
B00005R2M3|4.0|The first time i heard \\"underneath your clothes\\" was on the music video without looking at the screen.  didn't know jack about the \\"latin pop dancing diva.\\" 'captivated by the sound but could have sworn it was a \\"new country\\" song, ala Shania Twain, with all the formulaic voice trills and drops, even the words gave me a faith hill-like hit.  and then i look at the screen and realize who it is, doin' the slut look far beyond mariah.  good set of songs, great voice, eerie mix of country ideoms, celinesque middle notes, alanis/mariah jumps and pops.  I just can't reconcile the song/words/sound/video/repuation of her cross-over cd.  can't wait to see who she turns into on her next cd.
6305558175|5.0|When I saw this movie for the first time, I had no idea what it was about.  I was drawn in from the first.  Gere and Foster are excellent in their roles and the love between them is quite believeable.  The story sucked me in and I was totally involved with the characters.  I don't usually get sucked into movie plots - I prefer them just for entertainment.  But this one pulled me in so deeply that when the ending came, I was crying my eyes out and I was shouting, \\"No! No!\\" at the tv.  I was shellshocked at the ending and angry that the conclusion could be that way.  So, I guess the film makers earned their money on this one.  I highly recommend this wonderful movie.  Unfortunately, I was so traumatised by the story, that I haven't watched it since.  I don't think I have the courage to go through the upset again.
B00000099Y|5.0|This cd has about 3 not so good songs although the rest TOTALLY redeem the album: no-one will ever be able to equalise the awsome singing of maynard.On this album: the songs are unique: this and lateralus are the best albums of all time.
B00003CXXP|5.0|A Surprising love story, that will leave your mind spinning. This is not Blade Runner or Planet of the Apes. Too many people expected another &quot;Hero saves the oppressed masses&quot; but this is a very touching sad story that really will pull on those with children. <BR> I don't believe younger children should not see this film. There are several very emotional scenes and most teens will probably get bored with the length of the film and lack of fast paced action scenes. <BR> The ending did have me believing they were aliens and I thought that should have been more clear. Probably would have been a better film without Stanley Kurbrick's darker vision
0446310786|4.0|To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, is truly a classic book in the history of American literature, and will always be a favorite book of mine. The book tells the story of Jean-Louise    (known as Scout) Finch, a young girl who learns very valuable lessons beginning at the tender age of six. Most of her time is spent with her older brother Jem and Dill, a boy about Scouts age who visits every summer.<br />As the book begins, the reader discovers that Atticus Finch, the father of Scout, is an attorney who is about to tengo with an extremely controversial case. Tom Robinson, an African American who had respect for anyone and everyone, was accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a poor white girl who also happens to be the daughter of Bob Ewell, a low life racist who was out to get any negro he could. Although all evidence is circumstantial, and although Mr. Atticus Finch did such a good job representing Tom that we could all be sure he was innocent, Mr. Robinson was found guilty of rape. While in jail, Tom makes a fatal mistake and attempts to escape from prison. As he tries to climb the fence, Tom is shot seventeen times and his life was put to end.<br />Even though the case was a major part of the story, many other adventures occur during the course of the book. To find out what these other adventures are, your just going to have to read it for yourself!
0783227019|3.0|When I first watched this movie I really doubted that Penelope Ann Miller was cut out for the \\"stripper\\" role. But her acting (and her nice body, too) turned out quite fascinating. Actually Al Pacino, Sean Penn, John Leguizamo (\\"Benny Blanco from the Bronx\\"), Luis Guzman, James Rebhorn... all gave good performances as well. However, with such a strong cast -- plus the exceptional talent of Brian de Palma, this film never got out of the shadow of \\"Scarface\\" to make a surprise on its own. Probably because the plot was full of cliches. To me, the only scene that's worth a playback was the Kleinfeld - Brigante confrontation in the hospital. It got me to understand what \\"Carlito's way\\" means.
0767817710|4.0|Very entertaining film of a most implausible gunfighters' contest.  Highlights include director Raimi's over the top camera work as well as an outstanding back-up cast including Lance Hendrickson, Jonothan Gill, Pat Hingle, Tobin Bell, Roberts Blossom.  No, Bruce Campbell is not visible even though he's listed in the credits.  Authentic armaments:  when was the last time you saw a \\"My Friend\\" knuckle-duster in a movie?  Great score too!  This was Woody Strode's last film.
B0000029LG|5.0|What an album. The first disc has all of his greats on. So that is brilliant with out a doubt. But this is not really why the album is so great, sure it does add a little something but I think it should have been released seperately.<br />Disc 2 is were the real magic happens. <BR>It starts off with one of the best dance songs ever done, Scream. Not only does it team up with his superstar sister Janet but it is so well executed. Brilliantly produced, well written and great voices pull it off. <br />They Don't Care About Us, an angry song about racsim never have I heard such a strong song lyrically as this one, MJ has a lot on his mind and does he express it with style. <br />Stranger In Moscow is so well done. It is a calm relaxed song and MJ's voice sounds better than ever. Great beat to go with it, play it loud to really feel the song. <br />This Time Around sees MJ stepping into the Hip Hop genre and with a quick verse from The Notorious B.I.G. adds a lot of funk into the song.<br />Then we get to Michael's best song of all time, Earth Song. There is not a single thing wrong with this song, and MJ produced, wrote and perfomed it proving that MJ is truly a genius. It centres around the fact that we are destroying the earth (True) and we how we aren't doing anything to save it. The last two minutes are the strongest piece of music I have ever heard. <br />D.S., Money and Come Together don't really stand out but are still great songs with funky beats. They fit into the album quite well and are different from what MJ normally does. <br />Then there is You Are Not Alone written by R. Kelly. One of his best ballads ever. <br />Childhood is a song that I don't like. It is everything that I hate about MJ his lame loving children side and the song is really not classy at all and I am very dissapointed in this song.<br />Tabloid Junkie is a great song about how the critics have made him into a freak and is really funky and just a really cool song.<br />2 Bad is brilliant.Again MJ ventures into Hip Hop territory with this song. He pulls it off so well. This is one of the stand outs on the album and features Shaquel O'Neill. The intro into his rap is simply brilliant. <br />HIStory is a weird yet amazing song. It has various clips of famous times in history for mankind. Then it combines this with a great beat and it turns into a really great dance song.<br />Little Susie and Smile should be put together because they are so similar and I can rap them up into one word Lame.<br />This is Michael Jackson's best work ever and is underrated. Buy This Now!!!
0446678430|1.0|After reading several of his books, Kiyosaki has run out of things to say. If this were his only book I would rate it 4 stars because he does share alot of valuable information. The reason I would not rate it 5 stars is because he repeats himself over and over and over and over again. He also misquotes the Bible several times. If you have read his first book then borrow this one if you have time to kill.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to this CD.  Sadly, I admit, while I have heard it on the net and in stores only a billion times, I haven't bought it yet.  However, it is really cool!!  <BR>     The biggest theme on here, I think, is rather dark.  But, I personally enjoy that.  Since I never, never like to listen to reason when I'm irritated, I think it's nice to have music that matches my mood.  <BR>     The sound is like that for most of the CD, but \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" is a really cute song that I like alot.  Very happy and joyful sounding.  I'm not sure why, but even the first time I heard that song it sounded familar. <BR>     As I recall, the song \\"Lothlorien\\" is really kind of mysterious sounding, but I don't think you can hear that bit on the Amazon sample.  That song also includes a section that, not seperately named, is ment to be the lament of a friend.  <BR>     I think that, although the entire CD is wonder, the real jewels are \\"The Council of Elrond\\" with \\"Aniron\\" (Aniron is the part I love) and \\"May it Be.\\"  The vocals by Enya are enchanting, the Elvish [and English] lyrics are great, the overall effect is wonderful.  \\"Aniron\\" has a beautiful, mysterious sound (a lovesong written in Elvish, song and translation at Enya.com or SongMeanings.com), and \\"May It Be\\" is beatiful, and full of hope.  Once I learned the lyrics to \\"May It Be\\"  I couldn't stop singing it for days.  <BR>     This is really one of the coolest soundtracks in the world.  I love all kinds of music (Except for junk [I think so, anyway] from the Eighties!) from Enya to Stacie Orrico (Highly reccomended pop artist, awesome urban sound) to Toby Mac to ANYTHING!!  So it's really hard to decide what CD to buy.  But, I will DEFINITELY have to add this CD to my collection, and I recommend that you do too!
1558908323|3.0|Guillermo del Toro's effectively creepy bug movie is a fast-paced, exciting (and gooey) thriller starring Mira Sorvino. However the film has a mainly &quot;been there, done that&quot; story about a deadly virus called Strickler's disease, that is killing many children, and Sorvino's character finds a cure by genetically- modifying cockroaches. The nasty critters get set free in the world, and several years later people start getting picked off by giant bugs that have evolved to &quot;mimic&quot; their predator: Man.<br />The action, which mostly resides in the trademark underground railway tunnel, is inventive, and there are some genuine shocks and twists along the way. The messing with nature theme has been done before (Jurassic Park), and the film is very similar to The Relic. But there is a strong environmental message that, while good, thankfully isn't heavy-handed and doesn't get in the way of some cool bug-splosions and hapless kids getting munched. Disgusting fun.
B000009RC2|5.0|One of the things that I am put off about most of Mahavishnu's music is that all their songs seem to be just fragments of riffs and ideas that they try to stretch out for 5 minutes or so.  What winds up happening is that the idea gets beaten to a pulp by minute 2 and I can't listen to it anymore.<BR>I find this album to be the most entertaining because, although they still will take a riff and play it for 5 minutes, they venture into other places and themes with the song.  For example, the Dance of Maya (still my favorite Mahavishnu song) has a very long head that they'll play around, which has a beat that keeps you guessing the first few times around.  Right when it's about to get old, they flip it into a sort of bluesy style, which they jam around very thoroughly, and then go back to the head before you start getting bored.<BR>Then there's Awakening... well, that song makes the whole album worth it.  I still don't know what note's they're playing the whole time, but it's definitely something that Awakens.  All in all, I think this is their best, and one of THE best of their genre; I love their sound, their style, and the fact that the music jams without sounding dueless.  Definitely a must have.
B000062XFG|4.0|For some reason, unknown to at least me, the networks in Australia showed Series 2 of ST:TNG when it debuted out here.  And to be honest I'm glad they did as I doubt I would have become so impressed with the show had I seen the first series initially.  The cast really do come together very well, Picard is more likable(for want of a better word or phrase)and far less uptight, the relationship between Riker and Troi starts to come into it's own right from the first episode plus Geordi and Worf seem much more comfortable in their new positions as engineer and security chief.  Also the relationship between Dr Pulaski(who I have always liked) and Data is quite good, if not a little bit like the relationship between McCoy and Spock.  <br />I'm only giving it four stars because although there were excellent shows, there were also some less than memorable ones.  The best would have to include &quot;Elementary, Dear Data&quot;, &quot;A Matter of Honour&quot; and &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot;.  Others that are also good are &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; and &quot;Unnatural Selection&quot; plus one of my personal favourites &quot;Manhunt&quot; as I love Lwaxana Troi!  And while I agree that &quot;Shades of Grey&quot; is weak, I would hardly call it the worst.  That honour has to go to &quot;The Royale&quot;.  Truely horrendous.  At least as far as clip shows go &quot;Shades of Grey&quot; is tolerable, well that's my opinion!<br />All in all though, considering that production was hampered off stage by writter's strikes, writter's coming and going and big budget cuts to episodes, Season 2 is very good and sends the programme off onto bigger and better things very, very nicely.
0767805712|4.0|Gattaca totally bombed at the box office. The ... folks call it a \\"low-profile\\" release. Yeah, right. It grossed less than $10 million, despite a big budget and a big cast. But it was poorly marketed (check out the horrible trailer), and the public just didn't dig the dark subject matter without any of the usual high-tech accoutrements -- such as nifty explosions, CGI characters, the like.<br />I however loved the lack of special effects in this movie. This is science fiction in a pure sense -- not as popcorn movie, but as a thought-provoking look at what certain advances in science will bring about. <BR>What if we could genetically engineer all human life? That question is taking on added urgency with each passing cloning revelation. <BR>What if pollution got so bad that life expectancy rates were to drop sharply for all who did not have special genetic enhancements?<BR>What if genetic fingerprinting technology got so good that you could not do ANYTHING without the government knowing about it, because their genetic sniffers could detect the DNA in the skin cells you shed every second?<br />This is not far-out sci-fi, this is plausible, near-future sci-fi. <br />It has excellent acting performances, including a wonderful Jude Law before he became really famous.<br />As added bonuses, you get a really taut thriller and a decent love story to boot. <br />But leave the popcorn in the cupboard: this is a pretty dark movie with a pretty bleak vision of the future. Twizzlers would be more appropriate.<br />Enjoy!
B00005YXZH|4.0|First off, I love Wilco. They combine a reverence for history with punk initiative better than any band in America today. Therefore, it was with eager anticipation that I tore off the shrink wrap to get my Wilco fix. And lo and behold, at the end I went...wha? So, I listened again...and again...and again. It's that kind of record. An album that requires a real committment from the listener. There are poignant lyrics and stories and this is the stuff Tweedy and Co. are made of. But Radio Head, Latin Playboys, Mitchell Froome and Tchad Blake do the production better than these guys did , this time. And that, my friend is the point. I felt that Wilco made me work to hear this record. I had to prove my love to hear this. This will be a critical darling, the reviews are glowing. But for those of us with nothing to prove, just our love of Wilco, it's a 4 star record and that's only because we were fond of 'em in the first place.
B00004STPT|5.0|Hans Zimmer's score for Ridley Scott's Roman masterpiece is a score worthy of the library of all-time greats. A Scott collaborator for the films Thelma and Louise (1991) and GI Jane (1996), Zimmer's music encompasses all the varied emotions and excitement present in his most frenetic work. From the stirring \\"The Battle\\", to the colossal \\"Barbarian Horde\\", the score is suitable for a boys-own adventure, with enough sudden thumps and thunderous cues to place it safely in the \\"excellent soundtracks\\" section of anyone's collection
B000056HRZ|5.0|Very good service and the quality of the box and tape are excellent. I would buy from this seller again without a problem.
B000062TU1|4.0|Harry Potter is a great series. It pulled out my imagination and captivated it.  I was very gald to hear they were making a movie but i wondered how they would find things that stayed true to reader's images. Well, Harry didnt look like Harry. his hair was too neat and he looked, and was, too shy. But i can deal with that.  Ron wasn't a hot-head either. Hermione-she was cast very well. Draco wasn't mean enough, though.  The picked out a very nice Castle.  it  was how i pictured it. Hagrid's hut wasn't, or the dorms. They skipped a few scenes, and made other things drawn out or happen too quickly.  Though it sounds like im complaing, i love the books so im an awful critic. But, I do think the movie is very good. I do reccomend the book. I'm reserving a copy.
0446678430|5.0|This is the third book of Robert's I have read.  I took my time reading this book, reflecting on the different points he has made.  A blueprint or outline on how to become rich, this book is not. Started me to thinking differently on issues of money and achieving life goals, it has.
6301697707|4.0|\\"Tremors\\" is a delightful surprise of a monster movie, taking advice from the old-fashioned 1950s films of its kind.  Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward star as a couple of independent cusses that come across an extraordinary discovery--a decapitated sheep rancher and his gruesome devoured flock.  Along with a earthquake specialist, they are forced to fight for their lives against a pack of underground flesh-eating, giant worms.  Superb performances from Bacon and Ward, who carry the film with their charming wit and ruthless attitudes.  Excellent special effects and a script that doesn't take itself too seriously makes \\"Tremors\\" one of the most entertaining, campy monster movies of the last ten years.  Director:  Ron Underwood.  Cast:  Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, Finn Carter, Michael Gross, Reba McEntire, Victor Wong.  Rated PG-13 for violence, gore, and language.  98 minutes.
B00000ILDF|3.0|Pre-Fight Club David Fincher directed this misunderstood entry into the Alien franchise. While it's a flawed film, it does touch on some themes that weren't done in the first two, and there are some effectively creepy moments.<br />The special effects quota reverts back to the original's modus operandi of not showing the aliens as much as James Cameron's &quot;everything and the kitchen sink&quot; trademark. Which is rather effective and creepy, utilising the old &quot;hiding in the shadows&quot; trick. And Sigourney Weaver is good as the tough-as- nails Ellen Ripley. Still, it's disappointing compared to the first two films, because the action is subdued, the characters are cardboard and the plot is very silly. But there is some good action, and while the nihilistic ending would have seemed to rule out the possibility of a fourth entry, Alien Resurrection carried on the story to bigger, and arguably better effect.
B00003CXI0|5.0|I think this is the best movie! I'd see it again, and would definitely recommend it!! The acting was great, the casting superb!
0345350499|3.0|I followed the advise of the people who told me to read this novel because it was a \\"gem\\" of a book. I agree that it is very well-written, with a rich vocabulary and a good rythm and style. Also, the idea of presenting the facts of the Arthurian legend from the point of view of Morgana is original and attractive. However, I didn't like the main character, Morgana proper, in that she is a pessimistic person who is always complaining about the hardships of her life. She seems not to find anything to enjoy and ,from the beginning, she is presented as a looser, even though she has a clear mission that should make her feel alive with passion. If, in spite of the fact that her people and religion are doomed to disappear, she has so many things to do, why is she always moaning? For me, a likeable character is one that shows a passion for life, despite the hardships. I have to add that this is one of the first fantasy books that I read, and it deterred me from reading more of this genre for some time.
B0000636UN|2.0|That's what I said when I listened to the whole cd. Now, \\"Soak Up the Sun\\" is cute, granted. It's got the hit formula down. \\"Steve McQueen\\" hits the mark, but the rest - C'MON, Sheryl. I actually had to get out the old stuff and listen to remember why I like this girl. Yes, she is good, but this collection is not her best - it's formula pop and to me, that is the death knell. I owned this one - notice I say \\"owned.\\" I gave it away after I heard the line, \\"You're an original, Baby,\\" once too many times.
0792846303|2.0|This is a disappointing follow up for John Carpenter after the exceptional &quot;Halloween&quot;.  Jamie Lee Curtis stars in this early 80s horror romp (what a surprise) about nineteenth-century colonists back from the dead who terrorize a modern-day fishing village.  &quot;The Fog&quot; lacks any real thrills and no major plot developments, as well as wasting the talents of Curtis and Barbeau.  Look for Janet Leigh (&quot;Psycho&quot;) who is actually Jamie Lee Curtis's real life mother.  Certainly not one of the better Carpenter efforts.  Director:  John Carpenter.  Cast:  Jamie Lee Curtis, Adrienne Barbeau, John Houseman, Hal Holbrook, Janet Leigh.  Rated R for violence and profanity.  91 minutes.
0767836324|3.0|The only oddity in the Spielberg cannon, Hook sticks out like a sore thumb from the director's output during the late 80s to early 90s. Critically mauled on its release, the film has been seen by some intelligent critics as an underrated film that, with closer inspection, isn't as bad as most critics thought. Robin Williams is Peter Banning, the corporate Wall Street businessman type who was once Peter Pan, but who has long since forgotten all about his childhood. Then along comes Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman) to kidnap Peter's kids and take them to Neverland. Peter is then faced with having to remember who he is so he can rescue his kids. Grannie Wendy: \\"You must try to remember\\" Peter: \\"Remember what?\\"<br /><br />The Spielberg themes are clearly displayed in the first half hour with the busy father never managing to spend time with his kids. And bits and pieces of the classic Pan tale were seen in E.T. Here the director's trademark visuals and astounding imaginative ideas are spread all throughout the film. One scene in particular, where Peter's kids are \\"hook-napped\\", where we see the \\"light\\", once used to touching effect in Close Encounters, here symbolising fear. John William's brilliant score underlays the themes and emotions, producing a great soundtrack to accompany the film.<br />Then it's off to Never Never Land, where Peter must try to remember who he is to save his kids. The problem is, once the film gets to the fantasyland, events get somewhat clustered with a number of overly loud visuals. And despite some great lines between Williams and Hoffman, the film tends to slip into sentimentality often, and Williams gives an uneasy, stilted performance as Peter when he is trying to remember. Sure, the effects are great and the strong Spielberg themes are nice, but until the finale (where we are greeted with a huge battle between good and evil, classic Spielberg), the film drags on for some time with some uneasy emotions and action.<br /><br />The principal acting is good, with Hoffman barely recognisable but portraying the title character to good effect. Williams, although not his usual one-liner comic self, is at least an enjoyable character once he reverts back to being Peter Pan. Bob Hoskins (Who Framed Roger Rabbit) plays the character of Hook's assistant Smee with relish. The only disappointment is Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell. The casting is unusual however, in that Spielberg's films usually make stars like Harrison Ford and Sam Neill, but here, working with established stars, Spielberg's vision is over-clouded by a bunch of big-name actors. But the sets, visuals, music and class storytelling redeem the film, and although it's not one of the director's best, it's still an enjoyable adventure.Hoffman barely recognisable but portraying the title character to good effect.

B00000DG1R|3.0|This is a very good album, but a number of excellent tracks are definitely missing and a few bogus ones have crept on there too, in my opinion.
B00004TH6O|5.0|Rated R is a sublimely diverse work. Sure it's rock music, of one form or another...but wait - that's just it! Of what form, exactly? Christ! Try to define this album and you'll be hard pushed.<BR>But that's not all that makes this album so appealing. QOTSA are a band based around the proven talents of main songwriter Josh Homme and esteemed loony Nick Oliveri (both formerlly of the legendary stonerrock pioneers KYUSS). After that, the concept of &quot;band&quot; does not apply to QOTSA - we find a broad and ever-changing array of interesting musical contributors instead. And this is the key to the particular and peculiar wonders of QOTSA - they are the ultimate band's band. Yes, the tunes are accessible to regular music-lovers like you and me, but they are also held in great regard by the members of many other admirable bands...so much so that high-profile guest appearances abound on Rated R, and more are to follow on their next album.<BR>So we have here a hodge-podge melting-pot of a band, hard to categorise, and ethereal in substance. So what's the vibe like?  Homme himself has said that he'd like to move away from the stonerrock finger too often pointed at them due to the their history with Kyuss, and has suggested that, if their music style must be called something, then let it be &quot;robot rock&quot;. But this label might more fittingly have applied to their self-titled debut, loaded with huge, repetitive, trance-inducing riffs. Rated R, their sophomore, however, is less suited to this labelling. For the most part, it's punky, groovy, and psychedelic, with a good dollop of hard, crunching rock. What it's NOT is angry, political, or egotistical. And that in itself should be enough for you if you prefer having a good time to whinging or screaming abuse - if you buy this, you most probably will not regret it. I would have rated this album 4 and a half stars if I could have, but on this occasion I'll give the benefit of the doubt - maybe not a total timeless classic, but great tunes and great people. 4 stars just doesn't seem to do it justice. Enjoy the ride ;)
6301871952|4.0|Director Joe Dante (\\"Pirahna\\") is back at the helm after a six-year hibernation, continuing the story of those mischevious mutant monsters.  This time, they invade a futuristic New York office complex run by a billionare, and only Galligan and Cates can save the day.  Just as exciting, scary, and humorous as the original, \\"Gremlins 2\\" is unique in it's slapstick and laid back approach that actually works in various ways.  If you're looking for a fun 2-hour romp with little green goblins, a cute furry pet, many crude sexual jokes, and a pulse-pounding musical score, this film is certainly for you.  Director:  Joe Dante.  Cast:  Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates, John Glover, Robert Prosky, Robert Picardo, Christopher Lee, Dick Miller, Jackie Joseph.  Rated PG-13 for slapstick violence and profanity.  114 minutes.
B00003CXTG|3.0|Michael Bay's re-creation of the historic Pearl Harbour is a visually stunning, yet emotionally puerile film that lacks the frenetic fun of Bay's earlier films. Why Jerry Bruckheimer and Bay ever considered this mammoth of a movie is anyone's idea (stick to dumb action films guys), and the love triangle of Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale is frankly mind-numbingly-awful. While the huge battle scenes for the attack on Pearl Harbor are impressive, the film loses stars for being far too cardboard and unrealistic. But it is impossible to deny that the colossal battle scenes, bombs, big things exploding and action are really good, making for an impressive action film that is enjoyable if you can stand the yucky emotion.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|This is quite simply Duran Duran at their peak!<br />This has been voted one of the top 100 albums of the 20th Century and - IMHO - definitely also in the top 20 of the Eighties<br />Great stuff
B0000636UN|3.0|I would say the album is a 'buy' based on but 4 solid songs, none of which seem to be featured (tracks 9,10,11,13). It's maddening to hear in 'Steve McQueen' that she quotes the 'Hoo Hoo' of Steve Miller's 'Take the Money and Run'. 'C'mon C'mon' starts with a patented Rod Stewart mandolin intro and by the time the chorus is over it feels like you just heard a poppy version of Joplin's 'Piece of my Heart'. Sheryl has the ear, the vocal and instrumental talent, and collaborative skill to craft great songs. So why does she fall back on overt theft? That said, there are some remarkable and unique compositions on this album that betray what she's been capable of in the past. My favorite by far is 'Abilene' which I have listened to about 100 times. In my opinion this is easily one of the top 5 tunes she's ever recorded. Everything great about Sheryl and her collaborations come together on this tune and it's a perfect frame for her voice and sense of blues. The arrangement, harmonies, and instrumentation are masterfully rendered and the song feels fresh. 'Diamond Road', 'It's Only Love', and 'Weather Channel' also stand on their own.
0380789035|5.0|This was my first Neil Gaiman experience, and I can't wait to read much more of what he has created. This novel is not for those who want a short, quick entertaining read, because of the length of the novel and the many short detours. But it presents very interesting views of religion and the significance and value of a single life, along with lots of other stuff. The characters are solid and well-drawn. My only complaint is the name Shadow. It seems too much of a pet's name, especially when his wife calls him &quot;puppy.&quot; My advice to a reader is to read this book as an experience, not a story, and savor every bit. Neil throws a lot of stuff at you, so be prepared. Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it, and recommend it to anyone looking for something different.
B00000K0EA|3.0|Bond no. 18, directed by Roger Spottiswoode, is a solid entry into the franchise, yet fails to reach the heights of the excellent Goldeneye (1995).<br />The plot is silly and contrived, with the &quot;stealth ship&quot; thing being the most far-fetched concept the Bond writers have ever come up with. Still, considering that Ian Flemming's Novels (that were the backbone of the earlier films) aren't there, the ideas are suitable for the series' continuation of villains and their hideouts.<br />Pierce Brosnan fits into the role of Bond more smoothly, rather than the &quot;take the money and run&quot; act in Goldeneye, and Michelle Yeoh is good eye candy as the obligatory &quot;Bond chick&quot;. The main villain Elliot Carver is a big disappointment, with nothing much to do but talk about the media, making for a very weak bad guy.<br />But the action is good in parts, including an outstanding scene with helicopters and motorbikes, David Arnold's score marks a return to the staple Bond theme, and there is a welcome amount of things getting blown to bits.
B000056NX5|5.0|Well, I remember when I first saw Jesus Chirst Super Star on the stage was 1990 in Korea. Of course, the actors were Korean and the lyrics were in Korean. Then, I saw it again in 1994 in Seoul. Finally I had a chance to see it in London in 1996. It was so excellent, and I never forget the great musical.<BR>Now, I have an great opportunity to keep the DVD of JSC for good.<BR>I was so surprised that it is much different from 1996 version, and it has more modern than before. <BR>But, still I am so impressed by Andrew, and the director of this film.<BR>Whenever I see this DVD, I remember the scene in London, and I want to recommend it to my friends.<br />I prefer Steve Balsamo as Jesus, though. I don't think Glen Carter is better than him. Anyway, Glen was Simon in 1996.
B00004X0ER|4.0|To tell you the truth, I think this cd was pretty good. I agree with some people though when they say that The Strokes are better, because they are. They sound more original and developed, but I think any fan of The Strokes, The White Stripes, or even just the really cool oldschool stuff (i.e. The Ramones, Velvet Underground, ect.) should look into buying this cd. In a world where everything is about your Britneys and Justins, You just need a little sanity. The Hives aren't the best band ever, but they are so much cooler than most anything else.
B00005JKNF|5.0|This film is, without doubt, not only one of Altman's<BR>best films it also is a wonderful example of some of<BR>the best ensemble acting ever filmed.

B00004XPP0|5.0|I just bought this new release of the original Star Wars trilogy, and I was very much impressed.  The picture and sound quality is excellent for VHS, and, though some are not needed, the additional segments were interesting to watch.  I'm guessing that most of you already know the story, and if you do, great, but bear with my brief synopsis' of the videos for those underprivileged souls who have not seen them.<br />  IV: A NEW HOPE.  Often referred to as the first movie, it is actually the first of the TRILOGY, not the series.  It quickly opens with the capture of Princess Leia Organa, Senator of Alderaan and the escape of See Threepio and Artoo Detoo, the two comical droids.  Play then switches to the intro of Darth Vadar and the skeletal Governor Tarkin and then to Tatooine, home of \\"Ben\\" Kenobi and Luke Skywalker.  They go on a mission to bring the plans of the Death Star to Alderaan, assisted by Han Solo and Chewbacca, owners of the Millenium Falcon, respectfully.  The first segment of the trilogy culminates with a lightsaber battle, retreat to the Rebel Base, and exciting mission to destroy the Death Star.  A five star movie.<br />  V: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.  My favorite of the series, part two begins on the ice world of Hoth, at the new Rebel base.  Not long after the opening, the base is discovered and attacked by Imperial troops with Leia, Chewbacca, Han, and See Threepio escaping on the Millenium Falcon and Luke and Artoo heading for training with Jedi master, Yoda.  The Falcon takes shelter in an asteroid field to begin repairs, where the blossoming relationship between Han and Leia becomes evident.  Luke starts to harness the force to aid him on Degobah.  In need of help, Han goes to his friend, Lando for supplies and shelter, only to find a rather unpleasant surprise waiting for them there.  The best movie of the trilogy.  Five star material.<br />  VI: RETURN OF THE JEDI.  Beginning where \\"ESB\\" left off, our heros are on a mission to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt's palace.  After the reunion, Luke heads off to Degobah to keep a promise to his Jedi trainer, Yoda, while the rest ship back to the Rebel base to get the low down on the second Death Star's construction.  Han leads a strike team after Luke returns from Yoda (some rather interesting news from him, by the way, folks) to the forest moon of Endor to disable the shield protecting the Death Star.  This movie is practically all action, ending with the Battle of the Ewoks, Vadar and Luke's showdown, and some interesting revelations.  The creepy Emperor Palpatine makes his appearance.  My least favorite of the trilogy, but still a good story.  Four stars.<br />  There you have it.  I urge you to purchase these videos: It is well worth your pocket change.  A NEW HOPE also includes a twelve-minute trailer on Episodes I and II and how Lucas plans to tie up all the loose ends.  Extremely watchable, without a killing number of spoilers.  If you want more info on any of these three movies individually, see my reviews for each on this website.  <br />  Final Word:  A definite worthwhile expenditure of your money.  A must-have for any Star Wars fan or movie lover.
B000060P79|5.0|I love Simple Plan!  Their heartfelt lyrics paired with upbeat tunes make for an amazing sound.  I heard &quot;I'm just a kid&quot; on the radio and loved it, so I downloaded some more of their stuff, and loved those, too, so I got the CD.  Every track is awesome and will get you pumped up.  Some of my best-spent money.  It's music you can relate to and identify with.  If you're at all into punk, emo, alternative, or rock, definitely get this CD!
B00005RHGK|2.0|I finally saw Jeepers Creepers today, and it was pretty bad. It was really good until the Darry kid went into the basement of the church and they showed close ups of the bodies. They were really fake and basically looked plastic. But the first 45 minutes of the movie was really good. But then it got kind of stupid and then continued down that road until it finally ended. Most movies end with some feeling of closure, but I would say that this was the worst ending of a scary movie that I have ever seen. I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you don't want to be scared and just want a semi-suspenseful movie.
630439845X|5.0|I can't honestly review it because my wife explained it to me, and I realized she was right. The entire film is purely symbollic, nothing is to be taken literally. The cold woman is unlocked by the gentle, strong, primitive man, dumping the piano overboard symbollizes her ability to talk again, to respond sexually.
B00005V0X5|5.0|This review doesn't have anything to do with the music, as this disc has been around forever and you should already know the magnificent nature of this groudbreaking artistic masterpiece.<br />What this does have to do with is how much BETTER this album actually sounds now that Dave and Dave have taken the master tapes back in the studio and remixed the ... out of it. My God...it's brilliant. I mean, it sounded OK for being recorded in '84. But due to some well documented money squandering (well, of what money there was) on the part of Mustaine and Co., the album ended up sounding like a cheap demo. But, for a cheap demo it literally changed the face of hard music. Because of this fact it sorted grated on you after time. It was neat that it had a gritty quality to it, and by no means did it [stink]. But now...OOOOOH...it actually sounds better than Peace Sells and So Far, if you can believe that. You can really hear everything as it was meant to be heard...and FELT. It's super evil...super heavy and Faster Than ..., baby!! The demo tracks included are kind of cool to hear as it gives you an idea of the process, but the main quality of this release is it's new life. It's like hearing a brand new release from Megadeth...the OLD Megadeth which I miss very much.<br />The only negative thing about this release is that it was made after the legal battle that Megadeth had with the rights to publish \\"These Boots\\".  The actual owner of the music did not allow Mustaine to use the lyrics, so now the singing is pretty much bleeped out throughout the whole track.  While this is dissapointing, it doesn't take away from the rest of the CD.  It's actually quite funny at times.<br />I'm really glad that Dave and Dave decided to do this, because it just made a brilliant work 1000% better. I absolutely recommend picking this up. It'll change you.
078062565X|5.0|This is unquestionably the great monster movie ever made.  The plot is not just an excuse for a monster to go on a rampage, the characters are unforgettable, and the special effects truly blow me away.  An overzealous producer named Denham embarks on a voyage to a secret location with the intent of shooting his most daring movie ever.  Forced to choose a leading lady at the last minute, he bumps into a down-on-her-luck young beauty, Ann Darrow (played by the gorgeous Fay Wray).  They reach the previously unknown island in the Pacific, encounter a group of natives who are less than pleased to see them, and verify Denham's story of a huge wall blocking off a section of the island.  Ann is kidnapped and left as an offering to King Kong, who makes his dramatic appearance halfway through the film.  The crew go after Kong, encountering such obstacles on their way as a giant dinosaur and sea monster.  Eventually, a subdued Kong is brought to New York City to be exploited for money; taunted by the sight of the woman he adores, Kong makes one last stand, and the ending is cinematic history.<br />It is almost impossible to believe that this monumental epic was made in 1933.  The special effects are just amazing, much better than most monster movies of the last couple of decades.  I have no idea how Kong was &quot;created&quot; by the studio; while he is sort of herky-jerky in some of his movements, the detail of the stop-motion animation is incredible.  I took special note of the way even his nostrils twitch, and his facial movements are all very expressive.  I believe the incredible detail of Kong's features does much to make him such a creature worthy of sympathy.  You can see the pain in his face when he is hurt, and you can clearly see his affection for Ann Darrow.  I should also mention the fight scenes, which are some of the best ever produced.  These are prehistoric animals, and they fight the way prehistoric animals fight--going right after each other in a challenge of strength without any special powers or fiery breath rays.  Most stunning of all to me are the scenes taking place high up on jungle cliffs and later on the Empire State Building.  When you see the ground or the New York skyline and streets way down below, they look quite  real.  Even the most recent monster movies seem to fail miserably at showing their monster up above the landscape below.  I am also somewhat surprised at the level of horrific events in a movie from 1933--when men fall to their deaths, you see them fall and hear their screams stop abruptly when they hit the ground; when Kong fights another creature, victory is achieved in a rather gruesome manner; Kong often puts men inside his mouth and then throws them to their deaths.  I can't say enough about the realism of the special effects in this movie made almost seventy years ago now.<br />No one screams like Fay Wray.  She is the perfect &quot;beauty&quot; for Kong's &quot;beast.&quot;  There is a philosophical tint to this movie, though: who is the real beast here?  Is it King Kong, who forsakes everything he has ever known to pursue the woman he loves?  I don't think so.  The true beast is the movie maker Denham, whose love for money, excitement, and glory brings destruction to a Pacific island and to the streets of New York.  If you've never seen the original movie, I urge you to see it.  King Kong is so much more than a monster movie.  The story is deeper than you might expect, and the whole experience marks a true watershed in the history of movie making.f strength without any special powers or fiery breath rays.

6305972591|4.0|I saw this movie when it came out in '84 and have had some strange connection to it ever since. <br />What's to like? Well, what has always struck me is how well the children are adapted to the surroundings. I actually BELIEVE that these children lived in Gatlin \\"before\\" the filming of the movie. They seem very at home and the small town feel is somehow legitimate. The sound is very good for an older flick, being given the 5.1 treatment, and the score itself is practially worth seeing the movie for... I just love that chanting \\"Omen-ish\\" score, always have. The transfer I'd say is above average, though in places it falters a bit, there is also a handsome insert book that comes with it which is unusual for a rather lowbudget movie. I really like all the leads here, specifically the look on young Sarah's face when \\"Vickie\\" is taken out to the clearing, she honestly looks to be in fear, I almost feel sorry for the young actress.<br />What's to hate? Well, aside from the odd smalltown feel there really aren't many chills from a horror movie standpoint. Also, I've never really liked the end, often turning it off b4 the poor CG ending, but hey, this is '84 afterall.<br />If you have a few dollars and are looking for a somewhat surreal look at small town life, you could do worse than giving Children Of The Corn a look.
B0000399WI|5.0|Often after watching a movie I can immediately review it, finding it easy to pick out scenes on the spot, and remember the better or worse points in the movie, while still fresh. I have not dared to try and summarize my thoughts about &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; until days after seeing it, as there is so much to process, to take in. The minute this movie begins you are thrown into the world that our characters live in, and you do not emerge out from it until the final scene has played out. The acting, direction, scenery, script, cinematography, music...everything is flawlessly connected and interweaved into what can only be described as a masterpiece.<br />Tim Robbins is stunning as the heart-breakingly mild mannered man who is sent to prison, charged with murdering his wife and her lover. I could spend 10 reviews worth raving about Tim Robbins's performance in this film, and it is well deserved. Had anyone else been cast in the role played by Tim Robbins, this otherwise flawless movie would have fallen apart. The perfect look, charisma and acting skill put into this by Robbins makes this entire movie worth while, in itself. <br />It would be unfair of me to explain the plot any further, as this movie is best seen when fresh, and when the viewer is unaware of the turn out, or various surprises that occur throughout the plot. Although not a horror flick, or scary movie...this is perhaps one of the most chilling movies I have ever come across.<br />Visually and emotionally stunning, this movie is right on target.
B00005N9CV|5.0|After returning from a weekend in San Francisco, I listened to this CD every night and every day of this weekend. This woman has such a incredible voice!!! In person as well as on this CD. I have 3 other of her recordings but this one I have to say I enjoyed the most. Good Music, great lyrics, Beautiful accompaniments who could ask for anything more???<br />Well I can say that when this lady is in town again I will not hesitate to go see her once more.<br />Happy Listening
630469878X|5.0|Is there anything more satisfying then a romantic, funny, action-packed, well scripted AND well acted movie? Perhaps, but after watching &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot; I certainly have my doubts. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis star in this highly entertaining, truly heartfelt movie. When one begins this film, you immediately feel the need to choose a &quot;favorite&quot; between the two characters, Thelma or Louise. It is impossible. You can masquerade that you like Thelma more, or that Louise tickles your fancy...but the truth is that both characters are immediately likeable and hard not to love. <br />The basic plot: Thelma and Louise go on a seemingly weekend long roadtrip as a brief escape from their drab, unexciting lives. Their first night out, Thelma has a terrifying experience...Louise, in her efforts to save her, commits a major crime. Suddenly, they are no longer two pals going on a trip...they are fugitives running for their freedom and from the law. As the story progresses, their list of crimes grows longer, and their chances at reaching their destination seem to get slimmer as they get closer to it. <br />A thrilling romp through the southwest, with beautiful acting, writing and cinematography, this movie is a classic &quot;buddy movie&quot;, &quot;road movie&quot; and &quot;chick flick&quot;. Whatever label it is given, it is one of the best of its kind.
B00005JKJA|4.0|For starters, I'll try to give my word without spoiling any of it. The first time I saw Mulholland Dr. I was left with a little bit of perplexity and disappointment. I gave it another meticulous viewing and was amazed at the things that escaped my understanding the first time. Believe me, almost everything in this movie fits perfectly with the plot, and everything is important. If you didn't liked it is probably because you didn't understand it. Give it another try as I did, and believe me, you'll love it when you come to understand it. I gave this a 4 star instead of 5 because of the poor disc features (or lack of for that matter). No chapter selection (at Lynch's request), but an amazing transfer and sound (DTS and DD). If you need any hints or you absolutely want to spoil the fun and be told everything you can find an explanation of the movie online or e-mail me and I'll try my best. HINT: The movie is in chronological order (so don't try Memento-ing it)you just need to watch closely at every little deatil and just watch everything unfold.<br />BTW- A little bit of advise, if you're planning on buying it, wait a little longer, who knows, maybe we'll get a special edition later on.
B000053VAF|5.0|Before I watched this movie, I had heard of the legendary Kevin Smith movies, famed for gross jokes and bad language. It was also labeled \\"blasphemous\\". Fortunately, I did not let these things deter me from seeing one of the most creative comedies I've seen to date. From the first minute to the last, this movie was charming, bright and original. Instead of a typical gross out movie, or a cutesy romantic comedy, this movie had style and a very very original story. It's message, although it could appear offensive to all religions, it did not set out to attack religion and make a mockery of God. Quite the opposite, there were actually some good messages, such as Serendipty (Selma Hayek) says: <br />\\"When are you people going to learn? It's not about who's right or wrong. No denomination's nailed it yet, and they never will because they're all too self-righteous to realize that it doesn't matter what you have faith in, just that you have faith.\\"<br />On a lighter note, the performances by each actor were absolutely fabulous. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck deliver powerhouse performances as the two exiled angels trying to sneak back into Heaven, via a loophole in the law. Alan Rickman, Chris Rock and Selma Hayek light up the film from within, in their performances as other Heavenly beings (the voice of god, the 13th (not mentioned in the bible)Apostle and a Muse). And finally, the main three earthly beings that make this movie what it is: Bethany[Linda Fiorentino], Jay[Jason Mewes] and, of course, Silent Bob[the one and only, Kevin Smith].<br />A truly adorable movie, with edgy humor and a whole-lotta-heart.
B00003CX5P|1.0|You people give out high ratings too easily. This was not a good movie by any standards other than special effects. I can't even bring myself to like those, because they created Jar-Jar Binks. I own this DVD, and it gets worse every time I watch it. <br />The main problem with this movie is Anikin. Not only was he a bad actor, but his lines were a hideous attempt at trying to simulate a kid talking. Thus, for several scenes he stays in  his really serious &quot;I want to be a Jedi and free all the slaves&quot; additude, and then the lucasarts people realize &quot;Hey! he's supposed to be a child!&quot; And then he suddenly starts bouncing around saying &quot;yipeee!&quot; Anikin is what finally ruined the pod-race scene. <br />Bad movie aside, the DVD is poorly designed. All the menus are separated by unskippable 30-second long transitions that turn an already unpleasant movie experience into something not worth the excuse to eat popcorn. Don't waste your time here.
B000056K04|4.0|While this CD wasnt the greatest thing Dave has put out, It wasnt bad and a few of the songs had a hint of the &quot;old Dave&quot;.  I've been a Dave fan for about 5 years now (since I was 10) and he will ALWAYS be my favorite. If your looking for another &quot;Under the Table&quot;...this definitely isnt it, but if your a hardcore DMB fan, atleast buy the CD. I guarantee that despite the different music you'll come to like it anyhow. (And yes, I agree Lillywhite Sessions was a far better CD, but I back DMB's decision 100%.)
B00004STUL|1.0|This is a terrible moive. The plot is not involving, the premise is very poor, and the acting is sub-par. There are so many holes in the plot I can't even enumerate them; why not _interview_ the witness? She's been browsing the rogues' gallery on your computer, so why not just have her hook you up with an ID?<br />The writing is terrible. The jokes are obvious and not funny. The plot drags.<br />The stunts are neat and the picture is very good; I enjoy the 16:9 apsect ratio. The sound production was great, too. But the content needs more than polished production.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|If you don't own this album, you must have already heard it without knowing it.  Five or six songs in it are absolutely popular hits the kind you cant avoid to love.  They alone are worth the buy.  Besides them there are other pretty awesome songs the kind you hear once in a disco, in a movie or tv show and that you can't get off your mind for the next few days (and that make you pull your hear off 'cos you wanna know its name and who on earth plays it)<br />For cheap buyers (like myself) that only want compilations and \\"the best of\\" albums, I can assure this album is good enough to fit these expectations. So buy it, the price makes it a good deal, also.
B00002Z88D|5.0|Oh wow. Don't listen to those who'll tell you this is a sellout. We've seen it before cynical money-spinning live/greatest hits albums to keep the fans on the hook in between studio albums and at first sight that's how this looks. But this takes live to a whole new level. It's not even an original idea combining classical with rock but they pull it off brilliantly. Michael Kamen's orchestrations add whole new dimensions to old favourites such as `Master of Puppets' and 'Battery' without drowning or overshadowing them. The orchestra enhances and complements so beautifully it's like it's always been there or was always intended to be there. I'm a classical buff as well as a metalhead so this is like having all my favourite centres in one box of chocolates. I fell in love all over again with `Bleeding Me' and 'For Whom the Bell Tolls'. `The Memory Remains' - this version is so good I didn't even miss the Faithfull vocals. `No Leaf Clover' one of two previously unheard tracks ( 'Human' being the other and not bad either) is a powerful yet hauntingly lyrical added bonus. `Devil's Dance' one of my all time favourites is as good here as the original on Reload - Hetfield's vocals just get dirtier and grittier without him ever falling into the Lemmy/ Motorhead trap of sounding as though someone is trying too hard. And for once it doesn't matter that Ulrich gives it a bit too much on drums - even he can't upstage a full symphony orchestra. And I've thought this before but it should be said Jason Newsted might just possibly be the most underrated bassist in the history of rock music - he is damned good.
0425170349|4.0|This is the only Clancy book that I've actually read, so I can't compare it to any other ones.  I also can't make any comparison to other works with John Clark, because I've only seen movies with Jack Ryan.  Although, Clark and Chavez appeared in the movie (and book as I'm told) Clear and Present Danger, but their characters were butchered.  Anyway, the story goes that Clark and his son-in-law Ding Chavez have been comissioned to start Rainbow, an international anti-terrorist group.  They go around the world stopping terrorist acts, while a secret organization is planning to release a poisoned gas at the Sydney Olympics.  The terrorist battle scenes are great, but the non-action scenes, while necessary, are a little boring at the beginning, but they begin to gain excitement towards the end.  That's another problem though.  The book is almost 900 pages!  It takes a long time to get to the end!  If you love Clancy's other books, you'll probably like this, but if you don't like books that force you to use your brain, you may want to steer clear of this one.
0805062971|5.0|After watching such a great movie I became interested in what the book was like, wow as always...it was better than the movie.  Now I want to read all of Mr. Palaniuck's books. I just read this last week, so this week I bought Invisible Monsters, hope it's good to, and so far it's even better.  Amazing book and from what I have read, an amazing author.
B00005ATQD|1.0|OK, maybe because i am 18 is the reason why i dont understand the movie. But, i have watched this movie at least 4 times i STILL DONT GET IT.. please someone explain the plot and the whole point of the movie because all it looks like to me is a movie with alot of naked girls in it.....Why is it that at the end of the movie Nicole Kidman told Tom Cruise that they had one more thing to do ...
B000000WA4|5.0|Many Pumpkins enthusiasts would deem Mellon Collie the quintessential Smashing Pumpkins album, and I might have to agree with them...on the front that there is so much material (28 songs in whole). Corgan and his crew of not-so-merry men and D'Arcy were extremely ambitious to release a double album, but may have gone slightly overboard. Like many a double album before it (Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' and The Cure's 'Kiss Me') some songs are absolutely marvelous, while others could have easily been b-sides or left on the cutting room floor. Cuts such as the glorious 'Tonight, Tonight,' the angsty 'Zero' and 'Bodies' and the slow rocker 'Here Is No Why' are great examples of rockin' Pumpkins. '1979,'Thru The Eyes Or Ruby' and 'By Starlight' and 'Galapagos' are soft and mellow, and by all means, genius. Other songs don't exactly fare quite as well 'Tales Of A Scorched Earth' anyone? How about 'We Only Come Out At Night?' Some of the songs aren't exactly bad or even unlistenable, but they seem to be there just to make the album look bigger. I almost gave this album a 4-star rating, but the good material is just TOO GOOD to let a few clunkers bring it down. Behold one of the best albums of the 90's and one of the most ambitious albums of all time.
0385505833|5.0|What a great change of pace from John Grisham!  I flew through the book in just 2 days!  It was a delightful read.  Very funny!<br />I was so disappointed when I finished because it was sooo much fun! Thanks, John!  Keep the hits coming!
B00005OM4N|5.0|In my opinion, Britney's albums keep getting better and better as she matures.  This one is a great listen, and is well worth it.  There are a great many of catchy dance tracks.  The only ballad on the CD is \\"Not a Girl, Not Yet A Woman,\\" which really shows Britney's vocal range.  I think her singing has improved on this album too, she doesn't sound so nasally.
6304806434|4.0|It's explosive and funny. I really liked this one. Definetely recommended along with these: Broken Arrow, The World Is Not Enough(007, James Bond), Face/Off, The Rock, Terminator 2 and the 1st, just for some of the action lovers, great movies, I thought the Matrix was the worst film of 1999(not counting Titanic), whoever said that was good, give me a break! But let's get back to ConAir, it's awesome and fun. two simple words, k. Cage serves his time in prison for 10 years then gets stuck going home with convicted murderers who seize control of the plane, taking all the officers hostages, and killing the pilots, one of the major criminals is Malcovich and the other is Ving Rhaemes(also in Entrapment, Out Of Sight and Pulp Fiction). John Cusak is an officer. Good movie and full of entertainment, TWO THUMBS UP!!!! Not the greatest though, but good!
0446310786|5.0|If you CAN'T really judge the value of the book, don't dare read it. The ministry of education made a bad, bad choice of making not-so-intelligent average high school students to read this significant, profound, and well-praised bestseller in history (yes, it sells more than any other books in the world, perhaps only surpassed by the Bible.) It's way more than just another hackneyed civil rights book, it's more than an &quot;infantile&quot; (maybe the person who said this was infantile either slept all the way through his or her English classe&quot;S&quot; or didn't have any extra memory in his or her brain to process the fact that a child's point of view was deliberately used to illustrate the point.)plotline, it's indescribably brilliant and skillful in presentation. READ READ READ and buy and come back here and add more star to the review page of this book so that it counters the effect of star 1 or 2 of some dense readers .
B000067FP8|4.0|I am a huge fan of Gremlins.  I have owned the first one on DVD for several months now and can't get enough.  I have been looking for Gremlins 2 on DVD for quite some time and was very mad when I couldn't find it in any stores.  Finally it will be released August 20th and I will be able own my own copy of the movie.  So to summarize, this is a great movie and definitely better than the first.  It is definiely worth the wait.
0792156684|3.0|Let me start off by saying this, Titanic is a WONDERFUL MOVIE! It is one of those very few movies that I can watch, over and over again, and never get bored. The sinking scenes make you feel as though you are there. The chemistry between the two characters (Jack and Rose) is breath-taking.  But, my question is, where on earth are the extras??? The reason I give this DVD a three, is because of the MAJOR LACK of extras.  This movie was named \\"The Most Popular Movie Of All Time.\\"  Or so the back cover of the movie says.  So why aren't there any deleted scenes?  Where is the \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" music video by Celine Dion?  Where is the blooper real?  Can we ask for some interviews with the cast and crew? Or maybe some Behind The Scenes Footage? How about a director's commentary? The ONLY extra on this DVD, is the theatrical trailer. Not very impressive for the movie that grossed the most money at the box office in history.
020530902X|4.0|I first became aware of Strunk and White when a college professor included it in the list of books required for a writing class. I tossed the book into my closet and forgot about it until recently, after I handed in a few papers that I felt were not up to my standards.<br />Strunk and White is a quick read. What the book does is present the basics of English grammar and style in a way that anyone who wants to may improve their writing skills. I know I have several writing problems that need attention. I like to write in the passive voice when I should write in the active. I also like to add superfluous words when none are needed. Many of the words Strunk lists in his book are some of my favorites: as to whether, kind of/sort of, certainly, importantly, and many more. Strunk even attacks the use of the word very. It's going to be awhile before I can get that one out of my papers. Other helpful sections deal with commas, semicolons, and quotations.<br />I think an effective way to use this book is to just write a paper, mistakes and all, and then go back and see what needs to be changed. You'll drive yourself nuts if you try to change your writing as you go along. Change rarely occurs overnight, especially with a habit as deeply ingrained as bad writing style. I've had professors who claim the word but must never go at the beginning of a sentence. In other words, many highly educated people have no better grasp of grammar than the average person. Buy this book and show them up!
6305949980|5.0|Look, Zero!  A wonderful Christmas film, brought to you by the Pumpkin King of Hallowe'en Town!<br />I love Hallowe'en, and I love Christmas.  I wasn't sure the two moods could be successfully mixed, but Burton does it with his wonderful story and loveable characters.  Cute little touches everywhere.  Beautifully done.<br />Be sure to visit Disneyland's Haunted Mansion Holiday overlay, a wonderful tribute to this great film!
B00005RJ1U|4.0|I really think that this movie is good for the beginning and middle, but towards the end it gets too predictable.<BR>  The movie has a OK plot but it gets stuck between 2 plots and goes back and forth so you really don't know the story.<BR>  The brother and sister are really good actors and their exspressions are ones that a blind man could see.I'll give it a 4.

0380817683|5.0|In preparation for a trip to Ireland, I picked up Rachel's Holiday in order to read some contemporary Irish fiction.  I had previously read Sushi for Beginners, another Keyes novel and I was not extraordinarily impressed.  I was told Rachel's Holiday was a more profound novel, and I was not disappointed. <br />Through the depths of drug addiction and beyond, Keyes shows us the extraordinary talent she posseses in character development.  Where Sushi for Beginners is slightly lacking in character development, Rachel's Holiday is not.  Keyes forms a character that is unforgettable in Rachel.  Her incredible ability to create a setting without stating it bluntly is unsurpassed in chick lit particularly.  While many novels of this mode simply create a single-edged, hollow character, Keyes creates a person in Rachel's Holiday.<br />In a novel about friends, courage, addiction and recovery, Keyes explores the darker side of the chick lit genre.  Her novel doesn't gaily overlook the addictions and psychosis of her main character, she delves into the problems with conviction.  You will follow Rachel in all her delusions through many phases of her life.  <br />This coming of age story is one for the chick lit generation.  It is a beautiful novel, truly inspiring and filled with gifted prose.  You will laugh, you will cry, you will question, and you will love all in one novel--- don't pass this one up.<br />5/12/02

B000000W5B|4.0|Sounds like a booze, drugs and shagfest in the West Indies which is essentially what it is and like all good booze, drugs and shagfests it has moments of subliminal pleasure ( ' Winter ' ' Angie ' ), raw energy, <BR>( ' Dancing ..'

B00000251K|3.0|Many people peg \\"Glass Houses\\" as the first real album where Billy Joel rocks out without constraints. Wrong! \\"Piano Man\\" is a true rocker. It is also a very dark album: every societal deprivation is presented here: loneliness, ostracization, drinking binges, stress of the workplace, lost love, divorce, masturbation, sexual deviancy, and hard drug abuse. Serious stuff.<br />The first two tracks betray this gloomy album. \\"Travellin' Prayer\\" is an upbeat song, about protecting one's love against her travelling adventures. \\"Piano Man\\" is the title track that established Joel as a major songwriter, constantly overplayed on classic-rock radio, recollecting the experience and even some of the characters he remembered from his six months as a lounge lizard pianist in a Los Angeles dive. They seemed to have fueled the fire for the rest of the album.<br />Joel takes another mellow break with the lovely and hopeful ballad \\"You're My Home,\\" the other well-known song besides \\"Piano Man\\" itself. But then Joel launches into one frustrated tirade after another: \\"Ain't No Crime,\\" \\"Worse Comes to Worst,\\" \\"Stop in Nevada,\\" \\"Somewhere Along the Line,\\" and the unforgettable \\"Captain Jack,\\" the musical equivalent of arson, deliberately burning every human emotion in its path. This is a low as Billy gets. It's a powerful song that was humorously -- and stupidly -- played at a Hillary Clinton for Senate fundraiser. By the end of the album, if it's not evident that Billy Joel is suffering from a nervous breakdown, you soon will.<br />This is why I can't understand those who would classify this album in the soft-rock category, \\"Piano Man\\" and \\"You're My Home\\" notwithstanding. <br />Don't be misled, Billy rocks out on this album in total [ticked]-off fashion and leaves us with frazzled nerves. But it's a classic and needs to be in your collection. This album contains some truly brilliant songwriting with some real rock riffs and tasty country-style steel guitar riffs along with Joel's trademark piano chords. Just listen to it in when an upbeat mood. Listening to it when you're depressed should be illegal.
B00005QDW5|3.0|I'm not a fan of &quot;Best Of&quot; or greatest hits CDs, but I bought this one anyway because I really like Floyd, and this is as good as any excuse to listen to some really great music. I was really surprised at how they chopped seven minutes out of &quot;Echoes&quot; withou me noticing it (I thought I had that song memorized backwards and forwards). I still haven't figured out where the edits are. But I don't care for the amount of earlier Barrett-era stuff they put on the disc, though. It sounds so much different from the later Floyd sound, and it's not musically equivalent with such songs as &quot;Shine on you..&quot; or &quot;Echoes&quot;. I wouldn't call it &quot;Best of&quot; material.<BR>Also I don't like the inclusion of &quot;Shine on you crazy Diamond&quot;. I LOVE this song, but it doesn't work without the rest of the album between the two sections of the song. So I think it would've been better to leave this song off, even though it is SO good.<BR>But what the hey - I just skip the Barrett songs, and at the end of Disc one I switch over to &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;. Go ahead and buy it. Floyd music is so good anyway. Also it's neat to try to find the oblique references to previous PF album covers on the front of this one's booklet.

There is no man on earth to whom anyone has the right to play games like that. This is no game - this is brainwashing, breaking the rules, hurting human dignity. No man on earth has the right to do things like these to another - no matter how evil the man should be: God has meant men to be free to decide wether to be good or to be bad. This freedom cannot and MUST not been taken away by man.

B00003CXXO|5.0|I thought this movie was amazing and ahead of its time. When the movie came out people seems to think and expect too much from the movie. I think people and the critic had already set the movie on such high standards before it came out the theater since it was directed by Steven Speilberge, so when it was something they did not expect it dissapointed everyone. We should all be going to the movie with open mind and an imagination of posibilities of what future would be. This is a MOVIE! that's all it is. You have to admire the beauty of creating the picture, acting and posibilities for imaginations and not take it personally specially STOP EXPECTING TOO MUCH! When I went in to see A.I. I could not wait for it come out on the video and buy it. I have come to admire the special effects, the acting of William Hurt and Joel Osment this kid is one good actor. I like the idea in the future that all mankind will extinc<BR>so other life form can evolve, the evolution process in this planet happends all the time. With this movie I can imagine future evolutions and beauty in changes. This movie made think with all the technology we have now, how far will our capabilities as humans will go in the future? How far will we abuse the intelligence we have as humans in the future?<BR>can we learn now of our mistake and learn to practice prevention? I highly recommend this movie for someone who has the challenge for imagination. ENJOY!
0385503954|3.0|Think E.M. Forster meets Kazuo Ishiguro meets Stephen Spender meets \\"Upstairs, Downstairs.\\"  We have class conflict, world war ending a whole way of life, tragic circumstance, and a young potentially brilliant life gone terribly awry because of secrets.  We also have prose that reads at first like it's precise and necessary but ends up as the opposite.  There's a huge amount of detail, and it's well-observed and written, but it feels...random, like the writer was trying to decide what to talk about and just wandered around a little until he settled down.<br />And it doesn't mesh.  I kept thinking it was like two or three shorter pieces cut together -- \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" and \\"The English Patient\\" -- unrelated in mood or voice or theme, except for the era, like a movie that changes scriptwrites or directors a couple times during production, only they're good writers and directors, so although the movie as a whole isn't anything new, there are individual scenes that really work.<br />And then there's the lame metafictional ending.  Why do so many writers write about writing?  Why whack the reader over the head with the notion that he's reading something?  It makes me feel like I'm being messed with -- which is acceptable if that's what I'm expecting, or if the radically altered expectations makes me see things in a different way.  I couldn't figure out the point here.  It's not always productive to guess why a writer writes what he does, but I did wonder if he ended it this way because he didn't really trust his work, didn't think what he'd done was enough, that it could be rescued and made meaningful with a tricky finish.  Like those B-movies where you think it's over but then the monster bursts out of the grave, the surprise doesn't save it.  I wanted to like this one: it should have been fine, it should have meant something, only it didn't.
B00005JKCF|4.0|Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is a movie which may actually appeal more to casual fans of Spider-Man, than fans of the comic book. While writing this review I thought of casual and hardcore fans, though I did not think of non-fans. I mean, no one will accidentally walk into the Spider-Man movie. <br />The movie follows the earlier legend of Spider-Man rather than the revised story of the Ultimate Spider-Man comic books. However the storyline the Spider-Man movie follows, follows well, and establishes the origin story of Spider-Man very faithfully to the comic books. Toby Maguire is excellent as Peter Parker, and is very convincing as a young man coming to terms with his superpowers. Kirsten Dunst is also quite good in her role as Mary Jane, while Willem Dafoe is quite a good Norm Osborn. However the best acting performance came from J.K. Simmons as J. Joanah Jameson, who is quite hilarious in his performance. <br />The script is also well written; at times very funny and at other times very touching. When it comes to establishing Peter Parker and Norm Osborn, the Spider-Man movie succeeds fantastically. It is amazingly touching and its characters feel surprisingly human. However when it comes to establishing the character of Spider-Man, the movie falters a bit. Spider-Man in his costume never feels joyful or at all like the smart mouthed Spidey we know. Unfortunately he hardly speaks, and is far too mysterious. I mean this attitude is great for someone like Batman, but certainly not suited to Spider-Man. Any fan of Spider-Man knows that Spidey is full of one-liners and wisecracks. Unfortunately in the movie, Spider-Man is too quiet and believes in action rather than words.<br />I must admit to the fact that the special affects are fantastic. And even though the joy of being Spider-Man is never fully established through dialogue it is thoroughly established through action. Spider-Man looks fantastic swinging past fast moving vehicles, and doing Matrix like moves. The sceneswhere he utilizes his abilities, are especially well done. All in all the Spider-Man movie is a visual feat, and its unmasked characters are extremely well developed. <br />If I compare it to other superhero movies, I'd put this one behind the Superman and Batman movies. What those movies had though, was a great soundtrack, which the Spider-Man movie sorely misses. Also, those movies' superheroes had a lot of heart when they were in their costumes, while Spider-Man seems too robotic, much like Al-Gore. Like Batman, Superman, and The X-Men movies, Spider-Man does a good job when it comes to the character development of its unmasked hero. In fact I'd take it a step further, and say that Peter Parker is as well developed as Clark Kent was. Unfortunately as Spider-Man, he is more like Al-Gore than Spider-Man. Perhaps the problem was that Peter Parker was still new to being Spider-Man, and had not yet developed his Spider-Man personality. I think that that was the movie's only problem, it's Peter Parker lacked character when he put on the Spider-Man suit. <br />I don't want to close on a negative though. The Spider-Man movie is quite good. It features some good character development, some superb action, witty dialogue (from everyone except for the webslinger), and great direction. This movie will do for superhero fans, what the original Superman movies did.
B00005JKCF|5.0|<BR><BR>Those of us whose childhood fantasies were fed by superhero comic books -- instead of television -- always looked forward to superhero movies, and often came out of the theater disappointed; but not this time. Sam Rami succeeded where generations of directors and endless, like-minded TV series often failed. He found and inflamed the dormant desire for awe in admiration of the strong, yet tender, heroic male; the one we read about in adolescence, and whom we secretly kept close to our hearts as adults.<BR><BR>Yet this is not a nostalgic movie with old fashions or a middle-aged audience in mind. It is as fresh as a teenager movie and as action packed as any Hollywood blockbuster, while at the same time it is an excellent film in every respect. It is exciting, funny, touching and perfectly paced. In other words it is great adventure entertainment, and I highly recommend it.<BR><BR>I will not go into the details of the story, one that, after all, is not so different from others, in order to not spoil it for those who have not seen it.<BR><BR>I do want to single out Alvin Sargent, a seasoned screenwriter, and his team, for writing a script that makes characters interesting, believable and sympathetic. The action is measured, the suspense is tolerable and the plot is interesting, tight and unburdensome. No superfluous talking here. No long-winded car chases or overly brutal fights. In fact, I was glad to see one of the criminals fall by accident, rather than to be killed by such a gentle superhero.<BR><BR>Tobey Maguire, whose memorable performance in \\"The Cider House Rules\\" propelled him to super stardom, is the surprising and fortunate casting choice for the role of Peter Parker, the high school boy turned Spider-man. He gives a sensitive rendering of a young man who, having been bitten by a genetically modified spider, develops superhuman abilities. His portrayal of this dual, human and supernatural character is not only convincing, but given the actor's own likable personal traits, it is very sweet and moving as well.<BR><BR>Kirsten Dunst in the role of Mary Jane is as likeable as Maguire, and well cast as Spider-man's long - and widely -- sought after sweetheart.<BR><BR>The villainous character's incarnation, in a subplot that involves the US Dept. of Defense, is unexpected, spectacular and amusing. It adds just enough spice to an otherwise predictable outcome.<BR><BR>The manner of updating the decades old context of Spider-Man is inspired, and it includes a lot more than biologically re-engineered arachnoids. One of my favorites was WWF wrestling as his first proving ground. This, and many other aspects of the movie will endear it to young viewers. (Never the less, keeping in mind its 2-hour length and some violence, I would not recommend it for young children.)<BR><BR>\\"Spider-Man\\" is a feast for the eyes. The producers' choice of locations, colors, special effects, costumes, and even make up, deliver a hint of comic-book sketching, just enough to make us surrender to the screen, only without any of the gaudiness or spooky retrofuturist gimmicks that would easily turn off sophisticated audiences. The hero's aerial acrobatics are, as one would expect, more fantastic than those of Olympic gymnasts, but delivered with the smooth interpretation and subtle touches of skillful choreography. And behind all this we see New York in all it's earthly glory, as if the choice of Manhattan for the film's backdrop was intended to present this legendary city of ours from the perspective of a box seat in one of its great venues for the performing arts.
B0000029DD|5.0|This CD is one of the most beautifully produced, beautifully sung CD's I've ever heard.  The painstaking care that went into picking each of the tracks is evident.  The care that went into MAKING each of the tracks is evident.  Jeff's voice is ethereal and organic all at the same time.  The bass line in most of the tracks is unique and just plain fun to listen to.<br />You won't be disappointed if you buy this CD.  The best money I've spent on music in a long while.

6300214559|4.0|This gem of a film is from Helena Bonham-Carter's ingenue days in which she captures the strength of the pious and studious Nine-Days Queen magnificently. Strangely, paintings show she bears a stronger resemblance to Guildford Dudley than Cary Elwes, who makes up for his lack of physical resemblance to Jane's slovenly, disreputable husband by turning out a charismatic and thoughtful performance.<BR> This rather heavy-handed account of Jane Grey's life has a lot of symbolism. In a very English hunting scene at the beginning (which closely resembles a Breughel painting), we see the elders in Jane's life closing in on a deer in much the same way they would trap Jane into serving their own corrupt ends. After Jane is whipped by her mother for her reluctance to marry the obnoxious Guildford Dudley, King Edward comforts her by giving her a puppet to play with. The symbolism of that moment at this point in the film is blantantly obvious.<BR> Michael Hordern's Father Fekenham is a comforting presence in Jane's life, despite their disagreements over religion. He never hides the amount of respect he has for the young girl.<BR> Inaccuracies of the film include the fact that Jane's parents, played by a hard-driven Patrick Stewart, and a ruthless Sarah Kestelman(who reaffirms the fact that the saintliness of Frances Grey's mother, Mary, who was Henry VIII's younger sister, truly skipped a generation)responded to Jane's initial refusal to marry Guildford by respectively slapping her in the face repeatedly and cursing her. While one is greatful that the audience is spared that, the nude scene between Jane and Guildford was a bit gratuitous, and as Jane was actually unwavering in her resentment of her chosen husband, it's highly unlikely that their union was consumated. But the earlier wedding scene was indeed, a phantasmagoria of white and gold, and beautiful to watch.<BR> After her scheming elders place her on the throne, there is no evidence that Jane became, as Americans mightsay, a forerunner to FDR. She took to her bed, grief-stricken over the loss of King Edward.There is some truth to Guildford's having provided some comfort to her at this time, and part of the dialogue that is heard in the initial coronation scene is based on historical fact. <BR> As Jane's Governess, Mrs. Ellen,played by Jill Bennett, stands by, a helpless witness to her brilliant charge's fate, Jane Lapotaire's gracefully portrayed Mary reclaims her throne, Henry Grey tears down the royal canopy, and all the conspirators, reluctant or otherwise, are placed under arrest. Jane bears these indignities, as she has many others throughout her life, with a courage and patience well beyond her years. John Dudley becomes a turncoat, deciding to return to Catholicism to save himself, much to the dismay of Guildford. But this scheme doesn't work. Jane and Guildford almost escape with their lives, until Henry Grey joins a rebellion to restore Jane to the throne.<BR> Certain scenes of Jane's final days in the tower were given better treatment in the 1936 film, \\" Nine Days A Queen\\", starring Nova Pilbeam, and John Mills. But in the scenes of Jane on the scaffold are, for the most part, well-reenacted in this film. The sense of sorrow witnesses have at the brutal death that is to be faced by a girl so young, so brilliant, so sweet, and so innocent is almost beyond expession. Even Queen Mary (I hesitate to call her \\"Bloody Mary\\" when her father killed more people and has more flattering nicknames ascribed to him only because he had better P.R.)must have sensed that hers would not be a blessed reign as a result of her having to execute her own cousin in order to marry a Spanish King and restore England to Catholicism.<BR> Frances Brandon Grey is shown curtseying to the Queen who has just executed her daughter and who would soon execute her husband. Ironically, she would become a court favorite with the Queen. But there is some sense of justice in the fact that history has not beenkind to Jane Grey's parents.<BR> Trevor Nunn has given the world a sharp, glistening, stately, and lavish production filled with a great sense of period and place. Whatever inconsistancies this film may have with history,its loving homage to Jane Grey is well-paid.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Ok, so let's start off by sayin that unlike other reviews of this record who quote wrong lyrics (i wanna have sex with u???) that I find this to be Britneys best album yet.  Obvious that she is now writin her own lyrics this album reminds me a lot of Janet Jackson's Control album.  \\"Anticipating\\" is the greatest song Britney has recorded to date and is unquestionably a summer anthem.  \\"Let Me Be\\" and \\"That's Where You Take Me\\" are great and never grow old.  The only disappointment with the U.S. release are the omittance of two tracks \\"Before The Goodbye\\" and \\"I Run Away\\".  I highly recommend this cd.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I had heard all the hype surrounding this CD for months before it's release, so I was unsure what to expect. Wow was I pleasantly surprised. Wilco has always had that quality about them that makes you sit back and think this is great music. Jeff Tweedy is really strong on this album, delivering so much feeling. It is often a cliche when discussing music but this album is truly a journey, best listened to from beginning to end. I couldn't recommend it enough!!
0446310786|5.0|Hi im Dan and im 15 years old.  I have just finished reading this book for my tenth grade english class.  I thought this book was a very good book.  I liked how this book relates to everyday life and even though this book was written many years ago, people still deal with the some of the same everyday issues that this book deals with.  This book dealt mainly with racism and although racism is still around us, alot of poeple have learned to look beyond the color of a persons skin.  I thought this was a well written book and would recommend this book to anyone.
B00005JL0I|4.0|Casino Royale is a fun, likable, and at times very funny film.  It is a parody of early James Bond movies.  Although this didn't get good reviews, fans of Peter Sellers will love it.  With 5 different directers (including Robert Parrish, director of Sellers' \\"The Bobo\\") this movie will have something in it for everyone.  The movie itself is over two hours long!  But it goes by fast.  Also, there is major 60's star-power including Ursula Andress, Orsen Welles, William Holden, Woody Allen, and one of the five directors, John Huston.  This film reunites Peter Sellers and David Niven who also starred in The Pink Panther together previously, and later came out with \\"Murder by Death\\" and \\"Trail of the Pink Panther.\\"  If you enjoyed \\"What's New, Pussycat?,\\" chances are you'll enjoy this, too.  Although this film was Not Rated by the MPAA, it would be the equivilent to a PG-13 for mild language, brief nudity, and a dreary plot.

B00005B36H|5.0|i read the other reviews placed on this cd.  in one it said that if you bought the album it would sit on your shelf collecting dust..  the only reason mine collects dust is i burned a second copy so i would not damage the original from using it all the time.  i absolutely love this cd, the song laterlis has to be my fav on the entire album, but there are a great number of good songs on here along with it.  i like the entire album.  true the songs are somewhat long but no where near as long as some of the other bands i listen to, so for me they are rather short for me.  if you are looking into getting this album know that yes some of the songs are considered long, but never dull.  again i say it is a masterful work from a very talented band.
B000063UR2|5.0|I have waited a long time for a proper presentation of this visually stunning film. The wait was worth it! This 2-disc set is why I love DVD! The new restored directors cut of this film makes this more than just a visually breathtaking movie, it delivers a film that changes the way you looked at it originally.<BR>Ridley Scott is one of those directors who is always trying to please everybody. Blade Runner was a perfect example. There has been so many cuts of this film. Under pressure from Hollywood execs and test screenings he had to dumb down the film and add narration from Harrison Ford to explain what is going on. Legend was a victim to test screenings also. The result was a hastily edited movie that lost a lot of the impact that this new directors cut has. The feel of the movie is changed right away by not showing Darkness.  In the U.S. cut the mystery and weight of the charcter is cut short by choosing to show him right away. All great movie villians are the ones in the shadows, lurking, planning, waiting for the right moment to reveal themselves. This sense of awe and mystery is given back to the character. Only showing his hand and keeping him in the shadows. Ominous dialog provided by Tim Curry makes this guy evil before you even see him. There are changes like this that makes this feel like an entirely different movie. The addition of Jerry Goldsmiths score also changes the feel and tone of this film. It loses the eerie feel of the score provided by Tangerine Dream, but gives it more of an epic quality. I know some people out there will miss the old score, but fear not. On disc 2 you have the original U.S. cut. The directors cut has a beautiful new anamorphic widescreen presentation and DTS and Dolby Digital sound. The new sound mix is awesome. Heavy bass extension and great use of surrounds which causes this movie to encompass you. Hearing Darkness speak and to feel it in your chest will give you goosebumbs. My only complaint is that the U.S. cut is in Dolby 2.0. As much as I like this new version I really enjoyed TD's trippy synth heavy score, and to not have it in DTS or Dolby Digital is a bummer. There are also tons of extra features to keep you busy. If you are at all a fan of DVD this movie should be in your collection.
0393317552|4.0|The other reviews thoroughly explain the premises of this book and expand on them quite well.  I would just like to mention that they forget the central theme and question jared diamond puts forth in the beginning of his argument.<br />The crux of his argument is this:  what are the ultimate causes that have led to the proximate causes of european dominance of the last 500 years?  First, a definition and derivation of proximate and ultimate causes:  proximate questions ask how does it work and ultimate questions ask why does it work.  Ethologists and animal behaviorists ask themselves these same questions in order to explain behavior displayed by animals in the wild.  This scientific approach is applicable to humans as well, since this subject at its very core is a question about human behavior.  <br />With regards to world history, jared diamond summarises the proximate causes as guns, germs and steel and suggests they are the mechanisms responsible for why europeans were able to conquer numerous peoples around the world with such apparent ease.  However, in his book he also sets out to find the ultimate causes as to why europeans were able to attain these mechanisms responsible for their conquests and why other peoples did not.   In order to explain these events without using unreliable social theories, he develops his hypothesis using irrefutable scientific evidence gathered from the fields of geography, biogeography, etc. to concisely explain the events of the past 10,000 years leading up to the european conquest and colonization of the world.  This approach offers a logical step-by-step explanation to help explain these momentous events in world history.  He does not say it is the be-all, end-all of explanations for the current outcome of world history.  He even admits the validity of other ideas and theories, including the idea that great people are major determinants of world history.  However, in response he says this:  there were perhaps other napoleans, julius caesars, charlemagnes, etc in other parts of the world in history, but without domesticatable plants and animals, tempramental climates, and favourable continental axis alignments to support beurocrats, standing armies, religious servants, merchants, tradesmen, artisans, et al. these people were too busy with day-to-day activites, such as procuring food, to conquer other nations.  Throughout the book he refutes or includes other arguments into his own and this is just an example of how he does it.  I know I'm missing a lot of points in between these ideas, but that's why you'll just have to read the book to decide for yourself.

0440539811|5.0|Illuminatus! is pershaps one of the most wonderful books I have ever read.  The combination of occultism, anarchism, and outright wierdness carries the reader through the most bizzare conspiracy theory ever dreamt of.  This book will make you laugh, rage, and probably cause you to become a bit paranoid.<br />   The story, or stories, hinge around a search for the truth about the Illuminati, a worldwide conspiracy that has apparently existed for centuries.  Wilson complied a great deal of information, as well as tid bits from letters sent to him by crazies when he was working as the letters editor at Playboy magazine.  The result is a book that leaves you wondering where fact ends and satire begins.  That is, of course, the point.  Wilson is out to blow your mind.  <br />   Professional cynics, who delight in nay-saying the creativity of others without producing anything of their own as an alternative, will find the book sentimental and a bit silly.  For those with truly open minds, however, the Illuminatus Trilogy will be a book to read many times over.  There is enough subtlety to keep you as busy as a thorough reading of Finnegan's Wake.  The hidden messages and allusions seem to multiply each time you read.<br />   You may even see the Fnords!
B000002H6C|5.0|Usually I don't review cds unless I have had them for a peroid<BR>of time, but this is probably one of metallicas best albums to <BR>date, second to master of puppets. This is raw,real, the way<BR>thrash metal should be.There are some really notible songs on<BR>here that will,have withstanded the test of time.You have songs<BR>like one,...and justice for all that really show the musician<BR>ship of metallica,and kirk hammet is one hell of a guitar player.<BR>And so is james. then you get into harvester of sorrow and live<BR>is to die. so if you want a raw,uncut thrash metal album, by all<BR>means get ...and justice for all.
B00005RFAI|5.0|If you are debating on whether or not to buy this CD, debate no longer. You have in front of your screen a great album. The songs are all original molds, not cookie-cutter [stuff...] The lyrics come from the heart, about family and her starting as an artist. Pink is developing more and more, and this is hopefully just the  beginning of more greatness. Consisting of  mostly rock listens, they really are ones you can listen to over and over and over and over. *Note: \\"18 Wheeler\\" is my favorite track. Unless you're reluctant to replace your favorite CD, buy Missundaztood immediately!!<BR>:)
B00005A46T|4.0|I have to say that I waited for this for 2 years, ever since I heard their (Roadrunner) debut. Because of Slipknot's 'Slipknot', they became my favorite band. But 'Iowa', is a different story. This album was so hyped, it was supposed to be death metal. It was supposed to rock your head till it fell off your...neck. 'Iowa' was none of those things. How can people say that this is death metal? The only people I know who really like this...think that they are metalheads because they have a Slipknot t-shirt. But when you talk to them about Rotting Christ, Napalm Death, Death, or any band of that nature, they will stare at you blankly. I am not saying that 'Iowa' completely [stunk], it does have its strong points. I mean...\\"Disasterpiece\\", \\"The Shape\\", and \\"I Am Hated\\" are pretty solid tracks. The drum work is still one of the best around. Lyrically, the album is very good...But songs like \\"The Heretic Anthem\\" and \\"Metabolic\\" are actually amazing. The guitar work, the vocals, the samples, everything on those two tracks kick... Don't get me wrong, all the songs are good, that is why I gave 'Iowa' 4 starss, but I am severely dissapointed with this one. There is no death, no hard, brutal, crushing riffs. It is not as good as it was thought to be. I don't have Slipknot, their (Roadrunner) debut has almost never left my C.D. player in the past 2 years. But maggots be warned: this is not the album it was said to be...
0399226907|5.0|This has been one of my son's favourite books since he received it at Christmas.  He is now 14 months old and just loves to turn the brightly coloured pages of this board book.  This book is sturdy!  A wonderful story of a caterpillar who keeps eating till he's huge and the ultimate ending of his becoming a beautiful butterfly.  Great little story!
B000002KOQ|5.0|If I could only have one Joni Mitchell album (a terrible dilemma), this would be it. While there may be more cohesive and mature albums in her collection, Ladies perhaps came closest to capturing the very essence of Joni's musical and lyrical magic.<br />Ladies Of The Canyon is an album of bright summer mornings and rainy afternoons, throughout which Joni's voice and piano are at their purest and most exquisite. Morning Morgantown, Conversation and Ladies Of The Canyon itself have a freshness and a mystique that an incredible 32 years have failed to diminish in any way.<br />The tour de force of the album is still Circle Game, which is a bitter-sweet song about individual life unfoldment, reincarnation and the eternal cycles of the Universe.<br />While Blue, For The Roses, Court, Lawns, you name it, are all truly brilliant albums, I feel that only her classic 'live' album Miles Of Aisles comes close to equalling the sheer magic of Ladies Of The Canyon.<br />Whatever it is that makes Joni Mitchell the divine enchantress she has always been is fully captured here on Ladies Of The Canyon and on Miles Of Aisles. <br />An outstanding album that will never fade.
0694003611|5.0|A wonderful little board book for young hands with a simple story line parents are familiar with ... the good night ritual.  Little bunny continues to say good night to EVERYTHING (including the moon) as mother bunny tries to get him to sleep.  A classic.
B0000035GN|5.0|Sebadoh's Bakesale is definitely one of the best albums of all time.  The band is unusually collabrative, pumping out a collection of songs that fit together so well it could almost be considered a concept album.  Just when you've had enough of Lou Barlow's sensitive whining, Jason Lowenstein takes over and pelts out one of his raucus tunes.  This is the most cohesive they ever sounded.  If you buy just one Sebadoh album get this one.
B00005YU1O|5.0|In some ways this film is a companion piece to Linklater's earlier film &quot;Before Sunrise.&quot;  In &quot;Before Sunrise,&quot; Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy wander around Vienna all night, having a philosophical discussion about life, the universe, and everything.  &quot;Waking Life&quot; is similar--basically its protagonist, played by Wiley Wiggins from &quot;Dazed and Confused,&quot; has encounters with a wide variety of unusual people, all of whom explain their personal philosphies to him.  The question is, how much of this is a dream, and how much is real?  Some of the characters in &quot;Waking Life&quot; are more interesting than others, but on the whole the format of the movie works very well with the amazing animation--live-action footage was drawn over and otherwise messed with to create a film with fascinating and varied visuals.  (How was this not nominated for the best animated film Oscar?  A travesty.)  I was especially happy that Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy appear again, picking up where they left off on a conversation from &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; whose implications have nagged at me since I first saw that film several years ago!  Everybody should see &quot;Waking Life,&quot; and while you're at it, see &quot;Tape&quot; as well--another strikingly original Linklater film released in 2001.
038533558X|5.0|I thought Harlan Coben had reached the top of his game with Tell No One, I was wrong. Gone For Good is easily the best book I have read this year. This book has it all, great chracters, a strong plot, supense, twists, suprise ending. I highly recommend Gone For Good
0060975768|5.0|This is undoubtedly one of the best books on warfare ever written.  It's a gripping, edge-of-the-seat narrative told in a style reminiscent of Ambrose, with heavy reliance on first-person recollections.   The book recounts the 1965 Ia Drang Battle, the first set-piece engagement between U.S. and NVA armies in battalion strength.<br />People who've seen the recent, excellent movie may think they know the tale.  But the movie tells only half the story, ending with the conclusion of hostilities at Landing Zone X-Ray.  Left undepicted by Hollywood is the ferocious fighting at Landing Zone Albany, where the U.S. 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry is ambushed and encircled by numerically superior NVA reserve forces.  The description of the LZ-Albany carnage and gallantry is some of the best writing on warfare I have ever encountered.<br />I was pleased to see that the movie (one of my favorites of recent vintage) raised public consciousness of the sacrifices and bravery of our Viet Nam servicemen.  The book makes the case even more poignantly.  Even unpopular wars produce heroes who serve with honor, courage and distinction.  My hat is off to all of them.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This album is great. Theres the pure Blink 182. Ok Chesire Cat was good but this...this rocks. Mark, Tom and Travis have all grown up a bit and wrote about really great songs. Adams song, wrote by Mark Hoppus about a boy who killed himself, is brilliant, the best lyrics I have ever seen from Blink and are likely ever to see and I quote, \\" I never thought I'd die aloan another 6 months, I'll be unknow, Give all my things to all my friends, your'll never set foot in my room again\\" Buy it, love it, play till the end of blink coz this will not get boring.
B00004Y6NK|3.0|I am not a typical Clapton fan. In fact, I will confess, this is the only cd of his that I own.<br />The lead off track It's In The Way That You Use It has to be the best songs Clapton has ever done. Much better than the extremely overplayed songs such as: Layla, Wonderful Tonight,etc....Rocking guitar solo with strong singing. To me it sounds like Clapton actually meant it in this song!<br />Hung Up On Your Love, Hold On, Holy Mother, and the extremely hypnotic majesty of Grand Illusion are the reasons this album is good. Now, don't get me wrong. I like 1980's music. However, some of the production does seem dated on this album. Besides the mentioned songs, there does not seem to be much here.<br />Little did I realize that Clapton (of course around a few years after I bought this cd) released another greatest hits collection covering from around after 1980 to around 1997. Too bad he did nto release it sooner as the lead off track is included on that as well. That may be my next purchase. Take my review with a grain of salt as I am only a casual fan at best. I would only recommend this after getting the greatest hits cd I mentioned. There does not seem to be much of Clapton's other music that I can recommend. Blues just does not inspire me the way that rock by the Beatles, Stones or Police does.
B00005R87Q|5.0|The Fast &amp; The Furious is a great movie to own. When you're having a party of have guests over just take it out and put it on when the party starts to be a drag. I highly reccomend this movie although the special features on the DVD are dissapointing they're pretty much useless after you look at them for the first time. Don't expect to be impressed by the special features. Very good movie though if you liked it this is a movie you'll probably watch more than just a few times.
B0000507PC|4.0|I read that novel a few years ago,and this film i beleive does it justice.The fact that the author himself did the adaptation to the screen helps a lot;after all it is his baby.Previous adaptations of JOHN IRVING'S books(THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP and THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSHIRE(a mess))were not of the same quality.There are however two points i want to single out here:the fact that HOMER can practice medecine with a fake diploma is rather hard to take;it is also never explain to us why the doc(MICHAEL CAINE)always needs ether to find some sleep.Is he a drug addict?Personnaly,i would have cut the episode of the black man having made his own daughter pregnant,but it helps us to understand that HOMER has not lost what he had learned before.
0375703861|5.0|To call Zadie Smith's maiden effort a promising debut is calling the extraordinary mundane. I was blown away by the breath of her knowledge, insight and maturity and how she gives a voice to the multi-culti experiments that shape the streets of cosmopolitan cities these days from London to Delhi. She does an excellent job of blending the various foibles of her protaganists with the tides of the times and I loved how sympathetic she seemed to even  her least likable characters. The caricatures are loving yet fierce and the character development is totally believable. I know of no other recent work of fiction that sings so loudly the tune: we are all in this together and all niches of obsession are temporary shelter.
B00005YXZH|5.0|There are some great pop songs on Yankee Hotel Foxtrot but that's just the beginning. DO NOT give up on this album after the first listen or the second or the third. There are so many levels to YHF. It is a complete album that needs to be absorbed into you conscience..like Pet Sounds and Sgt. Peppers before it. This album will one day be remembered as one of the greatest releases of the 21st century. WOW!!
B0000639FE|5.0|Jerry Maguire is Cameron Crowes best film to date.  I know I am not alone when I say it is and always will be one of Hollywood's all time greats.  <br />With regard to the DVD, all I can say is thank god I waited.<br />Sony has done Jerry Maguire proud. This 2-disc edition is stacked with extras and is packaged exceptionally well, but the real highlight is the fantastic full length video-commentary on disc two.  A hearty thanks to Tom, Cameron, Cuba and Renee for coming back to do that, as it makes this DVD one of the best ever made.  <br />More producers of DVD's should take this as an example of how to do things right.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Just saw the movie this weekend and I was really surprised at how good it turned out. The special effects were great and the storyline seemed to stay true to the Spiderman storyline. I use to watch the cartoon version of spiderman that came on the Fox Network on Saturdays and was big a fan. I have to admit though, when i went to go see it with a few of my older brothers I wasn't expecting it to be that good.  But the movie definetely surprised me. The ending even got a little intense too. Hobgob was really kicking Spidey's [butt]! A lot of my friends said they didn't like the way the movie ended, but i did. It's totally setting you up for the next sequel (which there will be). Besides that when have you ever known any superhero to get the girl right off the bat. Superman and Lois Lane eventually got married but not after going through a bunch of strife. The same goes for MJ and Spidey. And anyway it'll just make when they finally do get together all the more sweeter. Definetely check this movie out. It's well worth your ...bucks to go see it in the theater.
B000000HTK|4.0|\\"Godbluff\\" is VDGG's first in a trilogy of 1975/1976 \\"come-back\\" albums (followed by \\"Still Life\\" and \\"World Record\\"). There are only 4 tracks, each at about 9 min. and while these days a 37 min. album is inexusable, in the 1975 vinyl era, things were different.<br />\\"The Undercover Man\\" starts off in a hush-like atmosphere of Hammill's voice and Jackson's flute, eventually rounding out to the full classic line-up with Evans (on drums) and Banton (on keyboards). \\"Scortched Earth\\" is more urgent in sound, and more complex; with Banton on the forefront, it reminds me of early Genesis. \\"Arrow\\" is the most \\"experimental\\" track of the album, but quite good. The album-ending \\"The Sleepwalkers\\" is the true gem of the album, finding the band's sound focust and tight, if not melodic.<br />\\"Godbluff\\" is IMHO the most accessible of the 3 come-back albums, and a great introduction to VDGG. Too bad we are still waiting for remastered editions of all of them, because the sound is a bit dull. As far as the music goes, this is prime!
B000002NC4|5.0|Every thousand years, a band this talented makes it just below the mainstream radar. Every thousand years you hear a record that is this well thought out, performed and written. Thankfully most of the time it's out of site. Thankfully, I have discovered built to spill, and I like many others, don't know how I listened to music before or how their impact has affected the way I will listen from now on.
0385721234|5.0|Like Water for Chocolate, written by Laura Esquivel, is evidence that love has many obstacles. The story takes place in a ranch located in Mexico where a house full of women live. Mama Elena and her three daughters, Rosaura, the oldest, Gertrudis, and Tita, the youngest, are the women of that ranch. The book revolves around Tita and her true love Pedro. Tita, being the youngest, has to take care of her mother until the day her mother died because it was a family tradition. Therefore, Mama Elena forbids Pedro from taking Tita's hand in marriage but offered him to take Rosaura's hand instead. So Pedro marries Rosaura so he can be close to Tita. Tita not knowing his intention for marrying his sister, became very upset and sad but she had to hide her true feelings so Mama Elena wouldn't be angry with her. This was a struggle for both Tita and Pedro because they really loved each other. As days went by, Mama Elena kept a close eye on Tita and Pedro. Then one day, she told Pedro that he, Rosaura, and their baby had to move to Texas because she had a feeling that Tita and Pedro were having a secret affair. Tita felt like her life was going to end because she loved Pedro so and she was attached to Roberto. She also couldn't take losing Pedro for the second time. Years past and Tita felt something different for someone different. She and John, the doctor, became close and were soon engaged. Pedro became angry at the fact that Tita was going to marry someone that wasn't him and began to have tantrums. Tita didn't like what Pedro was doing but his actions gave her a sudden dose of reality. She realized that she had to choose who she wanted to be with and that decision was easy because of the love she felt when he was around. So with that feeling inside of her, she chooses Pedro, her true love and they become one. This book is full of tears and obstacles that are overcome by Tita and Pedro's love for one another.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Nora Jones has a voice that just melts the heart. It is as sweet as a Godiva Chocolate.  Her voice is, to this reviewer, strangely reminisent of the 1970's singer Maria Muldar:  soft and light. <br />This daughter of sitar and Indian music expert Ravi Shankar has clearly learned the art of working the words of a tune.  Who would have thought that the Hank Williams tune &quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot; could ever sound right without a nasal twang?  Jones has taken the song in a whole different direction...and done so with grace.<br />This is a woderful and delightful work.  Hopefully there will be many more releases from this talented performer.
B000063UR2|5.0|Always put off buying this 80's sleeper gem, and for good reason. This is so truly the ultimate edition! Worth 10X the price I paid. The film itself brings to life a mythical world only recently touched on with LOTR. The make-up was top notch and facinating for its and any time to date. In fact, it's that organic presence of its characters that is lacking in the new Star Wars films! The Making Of feature is in-depth and includes interviews with all but Tom Cruise on how \\"legendary\\" the film was for them to make. Seeing Tim Curry  and Mia Sara was an added plus. Highly recommend it!!
B00000ILDE|4.0|Ripley comes back with the cat that made it through the first film, and is pronounced negligent for destroying the company ship. License revoked and no longer in her own time, several decades have past while she was frozen, she remains on the space station to work as a forklifter. A colony on the planet where her past crew met their demise has not been responding to the companies calls. Solution? Oh,yeah... you guessed it. Their solution is to send a recon mission with Ripley as their advisor. Why would she do this? Right again. To get back her flying license and return to active duty as an officer.  Well, heres where it gets interesting. Ripley is traveling with young, over zealous officers who show very little respect for their commander.  Of course there is droid on board who Ripley is instantly weary of to the point of threatening him to watch his back.  Once they arrive on the planet, they discover that the only survivor is a little girl. Ripley takes the little girl under her wing and soon they have a strong bond of friendship. In true Alien style, the crew slowly start to dwindle in numbers, the fuel is low, and the commander is killed leaving Ripley and a Corporal as highest ranking officers. It's a fight to the death to escape the clutches of the alien and her nesting ground. Add betrayal, friendship, a spark of sexual attraction, not to mention the action pack sequences and this film packs a powerful and gripping punch.
B00005JKL8|5.0|I didn't get a chance to see this movie in theaters, but the instant it came out on VHS and DVD I rented it. The performances by Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman are great. Wilson plays an Air Force pilot who is shot down while on a recon mission. Wilson contacts his commanding officer while evading enemy military forces on Serbian ground. He is being pursued by a Serbian sniper whose mission is to dispose of him. The action sequences are awesome. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves war and action films.
B00003CXDG|4.0|I loved the chemistry between Ethan and Nyah. The action was still there but now they gave him a love interest who was not a colleague but was just as clever and unique as he is. Using the biological weapon as the national threat was credible and on target with today's problems. Add the spectacular opening shot with Ethan rock climbing and add a setting as gorgeous as Sydney, Australia and what can I say \\"Wow\\"!!! If you love motorcycles this will also pique your interest in the film.  Women get the romance, men the blood and guts, or vice versa,and everyone comes away from the movie content and feeling that everything turned out the way it should.
0060922583|5.0|A friend recommended this book and I bought &amp; read it blindly not knowing what it was about or what to expect.<br />It started out very scientific; with facts &amp; experiments.  For example it talks about how holograms are stored and projected, then it goes on to discuss how holographic type of storage may be used by our brains.  This was just an amazing read.<br />Then a little past half way, the book started to take on a more spiritual aspect ... this kind of caught me off guard, but I kept reading anyway.  As it turns out, it presented to me alot of alternate thoughts about the world.  I didn't agree with everything it put forth, but it really presented something to think about.<br />This is definitely one of the most important books I've ever read.  Even now, years later, I think about the concepts in this book regularly.
B00003CX8J|5.0|I watched the cartoon on tv as a kid. To see it on the big screen was awesome. The wary, suspicious, and yes yummy Wolverine makes the movie. Add in the story of Rogue, Jean Grey, Storm , and the ever evil Magnito and you have a hit! The movie really centers around Wolverine and Rogue which answers a lot of questions you might have had about the comic strip or the cartoon. What? What questions? Well, for one, why does Rogue have white streaks in her hair? Want to find out?  Watch the movie! You will not regret it.  Also recommended: Dungeons and Dragons.
0451199871|4.0|This is a good mystery.  Miss Marple is right in the midst of all the action.  My only complaint is that as Miss Marple is explaining how the murderer committed the crime she states they did something which must have been impossible.  I can't go into more detail without ruining the mystery.  It's still a good book.  Very suspenseful.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I loved this film. Two people who were once in love but youth and the insulting ways of society kept the two from each other. Now, older they are reunited. The heroine is still in love but the hero will not give her the time of day, focusing instead on the sisters of her brother-in-law. But as the movie progresses they continually meet up with each other. When it is announced that she is to marry another she is outraged at the rumors and soon the characters rediscover what love and confusion are all about. My favorite scene is when they are in the drawing room and he presents her with a letter.  Oh! If you are a Jane Austen fan this is the movie for you. Also recommended is Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, and Mansfield Park.
B00005R2M3|1.0|Be warned. If you want to play this CD on a PC or a Macintosh. It won't work. This CD has been copy protected. It might also not play in some DVD Players and car CD players.
B00002JV0I|5.0|The first music I heard from Immortal was the latest release &quot;Sons Of Northern Darkness&quot;, and I was instantly hooked!  I promptly picked up &quot;At The Heart Of Winter&quot;, and, after hearing others in their catalog, regard this as their second greatest release. The music is varied and interesting to listen to (unlike Battles In The North...sorry guys!) with awesome riffs all over the place!  It's been a while since I've been this excited about a band and am in awe of the power they incorporate into their playing.  Although there are only 6 tracks, there is not a single bad song on here.  You don't have to be a fan of so-called &quot;Black Metal&quot; (I'm not!) to love this album.  I'm sure it will be one of my favorite CD's that I bought this year (and I buy a lot of music).  Great artwork too!  A must-have for the collection of any fan of real metal!
B00004X0ER|5.0|I was going to start this review with a comparision with the Strokes-which seems to be the style these days. However, the Hives are cut from a much different musical cloth than the Strokes. Whereas the Strokes are heavily influenced by the 70's hipster NYC underground (Lou Reed, Television, with a touch of early Talking Heads), the Hives are well-versed in late 60's/70's Detroit punk (MC5, Stooges, with a hint of Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels). <br />That issue aside, the Hives have finally given us punkers an album to enjoy and lose our minds to. Warning to the Green Days, Blink 182's, and Sum 41's of the world: The Hives are gonna put your kind on the endangered species list! I absolutely enjoy every track on this album (even \\"Find Another Girl\\"-which sounds of Drifters/Association pop-and which will throw many listeners for a loop). My favorite tracks, though, are \\"Die, All Right!\\", \\"Statecontrol\\", \\"A Get Together to Tear It Apart\\", and \\"Supply and Demand\\". Any fan of punk or 60's garage rock will not be disappointed by this masterpiece. PUNK UBER ALLES!
B000062TU1|5.0|I have read all four of the Harry Potter books and I am starting to read them all over again. I loved this movie! It's nice to finally see a movie that is made from a book, that actually sticks to the story line. It brings to life the true imagination of J.K. Rowling. The visual effects are out of this world. This movie is not about witchcraft and ruining children's minds. This movie is about taking viewers of all ages to another place where they can have fun. We all get distracted in the real world and need to escape for something different, which is why we have movies. This creative and imaginative movie isn't just for children either. If you would like to watch an enjoyable movie without the sex, drugs, and a lot of violence for once, watch Harry Potter. You will be amazed.
B000065V9N|4.0|This is the first title that I picked up in Peter Gabriel's newly remastered back catalog.  I sold off my original CDs last year when I first got word of the remastering project, and now as of May 7th, 2002 they are finally here.  The numbered limited edition packaging has an 11-page booklet, as the 12th page is glued to the inside of the digipak.  There are some photo collages from video shoots, concerts, and studio sessions in addition to the reformatted lyrics and credits.  However, I was a little surprised that there are no historical notes included.  It's a decent but not lavish presentation.<br />As for the music, the tracklist is the same with the exception of &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; being moved to the end.  There are no bonus tracks.  The sound is top-notch as I expected, though it was not too bad to begin with in the case of this album.  This is a must-have disc, but if you already own the original CD issues in the PG catalog, consider one of his earlier albums first.  The sound quality improvements are reportedly more dramatic with those.  When I have the money I'll pick them all up and find out for myself. :-)
B000002MZ6|5.0|When you get this CD... light a candle, turn the lights off and let Mr. Oldfield take you on a most amazing and pleasure filled journey... this epic piece begins with sounds evoking images of creation itself... lonely and erie sounds being heard at first, then the voice of Neil Armstrong from his Apollo space mission enters in, reciting the dramatic opening verses of genesis... which leads to a gentle rhythm next beginning.... subsonic notes ocurring at evenly placed intervals as the main theme is stated which is repeated as a familiar point of reference throughout the rest of the work... feminine voices are then heard coming from 3 distinct locations in space which softly repeat the words &quot;burning&quot;.... &quot;melting&quot;.... &quot;dissolving&quot;.... cleverly and gently evoking images of the newly created planet...   This is a thoroughly enjoyable work, with each section leading into the next without any breaks at all, letting one know a musical journey has been embarked on, until at last the masterpieces final section concludes.  I believe this to be a very unique piece, with the only connection between this work and the well known and overplayed Tubular Bells being the distinctive tone of Mr. Oldfields guitar itself, which works quite wonderfully as placed within in the context of this work where it brings comfort and familiarity with it's ocassional echoing of the main theme throughout. This is a work which should be listened to undisturbed from beginning to end, as it will take you on a very  enjoyable journey for an hour or so if you can find the time to totally immerse yourself in the experience of listening to these songs, and remembering, distant Earth...
B00000J6AG|5.0|Well, what can I say about this CD that hasn't already been said? It is unbelievably good from start to finish. Moby is a genius, and I am eagerly awaiting the new CD, especially since it is rumoured to be similar to &quot;Play&quot;. Do yourself a favor and buy this CD if you don't already have it!
0393312836|4.0|I believe Burgess is a literary genius. This book is a constant page-turner.  Burgess thrilled me with his potrayal of the young, thuggish protagonist Alex in the 1960s in England.  Alex is a teen who gets his kicks out of extreme violence and destruction. Living his life with blood and women, his many murders eventually catch up with him.  After Alex is abandoned by his friends and put in jail, he asks to be the first to try the new experiment.  This new experiment Burgess has created is horrifying and at some points unreal.  It is a great book for those interested in human pyschology and the struggle between good and evil.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Perhaps one of the best movies so far this year. I'm still under deep impression from it. Definetily worth a spot in your DVD home collection.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|...Crowe being a nerdy science professor, that is.<br />This film is good. Acting is mostly solid, and the story (albeit far from the real Nash's adventures) is very nicely filtered for the silver screen.<br />However, I've yet to see an anti-social, Nobel-prize winning scientist with arms the size of Chevy tires. I also didn't think Crowe's \\"nerdiness\\" was very convincing. His moments of scientific reflection, whether social or self, seemed... well...  ingenuine. Though for the most part Crowe did an excellent job, I don't think he was the ideal candidate for this film (Dustin Hoffman, among others, would've fit the role much better, IMO).<br />I liked ABM while it was in theatres, and would readily see or buy it on DVD. It's an excellent film that has solid acting throughout. However, if there's one thing that I'd like to change about it is its choice of leading actor - not for his acting abilities so much as his representative character.
B00000I07Q|2.0|This band is as shallow as the shallowest thing ever devised. Bn Jovi (and Sambora and others that contributes songs here) know how to write cheesy, romantic anthems that pleases only teenage girls. The band has no substance, no sincerity. NEW JERSEY is one of their worst albums.
B000063DIR|1.0|You don't even have to be an Ozzy fan to be offended by this rerelease.<br />I hate when artists overproduce remasters or simply overdub and doctor old live tracks, but this is a new low.  Seems that due to a royalty dispute over the years between Ozzy's bassist and drummer on this album, instead of settling whatever the problem was, the Osbourne camp take a radical stance.  Ozzy takes the original masters, takes his vocals and Randy Rhodes' guitar and lays them over NEW bass and drum parts by members of his current band(!!!)  He cut out his old bandmates so that now they can never claim royalties on the album because they technically aren't on it anymore.  This was done for both this gem and for Ozzy's first solo (Blizzard of Oz).  Unbelievably shameless and disgusting.  Imagine your favorite band reissuing their albums tomorrow...with half the band gone.<br />I bought this without even knowing, and I have NEVER felt so gyped in my life as when I logged onto here afterwards and read the truth.  It was the first Ozzy album purchase, and a total waste.<br />But...can you tell the difference?  Actually, yes.  The original sounds better, period.  I'm not a huge Ozzy fan at all--I've heard him over the years and simply purchased an album.  But the word is that his regular fans universally pan the rerelease, claiming it simply...[stinks].  The mix is off, the timing is off, and this I've noticed--certain songs fade out sooner and are shorter.  And Ozzy even doctored his voice and Rhodes' guitar sound.<br />After watching Ozzy in everyday life on The Osbournes, I have to wonder how much say Ozzy even had in this.  The man goes on and on about how he misses Randy Rhodes, eulogizes the guy in the liner notes, and then goes and pulls this on Rhodes' 2 albums?!?  What kind of royalty dispute could he have had with the old players?  How much money, Ozz?  Couldn't have amounted to much with the bucks he's got.<br />So yes, I noticed a sound difference.  I'm not a regular Ozz fan, but I love this album now.  It rocks, plain and simple.  Over the Mountain, Flyin' High Again (which Poison totally ripped off with Nothin' But a Good Time), and then the ballad-turned-crunching rocker with You Can't Kill Rock 'N' Roll, then more gems, including S.A.T.O.  All good stuff.  You'll like Rhode's guitar.<br />Of course, I'm totally, 100% NOT recommending this RELEASE of the album.  Get the nice remasters from 1995 while they're still out there!fan, but I love this album now.  It rocks, plain and simple.

B00005LOUQ|2.0|Carrey overacts like always here. Director Ron Howard missed the mark, as he did before in HOWARD THE DUCK. HE started with a good concept on hands, but execution flawed.<br />The movie lacks some kind of &quot;rhythm&quot;. I almost slept.
0385335482|5.0|A great book for any one who loves to shop, who has made some horrible decisions with money, jobs, men,  etc. Very amusing.  I laughed out loud at least 20 times...I also enjoyed Shopaholic takes Manhattan, the sequel.
B000065U1N|5.0|Quite simply a masterpiece from Ridley Scott.  A difficult subject: the true story of a peace keeping mission in Somalia.  Scott is able to cut through the oppressing political atmosphere that surrounded, and created, the involvement of US forces in Somalia, to paint a vivid, unflinching and accurate story of several young men whose job it was to work in the most hostile of environments.  <br />The movie takes the viewer through an almost point-by-point perspective of the incident leading up to and during the battle in the Bakara Market-area of Mogadishu.  It does a fantastic job of not pointing blame, but telling the story of young men suddenly dealing with 60-1 odds to survive and the sizeable character of brotherhood that it takes and is often overlooked by most of the people who condemn the Rangers and Special Forces' involvement in Somalia -- remember, these men, including General Garrison, were following policy and orders as set by the Clinton administration and did not have much of a choice in this matter.  With that in mind, the movie breaks down the incident into its most basic form: survival under extreme odds.  <br />Black Hawk Down is not merely a war movie, only palatable for for the action buffs.  It is an honest look into human character under severe conditions, courage and the expensive price of peace.  The heroic scene of Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon protecting downed pilot Mike Durrant is worth seeing or buying this movie alone.  Shughart and Gordon were honored with the Medal of Honor for their actions. <br />I came away from this movie with a feeling of quiet resolve for the young men portrayed in the movie and admiration for our armed forces. It really made me think about character in a different way and how important honor is.
B00005V9HH|4.0|Great suspense, great mystery; is the glass half empty or half full, perhaps there may be no glass at all. Quite shocking its effect, that it offers originality to its genre.
B000065U1N|5.0|This was one of the most incredible movies I have \\"experienced\\" in a long time.  I say experienced because to watch it is to experience it.  It is so exquisitely filmed that you can honestly feel the tension, the fear, the hopelessness and frustration of these men.  Your eyes constantly dart from one part of the screen to another as the action typically explodes around you.  The acting is top-notch and the script first rate.  This picture deserved alot more recognition at the Oscars than it got.  In my humble opinion.
B000002H6C|3.0|Well, this is the end.<br />This album isn't too bad; it still has some of Metallica's old sound, but Jason's influence is noticeable, and so begins the death of Metallica (which may have been inevitable following the death of Cliff).  <br />The music is well written, and the lyrics have a message (something that Metallica eventually abandons), but it doesn't quite have the feel that it used to.  When I hear something from this album (probably One) on the radio, instead of turning it up (as I would anything from a previous album), I instead leave it low and reflect on what Metallica could have been, if they chose to stay true to their original cause.<br />The metal machine is dying and giving way to the money machine.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Brittany Spears is a bad role model for children all around the world. She sings through her nose and her songs are nauseating. Her clothes are inappropriate and are degrading to women around the world. She is a sex object. Oops!...I Did It Again is a song about her toying with a man. Children look up to pop stars and try to be like them. You see 4 year olds trying to \\"look like Brittany.\\" She should respect herself enough to dress nicely and be a good role model for children. Boys need to realize all women don't look like Brittany and she doesn't help stress this fact. I think Brittany should either start acting as a better role model because although children shouldn't, they look up to Britanny because they don't know any better.
B000002H97|1.0|This one makes it official.<br />Metallica has abandoned their fans and their music for the glory of life in the top 40.  I didn't even bother to buy this album after hearing what some of the songs were like.  Justice was the last one I bought for quite a while.  I naively bought Load, hearing that Metallica had \\"gone back to their roots\\", not true.  It's even worse than this album (hard as that may seem to accomplish).  As far as I'm concerned, Metallica produced FOUR albums (not including the garage days):<br />Kill 'Em All<BR>Ride The Lightning<BR>Master of Puppets<BR>And Justice for All...<br />They started to lose it on Justice, but barely hung on.  After that, it was all developed to compete in the Billboard charts.  Now, with their new noise, I'm not sure if I'd classify them as rock, country, or just plain .... <br />Those first three albums are the only ones worth spending money one.  Justice might be worth a few bucks for a used disc or tape, but not to buy new.  This album, you could probably record right from the radio, but one song will pretty much tell you what the rest sound like.  Two decent songs on an album isn't worth the money.  The rest you migth as well just download, since it won't be the MP3's quality that makes it sound bad.
0140042520|4.0|This is the 2nd Kerouac book i've read (the first was &quot;Maggie Cassidy&quot;) - and i found it enlightening and entertaining.<br />It tells the story of a few young men and their lifestyle - that of a Dharma bum.  The have very few possessions which they kepe is small shacks or in backpacks, and spend their time discovering nature and the dharma in this world.<br />Kerouac's writing style varies - in certain parts it seems like pure fiction (describes parties, characters' interactions with family, etc.), at some points it seems very philisophical (i learned a bunch about Buddhism), and at some points it is just very descriptive (i live in NYC, and it made me miss nature.)<br />There were a few parts that were &quot;wordy,&quot; but overall this book reads quickly and is very enjoyable.
B000001FTD|5.0|Among the Living is the second-best of the classic thrash albums coming from the year 1986. It's strength comes largely from it's distinctiveness, particularly in being the less serious, somewhat more punkish band.<br />  Individually, all the performances on this album are at least pretty good, most of them great. Joey Belladonna is an interesting lead singer. I didn't care for him much at first, mainly cause he was so more about actually singing then shouting, which doesn't seem like it would work with thrash, but it turns out that it does. Also the lyrics aren't brilliant, but many of them are at least stupidly amusing, particularly on I Am the Law The rhythm section is especially good, probably the best all-around one for any band. Charlie Benante is my favorite drummer, who's better then Dave from Slayer or all 3 of the Slipknot drummers combined. Frank Bello's bass comes through loud and clear, which alone makes him better then the mostly half-muted basses of the era. He's also extremely fast and frantic and a provides much stronger support for the leads than most basses. Ian's rhythm guitar is very distinctive, very winding and wild with lots of changes in the riff. Spitz's lead is the weakest part of them, primarily because there is not too much emphasis on them, and with most bands, Anthrax included, some of the solos are great, but the most of them don't contribute to the song all that much.<br />  All this aside, what really matter is how this all comes together, which is extremely well. The songs are all at least pretty good, most of them are excellent. Among the Living and Caught In A Mosh are the first 2 songs, and the best ones, with the drumming being especially good on both of them, and Mosh has one of the best bass lines ever. I Am The Law is another good track, with some fun vocals. Efilnikufesin is probably the best song on here other than the first two. Imitation of Life, the last track, is also of particular note, which is the shortest track, and also the most shifting and frantic.<br />  Lastly, though great, I don't think this is the best Anthrax album. Persistance of Time is vastly superior, so if you don't have any Anthrax cd's that would be a better place to start.<br />  9/10d also the most shifting and frantic.<BR>    Lastly, though great, I don't think this is the best Anthrax album. Persistance of Time is vastly superior, so if you don't have any Anthrax cd's that would be a better place to start.<br />     9/10
B00003CX9S|4.0|This film was beautiful - the crisp B&W, gentle acting, and beautiful costumes.<br />This movie is about a deformed man, rescued from a circus freak show by a doctor who tries to show him an ordinary life.  The story is sad and touching (but does move slowly at times).<br />The DVD offers special features - interviews with the producers about how the film came to be, a workshop by the make-up creator, and a photo gallery which includes photos of the REAL skull of J. Merrick, the \\"Elephant Man\\".
0446310786|5.0|Set in Maycomb Alabama, Harper Lee has created a wonderful story for all ages.<br /><br />Lawyer Atticus Finch along with his daughter Scout, son Jem and their friend Dill Harris,are at the nucleus of this tale. The children are adorable and innocent but as they spend their<br />summers together in this Southern state of Alabama, they are brought into direct contact with class distinction and racial discrimination at a very early age.<br /><br />Their father Atticus, a very fair and practical man is appointed to defend a black man Tom Robinson, who is<br />said to have allegedly raped a Caucasian woman Mayella Ewell.<br /><br />That crime is more seriously taken or just as seriously taken as a murder.It should be noted that this particular family although considered 'white trash' by the Macombe society are seen as extremely prejudiced and extremely poor, headed by a father who can be very violent at times.<br /><br />The innocence of these children are broken as the are caught up in the events which lead to the trial of this man. They witness the case which brings to light the hated and racial society they live in of which they want no part.<br /><br />This is a book that I wish I had read a long time ago. I recommend it highly!!<br />Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar (SUGAR-CANE 13/05/02)
B00005JKJA|3.0|This movie was the BEST of 2001.  I saw it 3 times in the theatre and couldn't WAIT for the DVD to come out.  The movie is beautiful visually and completely thought-stimulating.<br />HOWEVER... the DVD offers no special features and plays similarly to a VHS tape (no menu options, no chapter selection.) Of course, it's a must-have for any Lynch fan...<br />But remember Blue Velvet! (the original &quot;special&quot; edition had no special features, and next month a NEW special edition is coming out... loaded with features.)<br />Come on!  Where's the director's commentary?!<br />For such an incredible movie, we expect more from the DVD...
B00005QIPH|3.0|What a disappointment this album turned out to be.  Everyone and every article seemed to hype this album and group as the next best thing to come out of NYC's music scene.  As soon as I heard the first few tracks, I thought that Paul Westerberg and the Replacements should be suing the pants off these guys.  Anyone that says the Strokes have an original, fresh approach or some buzz phrase like that surely haven't been listening to music long enough.
B00005JKMQ|3.0|Michael Mann take on the enviable task of covering the life of one of most colorful characters of this century.   There simply have been simply too many noteworthy events in Ali's life to get through all of it in 2 hours.  I for one am glad that Mann and company attempted the impossible.  This story was too important to have never been told.  The DVD is an entirly different story however.  There is no excuse to leave all of the extras off of the DVD version!  I'm that this is simply a ploy by Sony to generate double sales for this movie.  One for the release version and then a &quot;directors cut&quot; extended version!
B00005JKCF|2.0|This movie was boring. I really do not get why there's so much hype about it. The dialogue was terrible and the romantic story was ridiculous. Also, the plot was painstakingly predictable. Ok, all movies are clichd one way or another, but that does not bother the audience if the characters look real and multidimensional and the story is well developed and paced. In this flick, instead, we have nothing but clichs and clichs, over and over and over again, and nothing else to make the story stand out. The second half of the movie was especially bad, with spider-man doing all the staff that superman would do: saving children from buildings on fire, saving the innocent girl from being raped, stopping bad boys from robbing money from-I-do-not-remember-who, I mean, you get the picture. But the worst is served in the final scene with Peter Parker and the chick whatever-her-name-was. I mean, talk about completely unbelievable and ludicrous dialogue. My friends and I were laughing our heads off, I mean it was really as bad as the dialogue in \\"Autumn in New York.\\"  Only the action scenes were ok, but nothing I hadn't seen before. And you can't base a movie on special effects. They are fun for five or ten minutes, but, after a while, they bore you to death.

Down and dirty, dealing with the dark side of crime and the justice system, Connelly has hit pay dirt with this one. This one has real surprises dealing with Harry's professional and personal life, and the reader will not be disappointed.

0312952813|3.0|In the second novel of the series, Bosch runs into Black Ice, a new drug on the street, that leads to shady cops, double crosses, a trip to Mexico and a rather predictable ending. I like the character that Connelly has created and that's why I keep coming back, but the plots are filled with way out ideas that don't seem to fit the down to earth Bosch.  I find Bosch such an interesting character I keep reading these mysteries in the hopes that the mystery will fit the quality of the hero.
0553213105|4.0|Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, although I found it to be quite difficult to get into at first, proved to be a truely enjoyable reading experience.  Despite its difficult language and rather lengthy descriptions and dialog, which tended to confuse me and cause me to lose interest at several points throughout the novel, the plot and events of this book left me in uplifted spirits and with the positive feeling that love truely can overcome any obstacle put in its way.  The romance between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, as well as the relationship between Jane and Mr. Bingley, left me guessing throughout the entire novel, and motivated me to trudge through the somewhat uneventful chapters inbetween exciting events.  I recommend this book to any person with a high attention span interested in reading an uplifting story about the powers of true love.
0385503954|1.0|I approached this book with great enthusiasm and finished it, not without difficulty, with great disappointment. It was boring to say the least. The first 170 pages covered a play, that was not to be, and a migraine headache. Then the grand crime was, at best, the actions of a spoilt brat. The description of the Tallis family was so cliche. The sick wife and mother who accepted her unfaithful husband in return for living the upperclass life. The oldest, too perfect son, who was adored by all, including his siblings. The two daughters, the oldest who struggles with being an academic in the 1930's and the youngest a brat.<BR>After the first tedious part of the book that concludes with \\"The Crime \\". We then have to suffer another 60 pages which are basically a walk of 40 miles through France as  Robbie esacapes during the occupation of France by the Germans.<BR>The third part of the book mostly covers nurse training in a London hospital. The now 18 year brat is having second thoughts and wants to make ammends.She punishes herself by training as a nurse, a noble profession, far to lowly for a brat like her.<BR>The book concludes with a soppy chapter about the brat who is now 77 years old. Eventhough she has been told she has vascular dimentia she soldiers on to go to a family birthday party in her honor at, no less , her family home which is now an hotel. Lucky for her it did not become an amusement or safari park like so many other run down manor houses in the U.K.<BR>Boring, boring, boring!!!!

0060194995|2.0|To Kill A Mocking Bird by Harper Lee is not a bad book. I enjoyed the situations that took place and the events that happend in the book. I disagree though with the character choice, not necessarily  the choices but who the narrator should have been. I dont believe that Scout would be able to remeber things like the problems that took place let alone being able to basically turn away a mob? At her age things like that are hard to beleive espceially her and jem and Dill sneaking around at night? Its hard to beleive children not even ten years of age could accomplish sneaking out like that and not getting caught is very hard to beleive im 16 and cant even sneak out like those characters. I'd like to see this book from an older adults view like Atticus or a black persons view like Calpurnia. Overall the book is quite enjoyable and I do recommend it to other peolpe my age and older, this is one book i may read more then once
B00004SYWZ|4.0|This album is very different from their previous work. The music is more into pop than rock. The album features songs with mainly guitars than any other instrument. I think they are mad for bringing out 'Velvet' and 'Summer Moved on' as singles! This is because they are good sons but doesn't deserve to be singles. The song ' Won't Forget Her' deserves to be a single but isn't. They did a great job on 'Minor Earth Major Sky' as it is a brilliant song with heavy base designed to surprise people when it comes up. For me I have to give it 4 stars because it is boring on some tracks but not all.

0966638328|5.0|I received this book at the Pantone &quot;Communicating with Color Seminar&quot; held in NYC last year. Leatrice Eiseman was as great a speaker as she is a writer and her cutting edge color information couldn't be more on target, in fact, she is THE person to watch for color and trend forecasting. This book, as well as her lecture, stresses the roles that our senses and emotions play in the way we view and experience color and how designers can best use that information in the marketplace. A sizable portion of the book is devoted to exploring all the major color groups, and there is also a chapter on selecting colors by color combinations as they create different moods and feels. She wraps up the book with very useful conversions for printing four-color equivalents of most of the pantone colors. Any designer who follows his or her job through printing will greatly appreciate that section.<br />Pantone Guide to Communicating with Color is always within reach in my studio and would provide an invaluable guide for any designer.
0385335482|3.0|This was a book I was not planning to read, but heard so many raves for it that curiosity got the best of me. <br />This is a fun, funny book about the trials and tribulations of a full fledged compulsive obsessive shopper! Becky Bloomwood, ironically a financial journalist for a money management magazine, cannot control her urge to shop! She NEEDS everything and her mind doesn't rest until she gets it.<br />Becky is a bit flighty, but she is also humorous, and has such an addictive way of looking at things and at rationalizing her spending. Her relationship with her friends, family, and would be male relationships are less than satisfying. She continues to take, take, take from her roommate without ever offering anything in return. And she wracks up insurmountable debt from cover to nearly cover, until she begins to turn the situation around. She finally gets passionate about something other than shopping, and that is what makes all the difference. She also wins the heart of her &quot;crush&quot; and that is where we are left.<br />This book is not deep, or even thick with a plot. It is just a lot of fun when you are in need of mindless, effortless entertainment. I am definitely going to read the sequel, but read these books in tandem with another book. That way, depending on my mood I have Becky Bloomwood's rollercoaster shopping/spending sprees to look forward to when I need a good laugh anf guaranteed fun.
B00004RFFM|5.0|I watched this movie last night, and was looking at the reviews today. I was sorely dissipointed that people were giving this movie bad reviews. Instead of being 3.5 stars, it should be up there with 4 or 4.5.<BR>     The bad aspects of the movie are pretty obvious when you watch it. The movie itself is not really scary. You don't get the feeling that you yourself are being hunted, like you would in an alien movie. Also, I can't believe that no one told the CGI people that Mako sharks are supposed to have really long tails (at least 15 feet) that look more like swords. The sharks are also moving really, really fast, or very slow. And the sheer predictability of a hurricane coming in, or something else going wrong. And why didn't the researchers have their station somewhere near society, so they dont have to deal with problems like that?<BR>     Besides that, I think it's a pretty good movie. At the start of the movie, you pretty much know that all of the non-major scientists are going to die. But I thought Samuel L. Jackson would survive for a little longer. The unpredictability of that scene, and a couple others was great. This movie isn't really like Jaws, for all those whiners and their stupid reviews. Jaws was entirely different. The acting for this movie was great, but I probably would have liked the characters more if more scenes about them were put in. The one person I didnt like was that Carter guy. I wish he died. <BR>     To close, this is still an entertaining movie, with nasty shocks along the way.
B000001ELR|3.0|KISS released their CREATURES OF THE NIGHT album in October, 1982. It is said to be their heaviest to date. They wanted to blow everyone's ears out and send a message that they were back to their hard rock roots. As a result of the disasterous \\"(Music From)The Elder,\\" Kiss needed to get back on track, and did they ever! The title track blew me away when I first listened to it! \\"Saint and Sinner\\" is good but rather slow. The same holds true for \\"Rock and Roll Hell,\\" which is about Ace Frehley. Speaking of Ace, I believe he did a few basic tracks for \\"I Love It Loud,\\" but the rest of the album was done with Vinnie Vincent on lead guitar. The songs of this album are heavy, but a rather slow and kind a drag. The album also was flop, peaking at #45, and taking ten years to go gold! I'm not sure if the reason was for the slow songs, or because of the makeup, which was getting old. Kiss would remove the warpaint for their next album, LICK IT UP,\\" so this album is the end of an era. Overall, it is a good heavy album that send you through a riveting journey.
B00003CXTG|1.0|How can I describe this movie, simple, it is one of the worst I have EVER SEEN!!!! Really bad acting, very BORING story, throw in Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay heavy handed overwrought special effects and direction and what you get one hell of a flashy movie with incredbly DUMB story lines and even worse acting. Except for the fact the Japanese did attack Pearl Harbor there is very little in this movie that is realistic. Even the Dootitle raid seems phoney. A very fat Alec Baldwin was terrible as Jimmy Dootitle, the special effects are so ridiculous that they are laughable and make the story seem like some sort of fantasy sci-fi, and that Love triangle PLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEAAAASSSSSEEE!!!!!!!! This movie is simply terrible. I could wait to unload my DVD on [line], I was sorry I ever paid the money for it to begin with!!!!

In Gone for Good, the hero's brother disappears....is he dead?  Yes?  No?  Maybe?  Then the dutiful girlfriend disappears...is SHE dead?  Yes?  No?  Maybe?  Are the good guys good or bad?  Is the FBI good or evil?  Yes?  No?  Maybe?  Do you see a trend here?  Who will the hero of the third book in the series lose?  His beloved dog, Scooter?  Will Scooter be dead?  Yes, no or maybe?  And will the FBI be good or bad, and will the bad guys be truly bad or really kind of nice? Seriously, there was such little difference between this book and Coben's most recent one, Tell No One, that I was amazed that he got away with publishing both.  Gone for Good is almost like an outtake reel of the previous book.  The two plots are entirely too similar, the characters virtually identical, and the \\"bad guys\\" almost laughable.  When The Ghost, a deadly assasin,  sidled up to the hero  at the airport with crumpled autopsy results explaining maternity based on gross anatomy, I had to laugh. I guess he had to get that point in somehow. Oh Myron, where have you gone?
B000065U1N|3.0|The latest US propaganda film, Black Hawk down, is the biggest screening of an illusion since the infamous Osama Video. These deceptions are designed to keep the American Public blind to the real motives behind US Foreign Policy. The US Public bought the notion that the War in Afghanistan is a war against terrorism. They bought the notion that the Gulf War was to restore the legitimate government of Kuwait. They are now being resold the notion that operation restore hope, in Somalia, was merely a humanitarian mission. The film was produced with the assistance of the pentagon. Understandably it overtly aids the furthering of American foreign policy objectives. Black Hawk down is not about artistic expression, historical analysis or even about entertainment and it is definitely not about the truth. In January 1993 a report appeared in the Los Angeles Times, under the heading \\"The oil factor in Somalia; four American petroleum giants had agreements with the African nation before its civil war began. they could reap big rewards if peace is restored\\". This suggested that the US was not interested in Humanitarian efforts (for which she was acting far too late in any event). Rather she was interested in the vast reserve of oil which Conoco, Amoco, Chevron and Phillips (American oil giants) had discovered there at the time of the rule of pro-U.S. President Mohamed Siad Barre. This was before he was overthrown in Jan 1991 and the country thrown into civil war. In fact Conoco went as far as providing the housing for the US embassy and the headquarters for the US marines. <br />Mark Bowden revised his book \\"Black Hawk Down\\" to make it suitable for US government propaganda, even the movie director Alex Cox Pointed out that \\"It's interesting to observe how the story was re-told over that time.\\" In previous articles he clearly points out that US troops killed unarmed men, women and children from the outset of their mission: 'In one incident, Rangers took a family hostage. When one of the women started screaming at the Americans, she was shot dead. In another incident, a Somali prisoner was allegedly shot dead when he refused to stop praying outside. Another was clubbed into silence. The killer is not identified.'\\" The only incident he mentioned was the fact that GI John \\"Stebby\\" Stebbins, renamed as Company Clerk John Grimes in the film, is now serving a 30-year sentence in Fort Leavenworth military prison for raping and sodomising a 12-year-old girl. <br /> Americas intervention in Somalia was to secure its interest i.e the oil and secondly Somalia is situated in the Horn of Africa which is a strategic location. During the rule of President Mohammed Siad Barre, the US had access to Somali military bases. Siad Barre granted American warplanes landing rights at airports. He also allowed American warships use of port facilities at Berbera, a northern Somali port town on the Gulf of Aden, and at Mogadishu, the country's capital, which borders the Indian Ocean. Access to these facilities have played an important role since 1980 in American military plans to respond to crises in the Middle East, Southwest Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. The facilities also counter the Soviet air and naval facilities in Ethiopia, South Yemen, the Socotra Island off the South Yemen coast, and on the Dahlak Archipelago off the Red Sea coast of Ethiopia. The loss of American access to Berbera and Mogadishu would diminish greatlyU.S. access to the region, and tilt the regional power balance substantially in favour of the Soviet Union. <br />The film Black Hawk Down like all other main stream media propaganda will not present any of these facts. Instead it seeks to present the Somalian Muslims as backward and barbaric who are in need of American civilisation. It will present operation restore hope as a battle between good and evil as the media has done in its coverage of the war in Afghanistan. It will present Mohamed Farah Aideed as the source of all the evil in Somalia, another Usama bin Ladin or Saddam Hussein who the Americans need to remove from power to rescue the people. This demonisation of a people is necessary for the US government to justify its war to the American people. <br />Demonisation of others produces pride in their shallow American values of democracy and freedom. It is a call to American nationalism, in order to prepare the people for future colonialist operations.
B000002UAR|4.0|Generally acknowledged as the album where The Beatles fully stepped into their shoes as the World's Best Band, this is the album where The Beatles went serious - for good. And it shows. Their lyric writing had much matured by this time - although they still threw out occasional junk like Yellow Submarine and Doctor Robert. In particular, the lyrics of John Lennon had gotten only better, as he had come under the definite influence of Bob Dylan by this time. George Harrison - always a fine and underrated lyricist - as well turns in several good tunes (3 on this album.) And, as always, the band - and Paul, as usual, in particular - manage to fit, for the most part, spectacular melodies to their lyrical ideas, creating, here, songs that were at the same time (mostly) serious and also highly accessible. There is a reason many regard this as The Beatles' first true masterpiece. Although they did not neglect the Chuck Berry-esque outbursts - or silly love songs - that had always been prevalent in their work, they had begun to move beyond mere rock `n' roll at this time. They had become better musicians as well: Harrison turns in several searing leads, and McCartney shines on bass. Harrison kicks the album off well with the blazing and satiric Taxman - a fine song - and then Paul ups the ante with the epic orchestral-inflected Eleanor Rigby. The little ditty I'm Only Sleeping is Lennon's first contribution, before it's back to Harrison - this time armed with his sitar - on Love You To. Many classic songs abound on this disc - Here, There, And Everywhere; She Said, She Said; Good Day, Sunshine; ...And Your Bird Can Sing; I Want To Tell You; Got To Get You Into My Life; Tomorrow Never Knows... too many to mention. In them, The Beatles reached a level of musical and lyrical sophistication that had never before been attempted - much less reached - before in popular music. It stands as an essential rock album to this day.
B00005NNU4|5.0|It is troubling to read some of the other reviews for this amazing album.  Sanada has given us another masterpiece and I read of how some are critical because it sounds like 60's music and the like.  Sanada is a throwback to an age when musicians, songwriters, singers were about art not sales.  He could very well have given us &quot;Sign Your Name&quot; recycled for the 50th time by now.  However, he chooses the road less traveled which is to continue to grow as an artist and a human being and we are blessed enough to take the musical journey with him.  To be sure an album of this grandeur is sure to be lost upon the brain dead masses who buy the latest R. Kelly project.  For those enamored with the top 10 Wildcard is sure to be a pearl cast before them they cannot begin to decipher.  These 19 gems are exactly what a music lover is sure to feel.  On the other hand, if you are looking for someone who is imitating the latest Neptunes beat this album is not for you.  This album stays in heavy rotation for me.  I take it to work, in the car and bring it in the house.  I may need to order three copies.  I play it and can never skip a track.  Just when I think I am done with it I get to a song like &quot;Suga Free&quot;, &quot;Designated Fool&quot;, &quot;Shalom&quot;, or &quot;Love Can You Hear Me&quot; and am fascianted all over again.  I play it over and over and never can get bored.  I have been fortunate enough to hear some of the out takes from this album like &quot;Mona Lisa Laughing&quot;, &quot;Windows&quot; and &quot;Some Birds Blue&quot;  which are incredible in their own right.  This man could have released a double album if these are the songs he deems as &quot;sub-par&quot;.  His throw away tracks put to shame 98% of what passes for music today.  If you have not bought this one yet do yourself a favor and make that order.  You wont need another album until next year sometime.  Peace...........
B00005JKCF|1.0|I know a lot of people loved this movie. I don't know if these people are Spiderman or comic book freaks or not. But, I don't know... I didn't see what's so amazing about it. The action scenes weren't too bad - though the special effects were too rubber-like. I didn't like the Green Goblin's cheesy villain cliche lines. The movie was VERY predictable. I don't see how some people say it blew away the original Batman movie. At least Batman had some style and nice atmosphere(and I'm not a Batman fan or anything). Spiderman was just... generic
038533558X|3.0|I was unpleasantly surprised at this book because I waited so long after reading Tell No One, which I loved, for this to come out.<BR>My opinion is that the author has way too many characters in this book to keep track of.  It became a chore to read while trying to remember who was who.  It was fun however to read about Livingston, NJ as I am from West Orange!  I'll still try his next one.

B00005YUNY|5.0|On November 21st and 22nd 2001 Yes visited the Heineken Music Hall in Amsterdam and gave 2 concerts ... the 2nd one ... was filmed and is now available on video and DVD. ... the DVD version [has] a beautiful mix of band and orchestra ... The DTS sound gives it all an extra dimension .<br />The concert starts with an overture by the orchestra, that is not visible at that moment. The background is a Roger Dean-like landscape.<br />After the intro the band starts with the epic Close to the Edge and, immediately, you sense the asset the orchestra is for this song. It brought tears in my eyes from emotion to see young orchestra members with such dedication to music that was written before they were even born. Also on screen there appear icons for animation in the background and there are multiple camera-angles in this song possible.<br />Next is Long Distance Runaround from the Fragile album with a beautiful orchestra opening that is really an asset to the song.<br />From the new album Magnification they played Don't go first. I think it's not their most powerful track of the album and it surprised me the song did it live very well.<br />In the Presence Off, also from their latest album, are, together with Dreamtime, my favourites. In arrangement and length it's a 2001 Yes semi-epic.<br />Then, oh my God, finally, after all these years, Gates of Delirium is been introduced. Together with C.T.T.E this is the mother of all Yes epics. Tom Brislin really showed his craftsmanship in the \\"war\\" part of the song. This is a perfect song to play with an orchestra and you can hear that they do a perfect job in the changeover from the \\"war\\" part to the \\"peace\\" part of the song .Soon oh Soon let's the song end in a sea of tranquillity. Multi-camera angles and animations of war are also visible during this song.<br />After this epic we are attended by maestro Steve Howe and he entertains us with his guitar virtuoso by playing two songs of his solo albums.<br />Another golden oldie is Starship Trooper from the Yesalbum. During this song the orchestra has leave of absence and immediately you get an \\"unplugged\\" feeling when they are not there. The harmonies are perfect in this song and the only drawback is the shifting from the 1st layer to the second layer on the DVD and the lack of the Wakeman solo on his moog during the end of the song because Brislin played it a little thin in my opinion.<br />Anderson states that the day before they played the next song for the first time live and he introduces the title track of their last album; Magnification. One of the highlights of their album and played perfectly on stage.<br />It's back to 1972 with And You And I. Played live a zillion times but never lost it's charisma. In the multi-camera angle you can see animation with 2 robots.<br />If you haven't seen this, you ain't seen nothing yet ; Ritual, from the \\"Tales\\" album is one of the four tracks of this double album and one of two, for me, accessible tracks. The drum part in the middle with Anderson, Squire, Brislin and White makes it an attraction of the first order. What an energy pours out of that song!<br />From the time of it's first release on the Yesalbum \\"I,ve Seen All Good People\\"has always been a great rock song that survived decades of rock history. So get up and boogie: as Anderson says in the intro to the audience.<br /> ... with all the cameras rolling, Steve had to make concessions and \\"Owner\\" was played before the last song from this evening; Roundabout from the Fragile album. During this song the stage is filled with all the members of the orchestra waving and dancing on the music and expressing their joy of being part of performing in timeless music by a timeless band.<br />Yes, what a wonderful, magical evening it was.

B000002NHN|5.0|I've had this CD for many years, and I will say that it is definitely one of the best CDs I've ever listened to.  I think I might have worn it out listening to &quot;The Mummer's Dance&quot;, which is in my opinion the best track on the CD, &quot;Marco Polo&quot;, &quot;Dante's Prayer&quot;, and &quot;The Highwayman&quot;.  I've listened to Ms. Mckennit's other more famous tracks, such as &quot;The Lady of Shallot&quot;, &quot;To Drive the Cold Winter Away&quot;, and &quot;The Mystic's Dream&quot;, and her style has deviated in this CD from the traditional Celtic music, but not by much.  There's some Eastern influence (especially in &quot;Marco Polo&quot;), but I'm not complaining, as it sounds GREAT.  Please check it out.  She's not very well known, so any publicity helps her to make more amazing music.
6302238331|3.0|So having seen all the reviews and heard the hype I was a little dissapointed.    My biggest problem with the movie is this: I grew up watching all the police story/action movies that have been trying to take what the French Connection did and do it bigger and better.  And in almost any category you can name there are other movies that do a better job than the french connection.  This isn't to say that the French Connection doesn't do a good job in many categories, it does.  But while intellectually I can appreciate the genius of the movie for the time it came out (30+ years ago), I can't get really excited about it in my heart (having seen better chase scenes, plots, grittyness, unlikable/likeable characters, etc) <BR>    I am going to go out on a limb here, but I would guess many of the people who are responsable for all the 5 star reviews saw the movie on the big screen (or are far better than I at turning intellectual knowledge into heartfelt excitement) And for them I think it makes sense, it probably blew away a whole generation of people when it came out, and the nostalga of flick and the fact that after 30 years it is still a pretty good movie must make them love it.  I'm not of that generation of people though and it doesn't blow me away. :/  <BR>      So if you didn't catch this one back in the day, you probably won't be quite as excited about it as some of the reviewers you see shouting it's praises above all action movies of the last 30 years. Still it is pretty decent flick to rent if you haven't seen it.
B00003CXAY|5.0|Did you know that there has been a sequel to Koyaanisqatsi? Powaqqatsi, life in transformation. If I didn't see the film myself in the late 80's and didn't have the fantastic soundtrack by Phillip Glass sitting right infront of me, I wouldn't believe this film ever existed. Very rare on video (only seen it shops once), never released on laser disk, hasn't appeared in the Rep Cinemas, and definitely hasn't been released on DVD...yet. Baraka borrowed very much from Powaqqatsi but in my opinion is not as cohesive. Powaqqatsi is as much a flowing masterpiece of audio and visuals as Koyaanisqatsi. Phillip Glass repurposed much of the score for KUNDUN from Powaqqatsi. I'm not sure why Powaqqatsi has been so hidden and not widly released, especially with the popularity of Koyaanisqatsi and Baraka. <br />...I just did a search on Powaqqatsi and am very excited to report that Godfrey Reggio is currently working on a 3rd Qatsi film, NAQOYQATSI - War life. Due out in the fall of 2002, along with the re-release of Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi. Perhaps this is when they'll finally make their way to DVD!

B00005ASHM|5.0|In the Editor column he states that Sgt. Pepper misses the point of this album, no the editor misses the point.  The two albums must be listend together to understand one another; it is simply impossible anyother way.  Pet Sounds is written by one person, Brian Wilson, and thus he encorparates both escapism and everyday reality into eachsong; Sgt. Pepper splits the two devoting songs both to reality and escapism.  Sgt. Pepper clearly understood the point of this album.  Look life is sad and depressing at times; there is heart ache and lost love; but in the end there is happiness and life does go on.  This is a must listen for every single teenager; if I knew about this album in my teens I know it would have made my life a lot easier.  Oh and if you want to be really tripped out look at where the classical; insturment only songs are tracks 6 and 12.  Then look at tracks 6 and 13 on Sgt. Pepper.  <BR>One last thing about this album, the most peciular thing about it is its most famous,\\"commerical\\" song; Sloop John B.  It realy does not seem to fit in at all.  In reality, however, it turns otu to be one of the most influential songs on the entire album and in my opinon what influenced Paul the most on Sgt. Pepper.  Sloop John B. is the message of the entire album; life is a crazy, hectic thing dont get [mad] about unimportant things.  Life is too short just have fun and live it.
0743420373|2.0|The Millionaire Next Door exposes the myth of American millionaires as being flamboyant consumers with exciting lifestyles.  Using self-proclaimed extensive research and seemingly endless case studies, the authors reveal that the vast majority of millionaires are, in fact, frugal bargain hunters with boring exisitences.  This, in a nut shell, is the sum and substance of the entire book.  With 7 factors to explain how one can attain and maintain wealth, the authors beat the theory to death using both sexist and biased examples to support their thesis.  This is not to say that their observation isn't valid, but the authors could have easily written a equally informative pamphlet.  As a high school student I found it amusing that the authors completely downplay the importance of higher education in favor of strategic savings.  It is hardly a revelation that: \\"Financially independent people are happier than those in their same income/ age cohort who are not financially secure.\\" Few people would need a 258 page book to drive that point home.
B00005R87Q|5.0|Well to sum up my summary this movie ROCKED. This movie has it all. the action was awesome. the cars were sweet. and most of all the hot girls. the dvd is cool because it has even more, like deleted scenes and stuff. if there were more than 5 stars i'd give'em to it.
B00005OAA6|4.0|I was not a fan of Victoria Adams back then, but I gave her CD a try after watching the &quot;Not Such An Innocent Girl&quot; video, one of my all-time favorites... W, O, W... What a beautiful surprise! Not only has Victoria obviously gained confidence on the vocal part, she has also discovered herself as a very sensitive person throughout this album, much more simple, a little less posh, a little more heartfelt... <br />This album was inspiration to me, and I listen to it very often without skipping any tracks!<br />There are a few songs I like a little less, and that probably even her biggest fans won't like as much as her single hits, and these are her slower songs, tracks #3, #11 and #12. However, the album<BR>would not be complete without them, and it is a shock to hear Victoria express so much vulnerability, after what we have seen from her with the Spice Girls. <br />The songs that are really, really good are &quot;Midnight Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Like That&quot; and &quot;No Trix, No Games&quot;, catchy RnB tunes that could really hit the big time, along with orchestral ballad &quot;I.O.U.&quot;, that will bring tears to your eyes. <br />Afetr hearing that surprisingly well-done and complete album, I am anticipating Victoria's next single with a lot of excitement...

B00005JKCF|5.0|I've read the spiderman comics since i was 12 and have always loved the comic book. when i found out there was gonna be a movie i just couldn't wait. i was a bit worried about who they would cast as Peter Parker but Tobey Maguire IS Peter Parker. The script is so great and keeps moving. i couldn't see all the fuss about spidey's web-shooters since i thought that in this film they enhanced spidey's appeal. Also i loved the fact that they drew home spidey's problem with letting others in and the 'with great power comes great responsibility' fact. much like the cartoon that aired a few years ago. this truly deserves the name spider-man. although i didn't like the end since i am a bit of an old-romantic and was worried that the scene on Brooklyn Bridge was gonna end with MJ's fate the same as Gwen Stacy's since i'm a big MJ fan.<BR>the cast were just great. Kirsten Dunst was brilliant as MJ. the bloke they had play J. Jonah Jameson was brilliant as well, it wa like jameson had lept out of the comic and came alive, although i was happy with the way ol spidey shut him up. Willem Defoe was excellent as Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin and really lived up to the character. (i would've liked to have seen Venom in the movie but that would've made the film 4 hrs long and probably run into the trillions to make). i thought star wars episode 2 was gonna be my film of the year, but after seeing this i think star wars is gonna have to really put up a big fight to knock this movie off my top spot.

0345345061|5.0|A collection of material about and by J.R.R. Tolkien, this is a must-have for any fan of Lord of the Rings.  It combines several previous publications into one longer book, including &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot; and &quot;Father Giles of Ham.&quot;<br />It begins with an essay by noted fantasy writer Peter Beagle, who also wrote the screenplay for the animated LOTR movie eons and eons ago. &quot;The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son&quot; is radically different from Tolkien's more popular works, in that it is more of a play and less of a short story. It will probably appeal to fewer, given its obscure historical context. &quot;Farmer Giles&quot; is about a rather unusual farmer called on to deal with a rather unusual dragon; this is definitely a light, fluffy, funny story. &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot; and &quot;On Fairy Stories&quot; are more for the analytical thinkers among Tolkien's fans. &quot;Leaf&quot; is something of a glimpse into Tolkien's own soul, concerning his work and his own mortality. &quot;Fairy Stories,&quot; on the other hand, is one of the best-known essays on fantasy works and should be shoved in the face of anyone who denies fantasy's literary worth.<br />We then lapse into entirely different material. There is a long poem called &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil,&quot; written in the style and meter of his songs about himself in LOTR, when he meets the hobbits. It explains a little more about the hearty Maia and his wife Goldberry, as does the second of the poems, &quot;Bombadil Goes Boating.&quot; I didn't understand the beautifully written &quot;Errantry&quot; very well; but I did think that the catchy &quot;Princess Mee&quot; was cute, about a little elf princess dancing with her reflection. &quot;The Man in the Moon Came Down Too Soon&quot; is written in a very different style from the similarly titled &quot;Stayed Up,&quot; and definitely in a less merry style. There is also the entertaining &quot;Perry the Winkle&quot; and the utterly creepy &quot;Mewlips,&quot; and the amusingly jerky &quot;Cat.&quot; Also the eerie, beautiful &quot;Sea Bell,&quot; which seems almost like a dream.<br />LOTR fans will recognize some of these poems: &quot;The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late,&quot; which fans of LOTR will recognize as the song that Frodo sings in an inn. &quot;Stone Troll&quot;, which Sam sang to entertain the others. &quot;Oliphaunt,&quot; an old rhyme about certain enormous pachyderms.

The fact that Ruth Gordon is nearly 80 and the boy is still in his teens says that there can be love for everyone. I believe it could happen, because in our world today, anything can and has happened. Everyone hopes they fall in love completely, someday, and I have found someone younger than me. Not to this extreme, but he is 8 years younger. We have been together for almost 7 years now. He is my rock, my friend, my lover and my guardian angel here on earth.
0525946284|3.0|In \\"Jackdaws\\", Ken Follett returns to the form of \\"Eye of the Needle\\" and \\"The Key to Rebecca\\", spinning a tale that if a bit melodramic and not quite believable, is still entertaining and well worth the time. \\"Jackdaws\\" is reportedly based (very loosely, one would assume) on the true story of female allied spies operating in Nazi-occupied France during WWII. It \\"stars\\" Felicia 'Flick' Clairet, a British agent married to a French resistance fighter. As with many of Follett's novels, the sub plot of a love affair is woven into the story line, likely to insure additional appeal for broader audience, as well as the attraction for a possible screen play. Follett at his best is a master story teller, and he is in top form with \\"Jackdaws\\". He crafts a suspense that is palpable and engrossing, set with just enough history to establish some credibility. But while the plot and story development are superb, the same level of depth falls short in the character development. The characters appear to come straight from central casting: the brave but irreverent hero/spy, the sadistic Nazi officer, a female crew of ally agents reminiscent of \\"The Dirty Dozen\\". On balance, a good book for the beach or a long plane trip: mindless entertainment that will neither make you think nor disappoint.
0736041850|5.0|Excellent resource.    Over the last 15years my sports experience includeds weight training, running, bicycling, skiing, yoga, pilates, motorcycling, dirt biking, kayaking.    I've had the benefits of one-on-one training and coaching and I've read many books on these topics.   I've suffered my share of injuries and learned even more about my body through physical therapy and chiropractic.   It is surprising to me to have found a resource that at this point that can so quickly multiply my body knowledge.  It is probably the most worthwhile fitness book I've ever purchased.  The illustrations are the perfect compliment to dedicated personal training and professional coaching.  I'm 36, and a very active woman and I know this book will pay major returns for me in channeling my efforts, and preventing future injury.   Get it if you are serious about being fit and healthy.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Was this saber rattling claptrap really necessary? Pearl Harbor is a very expensive, inaccurate and stupid movie starring one of the worst actors around: Ben Affleck. <BR>And they spent even more money for a \\"re-edit\\" for audiences in Japan! How ridiculous, \\"We're gonna get those ... Japs!\\" changed to \\"This is terrible, we must do something about it!\\". If that is'nt bad enough, the love story will have you reaching for the \\"Stop\\" button on your DVD player.

0060194995|4.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is a great story. It invloves Atticus Finch and his two children Scout and Jem who mature through the story. The main part of the book is a trial where Atticus is defending a black man who is accused of raping a low-class white woman. The people of the town are against what Atticus is doing and through this and the rest the story, you learn about racism, predjudice, and maturatiopn. Harper Lee does a good job of describing the setting and the characters. And her style of writing involves telling the story through the children's perspective with humor, and good decriptions. Overall this a good book that involves many issues that you might face in life, and I recommend that you read this book.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Just about everyone who has seen this film agrees that it is rare in that it is a sequel which is better than the original. The directors cut is a longer than the original and has a lot more scenes. It is hard to see why they were cut originally as they do not change radically the character of the film. <br />Aliens is a film that is set over a very short time period. The basic plot is that some combat personel called marines and sent to investigate a colonly which has been destroyed by an Alien life form. The marines transport is destroyed by the Aliens and with it most of their ammunition. They have to hold out for half a day until a rescue ship can be piloted down from orbit to rescue them. <br />The attraction of the film is the plot density and the characterisation. A lot of science fiction films have simple linear plots and the characters fall into a narrow range of sterotypes. <br />Aliens has a large range of characters all of whom are interesting and none fall into the simple patterns of good guy, female love interest or cannon fodder. <br />The other aspect of the film is its pace. Once the marines land on the colony the film exudes tension and menance. The action scenes are convincing and heart renching. And of course the film is significant in having a female lead who has a real role instead of being a love interest.<br />Probably the best science fiction film made and one of the better films in any catagory.
B00005YXZH|4.0|I am really amazed at the reviews (both positive and negative) stating that this is Wilco trying to be Radiohead or whatever. Someone even made the GRAND statement that Tweedy was trying to sound like Thom Yorke on this album... ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Their voices are NOTHING alike, and Tweedy's close-miked vocals are a completely different style. And just cause they get a little &quot;weird&quot; for some people, suddenly Wilco is Radiohead?? Schwaa??? Come on guys, anyone who has the Flaming Lips' &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; and Grandaddy's &quot;The Sophtware Slump&quot; can definitely see YHF owes far more to those two albums than it does to OKC or Kid A. This is not Wilco going &quot;ambient&quot;, this is them going indie-pop. <BR>Regardless of the genre you want to call it though, it certainly is a good album. Not life-changing or anything, but certainly a nice progression and a solid cd to have in your collection.
B000002UUX|2.0|There is only one reason to buy this album.  Hangar 18.  And if you've heard Immigrant Song by Led Zeppelin, ever, you're going to feel horribly ripped off.  The people that call this a classic are the same people that call Kid Rock the great white hope of rap.

B00004XOWM|4.0|Okay, let's get this straight.  Limp Bizkit does not make good music.  They cannot play their instruments convincingly and the &quot;I'm mad and I'm gonna pout and break stuff!&quot; schtick gets old.  Now that that has been said, let me also state that if you're looking for good old fashioned get your aggressions out because it's just been one of those days kind of music, Limp Bizkit is the best thing going right now.  They're not as whiny as Korn, they don't complain about how they've been mistreated like Staind, they're not going through a country music phase like Kid Rock, and, well, thank God they're not Blink 182.  This is their 3rd album.  It's also their worst.  The good songs are great, but they're few and far between.  3 songs do not and can not carry an album.  If you only have three songs, don't release an album yet.  Wait till you have 8 or 9 good songs.  Especially when one of your good songs is a Lalo Schifrin tune that you can't even play correctly. (note to Limp Bizkit, The theme to Mission Impossible is in 5/4, not 4/4, and it's more menacing the original way)  So with all of my complaining, why 4 stars?  Because Significant Other was a 5 star effort on my list of guilty pleasures that I would never admit that I listen to.  And if you loved Significant Other just that much, then you'd probably only like this one a little bit less.  But if you're like me, and you only bought significant other because Break Stuff is good music to work out to, then skip Chocolate Starfish altogether and buy Charles Mingus' Changes Two.  Remember Rockafeller at Attica...now THAT'S rage in it's highest form...
B00003CXZ4|5.0|After seeing an ungodly number of movies in my time, I sometimes think I've absorbed every plot twist and storytelling gimmick known to the worldwide viewing audience.  Thankfully, I'm sometimes proved, to my delight, to be wrong.  Not to sound too highbrow, but I've watched a lot of movies.<br /><br />Memento was the most refreshing movie I've seen since &lt;i&gt;The Matrix&lt;/i&gt;, which is pretty funny when you consider it has both Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantalione in it.<br /><br />This movie will entertain you, but more importantly it will make you think.  Think about who you are, what defines you, how people perceive you, and how you perceive yourself.<br /><br />If you're IQ is higher than 13, you should be able to get some enjoyment out of this movie.  However, if you ever thought Rocky was in danger of losing against Ivan Drago, avoid this movie.<br /><br />-- JJ Timmins
038533558X|5.0|This was my first Coben novel, and needless to say I was blown away.  I couldn't stop turning the pages and believe me the plot took an unexpected turn every page.  I can't wait to read his previous work.<br />The plot revolves around Will Klein who can't catch a break. The only two women he has ever loved are murdered.  His brother stands accused of killing his high school sweetheart and is an international fugitive. Will isn't sure of his brother's guilt or even if he's alive for that matter. Quite often what seems to be true is not. Each plot twist will keep you reeling.<br />Read it.  You'll love it.
0451191153|5.0|Howard Roark is an architect who dismisses the design practices of the past as a crutch for lesser architects and their impressionable clients. For Roark, form follows function, and there will be no compromise. No matter how hard pressed he is for money. Peter Keating, however, has no such qualms, and is perfectly comfortable with the old-school way of doing things. But he does know his limitations. These he circumvents by having Howard Roark redesign some of the more complicated commissions that come his way. <br />Years pass. Peter Keating rides the crest of a wave with the help of the boss' daughter, Dominique Francon. Howard Roark, on the other hand, struggles from one commission to another. One of them is a property scam which worked out for the better. Another lands him in court because of manipulation of a client by the newspaper columnist, Ellsworth Toohey.<br />Dominique Francon, who had married Peter Keating, leaves and marries the media / property tycoon, Gail Wynand. Peter Keating's world begins to crumble, and  he finds himself begging the influential Ellsworth Toohey for a chance at the government's housing development project, Cortlandt Homes. Ellsworth Toohey invites him to try, well knowing that the chances of him succeeding in the bid are slight, since he suspects that Peter Keating hasn't designed everything he has claimed to.<br />So Peter Keating turns to Howard Roark, begging him to secretly design the project. His plea is accepted on the proviso that under no circumstances, whatsoever, is the design to be diverted from. Peter Keating agrees, signs a secret contract with Howard Roark, and has Ellsworth Toohey submit the design, which is accepted. The project is begun.<br />Returning from a yachting trip, with Dominique  and Gail Wynand, some months after the commencement of the project, it transpires that Peter Keating has been forced to acquiesce, mutilating the original design. None too surprised, Howard Roark decides to dynamite what has been constructed of the Cortlandt Homes project and take his chances in court....       <br />Read as a work of fiction, and not as a Trojan horse for the Rand Manifesto, my opinion is:<br />There is a lot of eye-poppingly bad and redundant literary prose, as unnecessary to the story as gargoyles and Athenian arches would be on a Howard Roark building.<br />The use of mixed viewpoint robs the reader of a more direct understanding as to why some of the characters have some of the extreme attitudes that they have. Having Dominique Francon issue streams of  almost incomprehensible dialogue to have someone else say  they don't have a clue what she's talking about is hardly the best way to involve the reader. <br />There are occasions when the logic is a bit skewed. For example, Dominique encounters Howard at her father's granite quarry and wonders what such a noble specimen of manhood is doing breaking ( unyielding ) rocks. She contrives a way to meet him at her home. The means she chooses is to damage a marble slab fronting the fireplace in her bedroom. Howard appears as instructed and lectures her on all the types of marble available and how it is vital that she obtain the correct grade. Dominique doesn't give any thought to how a rock-breaker would be so articulately knowledgeable on the subject of marble. And so she doesn't make any attempt to have her earlier wonderment answered. Details such as this are quite a common failing, its rectification  subordinated to the eye-poppingly bad prose.<br />Even so, The Fountainhead is obviously written by someone who is tremendously skilful at integrating a plethora of sub-elements; can create a sense of high drama; and can cut through the utter mush that prevails in the world today.
B00005JL3A|5.0|For first off the movie resident evil was an excellent one at that.i feel as others do also that the director Paul Anderson did a well job of bringing this popular video game to the big screen. The movie was exciting to see that nearly kept your heart<BR>pounding to the last few momments of the movie. An especially the end of the film.This movie also brings the creatures like the zombies to life in a new kind of way,including the new enemy<BR>we saw as the licker.The cast was most the best to see in the film with new faces and some familars like Milla jovovich and Michelle rodriguez.but in all i am a big fan of this film and im most joyful until this movie comes out on dvd july 30 of 2002 and awaiting the sequal to this film resident evil.Overall this movie is both enjoyable and freaky for both teens and adults too.
6304712936|5.0|This movie ''Amadeus'' is the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life! I watch it all the time! I can memorize practically the entire movie! This is a beautiful portrayal of the life and works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Even though some is fictitious, it still entertains in an educational way. It plays some of Mozart's greatest works like Symphony 25 in G Minor, The Abduction from the Seraglio, The Marriage Of Figaro, Don Giovanni and my personal favorite the Requiem Mass. I would never have discovered the beauty of Mozart's music and never would have learned of his genius if it wasn't for this film. So if you want to discover real music or just want to watch the greatest movie of all time, I advise ''Amadeus'' to anyone. May Mozart's spirit and music be with us all forever! God Bless You!
B00004TRD8|5.0|Now, I don't actually know if this is the Ultimate Edition, since the preview picture has the cover of the Special Edition, the one with almost no special features.  The Ultimate Edition I bought at Fye, at a slightly higher cost, but I knew it was the right edition.  It has T2 on it in metal foil.  There are so many hidden extras and special features, and the menus themselves kept me occupied for about a half hour.  I recommend this movie to anyone.  ANYONE.
B00005RYKU|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed The Glass House.  The film has some of the usual cliches in the genre.  People popping out of dark corners, people hiding in obvious locations (like under the bed) and not getting caught, people coming back to life after getting mutilated a couple thousand times.  But for some reason, I really got into the film and was able to look over those cliches, and I actually didn't think much of them.  It is not a classic and is somewhat predictable, but it is sufficiently engrossing and effective to hold interest.<br />All in all, The Glass House is well-worth the money, whether you rent it or buy it.
6304711875|1.0|For me, \\"Scream\\" is just a gore, teen, stupid, oversexed and horribly overrated version of John Carpenter's classic, \\"Halloween\\". More than a homage, it's a copy. Remember: 'Go to the McKenzie's house, call the police'. Doesn't this remind you something? Sure it does! There's nothing new in this movie, nothing at all. The main characters are just pretty, baby-faced and very willing fans of horror movies who don't ask for much else but getting stabbed and the killer's suit is grotesque, making him look more like a mental creep than a ghost (and ridiculized by the Wayans Brothers in their raving film, \\"Scary Movie\\" - Wazaaaaaah!) And what about the killer himself, what about his personality, his UNIVERSE? We're pretty far away from \\"Seven\\", \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" and also \\"Halloween\\" where Michael Myers becomes a killer only at the age of 6, and loses his humanity after a 15-year stay in a psychiatric hospital. In \\"Scream\\", young Billy Loomis turns suddenly into a mass killer and guess why? Only because his father betrayed his mother, who moved away and abandoned him! For a serial killer, the motive is very thin, and for me, it's not enough...<br />The ending is disappointing, if not ridiculous. All those characters who get killed but come back, just because they're 'good', as a matter of fact it makes them unhuman, look like Michael Myers himself, some kind of undestroyable people, and this is dangerous and no good... That female reporter who crashes in her van but comes back to save Sidney just in time, that goofy teenager who gets shot in the chest but comes back to life just in front of Sidney, in perfect condition, that police officer who's stabbed in the back but is found alive, on a stretcher... what d'you want me to say? This happy ending's too big to be honest. In \\"Halloween\\", Michael Myers is the only one to come back, because he's not human any more, the others die for good, they won't be coming back, and that's logical. \\"Scream\\" is maybe a homage, but it's abusive and not logical. And that's why it's disappointing and, above all, a nuisance for kids.<br />The only positive element of this failure is an astounding young actor, Skeet Ulrich. The rest is no new and no good. \\"Scream\\" is the movie that not only (re)started the horror movie fashion in the 90s, but also started the teen - stupid and immature - movie style itself. Such horrible movies like \\"American Pie\\", \\"Not another teen Movie\\" or \\"Harvard Man\\" wouldn't have been made without \\"Scream\\".
B00005JKCF|5.0|Look, folks, what exactly are you complaining about?  This movie had almost everything right!  Well, let's get the bad stuff out of the way:<br />Green Goblin's Costume - Personally, I think it may have been better if they just spent ten bucks on green makeup and a purple hat and cape than that mask and mecha thing they had going on.<br />Organic Web-shooters - 'Nuff said.<br />The Ending - Well, it leaves questions for the next one, huh?<br />OK, then, genius, what was so right with it?<br />Acting - All the way!  Maguire perfectly encapsulates nerdish shyness and superhero charisma (plus, you gotta respect a guy who had to bulk up without meat, so he did it with tofu.  Yes, pounds upon pounds of tofu.)  Kirsten Dunst managed to pull out a great performance, despite my abject and complete hatred of her.  Whoever played JJJ was spot-on.  I am still freaked out by Willem Dafoe's incredible dual-performance.<br />CGI - Yeah, that's right.  I liked the CGI.  Flame me as much as you want, I don't care.  It just looked right.  Have any of you out there actually seen a spider move?  The CGI is supposed to be unbelievably fast!  <br />Long and short of it:  Spider-man fans should see this movie.  Action movie fans should see this movie.  Everyone who enjoys two hours of escapism should see this movie.  Excelsior, True Believers!

630460291X|1.0|Having loved the Robin Hood movie when it came out, and been one of the first to buy it on VHS, I was looking forward to the DVD quality. Alas, this DVD is poorly-done in almost every way. The movie is split halfway through--you literally have to flip the DVD over to see the second part of the movie, although nothing tells you so or prompts you for it--the Supplemental Features are disappointing (and frequently error-laden), and there's truthfully no reason to buy this DVD if you have the VHS already (or a poorly-recorded copy from off the air). The studio really dropped the ball on this one; they need to re-master the DVD. Don't waste your money.
B0000026DJ|4.0|&quot;Diesel and Dust&quot; marked the peak of popularity for Australian troubadors Midnight Oil (in America, anyway).  The single &quot;Beds are Burning&quot; was staple on American rock radio in the late 1980s, which is interesting since a close listen to the lyrics will reveal that the song is about Aboriginal land rights, not exactly the kind of topic that normally inspires large sales.  The fact is, the song's fantastic hook is what sold it.  That is also true on the rest of the album, especially on tracks like &quot;The Dead Heart&quot; (the follow up single to &quot;Beds&quot;), &quot;Warakurna,&quot; &quot;Sometimes,&quot; amd &quot;Bullroarer.&quot;  The rest of the songs fill in well among the highlights.<br />Overall, Midnight Oil had the talent to become the Australian U2 had they toned down the (leftist) politics in their lyrics and concentrated instead on the musical side of things.  Even so, this is still an excellent album.
B00005RFAI|4.0|OK, so I thought she was hot in that video she did for Moulin Rouge, but I wasn't a huge fan of her music until I listened to songs like My Vietnam, Just Like A Pill, 18 Wheeler, and of course the title track Missundaztood.  This is one of those CD's that you put in, hit play, and never skip forward.  By now, most of us are familiar with songs like Don't Let Me Get Me and Get The Party Started, but the other songs on this album like Family Portrait, Dear Diary, and the duet with Steven Tyler called Misery are every bit as intoxicating.  Pink has managed to surprise me with her range and this will undoubtedly be remembered as a career cementing album.

0375408266|5.0|This novel is one I would classify as a \\"tale\\" because it has the moral weight and simple elegance of one of Hawthorne's tales. There are few characters in this tale. And the two main characters seem to represent so much. These two characters are the narrator, Michael Berg, who begins his account with the story of how he lost his virginity at age 15 to a 36 year old streetcar conductor named Hanna Schmitz, and the streetcar conductor herself, whose life continues to interlace with Berg's. Their story spans a period of about thiry years, a period long enough for Michael to learn much about pride, guilt, shame, disappointment, and the ability of human beings to numbly accept just about any degree of indignity. At first I was taken aback by the affair between the schoolboy and the conductor (were the sexes reversed, I wondered whether most readers would have been either outraged or guiltily titilated). But, in the end, the narrator seems to come to a point where he has a perspective on how he had been exploited. Indeed, this experience of exploitation seems to parallel even greater forms of human exploitation and becomes key to understanding many of the other things that unfold in this tale. The way the story progresses is truly masterful and to describe the plot would deprive readers of their own first impressions. Schlink seems to have William Faulkner's gift to force readers to reconsider each character's merits chapter after chapter. If you can, stay away from any review that reveals too much about the storyline. Surrender to the experience of discovery and reflection.<br />This brief novel seems grounded in major philosophical and theological issues--like the roles of conscience and the will. In fact, the stunning paragraph on pp. 19-20 about conscience (\\"Often enough in my life I have done things I had not decided to do.\\") seems to come right out of St. Paul (\\"I can will what is right, but I cannot do it. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do.\\" Romans 7:18,19). The nature of evil and moral lassitude is at the very heart of this book. Another association: The narrator's description of his desire to achieve numbness on a skiing trip called to mind the conversation between the man and the woman about indifference in Marguerite Duras's screenplay for \\"Hiroshima Mon Amour\\" (ISBN 0802131042). This association may be especially apt considering that Renais's film involves painful recollections of the World War II experiences of a French woman who was ostracized for her love affair with a German soldier and of a Japanese man's experience of the Hiroshima bombing.<br />The \\"tale-like\\" quality of the story also made me wonder if the reader wasn't being asked to make something of the main characters' names. \\"Berg\\" is somewhat ethnically ambiguous; \\"Michael\\" is the name of one of the militant angels; \\"Hanna\\" means \\"grace\\" and was the name of a pious Jew in the Hebrew Bible.<br />\\"The Reader\\" is a powerful story.

B000002513|5.0|This crazy record is Bruce's 2nd LP, released 2 years before 'Born to Run.'  He's never sounded like this since.  Featuring upbeat &amp; funky music, entertaining stories, &amp; totally unique images, one can understand why this record had east coast rock lovers waiting so anxiously for a follow up.  Like many of Springsteen's albums, this is arguably his best.  Unlike anything else in his catalog.

1577311523|1.0|Well, it sounds a lot like \\"A World Tour of Wisdom\\" by David James, and that book was much better, more exciting, (certainly a lot funnier) and it actually helped me. This book didn't. The former wasn't a best seller, but it was a lot more realistic and not so \\"free-floating-I'm-now-an-enlightened-master\\" type of tone. This \\"NOW\\" stuff is still selling probably because the content is nothing more than the right set of words and spiritual jargon put together in the \\"right\\" order which tends to sell books. So what! Does that mean the book on \\"now\\" has a past, a now, and probably a future...hence, the \\"philosophy\\" or belief system espoused by the author of \\"NOW\\" is looking forward (no pun intended) to future paychecks? The overall direction of the book is linear (words tend to do that, and not stay in the now) and therefore I think the book falls far short of its highly marketed goal. And yet, Tolle must be very happy knowing that no sequels will ever come about AFTER this book, since that would be, by definition, projecting a future (not a wise decision, considering that it's not okay to not be in the now). I guess that's enough for now, so, I'm going to \\"blank\\" my mind here (as Sylvia Browne says), and go read something else that has time/space/linear logic to it -- lest I suffocate in this \\"now\\" because I can't take these snake-oil peddlers anymore who claim to be so enlightened. Yeah, and if that's true, then why do all of 'em need to sell anything? Enough is enough. Get real! Don't bother with this one because just by reading it means that THAT act alone will take you out of the \\"now\\" and into thoughts, emotions, time and space, and god knows what else. (I'm going to stop now and just be now, okay?)
B00005Q45W|1.0|Sorry!  Especially that everything about this CD disappoints.  Where are the Arts Police?
B000002U82|2.0|If you like slow songs with glossy production and sound effects you might like this. Play it while watching Gone with the wind. Turn the sound off on the TV and start this cd right after  the MGM lion roars twice. Play the Lp on 45 speed and it synchs up even better. After the song Us and Them pause Gone with the Wind for exactly 2 minutes and 14 seconds.Press play again as the chicken-sqauking guitar solo in Any Colour You Like begins. Cosmic! This is actually a big reason millions of people bought this cd- to watch the way it synchs with the Clark Gable classic. The record company promoted this aspect when the album came out in '73. If you play Time backwards at the beginning you will hear the message &quot;gone with the wind is the reason for all these clock sounds&quot;. Way cool,dude. If only Gilmour wrote more lyrics for this one. His lyrics are so deep! Much more evolved than his guitar playing.I also like the art work and the hidden dollar signs in the pyramids. However, without Gone with the Wind it really  is slow and not very energetic. It sounds good if you are about to fall asleep. Kinda like the grateful dead.Slow music for tired people. This band never plays hard enough to sweat, that's for sure.
0679720200|4.0|Camus has made a real classic with his book The stranger. Camus provides readers with a glimpse into the life of a young Frenchman named Mersault. The first line of the book is one of the most famous lines in literature. the line shows Mersault's affection for his mother. The telegram Mersault recieves does not tell when his mother died, only the fact that she did die. In the Book Mersault has a girlfriend by the name of Marie. Marie is somewhat a bandage for Mersault after his mother dies. althought Mersault's mothers death does not affect him totally, he still needs help coping with it. throughout the whole book Mersault does not take stands on his views towards different events in the book. i think Camus was trying to tell where neutrality can get you. i enjoyed this book very much, and im a teenager by the age of 16. you should pick this book up, its short, sweet, and has soo much meaning to it, its astounding.
B00003CXI1|5.0|...this is a very special DVD. The fabulous movie aside, this has to be one of the most accomplished DVD's ever....everything from the guided tour of Hogwarts, to trips to Diagon Alley, to the time it takes to finally get the Philosophers Stone (which you have to find in order to reveal the deleted scenes)....everything is done so superbly & presented impeccably.....<br />...Overall? Fabulous!!!
B000065U1N|5.0|This is one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen in my whole life. I left the movie theather amazed with the story of that men. I'm sure that the survivors of that sad story are very thankfull to all the staff involved in the movie production for reliving their stories with such amazing reality. May the love and pride of that men for their people live in the hearts of each one of us. Congratulations to you all that made this an act no one will forget.
0140288503|3.0|I feel almost unpatriotic in giving Black Hawk less than a 5 star rating.  However, this story just did not work for me.  I consider it FAR from the military classic others apparently do.  By now, most of us know the drill: this is the account of the disastrous incursion to Somalia in early 1993 to capture a warlord. 18 GIs were killed in action and many more wounded. Since this took place very early in the Clinton Administration, I've always wondered if the outgoing George Bush didn't send in the original US troops as a \\"parting present\\" to the incoming President.  BH is not a first hand account but reconstructed through interviews and solid research. The author had the obvious cooperation of the military in so doing but the result is nonetheless second hand, reconstructed and even muddled.  I found it difficult to keep track of the men.  Also, given the small geographic scope of the action, I found it even harder to tell where all the units were.  As so often happens in military books, MAPS are inadequate.  BH soars when it concentrates on individuals, their backgrounds, barracks life, families, wives and girl friends back home.  Some of the ladies left behind are the most compelling characters in BH, especially those whose guys don't return.<BR>This may be the lowest rating of the 405 reviews of BH, but one has to call shots as he sees them. I'll be the first to admit that amazon readers may wish to keep scrolling down.  This review is NO reflection on the brave Rangers, \\"D boys\\" and 10th Division troops who fought and died in this engagement.
B000001G89|5.0|I just adore Teresa Berganza, what an artist! what a voice!<BR>You would be insane to buy any other Carmen.
B00005ATQI|5.0|Unbelivibly scary!  I almost wet my pants watching this movie! I could not stop thinking about this movie! I saw it when I was eleven and the horrifying music woke me up at 2 in the morning playing in my head over and over like a record!  I have watched this movie four more times since then though, and loved it every time!  It is one of my favorite subjects to talk about with my dad! I bought the book and love all of the stuff and detail in it that was not in the movie like the hedge animals. Two things really bug me about the movie though. Did the lady in the bathtub scene really have to be so graphic and embarrasingly reavealing? I was scared and grossed out at the same time. Also, Dick Halloran was important to survival in the book, but in the movie he comes all that way and dies! What a ripoff! Also, Bill Watson made roll on the floor with laughter in the book because of his dirty talking humor about the woman in the tubs history when she was at the hotel and her grandson! He uses the F word almost constantly! As for acting, VERY good! Especially Jack Nichoson! Here's Jhonny! I will never forget this movie and You should go see it very soon!
B00003CWN3|1.0|How many things wrong with this movie, let me count the ways-<BR>Let's see-a woman, masquerading as a man, who is raped and killed?  This would be just some little story no one paid any attention to, ever, but when Hollywood gets its claws into it, you see Drew Barrymore at some award show praising his/her \\"bravery.\\"  Bravery?  Bravery!  There are scientists out there everyday saving people's lives, humanitarian workers, authors, freedom fighters, doctors, pro bono lawyers, journalists, photographers, really helping the world but money, attention, time and awards are given to a film with such a big nothing?  Did this person contribute anything to the world?  Books, writings, a legacy-none.  Would have been a big nobody if she/he wouldn't have been killed.<br />Another galling thing about this movie is that its another case of Hollywoodization of a true story, like Beautiful Mind or Schindler's List.  The real Lana dropped Brandon/Tenna/liar as soon as she found out she/he was missing one important thing in a boyfriend.  Those two hicks who murder him/her/it made these really showy apologies at the trial-then laughed about them.  <br />I watched this on Bravo because I didn't want to waste the time renting it.  I was mildly curious and got quite a eye full even from the cut Bravo version.  This movie made me ill-and not just for the rape/sex/humiliation/brutal murder scenes.  It was so heavy handed, so preachy-your talking about a bunch of rednecks in Nebraska-these people behaved like they were in Soho.  It rams down our throats the point that we have to accept this behavior. We don't.  Under different circumstances, he/she would have been in a mental institution or at least having one hell of an operation.  <br />Chloe \\"fashion icon\\" bothered me the most-like any girl in Nebraska is going to look or talk like that.  Ever.  Same goes for the others-just like the holier than thou New York \\"art\\" crowd moved to Nebraska and decided to make a movie about their \\"hero\\" or\\"heroine\\" or whatever.
0553106635|5.0|All three books were terrific...original plot, and characters of every kind.  It is a grey world in the Song of Ice and Fire series - nobody is completely good; nobody is completely evil.  Also, there are so many different storylines going on together that the promise of the different threads coming together just makes you beg for the next installment of this series.  Also, it takes a tremendously talented author to \\"stay in character\\" when he's switching from the point of view of one character to another character, but George R. R. Martin does it beautifully.

B00005ARDC|2.0|BRMC are the latest &quot;Buzzband&quot; and I can't quite figure out why.  It's not a bad disc, but if I really wanted to listen to the Jesus &amp; Mary Chain, I'd pull out my J&amp;MC discs. So, SO, derivative.  Let's hope they grow some personality of their own to go with their rockin' attitude.
B000002JPA|5.0|as much as one can speak about the depth of dream theater's musical ability, they often mistake them for a &quot;progressive&quot; band. <br />like rush and yes of a forgotten age, dream theater combine amazing songwriting and instrumentation with genuine SOUL in both lyrics and melody. this album is by far dream theater's greatest effort, because they don't stick to one simple theme or style of writing. for example, the contrast between songs like &quot;pull me under&quot; (reminds me of queensrchye) which is both moody and melodic. and &quot;Take The Time&quot; that features 80's style funk guitar playing (slap guitar?) and great dixie dregs styled riffs that groove. (john petrucci himself a huge Morse fan.) and then there is the shred opus &quot;metropolis pt. 1&quot; which is really just a song for the guitars to indulge into time signature excess, and theres a phenomenal two handed bass solo from the billy sheehan o' koreans, john myung.  <br />dream theater can do it all, and not at the expense of writing good likeable songs. dream theater is not a progressive band, they are artists. images and words, their finest hour. a gem for all music fans.

B000002HRE|1.0|I'm not going to rag about Metallica being sell-outs. I'll simply say that creativity, originality, musical integrity...and BALLS...are lacking in this record AND in Load. Metallica have become a parody of themselves, de-evolving into [junk]. A friend of mine suggested I give a band called Dream Theater a try, the AWAKE album specifically. I haven't turned back.
B00005RY7X|4.0|I don't like ALL the songs on this album, but the majority of them rock. Even my dad, who can't STAND hard rock, was bobbing his head to this album. All of these songs are fast, heavy, and fun, with an emphasis on FUN. This is definitely an album you could play at just about any party (unless it's a wake, of course).<br />When I first heard the song &quot;It's Time to Party&quot; on TV (it was some obscure travel commercial), I honestly thought it was some new-schol punk rock band. Instead, I found out it was Andrew W.K. and his crazy brand of rock. This album is fun to listen to: it's loud, crazy, and gives it's listeners more energy than any rock album should.
6305127689|5.0|Everyone searches for that movie that perfectly blends romance with action. That one movie that seamlessly interweaves steamy or sweet love with plane crashes and intense action sequences. Many movie set out to do this, &quot;Top Gun&quot; achieves it and then some. This not a &quot;boy&quot; movie, nor is it a &quot;girl&quot; movie...but a beautiful combination of both. Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis shine in their leading roles, but they are nearly outshone by Anthony Edwards as Goose. One could write a long, fluid review of the movie...but it does not seem appropriate. This film is straight to the point, clear cut and keeps you on the edge of your seat from its audacious beginning to its equally spirited ending. A rough-n-tumble action flick and at the same time a sweet and sincere romance. <br />Top notch movie. Definitely enhances anyones DVD or VHS collection.
B00003CXI1|1.0|This is one of the worst DVDs that have been produced yet. The cover of the DVD says that it is a special edition. There are two discs to the DVD set, and only two special features: theatrical trailers, and 7 useless deleted scenes. The second disc is a bunch of tedious \\"tour of hogwarts\\" and \\"360 degree perspective of Hagrids hut\\" and if you click on a golden snitch, the little voice says \\"this is the golden snitch it is wonderful and very hard to catch, blah blah\\". To get to the deleted scenes, you must first go to Gringotts and get money, then go to the wand shop and try out a billion different wands, then you must go to the lessons, then you have to try and mix potions (if you do it wrong you go back to the beginning)and then you have to choose a potion (if you choose the wrong one, its back to the beginnning) and then the Philosephers Stone is revealed,and you get seven totally irrelevent and boring deleted scenes.<br />As well as the DVD being a major dissapointment, the movie itself is nothing short of terrible. Harry Potter can NOT act, the SFX are terrible (very very bad [i cannot state this enough]), major bits have been left out, the dark elements of the story have been cut out giving it a cheesy \\"happy\\" feeling.<br />overall, buy the VHS or rent it. This is not value for money.
B00000ADG2|5.0|This album puts Lauryn Hill much further ahead of Alicia Keys, India Arie and even Erykah Badu!<BR> Undoubtedly the best r and b album of the 90's, &quot;The Miseducation&quot; has both haunting melodies and very powerful lyrics. And, unlike so many other r and b albums, there is a variety of different sounds. Lauryn can go into many different modes, the best being the &quot;soul diva Aretha Franklin&quot; mode and the &quot;beats for da streets hip hop&quot; mode.<BR> One of the best albums ever made.
B00005JKCF|2.0|I wanted to like this movie a lot.  But I was disappointed.  The film dragged in places and was obviously heading for a sequel.  The special effects were good, but couldn't move the film up in my estimation.  The best part of the film was when he was trying to figure out how to shoot his web from his wrist.  Having spent my $[money], I walked out of the theatre wishing I had spent it on renting two other films at my local video store.
0553260111|5.0|I thought that this was a really great book. I don't usually read these kind of books but I thought this was good.There was action and romance, it was exciting. It had a good climax and story line too. Trust me it's worth your time to read this book.
0446608955|5.0|I loved this book! I couldn't put it down! I liked the way the way Spark's described the characters and the way that he made them seem so down to earth. I felt like I could relate to the characters.
0385505833|1.0|I picked this book up around Christmas 2001 &amp; it is now May 2002 &amp; I still can not finish it - I've suffered through the first 80 pages and just can not take anymore.  I love John Grishman &amp; everything's he's ever written - except this one. I will finish it someday - hopefully before next Christmas &amp; perhaps revised this review at that time.
B00004YZFR|5.0|Hey dudes, <br />Just want to check in.  I was that Cat on the stage with Mick that was having that bad acid trip.  Hey Man, those Angels didn't need to treat me like they did, man... Wheeeewwww!  What a night!<br />Seriously,  a must see if you are a fan of The Rolling Stones, the 60's, History, The Hell's Angel's or dudes having bad acid trips... Right up there in terms of cultural importance with the Woodstock movie...  The only disapointment of &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; is the fact that the Maysles Brothers left out the concert footage of P. Diddy and the Bad Boys for Life Crew... I think they were there... I mean, aren't they everywhere...?
038533558X|5.0|This is why people love thrillers.  First, there's a solid premise: Will's beloved brother, accused of murder and long gone, may be found again -- and may be innocent.  Second, Coben ratchets up the plot on every page.  Is Will's beloved brother really lost?  And is he really beloved?  Is the soulmate really his true love?  What is she hiding?  And third, the characters drive the story -- not the other way around. Every character has a secret.  No one is who they seem to be. Every new piece of information gives you new insight -- always surprising, but always logical.  Don't start reading until you're prepared not to stop.  (And if you're lucky enough not to have read Tell No one yet, do that too.)
B000063DGC|5.0|I'm glad in this latest reissue of this classic album they've restored the longer clip of the intro number Carmina Burana from the original lp.Listening to it one could get the feeling that perhaps Randy had seen the movie Excalibur and seeing King Arthurs Knights charge forth to one more victory during that piece,it seemed an image that could sit well with Ozzy aswell.<BR>Listening to this particular section always gave me chills as the  music slowly faded in,you hear the roar of the crowd as the band enters,Ozzy's extended elation filled remarks,than bang like a sledge hammer Randy's first guitar burst just hits you like a lightning bolt,and it continues from there...<BR>More hair raising on the opening and closing strains of crazy train,the solo to suicide solution,the list could go on.<BR>It's hard to believe now that during this particular point of his career,Ozzy's first shows as a solo artist were almost universally greeted by the press with negative reviews.This was the era that saw him bight the head off a bat and dove,saw him pissing on the alamo,and saw him pegged by various religious organiztions as the human embodiment of the prince of darkness himself.<BR>So while the media was concentrating on the controversial aspects<BR>both on and off stage of Ozzy,something very special was going on<BR>to which I'm sure alot of those same reviewers had now wished they'd been more objective.<BR>Taken alledgedly from two shows taped in Montreal and Indianapolis,this recording finds Ozzy and the band in fine form.<BR>If anyone had any doubts as to Ozzy's intentions during this period one could hear it in his stage chatter here.<BR>And if you thought this was an amazing night like I did when I first heard this album,you'd be floored that amongst alot of tape collectors that at least I knew this was just average for them.One recording in particular I remember was I believe a radio<BR>broadcast for some Swedish radio station,and I remember playing that for one of my friends and seeing her jaw drop.<BR>And as for that guitar solo,it was an ever evolving thing from Randy's Quiet Riot stay.Later on during the tour it eventually begins to evolve into band jam session complete with it's own mucial interlude...But what those and alot of other tapes in circulation don't have is the clarity in sound production.So whilst it may be cool to search around for that live version of other Diary tracks like Over the Mountain from this period (which<BR>believe it or not got alot of radio airplay back than but seldom performed)this is the album I bet you'd return to time and time again for your guitar fix.Listening to it one could easily picture these guys blowing even the mighty Van Halen off stage.Highly recommended.
B000062X9B|5.0|This cd is dynamic.  As a young person who is a huge Johnny fan, I believe this cd bettered Unchained in a crossover recording that introduces Johnny to an entirely new audience.  He uniquely covers a few popular modern songs while singing a few classic Johnny style songs.  &quot;I see a darkness&quot; brings a tear to my eye every time I sing along with him.  <br />In addition to his own class, other popular artists have the honor of performing with the legend, as well as a great duet with Merle Haggard.  This is a true gem.
B000063T0T|4.0|If you have already purchased the first two Moulin Rouge individual soundtracks, then do not waste your money buying this one.  All the tracks are the same (and in the same order) as the first two discs.  There is only a single &quot;Lady Marmelade&quot; remix added.<br />Of course all the music in this edition is absolutely fantastic.  But having purchased the first two single discs, I already knew that.  I would have hoped that this disc would at least have put the songs from the two discs together in ORDER that they appear in the movie...but it isn't so.  Basically it's like having the same two discs, in a different case.<br />If you have not purchased either of the previous soundtracks, then I WOULD recommend buying this one.  Most of the songs directly from the movie are on here, and the instrumentals are beautiful...it's funny how a simple song (&quot;Your Song&quot;) can take on such different meanings depending on the tempo/dynamic/instrumentals used.  The instrumentals really show how well the music fit the mood of each scene.<br />There are some songs from the movie NOT included on here, that I really want to hear, including the Green Fairy bit, some of the intro dance mixes, and the final Satine/Christian/company song.  Maybe there will be another collector's edition that we can pay even more money for, that will include all these songs.  <br />Until then, enjoy this music which I highly recommend, unless you have already purchased the previous single discs.
0446608955|3.0|Nicholas Sparks' A Walk to Remember was not the fantastic book I had anticipated it would be.  I would rate it a 3 out of 5.  Having been a best seller, I expected a bit more from the novel.  As far as literary merit goes, I saw none.  Sparks' writing lacks use of any symbolism or motifs and contains poor excuses for what were intended to be examples of foreshadowing.  His characters are undeveloped and his plot, predictable.  I suppose I should have considered my distaste of the dullness of the movie Message in a Bottle before purchasing A Walk to Remember.  On a better note, I will hand it to Sparks for creating a refreshingly moral demonstration of teenage life; a rarity these days.  His wholesome humor and drama are sure to please someone but as far as I am concerned, I'll stick to looking for something deeper in 200 pages.
6301978137|5.0|This move was a great move and addition to the two Conan parts but I do have a question if anyone can answer it.  When is this movie going to come over to DVD?  I have been looking forward to it and want to own it as soon as it makes the change.  From the way that it appears this movie is exactly like Conan but for me personally I think that it is alot better than both of the Conans givign Arnold an edge and not so much hype.
B00005JKJA|5.0|It may have taken him a while to come to a fully formed interpretation, but Sticky has emerged with a sound appreciation of the allegorical nature of Lynch's Mulholland Drive.<br />At its core, the film bears witness to the importance of proper eating habits - choosing food judiciously, chewing carefully, and digesting properly. Clearly the free-wheeling nightmare endured by Diane in the first half of the film is induced by the following chain of events:<br />- big session of sticky rice eating<br />- heavy session of wild jitterbugging!<br />- huge cat nap<br />There is a lesson for us all here...<br />Note to self: go easy on the dance floor.
B000002KET|5.0|First of all I don't want to get into the eternal and interminable arguments about which album is best of the classic six. I hear you all and you all have your valid points but I'm sticking with this one. It was the first one of theirs I ever heard too many years ago and I was instantly enslaved. Time has done nothing to weary me of it. It sounds as fresh and vital to me now as it did then. It gave me a kick start into rock `n' roll and showed me what heavy metal was all about. I guess my fate was sealed from the opening riffs of the title track `Sabbath Bloody Sabbath'. What an awakening. They move effortlessly from darkest, deepest, ominously heavy to melodically acoustic on an album so versatile in nature and composition it defies easy classification. Of course it's heavy metal but it's heavy metal with IQ. Often accused of bludgeoning home their message and stating the obvious Sabbath's lyrics on here bear a closer scrutiny (and in hindsight so do their earlier albums and if all you ever saw was what was on the surface then that's your problem not theirs). Sublety was perhaps never their forte but irony was and songs such as `Who Are you?' and `Killing Yourself to Live' are perhaps as bitingly acidic lyrically as it gets. `Sabbra Caddabra' just plain rocks there is no other way to put it and once again they leaven all that heaviness with the lightest of touches in the aptly named `Fluff' without compromising an iota of their credibility as hard men of rock. It's scary just how accomplished a product this is for its time - for any time. It has a timeless appeal and is a lesson in humility to any aspiring nu metal outfit out there.
B000021XS0|5.0|This album is fantastic! I can't imagine a better album. This concept album is about the murder of a young woman. All the lyrics belong to different characters. The album is also like a movie, with two acts. Each act has a number of scenes, and each scene contains either one or two tracks. There is a total of 9 scenes and 12 tracks. All the tracks in act1 are linked togheter, and the same goes for act2. So the only silent part of this album is either before you turn it on, after it's done or between the two acts! All this might sound a bit unimportant, but it's not! If you listen two the songs and at the same time try to understand what they're about, it gets so much better! That means, it's getting better than best! Because this album is the best music you'll ever find! Dream Theater at their best! This album still gives me the shivers.. love it! Please buy it, you won't regret it!
B00005QXDD|3.0|JB and KG are very talented musicians.  But their comedy skits, unlike their cool music, are not something I need to hear over and over again.  Don't get me wrong, they're funny, but I'd rather hear them sing and play than do skits.  If they put out another album, I hope it focuses more on tunes and less on comedy skits.  The D recently did an appearance on Kilborn in which they sang Friendship with only their acoustic guitars.  It was totally righteous, better even than the version on this album.
B00005T30L|2.0|It's not a movie that will make you laugh, and one that isn't terribly entertaining, either, though I had huge expectations for the movie (I'm a huge Buscemi fan) and read excellent reviews for the movie.<br />Honestly, it seems like this movie makes fun of the people who watch it and call it 'brilliant'. A girl gets fired from her job at the theatre for not conforming to socially acceptable behaviour...and seems to lose her friend, keep herself from getting a boyfriend, and gets confused in every area of her life because of her boredom of conformity. What makes this brilliant? 'The dialogue is so real'. Big deal. I could watch a flower blooming on a movie screen, but even though it's 'real' doesn't make it entertaining.<br />Some reviewers have shown excitement over the old man at the bus stop scenes in the movie, where he'd basically tell our hero to shut up and go away every time she'd try to convince him that the bus stop is no longer a part of a bus route. This can be compared to the art teacher's reaction to one of her student's scribbling as being a remark on feminism. The makers of the movie put unspectacular characters and unspectacular dialogue on a screen, throw in a few overboard characters to try to create a laugh, and they're hoping people would see the hipness of such blah that they'd convince themselves that they're smart for figuring out the brilliance of the movie.<br />If you're not into kidding yourself about what you're watching, here's what you'll see: Steve Buscemi in his most boring role...as unspectacular as his character from 28 days. Thora Birch, a cute girl with a baby face on a woman's body, dressing in interesting clothing and making negative comments about everything. The negative dialogue is probably supposed to be funny, but it isn't. It's not annoying or upsetting or anything. It's just kinda Blah. Her friend in the movie is Blah. The events of the movie are blah. There's a freaky lookin' guy who frequents the local AM/PM and keeps spouting his American Freedoms. He was pretty funny in outrageous he was, as was the stereotypical greek AM/PM owner (Apu of the Simpsons).<br />Like the movie it's trying to copy, American Beauty, we have a wuss of a parent, some bitter teens, and some freaks. We don't have American Beauty's dialogue. I have no idea why the father was so afraid of his daughter, but to be honest, I really couldn't care less. I didn't care that his daughter had a crush on a boy that clearly wasn't an example of non-conformity (he was just a good looking, hardly-speaking boy).<br />You have two ways to go with this movie. You might be like me and feel like this movie is a waste of your time and not interesting in the least. It had a few funny moments, and I did laugh out loud about three times in the movie. I didn't hate the movie. It just wasn't interesting or entertaining and I'll never see it again.<br />You might also be like those who finds independent films brilliant just because of the fact that they're independent films. You'll analyze this movie to death and make much more out of this movie than is actually there. I suppose that's what the makers of the movie probably want from you. And I think that's what they're trying to make fun of.<br />Pigeon.spouting his American Freedoms.

B00005AWMF|5.0|Well, yes people, the above is strictly subjective opinion on my part.  But I did want to catch your attention by voicing the fact that I don't consider most &quot;Best of&quot; albums all that great.  Maybe that sounds confusing, and one wonders how can a set of the artist's best not be the best album.  <br />A truly outstanding compilation usually is going to have highs and lows.  You need &quot;lows&quot; so that the &quot;highs&quot; stand out.  Also, the better albums have some sort of commonality of material to achieve a cohesive flow, a flow that's hard to maintain in a collection of top hits.<br />This CD struck me very differently, and, with PROMISE, is one of my two favorite Sade albums.  In trying to figure why this &quot;best of&quot; album touched me the way it did, I realized that it's the placing of the material as well as the selection of the material that creates what seems to me as a most pleasing stream of Sade's music.  Mainly, the songs are placed so that you have four groups of hits, arranged by the chronology of the albums they come from.  There is only one exception, the placing of the newest song at the time in the group from LOVE DELUXE.  Thus, there's a feeling of development through the four albums represented.  <br />Also, I believe the selection of songs must have been made with the thought of maintaining a flow.  Selection of &quot;the best&quot; has to be subjective.  At first glance, I had the thought that I myself wouldn't have included &quot;Jezebel&quot; or &quot;Like a Tattoo&quot;, but rather would have picked &quot;Frankie's First Affair&quot;, &quot;War of the Hearts&quot;, &quot;Haunt Me&quot;, &quot;Feel No Pain&quot;, along with the instrumental, &quot;Mermaid&quot;.  However, after listening to this CD a number of times, I believe the producers came up overall with a more enjoyable group than I would've.<br />Another thing I notice is that with this placing, there is a bit of difference as to which songs I feel stand out as the &quot;very best&quot;.  &quot;Your Love Is King&quot;, &quot;Smooth Operator&quot;, &quot;The Sweetest  and I have no argument Taboo&quot;, &quot;Paradise&quot;, &quot;No Ordinary Love&quot;, &quot;Pearls&quot;, each have a unique charm, and yet, how can I argue with anybody who has other favorites.      <br />If you enjoy R &amp; B richly infused with jazz and liberally flavored with the exotic taste of world music, enhanced by Sade Adu's smooth and sultry voice, you'll like Sade.  This obviously would be a first choice for any who don't have anything from this group.  But I personally have all four of the previous albums, and still have a strong affection for this additional one, so even if you have all or most of those first four, you might consider adding this one.  <br />As with each Sade album that I've reviewed, I do caution that this is for those who enjoy a smooth R&amp;B/jazz blend with  controlled vocals rather than wanting a hard driving beat with vocals that are yelled out at you.
B0000399WI|1.0|This paean to middle-aged scofflaws, attempts to persuade the viewer to side with rapists, thieves, and murderers. If Mr. Freeman didn't want to imagine what it was like inside that pipe, then he should avoid viewing this waste of celluloid, I assure you it is 100 times worse. A rampant glorification of gynicide.
B000006JQ5|5.0|A very good introduction to the classic heavy metal band indeed, but I have a few complains, a major complain: This album is too messy. My first complain is: Why in all reasons in the world 'Virus' is the opening track of Maidens' greatest hits?! Don't get me wrong, 'Virus' is an excellent, creative song, and I also understand that it's a brand new song which only appears on 'Best Of The Beast', so maybe because of that they wanted to put it as the opening track, but come on, 'Virus' is too slow and too dark to open the album, and besides I'm sure all fans would be happier if any song by Bruce was the opening track and not the too slow-sung by Blaze 'Virus'.<br />Ok, when 'Virus' ends, 'Sign Of The Cross' is pumping up. Another bad way for the second track. 'Sign of The Cross' is another dark-sung-by-Blaze-song, and also Maiden's second longest song ever, so after the kinda dark and long 'Virus', it is obvious that a fast classic Maiden song should pump up. But no. We get 'Sign Of The Cross', but it's a good song anyway. <br />Ok, when 'SOTC' ends, 'Man On The Edge' is pumping up. Finally a fast song... but why is it on Maiden's greatest hits anyway?<BR>Good fun song indeed but not a classic Maiden song in any way.<br />A few more complains: where is 'Infinite Dreams', or 'Children Of The Damned', or 'Invaders', or 'Killers', or 'The Prisoner, etc? Instead of unnecessary songs like 'SOTC' or 'Man on...' (they should've been selected one of these 2 songs) or 'Holy Smoke' which vocally, is Bruce's worst song ever, which is a shame, or 'Heaven Can Wait' which is unnecessary too, instead of this song for exampe they could've been put other song from &quot;Somewhere In Time&quot;, like 'Stranger In A Strange Land'. I just don't understand the silly arrangement and why some unnecessary songs was selected to Maiden's greatest hits too. I just don't understand it.<br />...But, after all it's contains 2 cd's of Maidens' greatest hits, classic metal songs which will forever remain classic. And if someone is really interested in Maiden songs from all periods, he really should get this album, because it contains most prominent songs of Maiden through all years of Maiden's existance 'til 1996. Let's leave the bad things behind, 5 stars anyway. UP THE IRONS!
B000063V8R|5.0|As so many out there like to say: This is definately one to see.<BR>The Next Generation finally establishes itself with its 3rd season running as one of the most astounding quality series to ever hit tv-screen. It has some very fine shows such as \\"The Defector\\", \\"The Offspring\\", \\"Sarek\\", \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\", \\"Deja Q\\". Not to mention to any serious Fan is the overall excellent episode \\"The Best Of Both Worlds\\", marking the long awaited return of one of the most thrilling villains of the Star Trek-universe: The Borg. This episode works just wonderful in any way. I often thought, that this would have been a truely great blockbuster-movie, at least a hundred times better than \\"Star Trek:Generations\\", if they had used its plot for the big screen instead for television. The idea of having Picard become the leading force of the Borg Invasion is perhaps as easy as it is threatening. Special commendations go to composer Ron Jones; the theme he provided for the Borg surely makes one shiver and raises tensions to the utmost levels. Season 3 sets the high standard for the other seasons to come, and I'm still grateful for this remarkable series with its quality to enlighten us, to entertain us and to make us wonder about mankinds nature and the nature of the universe itself.

B0000636UN|2.0|For those of us who have taken pleasure in the slow but rewarding evolution of Sheryl Crow's music from Tuesday Night Music Club onward, this album is a disappointment.  It seems as though Sheryl Crow has set aside her musicianship and artistic instinct for an album that has all the appeal of the American Express commercial in which its first single, &quot;Soak Up the Sun,&quot; is featured.<br />While never a consistently great lyricist, Crow's songwriting is lazy and just plain bad at numerous points throughout this album.  A perusal of the lyrics from earlier albums reveals clever, knowing songwriting that is peculiarly missing from the current release.<br />Even Sheryl Crow could not pull off this level of banality with tongue in cheek, so it must be cash in hand that drove the release of C'Mon C'Mon and the accompanying photo shoots, commercial promotion and celebrity parade that, until now, seemed very un-Crow.<br />For other fans of &quot;Old Crow&quot; disappointed in this latest turn, I recommend the rare Crow rendition of &quot;All By Myself&quot; and the equally rare singles that can be found on some imported versions of the Tuesday Night Music Club album.  Here's hoping Sheryl Crow returns to fine form when she comes back down to earth.

B00005J9LZ|5.0|that I still listen to this album 15 years after its publication in 1987. I was 15 years old at that time and this album with its smash-hit singles was sweeping around..I was not the die-hard fan then; that would be achieved soon later, with the release of \\"Always On My Mind\\". But this album always dazzled and still dazzles me with the fantastic opening piece \\"One more chance\\" with its cheeky sound, amazing vocal-displaying song by Springfield \\"What have I done To deserve this\\", and the mind-boggling \\"Rent\\". But the last five tracks (side B on those good old LP days) are simply the best five songs I have ever listened to. \\"It's A Sin\\", \\"I want to wake up\\" and \\"Heart\\" always make me up to my feet and dance around, with a sense of sorrow and longing...But the real gems are simply \\"It could not happen here\\" and \\"King\\"s Cross\\", two hard-striking, dark, haunting, heart-piercing ballads: the only two songs that have ever made me cry. Hands down, I cannot help myself but listen to them again&again in a nostalgic deja-vu. I guess I should thank Pet Shop Boys; actually, for what they have all given to me. Will there be any better pop duo or group around? I do not think so and how I wish that Britney Spears or Nsync or other yo-yo (pop)groups or singers just listened to PSB and learnt about lyric-writing, composition and the indispensable thing in music: Songwriting

Lee only highlighted a few key speeches and did not fully explain Malcolm's break from the Nation of Islam. Those who do not know that much about X might be confused as for the reason. His trip to Mecca was depicted well, but the storyline after that is not very strong. For a three hour movie, it did not have a lot of information.

0679720200|4.0|The Stranger<br /> By: Albert Camus<br /> The book that I read was called The Stranger by Albert Camus. The story is a <br />simple novel about a guy named Meursault, a shipping clerk in the North African city of Algiers. He seems to be a very superficial person in all his actions. He finds out about his mothers death and when he goes to his mother's funeral, he isn't in the least bit devastated by her death; this is because he just sees death as a part of life, in my opinion. He finds himself hanging out with some new friends and while \\"Backing up\\" one of them, he shoots and kills one man. He is now in jail and is facing the death penalty, hoping and praying for parole. Then he is visited by the county's chaplain, who makes him realize just how important life is to him. <br /> Meursault is a very unique individual that sees life in a very different way, rather than judging someone, he tries to find out why that person acts that way. The things that he holds dear and cares about are a little different also, he cares a great deal about the little things in life, like swimming and running, instead of things like a big house, or a nice car. Another thing that is a little \\"off\\" that I find is that he doesn't think about how his actions will affect his future life, he kind of \\"lives for the moment\\" instead of planning for the things to come. The last that intrigues me about him is that he doesn't have that much emotion for the things that are going on around him, I think this is because he doesn't want to live up to societies' expectations that everyone behaves a certain way. I think that the reason why he doesn't have everyone else's emotional habits is because he sees things as they are and that's it, he doesn't think about what the outcomes means to him.<br />I think that the title, The Stranger, refers to the main character Meursault. The reason why I think so, is because throughout the whole book you learn plenty about him, but he always seems so very distant to me.The question that arises from this is \\"Why?\\" Why would the author write an entire novel, giving minute details about his train of thought, and his emotions (when they arise) and give obvious effort to keep the man a mystery? I think that the reason is because he wants the reader to relate to Meursault, and learn from his experiences. Another reason that could be the answer is because the author wants the reader to be jealous of him. The grounds that I say is on how everybody wants act without worrying about what everyone else thinks of him or her. Meursault doesn't have a care in the world about how anybody else thinks of him, which is why he finds no need to comply with societies' unwritten laws. This makes people either like him and value his friendship or opinion, or they think he's an insensitive guy.<br />The reason why I picked this book is because my partner, Ray, chose it. The reason why I read this book is because Meursault intrigued me and made me want to continue on and read the book. When you have a character like in The Stranger, by Albert Camus that makes you think it would be great to be able to trade places with for a day, then you can't help but not put the book down. That's what happened to me and that's why I think it is on the honors reading list.
B000005PW0|5.0|Some really stupid but hilarous moments from a great movie from the mid-eighties with all kinds of send-ups, modest crudity, fights, traffic chaos and mad officers. Pity about the sequels though, all the same idea over and over again which took the gloss off this classic.

I was skeptical because most movies that were video games suck badly.  The movie had me thoroughly entertained and on the edge of my seat the whole time.  I can't wait for it to come out on DVD.

B00000K3D4|5.0|Probably one of the msot magical and wonderful stories out there has to Be Labyrinth.  The tale of a young women who wishes her brother away and then msut journey through the land of the goblins to rescue him.  With an incredible performance by David Bowe as the Goblin King this is a movie that everyone must own.<br />This movie took around three years to make if I am correct.  The reason being is the fact that they ahd write a script, the large number of puppet's and characters, and the set design alone could of taken a helluva lot of time.  However when the dust settled and it was all said and done, the team of Jim Henson and George Lucas produced a masterpiece.<br />This is one of my all time favorite childrens films.  Reason being is that one fact, it is magical and phenominal.  I know I didn't say much about the movie its self, but this is just one fo those you have to see to believe.

B00005JLF5|5.0|Star Trek fans, I'm sure, will argue for decades over which of the Trek TV series was the best.  But as a stand-alone Sci-Fi TV series, this one was the best I had ever seen.  Just to let you know where I'm coming from, my other favorites include Blake's 7, Doctor Who, the original Star Trek series, and most of the Next Generation Series (post 1989).<br />Deep Space Nine had it all.  It was the first Star Trek series to be produced after Gene Rodenbury passed away, and I think he would have been very proud.  The series had a grand story arc from the very first episode.  It increased the number of primary characters over that of 'The Next Generation.'  It featured more female characters in commanding roles (most notably, Major Kira).  It mirrored the post Cold War politics and instability of the Balkins / Slovakia / Eastern Europe, with its setup of the dimming Cardassian Empire and the newly-freed Bajorians.  It also addressed the legacy of empires past.  One only needs to see the bond between Chief O'Brien (ethnic Irish) and Doctor Bashir (ethnic Indian) to identify echoes of the British empire.<br />And let's not forget France, or for that matter, Casablanca!  Deep Space Nine was a dense series.  It had action, drama, romance, and a series-long homage to the classic film, Casablanca.  It could have been called, \\"Everyone comes to Quarks.\\"  Quark is no Rick Blaine, but he does own a bar.  And Odo is a very good redux of Captain Louis Renault.  Add to that the familiar story of the spy-turned-tailor in the likeable character of Garak (the only Cardassian aboar DS9).  In any case, it added a depth of romance and humor to the series.  Furthermore, DS9 took advantage of a grand opportunity to further develop the Bajorians, Ferengi, and Cardassians as major players in the Star Trek universe.   <br />And it should be mentioned that although Rick Berman and company downplayed early rumors that the series would be \\"bleak\\" and \\"much darker\\" than the 'Next Generation' series, it was still a very different Star Trek.  The cinematography, set design, and music might have looked and sounded a lot like The Next Generation, but this Trek had a much more realistic storyline, with very powerful and often dark themes.  This Trek had the highest body count of any previous or future series.  Every major planet in the storyline - Earth, Bajor, Cardassia, and Qonos/Klingon are all devastated by major military attacks sooner or later in the series (with one of them nearly being destroyed altogether).  DS9 (the station) itself was originally built as a Cardiassian prison, where countless Bajorians toiled and died.  So although this series is part of the same glossy world as TNG, the themes and scenarios are much more realistic.  This series was about suvival against the odds, and I think it pulled it off wonderfully. <br />This was a grand series about the struggle to survive and build trust among different races and worlds.  And being a Star Trek series, it was also about management - how to manage people, build teams, and solve problems on the fly.  I think any engineer, mechanic, or IT professional would love the new Star Trek shows, including this one for it's never-ending theme of problem solving and the demonstration of leadership skills.<br />But above all, a series can't work unless the characters are well-developed, and the story flows at a steady pace.  And that's where DS9 excelled.  In my opinion, 'The Next Generation' became a great series only when a solid story arc was established, and the crew of the Enterprise-D had acquired multiple missions to deal with the Romulans and fight the Borg.  I assume, that could only be done when the future of the series was secured (thanks to strong ratings in syndication).  DS9 hit the ground running when it premiered in early 1993, thanks, of course, to the success of TNG.  It's characters were very well thought-out (most of them had solid backgrounds and personal interests established from the start), and only grew in depth as the series progressed.  And the story arc was emphasized with some of the greatest season-ending cliffhangers I've ever seen.  It is quite possible that the finale of the 1999 series (I think it was '99) when both Garak and Worf lost their love interests during an attack on DS9, was as dramatic and powerful as anything I had seen on other well-written drama series such as Homicide or Six Feet Under.  In fact, Homicide was the only other TV show I watched between 1993 and 2000.<br />It could be years before all 7 seasons of DS9 are released on DVD.  But let's hope Season #1 is released soon.  And then the journey can begin again.  This was one for the ages for Trekers and non-Trekers alike.
0345350499|5.0|What else can I say that hasn't already been said? This book is FANTASTIC. . . soul-stirring, poignant, emotional, sensitive, everything that you could possibly expect a book to be.  You feel for the characters; you experience their every emotion, every thought, every action, and breathe their air, feel their senses, cry with them, laugh with them, and experience all the intense magic and power of Avalon in a dazzling, moving, spiraling journey into what was, what struggled to be with the rise of Christianity, and what will always remain dear and close to our hearts as some of us return to those ancient, beautiful ways and recognize our kinship with magick and the Earth. This tale gorgeously draws all into a web of delicious reading as it enchants with the tale of Morgaine, Vivianne, Merlin, Arthur, Gwenhwyfar, Morgause, etc. from the womens' perspective, and rightly so.  It is so human, so real, so addicting, that you want this tale never to end, and feel a sort of disparing loss when you are done, yet a spectacular feeling that one cannot ever describe or know until one reads this book. By all means imaginable, read this book. I can GUARANTEE you, you will not regret it.
0385503954|5.0|The writer Chaim Potok once said that you should give a novel written by a respected writer 100 pages before stopping. After a laborious slow start-- I was tempted to abandon reading this book-- this dark novel suddenly became everything I have come to expect from McEwan-- I was so glad I heeded Mr. Potok's advice as I was gloriously rewarded for my efforts. ATONEMENT is the best and most ambitious of Mr. McEwan's novels, even better than his Booker Prize winner AMSTERDAM. The action covers a long period of time: from 1935 to 1999; the characters in this dark novel are unforgettable: Cecilia, Robbie, Briony. Although I finished this book weeks ago, I cannot get Briony out of my mind. Is she just a silly, selfish 13 year old girl when we meet her or the essence of evil? She commits an ugly, vicious deed that changes irrevocably the lives of both Robbie and her older sister Cecilia. While Briony as an adult may carry as many bedpans as she wants to and bind up the wounds of every British soldier who is sent to her hospital, she cannot undo the awful thing she has done or atone, try as she may, for her evil deed. ATONEMENT stands for a difficult truth: we are responsible for our actions. We sometimes cannot make amends for the harm that we do to these people closest to us.<br />Mr. McEwan deserves all the critical acclaim he has received for this fine but troubling novel. It's too bad he couldn't have shared the Booker Prize with Peter Carey for this book. Is anyone who has read her surprised that Ann Beattie loved this novel? I bet Joyce Carol Oates-- speaking of a writer who does not find the truth on angels' wings-- would be crazy about this book too.<br />This novel had the same profound impact on me as other novels I consider world class: SOPHIE'S CHOICE, BLINDNESS, DISGRACE, THE SOUND AND FURY, to name a few.

0790729652|4.0|Back in 1989 when Batman came out I thought this movie was really good, but now after having seen Spider-Man I can understand a lot of people have looked back on this movie and have expressed more dissatisfaction about Batman because it was a more darker and hostile movie.  Indeed, this version of Batman is not like the campy 1960s TV show and the origins story told here is based on The Joker (The Joker killed Batman's parents?  Where did that come from?).  In fact The Joker gets more screen time than the Caped Crusader.  I liked Jack Nicohlson's performance but his rendition of The Joker was very mean-spirited.<br />The visuals were stunning, but this is what you would expect from a Tim Burton film.  Theres no story behind it.  I would've given Batman one star, but Burton is one of my favorite directors so I have to give this movie a good rating even though it has now been unfairly maligned by the public (the movie was the highest grossing film in 1989, but only because of marketing and mass publicity).  Still, Batman is a good movie to look back to if you want to see a comic book superhero come to life even though the movie did not do a very good job at it.
B000003S0D|3.0|Regardless of which version of KC you like, Lizard demonstrates that Fripp was/is the leader of the band. The sweeping sound, baroque touches, jazz influences (particularly of Miles Davis and John Coltrane), symphonic rock (before it became evil) are all elements that Fripp has used before quite effectively. They also are trademarks of KC's sound at least through Lizard.<br />With Lizard KC began to shed it's skin. Islands was the work of a band wandering in search of new directions. Lizard is the transitional album between Court and Wake and Islands. The new KC sound wasn't long for this world as Fripp immediately dropped it in favor of the harsher (but equally valid)racket created by Fripp, Wetton, Bruford, Cross and Muir on Lark's.<br />With Lizard Fripp began to find his voice as a songwriter. There's moments on Wake that are sublime and powerful but it's clear that Fripp was trying to achieve continuity; he was trying maintain the \\"classic\\" KC sound while forging an identity of his own. Lizard demonstrates Fripp's distinct arrival as a songwriter. Fripp would reach his peak with the FWB axis on the next three Crimso albums.<br />Lizard consists of most of the running time of this album. I'm not sure if the Fripp-Sinfield piece was composed in reaction to Ian McDonald's (and Sinfield's) Suite from McDonald-Giles. It's possible as both were released at roughly the same time (although McDonald's piece had origins as far back as the first KC album).<br />Regardless, Lizard stands alone, adrift from the rest of the KC catalog; this line up of KC never toured (Mel Collins was the only hold over besides Fripp and Sinfield for the next album). The public really never got to hear this material live so it exists as a imperfect but powerful miniature forever on display.
B00004KD1L|5.0|From the get go of all Groove Armada albums, you know what you have to work with. A wonderful mix of lazy grooves, and beats that make your soul feel better. A soundtrack for life, listen and suddenly you will catch yourself humming the tunes everywhere. The best bet for any downtempo or after party. ABSOLUTELY theraputic to listen to by a fire with a glass of wine.Flawlessly mixed, organized, and all around the best album you will ever buy. Even if you hate electronic music you will love this!
0380817683|5.0|This book is just amazing! Marian Keyes writing style is a breeze to read and her characters are very real! The story is funny and moving at the same time. A lot of fun to read. I totally recommend it! If you liked Brigitte Jones, then you must read this book.
B00005JKCF|4.0|I finally saw the movie and what can I say it was awesome especially when he swings through the buildings the grapics are also bad ... . The only flaw was that the green goblin didn't really look like a green goblin he looked more like a transformer character but I liked it and I will go see it again. I recomend for comic viewers!
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I had been expecting great music and fascinating graphics and acting but to be honest I was dissappointed. <BR>I didn't like most of the songs in the movie, the techno BG was just a headache to me. The CGs are not being used effectively at all, one might as well use hand drawings and they would look better. The story was dull and repeating. Sometimes it just looked ridiculous to me. The movie needs more &quot;faces&quot; than nicole and the hotshot. By the end I was tired of only seeing those 2 faces because most other actors were wearing masks or in heavy makeup and you can't enjoy their expressions.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Can't believe I waited so long to listen to the whole album (also done at said local listening station: I was completely entranced). Yes, the willful dissonance can be disconcerting at first -- this even to an erstwhile fan of electronic &quot;noise&quot; bands from the '70s and '80s -- but in the end this music is beautiful, haunting, redemptive stuff.  Hats off to Wilco for refusing to compromise and to Nonesuch for making this brilliant album available.

B00005YXZH|5.0|Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is great. Radio Cure takes some getting used to, but you'll soon see the brilliance. My favorite songs are Kamera, Ashes.., Heavy Metal Drummer and I'm The Man Who Loves You, but they're all great. Looking forward to the documentary this summer.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|Before typing this, I'd just like to make one thing clear: I generally like action movies. I generally like Angelina Jolie. I even think the Lara Croft games are fantastic. But, nonetheless, this has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. <br />The movie starts off well with the introduction of Lara, but once she goes off on her adventure, it becomes a completely incoherent babblefest. It's pure stupidity at it's worst and I'd avoid it like the plague. However, because there is an interestingly campy quality about the acting that allows you to relish in the sheer complexity of its badness, I will give it another half-star. <br />Oh wait, you can't give half-stars here. I guess I'll just have to leave it at one.
0380789019|2.0|Neverwhere is a pretty basic piece of today's standard fiction.  I actually expected something a bit better from the author of the great Sandman comic series, but maybe he's just not good a novels.<br />The story is about another world that lies below London (aptly titled \\"London Below\\").  The world is filled with your basic strange creatures and intelligent rats.  Nothing really to see here and really nothing at all thats new.  The characters try to be interesting but they fall short since the general plot and subsequently the characters also have been done so many times.  The whole \\"outsider unwittingly saves the day\\" thing has been done [over and over] by authors alot better than this one.<br />I gave it two stars (instead of one) because if you're just starting to read fiction for first time in your life and you pick up this book, you will probably enjoy it.  Unfortuantly 90's authors especially Science Fiction and Fantasy writers are usually just rehashing stuff already done better by the old time greats.<br />So, the verdict is, get this if you've got no culture and a plane ride ... past that don't expect much.<br />If nothing else I suggest you start with pre 70's fantasy and sf...
B000060MY6|2.0|The most confusing movie I have seen in my life. I did not get the point of this movie at all. When you rate a movie on here you must give a star amount, I only gave it a 2 because I did not understand it at all. If you like strange movies watch this.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Great movie!  Saw it twice.  Been waiting since I was in my teens for a movie to be made of the comic book Spider-man.  Sam Raimi did a great job.  Go see it.
B00005JKNF|4.0|Finally a classic mystery movie that I can sit down and watch. Not that much violence as in the Friday the Thirteenth series, thank God! It was a not so reconized movie that had a lot to offer. Though alittle confusing at times it was stil very good. In my opinion both Helen Mirrim or Maggie Smith deserved an Oscar for this movie. They did there roles with style, bliss, and above all, made it look real.
B00005JKED|3.0|I LIKED THE MOVIE. THOUGHT THAT DENZEL REALLY DID DESERVE AN OSCAR FOR THIS ROLE. HE PLAYED A RUTHLESS , AND VIOLENT COP THAT WAS ON THE DRUG FORCE,NO DOUBT THAT HE  WAS BROUGHT DOWN NOT ONLY FROM BEING SUBJECTED TO THE STREETS FOR MANY YEARS , BUT ALSO A BIG CASE OF GREED.  THE THINGS HE DID TO HIS NEW PARTNER REALLY UPSET ME,, AND I KEPT HOPING THROUOUT THE MOVIE THAT BENEATH IT ALL HE DID HAVE A HEART.WELL, THAT NEVER DID HAPPEN, AND IN THE END HE GOT WHAT  HE DESERVED. BUT WHAT A MOVIE. MOVIE SEEMED PRETTY REALISTIC TO ME, LOT OF VIOLENCE.
B00005R2BG|4.0|First off I hate Musicals, anything that has music in it I hate it. This movie however I liked a lot. I do not know what it was about this movie but it was good. I thought that it was one hell of a performance. I have seen the Moulin Rouge show in Paris and thought it was fantastic, and at first I did not want to see the movie because I thought it would ruin the show, but it only bettered it. Should have won the Oscar for Best Picture Recommended to anyone who loves to have fun while watching a movie.
B00004W52U|5.0|This CD is incredible and Op Ivy is the best band in the world it will definetly please and punk fan.  Oh yeah and to Amazon.com no one will ever buy DMX and Op Ivy together it just doesn't happen.
0792846338|4.0|The most realistic horror movie I have every seen. Excellent Acting, Superb Directing, Good everything. Bates deserved the Oscar for this film. I read the book and in this rare case the movie was better then the book. Stephen King is a genus for thinking this story up. my fourth favorite movie of all times. Highly recommended.
B000002LSV|5.0|This Texas trio, comprised of Billy Gibbons, Dusty Hill, and Frank Beard KNOW HOW TO ROCK! This is an absolutely fabulous hits collection. It really should've been a 2 disc set, because these guys have had so many great songs that it is impossible to cram them all into one disc. The 80's rolled around, and ZZ experimented with the new technology, fusing keyboards and synthesizers with their legendary blues rock, and it was a formula that absolutely worked. If you liked the 80's version of ZZ, then you'll love this CD! I love all of their music, 70's, 80's, 90's and beyond. My fav's are the cuts from the Eliminator and Afterburner albums. Absolute fav tracks are 'Sharp Dressed Man', 'Gimme All Your Lovin', 'My Heads In Mississippi, 'Rough Boy' and the 70's hit 'La Grange'. Some of my other favs are missing, songs like 'Velcro Fly', 'TV Dinners', 'Stages' and the original version of 'Legs'. The version of 'Legs' in this collection is the re-mixed version(but is still a great song). This is still a 5-star collection that is worthy to be at the top of your music collection. Another great CD to get is their greatest hits package from the 70's \\"The Best Of ZZ Top\\". These guys are just plain cool, and they know how to rock! If you don't have it, my advice to you is get it ASAP! ROCK ON!!
B00005JKCF|5.0|This flim was well thought out but poorly executed. If I had to think up you word to describe it I would say \\"oatmeal\\". The begining reminds me too much of Dawdson's Creek and Peter's Aunt and Uncle while very well acted were just too Ma and Pa Kettel-ish good feely all American(not that this is a bad thing. Also parents please before you take your 6 and 5 year old kids please remember that this is a PG-13 it does get violent towards the end.  Great action sceans and there is lots of promise for a sequal.
B000065U1N|5.0|I don't think that the word \\"Enchanting\\" actually qualifies for this movie.  The story is every well crafted(the fictionalized stuff not the actual true events).  There are even some elements of humor in the movie.  It does a very good job of depiciting the massive mob-rush tactics of the Somalies.  The only aspect of the flim that is lacking I think is that you never actually feel close to the guys doing the dying, many war films suffer from the same afliction.  I don't think that this movie deserved 2 oscars but it was excellent never the less.
1558216340|5.0|I have read this book twice and the story of what Slavomir Rawicz and his companions was able to accomplish still astounds me. The lengths they went to find freedom are a lesson that applies in any age. Its a remarkable story of their journey I enjoyed it as much now as I did 30 years ago.
B00005YTFG|1.0|What a mind-bending piece of eye candy!  Aside from the fact that our heroine dies very gracefully, despite the fact she has tuberculosis- a particularly nasty disease indeed, the modern soundtrack had the annoying habit of yanking the audience out of the story back into the present.  With that in mind, it was extremely difficult to &quot;suspend disbelief.&quot;  I wanted to like it, but it was just a garbage movie.
B00005JKCF|2.0|My sweety and I were so disappointed in this flop of a flick.  He's a real Spidey fanatic and I had to wake him up at several points throughout the film.  The only reason I managed to stay conscious was because I knew nothing about the origin of Spider-man and was driven on by curiosity.  But we both found the film totally predictable and cheezy.  The romance aspect of the movie was played out much to much and even the promise of exciting special effects did not follow through.  The only good thing about this movie was the ever erasable Toby McGuire, who was perfect as Peter Parker.  I am a big Kirsten Dunst fan, and I must say that her acting in this movie was nausiating.  To lay it on the line, save yourself the money and rent it next year.
B000003B6J|5.0|weather you like them or not you have to give credit where credit is due.this group along with public enemy was what america feared.i always thought public enemy and NWA was brothers from another mother.same anger same rage they just handled it differently.i don't think nwa destroyed rap at all,the fcc and radio actually destroyed it.NWA didn't make the problems,the problems made them.most of this is reactionary anger not offensive anger.you just have a bunch of [mad] young black males.i remember what queen latifah said,she said if it wasn't for nwa she wouldn't know about what was going on in compton.thats true NWA didn't suger coat anything wich is what i liked about them.i'm pretty sure NWA's views has slightly changed now.but thats how they felt back in the day.they was gangstas long before it became trendy.
B000060P79|5.0|Wow, that's pretty much all I can really say.. great cd.  I would really recomment it for anyone, even if you think you might not be into the type of music.. trust me you will wanna just keep listening to it over and over.. :P
B00005T30L|5.0|This movie is incredible.  It's as simple as that.  And EVERYONE should see it - it's got awesome acting, extremely deep characters, a perfect cast, it's wicked funny, plus it has strong undertones about relationships and American culture.  Every time I watch this movie I pick up on something new that it's trying to tell you.  Two words: SEE IT.
0962477060|5.0|The book lays out a framework for understanding why the guitar is tuned the way it is, how chords can be found anywhere along the fretboard, and how to identify scales anywhere along the fretboard. It is appropriate for somebody with some experience with the instrument (barre chords are a must). If you are a rank beginner, this is not a good starting point. But, if you want to move beyond first position chords, if you want to understand the fretboard, and if you want to understand scales and why they are important, then this book is great. I use it as a stepping stone to more advanced tunes which require a deeper understanding of the fretboard. Think of this book as \\"Guitar Theory 101\\".
B000053VAZ|4.0|I love this movie.  Heck, I own it on DVD.  The best thing about it is Johnny Depp, hands down.  He is not only incredibly good looking (as usual) in it, but he is incredibly cute and funny as well!  This movie just lifts your spirits.  The only thing I didn't like as much was Aidan Quinn's character because I found him annoying and asympathetic, but overall this is a great movie.
0446678430|2.0|This book is a bit too abstract. I would have liked it if he had described a bit more the sweat and heat of running a business. And he says he retired at age 48. To me, retiring young is more along the lines of what Eddie Murphy said, &quot;I always knew I'd be a millionaire by age 21.&quot; That's young! And if Kiyosaki didn't retire until age 48 (and he retired on a fairly unimpressive five-figure passive income) EVEN THOUGH HE HAD BEEN COACHED BY HIS RICH DAD SINCE AGE 9, a reader older than 9 can tend to feel it's too late to start the multi-years process of getting rich, which for Kiyosaki involved being homeless in his late 30's. And I confess, I'm older than 9 myself!
0380789035|5.0|One way to describe this novel would be to list the ingredients that went in the recipe.  Here they are: 1) Throw in a good chunk of Joseph Campbell, 2) Stir in a good measure of Ann Rice, 3) Spice up and mix the whole lot with some Jack Kerouac, and 4)Add Neil Gaiman's special sauce and let it marinate.  Cook it and serve steaming hot.
B0000668IF|2.0|Overall the album is listenable however, nothing sticks out, nothing's innovative, nothing is \\"new\\" sounding.  Most of the tracks sound like they're composed of recycled samples from his previous albums.  Most tracks are \\"downtempo\\" and could make a good CD to play for background music, but that's about it - nothing memorable.

6304711875|1.0|Of all the pop culture flicks in the past ten years, this is one of the worst!  Then Wes Craven goes and makes a trilogy out of it.  MORON! The hardcore fans of Scream will claim its a clever satire, when in fact the comedy feel to the movie derives not from satiristic intent, but rather from its trying to be a hip teen flick.  Its characters apply to every stereotypical teenager.  There is a tough guy (Ulrich), a movie nerd (Kennedy), a hot innocent girl (Campbell) , a hot slut type (Mcgowan), a funny cool guy (Lillard), and theres even one of normal guys whos trying to get with a hot girl whose out of his league (Arquette and Cox).  The script is as sterotypical as the characters.  The average 14 year old girl will tell me that they never knew what was going to happen in this \\"clever\\" script, when it is in fact as expected as its two ridiculous sequels.  The killers are magical Wizards.  Even if its impossible for them to pop out, they do- just like their sequels.  I could call this movie a failure, but its not.  Craven accomplishes exactly what he is trying to- ridiculous pop horror flick that will get him a bigger office and a higher budget for his next films.  The fact that this shamless garbage provoked several others of its kind (I Still Know What You Did, Scary Movie, Final Destination, Urban Legends...the list goes on)makes it even worse!!
0385503954|2.0|Rather than artfullly tell what would be an interesting story, McEwan jerks the reader around. The crux of the novel--a young man's life is ruined by a dreamy 12 year-old's false accusation--is compelling. But the way McEwan spins the story out is at times tedious (full of uninteresting description falsely attributed to the point of view of characters who would be inured to their surroundings and never notice such things) and at other times a tease--he stops chapters and sections just short of what you most want to know to create false suspense. The last section is ridiculous and undermines any interest created in the bulk of the novel preceding it. Atonement is sheer hackery, all the worse for the skillful writing sometimes placed in its service.<br />If you want to read an interesting and honest novel along the same lines, try Alice Elliott Dark's Think of England, which employs a similar three-part structure to tell the story of a woman coming to terms with a tragic childhood event.<br />I do understand the appeal of Atonement--it makes the reader feel smart by telegraphing its ideas and enlisting you in its shabby fakery. Word-of-mouth and reviews have fed the frenzy. But don't be fooled into thinking this is anything near a great book.
B000003N7G|5.0|... Anyways, moving on.<br />Not your normal coltrane, but then again...what IS \\"normal coltrane\\"? Most of his work is filled with mid-boggling solo's accompanied by only the best musicians times had to offer. This is something that will bring tears to your eyes......when you begin to understand and appreciate it that is. I still remember hearing it the first time, I thought it was overrated, but then, like all good jazz, this grows on you. And boy does it get big! (bad joke)...I have giant steps, blue train, and now this. Just the begining of my coltrane collection. But this is most definatly a great way to start.
B000065V3H|5.0|Don't forget, of all the the actors/actresses in this movie the most famous one (currently) is Seth Green.  He plays Ronald's little brother in Can't Buy Me Love.  Did I also mention he has clearly has the best lines in the movie.
B000002KYR|4.0|This album is VERY underrated.It is one of the greatest album of all time.Billy G is allmost on fire!
B000060P79|5.0|...I'm just here to say great stuff about this CD...... The tune, lyrics, melody, all ...is great!!! Buy this album now! Trust me, you won't regret it!! (Recommended for people over 12, and people who like Rock/Metal!)
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie is called the \\"Japanese Star Wars\\" by many, and it's easy to see why. Gorgeous visuals, a moving story, and mythic underpinnings will remind Western audiences of Lucas's masterwork.  However, in some ways this is a deeper and more complex work.  Unlike the clear cut good / evil dichotomy of \\"Star Wars,\\"  all the characters in this story have an element of goodness, even those like the lady of Iron Town that we initially may not want to like, but who rehabilitates prostitutes and cares for lepers.  And the easy answers of the prince hero are shown to be shallow to a certain extent.  However, although the viewer is left to make his or her own evaluations, there are clear messages: the forest and the forest spirit are sacred, and in the end not understandable by humans.  Those consumed by hate, for whatever reason, are in the end demonic and to be shunned as well as pitied.<br />A beautiful, thrilling blend of animation and storytelling.  A small warning:  just because this is animated, don't make the mistake of thinking it is a \\"kiddie\\" film.  This movie has powerful messages about very adult issues, and there are moments of explicit violence.  A movie to watch and talk to about with kids, not to use as a mindless babysitter.<br />Overall, the images and questions will remain with you long after the film ends.  Highly recommended.
B000060P79|5.0|This CD [freaking] rocks!! Simple Plan is Canadian, and If this is the music that represents Canada, well hell, I'm glad 2 be Canadian!!! \\"I'm just a kid\\" is the best song! You can relate to it so easily!...
6305508550|5.0|Don't think twice about buying this DVD. This one of the funniest movies ever made. Don't think-BUY
B0000668IF|5.0|What a great album! Simply put, \\"18\\" is basically like all the good points of \\"Play\\" expanded upon and released in one coherent album. I loved so much of \\"Play\\" but also found much of it to be filler, and simply not up the level of the rest of the album. This one, while a bit more downbeat overall (don't expect this album to be spinning at the dance clubs much!) is an awesome listening experience from beginning to end, and, like the new Sneaker Pimps album \\"Bloodsport\\", is one of the year's most refreshing and entertaining CDs!
B000065U1N|5.0|Gritty, convincing, and gory.  Those are some of the words that describe Black Hawk Down.  The performances are flawless, especially Australian actor Eric Bana, who give an excellent performance in Chopper.  The supporting cast, including Josh Hartnett, Ewan Mcgregor, Sam Shepard and Jason Isaacs are very convincing in their respective roles.  In my opinion the best movie of 2001!!
0440219078|5.0|My college Comp. II teacher describes this book as \\"no longer just for children.\\"  It is now making it's way on to campuses across the US.  It's \\"young adult\\" reading level doesn't compromise it's message.  You should give it a try, no matter what age you are.<br />I read The Giver in Elementary School, and remember liking it very much.  I didn't understand it at the level I do now, but I did get the main concept.  Contrary to popular belief, it will not ruin your child.  Parents shielding their children from excellent literature like this only worsens the current lack of maturity I see coming out of elementary school students.  Do you think it is a coincidence that the children or our society are taking on all responsibilities 5 years later than the average person of a century ago?  Some parents' groups are trying to ban The Giver from their local school districts.  It should be required reading.  Books don't hurt anybody.  Censorship, however, does deprive them of character building material, to which they should have the right to read.
B000003CKH|5.0|The music is just great. Its good for all occasions. It can be almost soft or can be whatever else you want it to be. THIS is a GREAT CD. Motorcade of generosity is their best cd of all time though.
B00000G6TL|5.0|I got so much enjoyment out of this band when I was a teenager and now (twenty five years later) playing the digital remaster is like hearing Deep Purple for the first time! You can enjoy Ian Paice's brilliant drum-playing like never before (!), Jon Lord's distinctive organ sound is crystal clear, and I can for the first make out what Ritchie Blackmore's wibbly guitar is actually doing! Ironic, isn't it, that advanced technology may prove to be the main cause behind the revival of bands like Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, etc? Not a bad thing. Listen to Highway Star. It positively cooks, while Demon's Eye, Smoke on the Water and Never Before sound as fresh as ever (which is more than can be said of most of Led Zeppelin's output). Some of these songs sound like they were recorded yesterday. Points off for the inclusion last few tracks which in my view don't quite cut  it. The rest is Rock n Roll Rolls Royce.<br />Take my word for it. Deep Purple were, in their heyday, absolutely brilliant. This is the proof.
B0000668IF|4.0|...not that that is necessarily a bad thing!<BR>Moby's return to the music world makes it clear that he has spent a lot of time since the release of \\"Play\\" listening to his David Bowie collection. For the opening track, \\"We Are All Made Of Stars\\", a gorgeous, slow intro to a very soulful recording, it's clear that Bowie's \\"Thin White Duke\\" phase has been gone over with a fine tooth comb.<BR>This is a much warmer recording than \\"Play\\", which is a surprising, but welcome, direction for an artist who has been the most successful at bringing the \\"electronica\\" movement to a wide American audience. Moby clearly has an affection for American R&B music, and makes very good use of bass and strings on a number of tracks.<BR>Without a doubt, the best track on this CD is \\"Jam For The Ladies\\", where Moby wisely turns over the mike to Angie Stone for some soul stirring vocals, and MC LYTE (back from the missing) to throw up a wonderful rap. This is the only song on the disc that approaches the dance power of \\"Body Rock\\", and if the radio gods are at all friendly, you'll be hearing this jam with some serious bass boost all summer long.<BR>Among the other highlights of 18 are \\"Harbour\\", featuring Sinead O'Conner (though I had to look at the credits to determine it was her - her vocals don't sound anything like her past work), \\"One Of These Mornings\\", which has the same gospel feel as \\"Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad\\", and \\"Signs Of Love\\", another direct Bowie steal which conveys a sense of detached coldness over an incredibly warm rhythm section.<BR>This album is quite an artistic departure from \\"Play\\", which is an interesting move for Moby. He seems to be crying out for artistic respect over commercial success. Of course, since he sold 20 million copies of Play, as well as reaped incredible licensing fees off the tracks, he can afford to sit back and create. <BR>Many of these songs sound like they will be difficult to capture live, which makes Area 2 (the summer tour with, surprise,David Bowie as the guest star) highly anticipated. Moby's live shows are usually very solid, and he's got a challenging group of frewsh songs to present live.
6305078491|5.0|Watching Carl Dreyer's  *Vampyr*  reminds me of having a fever:  the surreal becomes real; the mind wanders; delirium seems incipient.  Both experiences make you feel wretched.  But as far as the movie goes, that's OK:  art reserves the right to be full of misery, occasionally.  In a brave new world, all art would be happy-happy . . . rather fortunately, we live in the real world, in which movies like  *Vampyr*  are necessary.  It's not so much a vampire story as it is a meditation on death.  Befitting the subject, the movie looks like an intangible nightmare:  photographer Rudolph Mate shoots the thing through a gauze-like fog -- initially an accident, but Dreyer, who knew striking visuals when he saw them, insisted that Mate photograph the entire movie that way.  Dreyer's vampire is an ugly old broad who scuttles through corridors and the stricken landscapes like an arthritic crab.  Her antagonist, the amusingly named  \\"Allan Gray\\", tends to sip tea and read books or catch a nap on a park bench while the villagers die around him.  At least he's always impeccably dressed, I suppose.  (Julian West -- not his real name -- not only played this part but apparently funded the whole project.)  The least distinction of  *Vampyr*  is that it was the best vampire movie of its time, even better than Murnau's silent curio  *Nosferatu*, and certainly better than Tod Browning's contemporaneous laugh-fest  *Dracula*  featuring that goofy Lugosi fellow.  Its preoccupation with death and dying, and its gradual massing of death-imagery, wouldn't be equaled until Ingmar Bergman trod similar thematic ground some decades later.  [As for the DVD, let us simply say that  \\"Image Entertainment\\"  strikes again:  yes yes, the photography is milky, but the print is still unrestored.  The picture quality is supposed to look surreal, not awful. And the erratically-used, gigantic subtitles in gothic script before black backgrounds that cover half the screen is such a bad idea that it defies critique.  I'm so sick of this company.  But since they're among the few companies who have cinematic masterpieces like  *Vampyr*  in their catalog, we will have to continue to put up with these jerks.]
B000002UB3|5.0|This album documents the final days of the most talented and influential band in history. It is amazing just how brilliant and coherent it is when you consider just how bad relations had become between the members. For this reason, most of the songs on the first side are solo efforts by messrs Lennon, McCartney, Starr and Harrison - surprisingly the latter proving the most effective. With the sublime 'Something' and the beautiful 'Here Comes The Sun' George at last had his day in the sun, upstaging his colleagues at the final hurdle. It seems fitting that as the Beatles were dissolving, George's songwriting talents were blossoming thus paving the way for his highly successful solo career. This is not to say that the others didn't come up with the goods. Lennon in particular was growing more mature as a songwriter - 'Come Together' is really groovy with an unforgettble bassline, and his ode to Yoko 'I want you (She's So Heavy)' is an absolute epic showing that the economy of words is sometimes just as effective as Dylan esque poetry. McCartney too was continuing with his story in song technique and the vastly underrated 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer' which proves to be a more than satisfying cap to this often ridiculed style. The 50's like 'Oh Darling' is also a lovely little ditty, showing his vocal versatility to it's maximum. And just before the barn doors closed even Ringo chipped in with the jaunty sing-along 'Octopuses Garden' which I believe to be also underrated and superior to the similar 'Yellow Submarine'. The first side of the record, made up of 'proper songs' concludes with 'You Never Give Me Your Money', a wonderful and beautiful McCartney penned tale of the Beatles story, right from leaving home as a teenager to the crumbling of the Apple empire - it's reminicent of 'A Day In The Life' and just as mindblowing.<br />The second side of this record is very, very different from the first half in that it contains half-finished songs strewn together to form a rock opera. Truly original and devastatingly effective. It would be interesting to know just what influence this had on Queen in the making of 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. Each song segues flawlessly into the next anjd the genius of the Beatles and producer George Martin has never been more apparent. Add to this a Ringo drum solo, his first and last, individual guitar solos by the others, a brilliant Shakespeare esque pay off line of 'And in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make' and a cheeky little acoustic number by McCartney (Her Majesty) and you have a truly fantastic record - a fantastic farewell by the Beatles. Genius.
B000001E18|3.0|This album is a bit of an acquired taste.  It also helps if you're a big U2 fan.  There is a lot of experimentation on this album, and the result is like a less catchy Achtung Baby.  I like this album the more I listen to it, especially Zooropa, Lemon, Numb, and Johnny Cash's song, the Wanderer (this is an Awesome song, if you don't listen to it as a U2 song at first).  This is a good album, but U2 definitely has better (try Boy, Achtung Baby, All That You Can't Leave Behind, first).<BR>Worth buying.
B000063S6Z|5.0|a beautiful album-- pretty, melancholy and serene.  my personal highlights include \\"great escape,\\" \\"one of these mornings,\\" \\"sleep alone,\\" and \\"harbor,\\" which features one of the best singers in the world--sinead o'connor.  be sure to listen to the album straight through at least a couple of times--take a walk and listen to it on headphones; you won't be sorry.
B000000P17|5.0|OK i'm not as big of a GNR fan as I was when I was a kid , but every once in awhile I still pop in the Illusions albums and Appetite ..and especially this one. Why?. Because now I am a huge punk fan , and at the time I had this I didn't even know who any of these bands were and didn't even care for the songs all that much then except for the cover of FEAR's \\"I Don't Care About You\\" and UK Sub's \\"Down On The Farm\\". Now after repurchasing this and now I see the great bands and songs that were covered here such as the awesome version of the Misfit's classic \\"Attitude\\" and The Dead Boys \\"Aint It Fun\\" are well done. The cover of The Damned's \\"New Rose\\" is decent but Duff's voice is kinda [bad], and now after comparing the UK Sub's version of \\"Down On The Farm\\" to GNR's..GNR's is definitly better because it has a rawer rock sound to it. Iggy Pop's \\"Raw Power\\" is also a stand out. I say punk fans would probably enjoy this more than most GNR fans or not because well I know alot of punks arent too thrilled with GNR covering these songs in the first place , but since I had it when I was around 10 or 11 I don't really seem to care
B0000584V3|5.0|This CD is something else. This band is something esle. Upon hearing about how good this CD is, I decided to buy it, and I'm glad I did. All the tracks on here, from The Leper Affinity to the Title Track, are all spectacular and well-crafted. The more I hear it, the more I love it. That's a sign of a truly great album. I know I'll be playing this CD for a long time to come!
B00003CX5P|2.0|Well, what a disappointment... Of course the movie, technically speaking, is marvellous. But there's no substance. Lucas transformed the \\"series\\" into a show for all the family, totally inofensive, almost \\"Disney-like\\".<br />The boy-actor that plays Anakin was a bad, real bad choice. The poor boy simply can't act.<br />Jar-Jar binks was a bad comic relief.<br />And now we learn that Lucas even intended to put NSYNC in the sequence  (ATTACK OF THE CLONES), due to a request from his daughter!!!!<br />The series is now nothing more than just a merchandising enterprise, and Lucas really lost his touch for direction. I hope the new sequence is better than this one.
B00005QFHG|5.0|this movie is simply beautiful and very clever...you wish you were born in Switzerland...with that chocolate
B0000668IF|4.0|Today I nabbed a copy of Moby's 18 to review.  At first, I was a bit disappointed.  The first, and probably best track, \\"We Are All Made of Stars,\\" features the thin, reedy vocals of Moby.  So do \\"Signs of Love,\\" \\"Extreme Ways,\\" and \\"Sleep Alone.\\"  But somehow, despite his less-than-powerful voice, he's endearing, and the music has a certain frail and wavering charm.  Maybe that's why \\"We Are All Made of Stars\\" was chosen as the first single.<br />Mostly, the lyrics are sung/sampled by an eclectic group of vocalists including The Shining Light Gospel Choir, Sinead O'Connor, Jennifer Price, Shauna and Lorraine Phillips, Sylvia Robinson, Freedom Bremner, and Azure Ray.  I'm not personally fond of jazzy or gospelicious singing, but the combination works well.  The music is mostly down-tempo, with the exception of \\"Jam For the Ladies\\" featuring the singing/rapping of Angie Stone and MC Lyte.  It's not exactly stompy, but will get the masses shaking their butts on the dance floor.<br />What I prefer, over the varied vocals, is the music itself.  Warm, sweeping synths conjure up bittersweet melancholy, a merrygosorrow of sound.  It's reminiscent of Porcelain, only with a bit more of a gospel sound.  I guess that's similar to the \\"Play\\" album.  I've already seen snide reviews referring to \\"18\\" as \\"Re-Play\\".  \\"Play\\" was the stuff commercials are made of, and so might \\"18\\".
1878424319|5.0|What I liked most about this simple yet powerful little book is how easily Don Miguel Ruiz's agreements can be incorporated into every day life without much effort.  You do need to be committed and have courage in adapting these agreements, but without judging yourself in how you're doing as good or bad, your life can become easy and fun.  The agreements Ruiz presents, which are handed down from an ancient Mexican society called &quot;The Toltec,&quot; seem very natural and relevant to living a life that is truthful, loving and fulfilling. <br />With an open mind in reading about a new way of seeing how the Toltec saw the world and lived in it, I discovered a personal freedom in my own life.  By incorporating the third agreement of &quot;don't make assumptions,&quot; my communications are clearer, enabling my relationships with others to be satisfying and enriching.  I especially liked the fourth agreement &quot;always <BR>do your best.&quot;  By doing your best, Ruiz explains there are no regrets.<br />Another practical guide to personal freedom that has had a profound effect on my life is called &quot;WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK&quot; written by Ariel and Shya Kane.  In this book the keys for transforming your life from ordinary to extraordinary are presented with humor, compassion and real life experiences. I highly recommend both of these books!
B00005JKCF|5.0|For Spiderfans in know this movie project was something a good 10 to 20 years in the making and I'd dare say, Spider-Man has lived up to its expectations.  Featuring a solid storyline, AWESOME action sequences, CGI and regular special effects this movie, which stayed fairly true to Spider-Man canon with some minor changes, does not disappoint and fully delivers.<br />THE STORY:<br />The movie basically is loosely based on two major Spider-Man storylines:<BR>  <BR>1. The Spider-Man origin story which recounts how Peter Parker, the typical high school nerd receives great powers when he's bitten by an irradiated spider and how, through a horrible personal accident that he could have prevented learns the ultimate lesson of how \\"With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility\\" and <br />2. The Green Goblin Saga which discusses how a crazed billionaire industrialist becomes the homicidal and maniacal Green Goblin, Spider-Man's greatest foe bent on destroying our favorite superhero by any means (including some PERSONAL, close to home attacks) necessary.<br />THE COOL THINGS:<br />1. The action.  First and foremost it is the action that drives this movie.  The first and subsequent fight scenes between Spidey and the Green Goblin are what make this movie a winner.  The action choreography and accurate depiction of both men's fighting styles stay true to the book, including Spider-Man's awesome limber limbs.  The fight scenes between both men (especially the first one) are among the best you will ever see in ANY action movie.<br />2. The effects.  Definitely ranking up their in any Hollywood production are how Spider-Man's web-slinging powers are rendered in this film.  Again, very true to his comic-book depiction you'll marvel at how Spider-Man swings from building to building and how he uses his web powers in battle or to merely \\"hang around.\\"  The DNA effects were cool too.<br />3. The story.  Obviously looking towards future sequels and building a franchise it's a great treatfor long-time Spidey followers at how the plot threads are still kept loose with Harry Osbourne and Spider-Man and the budding relationship of Mary Jane Watson and Peter Parker at the end.  Also included are brief potential looks ahead for future villains with the mention of \\"Dr. Conners.\\"<br />NITPICKING:<br />Looking at some discrepancies between the comics and the movie we have:<BR>1. The Web Shooters:  In the movie Peter generates his own webs internally.  In the comics he builds web shooters to shoot webs.<br />2. The origin story.  The movie features a robber/carjacker.  The comic has a robber/burglar.<br />3. The origin story.  The movie features wrestler Bonesaw McGraw (played by Randy \\"Macho Man\\" Savage.  The comic features wrestler Crusher Hogan (which undoubtedly somehow influenced legendary wrestler Hulk Hogan).<br />4. The Goblin Saga.  The comics featured Spider-Man's first true love Gwen Stacy getting caught up in the super-hero struggle.  The movie revolves around eventual Spider-Man resident female love interest, Mary Jane Watson(-Parker).<br />THE VERDICT:<br />Overall, this is the film that Spider-fans have waited their whole lives for.  The action, effects and story are solid with enough hanging plot threads that will make long-time fans anxiously await the sequel.<br />While some of the changes between comic and movie may have hardcore fans a little uppity, the changes are minor enough to let by and the rest of the movie's great points should put aside any other worries.<br />Overall, Spider-fan or not, this is definitely not a movie you'll want to miss.<br />Highest Recommendation
B00005QG9J|5.0|I love Incubus and their previous albums but Morning View is a really great addition to the others. After buying Make Your Self I fell totally in love with the band and started buying the previous and becoming a big fan. Now that Morning View has come out it really shows that they can be rock but very mellow and very calm, which can really rock and be awsome when you love Incubus!
B000003TAW|4.0|this is the best Weezer CD of all time. the reason i gave it 4 stars is because i think the songs are to long, especially UNDONE, and in songs like SURF WAX AMERICA, it gets really good and then slows down, listen to it and youll see what i mean. anyhoo, my top 5 favs in order are:<BR>(1) BUDDY HOLLY<BR>(2) SAY IT AINT SO<BR>(3) NO ONE ELSE<BR>(4) THE WORLD HAS TURNED AND LEFT ME HERE<BR>(5) MY NAME IS JONAS
0446310786|4.0|Harper Lee's to Kill A Mockinbird is a wonderful book. The characters are well portrayed, and the setting is described in a very intreging way. Harper Lee sets the story in a small town like the one she grew up in and this helps us relate more the characters and what is going on in the story. She also creates a significance in the story from the setting by relating it to something we have all seen or heard of. The novel has a very interesting plot that ingulps you into it the second you start reading the book. The meaning of the book is very significant in itself. Harper Lee uses a lot of metaphors in this story but one can always understand what she means by these metaphorical phrases. With this book Harper Lee has portrayed examples of our historical past. This novel is one of the best of all times and you will not just read it once but rather over and over again.
0345350472|3.0|Androids is as different from the film Blade Runner as most of Ian Fleming's Bond stories are from the films made after them. Deckard comes across as a more henpecked, harried man--married to an emotionally distant woman, seeking the answers to life through a simulation of the last days of a sort of messiah whose end came about similarly to Jesus'. You'll meet most of the same characters, but don't pick up this book expecting to experience the same oily, slinky, gritty feel of the noirish movie. It stands on its own as a good story, if not a little confusing at points as many of Dick's works are. True BR fans with knowledge of earlier drafts of the screenplay will have a better time making the connections between book and film, but those who've seen the movie once or twice only and thought it was \\"okay\\" or \\"pretty cool...\\" may find Androids a bit tedious and discouraging. A must for any die-hard P.K.Dick or Blade Runner fans.
B00000IUT7|2.0|My 4 1/2 year old recieved this red engine last Christmas, and for the first couple of months was used practically every day. (And yes, I agree with the rest of the reviewers- buy rechargable batteries since this engine eats them, and prepare to be disappointed since it cannot pull many cars up the hills without getting stuck.) I will tell you that I cannot BELIEVE my son has not touched this engine since. His complaint is that all it does is go around and around. Instead, he enjoys playing out stories from Thomas, or making up his own train sagas. My husband likes to watch the engine more than my son. I don't know how other children play with their trains, but the battery operated engines just cannot hold his attention for very long. Nevertheless, for the first few months, watching it is really mesmerizing, I could watch it for hours. Perhaps instead of buying this one engine, purchase a setup with more cars and track for the same money. It will probably get more use in the end.
B000065AQU|3.0|OK, on this review I'll talk about the mini-DVD. If you wanna review on the music read my review of the normal-version &quot;Toxicity&quot;, not this or the red covered one.<br />The DVD includes 4 things:The music video for &quot;Toxicity&quot;, which is really cool, but I'm sure you've seen it, and 3 live performances, which are for &quot;Chop Suey!&quot;, &quot;Bounce&quot;, and &quot;Prison Song&quot;. I like the music video and the music, but what takes away from it is that each performance is in the same place, and nothing really special happens in them, so, if you wanna good System of a Down live DVD, get the one that's (I think) is coming out in mid-summer. OK, I'm done now.
B000002H72|5.0|I had just started dating a guy when I was about 22; I put Doolittle into my car's tape player, certain that this guy would be impressed by my exquisite musical taste. Instead, he listened to about two songs before he popped the tape out and said, &quot;I hate your music...it's weird. Can we just listen to the radio?&quot;  Needless to say, that relationship was doomed from the start!  In 1991, I went to see U2 in concert in Boston, primarily because the Pixies were opening for them. The Pixies rocked, but the crowd seemed confused by their presence.  I could read the expressions on the faces of people around me: &quot;Who ARE these people?  Where's U2?  Are these weirdos done yet?&quot; Thank goodness not everyone is privy to the secret pleasures of this incredible band, but I must admit I am amazed that so many people my age (30 years old) have never heard a single Pixies song.  I tend to use the Pixies as a sort of compatibility litmus test for people I meet (who are over the age of discretion and who, frankly, no pun intended, should know better!).  Even if you don't love their music, which is unfathomable to me, you should at least be able to recognize their brilliance. The Pixies are the most unlikely mixture of personalities and sound, but the result is sublime.  This CD will pin you up against the wall and won't let you go until Frank, Kim, Joey and David have had their way with you.
B000021YQV|4.0|If you've read my Toxicity DVD review, you'd know that in this review I'll tell you about the music.<br />...and I will...<br />Songs rated on a scale from 1-5.<BR>1.Prison Song-5/5-This is very political and hard, but can be melodic at times. Very good.<BR>2.Needles-1/5-Boring. Really Boring. Very bad.<BR>3.Deer Dance-1/5-See #2. Very bad.<BR>4.Jet Pilot-1/5-I'm making this CD look bad, aren't I? Very bad.<BR>5.X-1/5-Suprise!Very bad.<BR>6.Chop Suey!-5/5-Finally! OK, I'm positive you've heard this song so I won't review it. Very good.<BR>7.Bounce-3/5-The intro and choruses are cool, but it's too short and the verses are...strange? Is that the word? OK.<BR>8.Forest-5/5-The choruses in this are similar to Chop Suey!'s choruses. Very mystical. Very good.<BR>9.ATWA-1/5-Sorry, SOAD. Very bad.<BR>10.Science-3/5-This has strange lyrics. Scary lyrics. Evil lyrics. OK.<BR>11.Shimmy-1/5-Shimmy co-co puff, give it to me now. Oh yeah. Very bad.<BR>12.Toxicity-5/5-Wortyh of having the CD named after it. A slower song, but it still kicks ...<BR>13.Psycho-2/5-I don't like this song, but I give it 2 because it sends out a message of positivenessnessness. Fair.<BR>14.Aerials-5/5-Awesome song. The longest here. Very good.<br />OK, I recommend SOAD's Toxicity if you like Slipknot, Mudvayne, Disturbed, or Dope.<BR>...!!!
B00003CXB2|2.0|I can not understand all the gushing over this movie.  After seeing Bridge On The River Kwai, I was expecting this to be more in that vain.  Gallant British troops overcoming great odds, led by a brave commander named Lawrence.  What I got was a 4 hour bore fest of how a somewhat unstable man rose to the rank of Colonel.  Give me Gunga Din or Zulu over this any day.  On the plus side, Columbia / TriStar has done a great job on releasing this DVD.  The print is in excellent condition, and the extras are many.  But, like I mentioned, this isn't a movie to have many repeat viewings.
0060934913|4.0|A must-read for foodies who are fans of the \\"gonzo\\" literary style. I fell in love with AB's rollicking style on his Food Network show, and his tales of living on the roller-coaster that is the food-service lifestyle are gripping and wild. Definitely not for those who prefer the genteel serenety of five-bean salad in Martha Stewart celedon!
B000067DNC|5.0|For those of you (me) who missed it the first time around (on the si-fi channel), this series is a must have, it expands on the shoddy movie and takes the genera of science fiction to unprecedented levels of excellence. I just bought season one, and am drooling to have the other 11. :-) Cast your vote now so that those wonderful -cough- we've waited long enough -cough- MGM folks will realize their error and make this happen!
6302054982|4.0|No-one can portray American gangsters quite as vividly and realistically as Scorsese. He shows us the appeal of their glamour; but doesn't flinch at their violence; which is brutal, bloody, very often pointlessness, and always totally amoral. <br />The film follows the rise of a Henry Hill, played by Ray Liotta, through the criminal ranks - loan sharking, hijacking trucks, killing - until he ends up as a close and trusted associate of the `Goodfellas' - a term that gangsters use for themselves: it means someone who can be trusted. It all turns sour when he feels that they have let him down and he turns to drug-smuggling behind the backs of his bosses, an unforgivable crime in their eyes.<br />The film is gripping. Scene after scene holds the eye. Despite the film's length, the pace never relents. Liotta and De Niro are excellent, but it is Joe Pesci who steals the film. Not since James Cagney in `Public Enemy No 1' has a portrayal of a completely amoral thug been so frightening. The sense of violence bubbling under the surface of Pesci is never far away, and when it does erupt, it is quick, horrifying, but predictable. <br />The period of time that Goodfellas covers, 1950s to the 1980s, means that the story tends to lurch from decade to decade, creating an episodic narrative rather than the more continues flow of `Mean Streets'. However, this is a minor criticism. The film is still a classic study of the Italian-American underworld and a great piece of film-making.
B00003CXSP|4.0|The movie better streamlines Thomas Harris' out-of-control Gothic fantasy into at least a semi-palatable film.  The story is not very strong, or very believable  -  Mason Verger, the sole survivor of serial killer Hannibal Lecter's famous reign of terror, is himself a perverse and demented killer, fabulously wealthy, whose obsession is to personally capture Lecter and torture him to death for having crippled and disfigured him years ago  -  but the production and performances make it work.<br />Julianne Moore is excellent as the older and wiser Clarice Starling, amazingly looking and sounding more like a ten-year-older Jodie Foster than Jodie Foster.  Gary Oldman gets to (yet again) chew the scenery as another criminal grotesque  -  completely unrecognizable, beneath the disfiguring makeup  -  the sick and twisted cripple, Mason Verger.  Anthony Hopkins reprises his Oscar-winning role as the suavely psychopathic Hannibal Lecter.<br />The film's  -  and the book's  -  greatest problem is that its story is labored and forced.  The Silence of the Lambs didn't want a sequel, and if it was going to have one, it probably shouldn't have included the character of Clarice Starling.  But the demands of commercialism are far different from those of artistic achievement, and Silence was a phenomenally successful piece both literarily and cinematically, so Hannibal was an unfortunate inevitability.  Thankfully, the movie corrects most of the book's many shortcomings, and is a more satisfying piece of drama.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Wow. After my friend played &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; for me one day, I fell in love with John Mayer.  My friend promised to burn &quot;Room for Squares&quot; for me, but I couldn't wait 24 hours. I ran out to the store.  What a relief.  After hearing way to much whiney pop and repetitive rap music, I was so glad to mellow out.  John Mayer's voice is smooth, strong, and a little smokey.  His lyrics are sincere, and there is quite a bit of variety in his sound; some songs are lighthearted and clever, others a bit more thoughtful and deep.  A great mix overall, and I cannot name a song that I did not LOVE.  Great for singing along to in the car.  I must admit that I havn't listened to any other CD since I bought it...a month ago. <BR>What more can I say...I've run out of words that can describe the genius of this man and the powerfulness of this CD.<BR>GET IT!
6305137293|3.0|This is one of the 1980s most needlessly gratuitous blood-'n-gore flicks. The admirable restraint of John Carpenter's original film is entirely lacking in Rick Rosenthal's sequel. Continuity begins to become a problem in the series starting with this film, by virtue of Michael Meyers' becoming a connoisseur killer for no particular reason.<br />For all these flaws, though, the film is still nail-bitingly suspenseful. The story is clever, providing murderer Michael with a motivation and introducing some interesting backstory. Jamie Lee Curtis continues to play the beleaguered heroine with sympathy, and Donald Pleasance, as always, is fabulous. The effects are good, even if the blood and gore are way, way overdone. The explosive finale is terrific. The color is especially rich. John Carpenter and Alan Howarth's frenetic music score is essentially the same one used in the first movie, but better orchestrated and more full-bodied.<br />Maybe not better the second time around, but still worth a look  -  especially for fans of the series.

B000002ADT|4.0|some may say that this is not an apt analogy, but I think &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; is kind of like the Seinfeld T.V. show (my favorite T.V. comedy).  Although the basic melodies are incredibly simple, what is done with these basic phrases is truly amazing.  I think it's the simplicity of the introductory root melody is what allows the free and melodic improvisation in what follows.  Really tough call as to whether to give this 5 stars, but I'm a very tough grader.
B000002MY3|5.0|In the years following Alanis seeing Madonna on her Blond Ambition tour,the material girl in her most generous and savviest move of her career signed the former Canadian pop queen to a record deal...And the rest as they say has become legend and history.<BR>Having made her first record as a child and even selling it herself on the school bus,Alanis landed a deal in the early 90's with MCA where she made 2 dance oriented albums in her homeland of Canada the smash hit Alanis and the follow up Now is the Time.In the years following the successes of those two albums and in attempt to find her own authentic image and sound,<BR>she collaborated with many other songwriters until finally landing in L.A. with future co writer producer Glen Ballard.<BR>The finished record consisting mostly of demos,was initially expected to sell around 250,000 copies but when a magazine cd compilation with the song You Oughtta Know hit the airwaves,<BR>the music and Alanis' world would change forever.<BR>Selling over 30 million copies and garnering many awards and addolation the record was attacked by her critics back home as being more flash than substance.<BR>From the opening number All I Really Want with it's plaintive and unique call for help and justice,to the final strains of Wake up a call to conciousness this album is a real treat and trip.Mixing tender balladry with balls out rock,it is both a snapshot and portrait of an artist constantly evolving,experiencing,and sharing on this journey called life.<br />Quite possibly aswell the most important record of it's decade.<BR>At least in my humble opinion to say nothing of what it eventually did for songwriters in genreal both male and female.<BR>However don't take my word for it.Swallow this pill down for yourself.
B000021YQV|5.0|This is easily the best CD of 2001.  I listen to this CD 100x more than any other CD I own.  My favorite song is Forest, with Deer Dance, ATWA, X, Science, and Prison Song all tied for second.  Every song on this CD is excellent, not a mediocre one in the bunch!  If you don't have this CD, buy it now!!!!!!!
B00003CXCT|5.0|I thought in highschool as I think today, 10 yrs later, The Star Wars Trilogy is the Best Saga of movies ever made in my lifetime. This first movie is certainly five stars but it is the continuity of how it ties with the others that makes it shine.  The Star Wars TRILOGY is above all other movies(or boxed sets).  I am actually reviewing the three movies here(EXcluding the Phantom Menace which was a joke).  Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamil were excellent in these installments.  The special FX of the original edition were far ahead of thier time and up to par even today, and this Special Edition is even better!(some people won't agree with that)  I hope it is released on DVD soon, it certainly gets my vote 100%<br />(no butterfly ballets PU-LEEEZ!)
B00005221M|5.0|I am writing this in reply to &quot;dmw&quot; from Washington state who called the dvd &quot;poor&quot;.  I am an avid fan of LOTM.  I first saw it when it was released on video (1992 or 1993), I own the video, and have seen the VHS version at least 20 times. I recently bought the new &quot;Director's expanded edition&quot; dvd and was highly impressed by it.First of all, details seem so much clearer than the VHS.  Scenes that seem dark on VHS (like the shooting of the stag at the beginning, the Indian burial ground scene, and the siege at Ft. William Henry) were much lighter and showed more detail.  I could see individual leaves on trees and blades of grass.  The detail in the dvd is incredable.Secondly, the extra scenes put in are not a detraction, but rather additions.  Some of the extra scenes I really liked were: a lot more fighting at the fort, the parley between Montcalm and Monroe is twice as long as in the VHS, this new DVD shows the French actually marching into the fort cheering as they take possession of it, and lastly, the final scene of Chingachook praying ends with an extra exchange between him and Hawkeye about the unstoppable white man who will continue to push the red man west.  &quot;One day there will be no frontier... but once we were here.&quot; It is excellent.Most of these new additions have musical scores, a few do not.  But they did not stick out like sore thumbs.  The entire movie cannot have music behind it.  I did notice the absence of a few lines, particulary where Hawkeye tells Duncan &quot;Someday you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement&quot; and &quot;Have you nothing better to do on the lake today Major?&quot;  But these omissions are trivial when compared to the added detail and extra scenes. Overall, I thought the dvd version flowed very well, and added to the overall experience of the movie.    LOTM has always been one of my favorite movies, now thanks to this expanded edition dvd, I like it even better.  It was worth every penny.
0060975768|4.0|I really enjoyed this book - it is incredible how anyone survived any kind of assault - the only thing I found difficult was trying to keep track of who was who; I found myself going back and forth in the book and looking at the pictures to remember the characters.<br />Hal Moore and Joe Galloway experienced an event that is truly remarkable - it gives me a greater appreciation for what troops went through in Vietnam.
B00005UEAR|3.0|I'd like to start this review off with a request for Dream Theater. <br />For your next studio album... don't bring *any* &quot;inspirational CD's&quot; in with you.<br />Start with a completely empty slate, with no other &quot;influences&quot; to draw from, and try writing something that comes completely from *you*. Being inspired by specific bands or musicians is great and perfectly respectable. But when your music starts sounding as much like those bands' as some of the material on 6DoIT does, I think you start sounding less like an original band and more like a &quot;wanna-be&quot; band. If I want to hear Tool, I'll put on a Tool CD. I don't want to hear Tool when listening to a Dream Theater track.<br />Listening through 6DoIT, I can easily pick out numerous &quot;influences&quot; that are so blatantly obvious, it's almost embarassing. There's Rush, Tool, Peter Gabriel, Pantera, Metallica and I'm sure others that I'm not familiar with all mixed throughout.<br />If not bringing any CD's is just not a viable option, here's an alternative...<BR>Next time around, bring three discs - and only these three - into the studio with you <BR>1. Images And Words<BR>2. Awake<BR>3. A Change of Seasons (specifically title track)<br />If your writing sessions must be &quot;inspired&quot; by other recordings... how about being inspired by your own work, specifically that done with Kevin Moore?<br />Listen again to the melodies and arrangements and emotion that flowed through those earlier works... 'Space Dye Vest', 'Learning To Live' (the best song DT ever recorded, IMO), and 'Under A Glass Moon' come to mind. Mind you, I don't mean *re-do* those albums... but learn from them. Compared to the most recent CD's, it's almost like listening to a different, less musical band at times.<br />You can take your next cue from the title of another of your tracks...<br />Take The Time.<br />Or more to the point.. Take Your Time. I'm sure writing an album as fast as possible in the studio isalot of fun and spontaneous and what-not... but I don't think it's necessarily serving the music for the better. I believe that if you slowed down and let the songs grow and breathe and mature *before* going into the studio, they would take on so much more depth and emotion than what's been coming out of the last few recordings. <br />My review's not *all* doom and gloom, mind you... There *are* moments of brilliance throughout 6DoIT and Metropolis II that prove DT still have it in them to write like that.. but they're so fleeting and sandwiched between fits of playing as fast as they can, simply because they can, that they just don't carry the same impact. The one song on 6DoIT I would say mostly closely demonstrates what I'm talking about is 'Blind Faith' as well as &quot;About to Crash&quot; and the Reprise. <br />Another reviewer recommended this and I agree - next time - hire an outside producer - someone with an objective ear who knows and is experienced in your style of music to give an alternative point-of-view.. someone like Terry Brown, maybe. Remain involved in the production, but have that objective ear available.<br />And lastly... John Myung - PLEASE write more lyrics! John P. and Mike P. - take more time and thought with your offerings! Let them evolve and breathe and mature, too. They seem way too cliche'd and rushed on 6DoIT, with perhaps the exception of 'The Great Debate'. You've proven many times that you can do it.. A Change of Seasons's lyrics, for example, are brilliant, as is every song on IAW... All in all, I think James did a fantastic job lyrically in his contributions.. especially on 'Blind Faith.'<br />And.. that's about it... as for what I think of 6DoIT.. it's a great progressive album.. a bit too overwhelmingly self-indulgent and rushed-sounding, in my opinion, and certainly not representative of DT's best, but a good album nonetheless.<br />And that's my two cents!
0385721234|4.0|Like Water For Chocolate is a wonderful and enchanting novel overflowing with intense passion and desire. It is a beautifully written Mexican story about a girl named Tita who is denied her first true love. It tells of the suffering, struggle, and power of women living in a deeply-rooted heritage full of war and countless traditions. Uniquely written, the novel is a story told in twelve monthly installments interwoven with recipes that enable Tita's freedom and individuality to shine through her deprived childhood. Her talent and love for cooking are easily understood as she demonstrates the power of food on the soul. This novel focuses on Tita's quest for love and happiness, which, in return, bring out the reader's most intimate emotions. It is a fun book persuading the reader that perhaps magic and reality are one in the same. It is a romantic fairy-tale as well as one of the best page-turners I have ever read.
B000002UB3|5.0|Although not their last released album this was their last recording.  At a time when the band was fragmenting this album shows them to be remarkably cohesive.  They sound, possibly, better than ever.  This album features some remarkable performances and with the later tracks of the album all unfinished songs that were &quot;strung&quot; together to make what used to be considered &quot;a side&quot; of an album.  &quot;The End&quot;, an instrumental that shows the group at their peak with alternating solos is the spot of Ringo's only recorded drum solo.  Similar in the peak perfomance catagory is &quot;Because&quot; which shows the groups harmonies (always underrated) at a terrific level.  While the always recognizable &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot; is probably one of George Harrison's most radio played songs my vote for his best composition goes to &quot;Something&quot; which is not only his best but one of the Beatles best.  A classic love song.  <br />All in all, a classic, that will always be enjoyed.  But it and join in the pleasure.
0684803356|5.0|Hemingway's style was so fashionable amongst writers of the post WWII era, that Italian authors actually attempted to invent their own slang just to sound like him. I haven't kept up with modern Italian literature, but I am noting that American writing is slowly regressing into that pre-Hemingway over-wordiness.  The focus now seems to be on sounding &quot;poetic,&quot; rather than writing &quot;one true sentence.&quot;<br />This is truly sad because Hemingway brought American writing to a new level. You can almost feel his straining to come up with the perfect words for his descriptions.<br />I read For Whom the Bell Tolls for the first time thirty years ago, when I was fifteen.  It convinced me then that Ernest Hemingway was the greatest American writer of all time.  Re-reading it now, in middle age, I still feel the same.
B000003BDJ|5.0|I was never a big &quot;Stones&quot; fan, and still really am not.  But this CD shows the group at their peak.  A greatest hits recording full of not only recognizable songs but also outstanding songs.  You will know them, you can sing them, and you will enjoy them.  <br />I can not say enough about this cd - it was truly groundbreaking for a greatest hits project.  How many 1960s rock groups (other than the Beatles) could release a double-album greatest hits project in 1972?  The list would have been short.  This shows that the band many call &quot;The World's Greatest Rock And Roll Band&quot; was thriving and in contention for the title when this album was released. <br />Buy it - you will not be let down.
B000059HCN|5.0|Before I saw this movie, the only movie I've ever cried at was Turner and Hooch, I just my dog and it was very emotional to see a dog die (sorry if I gave up the ending). I never really developed tears it was more of an explosive cry in one of the Electro Shock Treatment, amputaded arm, Jennifer Connelly's happiness for money, and Mr. Waynes' banging his head against a jail bar did a cry break out of me.<br />It wasn't that I even would've gone out of my way to see one of the 3 or 4 best movies that I've seen in recent memory.  I actually am doing a project on school on Drug Addiction, and while reading Naked Lunch, Fear and Loathing, and Drinking, a Love story.  And watching Trainspotting, Traffic and Half Baked have I seen more effective and emotional attachment to drugs. <br />This is an excellent but sad and creepy movie, oh but that uplifting ending!
B000060P79|5.0|After seeing these guys open up for Sugar Ray at my school...I immediately knew that I had to get the cd. The songs that they sang live were awesome and they had the whole crowd rockin. The cd was everything I expected and the songs were just as great. I recommend this to anyone who likes rock/punk. Also check them out on the soundtrack for *The New Guy*
B000002TPS|3.0|First off, I'll say that out of all of Megadeth's non-thrash albums (this album, &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot;, and &quot;Risk&quot;), &quot;Youthanasia&quot; is the best.  Opening track &quot;Reckoning Day&quot; kicks the album off with a bang, and the well known singles &quot;Train of Consequences&quot; and &quot;A Tout le Monde&quot; are good too, as is &quot;The Killing Road&quot; and &quot;Addicted to Chaos&quot;, but the rest of &quot;Youthanasia&quot; is a letdown of sorts.  It was here where Megadeth dropped their thrash sound and opted for a more melodic, catchy sound, and it almost works here, but Nick Menza's talents are wasted, and Dave Mustaine sounds completely burned out.  However, &quot;Youthanasia&quot; is not a bad album at all, but if you want real Megadeth, check out &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; and everything before it, and their latest &quot;World Needs a Hero&quot;.
078322687X|5.0|From the comedy and the laughter, to the seriousness and the teardrops, this movie will leave a trail of sensation laying at our feet for years to come. The \\"criminal\\" John Bender (Judd Nelson), \\"the athlete\\" Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), \\"the princess\\", Claire (Molly Ringwald), \\"the brain\\" Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), and  \\"the basket case\\" (Ally Sheedy). The 5 students who spent a day in detention, and changed an entire generation. The Principal, John Hughes, had an important role in this movie as the director. While the 5 were in detention, each of their assignments was to write 5,000 word essay about they thought they were. While nobody but Brian wanted to write his essay, he was provoked into writing one, that combined the movie into the serious events of that 80's Saturday and touched the hearts of millions.<br />Saturday, May 4, 1987<br />         Dear Mr. Vernon, <BR>                We accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was that we did wrong, but we think you're crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are, you see us as you want to see us, im the simplest terms, or the most conveinient definition, but what we found out is that each one of us is a brain, and a athlete, and a basketcase, a princess, and a criminal. Does that answer your question? <br />                                     Sincerely Yours, <BR>                                          The Breakfast Club
6301247485|5.0|This faithful adaptation of the F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece on the screen features some great acting by the young Robert Redford and especially by Karen Black, before she got typed an an Evil Woman in horror films of the seventies.<br />Obviously, you can't get too deeply inside the stream of consciousness or remembrance, the narrative devices on which F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel hinges, therefore you can not have a perfect adaptation of the novel to screen.<br />Other than that, the script is absolutely faithful to the novel, and even though some places are unrecognizable as Queens, New York, even in the twenties, the ostentation of Gatsby's new wealth and the style and glitter of the twenties are perfectly recreated in this film that has potential to become a classic.
0800177975|5.0|I really do not understand why this movie is disliked.  Action movies are nothing but garbage and &quot;The Last Action Hero&quot; does a fine job of mocking them.  It is absolutely hilarious and is one of my favorite movies.
6305718954|4.0|I need to address some comments made by Pat McCullough.  I agree that the film takes some liberty in saying that the Gospel of Thomas predates the New Testament.  At the very least it comes from the same period as Mathew and Luke.  However, it shows a striking resemblance to the hypothetical source document for those gospels, the &quot;Q&quot;, which must have existed in parallel to the Gospel of Mark for Mathew and Luke to be written.  It is this still hypothetical Q Gospel that may have possibly predated even the earliest version of Mark, which was probably written around 40 AD.  And Coptic is considered a form of Egyptian, not Greek.  A fragment of an earlier version written in Greek had already been discovered, so it is presumed that the original language of the Gospel of Thomas is Greek, which makes sense if one assumes it to be a partially Gnosticized version of the Q (Gnostics were like a cross between the Greek Sophists and early Christians).  The idea that Jesus was anti-orthodoxy, however, is not a uniquely Gnostic trait and still survived to some degree in the New Testament.  So even if one throws out the goofy anti-flesh &amp; circular philosophy portions of Thomas, you could still end up with a resemblance of the Q Gospel saying such things as &quot;the kingdom of heaven is inside you and all around you, but you do not realize it&quot;.  So in this sense I think the film is still not too far off the mark. (no pun intended)
B000002BUY|5.0|okay, so i went to an Incubus concert last week being indifferent towards the band, but when they played &quot;Glass&quot; something struck me... it was incredible!  Out of all of their songs, that has to be my favorite!  I got S.C.I.E.N.C.E. because of it and was in no way let down, granted that the songs were most definitely better live. S.C.I.E.N.C.E. has the most jazz-type influence mixed in with 311-type and alternative influences as well as a sound all their own, and that is what makes it unique and wonderful!  If you only own one Incubus CD or only have money to buy one CD all summer, my reccomendation would be this one!
B000063S6Z|5.0|The kind of music I like is diverse. For example: I like Nine Inch Nails, Deftones, Orbital, Fear Factory, Static-X, Tool and many others. I am now a new Moby fan. And I must say, since I have liked Orbital heavily, Moby satisfies me as well. This album is great. I like instrumental-electronic the most, but Moby can put some style to vocals :)
0345347951|5.0|Down here in Brazil it's ard to get your hands on an un-translated sci-fi novel, so I was specially gald to have borrowed this one from a friend. It's an entertaining story, that you can read in a week or less. It deals with the final future of mankind and the last 50 pages provide an equisite and unpredicable ending. As the spaceships soar over Earth's skyscrapers for decades, I found myself as anxious to find out more about them as the book's characters, who lived in the city below. A truly great read.
B00005ALP6|5.0|This is one of my favorite musicals, along with 1776. It takes its plot from Shaw's Pygmalion and does a terrifc job of turning a Broadway hit into a big-screen smash.<br />Whereas Shaw's play was an indictment of society's tendency to place birth above ability, the movie gently ignores that aspect to focus on the relationship between Higgins and Dolittle. Dr. Higgins is a noted linguist who believes that speech is the only thing that seperates us from the animals and if a person could use speech properly, that person could rise to the top of society, ignoring birth and upbringing. He attempts to prove is theory by taking Eliza Dolittle, Hepburn, an unwashed flower peddler from lower London, into his home to teach her etiquette and proper speech. His teaching transforms Eliza who becomes the rage of London society. Eliza falls for Higgins is is blissfully unaware of his feelings ntil she leaves. She returns to a happy ending.<BR>Rex Harrison is perfect as the pompous, self-satisfied, insensitive Professor Higgins. His performance is unsurpassed except for Audrey Hepburn. Her performance is one of her most brilliant and a star in her crown of achievement.<BR>The movie glosses over some of the play's biting satire, softening it, as when Higgins laments about why a woman can't be more like a man or when Eliza complains that, after her transformation, she can no longer work for a living but must be married off to a rich husband but Higgins says she can get a job in a dress boutique.<BR>For sheer escapist fun, the movie is terrific.  Get it.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I remeber watching Labyrinth when I was about 7.  Back then it seemed like a mystrious movie that I could watch over and over again.  I saw it and I loved it completely.  Then I forogt about this movie for almost 8 years.  Just recently, 5 days ago, I had strange memories come back.  I couldn't quite recall the movie, but I talked to my friends and discribed the plot.  Fortunaly, one of my friends knew just what I was talking about. My memories of the movie came back.  I rented, and watched.  It was like going back in time.  The movie is amazing and I would recommend it to just about anyone.  Whether you are a music fan or not, or you like fantasy or not, you will love Labyrith.  So, if you get a chance, please take a peak at it.
B00001ODHF|5.0|This flick is great. It is laugh out loud hilarious and witty one-liners and great action. While technically the 3rd in the Evil Dead series, the only thing it has in common is Ash (Campbell) and the Necronomicon. The opening credits try to tie them together but not very well (and look for the line holding Campbell in air).<BR>Ash is tranported to medieval Europe, supposedly 14th century England although I've never seen England look like southern CA. ANyway, initially captured as an enemy spy, Ash frees himself and his fellow captives with his chainsaw and boomstick. He becomes a hero who must quest for the Necronomicon to travel beack to his time. He retrieves the book, after battling his eveil side, but raises the army of darkness who wants the book back. Ash leads his ragtag band of fighters to victory and then returns to his \\"world\\".<BR>This bald synopsis does no justice to the rich humor and antics of this flick. THis was the first Bruce Campbell movie I saw and made me a BC fan for life. Bruce's dry wit and rugged good looks are perfect for this flick. <BR>If you want to laugh and repeat \\"Gimme some sugar, baby\\" to your sweetheart, then get this movie.
B0000668IF|4.0|Moby's last c.d. Play was one of the most well-known and overused yet brilliant dance c.d.'s ever. Coming up with a follow up to that phenomenon was always going to be difficult-yet I think on this c.d. Moby has succeeded in creating a c.d. almost as good. Those expecting Play MK2 maybe a little disappointed because this c.d. does not have as many commercial tracks that maybe exploited by companies seeking themes for their latest adverts. Thankfully though for fans of that c.d. there are certain elements that have survived. The most obvious is yes it's still essentially a dance c.d.-some of the gospel/blues dance tracks are also here in abundance. This time, however they seem to be predominantly sung by female soul vocalists. Track 2 brings us to very familiar territory-it has the standard Moby sound-drum machine, blues piano riff, lush synth chords, and the words \\"Lordy!\\" spread throughout the song-it could all have come straight from Play. Several tracks use a group called the Shining Light Gospel Choir. He also uses the marvellous Angie Stone for a track that's a unique mix of gospel meets a funkier hip-hop sound. There are quite a few tracks that are pretty similar to the sort of Chill Out sounds heard on Play from tracks such as \\"Porcelain\\". \\"Signs Of Love\\" is pretty similar in all elements-it's dreamy synth sounds, mid-tempo and of course Moby's own distinctive yet at times weedy vocals-he even attempts a falsetto! Fireworks moves even closer to those chill out moments with it's haunting woodwind sounds, shimmering piano and velvetine synth chords-this could have straight from a movie soundtrack. Another track that has a real familiar sound is the excellent \\"Sunday\\"-I mean the chords are almost identical to some tracks from Play.<br /> Well over half the tracks on this c.d. feature vocals of some sort. Moby has used his own vocals a lot more on this c.d. The first track is quite a different step from anything he's done before. Essentially \\"We Are All Made Of Stars\\" is a lo-fi sounding rock track-it certainly has elements of Bowie's \\"Heroes\\" and was quite a brave choice as first single. Initially I didn't think much of this track but after a while it becomes infectious. He does vocals on another quite different track \\"Sleep Alone\\" which has a minimalist almost trip-hop sound-on this occasion his vocal style suits the track perfectly. \\"Great Escape\\" is another departure into unknown territory-in fact Moby isn't even given any writing credits for this track. Basically it has the arrangement of a cello, synths and the marvellous harmonised vocals of Azure Ray-it's a really atmospheric and riveting ballad. \\"Harbour\\" is the longest track on the c.d. it features vocals from Sinéad O'Connor-I'm not sure if I like her vocals on this track-it just seems to roll on and on without ever really taking off. Very few synths are to be heard-there's some gorgeous guitar before rich orchestration takes over.<br /> Moby states that he wrote 150 songs for this c.d. and had great difficulty whittling it all down to 18 tracks. In some ways that would be one of my few criticisms of this c.d.-it does sprawl a great deal. Maybe he could have lost a few tracks, especially as one or two sound almost identical to each other. At 71 minutes this c.d. takes a long time to get familiar with-it's been a long weekend of leaving this c.d. on repeat. My overriding opinion would be that this c.d. has lots of good tracks, is a significant development from his last c.d., but it could have a sprinkling of more stand out tracks just to recapture you're attention when the interest begins to wane. Worth buying definitely though!
B00005QHPQ|5.0|I'm very found of music but when i listen this CD, I became an musical instrument myself and started working. In short I'll say that the music in the CD is like my soul and the song \\"I'll survive\\" is my favourite song.<BR>SHAHZAD

B00005A1PR|5.0|Regardless of what the Grammy committee must have been thinking, this album is my personal Album of The year.  &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot; is right on the same level as &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;.  It is far better and deserves more recognition than what some other over-rated artists have been receiving.  India gives a beautiful, inspiring message through each and every song.  Her words are empowering, and any woman or man can relate to them.  The rhythm and beats are also jamming, backed up by the soulful strings of India's acoustic guitar playing.  If you have not gotten this album, please do so.  It is definitely worth the money.  I hope that India eventually gets the recognition that she deserves in the music industry, but even if she doesn't, this one is still a gem.
6304708491|5.0|I hate to review a movie that has already received 84 reviews, but I feel the need to add my voice to the cacophany.<br />&quot;Help!&quot; is one of the finest expressions of the absurdist humor that began with Peter Sellers and the Goon Show (Sellers, Spike Milligan, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine) and led to Monty Python and its many North American imitators (including the National Lampoon and Second City crews who gave birth to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;).  This movie was the first large-scale exposure of such humor to the North American masses.<br />The Beatles idolized the Goons.  They were among the handful of people in England who knew who George Martin was before he became their producer ... because he had produced the Goons' records.  They were also among the thimbleful of people who knew Richard Lester before he directed &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; ... because he directed Sellers and Milligan in the 12-minute silent cult classic &quot;The Running Jumping &amp; Standing Still Film&quot; (included here as an Easter egg).  &quot;Help!&quot; was the Beatles' attempt to emulate or even surpass their heroes ... and they succeeded magnificently, since the Goons were never filmed well except in Lester's short.<br />The plot is a classic &quot;chase&quot; movie theme: Ringo has the sacrificial ring of the goddess Kahili stuck on his finger and ultimately is designated as the next sacrifice, so the Beatles have to run, while a mad scientist and Scotland Yard are also in hot pursuit.  But the plot is insignificant.  Simply, the Beatles are put in one funny situation after another, with superb comedic support from Leo McKern (&quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot;), Tony Award-winner Victor Spinetti, Roy Kinnear and Patrick Cargill.  The Goons couldn't have done it better themselves.<br />As another reviewer noted, &quot;Help!&quot; was also the beginning of the Beatles' most creative period musically, although only John's tunes in the movie stand out (&quot;Help&quot;, &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;, and &quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot; -- Paul's &quot;Yesterday&quot; is on the soundtrack but not in the film).  But don't buy &quot;Help!&quot; for the music.  Don't buy &quot;Help!&quot; for the Beatles' performances (BTW, George is the best actor).  Buy it because it's hilarious, and it looks effortless.  (In fact, it looked so effortless that it convinced Paul that the Beatles could make their own comedy film without Lester -- which became the disastrous flop &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;.  But that's another story.)  Buy it to see the REAL Beatles, not the saintly whitewashed version being marketed today.
1573222038|5.0|This book left me breathless with admiration and enjoyment. I can think of no novelist writing today so accomplished on multiple levels as is Sarah Waters. Fingersmith is first a great story. The plot grabs the reader's attention from the beginning and remains compelling to the last word. Yes, it's a page-turner! But so much more.... The literary depth is extraordinary; the writing is flawless; the characters are perfectly drawn; the scholarship remarkable. Superlatives cannot adequately describe how interesting, intelligent, rich, wise, and just plain good this book is. Bravo!
B0000668IF|5.0|On Moby's latest album \\"18\\" the man takes influences from his early days and combines it with the skill and professionalism that made \\"Play\\" possible.  The tone behind \\"18\\" is much more relaxed and Moby once again impresses with his airy melodies and lush keyboard arpeggios, sounding very reminiscent of 1995's \\"Everything is Wrong.\\"  There are, unfortunately, limited parts of the album that will actually make you want to bounce off your chair, and no new ground is being broken.<br />\\"18\\" will not be the commercial success \\"Play\\" was, yet it is not exactly a failure.  In fact, tracks such as \\"We Are All Made Of Stars\\" and \\"In This World\\" truly shine.  Heck, I'd even venture to say the art & design on this CD are stupendous!!  The only problem I have with \\"18\\" is that Moby is almost trying too hard to make everybody happy.  Take for example a track on here called \\"Jam For The Ladies.\\"  Now if music is one of the best ways for an artist to express himself or herself, then Moby has lost some credibility here.  In fact, it's just plain weird...<br />>> Aww but what the heck, I think this album deserves 5 stars.  Really quite an enjoyable disc.  Go Mobes!!<br />- the enlightened one
B000059Z8J|5.0|Richard Donner's 1978 film SUPERMAN has to be one of the most misunderstood films of all time. In an age where it's \\"hip\\" to deconstruct superhero characters and make them grim-n-gritty and/or vapid teen idols, the movie can't help but come off as a valentine to a bygone era. And with the advent of SMALLVILLE and a proposed new Superman movie (in which producer Jon Peters and his crew have been trying for the past 10 years to radically alter everything about the character except the name), even Superman fans have taken to bashing Donner's film, sneering at it as being \\"campy,\\" too reverential of the source material, and too \\"dated.\\" <br />And yet...nothing could be further from the truth. Far from being \\"dated,\\" SUPERMAN is just as fresh and timely today as it was 24 years ago, and the spectacular digital restoration (including a new sound FX track-the original had deteriorated) makes the movie look just as fresh and new as the latest box-office hits. Even more impressive is how the special effects have held up; except for three brief front-projection shots, you can still believe a man can fly. I can only imagine that the \\"dated\\" claims have to do with the film being 24 years old and having been made before CGI and choppy MTV-style editing came into use, because there's nothing else about the film that dates it to the 1970s. (Do yourselves a favor and watch the 3 documentaries on the DVD. They give incredible insight into how much work was put into the film.) <br />And then there's the script, by Tom Mankiewicz (credited to Mario Puzo, David and Leslie Newman, and Robert Benton). When producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind first developed the project, they intended it to be a camp comedy. When Donner and Mankiewicz came aboard, the film was altered into a serious piece, and the end result is magical. We're given an epic depiction of the origin of Superman, beginning with the Krypton holocaust, going thru his childhood in Smallville, and finally ending up in Metropoliswhere the adult Superman faces his first trial-by-fire in his encounter with Lex Luthor. The story has plenty of humor in it, but it's still played straight, and runs the entire gamut of emotions. The oft-criticized ending, in which Lois dies in an earthquake and a grieving Superman defies his oath to not interfere with human history by flying back in time to save her, is the defining character moment for Superman. In defying the orders of his father and following his heart, Superman rejects his alien heritage and embraces his humanity. It's a great moment, but yet it's one that too many people are quick to bash because \\"he can save anybody that way.\\" They don't see what it really means as a character bit. Making the story even stronger is Donner's taut, reverent direction, as well as some truly great acting. Christopher Reeve IS Clark Kent/Superman, body and soul (his own size mirrors the physical stats of the comic book character). Playing the role with heart and conviction, Reeve literally becomes the character made flesh. Marlon Brando, in his small role as Jor-El, is also excellent, bringing a commanding dignity to film. Gene Hackman's sociopathic Luthor, a guy who merrily jokes and brags about himself while planning an act of genocide simply to make big real estate money, is both funny and chilling. Add to this knockout trio fine performances by an international cast of superstars, and the film comes alive. Also of note is the powerful score by John Williams. Those condemn this score as being \\"too heroic\\" need to have their hearing checked. Williams delivers more than just heroism; he captures the eerie ambiance of Krypton, the rural warmth of Smallville, and the romanticism and tragedy of Superman and Lois' relationship beautifully. And to cap it all off, he gives Superman one of the most unforgettable fanfares in film history. Further strengthening the film is Stuart Baird's brisk, punchy editing; John Barry's lavish production designs (including the memorable crystalline Krypton); Yvonne Blake's clever costuming (the glowing Krypton costumes, and a flawless rendering of Superman's classic suit); and Geoffrey Unsworth's misty, ethereal cinematography, which enhances the fairy tale aspects of the character. Every step of the way, the film successfully brings Superman and his world to life.<br />That said, SUPERMAN has its flaws. Ned Beatty's Otis character is mostly a non-entity; he doesn't really add anything to the proceedings. And Margot Kidder is badly miscast as Lois; not only is she far too tomboyish to play what in the comics is a glamorous character, but she comes off more like Reeve's vapid sister than she does a feisty love interest. Their scenes only work because Reeve makes us buy into the movie. Watching the screen test for Anne Archer-a much better and much better-looking actress, I can't help wondering why she wasn't cast as Lois instead. She would have been perfect opposite Reeve. (But to be fair to Kidder, she was way better than most of the other actresses tested-Stockard Channing in particular was awful.) And there's a really careless glitch when Superman saves Air Force One; the film is reversed when he grabs the plane, so his emblem and spit-curl are both backwards. But in the end, those flaws aren't enough to weaken SUPERMAN's impact. It was and still is not only the best comic book movie ever, but it's also one of the finest films ever made, period. Those who bash the classic version of Superman and this film while supporting the planned Jon Peters version should definitely reconsider their stance. This is not an inept drek-fest like BATTLEFIELD EARTH, nor is it a heartless, soulless mess like the Peters film promises to be. This is a beautiful, heartfelt piece of Americana, crafted with love and respect. SUPERMAN deserves to be seen as the classic it is, not to be disrespected and forgotten.
B00001NFCY|4.0|Excellent collection of songs, but it represents a subtle departure from the themes and production that made My Own Prison such a breakthrough album.
B000002VRZ|3.0|At their height, the Outlaws were a formidable band capable of riveting hard rock (\\"Green Grass & High Tides\\"), lilting country ballads (\\"Girl From Ohio\\") and stomping, hell-raising hoedowns (\\"Knoxville Girl\\").<br /><br />  Their brilliant 1975 debut ('The Outlaws') was an excellent representation of their abilities. Such was that album's skillfull melding of hard and soft, rock and country, that it went gold within weeks of its release. Not an inconsiderable feat for a largely-unknown band operating on a brand-new label without a multi-million dollar hype machine behind it.<br /><br />  More likely for the album's commercial success (besides its obvious musical merit) was a slot opening for the Doobie Brothers on their Fall, 1975 'Stampede' tour. At a September date in the old Chicago Stadium, the Outlaws turned 20,000 hard-core Doobie Brothers fans into instant converts. I was among many who were brought to their feet by \\"Green Grass & High Tides\\" that night, and by the end of the raucous \\"Knoxville Girl\\", was hootin' and hollerin' like a life-long cowboy.<br /><br />  I wasn't alone in the thought that I could've gone home at that point, feeling completely that I had gotten my money's worth. To myself and anyone else who saw this early incarnation of the Outlaws, it marked them as a band to watch.<br /><br />  They didn't always follow up on the promise of that sterling debut, but they did manage another fine LP (1977's 'Hurry Sundown') and recorded much else that deserved to be heard. Unfortunately, they are today an unjustly forgotten member of what was then known as \\"Southern Rock\\".<br /><br />  Which brings me to Arista's remastering and reissue program of the first three Outlaw LPs and the release of a new compilation: 'Best Of The Outlaws...Green Grass & High Tides'<br /><br />  No Outlaws fan would quibble with the fact that nearly a third of the CDs tracks (5 of 16) are from the debut. As mentioned before, it's wonderful. And the inclusion of \\"(Ghost) Riders In The Sky\\"? Of course. It was their last hit. \\"You Are The Show\\"? Okay. Even though 'Playin' To Win' (their fourth LP released in 1979) was a middling affair, it had a few nuggets worth remembering.<br /><br />  My problem with this collection is the under-representation of 'Hurry Sundown', represented here by a measley two tracks. That's what 'Playin' To Win'--a vastly inferior album--got. And why is 1976's 'Lady In Waiting'--an infuriatingly uneven album--represented with more tracks than any other Outlaws album? (That isn't to say it's a bad album--just an uneven one. Indeed, the aforementioned \\"Girl From Ohio\\", \\"Prisoner\\" and \\"Freeborn Man\\" are wonderful and completely deserving.)<br /><br />  But virtually any of 'Hurry Sundown's seven remaining tracks would be an improvement over the utterly forgettable \\"Breaker Breaker\\", \\"South Carolina\\", \\"Stick Around For Rock & Roll\\" and \\"Take It Anyway You Want It\\". As would an especially hot live track or an illuminating demo.<br /><br />  The remastered sound is great, the liner notes informative, but I've docked 'Best Of The Outlaws' a star because of its weak track selection that leaves one of the band's essential albums practically unrepresented.<br /><br />  And that's a shame.last hit. \\"You Are The Show\\"?

1586210912|3.0|Hello, I just want to clarify some misconceptions made within the book concerning the author's poor father. First, one fact the author does not mention that he mentioned in a previous book that he wrote, was that he lost his dad's retirement money in a business venture that had failed many years before this book was even written. The reason why his father was broke when he reached retirement age was because he let his son use his money and his son had lost it all. <BR>Secondly, his poor father was an incredibly brilliant and smart man, but I don't think his father was motivated as much by money as the author's rich father. The author's poor father was an educator who decided early on to dedicate his life towards educating people. For example, most priests die poor and penniless only because they were not focused so much on making money as they were on dedicating their lives to God. I am sure if the poor dad was focused on making money he too would have been incredibly rich probably even more so than the rich father since he was probably just as disciplined and even smarter. <br />But, I would like to say thank you to the poor father for his dedication to the bettermnent of education. I am actually impressed that he would dedicate his life to promoting and improving the knowledge in today's educational system. That to me is the ultimate in public service and should be commended.
B00004YA66|5.0|\\"Frequency\\" was one of the many surprise hits of 2000.  I was a successul mixture of suspense, action, Science Fiction, drama and a father-son realtionship movie.  What best descibes the excitment of \\"Frequency is the idea it asks...what if?<br />What if you had the opportunity to communicate with a family member, that's been dead for 30 years?  What would you say?  What would you do?  And what if you had the opportunity to change the past and the future?  John Francis \\"Little Chief\\" Sullivan, portrayed by the talented Jim Caviezel (\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\", \\"Angel Eyes\\"), is a 36-year old police detective who's going through a period in his life where time is a bad one.  His girlfriend just left him and his job is not cutting him any slack.  On the night of the 30th aniversary of John's father's death, a fire-fighter who died 30 years ago in a warehouse fire, the Aroura Boleias spreads over Queens, New York, where John lives in the house he lived in as a kid.  He then finds his dad's old HAM radio in the closet, which is uses soon enough.  He comes into contact with a mysterious person who claims to be Frank Patrick Sullivan, John's dad.  Little does John know is that he IS John's dad!!!  Apparently, the Northern lights transmitted the frequency from the radio, all the way back to 1969!  Frank, played by acclaimed actor Dennis Quaid,is a 1960's fire fighter, the night before his death, when he contacts John in the future.  John ultimately warns his father about his death and he avoids the catastrophe.  John's life is then radically changed.  Every night, he talks to his Dad over on the radio, which he hasn't talk to in over 30 years.  But the next night after they mae contact, John makes a shocking discovery that his Mother,Julia Sullivan (Elizabeth Mitchell) was murdered only weeks later in Frank's time.  John and Frank now must chase after the murderer before it happens to Jules, in order for them to live a life they dreampt of.  <br />\\"Frequency\\" is a touching and fast paced story that never ceases to stop entertaining.  The DVD includes several bonus material, including a documentary on the making of, Theatrical trailers and a DVD-ROM that includes a game demo and others. I love the main menu on the DVD, where it plays the Main Theme over and over.  Great DVD, even better movie.

0553296981|5.0|This is a truly wonderful book.  I was surprised to read that some people described this book as \\"tedious\\" and another reviewer described Anne as \\"spoiled and self centered\\".  These are not accurate descriptions of her or the book.  Anne Frank went through so much during the course of her short life.  What surprised me the most was that through everything that happened, she always had hope.  This book takes you through all the difficulties and joys of her teenage years: trials with her parents, her first love, and learning to be grateful for her situation.  This book changed my way of thinking.  It showed me how much I took for granted, and it opened my eyes and allowed me to see how much these people suffered in one of the most terrifying and evil periods of history.
B000065AI3|4.0|It took about a year from this album's November, 1976 release for it to reach me, but when it did, it brought joy. At the time, very little sounded like it, and I loved it.<br /><br />From the moody \\"Luna\\" to the flat-out, percolating \\"Rockin' Around (With You)\\" to the menacing \\"Fooled Again (I Don't Like It)\\" to the magnificent, chugging \\"Strangered In The Night\\" to the clipped, all-amped-up-with-nowhere-to-go energy that pervades \\"Anything That's Rock 'N' Roll\\", this album was almost too good, too developed, too fully-realized to be a debut. But it was.<br /><br />And twenty-five years on, it still sounds fresh. Potent. Invigorating. And thankfully, it remains (with the possible exception of \\"American Girl\\" or \\"Breakdown\\") untouched by classic rock radio.<br /><br />As Bill Flanagan notes in his wonderful essay, \\"The band went on to make lots of records, some better than this.\\" But very few. Front to back, Tom Petty eclipsed this album perhaps two or three times in his Hall of Fame career.<br /><br />I'm happy to report that the remastering is a vast improvement over the original's wooden sound, which was done on the cheap for a dying record company. But given that 'Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' is barely thirty minutes long, I would've liked a demo or two, or some early live tracks added to this remastered edition.<br /><br />If memory serves, ABC/Shelter released an \\"official\\" bootleg of an early Petty show from the Paradise in Boston about this time, and it was hot stuff. Where are those tracks?<br /><br />But the sheer joy of the music contained herein render those complaints minor at best. This album has lost nothing in the quarter-century since its release.<br /><br />I only hope I age this well.

B00005RFAI|2.0|I bought this CD because I like the song &quot;Let's get the party started.&quot;  But, frankly, it was a waste of money.  The CD is horrible.  The lyrics are harsh and full of language I wouldn't want to blare.  Big mistake.  I wish &quot;Let's get the party started&quot; was on a single - then I could sell this CD &amp; just get the single.   &quot;Pink&quot; (the gal) has an attitude and I hope some day she gets rid of the mean attitude - it shows in her music, and that's NOT a good thing.  GOOD music is born out of love - not hatred.
0316921173|3.0|Wallace's language (voice) is breath-taking, awe-inspiring, and wrenchingly self-conscious.  I am impressed, and cannot help but think that that was Wallace's intention all along.  The book is a whir of dizzying perspectives, exotic vocabulary and, well, gargantuan (a trophy for coffeetables around the globe).  Certainly worth reading, and telling everyone within a fifty-mile radius that you've done so.  At the end, though, this massive novel does not succeed in forming a new perspective within the reader, an outlook that the reader carries with her/him after the back cover is slammed shut.  <br />That said, when the ugly demon of self-consciousness does not raise his pointed head within this novel, the writing is extraordinary and, in places, profound.  If only the sparse profundity could have been amplified and distended, this could very well have been one of the greatest novels in American literature.

0307155102|4.0|Richard Scarry's Best Word Book Ever was a favorite in our family when we were growing up in the 1970's.  I bought a new book to share with my one-year-old daughter and it has become one of her favorites.  She will page through the book on her own, pointing at different objects in the book and naming them.<br />My big complaint is that the editors have made extensive changes to the original book.  Not only are many pages missing, but there has been a great effort to change artwork and characters in deference to political correctness.  Where I thought many of the original characters could be thought to be either male or female, the editors have decided that there were not enough characters that were obviously female, so they have gone back and stuck bows on their heads.  It seems they fear that kids will think that women can't work in construction unless they depict a bear with a bow stuck to her head driving a roller.  While I believe that little girls can dream of doing any of these occupations, I don't think you need a bow in your hair to be female and I don't think you need to mess with the author's original classic illustrations.<br />Of course, my daughter is not comparing the book to a previous superior version; she just loves it as it is.

A short while later I purchased this release and within a matter of months I had compulsively collected all her releases. I have Diana under my skin, that's what she does best and what Lance G Rigley said so eloquently.  She captures you in her spell and doesnt let go.  I play this over and over and still cannot help myself, I remain with the overwhelming urge to hear her soft, dusky romantic tones, the rapture returning in equal amounts each and every time I play the cd.  <br />I'm so glad Ms Krall is held in such regard, what a wonderful talent she is and I have no hesitation in recommending her works.  I'm sure that one day in the future we shall fondly regard Diana's voice as one of the all time classics in the great hall of jazz vocalists.  This cd is quite simply the finest purchase I ever made.
6300214826|5.0|Before Oliver Stone and Stanley Kubrick tackled the subject of the Vietnam War in two controversial movies that were brought to worldwide acclaim, veteran filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola (fresh from his success in The Godfather) brought to the cinema screens a powerful, controversial film about Vietnam, and the madness that followed with it. It also depicted the darker side of man, and how the bush wars of Southeast Asia brought out the worst in people. Since its debut in 1979, Coppola's Apocalypse Now has gone on to become a classic film and one of two accurate descriptions of the Vietnam Conflict. It also became one of The american Film Institute's 100 Greatest Movies of all time.<br />Twenty-two years after the film's release, the explosively violent film was re-released under the current new title, with fufty minutes of never before seen footage. With a running time of three hours and thirty minutes, the film is just as better and is shown the way as it was meant to be seen. as Coppola has stated, \\"It is sexier, funnier, more bizarre, more romantic, and is more politically intriguing.\\" Indeed, not only is it a more richer, fuller, textured film experience, it also provides clear facts as to how the British and the American public were lied to. It also lets the audience feel the immediacy, the insanity, the brutality, the exhilaration, the sensuousness, the horror, the hypocracy, and the moral dilemma of America's most surreal, losing, and nightmarish war. It also certainly more enjoyable than reading Sarah Dailey's one dimesional column pieces in The Louisville Cardinal.<br />The film tells the story of U.S. Army Captain Benjamin Willard, who is given orders by his superiors to locate renegade Army Green Beret Colonel Walter E. Kurtz and \\"terinate his command with extreme prejudice.\\" Apparently, Kurtz has taken matters into his own hands, concerning how the war should be fought. After ruthlessly killing three South Vietnamese Officers whom he believed were to bedouble agents, Kurtz and his army of native tribesmen have gone on to killing both North and South Vietnamese soldiers in the most brutal, violent, and unsound of all fashions. Beyond the pale of human conduct and acting without any decent restraint. Journeying up the Nung River into war-torn Cambodia in a U.S. Navy Patrol Boat, Willard begins to learn more about Kurtz and his life. Along the way, he and four Navy officers cross paths with a trigger happy Air Calvary Colonel and his troops, a group of touring Playboy Centerfolds, and (through an unfortunate discovery) a French Plantation left over from the French-Vietnam Conflict of the 1950's.<br />After a skirmish with native tribesmen and Viet Cong soldiers that result in the deaths of three of the Navy officers, Willard and the surviving Navy sailor arrive at the compund where Kurtz and his army are holed up. With the help of an eccentric photojournalist, Willard encounters Kurtz. Upon learning a few things from Kurtz and knowing that the Colonel has gone completely insane, Willard has to decide whether to follow his orders or join a madman who has started to play God. What follows is not only very atmospheric, but very thought-provoking and deeply unsettling.<br />Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen, Harrison Ford, Robert Duvall, and all of the other actors do a remarkable job in the roles they were given. Most of all, coppola really tackles the controversial subject of a useless war with gritty realism. The extra scenes that are placed back into the film, fit seamlessly and add an extra dimension to the plot. It also portrays the cynicism of the late 1960's, and how any person can lose his or her sanity, with violent results. One can also feel extreme sympathy for the character of Kurtz. As always, Brando does a remarkable performance. By making Kurtz a tragic figure, Brando is able to make a very good argument as to how the war should be fought and how to resolve the conflict. As his character states near the end ofthe film, \\"DROP THE BOMB! EXTERMINATE THEM ALL!!!\\" Many Vietnam veterans have been wishing that such a thing had happened. Sheen also gives an excellent performance as Willard, who is given the regretful task of killing such a brilliant, if not deranged man.<br />If you enjoy war movies, subjects about the turbulent '60's, and Vietnam, you will enjoy this remarkable, if not explosive masterpiece of violent art. It will also make you think and realize that if you don't make friends out of horror and mortal terror, you will be in a serious and uncompromising situation. One with two enemies that are not to be reckoned with.
B00003CXXJ|1.0|shrek.......  what garbage. i had heard from a friend who had went to see it that it wasn't very funny, but i decided to rent it, just to see.  she was dead on.  a lack of humor plagues this movie, and really crushes the great talent behind it (meyers, murphey, and diaz.) There was 1!!! funny scene in this movie, where the gingerbread man cookie says eat me.  Otherwise, this movie included a lot eye-rolling.  Regardless, its a good story, and an original idea, just one that was very poorly made.  This seems to be one of those movies where people are just laughing because other people who don't know what funny is, are.  And because of this, they are making a sequel, which is unfortunate, unless they fix this up. ...
B00005GL0Q|5.0|\\"Revolver\\" (1966) continues the transitional period begun the year before with \\"Rubber Soul\\" that saw the \\"early\\" Beatles become the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" Beatles who preferred the creativity of the studio over live performance.  The influence of producer George Martin was never more evident than it was on \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" on which the instrumentation consists of only strings rather than electric guitars.  But in addition to the move towards more sophisticated music there was a corresponding elevation of the lyrics as well.  I have seen English textbooks use the lyrics of \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" as poetry worthy of literary analysis, while the lyrics of \\"She Said, She Said\\" were inspired by the drug induced comment of Peter Fonda at a part (where he told Lennon \\"I know what it's like to be dead\\"), which reflected the psychedelic aspects of the Beatles at this point.  Consequently, when the Beatles do provide a love song, such as \\"Here, There and Everywhere,\\" it evinces an actual attempt to be introspective rather than simply cute.<br /><br />Harrison makes his presence known with three songs on this album, including the opening \\"Taxman\\" number, which builds upon his efforts on \\"Rubber Soul,\\" where he had two songs plus his sitar work on \\"Norwegian Wood.\\"  The eastern musical influences personified by Harrison's \\"Love You To\\" is also seen on some of the Lennon & McCartney numbers, most notably \\"I'm Only Sleeping.\\"  As for the final member of the Fab Four, certainly \\"Yellow Submarine\\" was the most popular if not the best of the songs written for Ringo to sing (I prefer \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" from the \\"White Album,\\" but that might simply be because \\"Yellow Submarine\\" was done to death long before the animated film was produced).<br /><br />I doubt that I am alone in considering \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Revolver\\" to be a set of albums, because it really is difficult to listen to one without the other since they are the bridge by which the Beatles got from \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" to \\"A Day In The Life.\\"  Consequently, it becomes clear that with \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" it was not so much that the Beatles were doing something completely different, but rather that they had essentially abandoned the search for simple pop tunes to dominate the charts.  A key element of the greatness of the Beatles is that when they were the biggest success in music history they opted for growth as song writers and musicians.e Life.\\"  Consequently, it becomes clear that with \\"Sgt.

B0000634EV|1.0|I was so excited for this album to come out, having totally loved the debut, \\"Nola\\". I was looking forward to hearing great tunes like \\"Underneath Everything\\" and \\"Jail\\". I was looking forward to those great riffs that just simply rocked!..... then I actually listened to it.<br />If I had to name one big disappointment of the year it'd almost certainly be this cd (well, the new Rasputina could certainly tie). I gave this cd about 4 listens on the first day and a few more in the days following, and I couldn't find one noteworthy song. The entire album is bad! I guess that should be expected when it's being advertised that the album was written AND recorded in just 28 days. Come on guys, that would be worth mentioning if the cd was any good.<br />I couldn't believe this cd came from the same guys who did \\"Nola\\". I'd love to go down the track list one by one and describe how each song is bad, but I can't. Because all the songs were so bland, I can't remember anything about them. To be sure I will be selling this cd off very soon.
0385505833|2.0|This book seems like something Grisham whipped together in a week to release just before the Christmas season last year.  Granted it worked out wonderfully for him, another #1 bestseller, but this is a short one-day read, nothing groundbreaking.<br />Grisham fans will likely pick this one up, but what you get for what you pay is a tragedy.  At 176 pages this one may never see the light of paperback.  It's not a bad book by any means, but certainly not the most stimulating.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I read all the books and saw the movie with my family we all had a really good time with lots of laughs.  Most parents that have seen it would agree its a good movie to sit around and watch with the family.  As for the the movie goes, they did cut a lot from the books but it still made sense even after i had read the book and for people who haven't read the book it still an awesome moive. I one-hundred percent recomend this DVD to ANYONE or ANY COLLECTION. A must have.
B00005Y1TL|1.0|Even if you are an absolutely fanatical Aphex Twin devotee (and I am), you can safely ignore this disc.  The otherwise talented n' tasteful Richard James should have left this one locked up in the vault.  Yeah, he was 14 years old while working on some of this stuff...  and it shows.  Even by the relaxed standards of the 'ambient' genre, I found this album predictable, dated and boring.  There's nothing on here that hasn't been done before, and better, by other artists.<br />Sorry to disagree with the rest of the reviews, but my advice is:  Skip this one.
0743216458|5.0|Stephen Ambrose has written another excellent book on WWII, this time from the perspective of Easy Company, arguably the top rifle company in the entire war.  What makes his writing special is his access to first hand eyewitness accounts of WWII veterans, to give readers an incredibly detailed portrayal of what is was like to be on the front line, from training through the end of the war.<br />One thing to keep in mind is that this book was written by Mr. Ambrose for Easy Company, NOT for himself.  A lot of his writing revolves around eyewitness accounts, and naturally an item may be misconstrued or stated in a way that favors Easy Company.  Some may be quick to point out flaws in the testimonials, but don't let this take away from the book.  Every minute invested in reading this book is worth it.<br />Ambrose readers shouldn't pass this book up, and I hope those who watched the miniseries would read the book as well.  The people of Easy Company, and everyone who fought the war, earned this book.
B00003CXTG|2.0|What is this? I thought this was about Pearl Harbor? The whole thing was practically swallowed by the love story!!! The only bit of WAR I saw was near the end of the movie. Oh yeah, one more thing: This movie is not R-rated. It's PG-13. It says so on the back of the DVD.
B00003CXI1|3.0|Before I start, let me assure you that this isn't a \\"my wizard is better than your wizard\\" rant. But, considering that Rowling's work was just the Lord of the Rings re-written (and a much less quality work). Yes, I know. I'm going to get \\"not helpful\\" votes. But I'm just pointing it out. Now, don't get me wrong. I enjoy Harry Potter, and, no, I don't think it's evil. However, it can't be ignored that Dumbledore is just an underdeveloped Gandalf with glasses. Dementors are simply Black Riders with rotted hands. Anyone who has read Lord of the Rings will know what I'm talking about. They look the same, and have the same effect on people as Black Riders. In the Lord of the Rings, Sauron is referred to as \\"He whom we will not name\\". Sound familiar, anyone? I'm not saying that Rowling has no original ideas, but I am saying that she should recognize where she got the basis for them.
B00005YXZH|5.0|In 2002, pop albums aren't supposed to require much of you as a listener. In a culture where taglines and 30-second TV spots are indelibly ingrained into your brainpan in moments, asking the casual listener to give any level of thought beyond the immediate knee-jerk reaction seems as unlikely as...a jetliner crashing into the World Trade Center or a G.W. Bush presidency. Apparently, that's what Reprise was thinking when they let Wilco free after hearing this record. Do yourself a favor.  Don't fall asleep at the switch like the Reprise execs did.  Listen to the music.  It's an amazing record.  Beautiful, challenging lyrically and sonically, a world unto itself that absolutely requires you to give in to its subtle, insistent power. Give a little effort; it's well worth it.
B000002HEP|5.0|Welcome to Sky Valley is the second of three masterpieces written by Kyuss, and is possibly their finest composition. Certainly, Sky Valley captures a unique and original ambience, and this is due in no small part to the album's impeccable production by Chris Goss. It was through Goss that Kyuss learned to get it right - he recognised their huge potential and intuitively understood them. He also had the skill to extract from Kyuss the live vibe that they were all about and put it on record. Further to all this, Sky Valley is arguably the album that, more than any other, sparked the creation of the entire stoner rock movement.<br />Make no bones about it: Sky Valley is heavy as lead...but heavy in a somehow tasteful way. It does not abandon harmony for dissonance  it is loud, yet subtle, and the sound is rich and viscous. The melodies are sweet, groovy and visceral. Unlike most heavy music, you can listen to Sky Valley at almost any time  you dont have to be pissed off or hyperactive...its more of a feel-good vibe than an angry one. Long, slow, roomy jams feature alongside booming bursts of electric energy. And listen as you may, each time you'll notice something new - a guitar lick you missed, or a percussion instrument you didn't realise was there.  <br />There is something very special about this album. Though perhaps not its overt intention, Sky Valley is implicitly an ode to the immense landscapes of the Californian desert  the bands home. There is an impression of great open spaces here...a notion of huge, sun-baked vistas  dusty, barren, yet beautiful. Kyuss, particularly on this album, appear to owe much of their creative stimulus to the awe of nature. (Maybe to the smoking of nature, too.)<br />Kyuss have a relatively small following of die-hard fans, fans that often bemoan the bands lack of widespread recognition. Its true that they deserve such recognition, for the music is of the highest calibre in heavy rock, but perhapsthis is more a blessing than a curse. Kyuss are a legend  the quintessential unsung gods of rock, and somehow its more fitting that way.<BR>If I could recommend just one album to anyone, anywhere, it would be this one. Trust me, itll be the best money youll ever spend.
0446310786|5.0|\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is truly a classic.  It is by far, my most favorite novel.  In this story, there is a lot of racism.  I think this is what the main theme of the story is.  There are two sides of racism.  One has to do with blacks and whites, and the other has to do with the town and Boo Radley.  I felt this was important because it showed that people are not only prejudice when it comes to race, but also when it comes to social class or people just being different from other people.  People are afraid of things, people, and situations that are unknown to them.  When they are afraid of the unknown, they strike out in very unkind ways.  Sometimes they use words, and sometimes it can get very physical as when the lynch mob came to Atticus and he was unarmed.  <BR>Also, another theme that really stood out was maturation.  Scout and Jem grew up and matured throughout the book.  I think they saw how cruel people could treat other people because of the color of their skin, or maybe just what they believed in.  The situations Jem and Scout were put in made them think twice about what they believed in, which tends to make people grow up quickly.  Atticus also changed throughout the story.  I think that the situation Atticus was in would make anyone change because hatred and anger can make people say and do things they wouldn't normally do.  I think there were times when Atticus was very quiet due to the fact that he had so many emotions inside him.  I'm sure through time, he felt the animosity of the town's people.  I think after awhile, that would really get to someone.  I liked Atticus because he fought for what he believed in and didn't give up even though it was hard.  Another character who changed in the story was Boo Radley.  In the beginning, no one hears from him or even sees him.  Toward the end of the story, he is seen more, and is more spoken of.  I think that he was becoming less afraid of people.  In the end when he saves Jem and Scout's lives, he showsgreat courage and I think that is very admirable.
B00003CX96|5.0|What I always found fascinating about \\"Breaking Away\\" was how it very gently dealt with the issue of unhappy people pretending to be something other than they are. Dave Stohler creates a whole new world for himself by pretending to be a charming Italian born exchange student, which in dark contrast to what he really is. He gets so into character he seduces a young female student and in the process the two fall in love. The most dramatic scene in the film is when Dave tells her the truth of who he really is. The most touching scene is when days later the two say goodbye. In this scene the girl, who appears over with her anger at Dave's deception tells him she is going to Europe for the summer. When Dave responds that he \\"is not going anywhere\\" .The girle responds back in a touching and gentle manner, \\" I don't know about that.\\" Get this DVD.
B000066C1N|5.0|In a phenomenal return to form, Bryan Adams & the incomparable Hans Zimmer team up for a real treat of a soundtrack! Hans Zimmer, best known for his work on Gladiator, Pearl Harbor, and The Rock, proves that he's got more tricks up his sleeve - the beautiful & complex orchestra behind \\"Run Free\\" is a truly marvelous piece of work, and the other two songs on here that are entirely orchestrated (with no lyrics) are \\"Homeland\\" and \\"Rain,\\" also beautiful tunes by whom I consider the master of the movie score arena: Hans Zimmer.<BR>  One master of his genre would be superb, but when you team him with another, you know you're in for a wild ride! Bryan Adams, who has been unpleasantly absent from the US since his 1998 release \\"On A Day Like Today,\\" returns with gusto to give us a roller-coaster of a ride. The opener \\"Here I Am\\" (not \\"I Will Always Return\\" as Amazon states above) is almost guaranteed to go straight to mainstream adult contemporary radio play, while other solid and beautiful songs \\"I Will Always Return,\\" \\"This Is Where I Belong,\\" and the Sarah McLachlan duo \\"Don't Let Go\\" are strong additions to the album. Looking at the credits, we see Bryan and Mr. Zimmer collaborated on most of these tunes, and it's easy to hear the consistency and power of the music - they're a real dynamic team-up! I hope we can expect another collaboration from these two leaders of their respective fields! <BR>  In case you're wondering just what old Bryan has been doing lately, he's got another album coming down the pike not too long from now (we hope!), and his \\"Greatest Hits Part 2\\" album, entitled \\"Best of Me\\" is just now making it stateside - check it out, you won't regret it!
0345350499|5.0|I love this book I read it only becuse the movie cought myu attention.  After reading it I can never put it down I also own the Forest House, Lady of Avalon, and the Pristess of Avalon.  I love them all !!!!!
B0000667RO|5.0|Whether you're a Badfan or not (a fan-based reference to &quot;Bryan ADams fan&quot;), this is a great collection of tunes - plus a stellar new one! Basically a &quot;Best of Bryan&quot; part 2 album, with part 1 being &quot;So Far So Good.&quot; The bulk of the album is music from his 90's work, as opposed to the primarily 80s-driven &quot;So Far So Good.&quot; Three of Bryan's four #1 hits are here, including the timeless &quot;Everything I Do (I Do It For You)&quot; ballad from Robin Hood, the hot latin ballad &quot;Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman,&quot; and the spectacular collaborative piece by Bryan, Sting, and Rod Stewart &quot;All For Love&quot; from the Three Musketeers Soundtrack (his other #1 hit was &quot;Heaven,&quot; which you can find on the &quot;So Far So Good&quot; CD!). Other top hits and well-known tunes are &quot;Can't Stop This Thing We Started,&quot; &quot;Let's Make A Night To Remember,&quot; and &quot;Please Forgive Me.&quot; The classic and always-popular &quot;Summer of 69&quot; is here, too, although it's a little out of place given the 'second half' angle of Bryan's career on this CD. The lead-off track, &quot;Best of Me&quot; is a brand new single and a solid turn-out from Bryan, letting his fans know he's still got what it takes to write, sing, and play great music. If you're a fan, you've clearly got to own this - I believe it's the first time the hard-to-find &quot;All For Love&quot; has appeared on a Bryan Adams CD; &quot;I'm Ready&quot; is a live recording, and the little-known &quot;Back to You&quot; is also a lively live rendition. All in all, a thoroughly solid album and worthy companion piece to &quot;So Far So Good&quot; - if you're new to Bryan's music, pick up both of them today... you'll get no better introduction to one of the legends of the genre, and one of my personal favorites to boot.
6301966562|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining and original movies ever made.  A smart script, wonderful performances and a great soundtrack.<br />WHERE IS THE DVD ALREADY????<br />It REALLY bums me out that we live in a world where you can get drivel like 'Dude, Where's My Car' on DVD, but NOT this gem....
B00003CX5P|4.0|I first saw Phantom Menace about two weeks after it hit the box office. I had already heard all of the negative criticism. Time Magazine defamed the film as a &quot;Big Disappointment&quot;: Targeting, especially, the young, untalented Anakin Skywalker for his poor delivery, and (I quote) &quot;Plain old bad acting&quot;. It is a film that finnatics desperately wanted to take seriously. It was possibly the most anticipated feature of our time. I ask you, &quot;What film could measure up to that kind of hype?&quot;<br />I admit, the movie wasn't perfect, but after walking out of that theatre, I remember wondering what the hell those critics had been talking about. Phantom Menace engages viewrs head on, from the opening scene, right up until the ominous, forbrooding, ending. It maintains a delicate equipoise of fantastical, thought provolking Political interactions, and over the top high speed action. Liam Niesson, and Ewan McGregor play convincing off eachother, in their respective roles, as Jedi master and apprentice. As a devout fan of the original trilogy, I was not disappointed at all.<br />Ok, that said, I will agree that this movie went overboard with some irratating instances of comic relief. Jar-Jar Binks deserves every negative bit of criticism he got. But even more annoying, was the unessecary incorpoartion of old characters into the story. What was the point of having C3PO, and R2D2 in the film? They had no consequence to the plot. They fell exasperingly short of funny, and the film was already annoying enough with Jar-Jar. The actor who played young Anakin really was cheesey, and totally ruined certain, potentially powerful scenes. Natalie Portman's coherced monotone also gets pretty darn annoying after 2 hours.<br />But, I am a fair critic. The faults were not overwhelming enough to warrant all the negative criticism, generated by obsessed fans. I didn't want the film to end. Maybe its because I entered Phantom Menace with some very low expectations, butI left being very pleasantly surprised. It acoplished its obejective: To set the stage.
0064471837|2.0|This is a story about a girl whose father is a famous necromancer, but not of the normal kind. While all of the other necromancers *raise* the dead, he puts them to rest. Then one night Sabriel discovers that her father is trapped in Death (which is an actual place in this story) and she sets out to find him, and also discovers that she must fight a very evil Dead known as `Kerrigor'.<br />My opinion of this book might be a bit biased by the fact that I am growing tired of the same plot used in so many books. If you have a heroine and a hero, then there is no avoiding it, they must fall deeply in love. And naturally it's *true* love! I find it extremely tedious and predictable and it bored me to death. And to make things even worse the hero is of royal blood. What is the fixation with princes and princesses?<br />Besides that I was also bored with the entire way it was written. I dutifully read the first oh 50 pages or so, but then I skimmed the rest. And when I say I skimmed it, I mean that I flicked very fast through the pages and only read a word on each second page, and if something caught my eye I would go back and read perhaps a passage or<br />two. I wasn't even interested in the ending. The good guys smite the bad guy and tell each other how much they love each other. And then Nix throws in a few deaths among the good guys who aren't main characters, just to make it sound more real.<br />I am not impressed, and I do NOT recommend this book whatsoever. I only gave it 2 stars because I think it might have pontentials (or could have), and while it's not interesting to me, I deem it able to please other people (knowing the other horrible books that have somehow managed to get themselves published I do not doubt that there are people who can be entertained by anything).
B000059XUO|2.0|This is a PG-13 movie for 11-year-old Saturday morning cartoon fans trying to convince you it's really an R-rated adult fantasy epic.  This is my favorite sort of movie, so I'm not prematurely indisposed to a lot of grimness, fighting, gothic sets, etc.; but the look of this movie (admittedly its strongest selling point) is, with a few exceptions, flat.  All the Gothic churches and bars that Brandon Lee runs around in come off looking like photographs instead of the lush, dark alleyways and skyscrapers they're meant to resemble.  There's hardly any dimension to the images on the screen; it's all on the surface, which is exactly opposite of the intended effect.  Brandon Lee is an OK actor - he speaks well, but doesn't always communicate skillfully with his face (there are a couple times when, instead of showing the agony he's supposed to be in, he just looks dreamy); he also hardly does any martial arts, which I considered a big disappointment.  The script [stinks], e.g., \\"I see you've made your decision.\\"  The swearing has absolutely no rhythm - nobody swears in real life like these guys do; when you're using four letter words to vent your feelings, you can often find a kind of rhythm without even trying - unlike these characters.  It's as if they threw in a lot of obscenity just to try to make you think these are genuinely tough guys (instead of idiots who swallow bullets and shout \\"Fire it up\\" to each otherw while pumping their fists - gimme a break, not even junior highers do that).  The only other element I remember was a lot of agony from the main character, repeating the mistake which almost all anime and most actions movies make: in a movie like this, you don't want pathos - you just wanna see stuff blown up real good and a lot of fighting.   This movie could have been a lot worse; but it's not a good sign when, about halfway through, I found myself thinking, \\"Gee, this would make a great comic book . . .\\"
B00003003R|5.0|Axl does sound kind of deep and growly in places, but it's all part of the experience. If you're a fan, it'll add to your collection. This album provides a unique perspective of what it would be like to be at the world's best GNR concert. For those of us who haven't had the privilege, the only alternative is this, and even if you already have all the other albums, it's worth buying. Think of it this way: You'll get alternate versions of 22 of GNR's songs.<br />It's also good for the bits that aren't recorded in the studio. The bits that Axl says in between songs and to control the crowd, for example. Sure all of the songs are live, but that's half the fun - the moment when the crowd collectively recognises a song and cheers!<br />I actually think a few of the songs sound better live, such as \\"Don't Cry\\" and \\"Dust N' Bones\\". And the way Axl starts \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" sure is pretty cool. You also get a song \\"It's alright\\" originally by someone else, but still well done.<br />Axl does wonderful things with this live version of \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\", it is excellent because of the audience participation. You can tell that Axl has some fun with it too.<br />\\"Estranged\\" is strange, not as otherworldly as the original, but still very listenable. If only for the bit where Axl says: \\"Ladies and Gentlemen, on the keyboards, Mr Dizzy Reed\\" and the crowd cheers, and the song continues.<br />But a few tracks, however, sound much, much worse, such as \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\", which is possibly the worst recording ever of that particular song.<br />I got all the exact same MP3's of all the songs contained on both of these CDs for FREE from napster (when It was around), and I enjoyed them all THAT much, I went out and bought this double-album anyway (and then deleted the files) because I thought (and still think) GNR deserved not to be ripped off. No it doesn't include \\"Civil War\\" or \\"Coma\\", but great stuff nonetheless. Note that I only review things that are worth reviewing
B00005JKCF|5.0|I went into Spiderman with high expectations for a movie on one of my 2 favorite super heros, directed by one of my favorite directors. I can happily say that I was not let down. This movie blew my expectations away. Toby Maguire is a perfect adolescent Peter Parker; Kirsten Dunst is beautiful, and does a pretty good job playing Mary Jane Watson; and Willem Dafoe is outstanding as the Green Goblin. Casting was outstanding. The costumes, unlike those of the X-Men, look like they were torn straight from the comic-book pages. Everything is presented in Sam Rami's (Evil Dead trilogy, Darkman, and Xena television series) wonderfully campy style without going overboard and becoming stupid slapstick mush. Also, fans of the Evil Dead trilogy should be pleased to know that Rami has lots of Evil Dead cameos in Spiderman, Ash's car makes an appearance, as does Bruce Campbell <br />Personally,I feel Spiderman rises above my other favorite superhero movie: Tim Burton's 1989 Batman. Star Wars Episode II definitely has its work cut out for it, and I don't think there is much chance that the modernized Star Wars will be able to one-up the Wall-crawler. All in all, don't wait for this to come out on DVD. see it on the biggest screen possible. As for me, I'm checking it out on the giant IMAX screen this weekend.
B000000OQF|4.0|This is the album that really started it all. To me, all the tracks on here spell out pretty much the same word: \\"bad\\". No not the songs - the attitude. They do some wonderful things with the guitar, all echoey and resonating, I don't know how they get it to sound like that in some places, but then, I don't know one end of a guitar from the other! I know enough to know that probably no-one but Slash can play like this. Just listen to the intro to \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\", \\"Nightrain\\", \\"Paradise City\\" and \\"Rocket Queen\\", and you'll hear what I'm writing about. All the unlawful little youngsters out there will no doubt also love \\"Out Ta Get Me\\".<br />And who could forget \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\", one of the more mature songs contained within? Therein, Slash provides some of the more memorable solo tunes. Everyone, and I mean everyone, just totally loves the intro guitar to that one.<br />Although I'm a HUGE fan, it's not my favourite GNR album. I'd sum it up as dated, but, in places, still pretty awesome.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I really don't feel like writing a dissertation at this very moment. Just wanted to add another 5-star rating to this CD.
B000000OQY|4.0|This is Guns N' Roses first true album. It isn't as refined as some of their more recent songs from the Use your Illusion set. These just seem so much more raw, and you can tell that the band has grown since they did this. I think everyone will agree that the best track on here is \\"Patience\\", but I don't like the ending much.<br />Keep in mind that it is a VERY short album (only 34 minutes). There are some other good songs on here that probably only fans will appreciate. \\"Move to the City\\" and \\"Mama Kin\\" both, how should I say, just flow along very nicely, and are both good in their own juvenile sort of way. Just listen to the bit in \\"Mama Kin\\" that says: \\"I've been dreamin', floatin' down stream n' losin' touch with all that's real\\". That just flows so well. They also do a great extended-live version of \\"Move to the City\\" on GNR's Live Era album, in case you weren't aware.<br />The only other controversial track worth mentioning on here is \\"One in a Million\\". I like it. Although if you are an immigrant, a homosexual, a black or a Police officer, you'll most likely be offended, so stay away. I think it is a very honest song, and let's face it: we can all sometimes get frustrated with other ethnic groups or races. Axl doesn't necessarily say anything all that bad per se - it is just that comments are aimed not at just anybody- but at certain groups in particular. Well that is what racism is, I guess. Regardless, I still think it has something. For instance, Axl says: \\"Maybe a grey-hound could be my way\\". Now isn't that a marvelous way of saying he's going down to the race-track to bet on a greyhound? If you don't have both Use Your Illusion albums yet, then get those, because at nearly 80 minutes each, they're better value for money.
0783229526|5.0|Those are the final words of Hunter S. Thompson's masterpiece non-fiction/fiction novel which blew minds when it first hit the presses in the pages of Rolling Stone magazine in 1971, and continues to do so to this very day.  The film version does NOT end with those words, but I feel that those words sum it up quite well.    This film is an amazing adaptation of that indispensable piece of American literature...quite possibly the best book-to-film adaptation I have ever seen.  The events depicted in the film, though sometimes scrambled about for the sake of fluidity (if it can be called that), were all taken directly from the book (except for the CHP trooper asking Thompson for a kiss...that wasn't in the book), and most of the voice-over monologues and character dialogue are taken verbatim.  Of course, several elements from the book were left out, but what can you expect in a two-hour film?  This is a lavish, utterly faithful adaptation of Thompson's book with incredible performances.    Johnny Depp's performance is dead-on to the point of being absolutely frightening.  True, he's a bit too short, but who cares?  In appearance, mannerism, expression, voice, and charisma, Johnny Depp may as well BE Hunter Thompson (or Raoul Duke, if you will).  Depp had met Hunter and spent a night at his ranch prior to being contracted to play the part.  In fact, it was Thompson who suggested that he do the film.  He spent four months at Thompson's ranch, eventually leaving with Hunter's car and his clothes (many of which hadn't been washed in 30 years)...and apparently, he also left with Hunter's mind...or, at least, enough of it to virtually BECOME him onscreen.    Benicio del Toro is also fantastic in this film, having gained some 45 pounds in 10 weeks in order to play Thompson's Chicano lawyer friend, Oscar Acosta.  These two play their parts for everything they're worth and the end result is astounding.    It is my theory that anyone who has seen this film and didn't like it has never read the book.  Why?  Because if you've read the book and loved it, you will love this movie.  And if you've read the book and hated it, you wouldn't bother WATCHING this movie in the first place...would you?    So the bottom line is that if you've read Hunter Thompson's seminal masterwork and adored it, as I did, you will not be disappointed by this film adaptation...it delivers the goods in a way that very few film adaptations can.  Truly, it seems inconceivable that a work like \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" could translate so well to the screen...but somehow, it does.    It's interesting to note that most of the reviews here give the film a 4 or 5 star rating...with a few 1 star ratings here and there. Also interesting to note that almost every person who gave the film 1 star seems to have no idea that it was ever a book, or that it's based on a true story. Out of the 100 or so reviews I read, I found only 1 negative review that mentioned the book. These people don't even know that HST really exists...otherwise, why would they all complain that Johnny Depp's acting is \\"horrible,\\" or \\"the worst acting of his career\\" when, in fact, his performance as HST is flawless?    If you haven't read Thompson's book, you might still get something from this film (a few laughs, at the very least), but if you feel lost at the end, you might want to give the book a read and then come back to the film...it will make more sense once you get the full story.  Of course, it will never make complete sense.  I mean, good God, man...what does?

0312954468|5.0|Just finished the 3rd in the series (Warlock) and still can't get enough.  This book takes about 100 pages to get going but then Smith never looks back.<br />This is the first of Smith's works I read and didn't know what to expect.  Definitely a page turner, especially if you like history (albeit fiction..?).<br />Go ahead and read 7th scroll.  You won't miss anything if you skip it, and the paperback's only a few bucks...then get Warlock!
6305121451|2.0|I was extremely disapointed with this film, which I call \\"Iguanus, Monster From the Deep\\" since the title \\"Godzilla\\" does not belong.  The film-makers did a diservice to the rest of the Godzilla films.    With the older Godzilla filme you expected so-so effects and an unusual plot.  This film had some decent effects but a plot borrowed (ie. stolen) from many good sci-fi films, from Alien to Jurasic Park to the King Kong ending.  The acting was marginal at best.  The acting in the original film was much better.  Also the creature did not act like the true Godzilla.  The Godzilla I know and love would never run from the Army but would trash the entire city without so much as a thought.  The ending was so pathetically week that I nearly laughed out loud in the theater.  The only part of the film I truly enjoyed was when \\"Iguanus\\" jumped over some military vehicles and into the river.  A very cool scene.  But, on the whole, a film that does not deserve the \\"Godzilla\\" title.  If you want to see a good Godzilla film watch any of the 90's Godzilla films.  The effects are a vast improvement over the old films, and Godzilla himself looks positively menacing.  A true monster to stay away from.
B000065U1N|5.0|Black Hawk down is one of the best war movies ever made.  There are several reasons for this. 1.  The acting is first class.  Each actor, be it delta force or rangers, went through condensed training camps before filming the movie.  2.  Realism.  This is as real as it gets without actually being there.  3.  Accuracy.  Black Hawk Down is historically accurate.  4.  Directing.  Ridely Scott contended for an Oscar, he could have won, but the academy doesn't like giving the oscars to war flicks.  5.  Cinematography, sound.  I think the oscars speek for themselves.  This is a must see movie for all Americans.  It depicts a battle not well known to the public.  It also shows the common citizen what Special Operations Forces do to protect the United States and preserve our freedom.
B00003CX5P|3.0|The first time I saw a preview for this movie, I was extremely psyched.  The pod race, the double-bladed lightsaber, and the subtitles, which stirred up many emotions in me.  I couldn't wait to see this movie.  Then I did.  I must say this: I liked it.  I definitely do not have the same respect for this one as I do for the original trilogy, but I liked it.  Although I did think that Jake Lloyd could have acted better, and that Jar Jar was a little exuberant.  Anyway, years before the time of the Empire, there was the Old Republic.  Each intelligent species would have a Senator on Coruscant, the capitol planet, later featured as Leia and Han's home when they become leaders of the New Republic.  The Trade Federation have decided to blockade a small peaceful planet, but their intentions are unknown.  We soon learn that they are not behind it, but a Sith Lord named Darth Sidious.  The Sith were a group of Jedis who used their power for evil, but they eventually killed themselves.  Now, there are only two left: Darth Sidious and his apprentice, Darth Maul.  The Supreme Chancellor of the Senate dispatches two Jedi to help the planet Naboo in this ordeal, but when they rescue the Queen, they are forced to land on Tatooine, a desert planet.  They are stranded, and their only hope is a young boy named Anakin Skywalker.  He wins money for them in a race, and they are able to leave, but Qui-Gon Ginn decides to take Anakin with them because he believes that he has great potential to become a Jedi.  When they get to Coruscant, the Senator from Naboo, Palpatine (the future Emporor), informs them that the Chancellor will be unable to help them, and suggests that the Queen rally that the election for Chancellor be moved up.  When everyone gets back to Naboo, they all learn how to stop the Trade Federation, and each person has a different role.  The two Jedi get sidetracked, and must duel with Darth Maul.  For the most part, this movie was good, but it was more of a kid's movie thanthe others.  Rest assured, Episode II will return to the old format.  Also, as I said, Jar Jar and Jake Lloyd were the two biggest faults, and also, there is a scene where the Queen reveals a secret about her identity, and she could have waited for a more intense moment to tell everyone.  But I still liked it, and I plan on seeing the next two, which will be more like the originals.
0385335482|5.0|This is a light hearted book that is just silly and entertaining. I would highly recommend both this book and it's sequel. Keeping my fingers crossed for #3!
B0000062GE|5.0|This album, is most deffinantly my favourite album of all time.<BR>I have had it for 3 or 4 years now. This cd never ceases to amaze me. More work has been put into this cd than all of the other albums for sure. The new album is great, but, it doesn't have that 'moving' feeling that it gives you, with this album. Sometimes I just lay with my gf listening to this album, holding each other close, and it makes me really happy. It just, helps my life go by day by day. How? Because every day that I listen to this album, it puts a smile on my face for the rest of the day. I have no idea how to explain this and make myself sound all professional like most of the others, lol. But, this cd is a very emotional cd. It brings out the love in people, and makes puts a tear in peoples eyes. I most DEFINANTLY recomend this to ANYONE.
B000002J1I|5.0|I got Tormato at the mall 2 years back, and I live for this album. Relayer was the album of my choice, but when I heard \\"Rejoice\\", I scratched my head. This album is very weird. Not because of the UFO themes, simply because the song structures arent typical to Yes. Its actually VERY far from Going for the One. <BR>Furture Times Rejoice is a very neat song, and the snare drum sounds great during the verse. I paid very close attention to the sound quality, and it is a one of a kind. The drums sound very open, and the bass -with that godamn filter pedal sounds like a bloody MiniMoog! Love it. <BR>The next three songs are good too. Just like all of this album...but the weird mixture between the Polymoog and Steves twangy tube sounding guitar may be what turns most people off from this disc. The next two songs are good...but it took me a good month to really like Circus of Heaven...but now, that damn song speaks to me! And finally, the next two songs just kick ... Onward is a pretty little song-and if you pay close attention to the french horn (or flugelhorn?) its will amaze you. On the silent wings of freedom is a really good song too. This might be a prime example of that great bass tone I mentioned. I cant really explain this album to be honest. Its just a different album....and for some reason, i always think of the color pink when I hear ANY song from it. Each song has this certain thing that makes it nightmarish. <BR>P.S. Best recorded Yes album. (soundquality-wise)
B00005JKCF|2.0|While I am sure this review is likely to earn flames from fans all around, I cannot help but be the thorn between the multitude of roses.  I will give the movie its due insofar as that the special effects, cinematography, and sound score were enjoyable.<br />Unfortunately, for me it ended there.  The story line was designed to make people happy.  It served its purpose it seems (given the reviews), yet it is apparent that people do not stop to think how absurd the writing is.  You have young Peter Parker who knows all about the most complicated of microscopes and claims expertise on the various species of arachnids.  Yet...he hopes one day to make it to college...maybe by being a photographer for a newspaper (because there is no way he would get a scholorship with that knowledge?)  <br />Then one can settle into the warm feelings one gets as the romantic heronie (spoiler) confesses that as her life is in imminent danger...she thinks that she may never get to see her true love (is anyone else thinking...gee my life is in danger...what do I do?)  I understand it followed the comic closely, to which I am sure fans are appreciative.  So kudos for loyalty to the comic, special effects, and sound score, yet the writing gets a major yawn.
0066620996|5.0|I would recommend this book highly to anyone running an organization or advising those that do.  Collins breaks down a complex business world into very simple, clear concepts.  Many of the conclusions reached by Collins are contrary to popular belief about leadership, and approach to strategy.<br />Finally a guru, who's starts with a focus on companies with phenomenal results, then works to identify the causes, rather than trying to make a case that attempts to prove a pre-determined hypothesis.

B00005U4UV|3.0|One cannot help but notice, on a rare sabbatical from curing cancer and working for world peace, that there are no exterior scenes in which actors appear in this piquant examination of professional ethics in the medical establishment that makes 'ER' look like, well, 'ER'. The back stabbing in question ceasing to be a metaphor at one point. Just thought I'd mention it, though. No dancing around the Dahlias then, just corpses. <BR>Allegedly funny, this modest genre outing proves nothing less than the pornography of violence, the sadism of which precludes any real fun. Did I say fun? There must be a reason why it has engendered so many repeat viewings and that can only be due to the performance of Jeff Combs, although the rest of the cast is strong. Combs manages to introduce elements of a walking cartoon into his performance without losing focus and realism. It's quite a turn. Having found his niche, Mr Combs has continued to work mostly outside the mainstream of movie production where he has no doubt progressed from playing the unhinged Mr West to characters without any window frame at all. I have only seen three of his oeuvre, so I cannot testify to the accuracy of this statement but should the situation change I expect uncanny prescience to be the order of the day.<BR>Nice touch when a character actually collapses from shock, an affliction that curiously escaped the beleagered Ash in 'The Evil Dead' in which he suffered considerably worse without the employ (however Dionysian) of a side kick.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones's debut album &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; is an excellent example of great melody writing with harmonies and changes that are accessible to the average music listener. Her opening track is a prime example of her compositional skills, in addition to the accompaniment provided by the other musicians. Some of the best musical pairings occur on this album and the combination of Norah's singing and piano work with Bill Frisell's Guitar playing will definately stand the test of time. One of the most outstanding cuts on the album is the song &quot;Nightingale.&quot; <BR>Reviewed by - S. Penderel, Faculty Music Ed., UofM, A2
B00000K0E5|4.0|this was an absolute turn around for James Bond, my favourite movie series of all time. Timothy Dalton was nothing, it wasn't the same with him. He was just some normal character, now, it's Peirce Brosnan who changes the whole Bond around, the best Bond yet. This movie was better than Tomorrow Never Dies, but I liked The World Is Not Enough the best, I still love that movie. AT parts of this movie, it's a bit dull, but who cares, it's James Bond. In this one, James Bond is after a traitor named General Ouromov, his good friend, who betrays him Trevelyan, and he meets a girl named Natalya, who knows a computer guy named Boris, who's also a traitor. Then, there's Mishkin, who thinks Bond is guilty for all the bombing. And there's Valintin, who doesn't know what to think, and doesn't treat Bond to good in this one, definetly not as good as in The World Is Not Enough. This is a definite turn around for Bond. Roger Moore was good, but not like Pierce Brosnan, they're both the same characters, put Brosnan's better and newer. Sean Connery was a good Bond as well, but not like Moore or Brosnan. Dalton was by far the worst, it's not Bond with him, ... . It's just your average movie with him. This movie, on the other hand was great!!! SEE it!!!
B00003CXE6|5.0|When I saw Gladiator for the first time, I was instantly drawn into the story.  The very first scene, where we see Maximus dreaming of his home, then gazing at a bird fluttering away, shows us a lot of his dual personality.  He instantly turns deadly serious and faces battle with courage, and even a touch of humor as a smile crosses his face when he almost takes out one of his own men.  The battle scenes are gritty, but still manage to convey a sense of heroism.  Hans Zimmer's score is wonderfully appropriate (how did it not win Best Score?), and the inclusion of Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus was a stoke of genius by the casting crew.  This film will amaze you if you haven't seen it yet, and will continue to if you already have!  SEE IT!!!!
0395177111|5.0|The Hobbit was a very exciting book. It had wierd and interesting creatures that were unique and not your average fairytale copycats. The story brings the characters to life with very descriptive words. It makes the reader feel as if he/she is traveling and starving and tired and scared along with the rest of the characters. <BR>  Gandalf, the wizard, is my favorite character. He always seems to know what's going on, even when he isn't around. He is smart and clever and can solve just about any problem with his magic or his wits. Sometimes he tricks people in a harmless and friendly way. He makes friends with a lot of the different characters you meet throughout the novel. He has many friends of all races (which is unusal for the story) such as dwarves, hobbits, elves and even special magic friends that can be more than one species of animals <BR>  This is very interesting book. It is fun and exciting and paints wonderful adventures in my head. It is so good that I can't wait to begin Tolkien's other books.   If J.R.R Tolkien's other books are as exciting and interesting as this one I think he should be considered one of the best authors of our time.
0783113943|5.0|I first saw this movie when it was released a number of years ago on HBO. It was, and still is, one of my top five favorite movies. I am awed by how the life of Gia was presented; visceral certainly, and honest without worrying about how it would affect the audience. In this role, Ms. Jolie charms, appalls, seduces and touches...you run the gamut of emotions as you see this young woman struggle with life, and finally lose it.

0380789035|3.0|I really like Neil Gaiman. However, I think he was trying too hard to write a Big Literary Novel with this one, and lost some of his usual touch of enchantment along the way.<br />Mostly, this is a depressing novel. The humans are jerks to each other, the gods are jerks to the humans and to each other. I won't summarize the plot, since the editorial review covers that. I'll just say that this book, while well-written and occasionally funny, is essentially made up of gloom-n-doom punctuated by cruelty and violence. I read chapter after chapter of misery, and then reached the anticlimactic ending.<br />In addition, the gods don't, for the most part, seem very *magical*.  That seems to be the point--they've been reduced to almost human lows--but I guess I expected more mystery and magic out of a story about the wars among the gods.<br />Zorya Vechernaya, the lady of the Evening Star, is an exception--her character just oozes the mystery lacking in many of the others.  Another good touch is the small town in which Shadow lives during the story; its surface placidity and dark secrets are wonderfully done.<br />Overall, though, this is a very well-written book, but leaves you with a very \\"down\\" feeling.

0380789035|4.0|Neil Gaiman's AMERICAN GODS is a first-rate yarn, a tall tale in the tradition of the best American mythology.  It is a paradoxical, creative journey of revelation and self-discovery.<br />AMERICAN GODS' main character, Shadow, is swept into a conflict raging between gods who moved to America with their worshippers and were promptly forgotten.  Apparently, gods do not do well in America, finding it difficult to inspire worship and sacrifice in a land so diverse and filled with such rich blessings and horrible curses.  As Shadow interacts with the gods, he travels the country and deals with his own past, his dead-yet-walking wife, and future prospects that seem uncertain at best.<br />If this were, as some have suggested, an exercise of an over-active imagination, I would have been much less appreciative of this novel.  However, the wandering storyline of this novel was, for me, one of its most appealing aspects.  As Shadow is a rambler, so is this story - the best American mythology does the same, moving about this vast country and discovering riches in the most unlikely places.<br />I think that, rather than being unfocused, AMERICAN GODS is in fact a reflection of America as seen from an outsider's viewpoint (Gaiman is British-born).  As the center of the story begins to shift (and that shift is one of the most unexpected pleasures of the book), readers will, I believe, appreciate Gaiman's gifts as a writer: seamless integration of research into interesting plotlines, with vibrant character development to boot.<br />A word to readers:  THIS IS NOT REALLY FANTASY/SCIENCE FICTION.  At least, it is not F/SF in the vein of Asimov or the Pern series, where technology or fantasy drive the story.  AMERICAN GODS is, in my opinion, fiction, plain and simple, with some elements of F/SF thrown in.  I would compare it to the works of Orson Scott Card or Ray Bradbury's longer stories and novels.<br />Neil Gaiman, I think, will continue to be a major voice in literature, if AMERICAN GODS is any indication of the quality of his writing and his creative vision.if AMERICAN GODS is any indication of the quality of his writing and his creative vision.

B00004X0ER|4.0|Isn't refreshing to hear music not associated with pop.  That's what I consider this album.  Refreshing.  It reminds you of years gone by.  That is because it sounds like others, as has been pointed out.  Is that bad? No.  It's like listening to the &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; soundtrack thinking new classic Bowie music had been created.  It just makes you happy.
038533558X|4.0|I became a Coben fan after reading &quot;Tell No One&quot;. So &quot;TNO&quot; is my benchmark for greatness because I was hooked from chapter one and each subsequent chapter just added to the mystery.  With &quot;Gone for Good&quot; the first chapter reveals the first twist but it then takes several chapters to develop characters and lay the groundwork for the 2nd half of the book but once it takes off, twists-a-plenty. Coben writes books that are easy to read, full of twists, emotion, and excitement.  &quot;Gone for Good&quot; lives up to what I was expecting but didn't quit reach the peak of &quot;Tell No One&quot; in my opinion. I still finished the book in just two days because I couldn't put it down.  Look for &quot;Gone for Good&quot; on the next list of Edgar Award nominees.  I also recommend the Myron Bolitor series by Coben as well.
B000021XS0|3.0|I am a [stinker] for two things (well, 2 things that are relevant to this review): concept albums and clever self-referencing in TV and movies. (I still talk about that whole Bob Newhart dream thing like I saw it yesterday.) With this album, both guilty pleasures are fully indulged. It is a concept album of grand scale -- over 70 minutes of music, making the listener feel as if he is seated at the Rock and Roll opera house with James LaBrie as the \\"Phantom\\" for the night, all centered around a storyline that began in the early '90's with their second album, Images and Words. Which is why they sporadically throw in musical motifs that \\"flash back\\" to the original \\"Metropolis Part 1.\\" The Overture to the piece, in fact, begins with the same keyboard theme as the original. Dream Theater manage to do this just often enough, making the listener feel like they were hearing a favorite old song at a concert performance, but don't beat you over the head with it in an overly self-conscious way. <BR> That said, I also have 2 musical pet peeves: lame lyrics, and imitation disguised as \\"influence.\\" Those who know Dream Theater know that while they are musical Gods among men, their lyrics have always been something to keep their records from being prog-rock Joe Satriani albums. To be fair, James LaBrie's voice is as strong as ever, and they continue to have a decent number of memorable vocal melodies. But \\"Where do we come from?/ Why are we here?/ Where do we go when we die?\\" could have been written by me for my high school literary magazine when I was 16 (and I'm not so sure it would have made the final edition). <BR> Another thing I'd have done when I was 16 was write a song exactly like one of my favorite bands, and think I was awsome because it sounded just like them. And not to harp on this particular track, but \\"The Spirit Carries On\\" is the most blatant rip-off of Pink Floyd I've ever heard. LaBrie literally IMPERSONATES Roger Waters, with all the baritone breathiness of his mellow numbers from The Wall and The Final Cut. Make no mistake about this, I absolutely love Dream Theater as a rule. But with all the originality they normally showcase, couldn't he just be mellow James LaBrie from a gem like \\"Hollow Years\\"?<BR> So therein lies the 2-edged sword that is this record. The playing is some of the most incredible stuff I've ever heard on record and makes Mahavishnu Orchestra sound like Green Day. How Mike Portnoy does the sommersaults he does and still rocks is beyond me, John Petrucci is flawless, and there is a bass solo by John Myung that would make Cliff Burton rise up in his grave, pump his fist, and go \\"YEEEAHHH!!!...But at the same time, as incredible a feat as \\"The Dance of Eternity\\" is, it's also kind of...well, boring. Not the lightning fast runs or the whiplash time changes, but just the sheer volume of them, and how it feels like the song could have been called \\"Kitchen Sink.\\" When a band like Rush played in 13/8 time, they repeated it in a way that you could keep up, and used a basic theme to hold it together, and it was a song called \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" that was longer than this song, but feels much shorter. But in some of their stretches, Dream Theater seem like they're just jamming away without a final destination -- unlike previous outings like \\"A Change of Seasons\\", one of the best 20+ minutes of prog-rock ever. <BR> Scene Six, a song called \\"Home\\", is worth the price of the CD alone. There is a Rage Against the Machine-worthy build-up from near-silence to one of the most [rear]-kicking wah-wah riffs Dream Theater has ever come up with. I easily drive 20 mph over the speed limit when I hear it, and hit my head on the steering wheel. On purpose. But as is the trend with this record, the riff sounds oddly familiar. It is basically a musical anagram of Tool's \\"Forty-Six and Two.\\"<BR> To paraphrase Whitney Houston, I will always love Dream Theater. But if you are interested in picking up an album of theirs to get introduced, this one is harder to swallow than many. Awake, A Change of Seasons, and Falling Into Infinity are more successful at the difficult task of making prog challenging, original, rocking, and memorable.
B000002LHX|4.0|Maybe Prince should hire himself out for soundtracks.  In a commercial soundtrack, there are external pressures to keep the songs short and listenable, two positive traits absent from Prince's music since &quot;The Gold Experience.&quot;  Without these influences, Prince tends to submit these massive, multi-disc monstrosities containing 10-minute songs with nonsensical lyrics and gooey, grating melodies.<br />Anyone who has bought one of these later albums (&quot;Emancipation,&quot; &quot;Crystal Ball,&quot; etc.) will appreciate the discipline apparently enforced by the conventions of a movie soundtrack.  Instead of the rambling tunes that have marked Prince's later work, you get the tight, driven funk of &quot;The Future.&quot;  And instead of whatever he was doing on &quot;Emancipation,&quot; you get the clever lyricism of &quot;Electric Chair,&quot; and &quot;Lemon Crush.&quot;  The best song on the album, &quot;Vicki Waiting,&quot; manages to capture a bachelor's conflict between the desire for a long-term relationship and the fear of commitment better than any other song I've ever heard.  Even &quot;Batdance,&quot; &quot;Trust,&quot; and &quot;Partyman,&quot; while far from original masterworks, are simply more fun to listen to than nearly anything Prince has done since.<br />All in all, 4 stars for an underrated album.  Here's hoping that, some day, Prince returns to what made this album good.
0790736039|5.0|When I read Stephen King's bestseller 'It' I thought it was his finest work, and this film certainly does it justice.  The story of an evil intelligence which lives under the town of Derry and which emerges to claim victims every so many years is gripping.  The scenes from the past makes you feel you really know the central cast - the is a film about people as much as horror, and the characters are all strong and well-thought-out.  Pennywise is both hilarious and sinister, the real dark side of both the circus and childhood pranks.  Not only one of the best King adaptations, but quite possibly one of the best horror films ever made.
6305232660|5.0|This movie is about how different people react to learning that a comet is headed toward Earth. Mayhem ensues when the citizens find that a computer will preselect 80,000 of them. The people this story focuses on are true heros and heroines, even though some may get unsung. For example: Leo, the boy who discovered the comet, marries his girlfriend in an attempt to allow her and her family to live. When he finds that he must live, while she must die, he goes back to find and try to rescue her. This story is an excellent choice, one that I recommend full heartedly.
B00005YXZH|4.0|for once the hype is right, this cd is great. their subtle use of tape loops and carefully placed electronic sounds make these songs really take off.  they're not trying to hide behind the technology like a lot of lesser bands would and have done, they use it to enhance the music and give it an additional dimension.  there is something so indescribably chilling about the ending of &quot;poor places&quot; where a woman's voice repeats the album's title over and over again on top of a wall of electronic blips and beeps.  every song on this cd is good, there's nothing to skip over, if you like folk music, psychadelic pop or just music in general you should get this cd, you won't be disappointed.
0783240287|1.0|Anyone who saw the stage production of JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR RAINCOAT must be disappointed by the movie. The main problem is the staging of it as a play at a school, resulting in unrealistic and cutesy scenes of kids worshipfully smiling at singing adults. The music is good, but the narrator makes faces, and Danny Osmond with long hair and half-shaven looks like he just woke up from sleeping on the street. My advice if you have this video is to close your eyes, and just listen to the music.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I have been a huge incubus fan for awhile, and Morning View is stuck in my CD player.  I saw them live last night and it was unbelievable!!! they have an awesome show with AMAZING lights and even better sound.  Then.... brandon took off his shirt, and every girl in the audience went INSANE!!! even if you don't like his looks, you can't deny the sound.  buy this album, ...
B00005YXZH|5.0|Wilco has most certainly gotten better since the first two albums &quot;AM&quot; and &quot;Being There&quot;.  This latest one proves that they can combine country style music with rock and make it sound great!  <br />While this album is not as good as Summerteeth, it comes really close!  The songs I particularly liked alot were &quot;Kamera&quot;, &quot;I am trying to break your heart&quot;, and &quot;War on war&quot;.  Check out the quicktime stuff too if you get the chance!  Can't wait for the next album!
B0000636UN|2.0|If you're like me who admired Sheryl for her tough-girl attitude and great songwriting, spare yourself the agony. Most of the songs will leave you thinking \\"Haven't I heard this song before?\\" (especially \\"Diamond Road\\" and \\"It's So Easy\\") and there's a preponderance of \\"Love-hurts-so-get-drunk-and-cry-in-your-drink\\" kinda songs (ESPECIALLY \\"C'mon C'mon\\" , \\"It's So Easy\\" and \\"Over You\\") that lack both the edge and depth of Crow's previous work. NOW we understand why after this album she decided to take a break from making music. That said, there are still some tracks that are up to her usual standard. I recomend downloading \\"Safe and Sound\\", \\"Lucky Kid\\" and \\"Steve McQueen\\"... proof that while Sheryl may have missed the mark with this album, she's still got what it takes, somewhere in there.
B000001ESP|5.0|...then _Moving Pictures_ is probably it. _Moving Pictures_ is to Rush what _Van Halen 1_ is to Van Halen and what _IV_ is to Led Zeppelin--not necessarily the best albums by these bands, but definitely albums that define the sound of each band and capture each band at a pivotal moment in their careers.<br />Peart's lyrics began to become more personal with _Permanent Waves_, and the trend continues on _Moving Pictures_. \\"Tom Sawyer\\" is a staple of rock radio that never seems to get old. \\"Red Barchetta\\" is an incredibly descriptive account of not only a young man's relationship with his car, but also with his uncle. This is one of the best examples of a progressive rock band writing from the heart and not letting the \\"song\\" get lost within all the bells and whistles of complex time signatures and incredible playing. I can't even imagine what it was like to be in the same room as Lee, Lifeson, and Peart when they came up with the instrumental powerhouse of the album, \\"YYZ.\\" And whereas many bands are always giving their \\"praise\\" and \\"thank-yous\\" to their fans, Rush write their own take on the \\"fame\\" that comes with being in a band. Peart sums up the privacy that the band desires in \\"Limelight\\" when he writes, \\"I can't pretend a stranger is a long-awaited friend.\\" A bold move for a rock band to make. <br />I remember someone once telling me that when he first got _Moving Pictures_ when it came out in 1981, he literally didn't realize it had a second \\"side\\" b/c all he would listen to would be the first four songs. The last three songs on the album indicate where Rush had been, where they were, and where they were going. I sound like Yoda. Anyway, \\"The Camera Eye\\" is the longest, proggiest number on the album, \\"Witch Hunt\\" is restrained, crunching hard rock. And the album's closer, \\"Vital Signs\\" ushers in Rush's desire to move synths to the forefront of their music. All in all, this is the album to get if you're thinking of getting into Rush. If for some reason you arealready into Rush and don't have this album...I can only ask...why?
0553208845|4.0|In the story Siddhartha writen by Hermann Hesse, the main character (Siddhartha) tries to find a way to be happy. He is very smart and talented, yet he never feels good inside. He is often sad and depressed. We believe that when you have an individual who is extremely gifted with insight, he will lead a lonely life. Siddhartha dedicates his whole life to try to find true happiness. Happiness that is pure and true. Yet on this adventure he finds only pain and distress. For he is so intelligent and wise that he tends to over examine things. He takes everything to a completely different level. He feels emotions very strongly and ponders on everything. However even though he does take emotions to the heart it is still hard for him to find and give love. He gives love physically to Kamala but he dose not love mentally till he encounters his son.  All together there are three main scenes that show intelligent and gifted Siddhartha leads a lonely life. Those are the scene where Siddhartha leaves his father to join the Samana. The scene where he leaves Kamala, and the scene where he lets his son go. All the Scenes lead him into the conclusion of the story where he finds what he as been looking for, which is the greatest thing ever. Read this book to find out what that things is.  I give you  my word, you will not be disappointed.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I am terribly sorry for all you people who don't like this film. It is brilliant. I will never tire of seeing it. It is truly atmospheric and makes perfect sense. The &quot;beginning&quot; of the film is actually 2 hours into it, when Diane awakes in her apartment. And yes, the &quot;crux&quot; of the film is in fact Diane's dream. We have all dreamt exactly as Diane did, so how can anyone deny the genius in Mulholland Drive?
B000002AH7|3.0|This certainly will not be one of my favorite jazz plays.  Likely, it stems from its beginning, one of favorites:Concierto De Aranjuez.  I'm afraid that this interpretation just doesn't set well with my ear.<br />The rest of the numbers seem not the best of recording clarity, and lack luster, whatever.  The improv work I'm sure takes great skill and effort, but it's not my kind of sounds.<br />Certainly, others with more jazz exposure than I feel strongly that this is a essential classic, as evidenced by the many reviewers on this site.  I will continue to listen with an open mind, but for right now, this isn't my fav kind of jazz.
0790729369|3.0|I was really disapponted by this movie.  I read the book and fell in love with the story.  I was really excited when I found out is was being made into a movie.  I was so disapponted when I saw it.  The book was a thousand times better.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I was surprized at first,the lack of a true \\"zombie flick\\" story line, but it eventually shows up.Visually, this movie is up to current speed but it just seemed short.The movie itself isn't that scary, rather jumpy in some areas.Resident Evil's action scenes are stunning and accurate(though not in large quantities).Some may be confused because the story doesn't make too much sense.I know alot about RE and some places in the movie just didn't seem to feel right.Well, it was a pretty cool movie.Don't rent it, buy it.[...]
B000002H2H|5.0|This is the greatest collection of music ever written, composed, and executed of all-time. This is the very best \\"music\\", in general, has to offer. At least this is my opinion. My life can be divided into two era's. Before and After I heard \\"Fade to Black\\". The lyrics by James Hetfield are simply the most emotional and passionate feelings ever captured in a musical context. Anyone who has ever felt depressed, lonely, or alienated to such a degree, can identify with this song. It's arguably the greatest song I've ever heard. The album as a whole is Metallica's most raw and powerful effort to date musically as well as lyrically, a little more complex and progressive than their debut, \\"Kill em All\\", and not quite as melodic, classical, and polished as their follow-up, \\"Master of Puppets\\". No other album has been this angry and ferocious. The inro to the first song \\"Fight fir with fire\\", and the album, gives a classical almost surreal mood which suddenly ends after 30 seconds, thus diving into one of the fastest and most brutal riffs ever recorded, on par with anything from Slayer's \\"Reign in Blood\\". the entire album deals with \\"injustice\\" of the most painful and horrific nature. Being executed for a crime you didn't commit, the insanity and brutality of warfare, suicide, etc. \\"Life is mine to live my own way\\". This is the ultimate point of the album. Nobody has more control over your own life than YOU. Each song describes an instance where society has destroyed one's life and mind, until the song \\"Escape\\", which offers a mindset free from the unwanted constraints of society. Every song on this album is great, from start to finish, and should be listened to in it's entirety. If you like Heavy Metal, this is the best ever to come out of the genre. BUY IT!!
0802136834|5.0|I was impressed by the number of theorys on issues throughout this book. The Author does a excellent job of looking at things from different points of veiw. However as with everyone she has her own opinions and tends to lean towards them.Aside from this I highly recommend this book. It was interesting the whole way through and its worth the money to own it so you can read it again and again.
B00005OAIE|5.0|With the exception of some older No Doubt albums, this is the only cd that i can sit through without getting bored. He has a great voice and poignant lyrics that apply really heavily to my generation. He is great.
B000056NX5|2.0|FIRSTLY I HAVE BEEN A DEVOUT FAN OF SUPERSTAR SINCE IT CAME OUT 30 YEARS AGO, IN MY OPIOIN IT IS THE BEST THING WEBBER AND RICE EVER HAVE DONE.  THE MOVIE VERSION BY NORMAN JEWISON IS VERY GOOD BUT I THOUGHT THIS PRODUCTION MIGHT ADD SOMETHING DIFFERENT SINCE IT IS A NEW RELEASE.  I AM A BIT DISSAPOINTED HOWEVER BECUASE IT SEEMS SO DARK AND DISMAL.  THERE IS NO LIGHT IN THE PRODUCTION,THE SET IS DARK AND GREY.  GLEN CARTER GIVES A STRANGE PERFORMANCE,IN MY OPINION,NEVER CONNECTING TO THE FACT HE IS PORTRAYING JESUS,AND VOCALLY NOT ABLE TO GIVE THE UMPH! THE ROLE REQUIRES,YET JUDAS IS VERY GOOD.  MARY IS VERY GOOD, AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE IMMEDIATE CAST EXCEPT PILATE.  PILATE'S DREAM IS GOOD BUT THE OTHER SCENES WITH HIM GO FROM GOOD TO BAD VERY QUICKLY DUE TO OVERACTING AND SCREAMING I AM SURE AT THE DIRECTORS REQUEST.  I COULD NOT WATCH THE END OF THE MOVIE BECUASE I FELT CHEATED.  LISTEN OR WATCH THE ORIGINAL AND NOTE THE PORTRAYAL OF PILATE-IT IS EXCELLENT.  I FELT THE DIRECTOR DID SOME VERY GOOD THINGS IS THIS VERSION BUT FELT HE SCREWED-UP AS MUCH AS HE MADE GOOD.  THIS IS NOT A DARK DISMAL STORY,THERE ARE SEVERAL POINTS OF LIGHT IN IT.  IT IS THE LAST DAYS OF CHRIST THROUGH THE EYES OF JUDAS.  IF YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD THE ORIGINAL OR SEEN THE MOVIE I SUGGEST YOU SHOULD BEFORE BUYING THIS VERSION.
B00005UKKF|4.0|This is where Britney and Las Vegas meet and its a full on show!!!<br />Great stuff, plenty of punch and besides all that, my 2 and a half year old boy loves it!!<br />You won't be disappointed with the show.
B000002UA9|4.0|Despite the short amount of time allowed to create this cd, it turned out great.  Definatly buy it today!
B00003CXZ4|1.0|THis is not about originality. Its about bad taste. Another bad movie featuring Guy Pearce, after the atrocious RAVENOUS. Simply dislike it.
B00005JKCF|5.0|What a charming movie.  Memories of childhood super-hero awe were revived!  I thought this movie had a great balance of action, romance, character-development, and effective dialogue/plot.  There was a wonderful unfolding of innocence blossoming into awareness without the mood ever becoming corny.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Oh, man, this movie has no substance. It´s a fest of special effects spread amongst a group of actors that has no material to work upon (including the poor Jake Lloyd...).<BR>Ok, we have something similar to a plot, but it´s so derivative and inocuous when compared with the classic trilogy, that you just can´t stand it.<br />The atmosphere of the movie has no suspense, no lurking danger, no sense of imminent disaster like the others. IT´s all about trying hard to create a new phenomenal franchise in the style of Star Trek. But all the Star Trek movies at least had a soul of their own.<BR>The PHANTOM MENACE simply has no soul, no matter how hard Lucas and the army of special effects guys must have worked.
B0000042H4|5.0|This is it. Period. I doubt there'll ever be a Ring like this again. Genuine Wagner singers at work, Birgit Nilsson has a voice with a vengeance, Windgassen is great and Hans Hotter may well have been the best Wotan ever. The Vienna Philharmonic is the Vienna Philharmonic, that says it all.  Just put on your headphones or turn up the speaker and go back to the glory days of Wagner performance. Never a dull moment with Solti.
B000063S6Z|5.0|I absolutely loved \\"Play\\" (and still do) despite the fact that it has been overplayed on commercials and various soundtracks. The last year or two, I have been itching for some new Moby material. And finally in 3 years, Moby releases his follow-up to the widely commercial smash known as \\"Play\\" with \\"18\\". It didn't take much for me to fall in love with the first single \\"We Are All Made of Stars\\". The video for the song is pure eye candy with all the celebrities in it. Being a massive Moby fan, I have been waiting for the follow up to the massively successful \\"Play\\". Reminiscent of \\"Play\\" and \\"Everything is Wrong\\", \\"18\\" is a gorgeous landscape of delicate, infectious melodies layered with ambient beats. With every Moby album, I always have my favorite songs but on \\"18\\" I find it extremely difficult to pick a favorite song. All the songs on this album is truly a breathtaking experience to listen to. The title track \\"18\\" is a stunning instrumental that nearly moved me to tears. \\"In This World\\" sounds like it was a leftover track from \\"Play\\". It almost reminds me a bit of \\"Natural Blues\\". Actually \\"18\\" sounds more like \\"Everything is Wrong\\" than \\"Play\\" with the gorgeous, fragile melodies. The only song that I didn't think very highly of was \\"Jam For the Ladies\\". It wasn't bad, just seemed out of place on this intricate album. Probably would have sounded better on \\"Play\\". Actually now that I have given it a listen a few more times, \\"Jame For the Ladies\\" doesn't seem out of place on this album as it did before. Will \\"18\\" be as successful as \\"Play\\"? Probably not but I think longtime Moby fans won't be disappointed with \\"18\\".
0060005424|5.0|Since I find most YA fantasy cheesy and formulaic, I was pleasantly surprised when I read Garth Nix' Sabriel. It was very well written with a colorful and eminently likable cast of characters that populate his imaginary lands of  Ancelstierre and the Old Kingdom.  What a treat for all fans of the genre that Nix' superlative tale of love, loss, and mysterious magic, begun in Sabriel, only gets better in Lirael.  I was captivated from the first sentence of the book.  Nix has, once again, wrought pure magic with his masterful command of the English language.  We are introduced to many skillfully created new characters:  Lirael, the only non - clairvoyant daughter of the Clayr, Sameth and Ellimere, the children of Touchstone and Sabriel, Hedge, an evil necromancer, and a variety of spine - tingling demons, to name a few...  There are also stunning descriptions of the Clayr's Glacier, located in the Old Kingdom, and their most unconventional and surprising library.  It is in  their marvelous library that Lirael, as Third Assisstant Librarian, forgets her troubles and discovers the keys to her destiny - a destiny that is connected to the fate of both the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre.  But, in my opinion, the very best part of Lirael is that it has a cliff - hanger ending.  For the exciting climax to the action begun in Sabriel and continued in Lirael (Who are Mogget and the Disreputable Dog?  What is the Great Charter?), we must wait for the third book in the trilogy, Abhorsen, to be released.  Since I am now convinced that Garth Nix is one of the most gifted writers of our time, I await it's publication eagerly.
B00005QIPH|2.0|Alright, I'll be one of the only people to say the strokes are not that good. I like the same exact music as people who like the strokes (i.e. weezer, radiohead, the shins, built to spill, etc.) but they are really overrated. I will say, for a band being a MTV favorite, they are better than most others chosen by that station, but that is still not saying much. It's decent for a popular group, but don't get fooled by the hype. These guys are not the saviors of rock and roll, and i think with them comes a new term not yet developed &quot;Corporate indie rock&quot;. It doesn't really make sense, but then again.....
0767903862|3.0|I bought the book with the idea of reading it BEFORE our recent trip to Australia this past Christmas.  That didn't happen.  Then I nominated it for our book club to read -that didn't happen!  Finally our book club choose it for a back up and I had to read it.  I enjoyed it more after having been to Australia.  Mr. Bryson's humor is terrific and the places he visited really gave you a true bird's eye view of being or visiting Australia.  The book was wordy and he could have gotten to the point quicker to keep the reader more substained to hold the interest longer.  I  lost interest and find myself putting it down, and then picking it back up.  On the positive side of that, you didn't have to worry about plot, etc. so if you missed something it was no big deal!
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|... I rented this copy and as soon as the Director's Cut Edition comes out I will be hurrying out to purchase it for my own collection. This isn't just a good movie, it's a great movie and I only hope that those who were involved in the making of it weren't deeply pained by the foolishness of the Hollywood critics who had so many rotten things to say about it. Michael Bay and all who were involved did an incredibly tremendous job of putting the viewer right into the battle and into the minds of those who were involved on December 7, 1941. I also loved the story that surrounded the Pearl Harbor sequence. ...These are real people placed in a very real and emotional situation and the actors did a tremendous job of portraying the many, many dimensions of each character. I was especially impressed with Jon Voight's portrayal of FDR. THE CRITICS ARE WRONG! This is a tremendous bit of film making. I have seen many films lately that were a major disappointment to me but this was definitely not one of them!
0679720200|4.0|This book was nuts. This guy was so cold hearted and completly...a strager...even to his friends. He was so cold that it almost even made to this book boring.

B00004XPP0|2.0|A friend of mine clued me into his pet term for the Star wars rerelease films, now reissued on video - the \\"very special\\" editions, as in the \\"very special\\" episodes of sitcoms or \\"very special\\" like Jason Biggs' trumpeteer is perceived to be in \\"American Pie 2\\".   In short, the original Star Wars films were reduced to treacle when, in their rerelease form, they could have garnered a new generation of fans.   <br />Let me qualify something here.  You are not a bigger Star Wars fan than I am, nor do I \\"not get it\\".  I was born in 1975.  My earliest Christmas pictures have me standing next to a Death Star toy with assorted characters and playsets strewn about.  I got Boba Fett, Yoda, and the Emperor in plain, small cardboard boxes via mail order.  I saw Star Wars in rerelease when I was four, saw Empire at the Ziegfield in NY when I was five, and was first in line for both ROTJ and TPM on their opening days.  In-between all that, add in the countless video games, comic collecting, book reading, and whatnot, it all adds up to one thing - I have a deep affection for the Star Wars franchise, but that doesn't mean a slavish devotion to George Lucas' decision-making.  <br />People say Lucas has a right to do whatever he wants with his original trilogy films.  This is incorrect.  Technically, as he owns them, he can do whatever he wishes.  However, especially fourteen years after the fact (1983-1997), the films have a cultural resonance and are beloved for what is in them.  Fundamentally changing them would be like DaVinci adjusting the smile on Mona Lisa's face or Shakespere deciding that Ophelia and Hamlet ride off into the sunset together.  There is a cultural point, that all artists usually have the good sense to recognize, when their art takes on a life of its own and is no longer simply theirs.  <br />George Lucas doesn't seem to get this.  So much of what he does in the Special Editions is strong - the tidying up of effects, the cleaning up of the negative and the sound, and even the addition of some scenes constitute a director's right to go back and try to make his film better.  What Lucas does, though, is go beyond this.  Whether by making Greedo shoot first, Luke scream after tossing himself into the void, adding Jedi Rocks while removing the original song, or even changing the end music and sequence for ROTJ, Lucas has done more than tweak the mechanics and flow of his film.  He has, instead, fundamentally altered our perception of events and of how we process and experence the films.  In short, he has taken something familiar and made it into something cold and alien.  There is no excuse for this.  <br />For a generation of inspired 20 and 30-somethings, along with their parents, Star Wars represented something familiar, something good, and something we wanted to be associated with.  The '97 rerelease, represented here in this collection instead left us feeling unwelcome, as if Lucasfilm decided we had lived out our usefulness and was moving onto a new audience, one that had to have Vader's return to his ship at the end of ESB explained and shown step by step.  Very special, indeed.<br />While there are aspects of the special editions that are good, the negatives far outweigh the positives and it pains me to say that this Star Wars collection is not worth having over the original versions.  You would be better off finding those or getting copies of them than you would owning and watching the special editions.
0140186409|3.0|Considering the age I was (12 years old) when I first read this book, I should probably be somewhat hesitant in giving my frank opinion about it.  I imagine many older readers with affectionate emotions attached to this book would have a thing or two to say about my rating.  Either way, I should enjoy recalling what my personal experience was like with this interesting piece.<br />Steinbeck is a brilliant author.  No need to deny that.  He has written many different works that both the young and old can enjoy and contemplate on.  I believe Grapes of Wrath may have been on of them.  I gave this a 3 stars although I would've preferred a 3 1/2.<br />This book was somewhat long and a bit slow-paced for me.  Yet, luckily, it managed to barely hold my attention with a calming and vaguely melancholy air.  It is definitely not a read if you were looking for tragedy and disaster and bucketfuls of tears by your bedside.  Instead, Steinbeck tends to sneak in touches of bittersweet passages and theme that mingles with the smooth flow of the words.  It certainly describes the lives of the common family during the Great Depression and I suggest it for educational purposes as well.<br />I find that most books its length would have to be pretty catching to make me read through it and Grapes of Wrath did manage to do that.  I probably would've rated it higher had I not had the experience of reading a book of comparable length (Helter Skelter) and seen how much more I could enjoy one .  But I have, and it has made it evident that this classic was not satisfying enough to my tastes.  It is a neutral opinion overall, that really depends on what kind of person you are or what kind of book you aim to read.  I do suggest you read it at least once but perhaps you might want to try it out at a library before you actually invest and buy it.  It might be a while before you feel like reading again as it likes to describe somewhat similar things or events that makes the whole book blend together into a blurry illusion.  The ending was not particularily enjoyable for me, either.  I admit that I am the kind of person that likes a clear, stable, and satisfactory finale which leaves me thinking &quot;Yes, that's right.  All is said and done and as it should be.&quot;  Grapes of Wrath might leave you in a bit of a fluster after ending a bit abruptly and mysteriously.<br />Still, it is generally an enjoyable book and I wouldn't advise a person to avoid it.  I think many of you will find that you can develop quite a few opinions about it depending on your mood.  I enjoyed it in it's own way and I presume the majority of others will be able to, too.ether into a blurry illusion.  The ending was not particularily enjoyable for me, either.

B0000636UN|5.0|I have read mixed reviews of this cd. I think it is really good. I have listened to it several times and it really gets better with each play. I have been patiently waiting on this cd. The Globe Sessions is just one of those magical cd's. It is hard to follow up that one. Before all is said and done I think this one will be right up there.
B0000508U6|5.0|The only band I can think of in the past few years that eclipses Coldplay would be Radiohead.  So after listening to the Bends, OK Computer, Kid A, and Amnesiac until you know every note, word, and nuance so well you can sing the album straight through ( with guitar solos), give Coldplay a shot.  You won't be dissapointed!
1558807381|3.0|.. I just bought my own copy this week.  I have no idea which version I have - all I remember is the version I would rent out for weeks on end years ago. When my local video store recently advised they no longer held a copy, nor did many others upon investigation.. I decided it was time to get my own copy.   It arrived 2 days ago and I've rewatched it twice... I am gobsmacked by the restoration... it captures every minute detail gloriously.  But what happened to my story????.... where is the riddle scene shared by Jack and Gump?... where is the delicious beguilment Jack used to stall Miss Meg from eating him? ... the bewilderment of a captured and scared mindless Lilli loses momentum in the cuts made to this current version of the scenes, as is the dancing-dress sequence and the squirming chair ....  On the other hand I loved the Unicorns revival and wonder what other delectable treats are missing from the movie in its original entirity....  As for the music.... the latest score feels too NewAge and out of place; overall my re-viewing pleasure was greatly disjointed, to ME ... although someone seeing this for the VERY first time would be truly captivated and enchanted.  But I'm spoiled.  I want the old score and every single snippet of the movie.  Bring on that DVD dammit!!!! :DD
6304698798|5.0|Out of a 500 DVD collection, I track them all in a database and rate them. I have under 20 I rated with 5 stars. 5 stars to me doesn't come easy. I gave this 5 stars. I even have the DVD at my computer right now (I work at home) and I'm playing that final scene over and over and I get chills every time. This is life, the good the bad and the ugly of it. This is what it takes, also, to be a daytrader.  You have to have skill, you must be fearless, and you must be smart, the 3 attributes that &quot;the good&quot; had in this movie. If you have this, you can gun down stocks all day long with eyes of cold confident steel, put your gun away, and walk away. I love this movie.

B00003CXI0|4.0|The books consumed by time - commuting on the tube, 5 minute breaks at work and wrapped up cosily in my duvet deep into the night. The film, I am pleased to say, was just as seductive in pulling me away from normal life, depositing me in the gothic romance of Hogwarts with Harry and his friends.<br />The books transcended the ages here - it was my 56-year old father who introduced them to me - and the film was as eagerly received by 60-year olds as by toddlers. The actors portray Harry et al with the same naughtiness and courage as their alter-egos in JK Rowling's books (Hermione was particularly good) - the effects were, of course, manadatory and the quidditch game was brought to life on screen extremely well.<br />It is wonderful to see British talent in a world outside of Hughtopia. While London is unmistakably dry-witted and floppy-haired, it is pleasing to see a different aspect of the national character (strength, solidarity and intellect) translated onto the silver screen. Moreover, it is wonderful knowing that the film will encourage more people to read. That can never be a bad thing...

B00005RY7X|5.0|I Get Wet is one of the best rock albums I have EVER heard. It is unapologetically simple, but the music is so complex and wonderful that you can't help but rock out to it. If you like rock, you'll love this album. Buy it now.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I remember way back to 1977 or so...  I was 16 years old, and caught a glimpse of a TV ad for the new \\"Star Wars\\" movie.  It was almost being presented as an art film at first.  My friends who had seen this thing were raving about it.  I was intrigued -- I had always been a Trekkie, and this looked like a better version of Roddenberry's more thoughtful outings.  It turned out to be more of a space cowboy story, with overtones of the mythic (like the better spaghetti westerns)...  but it was nonetheless a great movie that offered a lot of fun on the surface, and more to think about if one chose.  What has happened to these promising beginnings?  Lucas has retreated to the same place all big-budget movie makers seem to have gone since the mid-80's:  An orgy of special effects.  The Star Wars saga has become increasingly dependent on computerized magic, and correspondingly increasingly pretentious.  The Phantom Menace was technically brilliant but otherwise a terrible film.  Sorry George -- I know how much work you've put into this, and I thank you for that -- but PLEASE, can we get back to the kind of thinking that went onto the first film?  A little understated legend would be much better than all that pretentious foreshadowing.  Think small -- score big.  And can we tone it down a bit on all the market tie-ins, please?
1878424319|5.0|Try not making any assumptions for one day and see what happens. The four agreements sound simple and they are. This book is short because the agreements are beautifully presented in a clear, concise way. Practicing them is a challenge. My personal relationship has changed beyond my wildest dreams with a depth of understanding, trust and love that I never thought possible. If everyone practiced the four agreements, life would be a dream.
0380789035|1.0|I can't remember another time I got so bored reading a book. I don't know why Gaiman had to try to be &quot;as good as Stephen King or your money back&quot;. I wish it were true, the &quot;money back&quot; part.. Remember &quot;Insomnia&quot;? &quot;American gods&quot; is just as boring. The story just never grips you: in the first 150 pages (the total length of some masterpieces) NOTHING happens, absolutely nothing, nada! I don't think I'll buy Gaiman again in the future. And BTW &quot;Neverwhere&quot; was not bad at all!
B000063DHL|5.0|This is the best IRON MAIDEN album of all. It's the best of all the Eighties and Heavy Metal music. This is the eightiest of IRON MAIDEN you can get. Why do you think they don't play any songs from this album live anymore, not even one. Just look at the cover, listen to THE LONELINESS OF THE LONG DISTANCE RUNNER. Specially with the new remastered stuff that brings the two video-clips of WASTED YEARS and STRANGER IN A STRANGELAND. The tribute to ALEXANDER THE GREAT couldn't have been better. There is not a song in this album that I don't like or skip while I'm listening to it. This is a must, for Maiden fans and for Metalheads and Rockers. I wished that they had a live video for this. Up The Irons!
0440213525|5.0|Mark Sway and his younger brother are in the woods when they encounter lawyer, Jerome Clifford, and witness his suicide. Preceeding the suicide Mark was told by Jerome where the most wanted dead body in the nation was. Now Mark is being followed by the killer of the body and is wanted dead himself. Through this complex crime adventure, 11 year-old Mark hires a lawyer who protects and guides him through events that change everything and gives his family a new life. I rate this book as a five out of five because of the suspense and excitement it offers. There are unexpected turns, enticing events, and compelling climaxes. The Client is a must read and will etch into your mind like no other. Also, you will be able to make many connections with the variety of characters that play roles from a single mom to a vulgar cereal killer. This book gives you the motive to keep turning the pages because you want to know what happens next. I would definitely declare The Client as a top of the line, irresistible book.
0201485672|5.0|Refactoring is another must have book for any OO developer. As with other books like the Gang of Four &quot;Design Patterns&quot;, Mr. Fowler has compiled, structured, and systematize a set of common practices that any OO developer does in his/her day-to-day work. <br />Refactoring consist roughly in reshaping and evolving your code without changing its interfaces in order to improve its internal structure and functionality as well as other attributes. Every developer knows that is very difficult to hit the bull's eye at the first attempt and the code once written must be changed a number of times to accomodate new functionality or requirements or to allow the reuse.<br />Mr. Fowler starts explaining what refactoring is using a pretty well documented and complete example, next he describes when, why, how, and where you must refactor your code and how to locate those pieces of your code that are suitable for refactoring and how to test those changes. Finally, the bulk of the book is devoted to a catalog that identifies and classifies the different refactorings.<br />The book id full of code examples in Java, easy to read and right into target. From my point of view is a good investment for any developer.
B00005JKGK|2.0|According to this film, lots of Chinese gals come to America, decorate their apartments in mod d&eacute;cor, and become obsessed with \\"success\\". My aunt is from Hong Kong and very into modern design, but I'm assuming this film is over-generalizing. Yes, mothers and daughters tend to hold petty, emotional baggage, grudges, chips on their shoulders, etc, towards each other that can last years. It's amazing how grouchy & melodramatic some of them can be to one another. I'm not talking about male bashing, either.  There's no way I'm going to empathize with a woman who drowns her own child just because her husband cheated on her. Is this some sort of warped feminism: just because men rule the world and oppress them gives women the right to murder innocents? I'd have been more comfortable with her murdering him!  I also got the impression that Tan thinks the Chinese people (in China) are apathetic towards anyone but family and close friends, which I guess could explain why there will probably never be a mass democratic revolt there: you have a billion people there who just don't care. This film does have a touching ending, but I can't seem to track down any of the cultural stories and symbols it references...
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is one of those movies you watch over and over again. You stop watching it for plot, or for entertainment, but just for that heart-warming feeling of being able to identify. Great, great movie, should be part of everyone's collecion.

0441172717|5.0|Frank Hebert wrote Dune, only to be denied by at least twelve publishers before he connected to a publisher of technical manuals, who took a gamble and published Dune.<br /><br />It was panned and trashed by almost all the critics who initially read it.  But the first printing sold out anyway, and the second printing did too.  People were picking up on the quality of this amazing book.  Hebert starting mail from fans describing their fascination with Dune.  Then he got a call from a reporter asking him if he was trying to start a cult.  His answer was \\"God no!\\"<br /><br />It's amazing that this book almost never existed, because this is one of the best books ever written.  The novel is flawlessly conceived and visualized.  The characters are very convincing.  I don't think this book was a metaphor for the world situation.  The Fremen borrow heavily from the Arab world, but look at the Arab world, much of it is desert.  If Europeans who fight in the desert end up using Bedouin techniques and use Arab words like wadi and hammadas, then anyone living and fighting in a desert environment would naturally use the techniques and vocabulary of the world's best desert dwellers, who happen to be Arabs.<br /><br />Dune does an amazing job of combining love, hate, economics, politics, and destiny.  There are so many good storylines in this book that an average author could have derived at least five books from it.  The concept of the Kwisatz Haderach alone, the ultimate being, is handled expertly here.  What would an ultimate being, a living, breathing man who is worshipped as God, be like?  How could you make the ultimate being, and how could you prepare the masses for their messiah?<br /><br />Describing this book in a short review is nearly impossible.  However, I do have to talk about the spice melange.  I'm not sure what psychoactives Herbert ever tried in his life, or even if he ever did anything, but the effects of melange are like the effects of a popular but illegal herb that most Americans have tried at least once, only multiplied a thousand-fold.  Anyone who's read the book knows spice is the cornerstone of the Empire, as its mind-expanding powers allow the human mind to manipulate space and time.  The spice also has the power to unlock genetic memories, extend longevity, and is used recreationally.  In a very subtle and engaging way, Herbert explicitly prescribes the use of mind-expanding drugs.  Mua'dib definitely follows William Blakes advice when he says \\"The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom,\\" as Mua'dib completes his development as the Kwizatz Haderach by ingesting a toxic overdose of spice, and then experienes a 'trip' in which the deepest mysteries of life are revealed to him, and he becomes nearly omniscient.<br /><br />The love stories and relationships within this book are as compelling as in it.<br /><br />As far as the bad guys in the book go, the Emperor Shaddam the IV, and his tool the Baron Harkonnen are excellent.  The Baron is truly terrifying, and he makes a horrible image.  When telling his nephew, Rabban, how to govern Arrakis, he says \\"You must be always hungry, always thirsty.  Like me.\\"  He then lovingly strokes his rolls of fat.  The Baron's sexual tastes and appetite are also sickening, yet they are described implicitly, unlike in the recent \\"prequel\\" books by Herbert's son.  At the same time, the Baron never falls into the cliches of most bad guys, and the scene in which Jessica and Paul are able to excape his cluthes is done in a very convincing way.  They didn't escape through the palace air shafts or because the Baron designed an overly complex spectacle death for them.<br /><br />All in all, buy this book, since it's most likely the best sci-fi you'll ever have the pleasure of reading.<br /><br />-- JJ Timminslar but illegal herb that most Americans have tried at least once, only multiplied a thousand-fold.

B0000634EV|4.0|Okay metal freaks, you can breathe now! I think far to many of you have been holding your breath far to long for this damn record. Okay, exhale! Down returns with a winner. When you listen to this record you would swear Phil, Pepper and the boys took these songs from their first studio session for \\"Nola\\". The production is the same as \\"Nola\\", and the band sounds like...well...Down! So here is the suggestion I got for you! Roll the bud, break out the JD and as Pepper puts it \\"Sabb Out\\" to 15 tracks of sludge and a southern way of thinking.....if you catch my drift! <br />The very first lick of \\"Lysergik Funeral Procession\\" will be heaven for herbing Down fan. What is different this time is Phil starts off doing that low end speaking voice that he has used on recent Pantera records. But fear not, the southern fried grubby sound kicks into high gear. Phil defiantly bellows \\" I get up...to face this world\\". The band from there jams, and Phil mouths off about being mad...in fact so ...mad...and then the band carries you out. Yeah...you could say Down is back! <br />\\"The Man That Follows Hell\\" has some of the best guitar work of the record. Fuzzy and just dirty the licks supply the mood for Phil who screams and barks his way through a track that has some parts that remind me of Clutch! The whirling licks make the track, and there is guitar solo that kind of goes off on it's own path, only to go high and let the whammy bar slam! Some sick harmonics follow as Phil smokes...and lets the band jam, jam and ...jam some more! How's that cloud of smoke coming? <br />\\"Stained Glass Cross\\" is the most creative song Down has ever written. Pepper sings to start, and an organ accompanies him. The tone is more light hearted, but don't worry, it is still jam happy, only the organ creates a different feel. Again I can't help to think of Clutch in the guitar work. And the chorus.....it is catchy as hell! Phil sings! He ain't done that to often. Different track! I could see this song buzzing on the airwaves! And be sure to check out yet again the guitar solo's! <br />Load up your pipe and light it. \\"Learn From The Mistake\\" is mellow...There is an occasion musical flare up, but for the most part this is a tune that will make fans of Pink Floyd stand up and take notice. Phil shows his softer side as he mumbles through the track. Forget what he is talking about...there is no point. This is one of those songs where you let the mood become you! Or the leaf...your choice my brothers! <br />`Where I'm Going\\" has a banjo in the beginning. All I can think of is a video showing a gas station in the hot south! A fat guy is sleeping in his chair with grease all over his overalls, and about 15 beer cans surround the man. And that is it...the whole video is just that one laid back moment with an occasional bird flying over head? Do you know where I'm going with this? Just listen, and I'll shut up now! Just know it is mellow, and I never thought I'd hear Phil sing to a banjo and like it! <br />Where's the beef? On \\"New Orleans Is A Dying Whore\\". All the meat and potatoes you can eat. Heavy...guitars drive this track. Phil snarls while the band builds momentum and lets go of the urge to jam like only a bunch of self proclaimed rednecks could. Killer guitars...killer! <br />\\"The Seed\\" is just brutal...nuff said! <br />What is lacking on \\"II\\"? Not much! It has the same sound production wise as the first record. The jam sessions are just as mesmerizing, but the songs lack the hard edge of the first record. Maybe this was done on purpose, or maybe they are just getting old. Either way you dudes will like it. There is no other band out there that can make you want to have a barbeque and drink beer with friends the way Down does. Eat and smoke this...up!
B00003CX5P|5.0|Qui-Gon Jinn knew he could destroy the Jedi Order with Anakin.<br /><br />Yoda knew something was up.  He might not have cared.<br /><br />Obi-Wan was merely a foot soldier.  He didn't know about this conspiracy.<br /><br />Anakin's destiny was to wipe out the Jedi.  They had grown too corrupt.  In the beginning of the movie, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are dispatched to bring a settlement to a trade negotiation.  The Neomoidians were scared to death.  The Jedi, guardians of the light side of the Force, were being used as tools of government.  To this end, they were abusing their Jedi powers.  Qui-Gon knew this.  He didn't like it.  He listened and obeyed the living Force, and put up with the politics because he was a Jedi, and could not practice outside the Order.<br /><br />Qui-Gon Jinn didn't care about politics at all.  He had zero interest in The Council's mandates.  He was disgruntled with the way the Republic used the Jedi to settle its matters.  When a chance to restore balance to the Force came along, he jumped at it.  Evidence:<br /><br />The Order knew Anakin had too much fear.  Qui-Gon must have known this too.  He was at least as capable as anyone in the order.  Still, he was going to discard his current padawan and train the boy.  Obi-Wan: \\"They all know he's dangerous.  Why don't you?\\"  Qui-Gon still insisted.<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie, Obi-Wan knew something was afoot.  This was the student catching onto the Master's true intentions.  Still, Qui-Gon told him \\"keep your mind in the here and now, where it belongs.\\"

B00005R2IS|5.0|I first saw this movie in the theatre in 1980 or 81. I have purchased the VHS version and the DVD version as soon as they came out. Since then I have been searching for the Australian soundtrack version but to no avail. When I read on a Mad Max website that the Australian version was available, I bought it immediately. Man was I blown away. This was one of my favorite movies. Now it is my favorite! How they could have released this movie with the overdub is insane. It's like watching a brand new movie. Definitely worth the price of admission. Oh and there is no comparison between this movie and it's sequels. Road Warrior was okay but Thunderdome was a joke. <BR>Turkey.
0446310786|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  I never saw the movie and didn't have to read it in high school although I am not sure I would have appreciated it then anyway.  I loved the   writing style and the message.  I laughed and cried and did not want to put the book down.  Great character development!
B00005RY7X|5.0|Hey, for any rock fan out there, this is the album we have been waiting a little while for.....Andrew W.K.'s songs all possess a quality of sound and force that keep you entertained for the whole record!....I can't wait to see him live at Ozzfest!
B00005JLCI|5.0|This rendition of Shakespeares tragedy Hamlet is extraordinary.  Kenneth Branagh plays his character quite well along with Kate Winslet.  Buy this movie!
B00005RY7X|5.0|I hadn't heard of A.W.K. until I saw them perform on the Carson Daly Show(I can't stand Carson, but I like the bands).  They were singing a song about New York City, and I thought it was awsome.  So I decided to buy the CD based on that song alone.  I was blown away when I heard the record.  It's been so long that I've heard a new band that can rock like these guys do and also do it without rapping.  It rocks from front to back, but it's not just metal.  Although every song has a driving guitar in it, it also has piano, synthes, and so much more.  It's not often that you get to hear a band that can combine all those elements and make it sound great.  But they manage to do it.  It's great party music but it often has positive lyrics too.  It's very refreshing to hear a band that doesn't sing about how tortured they are and try to make everyone feel sorry for them.  I mean, it's not that i don't feel for them but that's all some band sing about over and over again.  You can tell that Andrew workded [hard] to get his music out there.  The music really makes you wanna move.  So if you like drivin' rock music that makes you feel good, then this is the album for you.  I garuntee you will love it!
B00005JL3A|2.0|I went into this movie expecting to see something good because i have played all the resident evil games but instead was very disapointed for starters its an R rated film but i have seen more gore and horror in most M15+ movies secondly you only get to see the lickers the zombies and the rotting dogs which were killed off a bit to quickly and with all the experimenting going on there was not one tyrant in the film it is only mentioned at the end as mentioned in other reviews they had 40 million and milla jovovich to work with and it only came out as a very average film
B00005RY7X|5.0|This is one of the best albums of all time.  ANDREW W.K. is a unique and talented musician.  Everyone should own this album.
B000002H70|5.0|Disintegration is the CD I reached for in college when I couldn't fall asleep (that's a compliment!).  Within 1 minute of hearing the opening track, I would feel myself floating away, riding the wave of Robert Smith's vocals and the ambient synth &amp; guitars.  Hearing this CD for the first time is like reading a poem that strikes you in the heart and stays with you for a very long time. Feeling miserable has never felt this good! You can completely immerse yourself in this CD.  My favorite tracks are &quot;Disintegration,&quot; &quot;Plainsong.,&quot; and &quot;Fascination Street.&quot;  The raw emotion and intensity of the song &quot;Disintegration&quot; is simultaneously heartbreaking and lovely.  If you don't already own this CD, you are missing out.
B000002GVO|5.0|What people miss about this truely great album (I just love Joe Walsh!!!) is the greatest song the Eagles wrote.  The last resort is the most profound song of our generation.  It talks about how White man has destoyed all it has conquered and if the last resort will also be ruined.  The Eagles were great until Joe joined them, they then became a super group.
B000063WDH|5.0|This band, made up of two Akronites, will make energy come out of your eyeballs.  If you like delta blues, rock n roll, and hype beats, then you will like The Black Keys.  They are going on tour and are playing with Jon Spencer's guitarist Judah Bauer. Beware though, their music might kill you because your brains will be destroyed from rock overload.
B00004Y6NT|5.0|I originally bought this just because &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; has always been one of my favorite songs.  It is different from a lot of other things they've done, but to me, this is one of their very best albums.  I love the stories MK tells. These songs are very capivating.  I prefer the songs where you really get to hear the guitar.  &quot;Single-Handed Sailor&quot; made me the repeat button on.  I call it a must have for any one who thinks they love Dire Straits.
B00005RY7X|5.0|this album is phenomenal. if you have ever loved big, fun, exciting rock songs, you will no doubt appreciate i get wet, the amazing debut by Andrew WK. This album, to me, and i'm sure countless others, represents a musical force with the intention of crushing whiny, pretentious bands like puddle of mudd, staind, and creed. every song rocks unapolagetically hard. Andrew says his music is meant to be music to feel alive to, and he is right. i can think of few other albums where i can feel like the people singing are being honest in whatever emotion they sing about. this album is possibly the most energetic thing i've ever heard. if you ever feel like listening to an album that will make you feel alive, this is it.<br />I LOVE NEW YORK CITY!!!!
B0000634EV|5.0|Just wanted to add another 5 star review for this superior CD. Refreshingly different than either Pantera or COC, there is a great bluesy, trippy, swampy feel to the whole approach. It's nice to have some real rock to listen to when all the radio will play is that detuned Limp Linkin Korn drudgery.<br />Stained Glass Cross is a great tune and worth the price of the CD alone. I haven't removed this from my CD player in over 2 weeks and it will probably stay there for some time. Great job Down!
0553260111|1.0|I decided to pick up this book based on the favorable reviews and the upcoming movie.  Sadly, this book was nothing but an EXTREMELY boring disappointment.  <br />It has its moments, but Ludlum can't sustain the intensity.  One chapter may be compelling enough to reel you in, but then it allows your mind to wander in a cascade of lackluster chapters.  Not only is Ludlum a very poor writer, but he's also not a particularly good story teller.  Through the mind of Jason Bourne, he routinely states the obvious and continues to restate the obvious through extremely tedious dialogue.  Although I'm sure it's a great sleep aid for insomniacs, it took all of my will power just to finish The Bouring Identity to the bitter end.
B00005RY7X|5.0|By far, one of the best CD purchases I have ever made.  This album is great to listen to anytime, really really loud.  The music all great, all has the same feel so if you like one- you'll like them all.  Anytime you listen to these songs, you're instantly put into a good mood and want to rock hard and give yourself a head injury.
B000002KB8|4.0|First of all, this album is ample proof that a band's first album is not necessarily their best. I don't get the people who always say &quot;a band's first album is their best&quot;, on most of the truly legendary bands all agree this is not the case, and even as you go further down the scale seldom do you find a band that spends their whole career trying to live up to their first album....heck, &quot;Nevermind&quot; was Nirvana's second album. But back on topic...this was the critical blow that truly started heavy metal. Led Zeppelin's debut almost got us there, but it was this album that truly employed many of the characteristics including the dark lyrics and darker guitar sounds, although this album does still have some blues influences. And if you look around at today's bands, you will see that many bands have a much bigger Sabbath influence than a Zeppelin one. (and yeah, even some of the good ones)<br />So this album kicks into gear with the classic title track. It hasn't aged gracefully, but it's still a great metal track...it just isn't quite so scary anymore. They do a great job of building this one up though from verse to verse, and it sure doesn't feel to me like 6 minutes. Next, we have the more blues-based &quot;The Wizard&quot; with its harmonica intro. I have always been partial to this one too, just because Sabbath would never tread too much into the blues again after this song, and they weren't bad at it. The second side opens with a tune called &quot;Wicked World&quot; which is good but kinda gets lost in the shuffle.<br />But these three tracks take up only about 15 minutes of this album. The rest of this album is dominated by either two suites or two attempts to lump lots of songs together to see how long a track time could be created. The third track is four parts and 10 minutes...and while &quot;Wasp&quot; and &quot;Behind The Wall Of Sleep&quot; aren't bad and &quot;Bassically&quot; is a funny short little bass solo, it's &quot;N.I.B.&quot; (which takes up more than half the running time) which steals the show here. From its famous riff (and yeah, those first four notes are nicked off &quot;Sunshine Of Your Love&quot;, but the next few notes are different and make this one of my favorite riffs of all time along with that), this one has it all. The other suite is even longer with less parts to space out...three parts and 14 minutes, which 30 years longer is still the longest Sabbath track of their career. Now, the main part of this is good, and the end is good, and that little part called &quot;Sleeping Village&quot; is good, but most of this &quot;A Bit Of Finger/Sleeping Village/Warning&quot; suite is devoted to guitar soloing by Tony Iommi. Now, Tony is certainly not an AWFUL soloist or anything, but his style was more in creating riffs, and sitting through FIVE or SIX minutes (yes, really!) of average level soloing really gets on your nerves after a while.<br />So overall, this album was very tough to rate because it's also tough to listen to Ozzy in his lower range for a lot of this album, plus we have that meandering solofest. Consider this a low 4 stars, but it would get much better from here on the next two.
B000002ADT|5.0|In report card terms this disc is an A+ in an AP course.  Advanced musicians doing their best and pushing the envelope, all the while without alienating novice ears. It has a melancholy yet uplifting quality, the music has the rare ability to stir various emotions simulataneously. This is the standard classic jazz album by which all others are measured and whenever a debate concerning the best jazz album comes up this  1959 materpiece enters the discussion. All the superlatives aside, the all star group assembled is magnificent (check the personnel)but the music speaks for itself. This reissue is better than other versions because it includes the only alternate take during the session which was the beautiful &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot;  whose music plays on eternally  on the lingering, crystalline  last note played  by Gil Evans. Another reason is that this is the first corrected version  of the music's sound quality because past issues were &quot;off, &quot; without getting to technical , suffice to say the speed of the tape was in error on all other versions. It may sound corny but this disc swings . It has an elegant grace found in too few records which is part of what makes it stand out from the rest. This is probablty my third or fourth vesion of this music and I never get tired of it, having played it probably more than other disc in my collection, night or day, it makes no difference. It is one of those that can be repeated several times consecutively without  ever becoming stagnant, it always sounds fresh. It is essential  music, desert island music if you will. It has influenced countless musicians in various unlikely genres. If you are new to jazz try this for the quintessential  masterpiece, if you haven't heard this in awhile or have an old copy get this version now.
0790734060|5.0|Theres only one way to describe this movie...  Highly entertaining. I was mezmerized watching F. Murray Abrahams masterful performance which won him an Oscar... If this movie dosent make you a Mozart fan, It will certainly make you an F. Murray Abraham fan. You must see this movie.
B0000640VO|5.0|When this movie came out, I saw it two weekends in a row, then took my friends to see it, then saw it once more before it finally left the theatre.  This movie is definately delightful and uplifting.  It's such a breath of fresh air when most movies today seem so alike, as though they were created using the same formula.  This movie is so ingenious and original that it sets a new standard for movie makers....Hollywood, get with it!
B00005RY7X|5.0|This awesome album amazed and entertained me completely !  With 90's like songs mold with 80's style beats and rhythms, this absolute party album is for caveman's only !  It is pure caveman rock that will pick you up from any bad day !  Packed with inspirational songs to get you movin, this album does not need offensive language to get its message across.                                                           Warning:  This music is for Partying Caveman's across the globe ! So, grab your woman by the hair and Party Hard !
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan is great music and everything. i love these guys. The music is so upbeat and it inspires me for a good day every morning when i listen to it! I think everyone should own this cd for a good time...yea...its just as good as that ::wink:: Heh..Rock on!
B00005RY7X|5.0|Alright people if youre even thinking about buying this CD then get off your butts and do it! This CD is and was well worth my 15 bucks and it should be for you too! I'd pay 40 bucks for this CD, Andrew W.K. is the best thing thats hit the music world in a long time and I hope that everyone thats reading this has or is going to buy this CD!
B00005RY7X|4.0|Great songs, meant to be heard loud. Finally some new music I like!
014028009X|1.0|I couldn't even get through the first chapter, and I absolutely hate how the author basically based it as a modern version of Pride and Prejudice. Yet Bridget is not \\"perfect\\" like Elizabeth Bennet ( P & P's heroine). Bridget is very wacky and does very silly things. It was just so boring to read in \\"diary format.\\" The one thing that I like about the character is that she has her flaws. So that makes it more realistic. However, I must say that one ought to stick to Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen instead. Even though I did not like Bridget Jones's Diary, I did like the movie. I finally understood Bridget and who she was, and in the movie she is a very lovable character so I would reccomend the movie over the book.
B00005RY7X|5.0|I first saw AWK on MTV2 maybe 3 months agao..and those 2 words..PARTY HARD stuck in my mind..and played over and over.<BR>I finally bought 'I GEt Wet' and i consider it the greatest CD i have ever bought. I say that even if you don't like garage rock that you buy this casue it's that great.
B000002UKS|5.0|This is one of the best if not the best rock cd ever
B00005JKL8|3.0|This would be a boring movie if it weren't for the direction.  Owen Wilson is on the run most of the time and never really fights back.  I guess that's understandable because he is surrounded by people trying to kill him.  The movie was marketed as being patriotic but really just shows how stupid it is to allow foreign military officers to be in command of another country's soldiers.<br />What makes this movie entertaining is the slick direction of the action scenes.  What stood out to me was the scenes where there was no music, just the sound of Wilson running or being chases.  Kind of reminded me of the old James Bond movies where you didn't need the music to tell you how to feel.  A good rental.
B00005RY7X|5.0|I picked up &quot;I GET WET&quot; after hearing all the hype from my friend, and let me tell you, this is the best album I have picked up in a while. Track after track Andrew W.K. pounds out the songs that make you want to party till you puke, seriously. Luck didn't get this group to the charts, the rockin party metal did.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Zoolander and Ben Stiller have taken the fun and innocence and energy that was behind original spoof movies such as Airplane and Top Secret and created a new kind of comedy/spoof/satire for the 21st century.<br />Zoolander is fresh and original and hilarious.  While it is set in the fashion industry, and career most viewers can't relate too, Stiller keeps the movie simple to allow the viewers to enjoy the jokes.  In my opinion, Zoolander makes fun of competition, role models, TV shows, a few other movies, stereotypes and many other broad categories.  The humor doesn't feel forced, like in so many current teen spoof comedies.<br />Stiller and Wilson are excellent and I recommend this DVD to anyone.
B0000019PA|5.0|Great sound and refreshingly enough, a bit different from the usual tripe. Never would have thought I'd have enjoyed the melodies produced by some of the instruments they use (some sounding strangely akin to bagpipes on one track) so much. Highly recommended.
B00005JKHP|5.0|I love Star Trek, always have. But I think I finally understand why ST 1 has a different feel. I think it is because they tried to emulate 2001 and not Star Wars. The other series are emulating Star Wars more. With better acting, characters, stories, etc. of course...<br />This DVD is a great buy. The director's changes are not all that noticeable unless you just saw the older version the day before. They are very subtle. Beyond the movie, the gems are the behind the scenes featurettes. They are cool. Including information and some short takes on Star Trek II (the supposed-to-be spinoff that got turned into the movie) and how they produced the new changes to the movie. Those featurettes are very interesting. You'll enjoy them. Plenty of hours of stuff to watch.
0887306667|1.0|It has nothing to offer anyone now, it's too old.
6305558167|4.0|This movie is an interesting re-telling of the classic Arthurian legend. And there are a few surprises. You get to see Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) in his first movie! But what surprised me most was the violence. Far more graphic than I expected when I got it. The commentary is realtime with the movie and the director rambles at times. Still, he had some interesting nuggets in there. Overall this is a good re-telling, with a nearly all Irish cast, but it doesn't really leave you with this desire to immediately see it again.
0385484518|5.0|I loved this book. It made me laugh. It made me cry. It made me think about those things in life that sometimes easily pass us by. A very easy read and one to share with a friend!
B00005JKNF|3.0|Gosford Park is about the people on the first and second floor of a beatiful buildin that people came for as a retreat, but a Clue-like murder happends and everyone is a suspect. Unfortunally, the film doesn't start until the last hour really. It is slow moving, but there are other points in the film where it shines. The acting, the lighting, the cinematography, and all that sort of stuff is very well done. Also, this is not a comedy like the previews made it seem. Like another Best Picture nominee, In The Bedroom, this is not a film for everybody. It is a little more artsy than the average movie watcher enjoys, but art-house fans and film-makers will love this. It, however, did not deserve the award for Best Screenplay which it stole from the best thriler of the last year, Memento. I recomend this, but I do not guarntee that you will like this film.
B00005RY7X|5.0|The messages that Andrew W K and his album deliver are incredible. Its an Album for thoughs who live life for every drop, and want to savor every second, and not waste any of it, for people who want to party hard, and live life to the fullest. The message AWK delivers is like a bible of today, not to waste life, and that eveyrthing should be experienced to the max. BUY THIS ALBUM!
B00005JKCF|5.0|worry about the quality of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man. It is definatly one of this years best. Spider-Man is of course about the super-hero made famous in the comic book series, The Amazing Spider-Man. For those of you unfamilar with series (AND SHAME ON YOU IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO SPIDER-MAN IS!!), Peter Parker was bitten by a radioactive spider and became the Spider Man, who has the poers of the spider. He can swing with a spider web, has a spider sense where he can sense danger, and can stick to walls. He also has amazing strength. Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker\Spider-Man. In this movie, which is the first of a trilogy, has Spider-Man battling the Green Goblin played by Willem Dafoe. Also in the movie is Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane, Spidey's love intrest, Bruce Campbell (of Evil Dead fame), and Macho Man Randy Savage. Dunst deserves a Academy Award nomination for her performance in Spider-Man. But it is not just the performances in the movie that makes it.<br />A great challenge to making Spider-Man is recreating the action and suspense from the comics. The comics had Spidey slinging from building to building, jumping from roof to roof, and more. The visual effects in this film make it truly Spider-Man The Movie. The action is recreated by somesort of way that is beyond me. I am not one who does not know about Special FXs. One good thing about the film is the screenplay. No B-Movie lines that weasel their ways into films (\\"And on the seventh day, man will rest... in peace!...\\"=Worst Line Ever From Mortal Kombat 2). Costume design was very important to the film. From Spider-Man's costume to the Green Goblin's suit to event the dresses that Mary Jane wears, nothing was left untouched. Makeup was also perfectly done to recreate the way that the characters looked in the comic book.<br />In short, Spider-Man is one of the best films of the year and was along with Resident Evil as one of the best films of the year. It will not disappoint fans of the comic book at all.  It has great performances by all, Special FXs that perfectly capture the comic book, and a well done screenplay. After you have watched the movie (and don't forget to watch it more than once!), go play the game and get the toys to recreate the action from the film. But, the thing that everyone should do is read the comic books once again. I am really looking forward to the sequels, the second one is going to come out 2003 or 2004, which will most likely have Dr. Octopus or Venom. This will also hopefully not go the way of the Batman or Superman movies that [stunk] after the second one. This is a film for comic book lovers and non-comic book lovers alike, so don't take the reviews to heart. See it yourself. I didn't regret it.
0060298812|4.0|Possibly reissued to capitalize on the Harry Potter frenzy, this story will certainly appeal to many of his fans.  Sophie is doomed to learning the family hatter trade while her two younger sisters go off to have adventures.  Sophie is afraid to even visit them as a strange castle which moves through the air has appeared in the kingdom.  Supposedly the owner, Wizard Howl, likes to suck out the souls of young girls.  Then one day a wicked witch turns Sophie into an old woman and she ends up taking refuge in Howl's castle. The characters are delightful, especially the fire demon who lives in Howl's fireplace. The different puzzles the plot presents - like who exactly is Howl and why is the fire demon bound to him and why was Sophie enchanted - keep the reader turning pages.  Humorous situations constantly arise which would make this a good read-aloud for upper elementary students, also.  The magic doesn't feel contrived as a tactic for moving the story along.  It seems perfectly reasonable for a pair of seven league boots or an invisibility cloak to appear when needed.  The ending may require a second reading as things moved along rather quickly at that point as the pieces of the puzzle came together.  The book was designated by the American Library Association as a \\"Best of the Best in Young Adult Literature, 1966-1992.\\"  The primary audience would be middle school/junior high, although high schoolers and adults will also find it a quick, entertaining read.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Aliens is one of the best films ever made and is way better than Alien. Unfortuanlly, the 2 bad sequels can kind of out shadow it sometimes. Aliens takes Sigourney Weaver, in a Oscar-Nominated Role, and has it where she is in the future. She goes back to the alien's planet and must defeat them. She teams up with some of the most memorable characters from any film, the Marines. Lead by Corporal Hicks (Michael Biehn of The Terminator), they are tougher then the aliens, but not as quick. <br />Aliens was breakthrough in Special FXs and makeup effects. The alien queen, from the cover of the DVD, is a very life-like creature and looks like it can do a lot of damage. It has amazing set designs of the Alien queen's hive and the colony of which the aliens have taken over. <br />Sadly enough, the DVD doesn't due this film justice. It does not have the special features that Aliens needs. But, this is still a must have for any collection.
B000002J1U|5.0|zeppelin is incredible -- every song is amazing on this cd, every one. there is nothing else to say.
6304712936|5.0|Amadeus is rather the story of the man who killed Mozart rather than the man himself. The man who became one of the most gifted composers of all time. The story portrays Mozart as a oddball, who wouldn't be consider a genius by the way acted. F. Murray Abraham plays a man who is filled of anger against him and hates him beyond all recogntion. This is one of the best films of all time, and a true masterpiece. It is slow moving and has one of the most terrible DVDs ever made. It is a disc you have to flip over to play the other side and the director's cut is comming out later this year. Wait for it, unless you really want to say it.
6302752337|2.0|In 1969 \\"Easy Rider\\" caused quite a stir, but it started aging fast. Within two years it started to look dated, as evidenced by the clip they showed on the AFI top 100 movies award show (Dennis Hopper's \\"nobody wuvs me 'cause I have long hair\\" speech). After more than 30 years, Easy Rider has decayed to a point where it is more than laughable, it is positively moldy. Fans of the movie describe it as a movie about freedom. However, the freedom of this movie is the same freedom a 2 year old feels when he learns to say, \\"no\\"; it is ignorant, self-centered and very irritating to mature onlookers. This childish spirit permeates the movie on all levels. One can almost hear the director saying, \\"I'm gonna make a movie without a centralized plot, 'cause I can!\\" The actors, for their part, seem to be saying, \\"I'm gonna do drugs, 'cause I can!\\" and \\"I'm gonna ride around aimlessly, 'cause I can!\\" What it amounts to is a pointless exercise in pretentiousness that is so in love with its own rebel spirit that the audience is quickly forgotten. Nothing comes of the character's self indulgence. They do not grow, they do not learn, heck they don't even seem to enjoy a lot of what they do. Yes, I realize that talk of responsibility and growth is exactly what would peg me as a \\"square\\" by the movie's characters, all the more evidence of its datedness I say. While whiny, self-indulgent boorishness may have been fashionable 30 years ago the \\"message\\" rings hollow today when you see all the ex-hippies in rehab or safe in their corporate jobs.<br />People who claim that negative reviewers \\"just don't get it\\" should consult their history books.  The Human Potnetial Movement of the 60's was founded on the idea that putting less restrictions on people's behavior would make them better.  \\"Easy Rider\\" seems to depict the opposite, suggesting that given more freedom people will just indulge themselves and waste away.  If anything, \\"Easy Rider\\" is anti-freedom, anti-life affirming, basically anti everything except its own narcissistic vision.<br />I give the movie 2 stars for the cinematography and the musical score.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I usually avoid hyped-up movies until it's 3rd week of release so I don't have to listen to the gossip around me from the local high school. I need to be \\"into\\" the movie. Spiderman get's you into it, fast. The story line was excellent. The chemistry between tobey and kirstin was adequate. The fact that they stuck pretty close to the comic book story line was well appreciated. The movie is fun from start to finish, except the very end bothered me a little. (Have to wait for the sequel). Overall, an excellent movie! I will see it again, at least one more time in the theater. Go see it! You will love it!
B000002U82|5.0|In my opinion, this is one album that EVERYONE should own. My mom is a huge Pink Floyd fan, so I grew up listening to this album more times than can be counted. Most concept albums are sort of a chore to sit through and the message is so confusing, it's hard to understand just what a band is trying to say. This is not the case with Dark Side of the Moon. Listening to this album all the way through is so great, that you wish there was MORE! Obviously there are some songs that stand out just as well by themselves (Time, Brain Damage) but they sound so much better being complimented by the instrumentals (The Great Gig In the Sky is such an amazing song). Personally, I think you will get a better sense of the band by buying this CD, rather than picking up their whopping 2 disc greatest hits collection. This is an album no music fan should be without. Go out and buy a copy for you and everyone you know.
0815411839|5.0|Donald Spoto bases this book on the facts...not speculations and unseen sources. This is a very detailed account of Marilyn's Life,from the early years spent as a starlet thru her marriages...relationships with famous photographers and acting coaches thru ordinary people...<BR>Marilyn's last days are realistically brought back to Life with a plausible explanation of what really happened the night she died.<BR>One of the best parts of the book is the last chapter \\"Aftermath: the great deception\\", where Donald Spoto adresses all the tabloid biographies that sensationalize marilyn's death...the theories and speculations about her involvement with the Kennedys and the mafia and so called \\"best friends\\"....<BR>Such as Robert Slatzer and jeanne carmen, to name the worst offenders among them.<BR>I have read all the mayor Biographies on Marilyn and this one for me comes closest to what the truth might be about what happened to marilyn.
0790729628|2.0|Yup, I liked the narration and the original ending.  It helped the movie move along.  This doesn't have it and I find myslef quite bored.    Why weren't both versions put on the disc?
B00005JKJA|5.0|Hollywood doesn't release many films that can't possibly be fully comprehended in one viewing, but if you DO enjoy a good multi-layered departure from straight narrative and sequential storytelling, David Lynch's MULHOLLAND DRIVE is the most rewarding vehicle you'll likely see since Howard Hawks helmed THE BIG SLEEP in 1946.<br />Yes, this IS a complex story whose plot cannot be explained in a single sentence. Yes, it DOES require two or three viewings before the intricacies of the puzzle begin to fall into place, and yes, it DEFINITELY IS a puzzle worth the effort and patience to solve, for once you do, you'll discover there is much method to director Lynch's madness. It's a rare film I can honestly say the more I watch, the more I want to experience it again, and again.<br />The most interesting revelation I've come to realize while watching this film is the way Lynch turns the tables on his audience. You begin this cinematic Mobius strip by watching a long, dream-like fantasy as a starry-eyed ingenue named Betty from Palookaville arrives in Tinseltown and accidentally becomes involved with a helpless amnesiac (who calls herself Rita). Nancy Drew-style, Betty decides to help her friend regain her memory and put her life back in order.<BR>\\"It would be just like in the movies!\\" she beams with excitement.<BR>However, Rita gradually reveals herself to be someone who is not as she appears as the film skews off on a nightmarish tangent, leaving the VIEWER to solve the puzzle of the two women and how the events surrounding them relate to each other. As the mystery unfolds, you become immersed in a tragic story of unrequited love and dreams gone sour in a land where dreams are often made, or in this case, shattered.<br />No matter how you feel about the film afterwards, it stays with you for a while. I have to wonder (since he refuses to discuss the plot in interviews) if Lynch ever undergoes a moment of blissful schadenfreude when he hears about the anger and spiteful feelings his movie arouses in those who can't cope with it's complexity. In fact, you have to wonder if those are the ones he wrote the story for in the first place.<br />Oh, well... whatever. I'm sure there will be many more re-hashings of old TV shows and remakes of antiquated blockbusters released in the theatres to appease the most undiscriminating of tastes. Meanwhile, some of us would like David Lynch to know that if MULHOLLAND DRIVE is the caliber of work that can be expected from him in the future, he'll always have a faithful audience.
B000002AH9|4.0|Holiday's last great recording glows with her innate and letter-perfect phrasing and musicality.  But the voice, ragged from a life of pushing too hard, playing too much, succumbing too often, is harrowing.  There's still flexibility in it, and its very rawness makes the album terribly moving.  But stacked against the insouciant bravado of her great early recordings, &quot;Lady in Satin&quot; is almost too painful to listen to all the way through.
0380789035|4.0|There are very few contemporary novelists that are capable of creating such imaginative parallel worlds as Neil Gaiman.  His ability to interweave gods, faeries, and other-worldy creatures into modern life is unparalleled.  We saw this in Stardust and in his Sandman series of comic books and we see it again in American Gods.<br />This story plays out like a dream... you find yourself wandering through the American landscape with the Gods brought here by our immigrating and exploring ancestors.  The characters are well-developed and the plot twist is virtually unexpected (though close, contemplative readers may disagree with me on that point).  I devoured this novel 100 pages at a time and came out on the other side of it with a greater interest in mythology and American cultural history than I had before.  Still thinking about the story, over a week later.  Definitely signs of a good novel.<br />I won't give away too much more about the story, suffice to say that if you're a fan of Gaiman or the fantasy genre that he inhabits, you're bound to enjoy this book.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Do you remember being a kid and jumping on the bed, not a care in the world, just trying to jump as high as you can?  That is what &quot;I Get Wet&quot; is. This album will make you want to pump your fist in the air, this album will makeyou want to sing along, not caring what the people in the car next to you are thinking.  This album will change rock and roll.  It is not the next big thing, it is not going to start a trend.  It will however make you feel good about yourself again.  It will make you feel like a kid again.  From the first track, &quot;It's time to party&quot; to the last &quot;Don't sop living in the red&quot; the adrenaline does not stop flowing.  Take what you will away from the lyrics, on the surface seeming to be a celebration of good times, but when actually each song is about self-empowerment and just being able to live one's life on one's own terms to the fullest extent and making every minute of every day count. You need this album, not just for something new to listen but improve you oulook on your own life.

B00005RY7X|5.0|Seriously, talk about one of the most innovative albums ever! The drums never stop, the guitar slamming through the beat and the lyrics filled with tons of hooks that keep that song in your head ALL DAY LONG! This busts open the genre of rock and creates its own style, its own feel.<BR>This is an album for someone who is looking for energy and feeling in their music. I reccomend it to anyone who can handle it!
B000000OMP|3.0|Just listening to this album again after oh...16 years or so, brings me back to the mid 1980's and to the great hard rock that came out of that decade.<br />Whitesnake's \\"Slide it in\\" kicks [rear end]. Even though all the songs, with the exception of the ballads, sound relatively the same, this album is still quite a powerhouse of rock and roll, 80's or not.  It is just a good rock album, and I think David Coverdale has a very strong and bold voice reminiencent of Robert Plant.  I'm sure Zeppelin was a great inspiration to Coverdale(who later toured with Jimmy Page).<br />I definitely recommend picking this album up if you appreciate hard rock, so long as you don't mind alot of the songs sounding so much alike.<br />\\"Slide it in\\", and \\"Slow and Easy\\" are without a doubt great rock anthems.  CRANK THEM UP!!!
B00005RG6M|5.0|How do you review a dvd-audio such as this one?<BR>A recording from 1975, yet it sounds as if it were recorded <BR>only yesterday. Queen at its best, with Freddie's piano, <BR>Brian's guitar, Roger's drums and John's great bass riffs.<BR>The piano and bass guitar sound great, and the vocals are<BR>fabulous. I'm afraid the standard CD will be collecting as<BR>much dust as the LP from now on. Should hollywood records<BR>plan to release more of these beauties in the future, than <BR>it'll cost me a lot of money yet again to collect them all.<BR>For all you Queen fans out there a MUST, for music fans and<BR>sound addicts another great demo.
B0000668IF|5.0|If you like Moby, you'll surely like this album.  It probably won't change anyone's impressions either, though.  It's a continuation from Play, with many of the riffs sounding familiar.  The songs are varied, making it a solid album.

B00005RY7X|5.0|If this album doesn't move you-maybe you should start looking into retirement communities. This album gets rid of all the pretty boy rap rock and gets down to just the rock. No ego here, just a one track mind focused on a mega party from hell. And maybe all you pretentious little emo people that have to have the most cutting edge, latest in fashion, nerd pop-rock should try partying till you puke. Who doesn't love to party?!?
B00005RY7X|4.0|Well people if u have not already bought this album, Why not?<br />Andrew W.K's album I Get Wet is a must have for anybody's collection. With songs like Party Hard and She is Beautiful which u can see being played on MTV2. <br />Andrew has a way with his music to get u off your seat and jumping around the room. The album is full of energy and fun which is missing in a few acts which are around these days. <br />I really love this album and enjoy just letting loose and having a good time, this album rocks and u just can't help singing along to the catchy tunes. <br />Enjoy.....................

B00004XQP4|4.0|Green Day's latest cd is not as good as any of their others. But its not that bad. Other reviewers have said this album was a sell out because it not the same thing they have done for the past ten years. One person said that being punk was not caring what any body else thinks and doing what you want to. Dosn't this album prove that Green Day is one of the most punk bands out there? If they made Dookie three or four more times, you'd be complaining that its all they can do and they have no creativity. Another reviewer seems to think that only people over the age of 18 have good taste in music. I am only 15 and this comment offends me greatly since I generally like any genre of music(classic rock, motown, heavy metal, ska, punk, blues, etc.(execpt mindless pop and country, and rap(mostly) music)and I think (and other people have told me) that I have and excelent taste in music. I still think Green day is one of the best bands, even if this album does't prove it.

B00005RY7X|5.0|This is a great record full of energy and its one of the bests albums Ive ever listen to. Feel all the energy and get ready to rock with Andrew W.K. this great guy will change your world!!!
B000002KBA|4.0|This compact disc release demonstrates Deep Purple engaged &quot;in rock' 'n' roll&quot; and physically imbedded in what appears to be metamorphic rock (although they could be portrayed in sedimentary rock).  Who knows?  Anyway it is an LP's worth CD of guitar super heroics, organing, and fierce drumming.  Also, if you have the need for speed this is the CD that you should listen to to fully develop speed aspects.  Also, it is a good CD to listen to when around people with severe blockage mechanisms in their head.  The ensemble recording breaks down lameness just like rock breaks or crushes scissors.
B000000993|5.0|If you read any interview by just about any of Tool's four members, including former bassist Paul D'Amour, they will more than likely bring up their beliefs in the process of evolution, especially of the human race. Tool is living evidence of the evolutionary process, as they started their musical careers with their \\"Opiate\\" EP, a heavy and straightforward, but nonetheless impressive disc, then followed it up with the even heavier, angrier, more heavily layered \\"Undertow\\". Following was \\"AEnima\\", which blew both previous discs out of the water, then \\"Lateralus\\" which is on par with \\"AEnima\\".<br />Though \\"Undertow\\" is not their best album, it still captures that original Tool sound of angry desperation, frustration, growth, and abuse. Fearing to tread on no ground whatsoever, Maynard James Keenan leads the band with superior vocals that touch a number of subjects deemed \\"offensive\\" by the \\"normal\\" music world and which are largely avoided by most musicians, let alone people. Dealing with child abuse/molestation/rape (\\"Prison Sex\\"), alcoholism (\\"Sober\\"), self-hatred (\\"Bottom\\"), and religious hypocrisy made into a joke (\\"Disgustipated\\") and what some listeners consider sexually explicit material because they can't look for what the song is really about (\\"4 Degrees\\").<br />Backing Maynard's ferocity is a band just as equally deadly, with Adam Jones churning out trippy, crunching guitar riffs layed down by the solid guitar-like bass lines of Paul D'Amour and the perfectly timed drums of Danny Carey, easily one of the best drummers I've ever heard. None of the musicians stand out over one another, as all of them move in one seething mass, like a machine pumping out adrenaline rushing tunes.<br />Literally every track is a standout, and the frightening sound effects and terror-filled answering machine message of \\"Disgustipated\\" will be enough to frighten most listeners away. Anyone who can take their music with an open mind but sometimes with a grain of salt and is lookingfor something outside the norm definitely needs to look into Tool. However, if you must buy one of their albums make it \\"AEnima\\" or \\"Lateralus\\" first.
6305265488|5.0|I thought this movie was romantic and amazeing.  For once af fairytale depicted a smart woman who could think for herself.  It was made so well, with a  great story line.  I will never get sick of it no matter how many times I watch it.  Drew Barrymore was beautiful and fantastic.
B0000509BZ|5.0|And this is the one.  The first time I saw the Highlander movie I was<BR>awestruck at the fine job done in creating the atmosphere of the <BR>movie.  Wheather it was a Wrestling Match at Madison Square Garden,<BR>in the Hills of Scotland, or Duncan's Antique Store.<BR>The excellent Soundtrack from Queen which can be found on the<BR>CD &quot;It's a kind of magic&quot; stirs your heart with emotion.  <BR>This movie will be immortal.  But then again, who want to live forever?
B000063S6Z|5.0|After releasing this album, ofcourse every reviewer, no matter if they are from a magazine, a radiostation or whatever, will compare it to Moby's last album 'Play'. And so will I...<br />The enormous succes of 'Play' makes it very hard for Moby to come with new material that will not dissapear into the shadow of his last stuff. It happens a lot that artist who have released a great, good selling album come up with something really different(genre/sound). In this case, Moby equals the funky ambient sound that made 'Play' so special, and why shouldn't he? <br />The CD kicks of with the first single, the rock-a-like 'We Are All Made Of Stars' which everybody will probably know by this time. Good way to start! After that songs like 'In My Heart' and 'In This World' set the tone and give me the feeling I am indeed listening to 'Play 2'. Which, in my opinion, is a great sign for the rest of the tracks, because there can't be enough of this masterpieces! The song that strikes me most is 'Jam For The Ladys' which also features soulsisters Angie Stone and McLyte, very refreshing! All the other songs are in a word sublime! Better yet, when hearing 'The Rafters' and 'I'm Not Worried At All' you know there is nothing else to wish for.<br />Another thing I'd like about this, and a lot of people don't know, is that Moby doesn't sample other music, he records all the voices himself! <br />I would have given 'Play' 5 stars, so I think it's obvious why I strongly recommend '18'. Can't wait till the next one drops...
B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew W.K. did a great job of giving good party songs. These songs will get you pumped and ready for another night of partying.  Party hard.
B00005RY7X|5.0|this album is one of the best albums ive heard in quite some time, not only is the music good, but the meaning within the music is almost better, whenever i feel down in the slightest bit i throw on this record and dance it up, it never fails to put me in a good mood. keep em coming andrew!<br />- vernon
B000002G7G|5.0|Though 'Loaded' and the first album contain my absolute favorite VU songs ('Sweet Jane', 'Rock & Roll', 'Sunday Morning', and 'All Tomorrow's Parties'), this album is the definitive one to own. With the departure of John Cale and his heavier avant garde leanings, we finally see Lou Reed for what he is: a rock & roller with amazing pop sensabilities. 'Beginning to See the Light' and 'What Goes On' are flat out, balls-to-the-wall rock songs, while Lou displays his pop tastes with 'Candy Says' and 'Jesus'. The only song I found disappointing was 'The Murder Mystery', which starts out great but loses my attention after three or four minutes. If you are new to Lou Reed and VU, I recommend this album as a starting point for exploration.
B00004R99I|1.0|this movie is okay but some of the stuff in it just plain stupid. native women did not wear skirts. and thier dresses did not go above thier knees. and even if it the dress did come up high the woman would wear leggings. talking animals are just stupid if disney wanted this movie to be a good one then they should have researched native americans better. we did not talk to animals. oh yeah another thing is that native women are not tom boys and that is what pochohantas basicly is.
B00005A3KS|3.0|POINT BREAK    (USA - 1991)    Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)  Theatrical soundtrack: 6-track Dolby Stereo SR    Kathryn Bigelow's adrenaline-fuelled thriller - co-produced by James Cameron - combines Californian mysticism with pulse-pounding action set-pieces and toplines the iconic figure of Keanu Reeves (fetishized here by Don Peterman's expansive cinematography) as an undercover FBI agent who infiltrates a group of itinerant surfers (led by Patrick Swayze) responsible for a series of daring bank raids. Despite the film's relentless macho swagger, POINT BREAK aims for something more profound than your average summer blockbuster and is distinguished by some extraordinary visual conceits: From the glorious surfing scenes to the action highlights (most notably, Reeves' heart-stopping pursuit of a fleeing bank raider through a suburban landscape) to a show-stopping sky-dive sequence which lifts the film onto another plane altogether, far removed from the typical excesses of American commercial cinema.     Lori Petty (TANK GIRL) provides the nominal love interest - and very good she is, too - but W. Peter Iliff's script focuses almost exclusively on the ambiguous relationship between 'good guy' Reeves and 'villain' Swayze, drawing them together in adversity, while the supporting cast is rounded out by the likes of Gary Busey (THE BUDDY HOLLY STORY), John C. McGinley, James LeGros (DRUGSTORE COWBOY), and experienced surfers John Philbin (NORTH SHORE) and Bojesse Christopher (co-writer and director of OUT IN FIFTY [1999]), both exquisitely beautiful. However, Reeves dominates the movie with typical economy and grace, balancing his trademark 'cool dude' persona against the heavier dramatic requirements of his role as a dedicated FBI agent.     The narrative stumbles badly toward the end (Swayze's abrupt deviation from established procedure during one of the climactic sequences is totally inexplicable, and the subsequent body count would almost certainly have promptedthe FBI to dismiss Reeves from the service long before his final showdown with Swayze), but the film survives primarily as a unique combination of surfing, action and ultra-sexy young actors. Whether by accident or design, POINT BREAK has 'cult movie' written all over it.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This is one of the best investments (cd-wise) that I have made in a long time.  'I Get Wet' brings back the joy of rock and roll.  No rap garbage, nothing that makes you go &quot;What's happening to music these days?!?&quot;  Just good old fashioned kick you in the a&amp;* rock.  People have said for months now that Andrew W.K. will be the saviour of rock music, and I can say nothing but &quot;I whole-heartedly agree.&quot;  Do yourself a favor and buy this album, you won't regret it.
B0000214F0|5.0|Im a Cinema student, and after to have a deep analysis of Caligula; I think that The Stanley Kubricks star Malcolm Mc. Dowell, the great Peter O'Toole, the various Oscar winner Danilo Donati and the King of sexploitation Tinto Brass, all they joints can't make a bad movie. I saw a lot of erotic films but I never saw the intensity of Caligula with this convination of tragedy, anthology abouth the power, extreme violence, orgyes ...and satirical comedy. Every image is a controversial mix of beautifull art and genitals. The rated version could be bether for the director Tinto Brass who dont like the porno scenes included by the producer Bob Giucione. I would like to see all the original film that Brass made without Giucione. Apart of this, Caligula is a spectacular movie like a Fellini or Pasolini's masterpiece with a incredible human atrezzo details, extremely decadent atmospheres and the best art design and art direction  ... that I saw and by this reason: The best ... movie of all times.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew W K is like a walking stick of dynamite. You never know when he is going ot blow. And he does. Several times and loudly. His music is just the same as his personality, Loud, bubbly, hard, fast, and crazy. Excellent. <BR>  Maybe you have heard that the same guitar riffs are in every song, maybe you have heard that he does nothing but sing the same song over and over. So what? That same song, with the lyrics changed into 14 different ones rocks my world and will rock yours as well. The album is about living life your way, not anyone elses, and about living it to the fullest degree possible. <BR>   The album features great songs like ready to die, the most entergetic bouncy song he has to date, that showcase the enigma that Andrew W K is all about. Get ready to die people. You are going to die. Go out and live.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Well well well, you may be planning to purchase this CD that has made my last 5 months extremely grand.  Can if you will, imagine combining the hit making, hook laying consistency of Cheap Trick, mixed with the bombastic charges of White Zombie and then you will just start to understand this record. It is the happiest, funnest record I have heard in some time.  Also, catching him live is quite an experience.  I actually dont recommend many things, if you are still unsure just read and interview he has done and you will walk away not just loving the music but the man also.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This album is a wonderful start to somthing great.  Thru the entire album each song is bold and leaves a strong impression on you.  By the end you can't help but feel pumped and alive. So I commend Andrew W.K. for an amazing peice of work, he's deffinatly earned his 5 stars.
B0000668IF|3.0|Its hard for me to knock Moby at all, because he does such <BR>consistently solid work. I like this cd, but I'm slightly <BR>disappointed because there are a few tracks that sound pretty<BR>similar to Play. Some of the keyboard melodies sound pretty<BR>similar. Guess I was hoping for him to mix it up w/ some<BR>instruments or sounds that he hadn't used before - like maybe<BR>some latin influence, or violins, sax, flute, acoustic guitar...<BR>but there aren't really a variety of instruments mixed in...<BR>It is still enjoyable - like I said ALL moby is good b/c of his style, but I wish he would've added a wider variety of sounds.<BR>I guess he was trying to use variety w/ the vocals, which he<BR>HAS accomplished. - I love sinead. I also enjoyed his essay on the inside of the cd sleeve - its always nice to have an artist share some of his personal views on things.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This cd is the best purchase i have made in years.  The grinding organs and whaling vocals keep on rockin'from begining until the last beautiful note.  By mixing the sultry lyrics of \\"She is beatiful\\" with the post punk lyrics of \\"Party 'till you puke,\\" Andrew w.k. has created a masterpiece of this generation.  Every once in a great while a cd is made with such mastery of rock, if you do not purchase this cd, you have missed out on a rockin' and rollin' schooling in rockin' and rollin' that you may never find again.
B00005RY7X|5.0|My roommate doesn't get this album, but then he is a very unhappy person.

B00004XQ83|5.0|This CD is one of the greatest collections of all time. The music is what makes the movie great. If you are a fan of classic country, bluegrass, and / or southern gospel, you should buy this CD. Growing up as a Godfearing Southern Man, several of the songs sent shivers down my spine.

0517122707|5.0|If you ever watch The Simpsons, Ignatius P. Reilly is a lot like the Comic Book Shop Guy, and I think they are both hilarious. This is a book everyone should read. I know a several people who are a lot like Reilly, which makes the book both funny and depressing; realistic and absurd. A literary classic because it encapsulates our American Society into a story. Amazingly enough, it is more relavent now than it was then. Some people would say that it has been overrated which might be slightly true, but the bottom line is it is a damn fine novel and a classic. It deserves at least one read.

B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie is much more than you might expect. Darkly hilarious, it mercilessly takes swings at our materialism and artificial way of life in this post-feminist society. I almost hate to say it, but it is even more funny and relevant with the current threat of terrorism. Gives moviegoers a much needed shot of reality in a surrealistic way.
B00003CY5J|2.0|A great waste of Deniro and Ed Norton.  What you would expect from a Brando movie I guess.
B00005YW4H|2.0|I'm listening to the CD trying to figure out what I would think of it if I was unaware of the physical beauty of the artist.  My guess is that I'd like it even less, and it's not much to begin with.  That makes me a pig, I suppose, but at least I'm not so smitten with Ms. Jones that I'll start comparing her to some of the greatest female singers of the last century.  The musicianship is impressive on paper, but the actual performances end up sounding leaden and uninspired.  Of course, after 13 straight down-tempo numbers, you can forgive the band for dozing.  Jones' voice has some nuance, but frankly she sounds too much like what I suspect she is: a 22-year old desperately trying to come across as worldly.  I must admit, though, that I got a good chuckle out of the comparisons to Billie Holiday, Patsy Cline, and Nina Simone.  Are these people kidding?  Cline had the purest voice of her generation;  Simone has a dark, gutteral voodoo-priestess side that Jones' light touch can't get anywhere near, and -- Billie Holiday?  Lady Day's timing and effortless control of a song will probably never be approximated by anyone, certainly not by a wide-eyed waif like Jones.  I'll concede that this CD is good background music for an afternoon in the office; just set it on random play with your other &quot;don't want to offend the clients&quot; music and this will blend in like beige in a bathroom.
B00005OWEG|1.0|The original was great. Although when he finally got to Brando it was pretty anti-climatic to his macabre depressing trip. <br />In the original, it was interested how Sheen pushed forward on his mission through increasing insanity and as a really dulled and disillusioned character who could react to the insanity with calculated determination and clear thought due mainly to already having a hopeless dark meaningless outlook in all of life.  Sheen depicted someone already looking at life as hell and nothing really couldn't become more disturbed with dealing with extreme unfamiliar lunacy than he felt all of life was already.  Sheen's character displayed a depressed outlook mixed with an iron-will to be able to achieve beyond what normal people could do.  His disconnected emotional state let him stomach the bizaare and dangerous totally foreign situations he encountered on his hostile trek.<br />The original portrayed that perfectly.<br />In this version, Martin and his crew get to get laid by Playboy Playmates in the middle.  The story is supposed to be unbelievable.  But in a positive exaggerated way that makes it seems plausible in context.   The mildly famous surfer was surreal to meet but now they are playing with Playmates breasts in a messed up helicopter???  It made the movie corny.<br />Later, when the original had the viewer feeling as Sheen had gone beyond the final limits of where any allies held any position at all.  Beyond where no one else penetrated and he was a totally unwelcomed alien.  Just a lone hostile target creeping through enemy territory.<br />In this version, when its most desperate for ole Martin, he stumbles across some Frenchmen who give him a square meal and put him up for the night!!!!!?????!!??  They are depressed Frenchmen but the homecooked meal really takes from the mood Sheen's situation.  Sheen even gets another chance to get laid here.  So much for the morbid isolation he endlessly pushes on through.<br />The scenes should not have been there as in the original.  They made the storyline inconsistent and broke the established mood of the film.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew WK is the best artist in years! Its heavy, its fun, and its the best thing out there right now! If your a fan of heavy music, or a fan of partying you must give this album a try!!
B00005JKCF|5.0|Wonderful-Outstanding-Shocking Movie!!!  I am still blown away with how great this movie was with it's action, and drama.  This movie was exactly what I expected from Marvel, and I am not dissapointed whatsoever.<br />The Similarities from the Comic to Movie transition were as follows:  <BR>1.  The story line of how he decided to become a super hero.<BR>2.  His love for M.J.<BR>3.  His problems he faces for day-to-day living.<br />The differences from the Comic to Movie transition were as follows:<BR>1.  His web throwing is not in any way similar.  In the Comic Book he had capsules he connected to his arm, and in the movie, the webbing came from inside.<BR>2.  M.J.'s and his relationship growing up.  She didn't live next to him growing up in the comic book.  Even though this makes for an interesting story in Dramatic Romance.  <BR>3.  Spider Man was an actual photographer and worked for a company instead of being a freelance photographer in the movie.<br />Even though there are few things that were portayed differently in this movie, Sam Raimi(director) did an outstanding job.  I bow down to his excellence.  The only other problem I had going into and leaving the theatre, was the fact that the Animation(Graphics) were a bit dissapointing.  They can be easily overlooked for the fact that this movie is #1 and still rising.
B00001PE4D|1.0|I found this movie to be very slow moving. The acting was far from par. At times I just could not wait until the end so it would be over, and when it finally got there, I thought that the ending was DUMB. I was also appalled at the amount of evilness.
B00005JKDR|4.0|Monsters Inc. was a movie I had waited a long time to see.  I must say it did not really live up to my expectations.  It is all about Sulley, an average monster-turned-legend because of his amazing scaring ability.  He comes across a door with a human child in it.  He is very scared at first, but soon he and Boo (the kid) build a loving relationship.  In his quest to send her back home, he encounters danger, betrayel and friendship.  This is a sweet movie, but not too good.
B000009QO6|5.0|I found Danzig at a dark and odd time in my life and of course it was Danzig I that started helping me through it.  No matter how many times I listen to this album I just can't get the images the songs create out of my head.  With \\"Mother\\" you can just imagine Glenn strolling into his girls house telling her mom and dad off.  \\"The Hunter\\" is my favorite song due to the fact of it's sexual overtones \\"I don't use no love gun, don't need no kissin', when I get a hold of you honey, light you up like christmas...\\"  I think Danzig has made me into a more well rounded and darker individual.  A very good album for those wanting to find a little more in the metal industry.
B000003TAB|4.0|the album is fine. it's loads better than most b-side albums. it's not as good as any of the albums that came before or after it, which is only to be expected...this is a collection of bootlegs and b-sides, after all. But I am obligated to say that \\"Hairspray Queen\\" is one of the greatest songs - EVER - by Nirvana, and that it should have appeared on \\"Bleach\\". Novoselic's bassline is completely toked out, and Kurt's vocals are, shall we say, interesting. To be precise, he sounds like a pig having sex. His guitar is okay, and Channing's drums are cloddish, which add to the song's tone.  It's great. You could buy it just for this song, but there are other good ones. Find them for yourself, though. Rating - 4 out of 5
6301966562|5.0|Electric Dreams is a great movie.  It has fun music, a sweet story line and great acting.  It also explores the human machine interaction that we all endure.  Can a machine really love?  What is love?  What is a dream?  Well, watch Electric Dreams and find food for thought.
B000066C1N|5.0|First off, WOW! Bryan Adams did a wonderful job with this soundtrack. You get a real feeling for this movie. Both the setting of the Old West and you feel the emotions of Spirit within each song. Gorgeous!! Hans Zimmer also did a wonderful job on the score, as good, if not better, then Lion King.<BR>1. Here I Am(end title): 4/5. This is Spirit's victory song. He's fought his way through the worst of times and he's home, with his girl at his side. Everything looks brighter from here on.<BR>2. I Will Always Return: 5/5. Spirit's Homesick song. His memories of his freedom and life on the plains of the U.S.<BR>3. You Can't Take Me: 5/5, the best song on the whole soundtrack. This is Spirit's Fight. He will not be broken, he has a whole life to look forward to and it won't happen in no stable. The harder General pushes, Spirit will push twice as much. It just isn't going to happen. Awesome song with a raw, rough rock sound! Adams has gone back to his roots with this one.<BR>4. Get Off of My Back: 5/5. Another great song, like #3, but a little more fun. Spirit playing games with the men, letting him know it's not gonna happen.<BR>5. Brothers Under the Sun: 5/5. Spirit's and Little Creek's song, I think. They find that they have more in common then they believed. Both held down by the army, both were once free, only the land ruled them. The words resemble much of a certain Native American idea. Everything is connected.<BR>6. Don't Let Go: 4/5. Spirit and Rain's song. Sarah McLaughlin(sp?), joins Adams in this duet. Spirit is falling in love with the Lakota paint horse, and though he misses his life of freedom, for the first time, his thoughts are lost in something else, Rain. And he doesn't want to leave or forget her.<BR>7. This is Where I Belong: 5/5. Similar to Here I Am. The title explains itself. Very beautiful song, Spirit is discovering there are many more wonderful places and things in this world.<BR>8. Here I Am: 4/5. Same as the end title.<BR>9. Sound of the Bugle: 4/5. Spirit's spirit has finally been broken. He gives up, he hopes the first battle he goes to, he dies. Death is better then this. He tries not to forget who he once was. But he's a solider now. Though he will never 100% give up, there has to be a way to break free. <BR>10. Run Free: 5/5. Hans Zimmer comes into the picture a little clearer now. This is one of the songs on the official site. It's is simply gorgeous. As good as \\"This Land\\" from the Lion King SDTK<BR>11. Homeland: 5/5. Zimmer outdoes himself again. <BR>12. Rain: 5/5. Zimmer's again. Simply beautiful. Gives you that warm and fuzzy feeling.<BR>13. Long Road Back: 5/5. I love how this one starts out, how you the orchestra just brings out the feeling and tone.<BR>14. Nothing I've Ever Known: 4/5. Adams' is back. Great acustic sound on this one. Spirit is discovering a wonderful thing, love. And he just doesn't know if he should go home or stay with Rain.<BR>15. I Will Always Return(End Title): 5/5. Same as the earlier version.
B0000640SA|5.0|This is a thoroughly original movie.  This movie would be right at home in the Twilight Zone or on Playhouse 90.  Guy Pierce was convincing as the \\"guy with the memory thing\\" and Carrie Ann Moss was sweet with a hint of something you can't quite put your finger on.  Joe Pantoliano was great as the \\"good cop - bad cop\\" dual personality.  This movie kept me guessing right up to an ending that could have easily come from a John Carpenter flick.  A little twisted but nothing that should offend anyone. There are lots worse on commercial TV.  I intend to watch it again with friends who couldn't make the first screening.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Even though some of the critics give low ratings to this album, I believe they aren't giving &quot;I Get Wet&quot; a close enough listen.  This album brings a fresh sound to a stale music world by providing motivational, uplifting lyrics that really make you feel like rockin!  Get this album as soon as you can and you will appreciate Andrew W.K. as much as I do.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Chris Nolan's mesmeric thriller, Memento, is a dazzlingly original piece of filmmaking the likes of which Hollywood rarely produces. Each element of the film - from the acting to the editing - is flawless, but Memento's genius is largely based on it's unique style of narrative. <br />Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is suffering from a rare condition which has erased his short-term memory - or as he succinctly puts it, his ability to make new memories.  The film attempts  - and succeeds  - in recreating the world from Leonard's point of view. Thus, the first scene shows us what actually occurs at the end of the sequence of events that the film depicts - a polaroid of a dead man fading, then the event itself in reverse, a gun swallowing bullets, suddenly the man brought back to life. From then on we start at the beginning of a series of short scenes, each one starting where the next (previous) scene ends. In this way we are able to gain an insight into the bewildering, disorienting view of the world that Leonard is faced with, the only certainty, that his wife was brutally raped and murdered (he sustained brain damage trying to defend her) and that he must find her killer and exact vengeance. Leonard is able to make some sense of the world by writing things down, taking photographs of the people he becomes involved with, and for the really important \\"facts\\", tattooing them onto his body. Yet each time he wakes up, the only thing he remembers is that his wife is still alive, and the ways in which he is forced to realise what happened are heart-rending.<br />A tremendous central performance from Pearce allied to a fine supporting cast (Joe Pantoliano, Carrie Ann Moss), taut script, evocative photography and brilliantly paced direction make Memento a truly memorable film, and one you won't want to miss.
B0000029DD|5.0|Grace.....Simply one of the most interesting CD's you will have the pleasure to own. Buckley's Choir Boy to grit vocals, excellent guitar work, multiple tempo changes, emotional explosions/implosions, and diversity make his death perhaps the greatest music tradgedy of the 1990's. This CD is not for the narrow of mind (or mindless) music fan. If all you like is 3 cord heavy metal, dance club music, or sugar coated harmony groups, than Buckley likely will elude you. His music is also not restricted to the music snob who typically only likes things so out of the mainstream, that is unlistenable. \\"MOJO PIN\\" is not really comparable to anything I've heard before. Original at a time of recycling. One of the \\"takes a few listens\\" tunes on the CD, it introduces us to Jeff's haunting falsetto, and in tempo is all over the place. Great tune. \\"GRACE\\" continues on where MOJO PIN left off. All over the place. Ethereal, yet driven by the bombastic strumming of his accoustic guitar. His voice is all over the place... hush to screaming. \\"LAST GOODBYE\\" is the most commercial (and my favorite) tune on the CD. Great Bass line to start it out, it is tight, has unreal vocals, and is better than 95% of anything you'll hear on popular radio. \\"LILAC WINE\\" is a cover that is ok for the mellow moment. A little hokey, but, has it's place. \\"SO REAL\\" is what I call a 50/50 song. I have a love/hate attitude towards it. Not his best. Often annoying. \\"HALLELUJAH\\" although a cover, is now his most recognizable work as it has been heard on TV shows like 'Crossing Jordan\\" and I think a movie also. Haunting!... Simply beautiful guitar work, an angelic vocal and the note hold at the end is awesome. \\"LOVER, YOU SHOULD'VE COME OVER\\" starts with a Led Zeppelish organ intro and then turns into a southwestern, countryish, Chris Isaak type tune. \\"CORPUS CHRISTI CAROL\\" is a bold cover with him singing in his highest Church Cathedral falsetto. It took some balls to sing a song that so obviously sounds like heis lacking them. I like it! Again, not for the Motorhead or Rob Zombie fan. \\"ETERNAL LIFE\\" is a B sider, but, shows that Jeff is no stranger to Rock n' Roll. \\"DREAM BROTHER\\" is another B sider that has a few cool moments. The 1st 3 songs are enough for Buckley to leave a small legacy. The potential was so scary, it is a shame.
B000002IWQ|5.0|Ignore the reviewers who dismiss this album as being inferior to Presto or Roll The Bones. While those are good albums, the production isn't very good and the overall sound has very litte low end. Counterparts, on the other hand, was produced perfectly and it resulted in the best Rush album in 12 years. Also, anyone who says Rush tried to sound grunge on this record is out of their mind. Counterparts was simply a return to some of their hard rocking sounds of the 70's, long before grunge was around.<br />Every song on Counterparts is a keeper and this record flows beatifully.<br />My review of each song:<br />Animate: What a great opener. Classic Rush hard rock tune with Lee, Lifeson and Peart at the top of their game.<br />Stick It Out: Probably one of the least best songs here, but still very good. Great riff overshadows the rather pedestrian chorus, but everything else in this song rocks.<br />Cut To The Chase: Great melody and awesome solo by Lerxst!<br />Nobody's Hero: Some of Geddy's best vocals ever and great lyrics about how people put underserving entertainers on a pedestal.<br />Between Sun &amp; Moon: A personal favorite of mine. Love the chorus and Alex's guitar is wicked throughout.<br />Alien Shore: Love the bass by Geddy in this one. If this song had the production of Presto or Test For Echo, it wouldn't work, but here it does.<br />The Speed Of Love: The least best song on this album, but still good nonetheless.<br />Double Agent: This is where the album starts to get really awesome. One of Rush's most hard rocking songs, it features an awesome riff by Alex, some fantastic drum work by Peart(big shock there!) and some cool melodic vocals by Lee.<br />Leave That Thing Alone: One of the most powerful songs Rush has ever done. This song is proof that you do not need vocals for a song to be emotional. Lerxst's guitar work has never been more emotional or soulful.<br />Cold Fire: Top-notch effort featuring a superb performance by the whole band. Highlights are the solo by Lerxst, Geddy's vocals and Peart's cymbal work during the chorus.<br />Everyday Glory: Another personal favorite, this song is made much better by the addition of the acoustic guitar, which adds a lot and makes the overall sound that much fuller, especially during the chorus.

B000022TSY|5.0|The Easy Rider DVD provides viewers of this classic anti-establishment film with an in depth commentary from its key players. Hopper and Fonda discuss the physical and mental experience of making such a two-wheel classic.<br />As many reviewers have indicated, Easy Rider is very much of its time. For bikers and longhairs that meant overt rejection that is not as widespread in the 21st century.
B000065U1N|5.0|Josh Hartnett has been critisized by his girl loving fans all over the world. They need to shut up. If there his real fans they should think he should do whats best for him. Black Hawk Down is clearly is in the top 5 all time war movies. It is also the best movie Josh Hartnett has been in. Most of his fans havn't even seen the movie to say it was a dumb decsision or not.<BR>   Let's get down to it. Black Hawk Down is a masterpiece. Although it has been critisized. These people dont know what the frik there talking about. This movie was nominted for only three oscars (won film editing and best sound). Honestly I think the movie should of been nominated for best picture over Gosford Park or Moulin Rouge. And it probably would of won. All i'm saying us buy this DVD. You will be blown away.<br />Sound- 10<br />Film editing- 10<br />Acting- 9.5<br />Directing- 9.4<br />Special Effects- 10<br />Lasting Appeal- 10
0345440900|2.0|I would not recommend this book to new parents, or at least I recommend that you take this woman's opinions with a grain of salt.  Some of the things she says could be harmful, such as that babies really do not need to eat more than every 2 1/2 to 3 hours unless they are having a growth spurt.  While that may be true for formula-fed babies, it is definitely not the case for breast-fed babies.  I think that trying to follow her advice may have led my baby to wake up more often at night to get his required nourishment, and may even have caused a drop in his weight percentile.<br />She also expresses the opinion that it is disrespectful to just assume that whenever the baby is upset, he or she wants to nurse.  However, as most mothers instinctively know, nursing makes babies happy.  How can that be disrespectful?  It is definitely less convenient for the Mom to have a nursing baby fall asleep in her arms.  However, I will always have and cherish the memory of my baby being perfectly content and satisfied and trusting me enough to know that I would hold him and be there for as long as he needed me to be.  <br />Tracy Hogg says that you can use her method of encouraging the baby to eat, then be active, and then sleep without going against the baby's natural instincts and desires, but I certainly did not feel that that was the case with my baby.  Whenever I did it, I felt like I was wrenching him out of his natural inclinations.<br />As my baby has gotten older, he is naturally less inclined to fall asleep while nursing, and only needs that comfort sometimes.  However, in the beginning of their lives babies have a strong need for that high level of attachment.

B00005JKCF|4.0|This was an excellent adaptation of one the best super heros from the comics. I thought that Tobey McGuire was a great choice. He played the nerd turned hero with style (however a little stiff as the nerd). Kirsten Dunst was good-she had a better turning in Dracula. However Willam DeFoe was superb. He played the super rich scientist, turned villian/split personality with a style matched only by Jack Nicholson in Batman. The minor players such as J. Jonah Jamison, Aunt Mae and DeFoe's son were okay.<BR>The story was fairly true to the original story. The only difference is that this Spiderman can shoot webs from his skin (wrist) and not man made cartridges. I like the idea of shooting webs from his skin more fessible than the latter way.  <BR>The only problem I had with the whole thing is that, it relied on computer generated effects (for Spidey) too much. Most of his acrobatics were too unnatural for human movement. <You lose the sense of humanity when you rely on the computer more than stunt players. I would have rather seen a stunt man in the costume than a computer effect.> The reality of the story is to believe that a human has spider like strength, stamina and heightened senses.  <BR>But I do tell people this movie is worth the overprice of tickets. I will look forward to the next installment.
B0000668IF|5.0|Ever since his first platinum album \\"Play\\" which has topped the sales charts across the world, Moby has gotten both praise and a quiet backseat to the more \\"mainstream\\" music of Rock and Rap. And of course, the constant news coming from Eminem and Marilyn Manson's crazy antics has more or less taken off the spotlight off of quiet music makers like that of Moby, and other musicians that never aspired to make a noise in the media. And in Moby's case, he doesn't even bother making any unnecessary noise with his music as well. Although I liked his \\"Play\\" album because of their raves and jazz/rock/techno pieces, Moby yet proves again with his album \\"18\\" that he doesn't need sensational, catchy tunes to produce great music. The tunes themselves seems to be an almost total departure from the dance-groove styled \\"Play\\" album, but \\"18\\" has its own merits. In my opinion, I think it would be unfair to rate \\"Play\\" alongside \\"18\\" since their premise is different. Needless to say, if you are into 2 or 3 minute songs with catchy tunes, then you should look elsewhere for music. Rap and Rock provide plenty of that. Moby, however, provides great music akin to Jazz or Classical music in the sense that his music has a sense of having appreciation for things that are quiet, relaxing, profoundly sad, or just plain long lasting (\\"Play\\" had some aspects of this, but \\"18\\" proves what I'm trying to say). To say the least, Moby's music isn't for everyone. Like I said before, his tunes aren't as catchy or done within 2 minutes like Rock or Rap music, and pure music enthusiasts might be turned off by the fact that Moby is a pure Electronica/Techno musician. But all in all, if you like music in general (as I do), then Moby is an undeniable genius of our time. I might go on as to say that he's the modern classical music writer akin to Beethoven or Mozart. He doesn't concentrate upon catchiness or quick music, but he creates long, yet elegant, music pieces.

B00005RHGK|2.0|Well, I think this movie has one single reason for being worth seeing: I had never seen such a good plot fall down so bad!!<br />The reason I say this movies is actually composed by two different movies is simple: The first half of the movie is one of the creepiest, scariest and best-done of the last couple of years. It really scares the [stuff] out of you, and it also takes some well-known formulas from well-known classic horror movies. In a nutshell, the first half of it rocks!! So, I give 4 (maybe 5 stars) to Jeepers Creepers' first half.<br />I bet you would have never imagined a movie with such an amazingly created atmosphere could end up as bad as it did. The reason?? Well, what we don't know and can't see scares us the most... so, when the director decides to show the boogie man's flesh & blood, it all falls down. Not only because of the unbelievable way the plot ends, but also because of the horribly corny scenes --such as \\"no please! don't take him! take me! choose me! not my lil'brother!\\"-- gosh! it was so annoying!!<br />So, this second half of the movie earns 0 stars. And this fact (earning 4 stars in the 1st half, and 0 in the 2nd) is maybe a good reason for watching the movie. Again, I had never seen a movie break in two as this one did.<br />Hope this review is helpful.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|What can I say of Requiem for a Dream? Mmmm... Acting? After playing Sara Goldfarb, Ellen Burstyn didn't need to hold the Oscar to actually knew she deserved it. Jennifer Connelly, one of her best performances (even better than A Beautiful Mind's). Jared Leto shows us he does act, and and he does it great!<br />Darren Aronosfky's direction was superb! The way he decided to picture a reality a lot of people live is just amazing. Editing was also great!<br />I saw the movie in the theater, and I remember the room was completely crowded (mostly by annoying teenagers who were chattering too much). As soon as the movie started, somebody pressed Mute in the theater. It completely caught our senses and full attention. No teenager said a word as the movie went on. And when it ended, everyone of us just decided to stayed on our seats for a couple of minutes, like if we were waiting for someone to bring us back to our reality. <br />I didn't hesitate when I saw the DVD, I just took it and buy it. I have to say I haven't had the nerve to play it again. I just wanted to own one of the best movies I've ever seen (even though I still don't know if I want to see it again).<br />You won't be forgiven if you miss this movie, but if you decide to see it a second time... dude, there might be something wrong with your mind!<br />Watch it, Rent it, Buy it, Enjoy it (if you can say so)
6301790170|5.0|Inspired in part by the many Strangers-brought-together-by-a- mastermind type of heist film that was quite popular in the seventies and came back as Quentin Terentino's Reservoir Dogs in the nineties, this is the angle which Friedkin adopted for the retelling of the Wages of Fear, a novel made into a French film which achieved world wide renown.<br />The film is short on dialogue because Friedkin chooses to tell the story cinematically, and what dialogue is included, is there as part of natural surroundings. The characters are not acting on the stage for the audience, they are dealing with and are reacting to each other.<br />Among this films's many strengths is that it is shot on location and does not have the feel of a stage production. Sorcerer is a naturalistic filming at its best that shows both, how man can triumph over the environment through endurance and inventiveness, and it also shows how trials can rehabilitate and beautify character. Friedkin does a marvelous job illustrating this point with Scheider's moral transformation in the end, when he helps the cleaning woman off the floor. The film's abrupt ending isjarring, unrealistic, an afterthought and no doubt an influence of Friedkin's past horror films.<br />Friedkin focuses on off the road driving as his dramatic stage, at a time when SUV's were not yet invented and such driving was not a form of rugged recreation, but dangerous necessity. In the real world it could have been life saving medicines for an isolated tropical region for valuable cargo, as to the road hazards, it could have been anything from flash floods and avalanches in mountainous regions to the attack aircraft on the Ho Chi Mihn trail.<br />The trucks are represented quite poetically in this film, almost like the sentinent beings in their quiet menace and restrained power. Men driving them are mere bugs by comparison as they try tricking each other and grovel over as yet unattained spoils, even as the trials of the journey are about to transform and destroy them.<br />This spiritual dimension of the film is added to by the ultra modern for its day music score by Tangerine Dream, a CD that holds its ground even today as solidly original electronic music. If this film was a commercial failure, then it must have been a marketing failure, because this is one great film however you look at it.to transform and destroy them.<br />This spiritual dimension of the film is added to by the ultra modern for its day music score by Tangerine Dream, a CD that holds its ground even today as solidly original electronic music.

B00005RY7X|5.0|&quot;I Get Wet&quot; does one simple thing, that very few rock albums these days even bother to attempt...  it f'n rocks!  Andrew W.K. unleashes his off-the-wall brand of heavy punk metal via his newest addition to popular music.  This album is about rocking and having a good time...  no hidden agenda, no bells and whistles...  just a longhaired metal head in a white t-shirt with matching jeans.  Rock on, Andrew, (sniffles) rock on.
6300251616|4.0|In the beginning was science fiction of Jules Verne and Herbert Wells (of the time machine fame). They mostly explored the possibilities of the future through the lense of the scientific achievement. Then came the thirties with their pulp fiction printed in cheap magazines and the romance of war and love against the backdrop of outer space that we now regard as Space Opera. Thanks to that heritage of ours, almost everything that Hollywood would serve up Sci-Fi on the screen these days, from Star Wars to Buck Rogers, would be miore appropriately called space opera. There are exceptions, of course; we have Space Odyssey and the Fantastic Voyage (which almost escapes the clutches of the cold war in favor of pure scientific pursuit were it not for Donald Pleasance attempting to sabotage the effort!), and then there is the Sark Star.<br />While it was inspired in part by Dr. Strangelove, and has the campy feel of a low budget film, the picture is a John Carpenter original showing off his quirky humor. From the beginning we don't know if our militarized space cadets are adrift in space or in the sea of a mammouth bureaucracy. Yes, there is a talking smart bomb that experiences some deep philosophical issues, but who can blame it when thed computer that controls it has its wires crossed? The spacemen are there to make the universe safe for settlement by destroying the unstable planet, and they succumb in the end due to a breakdown in communications, which is at the heart of most major disasters.<br />For a change the film feels like classic science fiction, we have men in space, as opposed men on a battleship fighting a battle, that happens to be in space. Most of the themes present in classical sci-fi are addressed in this film - Man vs Outer Space, Man dealing with effects of extended space travel, Man vs Machine, and even the etiquette of dealing with the alien life forms is addressed in this neat little sci-fi farce that no self-respecting fan of sci fi ought to miss.
B00005OAIE|5.0|im a college freshman. . . and the first time i heard this cd my roommate was playing it in our room, and i made fun of him for it.  well, he didn't give up and after a couple more times through i started singing along.  the first day after i returned from school i went out and bought this album.  be careful-- once you listen to it you're hooked.  this cd should come with a warning label.
B0000009RX|3.0|This album is strangely addictive, which is funny for me, being such a psychedelic freak; a bit ironic', really, for me to have bought this album( on vinyl, even). I think I took this album too seriously(lyrically, that is), the first time I listened to it. The second or third time I listened, it was easier to listen To, because I was at ease. the First time I listened to it I was decyfering whether going to get it and everything was worth puting before everything else, or not. In the end, it Was worth it. My advice is: buy and listen to it, Worry Free. I don't know. Maybe that's Just Me. It has interesting voice effects that gives it(ironically) an almost psychedelic edge. Maybe That's part of the mockery, maybe not/maybe just a coincidence. The vinyl version album cover truely Is the Sgt. Pepper vinyl album cover turned inside out and parodied( I don't Care if that's not a word). What I-I-I think they should of done was design the vinyl album cover tO wHeRe you could fold it inside out, but that probably would have cost a little too much money to accomplish. \\"Bow Tie Daddy\\" offers some relief of all the negativity. It put All my worries behind. Maybe it will have the same effect on You. I will say this: this album is, in fact, good enough to give you chills; good enough to give Me chills anyway. In My opinion, the lyrics to,\\"What Is The Ugliest Part of Your Body?\\"( what is, I Guess, the Chorus to the song) are Perfect for Bitter Chicks(I know of one or two). Aside from That, some of the lyrics to the Same song are really inSightful. I felt almost as if the laughter, on what I think is the last track, was mocking Me, Personally!-especially when I realized it was darn(you know what word I Really wanted to use) near the Way the album Ends! I got over it. Warning: if your Like Me, the comment the girl makes on this album about \\"Flower Power\\" may, indeed, rub you... the WRONG WAY. You honestly May be better off getting another one of there albums, like,\\"Overnite Sensation(it's not so Harsh, lyrically, that is).\\" THIS ending quote Should give you an idea of what to Expect from this particular album, taken, of coarse, From the album:\\"Every town must have a place where phony hippies meet. Psychedelic dungeons poping up on every street. GO TO SAN FRANCISCO...\\"
B00005Q3TZ|2.0|...The writing in Pearl Harbor just plain stinks.<br />Early on in this movie, there's an expository scene involving the Japanese high command. They're planning the attack, and they've got a problem -- torpedos won't run in waters as shallow as Pearl's. So, this group of military planners go out to a public park to consider things. (We know it's a public park, because there's a family in the distance flying a kite.) First they consider some wooden fins designed to make the torpedos run shallower -- a real historical detail! Then they stand around a sort of huge plannnig board. On one side of the diagram is a line drawing of a torpedo. It's a picture you might have drawn in third grade: a long tube with fins on one end. From the nose of the torpedo, this diagram has an arrow. The arrow goes down under some wavy lines -- water, again drawn as a child might illustrate it -- and it points to the side of a ship. Ooooh, those dastardly Japanese, they've got a trick up their sleeves... \\"Okay,\\" say the planners, \\"that may just work -- let's go.\\" And by this time, I'm wondering: aren't they going to have to have those kids with the kite killed later? This \\"plan\\" isn't much of a secret -- American spies may just have smoked that torpedos were for sinking ships by 1941 or even earlier -- but for the sake of the plot, aren't we supposed to think it's all pretty hush hush? Why is it taking place in this sunny park?<br />But don't worry, this movie is so dumb, you'll stop worrying about things like that. It's also offensive. His military advisors stumped by the dire situation after Pearl, FDR lurches to his feet, admonishing his people that if HE can stand, THEY can plan a daring raid. Anyone with any sense of what Roosevelt was like, of the spirit FDR showed in living with the effects of his polio, will cringe at that scene. I had just read Doris Kearns Goodwin's popular biography of FDR and Eleanor during the way, and I found it humiliating to watch that.<br />One could go on. Let's just say this is the sort of movie where, when one of the Japanese soldiers gets shot with a pistol, he dies immediately. When a good guy gets hit, it takes ten rifle shots to bring him down, and then he lies on the ground, gasping out his last farewells while all his buddies -- suddenly oblivious to the swarming Japanese patrols they've been running through for five minutes -- gather to listen. What a crock. Don't even ask how they got that coffin back at the end, okay?<br />This movie was half an hour of unrealistic digital effects -- planes banking impossibly with their wings half an inch above the tarmac, and so on -- with two and a half hours of atrociously bad writing around them. The love story was trite and dull. The digital effects just keep getting bigger without ever convincing you of anything. You could write a pretty decent scene about two lovers looking at a monogrammed napkin from the Queen Mary and talking about their futures together; here we get a digital version of the ship itself, stupendous in scale, and it means nothing.<br />Um, it's pretty dang bad.Let's just say this is the sort of movie where, when one of the Japanese soldiers gets shot with a pistol, he dies immediately.

B00005OWEG|3.0|I'm glad I bought the original theatrical version DVD of Apocalypse Now!  I loved that film.  Now I have seen the Redux version and I can't see any improvement whatsoever by the added material.  A few more minutes with Kilgore & Kurtz was okay.  Kilgore though was just more of the same, and while the extra business with Kurtz clarified Willard's time of imprisonment, it also made Kurtz less of an enigma.  Well, I like enigmas!    Now, the added material with the Playboy bunnies and the French Plantation was ridiculous.  Apocalypse was never a realistic movie, but more a fever dream, delirious and poetic and weird.  But these two extended scenes contributed nothing to the story and the Playboy bunny scene was a reiteration of chaos and lack of command that would be repeated at the last bridge outpost.  Redundancy.  The French Plantation while beautifully photographed (nothing new here, the entire movie is stunningly shot)to convey a ghostly image, is poorly acted and has some of the most inept dialogue in the film.  It too adds nothing.    If you see the documentary Coppola's wife made about the actual filming of Apocalypse now, you see the young Francis dissatisfied with the French Plantation and accordingly cutting it.  I trust that Francis Ford Coppola's sense better than the older man now, who probably could use a few bucks for the Napa Winery or whatever.    No, I prefer the movie I saw originally.  That wound its way straight up https://www.wellsfargo.com/ river into Kurtz's nightmarish world without bounds & limits...hell all too present on earth. The Horror.  There were only occasional side-trips and the narration as well as the narrative flow of images was uninterrupted.    So, I ask myself why?  Does Francis Coppola (whose work I cherish) really think this is a better picture than the one his younger self cut?  Or, did he decide he could use a few bucks and everyone was always curious about what he left out?  I don't know and don't care.  I'll keep the older flick and let this one pass.  3-1/2 to 4 stars for this one, 5 for the original.    PS I hope this kind of later fiddling with great pictures doesn't become a habit.
B000060P79|5.0|This CD is awesome in every sense of the word.  Songs like &quot;Worst Day Ever&quot; and &quot;I'm Just A Kid&quot; are definitely something teens my age to relate to.  My personal favorite-&quot;I'd Do Anything,&quot; the ultimate upbeat punk love song.  It features vocals by Mark Hoppus. the bassist from punk giants Blink-182.  I have honestly never heard an album this honest and this pure.  I can totally relate to almost every song, and it's a great sound to hear at the end of a long day.  I highly recommend it.
0061040967|5.0|...Pratchett books are too short.  This (sigh!) is the<br />shortest of the lot.  Other than that, of course, it's<br />marvelous.<br /> We last met Cohen the Barbarian and his antique<br />superheroes when they conquered the Counterweight Continent<br />in _Interesting Times_.  With nothing left to conquer, they<br />give up the easy life that has already taken one of their<br />number.  They are going to climb Cori Celesti, the impossibly<br />high central spire of Discworld, and return fire to the gods<br />- in the form of a barrel of gunpowder.  The resulting<br />explosion in Dunmanifestin, the godly city, will destabilize<br />the entire world.<br /> To stop them, Unseen University is launching an<br />experimental ship, powered by belching mini-dragons, off the<br />edge of the Disc.  Designed by Leonard of Quirm, its orbital<br />path should land it on the mountain in time to stop the<br />attack.<br /> Once again, Pratchett takes the ridiculous and raises it<br />to the sublime.  Truckle the Uncivil, Boy Willie, and Mad<br />Hamish (in his wheelchair) can't take on the gods!  But when<br />they do, we'll learn something about how to remember real<br />heroism.  The terrified minstrel dragged along behind Caleb<br />the Ripper and grandmotherly war-maiden Vena the Raven-haired<br />learns how to write a song remembered forever.  Leonard of<br />Quirm, the innocent super-genius, can design an possible<br />flying machine in his head, but stands in awe, painting the<br />grandeur he views from space.<br /> There is clearly some Pratchett soul in Leonard, and<br />Rincewind the Wizzard, and even in Evil Harry Dread (the last<br />Dark Lord).  Likwise, Paul Kidby has contributed part of his<br />being to everything from group shots of the gods, to the<br />masterful turtle-elephants-Disc views, to the dozens of<br />(Leonardo de Vinci) fantasy/technical drawings of dragon-<br />powered aircraft and self-filling ink quills.<br /> This is a marvelous book to thevery last page - Kidby<br />gives us rubies sprouting flowers in the snow.  Pratchett<br />gives us an immortal saga on a lyre made from a skull and<br />broken wires, about five heroes who weren't sure they were<br />dead.  (Well, if you're not sure, steal the flying horses of<br />the Valkyries who come for you and head for other worlds.)<br />\\"No one remembers the singer.  The song remains.\\"
B00005JKED|4.0|I don't know if this is the way it works, but if it is, it's scary in its own right.  Denzel Washington's character is smart, mean and selfish.  He plays folks from both sides of the line to his advantage.  This movie is full of violence and double crossing and it continues on a straight line through all the perceived turns.  Denzel's character is mean from the beginning, you just don't see it.  He is the true meaning of the word 'player'.  He manipulates everyone around him. <br />The movie leaves you thinking throughout, is he a good guy gone bad?  A good guy trying to help?  Or a bad guy posing as a good one?  <br />Denzel does a find job (one of his best but his absolute best?)and Ethen Hawke does an extraordinary job as the rookie on his first day, the &quot;training day&quot;.  With a cameo by Tom Berrenger and a small part for Scott Glenn this movie is cutting. <br />Take notice though - in the final scene the van disappears!  Watch and you'll understand.
B000002MJ0|5.0|I think that this work is better than &quot;loveless&quot;. If we consider that &quot;isn't anything&quot; was released 3 years before &quot;loveless&quot;...Loveless only complete the ideas erupted out from &quot;isn't anything&quot;. By the way...MBV were,are,will be a fantastic group.The history is made up by people like this...
0060278234|5.0|Garth Nix yet again creates such a book that contains absolutely amazing details.<BR> At first this book may not be that appealing to you, but you really should continue on into the 1st chapter as the prologue is very mysterious and confusing at first so you might take it that the book wont be that good. But it is quite the opposite. <BR> This book was made with SO much detail and was elaborately pieced together in such a wonderful framework of imagination, it is completely mind blowing. I would definately recommend this book to mostly teenagers, and those who enjoy an awsome fantasy read! I am definately sure that the conclusion of the books, Abhorsen, will be yet even better! Cant wait for that one to come out.<BR>             @-}--Raksha K.
B00005RHGL|3.0|A very entertaining move, but lacked any historical value.  Hollywood needs to learn how to entertain and be historically correct.  The &quot;Cowboys&quot; were so glamourized they were beyond believable.  However, Val Kilmer was the best and most acurate Doc Holiday to date.  No one knows what really happened in Tombstone, but this tale was a bit tall.
B00005QDW1|2.0|Like many of No Doubt's fans, my attention was snagged with the 1995 release \\"Tragic Kingdom.\\" I was so impressed with \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" that I actually purchased the 2 previous releases (\\"Beacon St. Collection\\" and \\"No Doubt). I anticapted the release of \\"Return of Saturn\\" and even waiting for my local music store to open so I could purchase it.  I was a little disappointed to hear \\"Return of Saturn\\" but being a dedicated fan, I was willing to go with the band's vision.  However, after purchasing \\"Rock Steady\\" (despite negative reviews) I realized that the band just isn't the same No Doubt that I fell in love with.  I realize that bands have to change and evolve, but I don't think that No Doubt has evolved for the better.  \\"Rock Steady\\" is a decent CD and I do listen to it on occasion, it just isn't of the No Doubt quality that I expected. At least with \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" there was some message to the songs (for example: \\"Just A Girl\\" - sexism) but the songs on \\"Rock Steady\\" are pointless and absurdly sugary sweet Britney Spears ...
B00005MP58|5.0|Jane Austin tends to fare well when translated to the screen.  There must be a nice respect for the author, that people tend to be both careful and faithful.  Costume dramas are always nice to look at, but preserving the essential Austin dialog gives it that extra bite.<br />&quot;Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (1996)&quot; is a lovely, funny, romantic presentation of a classic English novel.  In terms of eye candy, the estates are grand, both inside and out, and the costumes are appropriately beautiful.  The BBC definitely delivers when it comes to presenting England's splendors.  The actors are all perfectly cast, and each delivers and outstanding performance.  Collin Firth is excellent as the brooding Mr. Darcy.  Alison Steadman and Benjamin Whitrow are a constant source of amusement and wit as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet.  Julia Sawalha as Lydia plays the exact opposite of her Absolutely Fabulous character Saffron.  Jennifer Ehle is really the perfect Elizabeth Bennet.  There is a lot to be said for &quot;a pair of fine eyes.&quot;<br />The DVD presentation is really superior for these types of shows.  With such fantastic scenery, a widescreen presentation is necessary.  The Special Edition fixes many errors present in previous offerings.  Just try to put in the first disk, and not watch all six hours straight through!
B00005RY7X|5.0|All the songs sound the same, but Andrew said that was the point.  In a time where all bands put out songs that sound the same, at least this band has a fun atmosphere and lots of energy which makes them different from all the other junk that's out there in the rock world.
B00003CXI1|5.0|As in all good against evil movies, our heros win against evil in the world of scorcerers and witches.  Wow!  What a  game! Quidditch, what an imagination the author had. So fast paced and interesting.  Loved Haggard.  Great movie!  It kept the adults in this family interested.  I say thumbs up and can't wait for the next on to come out.<br />...
B00005RY7X|5.0|This album is the most fun and rocking thing ive heard in a very long time. Its one of the only CDs I own that I can listen to the whole way through without skipping anything. Its just that good. This album is heavy, fast, furious, and fun all at the same time. I would suggest it to ANYONE who wants to expand there horizons and listen to something new.
B00005RY7X|5.0|There is only one thing i could say about this CD.It ROCKS.I listen to a lot of heavy metal but this album makes you want to bang your head.I first saw the video on Mtv and i said to my self i want that CD.
B00005RY7X|4.0|From the opening few chords of 'It's Time to Party', it is clear that Andrew WK has a eutopian vision of FUN!! The lyrics cry out equality: fun (and parties) being something to unite the whole world! <br />To me this album is about equality, WK suggesting an alternative ideolgy to the dissillussioned. Even songs without the word 'party' in them have a sense of energy, but one that is not being forced on you.<br />When I first heard this album I was pleased with my purchase, now I am overjoyed: This album is a rallying call to anyone who likes fun...
B00005QGAX|5.0|Wow what an awesome CD. This Is Michaels best work.And now it's even better because it's been remarsted with extra tracks. This guys a really amazing artist. My favourites are Smooth Criminal which has the most fantastic beat that you can't resist dancing to, Just good friends is a really fun lively track and Liberian girl is a mysterious one which makes me think of the middle east somewhwere. Dirty Diana is great to listen to and easy to follow. I reccomend you buy this CD along with Michael Jackson HISTORY, they're simply must have cd's with some of the best music ever. Even if your'e not a fan and just enjoy good intelligent music you wil like this CD. It's irresistable GO GET IT! I'm a new fan of him and am amazed at his dancing and music abilities.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Amazing. People nowadays sing all day about love, hate and life. What about fun? why cant music be fun. You have the emo lot who enjoy the sad, depressing side of music who aim to cry at the end of a song ( what a stereotype ). You got the political side of music, always arguing with world leaders and every -ism word you can think of.  Then you got the lot who ryhme about what bad boys they are and cuss every other word.<BR>This how ever is a breathe of fresh air. More like a gulp of fresh air, Striking you down with tracks like party till you puke and I get wet.  This album is one of favourites. People say he is unoriginal, but have u heard music like this? I dont think so!
B00005N83M|5.0|That's not what J.Lo says on \\"Play,\\"but amazon.com wouldn't print the real words on my review.I love this CD.There's so many hits from the record after a year,and there still comming.My favorite is \\"Ain't It funny.\\"I also love the ballad,\\"Secretly,\\" and the Spanish closing number,\\"Si Ya Se Acabo.\\"Every song has a different sound,and I can honestly say I want to play \\"My Mothers favorite CD,\\"over and over again.
B000056NX5|1.0|The new version of JCSS achieves something I thought impossible: it makes the old, wooden Norman Jewison version look pretty good.<br />Let's be positive. Renee Castle provides a much needed lift to the show in her interpretation of Mary Magdalene. She sings her numbers with intelligence, feeling, and sincerity. If it hadn't been for her, the whole thing would have been a wash.<br />Not so Glenn Carter in the role of Jesus. He comes off as a rehash of Donny Osmond's Joseph, with none of the charm of that production. (Come to think of it, some of the sets look like they were borrowed from Joseph too.)  His acting is shallow, his singing is mediocre, and his main insight into the role seems to be, &quot;Gee whiz, Ma, I'm in a musical.&quot; In fact, the only thing he succeeds in convincing you of is that pretty-boy rock singers should not be given adult parts. By the time we reached the flogging scene, I was ready to whack him too, just to wipe the stupid smile off his face. And listen to how he goes flat when he tries for high notes! Maybe that's why the rest of the cast sounded so uncharacteristically sincere when they were shouting, &quot;Crucify him!&quot;<br />Jerome Pradon's Judas is only marginally better. At least he manages to sing in tune. But he spends the first half of the show sadistically sneering, and then leads up to his suicide by whining like a two year old and folding up into a fetal curl. Flog him, too. Pradon did show a glimmer of humanity during the Last Supper, but it didn't last very long, and his reappearance to do a full-sneer interpretation of the theme song was just embarrassing. It's too bad, because he seemed like he might actually be an engaging performer if he had a director who knew what she was doing.<br />In the supporting roles: Caiaphas sounds (and dresses) like Mr. T;  Pilate (in a Gestapo uniform--how original!) sounds like he's spent too many years doing bad-guy voices for children's cartoons. The compassion that Pilate is supposed to show before the sentencing was well beyond his emotional range. Meanwhile, the Roman guards look like Darth Vader, and the apostles are so out of place in their roles, they couldn't sell Bibles to Baptists.<br />What was director Gale Edwards thinking? How did she miss the fact that Judas is the main character in the show, not Jesus? How did she miss the fact that audiences need at least one character they can sympathize with? For that matter, how did she miss all the delicious sarcasm in the apostles' song during the Last Supper (absolute deadpan!)? And why did she put up with such plodding tempos for most of the numbers?<br />If you want a decent JCSS, get the original London cast album with Ian Gillian in the title role. At least that version has drama, musicality, and believability, all noticeably lacking in this one.
0446677450|2.0|This book is almost an entire contrast to the MUCH BETTER BOOK The Millionaire Next Door by Tom Stanley.  How on earth can Mr. Kiyosaki imply that people should wait to buy a house until they can pay cash?? Who can actually do this?  Also, he implies that a college education is not important in order to achieve wealth.  Does he know that Dr. Stanley has done the research and has shown that less than 25% of all millionaires in the U.S. do not have 4 year degrees?  The only reason I didn't give this book 1 star is because I agreed with him on the importance of cashflow from investments.  Stick to Stanley, he has actually done the research.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This cd is totally rad and everyone needs to go buy it.....it rocks my socks....i saw him live and he was amazing so i bought this cd and it is one of the best cds i have bought this year...so go buy it NOW!!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I just so happened to stumble upon Norah Jones while watching her performance on the David Letterman Show, and I fell in love with her music immediately. This is a great CD for those who are waiting for Sarah McLachlan's next album since Norah's beautiful voice and piano playing reminds me so much of Sarah (at least in my opinion!) Norah's sound is a bit more soulful and jazzy, and it's absolutely beautiful. This CD is great lounge music...very cool to listen to if you've set aside a day to just relax and, yes, lounge around! Norah Jones is just one of those artists who you are so glad you've found in your record store and you just know she'll have an amazing career...this CD is a must for any fan of Sarah or anyone looking for a great CD to listen to after a long day.
B000002U82|5.0|After listening to this album about 100+ times in my life, I can simply say this: you have to experience this album for yourself. Each listen sounds as refreshing as the last: every song leaves an indelible imprint on your mind. There aren't really any words to describe &quot;Dark side of the Moon&quot; musically; the music is so revolutionary and mind-blowing, with its precise use of sound effects, vocal techniques, and skilled songwriting by the group. If you compare &quot;Dark Side&quot; to the albums released during its time, you can be amazed at how far Pink Floyd pushed the envelope with this album.<br />Now it may sound like im just kissing up to the band or I have a biased opinion because I'm a Pink Floyd fan, but for those who haven't gotten into the band, this is where you should start. It may take a couple of listens, as it did with me, but I am definitely not sorry I bought this album. BUY BUY BUY!
B000001G1E|5.0|That song would be Mother Popcorn! (first song on disk 3). I'll never forget the first time I heard it, and I still play it a couple of times every week. Never heard a band that played so tight and disciplined and yet with such playfullness and musical talent. Buy this now, the best gift you can give yourself or your friends.
B00004X0ER|5.0|These guys sound like their record collection stopped in 1979--and that's a compliment! Sure, it's retro and owes a lot to earlier bands (but, EVERYBODY owes something to SOMEBODY in rock and roll. You think some of the reveiwers above would be happy the Hives are influnced by Iggy rather than Christopher Cross or The BackStreet Boys!)This is a non-stop shot of a hard charging garage punk with the hooks of the great old days of the form. Buy it!
B00005RY7X|5.0|This is one of the best albums I have heard in a long time.  Metal has come back, and its name is Andrew W.K.  These songs get me moving, and remind me of those days of head banging and having fun.  Metal has waited for a long time for this album, and it has finally arrived.  Everyone should own this ablum.  The songs rule, the lyrics are well done and have many meanings.
B000059ZLH|5.0|This DVD is totally amazing. This footage is great because almost like a real show. The sound sounds like a ton of bricks. (Just hear the bass drum in your subs!) Caption is nice too... no image processing, just the show as we were there (unless a few scenes where see the projections on the back of the stage). Also, there is other songs (like a Change of Seasons) as bonus material. Also, there is a lot of pictures took during tour.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This is perfect. It's filled with energy. Great melodies. Hard slamming guitars. Every song is a masterpiece. I mean it.
0783225733|5.0|I First Saw Apollo 13 In The Movie Theaters In 1995 And I Was The First To Get A Copy Of That Very Same Movie On Vhs But With Dvd Takeing Over It's Wirth It
B0000668IF|5.0|Chalk up another one for Moby - I purchased this yesterday and have listened through three times - I love this album.  The thing that attracts me to Moby's works is the obvious intelligence and thought that goes into his recordings and sampling - this guy has listened to a lot of music and knows his history!  Moby - I sure appreciate your efforts - it was worth the money.
B00003CXE7|4.0|I went into this movie with expectations for what it was. An action flick with great battle sequences and enough story to fill the gaps. I was not expecting a complicated storyline just enough substance to keep my interest. I cannot believe Russell Crowe received Best Actor from this film, but oh well.<br />What this movie did have was incredible cinematography and top flight action sequences. The initial battle in Germania was amazingly shot. As was the first battle in the coliseum with the chariots. I did find myself losing concentration at times in between the battles, but very much enjoyed the movie never-the-less.
B00005YW4H|5.0|It's a pleasant surprise to buy a cd that doesn't require skipping certain tracks to enjoy. The only problem I see is that I could have had a few more songs to chill to ...I just make sure the &quot;continuous play&quot; mode is set, and I'm good for several hours. Truly original voice and seamless fusion of jazz and a bit of country (and I don't tend to like country) make for a unique vibe that stands out from the rest of  the music scene.
B00005JKCF|2.0|When I first heard that my favorite animated superhero was coming to life, I could hardly wait for the release date.  I looked forward to seeing Tobey Maguire (one of Hollywood's greatest at the moment) portray the web-slinging / wall-climbing friendly neighborhood Spider-man.  Although his performance as Peter Parker by day, Superhero at night is right up there with any he has done, I was disappointed in the movie as a whole!  The story line, even though true to the comic book and animated series, was too predictable and put me to sleep.  I wish there would've been more twists in the plot or maybe an attempt for movie producers to create their own.  Although my disappointment will not deter me from seeing the obvious sequel, I do hope that more effort is put into entertaining true fans.
B00005TT77|1.0|A friend of mine has asked me to review this album. He says it's a complete sacrilegy. And the best tribute to the beatles would be to remove this album from the market.
B00003CXI1|3.0|I enjoyed the film a lot and I expected a lot from the DVD (also considering the fact that WB boasts that the DVD will be unlike any other), but, I have to say, I was a bit disappointed with it. The film was fine, except, of course, the lack of audio commentary by the Director/Producer or the actors themselves. It was the second disc that bugged me a lot. <br />I was lead to believe that there are tons of behind-the-scene flicks and production notes on the bonus disc but, to my horror, there weren't many. Oh, sure, there are the deleted scenes (which they didn't even incorporate to the film, unlike what Star Wars the Phantom Menace did) and an interview with the Director, Producer and Script Writer, but aside from those, the extras were really lame. You have to \\"play\\" your way around the disc in order for you to view the deleted scenes which is an original concept, but, quite frustrating after several turns. There are your screensaver, game demos, remembrall, potion-challenge and your virtual tour of Hogwarts (which was quite good but still lacking). <br />Anyway, I was hoping to get a glimpse of the usual stuff--production notes, behind-the-scenes, interview with the actor, audition clips, costume design, creature design, the CG of Harry Potter, outtakes, etc. Stuff that really mattered. I wanted to get a glimpse of what it was to be on the set of Harry Potter, the opinion of the actors, anything about the MOVIE ITSELF. But what I got is a compilation of flash-type games that are not only annoying, but quite a nuance as well. One word summary: gimmicky.<br />Sorry Harry. The only reason I gave it three stars is that I'm a big HP fan. If not for that, I'd probably give it a 2 or a 1.
B000001EC1|5.0|It has all of Bon Jovi's Greatest hits on it.  i reccomend this and One Wild Night Live!<br />                     NEW JERSEYANS RULE
B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew W.K.'s debut CD 'I Get Wet' features some of the most refreshing and energetic music I've heard since a very long time. Andrew knows exactly how to motivate people through his  raging guitars and up-tempo songs. The best CD to get your adrenalin flowing before going to a party! DO WHAT EVER YOU WANT! NEVER LET DOWN! LIFE IS TOO SHORT! NO REGRETS!<BR>LIVE HARD!
B000002ADT|5.0|This 1959 recording is a true work of art. It also features John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderly.Despite diverse playing styles, all musicians blend perfectly and their musicianship cannot be questioned on this recording.  Perfect Springboard for anyone who wants to start listening to jazz this is the one to get is very smooth and romantic. It is also perfect if youre with the one you love on a beautiful afternoon.
B000002BUY|5.0|S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is an amazing album, featuring not only metal, but funk, DJ, and even a little jazz. Out of modern artists, Incubus is my favorite, and S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is my favorite album of theirs. Songs like &quot;Redefine&quot; and &quot;Vitamin&quot; can really get you pumped, although the lyrics are hard to understand. &quot;New Skin&quot; and &quot;A Certain Shade of Green&quot; are the best, followed by &quot;Favorite Things&quot; and the smooth, jazzy &quot;Summer Romance (Anti-Gravity Long Song)&quot;. It's only a shame DJ Lyfe had to leave. I'd buy it if I were you. The bonus track is also pretty funny...
B00005RRG9|5.0|Though Disney has a reputation for ruining movies, in this case, the only case, they made a winner out of this american version of &quot;Das dobbelte Lottchen&quot;. It is of course widely different from the original as the settings have been completely transferred to the US, it is almost like watching a completely new movie. And Hayley Mills is doing a really good job at playing both twins.<BR>I can highly recommend it, even to those of you familiar with the original German story. It has lost nothing in Disney's hands.
B000066C1N|5.0|I was really impressed with this CD. I was excited from the beginning, when I heard Bryan Adams was doing the music and Hans Zimmer was doing the score. I got all that I wanted when I listened to the CD for the first time.<BR>It's set up much like the &quot;Road to El Dorado&quot; CD is: all the lyrical songs and then a few selections from the score. The theme of the movie, &quot;Here I Am&quot; is a really great song with a good beat. Bryan Adams' duet with Sarah McLauchlan for &quot;Don't Let Go&quot; is an exceptionally beautiful song and one of my favorites. &quot;Get Off Of My Back&quot; (the song heard in many of the previews) is great as well. I'd say the song I dislike the most is &quot;You Can't Take Me&quot;, but I don't hate it enough to skip over it every time.<BR>There are 4 selections from the movie's score on this CD, and they're all great. Hans Zimmer has always written great scores for animated films, and this is no exception.<BR>I'd say my only complaint is the quality of the picture on the back of the case; you can practically count the pixels. But that's hardly a reason to lower the rating.<BR>If you like Bryan Adams, I can pretty much guarantee you'll enjoy this CD!
B00005RY7X|5.0|I first saw Andrew W.K.'s video for \\"Party Hard\\" and immediately I knew I was going to buy this CD.  Every song on this album gets me pumped up and I love it!  I recommend listening to this album while you're working out and/or driving to work in the morning.<br />I'd describe Andrew's style as \\"80's music mixed with a little metal and 100,000 watts of electricity.\\"  You may find some of the lyrics to be inspiring as well.<br />With \\"I Get Wet\\" in my stereo, nothing can go wrong - Do yourself a favor and get this album!!!
B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew W.K. is by far the most charismatic, energetic and entertaining performers to have come out in a long, long time.  I believe that there is no limit to the success that this superstar will achieve.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This album is indescribable, it is pure genious. It's so different to everything else on the market, it is pure energy, he is pure energy. He lives up to his name with his music and performance. From the catchy lyrics of Party Hard, to the more morbid theme of Ready to Die, it's sheer brilliance through and through. Most definitely recommended.
076790382X|5.0|I bought this book in Germany as the funny part of the preparation of my ~2 year stay in the US (beside serious literature). I found a lot of interesting hints why people in the US are sometimes different to people in Europe (especially in Germany). <br />Bill Bryson is pointing to several things like food, shopping and other problems how to get settled in another country. He made sometimes the same type of experiences that we did.<br />I love this book because it shows things that are totally normal to people in the US but seem strange to people from other countries (e.g. the waste of energy). He does not blame people for what they are, he just shows how they are and tries to explain why.
B000062TU1|3.0|I didn't discover Harry Potter until all of the first four books were already on sale, so I got to read the whole set straight off.<BR>I loved 'em.<br />So what's wrong with the film and the CD?<BR>As far as I can tell, lack of imagination and lack of creative effort.<br />You don't have to completely re-write a book in order to make it into a good visual production - but you do need to have some kind of \\"feel\\" for it.<br />After watching the interviews with the director and the producer it's plain to see that they regard the whole Harry Potter thing as a production line rather than a labour of love - and it shows in the complete lack of any kind of real excitement in the film.<br />To my mind, the best scene in the whole film is Harry's meeting with Voldemort in the woods - and that only lasts a very few minutes.<BR>The rest of the film, as other reviewers have said, is technically faithful to the original text.  And that's about the best you can say of it!<br />The double CD is a joke, the UK website isn't even finished!<BR>(The \\"name your owl\\" feature, for example, is still under construction).  And I'm still trying to find the much publicised \\"never-before-seen footage\\" feature.<br />In short, if you're new to Harry Potter, and preferably under the age of 12, you might really enjoy this package.  Otherwise, I think you're going to just be very glad you didn't pay full price for it!

B000062Y98|5.0|Perhaps I'm a bit biased, considering that Blind Guardian is my favorite band of all time, but really, just listen to this, it doesn't take a brain surgeon to see why this thing is so great.  There's just so much here, lots of vocal tracks, great lyrics, awesome musicianship, even a song in Spanish.  Thomas Stauch really stands out on this album, and why shouldn't he? He is one of the greatest drummers in metal.  Not just fast, but great technique.  There's also a lot of nice guitar and piano on here as well.  If I had to pick a favorite, I'd have to say &quot;Precious Jerusalem&quot;.  Just a great rockin' track, with beautiful vocals.  Many seem to be blown away by &quot;And Then There Was Silence&quot;, calling it their greatest song ever.  Well, it's a good song, but they've surely done better.  It's well-made, but I don't know, something about it just doesn't feel right.  But I still think it's good, so don't call me a heretic!<br />I think this is their second best behind &quot;Nightfall in Middle Earth&quot;, and one of the best albums ever made.  I love nearly all of Blind Guardian's stuff (except for &quot;Follow the Blind&quot; and that weird cover album they did), but they've really raised the bar with &quot;Nightfall..&quot; and this album.  I highly, highly recommend this.  The Queen album of the same name is great too, but not this good.  But, that's not a strike against it, there's almost nothing this good.  I can't really explain why this album is good, you have to hear it for yourself.  Check it out.
0800179501|1.0|I think it needs to be said again --- what's a great movie like this doing only available as a chopped up pan&amp;scan version? Especially considering the lower quality sequels are available widescreen?<br />I really want to buy this movie, but I can't justify buying such a poor DVD that doesn't show the entire movie.
6300213668|5.0|I'm an old fart in my fifties and saw this movie when it first came out.  I saw it about 10 times then at the movie theatre with my wife.  We loved it.<BR>When it came out on VHS several years later, I immediately purchased it.  I have only purchased 5 videos in my life, so that shows how much I liked it.  HOWEVER, when I watched it on the VHS, I was greatly DISAPPOINTED.  A lot of the cool things that John Travolta and the rest do are on the sides of the movie, and they were cut off on VHS!!  If you have never seen this movie at the movie theater, THEN YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT!  It is still enjoyable on VHS, but compared to wide screen, the VHS version is a disappointing dud!<BR>DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT buy this movie on VHS!!  You will be throwing away good money for a dud!  <BR>I cannot understand why this movie has not been put on DVD widescreen.  I guess some studios just don't know their craft.  There are so many movies that have been put on DVD that don't need to be.  Grease NEEDS to be put on DVD widescreen.
B00005Q66T|3.0|I like Madonna, but I am not a Madonna fan. Therefore, I don't usually buy her CD's, but I do like to have the compilations that come out, since they usually have all the songs I like in one CD.<br />Unfourtunatetly, this is not the case with GHV2. It does have some songs I really like, but it has some others that in my opinion could have been substituted by others. I especially would have liked to see American Pie on this CD.<br />Still, it is a good compilation, and if you are a fan I am sure you will love it.<BR>If you are like me, you might want to check the songs included a few times before buying it.<br />All in all, Madonna is Madonna, and since these songs had been previously released, there are no surprises, just good old Madonna songs!
B00003CXXP|4.0|This movie really can only work if you take a good long look at yourself and your emotions and the way you experience and act on them, and then see the film.  Because I truly don't think that this is a film to get if you just want to be entertained.  Teddy (the robot's talking stuffed-bear) and the special effects aside, it REALLY isn't an entertaining movie...<br />But it raises interesting questions about love.  What is it?  What creates it?  It really is only a feeling, you know?  Why is it more genuine in us than in that robot? Just think... if something feels love, how can it NOT be considered alive?  What is really the difference between a robot and a human at that point?  They're just made of different systems...<br />So if you're willing to get a little philosophical, I'd reccomend this film for sure.  <br />And just to answer to a few of the major complaints I've seen-- yes I agree, this movie was TOO long!  But I thought that the last bit was really good if you're the least bit empathetic with this kid who has wanted his mother for so long... <br />And as for the &quot;aliens&quot; in the end-- I was under the impression that they were highly HIGHLY advanced A.Is!  I think that makes it a WAY more interesting ending than if it's just some creatures who zoom in from nowhere.  No... I think the OH SO superior human race couldn't survive on the earth at somepoint, and the A.Is could and did.  Make sense?
B00005A1PR|5.0|Something happens every single time I put this CD on.... I start DANCING... I just cannot control myself... right now, Im sitting in front of this PC and I can't stop my torso from moving to her rhythm!<br />Also.. watch out for your mood, because this is a GOOD MOOD booster!!!<br />I got this CD after watching the Grammys, I have to admit that although I had heard  India Arie's name before,  I had never heard her music, until that night, and it sounded so real, coming from the heart and the soul, that I needed to get the CD. <BR>I am so happy I did!!!! Her music is not only fun, and highly audible, but it is also very inspiring and dignifying!!!<br />Definetly an excellent CD, with a little bit for everyone. <br />Don't miss out on this one!
B000062XFG|5.0|Some episodes were better than others, but I enjoyed watching them in sequence especially without commercial interruption. The special features are interesting. The quality of the picture and sound is outstanding (compared to TV) and it helped me to become more familiar with how the series and characters evolved. I'm not a Trekkie nor a Techie - I just love TNG characters.
B0000634EV|4.0|Those familiar with Down's epic first album NOLA will undoubtedly find a great deal to like on its followup, \\"A Bustle in Your Hedgerow.\\"  The band's trademark sludgy Southern-style riffs and thick grooves are present on old-school metal tracks like the monstrous opener \\"Lysergik Funeral Procession,\\" \\"New Orleans is a Dying Whore,\\" and \\"Dog Tired.\\"  The abrasive grind of the guitars give the band immense potency on these hard-hitting tracks.  However, beyond the expected nods to Black Sabbath, the band also shows some signs of branching out.  \\"Stained Glass Cross\\" has a somewhat funky sound, and \\"Learn from this Mistake\\" and \\"Where I'm Going\\" slow things down almost to the point of a dirge, with some rather mournful vocals from Phil Anselmo.  Phil is his usual excellent self, with vocals going all over the map from plaintive singing to rousing shouts, and the band behind is in fine form once again.  I don't like this album quite as much as its legendary predecessor, but it's still more than worth your time and money.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is an album that their record label, Reprise, deemed the album unsuitable and didn't want to release.  Thankfully someone at Nonesuch Records, saw the album's first rate quality and released it (Ironically, AOL Time Warner is the parent company to both labels).  While country in essence, the band employs eerie piano riffs, synthesizers and close-mike vocals that have more in common with Radiohead than Merle Haggard.  Wilco leader and lead singer Jeff Tweedy embodies the songs he sings.  On &quot;I'm Trying To Break Your Heart&quot; he sings in a drunken slur that vividly portrays the song's drunk protagonist.  &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot; is a power pop gem that uses jangling guitars that remind one of R.E.M.'s college rock days.  The album is full of glorious and diverse sounds like dobros, brass, synth, steel guitars and various guitar riffs from metal to funk.  Wilco suffered some loses in personnel on this album, but the casualties are worth the price for this brilliant piece of musical stew.
B00005RFAI|5.0|i dont think i can put pink in less then 1,000 words but ill cut it down SOO much you will want to buy it fast.<BR>ok... she isnt your everyday britney or missy elliot. shes right in between leave her own mark. people dont have great lives and love and is happy all the time and never upset. well it seems that all these other artists want to hide behind there cd and say \\"im 100% happy\\" when you TRULY know there life cant be THAT great. pink doesnt lie and make 15 songs about her love life cus its so great.. pink tells you how it is and how it can be sometimes. shes not like \\"my life [is bad] so feel pitty for me\\" shes more like \\"i know what its like.. ill help you out of it\\" and thats how she directs her songs to.<BR>my FAVORITE song would have to be \\"Misery\\" with the lead singer from Areosmith on there.  her voice is just so great on this song.. she hits it and its hard when she sings this song. some other songs i love could be  all of her songs on both albums but some from here off the top of my head would be... \\"dont let me get me\\" \\"respect\\" \\"family portrait\\" and \\"dear diary\\" i think that her other songs \\"gone to cal., numb, lonely girl, eventually, 18 wheeler, gtps, just like a pink and missundaztood\\" are great but those just stick out becuase i can relate soo much.  and if your a pink fan.. look into the  mix \\"get the party started\\" feat Readman. its a great mix.. well as you can tell pinks my all time favorite artist and i give her all my love and i hope her more songs to come! hope i helped.. i might have gone off =]
B00005RY7X|5.0|If you like to party, buy this album. It's that simple. This CD is chock-full of good ol' rock with 12 intense tracks to get your heart pumpin. It's obvious that Andrew W.K. put all of his heart, blood, sweat, and tears (mostly blood and sweat) into this album to make it by far one of the best rock albums of the year. Perfect party CD.

B00003CXTG|1.0|Einmal mehr hat es Hollywood geschafft, den Krieg absolut zu veralbern. Super gut aussehende Ultrahelden unterbrechen ihre Liebesromanzen, um mal eben in einer abenteuerlichen Aktion das Bse zu bekmpfen. Im grauenhaften berfall auf Pearl Habor glnzen sie mit lockerer Flugakrobatik und coolen Sprchen. Der Film reiht sich ein in eine unendliche Anzahl von hollywoodschen Kriegveralberungen, wie es einst schon \\"Das dreckige Dutzend\\" nach dem Motto: 'hier kommen Superhelden mit Endlosmagazinen im Gewehr, denen keine Kugel etwas anhaben kann, solange sie sich nur hinter einer Glasscheibe verstecken knnen.' in allerbester Weise vormachte. Das amerikanische Volk trauert noch heute ber den grausamen, hinterhltigen berfall auf Pearl Habor. Umso trauriger finde ich es, da Hollywood es wagt, die eigene Nation mit deratigen Liebeskriegsfilmen zu beleidigen. Andererseits wird aber auch nur verkauft, was nachgefragt wird. Ohne mich auf andere Urteile zu verlassen, habe ich mir diesen Film angesehen und wurde leider sehr, sehr enttuscht, da ich erwartet habe, da die amerikanische Filmindustrie ein so grausames Geschehnis mit wenigstens einem Mindestma an Ernsthaftigkeit bearbeiten wrde. Leider ist dem ganz und gar nicht so. Ich werde mir diesen Film niewieder ansehen, da er mir nichts einbringt, auer einem sinnlosen Zeitverlust.
B00005RY7X|5.0|this album is slammed packed full of energy something that hasnt been seen in a long time its no wonder the band is now on ozzfest 2002 just put the cd in crank the volume and enjoy
B000063S6Z|5.0|This album tickled my Moby bone in just the right way.  Whatever that means.  It has many similar sounds that I heard on 'Play'.  Even though most of the songs sound much like the 'Play' tunes it still sounds great and the whole CD sounds terrific.  I do wish they were a little more original, but hey, &quot;sequel&quot; CDs are just fine with me
B00005RY7X|5.0|In this day and age when music has become so serious, Andrew WK offers a different sound, a FUN sound. Imagine Rob Zombie's kid brother going through his Ramones and Def Leppard vinyl, mixing the two and screaming on top of it all - that's as good a description as I can come up with for &quot;I Get Wet.&quot;<br />Fun, energetic and catchy, this album bridges the gap between modern rock and the classic hard rock sound some of us grew to love.
0446608955|5.0|I LOVED IT!<br />It was a well written love story which is very rare from a man. But I must warn you that it's a MAJOR TEARJERKER! If you saw the movie, but haven't read the book, the book is WAY better!
B0000027I6|5.0|Amused to Death is so moving.  It's a work of passion that, when taken as a whole, can move you to tears.  Each song is a deep look into humanity, media and things that just make us think about ourselves and the world.  It's 70 minutes of brilliance.  Roger Waters is in perfect form as the songwriter, player, singer, bandleader and, perhaps most of all, satirist.  To me, this album greatly surpasses and previous Roger Waters solo release (all good, incidentally) but  - now this will sound sacrilegious - any Pink Floyd release as well.  Without being - how can I put this - \\"steered\\" by the likes of David Gilmore and the whole Pink Floyd machine, Waters does exactly what he sets out to do on his own terms.  Listen to it.  Listen to the lyrics.  Listen to it - beginning to end - with a good pair of headphones on a good stereo in a darkened room and ALONE.  Listen to everything going on in the background.  It all means something.  There is no single standout.  It all stands out.  It's ironic, humorous, sad, impassioned and poignant.  If you're looking for music without a message that's three minutes long, don't listen to this.  It's not \\"depressing\\", as is often associated with Water's music, it's thought provoking.  The performances by all the musicians - in particular Jeff Beck - are flawless.  They compliment the pieces they play on.  Nothing is out of place.  I couldn't possibly recommend this CD more.

0385484518|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is an excellent book that covers various topics that everyone experiences in life. It makes the reality of death apparent but in a way that most of us don't think about on a daily basis. The book tells us so many important things about life. It shows us what we take for granted and how the things that we make high priorities don't really matter when it comes to the end. The most important thing to get out of the book is that in order to live a rewarding life, you have to be able to give and accept love. When there is no love involved in a person's life, there is really nothing to live for. There is no amount of money or any particular item that can possibly substitute the love that you share with someone close. It is a great book that makes you think about what exactly is going on in your own life and if that will be something beneficial or something that is just kind of passing the time away for no good reason. Everyone should read this book at least once!
B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew W. K. is here to save rock n' roll, and succeds with an incredible disc that lives up to the UK hype. The album pounds with irerepressable energy and a bubblegum heart. It's like a hug between Biohazard and Sugar Ray. And yes, that is better than it sounds.
0767903374|5.0|Foreword:<br />I don't fit into any of the neat categories that people write books (&amp; enneagrams) about.<br />For example, I'm neither a &quot;typical female nor male type&quot;.<br />Women are &quot;supposed to be&quot; easily startled by creepy crawlies (which I am), but they're also &quot;supposedly&quot; more fluent, and more capable than men of smooth transition from one topic to another (which I'm *not*, because I get extremely fazed by constant changes of topic).<br />=====================<br />In a similar vein, re: Highly Sensitive People:<br />I have many of the characteristics of an HSP, but:<br />(1) Prozac had no therapeutic effect on me whatsoever<BR>(2) I'm not artistic<BR>(3) I lack any PSI abilities whatsoever<BR>(4) I'm not all *that* disquieted by noise<BR>and so on...<br />Still, I'm very sensitive to peoples' moods, feelings &amp; atmospheres, cry easily, am an &quot;over-thinker&quot; thus getting overstimulated...<br />So I challenge readers of this review to try and classify me according to any of the literature currently available.<br />And so, I repeat, not everyone can be categorized into a neat package of &quot;clustered tendencies&quot;. Nevertheless, books such as Aron's HSP, and Palmer's Enneagram do provide valuable yardsticks and reference material, despite their not being dyed in the wool.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew W. K. is here to save rock n'roll, with I Get Wet we hear the anti-Kid A, and it is massive. With a sound that has been described as Slayer meets Abba, Andrew W. K. tears down Neo-Grunge and Nu-Metal with a fury that surpasses all. The only fault of this disc is the ommission of We Want Fun, other than that the disc is flawless.
B00005RY7X|5.0|The second I saw the video for &quot;Party Hard&quot; by Andrew W.K., I fell in love.The hard crunching sound blew me off my couch. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Pure genious. I GET WET, in my opinion, is one of the greatest metal albums to be releases since the Black Album by Metallica. Now I would like to take this time to disagree with anyone who says this band sounds like 80's metal. That is totally a false statement. If Andrew W.K. would be 80's metal, he'd be wearing make-up, have hair spray in his hair, and his music wouldn't sound like it does. His music is a mix of late 70's early 80's punk. It packs that huge punch and that roaring speed that bands like The Clash and the Ramones did back then. The lyrics I must say, are very impressive. To have the balls that Andrew does to go out and play his heavy hard hitting music, and then add lyrics to it about having a good time and just letting loose, takes not only some originality, but also some talent. Plus, to add classical piano to the heavy guitar riffs of his band, also adds to the increadible sonic rush that you get with the final product. My favorite songs on the album are &quot;She is Beautiful, and &quot;It's Time to Party.&quot; Pure greatness. To pass up buying this album is like starving yourself. For once in my life, at the end of an album, not only did I want to go party, but it made me smile. It made me happy. Andrew...thank you for putting something out there that everyone can listen to.
B00003CWPR|5.0|even though Kubrick died before having the opportunity to finish editing the film it has his telltale marks and brilliance .... <br />The movie was based on an erotic mini story by a German author, and, with all the naked women in the movie it's definitely male oriented erotica. Tom Cruise plays a very married and comfortable DR William Grtford and the movie starts with his wife, Nicole, informing him that no, contrary to his belifs, married women such as she do have erotic dreams and desires for men other than their husbands. <br />Of course our hero is highly disturbed by this confession and enters a night of adventure, intrigue, temptation and debauchery where he is a willing passenger but not participant. The dear naiive DR opens his eyes and in a period of 24 hours gets more sexual and adultrous activity slapped into his face over and over ..... and .... even though at several pints in the film the Dr wants to get a taste of the forbidden events that suuround him leave him frustrated ....<br />If you are a male and enjoy erotic literature the ods are in your favour that you'll love this movie ......

1559409010|5.0|A great Python film, and actually a pro-Christ film.  The film, rather than attack Christ, attacks Christianity.  It never mocks what Jesus says or does, only the foolish things said and done by those who worship Jesus (often while conveniently ignoring much that Jesus said).  In short, this movie attacks the narrow-minded, unimaginative, hostile mess much of Christianity has become, rather than the very compassionate, admirable ideal Christianity was intended (and still claims) to be.  Anyone who complains that this movie is offensive or blasphemous only shows that they have missed the whole point of Jesus, worshipping the messenger without even noticing the message.

B00005A46T|5.0|With intense riffs and mind-bending speed on all levels (guitar, drums, and vocals), and yet still retaining melody and rhythm unlike several other bands, Slipknot truly digs deep into the darkest recesses of your mind to bring about controversy in the realms of sanity, politics, the incomprehensible conformity of society, etc.  Their intense aggression is MUCH to be appreciated.  I mean, damn, who else can put on a show like this?! Definitely 5 stars for metal freaks.
B000002P2W|3.0|This is a bit of an uneven album from a band whose output was consistently uneven.  There are some cracking tracks; in particular &quot;Dreaming from The Waist&quot;, &quot;How Many Friends&quot;, and the two openers.  The sequence of &quot;Success Story&quot; followed by &quot;They are all in Love&quot; and &quot;Blue Red and Grey&quot; is effective.  I really struggle with &quot;Squeeze Box&quot;, &quot;Imagine A Man&quot;, and &quot;In a Hand Or a Face&quot;.  The playing is at all times convincing with the Ox's rumbling bass joining Moon's genuine valedictory performance (the drumming on his final recorded album is perfunctory to say the least), some typically tasty twinkling from Nicky Hopkins (back collaborating after a decade or so) and featuring some well thought out solos from Pete.  I like Pete singing &quot;However much I booze&quot; given its content (Roger refusing to sing this one shows that he isn't quite as thick as he comes across) and Roger's vocals are, well, strong and virile as one would expect after his microphone bursting performance on Quadrophenia.<br />A fine album (which I always stop after the studio tracks), high on the second tier of their output.

B000063S6Z|5.0|Play was the first Moby album i got, and after hearing it for the millionth time i still enjoy its tunes and beats. i just bought 18, and probably one of the best opening songs i have heard, &quot;we are all made of stars.&quot; 18 has 18 tracks, and all are well crafted. if you have never heard Moby before, this is a great start, but getting Play will show you what a great artist Moby is. 18 is a little more mellow than Play, but it achieves what it set out to do: make good music.

B000007O9L|5.0|It may seem at first glance that this would be a truly raw live set raunchier than, say, even \\"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out\\" but in actuality the songs come out very polished. Songs that were produced during periods when the group was less pop-concious, like \\"Sweet Virginia\\" or \\"Shine A Light\\" (both from Exile On Mainstreet [1972]) come out as slick, clean tunes. The set has been titled \\"Stripped\\" but in actuallity this music sounds as crisp and clean as it ever will. Jagger seems to follow the lyrics close enough as opposed to other live sets where he seems to stray, sacrificing lyrical accuracy for glam posturing. Keith and the rest of the band are in top form and sound as good they ever have, and so do the songs. One who is daring might say that most of these songs sound better now than they did upon their original release. Songs like \\"Street Fighting Man\\" that may not seem to be wise candidates for an acoustic-based set are handled well. Nevermind the corny album cover, this is probably the last of the best of The Stones live or otherwise.
B00005K3NR|2.0|Technically, this movie is superb - it's just plain interesting to watch.  The final scenes showing Carrie's descent into monster-dom are terrifying - but, in a way, that's the problem with this movie.  The movie doesn't give you any way to feel about what you're seeing except to notice how well it's made - to be horrified (and maybe a little excited by?) all the mayhem.  King's book is quite different - he played his story as a tragedy; he was going for a sense of sadness at what had happened.  You get the feeling from the book that, although no one is exactly innocent (not even Carrie!), everyone played a part in creating a horrible situation that unexpectedly grew bigger than any one character.  You can't, in other words, reduce the book by blaming Carrie, her mother, the school bullies, etc., since they all only played a role.  In the book, the telekinesis thing is just the catalyst which allows King to meditate on how quickly things spin out of our control - with such disastrous results.  <BR>All DePalma cares about is showing off cool camera techniques - while bullies and those who actually tried to help Carrie are mercilessly killed.  This movie asks nothing of the viewer but to enjoy the technique; King asked us to grieve over the instability of our lives, and the (limited) role we play in it.  The book was better than the movie -  or the DVD, which adds nothing to the original product.
B00005RY7X|5.0|I love the debut album from andrew w.k. It has great sounding songs, I love the beats, and Andrew is so cool! He is the next big thing in music and I hope to see more of him!
B000002U8G|4.0|Meddle is the perfect example of where Pink Floyd's brilliant, revolutionary sound came from. In fact, I consider Meddle to be the first album to really express what would later become the well-known Pink Floyd sound. Up to this point they had been experimenting with psychadelia and orchestration but with Meddle they really found themselves and began performing with all of their magestic talents the way that they always wanted to. Meddle is led to greatness by it's final track, Echoes, which is a 23+ minute epic trip through every emotion known to man. It provokes happiness, fear, sadness, and exhilleration all in one. This album should be credited as the first true Pink Floyd album and will always be one of my favorites.
B00005JKHP|3.0|How is the DVD different that the VHS Director's Edition that's been out for many years?
B00005RY7X|5.0|Take everything fun and wonderful and exciting that's in your life (or maybe not in your life) and put it into an album and you will have Andrew W.K.'s &quot;I Get Wet&quot;. It's a party for your ears with 12 heart-pumping, life-loving, fun-finding songs that make you just want to get up and do something! It's a solid blend of current pop and early 90s rock that's both nu age and nostalgic. Go ahead, try it-- I dare you not to like it!
B000009ED0|4.0|This does Kid Rock justice for his first major CD label debut (he released two to three other CDs before joining Atlantic/Lava records), and it works. The minute I heard his music on MTV (and no, I am NOT a \\"teeny-bopper\\" that likes the \\"in-thing\\"), I loved it. And then the rest of the CD, especially the ballad \\"Only God Knows Why\\", is very much perfect.<br />The only thing that keeps it from a perfect 5? The needing to STILL censor some of his lyrics even though the Paraental Advisory logo is on the cover (listen to the last verse in \\"Cowboy\\" to hear what I mean). If they didn't feel the need to do that, it would be a perfet CD. BUt it's still worth the 15-20 bucks for it.
B00005RY7X|5.0|I can't believe how amazingly complex this album is for something so simple.  It's just gives me a rush everytime i hear it.  Every song surpasses the next, and the first one [It's Time To Party] i'd give a 10.  It's such an uplifting CD and it just gets you going.  Great music to blast at a party, great if your sad and want some cheering up, great for snacking.  Just play it, 24/7, live it, dream it, be it.  BUY IT!
B000002KC5|5.0|Who else has the voice, the melodies and the God-awesome<br />intelligence to create a masterpiece like this other then Randy Newman?<br />There is a certain intellectual threshold needed to really appreciate this man's music. Tender, beautiful melodies with<br />a sort of nostalgic feeling for the workingman's history of the<br />United States.<br />&quot;Louisiana 1927&quot; demonstrates Newman's genius in this particular album more then anything else. If there is one living composer who<br />is creating a musical accompaniment for America's history, it is<br />Randy Newman.
B0000668IF|4.0|I bought the album yesterday and listened to the cd on my way home from work,  the album is awesome,  its Moby at his best.<BR>I love the opening song on the album  We are made of stars,  I keep playing the song over and over.  I definitely recommend buying this cd,  it an album you put on nice and loud on your stereo,  kick back and relax....
B00005JKBC|1.0|The single worst DVD I ever purchased. I had read about the captions in a review here but bought the movie anyway. What were they thinking when they produced this mess. The constant subtitles is a real mistake! Did they think it would resemble a foreign film {heavy sigh}, {no dialogue}.They are not sexy or trendy. This film actually has these annoying and often ridiculus captions throughout the entire film. I spend the initial 20 minutes trying to turn them off. I don't care much for TV shows with canned laughter, but these subtitles are unbelievable and are not wellcomed. A distubing trend perhaps? What was I thinking when I bought an action film with Redford in it? What did I expect? Robert Redford flying around Viet Nam as a CIA operative {hellicopter noise}. Please! He continues to badmouth the Government, the CIA of course and the USA in general. His roll seems to be to continue as a reporter from the Washington Post, as in a previous film. The whole movie has a tone not unlike his previous works. Anti-war, anti-goverment, anti-USA, pro-left wing nonsense permeates the whole production. We already know about unfair government spy tricks. I didn't buy this to have the evils of my government explained to me by this vehicle. I had hoped for something like Three Days of the Condor, but it didn't happen! The only thing I liked in this movie was Redford's sports jacket and blue oxford shirt. Which he apparently wears throughout the whole movie. I stopped watching and could not sit through to the end. I am truly embarrazzed to say I spent [money] on this coaster, a urinal cake target might be a better thought. A terrible film!
B00005QIPH|3.0|In spite of all the praise and hype this CD has received it just comes down to being a good rock and roll album.  While the band takes it's sound from legendary bands such as The Velvet Underground, Television and The Stooges, they are not even in the same league as these bands.  No the Strokes are not the saviors of rock and roll and no this is not the best release of 2001.  This release is WAY over-hyped and the band will probably fall victim to the corporate rock machine, the rock journalists and the fawning mainstream public who have deemed this band a living legend even before their sophomore effort is released.  That being said, there is really nothing new or original here yet it is a great record.  However I have grown tired of the hype and am rapidly loosing interest.  Sometimes we should just let the music speak for itself.  But it's all about selling records isn't it?
B00000JPH6|5.0|This movie is rich and colorful, especially for the time it was made. <br />For those of you who need your CGIs/Animations spoon fed to you...dont bother. You will become one of the small handful who do not like this film.<br />If you can appreciate an artists way, and the ability to bring a good story to life with no computers and also with a scenery that is out of the norm, this is for you.<br />I loved it, my 3 and 5 year old love it.  The darkness is merely a path to a finale which lends credit to the deeper meanings your average complainer loves to bypass.<br />I you hated it, you are just a complainer anyway.
B0000633T6|1.0|This movie would be getting 5-stars from me if it wasn't for the damn closed captioning popping up.  I've read other reviews, and it seems other people are having similar problems.  I have a Toshiba SD-1600 so maybe it is a Toshiba-specific problem.  I emailed Universal so I'll see what happens.....<br />Maybe Hollywood executives should stop holding fundraisers and giving money to Bill Clinton and his pinko Democratic friends and instead, take some time and effort into actually checking to see if a DVD works before mass producing and selling it.
B00005NGSE|5.0|This is one of the best live concerts on CD,... #2 in my mind, behind UFO's &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;.<br />Listening to this for the first time in years brought back some wonderful memories.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Hey everyone, when I saw the Andrew WK video and heard the song on MTV, I was florred.  I thought, finally some fun music.  I  was so sick of hearing about boyband and everything else that this rocks.  With song lyrics like &quot;party till you puke,&quot; &quot;we wanna have fun and we wanna get wasted, and &quot;Party hard,&quot; how can you not like this.  If you like rock and like to drink beer with friends, this is the album for you!!<BR>Angel
B00005U11Z|3.0|If you're a diehard Journey fan, you will certainly enjoy this effort. The quality of the live production far outshines Journey's previous efforts. Sure, Steve Augeri sounds impressively adequate and probably better than Steve Perry would at this point. However, these songs are performed at least a full key lower than the originals and I found myself appreciating Steve Perry's old performances more after hearing Augeri struggle with some parts. Also, Augeri has the stage presence and dance moves of a drunken truckstop stripper. Nobody works a stage like S.Perry did. <br />Deen Castronovo is a student of the master, Steve Smith. Deen is more than adequate......he kicks a** !! He brings some much needed personality to some of S.Smith's \\"safe\\" drum parts. Jonathan Caine's stage presence is as cheesy as ever, Ross is flawless, and, of course, Neal is breathtakingly perfect and raw. He does need to lower his carb and fat intake, though.
6301773551|5.0|This is a very great movie.  This is the movie that started the whole star wars generation.  Imagine if their wasn't any sequels.  This would be a great movie, but it also makes a great addiction to a 6 part series.<br />   The evil galactic empire is on a pursuit of rebel fighters who have obtained confidential information of their new Weapon fortress (the death star).  They defeat the rebels, and capture the prisoner Princess Lei, who hides the plans in R2 D2. a droid.  r2 , with C-3p0, travel to the planet Tattoine. there, they go on a mission to find ben kenobi.  they encounter Luke skywalker, obiwan kenobi, han solo, and chewbacca, and they all venture out to aldreann to bring the plans to the princess.  Aldreann is blown up by the death star, and they are captured by the imperials.  they must escape the imperials, watch and find out how.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album really caught me off guard when I picked this cd up- I had heard a lot of the songs on the radio, but I wasn't really prepared for the cd. It starts off with the monumental Smells Like Teen Spirit, a great, if slightly overplayed track. From there on, the record continues without a bad track, and you can't help but listen to the entire album. In Bloom is a masterpiece, and Breed is even better, with fast punk rock riffs and Kurt Cobain's legendary, urgent voice. Polly is one of the best songs I've ever heard, about a 14 year old girl that was raped in Aberdeen, WA. Being from Seattle I knew about the thing Cobain was writing about, and the lyrics kind of shook me. Territoreal Pissings is a classic punk rock song, fast passionate riffs with Cobain screaming with all his heart. The last track, Something In the Way, is one of the simplest but the most mesmerizing. The verse is mysterious, obscure, but somehow makes perfect sense. The guitars are simple, but more powerful than any riffs I've ever heard. This album kind of caught me in a trance, with its intensity and passion. ANY fan of rock, metal, punk, hell ANYTHING needs to listen to this album. Its the definitive 90s album, and for a reason. Kurt Cobain Rest in Peace.
B00005RY7X|5.0|MAN! This is one of the best cd's I have EVER heard. It's the perfact soundtrack to th ideal night out. Loud, agressive, unusual, joyuos and all out fun. There's no [slow] ballads or anything like that just straight up dumb rock. I get wet is a mixture of death metal, punk, rock and its full of poppy melodies. It's just great. Truely music you can sing(shout) along with. I srongly recomend this album to anyone!
1577311523|1.0|I am a clinical psychologist and I would not recommend this to anyone. It is very reprimanding and illogical. Not only that but the author has a dangerous ego that can persuade undeveloped minds into his think and ONLY his thinking. This is very dangerous since the author himself seems to be of unstable mindset himself. Please for your mental health don't waste your money!
B00005JKJA|5.0|Regarding the comments by another reviewer, Roger Ebert says that David Lynch stated that there are no chapter stops on the DVD because the movie has to be seen from beginning to end. Since it is like a dream, you are supposed to see it unfold like a dream, from the start to the end.
B0000668IF|5.0|I bought this album this morning and, throughout the day, have been able to fit it into my schedule to listen to the whole CD twice.  I rarely like to write music reviews(I prefer movies), however, after listening to this, I wanted to make some comments.<br />There seems to be a growing backlash against Moby.  A lot of people have criticized the commercialism of \\"Play\\" and have railed against him,personally, for whatever reason(Eminem, on his new single, is the latest one to hop on the bandwagon). The fact of the matter is that Moby is one of the most exciting musical artist today, and his new album \\"18\\" proves that \\"Play\\" was no fluke.<br />\\"18\\" is similar to \\"Play\\" in many ways, however, at its core, the tone is different. A music critic for a well know entertainment magazine had it right when he said that Moby does not create songs from music samples so much as he creates modern symphonies.  Where \\"Play\\" was, for the most part, celebratory, \\"18\\", ultimately, is a somber, damp mood piece. <BR>Like his previous album, there are songs where he loops old gospel songs and molds it with infectious dance tracks.  The second track, \\"In This World\\" is an excellent example. Unlike \\"Play\\", however, he also uses samples from 70's R & B.  On the track, \\"Another Woman\\", a heartbroken lady wails, \\"You leave your home for days and days and I know you have another woman somewhere around.\\"  Listen to this song more than once and it really begins to grow on you.<br />The first side of this CD, as a whole, is more upbeat than the second side.  The first side contains two radio friendly songs(We Are All Made Of Stars and the thrilling Extreme Ways). When we get to the second side, the tone shifts darker and more barren(except for \\"Jam For the Ladies\\" which seems a litle out of place). The most unforgetable and most haunting song on the second side, and possibly the whole album, is \\"Sleep Alone\\".  With a dull piano playing in the background, Moby's thin voice whispers, \\"A city full ofpeople is desloate/we look back in the room where we live/at least we were together holding hands flying through the sky\\".  The theme of loss and anguish continue on \\"Harbour\\", a brilliantly sullen piece sung by Sinead O Connor.  When she sings, \\"Sadness flows like water and washes down the heartache\\" you can feel it.<BR>All is not gloomy on \\"18\\". Moby finishes the album with an uplifting spiritual, \\"I'm Not Worried At All\\" which ends the album on a perfect note.<br />It may take the casual listener two or three times to get the depth of this album.  As with all Moby projects, the order of the songs are just as important as the songs themselves. Listen to it with some focus and I guarantee you won't be able to get it out of your head. This album is a work of art and deserves the same recognition as \\"Play\\". A few years back, Moby had an album titled \\"Everything is Wrong\\".  Wether that's true or not, on \\"18\\", everything is right.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This cd is so good,John has such a talented voice, the words are so meaningful too! This is a really good date cd, definatly dont pass this one up its awesome! (especially #10)
B00005RY7X|5.0|i have no idea how this guy fits such a huge sound into his music. it's just so big, you can tell that so much was put into this album in terms of time, money, effort, and above all, positive energy.  listen to just a few tracks off this album and you'll wonder who the heck this guy is and how it is that someone can be so darn positive.  everyone is invited to his &quot;human party&quot;.  everyone.  in fact, 1/4 of the song titles have the word &quot;party&quot; in them.  his music and lifestyle send the message that it's okay, even great to be yourself, and he urges everyone take life by the horns and party as hard as you possibly can.  this is a great great album, and i'm not even into this type of music.
0553579908|5.0|Now THIS is a good series! I was getting so tired of, &quot;oh look, its ANOTHER dragon!&quot; fantasies. This book could ALMOST be real history. The characters (all 11,000 of them) are VERY well developed and I found myself laughing out loud or losing my breath in astonishment. This book hits you like a proverbial ton of bricks. Be warned though, this book is &quot;difficult&quot;. The plot twists are intense and the characters are plentiful. Sometimes its hard to keep up. I strongly suggest this whole series to anyone wanting to read a very believable, in-depth story. It might be boring to those fans of &quot;classic&quot; fantasy where a dragon, swordfight, goblin, troll etc pops up on every single page...<br />So mature readers only please.<br />Congratulations, Martin, on one hell of a series...you've become my favorite fantasy writer.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew WK's CD \\"I Get Wet\\" isn't one of those moaning & groaning, I'm sooo depressed, I hate myself CD's, this band is about having fun & partying, infact they party very hard!  Seriously though, I am not hyping this band, they are a genuinely good band with alot of positive energy & they are great at helping you to forget your own problems & helping you to have a good time!
6303419607|2.0|I ordered this item expecting it to be 3 Die Hard videos, but what it is is two of the movies and a third video about how the movies were made.  Very disapointing, especially as this was a gift for a Bruce Willis fan.  Item description should be more exact!
B00005JKQZ|3.0|Anyone who knows the real story of John Nash will be astonished at how different it is to this movie. I thought this movie was excellent as a movie, but as a story about someone's life, the creative license applied is unforgiveable...
B00005JKED|2.0|This movie was a great disappointment to me....I suppose I didn't expect it to be so full of violence and deceit.  My husband says I wear rose colored glasses, so it was much too realistic for my taste.  I guess it's one thing to know something like that might actually happen, but to see it is another story.  Denzel did a good job, however....can't knock his acting in this, but the movie on a whole left me feeling sad.
0385505833|5.0|I'm not a John Grisham reader, but was given this book as (you guessed it) a Christmas present. It was excellent, and while somewhat a little preposterous, very very funny and so true about our hectic lives we suddenly jump into around Christmas time. By the second third of the book, I wasn't sure what the end was going to bring, but it was very well done. I think everyone who is, oh, say, in their mid-thirties and older should read this book. You have to have gone through the hustle and bustle of Christmas and all its materialism and hype and excitement to thoroughly appreciate what he has to say. Read it and then pass it on!
B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew W.K. is the new savior of rock and roll. This album kicks you right in the face with its sound. Its like Judas Priest on steroids. The opening track \\"Its time to Party\\" is a great opener for the album, \\"Party Hard\\" is by far the best radio song since \\"Enter Sandman\\". You can listen to this whole album and not skip one tune...its that good. Other great tracks are \\"I Love N.Y.\\" and \\"She Is Beautiful.\\" Trust Me it kicks...
B00000K19E|5.0|What other reason do you need to buy this movie?<br />It looks great.  Has great sound.<br />BUT the features fall short.  <BR>Where are deleted scenes? What about a decent commentary track?<br />Do yourself the favor and purchase &quot;Maxtrix Revisited&quot; in addition to the movie.  That disc kicks @ss.  Look it.  You will want it.
B00005B36H|5.0|Well, I've read several of the Lateralus reviews here, and what the heck, I'm going to add another one.  <br />Tool music is dark, brooding, but most of all, it's HEAVY.  If forced to single out one aspect of Tool's music that makes it most unique, it's got to be the drumming of Danny Carey.  Unbelievably fast and accurate, it somehow seems that he hits the skins HARDER than any other drummer I've ever heard.  It's a gift, pure and simple; the guy is a mutant.  The most amazing thing that jumps out at you from a live Tool recording is Carey's drums.  His speed and accuracy are not products of the studio; his live drumming is just as flawless, powerful and mind-boggling.  The Lateralus disc may be the best showcase yet of Carey's talent.  Which track, you ask?  Hell, every track!  All of them!  Listen and be amazed.<br />Tool music is so complicated and intelligent, it's almost humbling to the listener.  There is power aplenty; yet, there is also beauty in abundance.  There's rage and raw emotion; but the lyrics are deep, meaningful and insightful.  Tool pulls off that most difficult of accomplishments: they make serious music, but they don't make the mistake of taking themselves too seriously.  With \\"Lateralus\\", Tool has hit a peak of creativity and execution that is so good, it's hard to believe.  Those who find Lateralus long and boring: I pity you.  <br />Highlights on this disc?  In truth, you get more quality tracks on this single CD than I can ever remember hearing on any two CD's combined.  Thanks to a couple of minutes of silence between the disc's last real track \\"Triad\\" and the finale, an interesting spoken-word take on alien conspiracy theory called \\"Faaip de Oiad\\", you get as much music as can possibly fit on a single CD (over 79 minutes).  \\"The Grudge\\" is a great track, with a catchy chorus; it was the opening song for Tool's North America tour concerts last fall.  <br />The middle part of the disc, with the grammy-winning cut \\"Schism\\", followed by \\"Parabol/Parabola\\", is the part I listen to over and over in my car.  I love the way \\"Parabol\\", with its soft, almost-whispered lead vocal, forces you to turn up your stereo, only so you can be SLEDGEHAMMERED by the first notes of \\"Parabola\\", the much-harder anthem that follows and uses many of the same lyrics.<br />\\"Ticks and Leeches\\", a song filled with anger and hostility, assaults the senses, then backs off into a soft, almost relaxing effect for a couple of minutes, only to pause, then assault the listener again.  \\"Disposition/Reflection/Triad\\" then closes out the disc; a 20-minute-plus series of three tracks that are meant to go together, and are performed one after the other in Tool concerts.  <br />I know it's cool to say that \\"Lateralus\\" isn't all that; and of course, to some people it may not be.  For those who don't or can't appreciate \\"Lateralus\\" and don't recognize its ground-breaking impact, I feel sorry for you.
B00005TT77|2.0|I like the Beatles.  I like the idea of people covering the Beatles.  I just don't agree with the selection of people they chose.<br />The best track on the disc is Eddie Vedder's.  The rest are just...there to sell a disc.<br />Borrow it and then burn it.

B000063S6Z|4.0|This is not a repeat of the \\"Play\\".  Yet it is not an advancement of musical skills.<BR>It's more like a best of...with new music.<BR>Moby revisits himself.  An interesting idea.<BR>From \\"Go\\" to \\"Everything is wrong\\" to \\"I like to score\\" to \\"Play.\\"  All bases are covered.<BR>The only thing really missing is some rock and roll ala \\"Animal Rights\\".<br />Buy the album.  It is good.
B00005RY7X|5.0|There comes a point in every young boy's life when he must become a man.  For ancient Indians the rituals wre painful and slow, for the American of the 50's demeaning and debasing but for our generation Andrew WK is that ritual.<br />From dale to mountain top, I Get Wet is a rollercoaster ride of energy and excitement.  Every time you think you've found the high point to the album, along comes the next song and WHAM you're up higher than you've been before.<br />And epic recording with surefire tunes like 'She is Beautiful', 'I Get Wet', and 'Lets Get Ready to Die', I Get Wet is sure to become a staple on all time best critic's lists.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby is extraordinary and in his full glory on an album like this - one that showcases the best that disparate forms of music can offer transmuted through the hyperkinetic, masterful, playful channel that is Moby.<br />Moby proves that there is hope for electronic music and it comes from the mind of a real musician. With Moby, the medium is the message and he gets really out there to give you what you want as a listener. His performances are flawless and recently he's been paying respects to those who influence him, namely Bowie.<br />You gotta love this guy.
B00005YW4H|3.0|As a singer, Norah Jones has something... and maybe that's a promise of truly memorable music down the road. (Hey, I hope so -- for her sake and mine.)  But she hasn't created that memorable music yet. Right now, I get the sense she's not sure what she wants to do with her voice, with these songs.  She seems to be trying out different things...well, just because she can, not because they fit her.  I hear lots of different singers in her approach...a whole lot of Ray Charles for one....but don't get a real sense of who Norah Jones is as a singer. Also, unfortunately, the piano playing could have been better. I'm actually surprised that Blue Note has put all its muscle here...behind what is a reasonable but nevertheless rookie effort when there's legit polished talent out there just waiting...but hey, don't mind me, listen for yourself...
0060090367|2.0|Starting the book was mainly fun but 2/3rds through it began to drag. At the end I just felt sorry for the main character and wondered why I am reading it. I am missing the last 15 pages and only am going to finish reading it because I hate to leave a book after 90% ... But never the less, if you like reading books and dont mind leaving it go after 60% it is fun to read ...

B00005RY7X|5.0|Let's just say I haven't taken the CD out of my CD player since I bought the CD over a month ago. Every single song is hard, fast, fist pumping rock. If you like fast mash rock then I reccommend this album to you.<BR>AWK rules
038533558X|4.0|Gone for Good will not soon leave your memory files.  This book will not be Gone for Good it will say with you. His previous book Tell No One was the best mystery book i read in years so I was somewhat worried to read his newest book.  Somehow this author has created 2 excellent who done it page turners.  I started reading this book Saturday morning and did not put it down until I finished it.  To me, that is the best adventure in reading I could ever wish for.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Very few albums have I been excited about in the last year or so, but this was one of them. From the first time I saw the video I was like, this guy has come to save rock and roll.  Fast songs, clever lyrics and a driving beat make this a perfect addition to any drunken bash or weekend get together.  If you like rock and roll, hair metal, punk rock, whatever, pick it up today.
B00005Y7OJ|5.0|One of my favorite Pet Shop Boys albums of all time!!  Not only is it very danceable but it also sends very powerful messages of hope!!  You can pop in this album and get the party going with upbeat songs like &quot;Discoteca&quot; or &quot;Single.&quot;  Yet you can also depend on the lyrics of &quot;Se A Vida E&quot; or &quot;The Survivors&quot; to lighten dampened spirits.  Other outstanding tracks include &quot;A Red Letter Day,&quot; &quot;Electricity,&quot; and the ballad &quot;It Always Comes as a Surprise.&quot;  If you are a true PSB fan, this is a MUST!
B00005RY7X|5.0|This album is exceptionally entertaining, brings to mind bands like KISS, truly a work of art!  Very High Energy!  Party Hard is one track you can listen to over and over again.  This guy is just what I have been listening for! I love it!
0140177396|5.0|The themes of man's inhumanity to man, the nature of friendship, and labor vs management all come shining through in this touching classic.  A few reviewers worried that the book may be a little tough for children under fourteen to handle; ironically, this is a true testament to this book's enduring impact on American culture.  It is too late to worry about really young children \\"reading\\" this story, because if they grew up in America watching the Saturday morning cartoons, they have already watched the movie version of OF MICE AND MEN several hundred times.  That's right.  Warner Brothers cartoons frequently paired a big, strong, dumb character with a little pipsqueek who comically controls him, slaps him around, or takes care of him.  The little guy is \\"the Boss.\\"  They got that routine straight from Steinbeck's novel.  If you want examples, the most recent one is probably Pinkie and the Brain, but they have done it for years with cats, dogs, wolves, and zoot-suited gangsters.  The big ox-like one is almost always stumbling into and accidentally smacking the [heck] out of the little boss in his eagerness to pursue the prey, often Bugs Bunny.  \\"Which way did he go? Which way did he go?  The wittle wabbit, I want to hug him and squeeze him, and hug him.\\"  \\"Shaddup!\\"  Slap!
B00005RY7X|5.0|This cd kicks some major A** its just some headbanging good time. its a wall of sound that you break through and its such a rush the first time you hear it you feel like partying.
B00003CXSP|5.0|I have seen a lot of horror film in my time, but I have never been repulsed the way I was during the final, infamous scene with Ray Liotta. Not for the faint of heart or those with weak stomachs. Incredible screenplay, though. Clarice is back, on the hunt for Hannibal Lecter, and he is on the loose in Florence, Italy. The interesting side-story involves a survivor of a Lecter attack, Gary Oldman in very disturbing make-up, that will make you want to turn away from the screen. But you cant. The way the plot twists and turns will drive you mad. Lecter is so over the top as a villain, it borders on self parody, but I'll say one thing. You want to be on the Doctor's good side. You never want to join him for dinner.
B00005YU1O|4.0|If you are the philosophical type, you will probably love this film. The loose story is brought together nicely by numerous vinettes of quircky actors, most of whom are simply playing themselves. I loved the film, but I could see that if you are the kind of person who wants action, characterization, or even a comprehensive story, you probably will not like it. The movie-making style and soundtrack are incredible, however. On the DVD, the live-action clips that they used to make the animation are really fun to watch as well.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Episode 1 has a good plot, superb special effects, and a few good actors. This movie also has many terrible actors, unneccisary characters, and a lot of stupidity. Sometimes I feel like I'm watching a sci-fi kids show. I will now list pros and cons about this movie.<br />Pros:<BR>-Good plot<BR>-plenty of battles throughout<BR>-podracers were fun except they focused on Anikan too much<BR>-Many new species, Some more annoying than others<BR>-Superb special effects<BR>-Cool destroy droids (at least something can worry a jedi)<BR>-many more<br />Cons<BR>-End battle dissapointing (Focuses on Anikan way to much!!!)<BR>-Anikan!!! The great 9- year old podracer, builder,             mechanic, slave, whatever!!<BR>-The gayest battle droids ever<BR>-Anikan was a terrible actor<BR>-Qui-Gon-Jin was a terrible actor<BR>-Jar Jar Binks the annyoing thing no on likes<BR>-many more<br />Well now that George Lucas has hopefully learned his lesson, Qui-Gon-Jin is dead, and there is a new actor for Anikan, Episode 2 should be awesome. Hopefully there is no more Jar Jar Binks too.<BR>I can't wait to see episode 2!!!
B00004SCX6|1.0|My 5 year old daughter asked me for this so I bought it used.  You would think there would be a couple of good tracks besides the title track.  Nope - I should have bought the single.
B000007NYS|5.0|&quot;They&quot; dont make music like this anymore.  They probably never did.  This is apparently Lucinda's breakout album, but I came across it only recently (after several months of regular listening to &quot;Car Wheels...&quot; -- great in its own right).  This is the best of the two, but only by the width of a guitar string. Ms. Williams'lyrics are long on insight and short on pretense. Her music can be as plain and pretty as a bouquet of wild flowers, or as hard and smoky as a honky tonk.  If 21st Century life -- and its music -- sometimes wear you down, kick back for about 50 minutes with this CD and let Lucinda soothe your weary soul.
B00005QK39|5.0|While Marillion were always dogged by the Genesis Clone label, they really were an excellent band in their own right. The quality of the songwriting and musicianship is particularly strong on this, their magical debut.<br />The first thing to grab you about Marillion is the haunting cover art of the superb Mark Wilkinson, who continued to work with fellow genius, Fish, after the big fella left Marillion. (Their lavishly illustrated book Masque is an absolutely essential purchase.)<br />Script is one of those rare albums where every single track is a classic. Yet this double CD version is most definitely the one to go for, as Disc 2 contains further indispensible classics, such as Market Square Heroes (2 versions), the breathtaking Three Boats Down From The Candy (which perhaps more than any other track truly encapsulates the very core of Fish-Marillion's magic) and the epic Grendel, which has been described as their Supper's Ready.<br />Just as Genesis carried on in name only when Peter Gabriel left, so too Marillion continued to (legitimately) use the name after Fish moved on. However, in each case, however well the remaining band members rallied and put out solid albums, a large part of the original magic left with the lead singers.<br />If you only ever buy one Marillion album, let this be it... but... why stop at only one?<br />I agree with reviewer Jorge that it is sad there had been no previous reviews of such a fine and defining album. It would be a tragedy if the original band and this magical album should be forgotten.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This is one of those CDs where you leg it home from the shop as soon as you've bought it and you bang it straight in the CD player. AND, after all the hype, you're not disappointed.<BR>Every single track on this CD is a winner - its real feel-good heavy rock music that makes you want to jump around and shout loudly.<BR>Particular favourite tracks (although they're all great) are Girls Own Love, Got To Do It and She is Beautiful. <BR>I reckon that even if you dont want to like this CD, you will anyway. There is nothing to not like - it is melodic, anthemic, punk-pop set against heavy metal riffs - AMAZING!<BR>Buy this CD and give Andrew WK the recognition he deserves - he is a god!
B00005R2M3|5.0|I bought Shakira's album a few weeks ago, and it still manages to spellbind me. Her voice, her foot-thumping, dance-inducing beats, and the messages in the lyrics are so amazing that I can't stop listening to it! I don't speak that much Spanish (I'm taking it in school) but it is still so much fun to listen to and memorize the lyrics to them. My favorite songs are as follows:<br />1: Underneath Your Clothes. This song has a melodic pop-rock-then back to pop beat that keeps me humming and singing all day. The lyrics are strong and the vocals are great.<br />2: Te Dejo Madrid. No, I don't really know what she's saying, but the music and the fast beat combined with the quick and unforgettable vocals make this song one to remember.<br />3: Whenever, Wherever. I LOVE this song. It moves fast and never lets go, it's lyrics are constantly playing themselves in my head. I could never play this song out.<br />4: The One. A slower, yet very emotional song. It displays Shakira's true vocal talent when she spikes at those high, long notes. <br />5: Eyes Like Yours. This song has a catchy Arabic beat that makes you want to dance (and I do dance!). The lyrics are a little hard to remember, but definitely put this song up there.<br />Thsi CD is definitely a MUST-BUY for anyone that is interested in having a good time while listening to music.
B0000668IF|4.0|No, this is not Play part 2. Let that be known from the start. So if you're looking for that then don't even listen to this CD. 18 however, IS, a sweet pleasure and does seem to smooth you out whenever you listen to it. Let's take a deep look into this:<br />1.) We Are All Made of Stars - Yes, this is the song you have been hearing EVERYWHERE. Good song, very metaphorical. Not quite sure if it is first single material though.<BR>2.) In This World - Vintage Moby. Great song with a sample of an old gospel song. Jennifer Price's vocals are amazing. Some say the best love songs are those sung to God. Can't argue with that!<BR>3.) In My Heart - Lot's of keyboard sounds on here. Very soothing with awesome vocals by The Shining Light Gospel Choir.<BR>4.) Great Escape - Azure Ray's vocals are illustrious. Very light listening song.<BR>5.) Signs of Love - A Moby love song....picture that. And guess what? Moby is on vocals! Good song.<BR>6.) One of These Mornings - Dianne McCaulley's singing can be felt from the bottom of her heart. It's almost as if she's singing directly at you. Makes you think a lot. Slow, catchy beat on this one.<BR>7.) Another Woman - Weird sample on this one, but hey, Moby is the epitome of weirdness.<BR>8.) Fireworks - Slow, melodic instrumental. Pure keyboard.<BR>9.) Extreme Ways - Moby on vocals again. Weird song.<BR>10.) Jam for the Ladies - Moby goes Hip-Hop. Angie Stone and the comeback of MC Lyte on this one. Groovy sound.<BR>11.) Sunday (The Day Before My Birthday) - Depressing song but good. Is that Moby on vocals again? Just Kidding.<BR>12.) 18 - Another slow instrumental. Makes you think of standing on top of a mountain. Cool flow to this one.<BR>13.) Sleep Alone - As close as a Post 9-11 song from Moby as you're going to get. Slow, freaky song. Very weird sample on this one. Wait a minute....that's Moby!<BR>14.) At Least We Tried - Classic, vintage, Freedom Bremner vocals on this one. Very Good! Great break up song.<BR>15.) Harbour - Wonderful song. Sinéad O'Connor on vocals \\"Washing down the heart-ache\\".<BR>16.) Look Back In - Yet, another, keyboard-laced instrumental. Any elevator music fans out there?<BR>17.) Rafters - Shauna and Lorraine Phillips on this one. Lot's of humming on this one. Good song.<BR>18.) I'm Not Worried At All - Hey! It's The Shining Light Gospel Choir again! Relaxing tune.<br />Post 9/11, it only makes me think why didn't this album come out a few months earlier. Some moments are a bit too depressing though. Like on \\"Sleep Alone\\" where Moby sings, \\"At least we were together, holding hands, flying through the sky.\\" But then again, Moby does seem like he came straight out of the depression period. With Moby, everything is enjoyably predictable.
B00005V9HA|4.0|I've waited literally years for this one. By the time I bought a DVD player the original edition was out-of-print. So, finally, the moment we've all waited for...well, it's alright. First of all I WILL say that the new transfer is first rate, although I was a little disapointed that the picture isn't clearer; I guess I just didn't realize the limitations of the original negative. Sela vis. And the new 5.1 sound mix? Fantastic! I love the inclusion of the THX Optimizer for those of us who can really use one to calibrate our televisions to the proper settings. Now for the unpleasant part. The new interviews with Stuart Gordon and Brian Uzna are good but really don't offer much insight and get a little monotonous. And all the &quot;extended scenes?&quot; I'd hate to ruin it for you all but they were ALL included on the original, R-rated VHS release (though not on the unrated one). I still consider this a must-have but as for hardcore fans looking for the Holy Grail, this one just missed it by an inch or so.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew W.K. has what you need to get a party going and keep it going till the break of dawn. He is the best rocker born and you won't be able to get enough of his lyrics, and sexy looks! Buy it and you'll get wet.

I tried his two fairy tales and these were the ones that felt not as imaginative as one could have hoped for.<br />American Gods, on the other hand, is an epic novel of wonderful proportions. Anyone with an interest in fantastic, mystic stories and all fans of classic Americana should love it.

Read it.
B00000IQC8|4.0|I loved this movie and I laughed heartily throughout. The characters, although all a bit goofy, seem like people I have met and that gave it a true to life feel that made it very easy to watch. I also loved the fact that this was shot on a tiny budget proving ,once again, that you don't need millions of dollars, Julia Roberts and exploding battleships to make a movie that audiences will love. You need what you get in \\"Clerks\\": good actors, a good script and a good director.<BR>Recommended

B00003CX9E|5.0|This groundbreaking film is testimony to the genius of Orson Welles. Virtually every aspect of this film pushed the envelope of the art of filmmaking and movies were forever changed after CK. Aside from the innovations, the script, performances and direction are all absolutely first rate. It's hard to see how anyone can fail to give this anything less than five stars. <BR>Highest recommendation!
0446608955|3.0|&quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; was a tear jerking love story. But the twist of the whole story was that the two in love, Landon and Jamie, were two totally different people. Sure, it makes for a great love story, but I don't believe the \\"popular jock\\" and the \\"nerdy angel\\" would ever get together. Their relationship was just too good to be true. I saw the movie before I read the book, and for once, the movie version was better. It was interesting to see how the authors were portrayed in a movie. &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; was unrealistic, somewhat predictable, yet beautifully written with true feelings of love. It was a touching, beautiful love story that any sensitive love story addict would love.  It might make you laugh and smile a few times, but mostly it will touch your heart and bring tears to your eyes.
B00003CXRM|5.0|The Coen brothers have done it again. This bizarre mix of ingredients works well as a comedy, an mythical allegory and a drama. Very funny throughout, this film also holds attention with the witty script, compelling storyline (it's hard to top Homer for a co-writer!) and great performances by all the principals. Nice to know that Hollywood gets it right once in a while. <BR>Recommended
B000002BUY|5.0|this CD is the only incubus CD that i could play often. the songs on here are all really good and diverse. especially \\"redefine\\", \\"new skin\\", \\"idiot box\\", \\"glass\\", \\"favorite things\\", \\"anti gravity love song\\" (really different), \\"nebula\\", \\"deep inside\\", and \\"calgone\\". it is really unfourtunate that they have taken the downfall that they have. make yourself was good but you could tell what direction they were going. morning view is really quite bland, particularly the radio hits. if you want great incubus, S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is the only incubus CD that has all of their talent shown on it without becoming bland or repetetive EVER.
B000009RC2|5.0|Whew, this album still kicks a** 30 years later! Raw, intense and gritty, its power lies in the boldness and imagination of these amazing players and the innovative and challenging compositions. McLaughlin &amp; company  carved out a permanent place in music history with this album. Although MO went on to great things, (&quot;Birds of Fire&quot; and &quot;Between Nothingness and Eternity&quot;) this album is suffused with the  the white hot forge of creativity. There is a crackle and spark that leaps out from the speakers. The uncanny rapport between McLaughlin and Cobham, the fiery solos from Goodman and Hammer's fresh East European tinged improvisations combine in a kind of alchemy that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up. Not be missed by any serious music lover.<br />Highest recommendation!
B00004Z459|1.0|How I could have ever thought this was as good as I did is beyond me. No one in this band is talented at all. I guess the turntable guy might be good at what he does but turntables are horrible so it doesn't matter. The music, which they claim to be metal HA!, is watered-down, easy, repetitive garbage. Especially in the guitars. The vocals are horrible. Chester can't sing. Every live show they have show his true horrible voice. It probably took every voice distorter in the studio to make it sound tolerable as it does on here. The other guy is a rapper and that just pretty much speaks for itself. The only reason they have even one star is because you can't give them any less. The whole generation of nu-metal and rap/metal makes me sick. Record companies will sign ANYONE and here is the proof.
B000005QH3|5.0|As several reviewers have pointed out, they just don't make films like this one any more; the existential B movie is a thing of the past, alas! Thankfully &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; is still available, and still as compelling &amp; thought-provoking as ever. While some may find the countercultural elements dated, I disagree: the outward trappings may have changed over the decades, but the spirit is ever-present; if anything, the need &amp; longing for a different life, a world outside the encroaching Everyday, is even stronger today, in a world saturated with consumerism, conformity &amp; compliance. Again, while Kowalski's odyssey may specifically reference the post-Woodstock era of diminished meaning &amp; dwindling spiritual freedom, the all-encompassing need to KNOW &amp; embracepersonal meaning is still very much alive. As Kowalski races faster &amp; faster across the remnants of an America that's as much myth as substance, we can still be carried along with him, not quite sure of what we're seeking, but indeed &quot;driven &quot; to find it ...
B00000JCOV|4.0|the only 2 reasons that this CD got 4 stars instead of 5 is beacuse the best song (purity) was cut off of this and &quot;tattered and torn&quot; is a bad song. outside of that, this is a great Cd that is incredibly brutal and heavy. they do modern-day metal the right way. they don't lose this great sound in IOWA either even though it isn't really as good as this one. &quot;eyeless&quot;, &quot;surfacing&quot;, &quot;me inside&quot;, &quot;liberate&quot; and my all-time favorite on this album outside of purity, &quot;no life&quot; are the stand-out tracks on this album. if you like bands like sepultura, mudvayne, mushroomhead, or drowning pool, this is another band you will grow to love.
B0000668IF|2.0|I am sure Moby was under incredible pressure to match the success of his hugely popular Play.  The pressure must have got to him because this effort falls short.  I admire him for not trying to duplicate his sound on Play, but the fact is that most of this album sounds uninspired.  I enjoyed listening to a couple of the tracks, but the other 16 wee little more than white noise.  Hopefully Moby will be back with his next effort and offer something with a little more meat to it.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Visually delicious and innovative, yes, but never mind: this is  a masterpiece of truth-telling artistry. <br />Puts the first glimpses of the young sage under a well-focused pop culture macroscope, and every seeker i know who saw it wanted to watch it on infinite loop.<br />Gentle warning:  this film requires extra humility from people who think they don't have any big lessons left to learn, extra patience from those who get restless sitting still and listening, and extra courage from those who are so jaded that they resist being stirred to dream of awakening.
B000062TU1|4.0|Don't get me wrong,  I'm a big fan of the book as well as the movie but the DVD really disappointed me.     I'd been expecting to see something special on DVD.    But I cannot find any promised unseen scenes.     All they can give are some silly stuffs on DVD 2.<br />If you're a fan, buy the movie anyway.      But I don't recommend the DVD.    If you want to save some money,  just get either VHS or VCD (asia).

B000063DS1|5.0|The dream of millions of The Band fans has at last come true. The Last Waltz box set gives the deserved honour to Rick Danko, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel and Robbie Robertson. Honour for the best rock and roll concert of all time.<br />The addition of the missing songs, new mixing of the music and the improved layout are things that make this package something very special. <br />The box set includes no less than 15 songs, which were dropped out from the original publications. Plus, there are a few concert rehearsal versions. It was high time to hear the performances of such songs as `WS Walcott Medicine Show' and `Don't Do It' - the very last song The Band ever played together on stage. As far as guest performances are concerned, `Caldonia' (with Muddy Waters) and `Hazel' (with Bob Dylan) are nothing to be left as takeouts. For the sake of curiosity it's worth mentioning that Robbie's 12-bar Clapton-imitation guitar solo (which is there in The Last Waltz film as Eric fiddles with his guitar strap) on `Further on Up the Road' can be enjoyed now on CD as well.<br />Thanks to the new mixing, the overall sound of The Last Waltz is different. For example, `The Shape I'm In' is stronger than ever as a perfect The Band song: Richard growling the lyrics, Robbie filling in with delicate guitar licks, Rick bouncing about irresistibly with the bass and Levon hitting the drums like throwing big rocks on a tin roof.  All this sweetened by Garth's capturing organ. The Last Waltz sounds brighter and fresher - basically it sounds much more authentic. Close your eyes and you are at Winterland...<br />The layout is improved by a thick booklet. It includes a lot of behind-the-scenes stories about The Band and The Last Waltz as well as a tidy collection of photos. Fine supporting material.<br />The Last Waltz box set is pleasingly short of letdowns. Joni Mitchell's `Coyote' is great, but her two previously unreleased songs, especially `Furry Sings the Blues', bring an unwanted plunge of quality to the set. Neil Diamond's less-than-magical `Dry Your Eyes' was familiar already from The Last Waltz LP.<br />Although The Last Waltz box set is a little pricy, it's worth every penny. Money becomes a secondary issue as one listens to Rick, Levon, Richard, Robbie and Garth play gloriously with and without the friends. The Last Waltz really happens. To quote Dr John a little: `Thanks to The Band and all the fellas.'
B000031WYP|5.0|This recording is absolutely superb! The digital remastering is excellent and there is no static or overbalance in any portion of the entire opera. The recording also sounds distincly \\"live\\" as though one were sitting near the orchestra pit at an actual performance.<br />Although many people don't like Von Karajan, I think he did an exceptional job bringing to life music which we have all heard (the intermezzo).<br />Bergonzi, as usual, is perfect, his voice in top form and even from low to high. He brings a sense of angry passion to the stage and one cannot help but feel sorry for scorned Turridu. The same goes for Fiorenza Cossotto's Santuzza. She sings the role beautifully, never yelling or oversinging.<br />The rest of the cast compliments the story nicely, Martino's Lola sounding appropriately happy and cheery. Guelfi as Alfio is great and his voice eminates his jealousy very well. Mariagrazia Allegri's Mamma Lucia is very supportive and she sounds like an older, wiser woman throughout the entire opera.<br />This recording is great in every aspect including price.  Some of the most beautiful music ever composed and the best spinto singing ever done.
B000059TPN|5.0|this movie &quot;rocks&quot;! It is really cool and has good acting and a great storyline. The special effects were great and the chase scene was awesome. Definetely deserves five stars.
B00005RY7X|5.0|i heard about andrew wk from some friends who were visiting from england.  he was already fairly big there evidently before &quot;i get wet&quot; started making a commotion here in the states.<br />and i truly have to thank them.  right as i was getting bored with everything that was being put out lately in the music world, i heard &quot;i get wet&quot; and was amazed.  the album is fun, energetic and lets you know that you should really be having a good time no matter what.  <br />metal influence but poppy in the best kind of way, you can't help but sing, pump your fists in the air and dance around like there is no tomorrow.  if you haven't yet heard any of his music you must check andrew wk out.  as terrible rock rules the airwaves he is a breath of fresh, fun, air.
B00003CX5P|1.0|When I first saw Episode 1 in the theaters back in '99 I was dissapointed. When I first saw the Star Wars Trilogy in the special edition, it was my favorite set of sci-fi movies (with the exception of episode VI). Every character in Episode 1 cannot act. Ewan Mcgregor and Liam Neeson seem like they're bored. Shouldn't they be excited that they're starring in STAR WARS???? The worst performances in the film would have to go to that little boy playing Anakin. By far the worst performance EVER in a star wars film. Hell, I CAN even act better. Episode 1 has lots of special effects and CGI, WAY TOO MUCH OF THEM. It's like watching a very beautiful playstation game. The script was also poorly written. It's like Lucas wrote it in his spare time. The only decent performance probably goes to Darth Maul, who doesn't even have any lines.
0920668364|5.0|I first heard this story at a convention I attended as a Kindergarten teacher.  Many people were teary eyed. I didn't purchase the book at the conference, however, someone gave it to me as a gift after I gave birth to my son.  It is read quite often in my home, 11 years and 3 children later!  After reading the story to my children or even hearing someone else read it, I still need a tissue! I would recommend this book to anyone, especially mothers-to-be. This book affects me in much the same way as the book Guess How Much I Love You.

X 6/10 another fast one with no real tune<BR>6. Chopsuey! 9/10 (at least) This is a cracking song with a great ending!<BR>7. Bounce 6.5/10 woh this is weird<BR>8. Forest 9/10 This is another great song which is weird yet brilliant<BR>9. ATWA 9/10 perhaps the slowest song on the album. Yet moving and brilliant<BR>10. Science 7.5/10 This is a good quick song<BR>11. Shimmy 7.5/10 This is short but I like the tune<BR>12. Toxicity 9/10 the big hit! This is an awesome song!<BR>13. Psycho 7/10 not bad, fast and difficult to sing along to.<BR>14. Aerials 8/10 I probably should have given this more but the tune annoys me. This is a slow one and it's good but it still annoys me<br />So there you go! BUY THE ALBUM! IT'S AWESOME!!!!! (The Offspring rule don't forget)
0380973650|5.0|Okay, I have to say that I have indeed read this book, am a dedicated Gaiman fan, and thought it was excellent.  Now on to what I really want to talk about.  I don't understand how anyone can rate any book as 1 star.  Maybe they put so much into their reading that they expect a ton out of it, but I find that I learn something from everything I read (even if it's what not to do in a book).  Maybe it's because I can read over 1000 pages in a day (I have read all of the Wheel Of Time books in a day each), but I don't understand how &quot;fluff&quot; is a bad thing.  I've read a great number of the &quot;classics&quot; and liked a few of them (Crime and Punishment is still one of my favorite books) but I think that people who only read classics are missing out on a lot of things.  The only books I can say I truly disliked were the Sword of Truth series after Wizard's First Rule (which is one of my favorite books - go figure).  While I may may gotten tired of some books (and who isn't tired of Drizzt books or The Wheel Of Time?) that doesn't make them bad.  You wouldn't think being an English major I would think this way, since they teach you to hate everything but the classics and &quot;serious&quot; fiction, still, I can't give up on my love of reading.  While I admit some books may be more age appropriate that others (Xanth good at 10, poor at 20) I think most good books can be appreciated at most any age, differently each time.  Forgive me my rambling, it's 4:30 AM and I'm just frustrated at reading 1 star reviews of good books.  I realize this is terribly written, but I can't really edit to well in this little window, and these thoughts were only half-formed when I sat down to write.  I apologize.
078322737X|5.0|I just watched the DVD the other night and I thought that they did a great job of preserving this American classic on the DVD format.  It is a must own and I hope to be purchasing it soon.  The best thing about the film is that it is so human and even the filmmaking depicts a certain roughness, as explained in the &quot;Making of the movie&quot; section included on the DVD.  The film is brilliantly cast and offers a poignant look at the era that was the early 1960s, the end of innocence.  I love this film and if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it!
0920668364|5.0|Love You Forever is the story of a mother's unconditional love.  This book is a wonderful story of the love between a mother and son.

Children of all ages are reminded of their parent's love.  It illustrates that love endures and goes on forever.  <BR>     This book would be a great gift for any new parent.

B000000WJZ|5.0|I believe I could write a full length review on each song on this album. It's that good. Every single track is breath-taking in its own unique way. The first track, Cherub Rock, opens with a simple drum beat, then slowly builds as new instruments are added one by one until it explodes into an orgasmic blend of guitars, drums, and pure listening pleasure. It has been my favorite song for the last 5 years, as have the Pumpkins been my favorite band. Combine deep, meaningfull lyrics with relentless drumming and unforgettable guitar riffs and solos and you have quite possibly the best album in recent history. I don't feel I can give it the praise and credit it deserves with words. Besides the timeless hits Cherub Rock, Today, and Disarm, every song is pure musical bliss, especially the somewhat mellow ballads Mayonaise and Soma and the heavy, guitar-filled rockers Geek USA and Quiet. The only other CD in the 90's that comes close is Mellon Collie. Buy this album now if, heaven forbid, you haven't already.
B0000667RO|5.0|I'm so glad I got this cd. I bought it thinking I knew a few of his songs, but it turns out that I know almost all of them. Each song takes me back to a time and a place that touches my heart and reminds me of how my life was when I heard it the first time. Few songs have ever moved me as much as his song Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman does again and again everytime I hear it. In it's sweet and emotional simplicity, the song really represents the entire cd. Each of his words are sung with deep feeling and each note he plays with heart. Fot anyone who's the slightest fan I recommend this cd. There are some really, really great classics on it and if anything else it reminds us that Bryan Adams is one of the most underrated legends in pop music.
B000000W6F|5.0|I had been a Pumpkins fan for several years before I even heard Gish. I fell in love with the driving guitars and melodies of Siamese Dream (which i consider the best album of the 90's -by anyone) and the pure magic of Mellon Collie. When I finally heard this album I was amazed, not only at the quality of the music, but also by the fact that it is practically unknown to anyone besides hardcore SP fans. While the entire CD is solid, the first four songs are among the best Corgan has ever written. Siva and Bury Me contain some of the best guitar playing and drum beats I've ever heard and the multi-textured Rhinoceros is a reflection of the great range heard on their future albums. Even if you're not a big fan of the band, this album is a must have. It is a great work by the best rock band in recent history.
B00005JKMQ|4.0|Ali was a great movie to see! I would have rated it a 5 star film but the all music no diolauge scenes were too long and too frequent. Will Smith did a fantastic job as Ali and deserved the nomination for best actor that he recieved. Though I will speak highly of it I would not suggest buying this movie without renting it first... the dramatic musical scenes ruined the movie for many people that I've talked to. I bought my used for $6 so... for $6 it's a great movie! I would NOT pay $20 for this movie, but I would recommend it as a good 4 star film!
0140185232|5.0|This is one of my favorite books.  I love the way Maugham places himself into the story as observer, and his incredible insight of the wonderful characters.  Larry's pursuit of spiritual fulfillment, and his resulting conclusions are told in a way as to illuminate the  conundrums we all have regarding religion and higher powers. Isabelle is the original material girl, but a feast to Maughams eyes.  Elliott has to be the biggest snob on the face of the earth, yet Maugham delights the reader with his snobbery and foibles.  The sub-story of the tragic Sophie, reveals to us that human nature never changes.  The book is set in the late 20's and 30's, yet one could write the very same story today.  In fact I would like to see a skilled writer give it a shot!
0679423001|5.0|If you have a Little and Brown dated 1945 and it is the 1st American Edition, one of 600 predating the trade edition, that book in good condiion is worth several hundred or more. Even if yours states January 1946 and after the 600, it is still worth in the hundreds. If you see the words &quot;trial&quot; or &quot;examination&quot; then your book is in the hundreds category. Refer to Abebooks on this.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This album is an eye opener for the world it takes you off of the hum drum beat that we are used to. The words are inspiring and very up lifting.

The album from start to finish is about the truth and what we see and don't see in the society.

630575067X|1.0|How could Lucas have managed to so thoroughly kill everything that was cool about the original trilogy?  This movie is an overlong, poorly-written, horribly acted series of merchandising tie-ins.  (There might as well have been a flashing subtitle during the pod race sequence that said \\"BUY THE VIDEO GAME\\".)  \\"The Force\\", originally conceived as a manifestation of spiritual development, is now explained away as the result of tiny organisms living in a person's blood.  I hear that in Episode 2, Yoda grabs a light saber and starts carving people up -- the same Yoda who said \\"War does not make one great\\".  What's next, \\"Gandhi 2: Revenge of the Mahatma\\"?!?!  Lucas has obviously lost the instinct and talent he had while making the first 3 movies.<br />The last movie I can remember that was as disappointing as this when compared to the original was \\"Highlander 2\\", and as in the case of the Highlander movies, I'm going to do my best to pretend that the new sequels don't exist.
B000065V41|5.0|The songs in this movie tend to stick with you.  The first time I watched this movie I wasn't impressed - because I think the George C. Scott portrayal of Scrooge is the best. But the second veiwing - when I wasn't comparing it to any other Scrooge versions made it more likeable and eventually, over the years, it has become one of the only movies my family can agree on that they \\"have to\\" watch during Christmas.<br />\\"Where ever you find love, it feels like Christmas\\" is a sentiment that would do us all good throughout the rest of the year!

B000000ZGO|4.0|Don't be fooled by the number of tracks (four) - you definitely get your money's worth on this one.  Isaac Hayes really showcases his ability to rework standards by composers like Burt Bacharach and Jimmy Webb.  You would never believe these weren't written to be mellow grooving soul.  From the cynical, ironic, Gen-X perspective, the intro to &quot;Phoenix&quot; seems a little too long and silly, but by the last few minutes of the song, you finally see where he was going with it.

This was their major label debut, and I even remember hearing &quot;Kool Thing&quot; and &quot;Disappearer&quot; on the radio in Chicago. Don't think the whole thing is so radio-friendly - hear &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; as an example.  IF you like the more accessible stuff, you can start here and work your way forward in their catalog, or if you are more experimental, work your way back into their indie releases.  Or just jump around, what do I care?

B0000668IF|1.0|What a difference between albums - the last one nearly every single track was excellent while on this one 2 of the 18 tracks are ok with the rest as filler.  Shame on Moby who is talented but seems to have lost sight of what makes a good album.  And 18 tracks are way too much - should have focused on doing 8-11 great songs.  Give this one a skip.
0800196767|4.0|Finally, after looking all over to replace my kids' copy of one of their all time favorites with no luck, I found it, and for a reasonable price. Very happy with my purchase, little slow on the shipping, but well worth the wait. My children were very excited.
6305078491|5.0|Whereas Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc, 4 years this film's senior, is obsessed with showing the audience through close-ups and inventive framing, Vampyr is a film possessed of the perverse knowledge that the camera's eye is capable of exclusion.  Understanding this, Dreyer is able to create the idea of terror by suggesting it, rather than evoking.  The result is a chilling work that may fall numb on Hollywood viewers.  <br />Vampyr is presumably a film produced under UFA, as was Dreyer's film Mikael.  This allows me to make parallels to Fritz Lang that might otherwise be stretched.  Primarily I speak of the pervasion of the death's head, a symbol found in two of Lang's earliest films:  Der Mude Tod and Die Nibelungen.  (The former, in turn, is likened to Dreyer's Leaves From Satan's Book by film theorist Tom Gunning.)  In Lang this is a mechanical figure of destiny which is fought against with the heart, and to some avail.  In Dreyer, it is a biological figure pitted against the heart, to similar ends.  Both Vampyr and Der Mude Tod see lovers together at their finales.  Lang is simply the more modern of the two, and Dreyer (to me) the more compelling.      <br />There are also the ambigious perceptions of women.  Both seem strongly influenced by Nietzsche's (nearly contemporary) idea that women are capable of much and rarely acheive it, falling victim, instead, to the vampire male.  Dreyer, of course, reverts to Goethe after exploiting this, and the problem is found to be feminine.  Lang refuses this, even in Metropolis.  (Again, Lang proves more modern.)<br />As a talkie this film shows its auteur's history as a silent film maker.  Sound is only used when necessary.  There are intertitles.  There's a bit where a character reads from a book and the passages he reads are shown as intertitles, which I really enjoy.<BR>The unfortunate things are the subtitles - which are, as you've probably read, in a weird gothic font and take up half the screen with their Closed-Caption like backgrounds (intertitles also appear in this font - Germany gave up with the \\"gothic\\" type lettering during WW2 because it was so hard for non-natives to read.).  I'm not really sure how original the score is, either.  It seems as though the movie would be beyond belief without it, or with a more suited example (Einhorn's score for the Criterion Joan of Arc, for example).  And the picture quality is really poor, which can be expected.  But there are certain things which are strictly the fault of the production company.  For example, there are frames of the movie subtitled in other languages, presumably from previous releases used to produce this release.<br />Of Vampyr, Dreyer said:<BR>\\"I wanted to create the daydream on film and wanted to show that horror is not a part of the things around us, but of our own subconscious mind.\\"<br />What a remarkable job he did!  Lynch and Bergman, and a few dozen other names to which history has been more kind, owe a great deal to this film.
B00003CXQX|5.0|I love it! It was shipped quickly, case and movie both in excellent condion, couldn't be more pleased.
038533558X|5.0|Wow. That is all I can say. I started reading harlan Coben with Tell No One and could not wait until this was published. This is a dark story centered around our main character enjoying life, loving his job, his girlfriend, everything, but when his mother dies things start to unravel. His past is brought back to him: the rape and murder of his highschool girlfriend and the disappearance of his brother. When his current girlfriend vanishes the search begins leading up to an ending that will take you completely by surprise. I loved this book! I read it in one day, staying up all night to finish it because I was so scared I couldnt sleep anyway and so curious to find out what really happened that I couldnt wait.
B00005B36H|5.0|I've been a Tool fan for years and had high expectations for this CD (it definitely surpassed them).  This band is able to keep their origional, distinguishing tone and creatively build on it to produce new, uniquely amazing albums.  This is an incredibly collection of tracks and is one of the best ablums of all time.  I feel it would be premature to rank this album over any other Tool CD as it's still fresh (but will it ever cool down??).  The more I listen to it, the more I appreciate it's greatness.  IN SUMMARY: Anyone rating this CD less than 5 stars lacks competence.
B000002H33|5.0|Continuing in the direction of Ride the Lightning, in 1986 Metallica gave us Master of Puppets, widely regarded as their finest. The last album to showcase the talents of Cliff Burton(RIP) before his tragic death, Master of Puppets showed the entire band at the peak of their technical and creative talent. The album is full of Metallica classics like Battery, the title track, and Welcome Home (Sanitarium), However, I have one and only one bone to pick with this album, Orion. While many consider it to be one of the best Metallica songs ever, and it contains a phenomenal bass solo by Cliff, it simply can't compare to Ride the Lightning's Call of Ktulu. That said, if you don't hate metal(if you did why would you be here anyway?) and want some of the greatest ever recorded, get Master of Puppets now.
B000059MEK|4.0|This shouldn't be a CD - it should be an 8-track cassette.  Not that that's a bad thing at all.  When I heard &quot;Digital Love&quot; on a Gap commercial, I immediately went to my computer to find out who performed it.  Approximately 1 hour later, I found not only did Daft Punk perform &quot;Digital Love,&quot; but they also performed the great &quot;One More Time.&quot;  <br />Daft Punk specialize in 70s-80s infused electronica.  The songs sound very much like songs from those decades, but they also have a particular 2000s feel as well.  I especially love &quot;Aerodynamic,&quot; &quot;Superheroes,&quot; and of course, &quot;Digital Love.&quot;  This album does take some getting used to, but I found that after I listened to it a couple times, most of the songs grew on me (except &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; - still can't stand that one).  Also, if you like Daft Punk, check out &quot;Lady (Hear Me Tonight)&quot; by Modjo---great tune and in the style of Daft Punk!
B0000668IF|4.0|Hard to believe its been three years since Moby's gargantuan Play was released. It never really went away;the singles kept coming, the commercials kept rolling, and Moby became the most wanted in all forms of media.... Critics have scoffed at Moby's cashing in on nearly every track on Play. A TV theme here and a sneaker commerical there, Moby also became the subject of mass speculation that he couldn't follow up Play's great success. Hardly. 18 is as accessible as Play, without making Play part 2. There will probably be a few who will groan when hearing Moby's signature piano/techno pieces; you would think he even had enough of them-but after a few listens songs, like \\"In This World\\" and \\"One Of These Mornings\\" will stick, as do most of Moby's soft, heartfelt music. 18 samples more modern soul than Play; a 70s late night radio dedication show if you will. 18 doesnt provide as much dance this time around, but there are certainly things to groove and nod your head too. Most of the songs are melancholy, which is not a bad thing. \\"Rafters\\" sounds like the old school Moby in his \\"Go\\" days, and speaking of old school, theres \\"Jam For The Ladies\\" with Angie Stone and MC Lyte; they kick a good groove but lose a little steam afer awhile. Moby is deeply introspective, maybe more then Play with September 11th as his muse. \\"Sunday (the day before my birthday)\\" is obviously about the tragedy, and while not many songs can convey the emotion about the war, Moby's effort pays off in a beautiful, soul searching way. Thats pretty much the whole album, which does have its share of dullness. The first single(why?)\\"We Are All Made Of Stars\\" doesn't fall too hard on its face, but compared to the other tracks, one has to wonder where it fits in the equation. Still despite the rough spots, Moby has once again made a great record and any fear that he can't follow this up can only be answered by track 18: \\"I'm Not Worried At All\\".
B00005U1YO|5.0|The great thing about The Chems is that their albums do very little for me at first, but exhibit deep musical talent and artistry that make me curious enough to keep listening until I am head over heels in love with their work.  An underlying beacon of good taste and exceptional beats ... the infection sets in and you are hooked.  Give it a listen for the sheer beauty of 'Star Guitar' and 'My Elastic Eye', the two most interestingly woven together and underrated songs of the album.  'My Elastic Eye' makes my eyes stretch in their sockets every time I hear it!  For a while, I heard Galaxy Bounce on so many soundtracks and radio stations, I thought I could never hear that song again ... and now, after having discovered the album on my own terms, I play that song to get me going almost everyday.  'The Test' is not a favorite, but it is the last song and by that time you've received your money's worth.  So, get the album, and be warned, when those deep bass beats enter you, they aren't going to leave.  Catch The Chems live if you can; they will NOT disappoint!
B00005U122|5.0|I bought this DVD thinking I'd be automatically disappointed as I thought nothing could top the reincarnation of Pink Floyd and their \\"Pulse\\" tour.  Was I ever surprised to sit through this wonder of a concert!  There are just not enough artists out there anymore who convey the emotional depth of a Roger Waters.  As someone who has always resented the emphasis on Waters to Pink Floyd, I never listened to his solo stuff.  I can guarantee you that will change.  Amused to Death is a dynamic song sung by someone who has all but apologized for his spitting in the face of a fan at Olympic Stadium in Montreal(?)  Though his vocals falter a bit, he nevertheless is clear and concise in his vision of a world that doesn't always look pretty.  If only one final reunion tour could be organized.
B00005OAIE|1.0|It doesn't get much worse than this.  Imagine the Backstreet Boys broke up, took up the guitar, and hit the road.  Voila- John Mayer.  Granted, this kid is a fantastic guitar player- but you'd never know that from the album.  Only occasionally when he plays live will he show off those chops for you, and then he is amazing.  But here, you wouldn't know him from Hootie.<br />His song writing is simply mediocre.  He sings songs of high school loss and woe and lack of love with such little passion- almost like he didn't really WANT to sing these songs, but if you insist...  Most of the songs sound like he's just trying to make the words rhyme, not actually convey some form of emotion.  But, of course, he's not looking to tap into the crowd of acoustic music-listeners that want meaning and depth to their songs- he's gunning more for the 14-to-19-year-old set, who all believe he knows &quot;exactly what they're thinking.&quot;<br />If you're looking for an involving, emotional, heart-tugging album, this ain't it.  Looking for something of that sort?  Pick up some Indigo Girls, or, if you'd rather hear a fella, try Jeff Buckley- THOSE songs are beautiful in a way that these will never be.
630575067X|5.0|After reading several of the 2032 reviews of The Phantom Menace I can see where the purist would find this movie disappointing. But allow me to present an alternative view. <br />I recently bought this tape for my son and after watching it I was reminded of what attracted my generation to the Star Wars phenomenon in the first place; it is a fantastically fun film series that has never failed to excite us and keep us on the edge of our seats! <br />It took watching the wonderment on my 8 year old's face to make me cognizant of the fact that this movie makes no claim on having any greater depth of meaning than what you see. Annakin Skywalker by far steals the show, along with the sometimes irksome Jar-Jar Binks. <br />My advice to you if you have been hesitating to watch this, or any of the other &quot;sequels&quot; is to go ahead and do it! You won't be disappointed if you can keep in mind why you fell in love with George Lucas' work in the first place.<br />But if you want to be like so many of the 2000+ reviewers and take a foray into the world of pedantry, looking for some deep cosmic, esoteric significance in every nook and cranny of the film, you will indeed be disappointed.
B00005QDW1|1.0|For people as old as they, they have no emotional maturity.  The album's first single, Hey Baby, talks about how the band abuses and objectifies groupies back stage.  Is a man in his thirties sleeping with a girl who is 18 something to be proud of?
B000062TU1|5.0|(I got the DVD not in USA, but I guess the content will be the same)<br />Okay, it is a good film, and the DVD is even greater! Firstly, there is Disc 1: Movie. You can acess trailers in this disc. <br />Second, there is Disc 2: Special Features. You get to go around the world of Harry Potter, exploring Diagon Alley and Hogwarts. You can find a LOT of stuff, including the designs for the Quidditch pitch, etc..<BR>THIS IS NOT IT. What is more, you can watch the Deleted Scenes (yeah!!). The price is, you HAVE to explore the Diagon Alley, Hogwarts Classrooms, the Forbidden Corridor, and THEN you get acess to the Deleted Scenes. The only bad thing is that you have to do it ALL OVER AGAIN if you wanted to see it again. That means, it won't save your memory. Too bad about this.
B00003Q43A|4.0|After having read some of the other reviews of this movie, I am almost ashamed to say how much I enjoy it.  Oh well!! <br />It is many of the things the others complain about, a very typical Hollywood mid-summer special effects, over the top, action flick. However I do find it entertaining if you want an evening of fairly mindless enjoyment.<br />The special effects are good for their time, and still hold up fairly well.  The plot line (what there is) is predictable. The acting is mediocre thru ok.<br />Will Smith is just fine for me as a Marine Corps fighter pilot.  Some of his lines are a little much, but he and Jeff Goldblum work well off of each other.<br />Jeff Goldblum (whom I normally do not care for) is good as a typical science nerd, save the planet freak.  I for once actully enjoyed his part in a movie.<br />The Randy Quaid role could and should have been completely rewritten.  I understand what they were trying to do with him, however it is almost embarresing to watch some of his scenes. I hope he was paid lots of money for going thru this.<br />The likable Bill Pullman as President of the US....Hmmm I am still working on that. He gives the best he's got, and comes across as a decent choice for the role, but I really do feel that the role could have been cast more beleivably.<br />The most likable characters are the 'second tier' actors.  Judd Hirsch, and Robert Loggia stand out in my mind as really fullfilling their tasks in the movie.<br />If you buy this movie in the DVD format, choose to watch the version with the \\"cut\\" scenes in it.  It makes alot more sense and seems to flow better.<br />While I wouldnt put ID4 in my list of must see movies, it aint all that bad either.
B00000099Y|5.0|i especially like the song where he doesn't really want to dance with his girlfriend, but does anyway, because he's nice.  he blew me a kiss in concert.  i wish he'd come to my school and read a story before naptime.  i like things that relax me.  has anybody seen my puppy?
B00000F14B|5.0|I am a child (total misnomer) of the 60's.  Growing up and being devoted to the rock music of the late '50 and beyond. Having said that, I am still trying to figure out why &quot;The Music Man&quot; is my all time favorite movie.<br />I remember when the movie came out and my parents and grandparents tried to get me to go see it.  Of course I refused. I discovered this movie on VHS in the mid '80s and have become totally enthralled.<br />Hollywood musicals have never been my cup of tea, but this....oh my this movie is WONDERFUL.<br />The incomparable Robert Preston is totally enthralling as Professor Harold Hill, a con man par excellance.  A young and very beautiful Shirley Jones is Marion the Librarian.  Add in Buddy Hacket, Hermione Gingold, Paul Ford, and a 7 year old red headed kid named Ron Howard and you get a cast from heaven.<br />The sets and costumes recreate a circa 1910 Iowa perfectly, the story moves along seamlessly, and the score is superb.  Movie magick at its best.<br />The chemistry between Robert Preston and Shirley Jones is perfect, the inter-action of the other characters is very well done.  The score by Meredith Wilson is pure musical heaven.<br />Buy it, watch it, watch it again.  You will love it. Guaranteed.
0790729725|1.0|First of all let me start off by saying that the 1 star is not for the movie itself.  The single star is for the DVD version because the movie is on 2 sides!  That's right!  Just like a laser disk.  When my friend told me it was on two sides I thought there was a widescreen and full screen version on each side, which is very common on older DVD's.  But no, halfway through the movie you have to get up and flip the movie to finish watching it.  It this a big deal? YES!  It is a DVD, the form of media that was supposed to do away with such nonsense.  Completely unacceptable! 1 star!
B00005RY7X|5.0|The 12 tracks on this album are guaranteed to please. It's like being on a roller coaster that never stops going up. Music that will get your pulse racing, and thrill you like no other. I can't say enough praise for this album! I love it!
B00005T30L|5.0|I'm not gonna write a huge review, but if you haven't read &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, read the book &amp; see this movie.  The two have a bunch of similarities.  Enid reminds me of Holden Caufield, walking through the city, and flunking school.  Some of the deeper themes about loneliness and fitting in are also prevalent.  I don't want to give away too much about the movie, but I remember in &quot;Catcher&quot;, Holden went to buy a specific record for his sister... that reminded me of the movie.  Enid's language, calling everyone an a**-hole reminds me of how Holden called everyone a &quot;phony&quot;.  Just a whole bunch of stuff.  Anyway, this is a good decent movie.  Watch it.
0385484518|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie: An Old Man, a Young Man, and Life's Greatest Lesson by: Mitch Albom. Is a really great book for anyone that is looking for something that can help him or her through life when it gets hard. Tuesdays with Morrie starts off as a teacher who watches his student Mitch through college and then Mitch watches his teacher struggle through a life threatening dieses.<BR> I rated this book a five out of five because I think it is a book that every person it the world should read some time in his or her life. It helps you get a view on how much life is good, how some people waste their lives, and how people can enjoy the time they have on Earth. I thought that it helps me understand that death isnt a bad thing, but a good thing especially if you have lived the life that you wanted to. It helps people  understand that death isnt always a bad things and good things can come from it. <BR> It helps you understand how important life is to us. When Morrie was dying he explained why we should do what we dream of doing and make sure we get a chance to do things that we want to before we are on our death bed. I think that live was given to us to live it the way we want to and not the way others want us to live it.<BR> This also goes along with the first reason but we should be able to enjoy what we like doing on Earth. Even if it means you have to be in a bed to enjoy it. Other people shouldnt take that right away from you. You are you and that is the only person that can boss you around.<BR> Some people on this planet that we call Earth. They just want to screw up their lives and in the book Morrie does a good job of doing that. But I will let you read it and not spoil it.  They want to waste themselves with using things and not doing anything with there lives.<BR> These are all reasons why I think this book should be read by everyone in the world.
B000063K62|2.0|I loved both &quot;Slacker&quot; and &quot;dazed and confused&quot;, so I thought I'd appreciate &quot;Waking Life&quot;.  It is an animated film that revels in philosophical conversations and dream sequences.  That is all this movie is; there is no plot.  It's just Wiley Wiggins, who was in &quot;Dazed&quot;, floating around talking to different people about life.  Is he dreaming? Is he awake? I don't know nor do I care.  I think it was the animation itself that turned me off this movie.  It was too out of control, and to try and catch the conversation and the animation is virtually impossible. THis is better as an audio commentary. Just listen to the conversations, which were actually pretty interesting, and not watch the animation. Unless you are a serious animation fan that appreciate all kinds of animation, I don't think you will fully appreciate this movie. I thought I would just because it was a Linklater film, but I was sorely disappointed.<br />Many of the &quot;voices&quot; are actors from Linklater's previous effort, &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;.
0553573403|4.0|I'm not a big fan of the fantasy genre. With few exceptions, I've found it to be loaded with overblown series composed of overwritten stories. When I first A Game of Thrones at a local bookstore, I assumed, by its girth, that it fit in the same category. Then, a couple of friends were talking about how good the series is. I read the first book and, I have to say, I was wrong to place it in with your typical Fantasy series. Its that good. Why? Well...<br />Most fantasy worlds are peopled (creatured?) with a variety of different races of creatures (Elves, dwarves, giants, etc.) all engaged in an epic quest of some sort. Usually involving magic. The magic and fantasic creatures are here, but in a minor way, perfect to be expanded upon in future books.<br />A Game of Thrones is set in a feudalistic society and reads like a story of historical fiction set during our Medieval period. Its a story of power, those who want it and the intrigue surrounding the achieving of it.<br />The characters themselves are very life-like. They each have their own beliefs and goals which they follow as a real person would. The bad guys are extremely ruthless in the pursuit of power and do whatever strikes them. When in a position to harm the good guys, they don't stand around mouthing pages of exposition until the author can find some way to rescue him. The antagonist will do what he feels necessary and move on. The good guys also perform in a similar manner, but with a bit more constraint. Most characters also change their behavior and beliefs according to what has happened to them. A point of warning: People behave here just as people have always done in the real world, for good and bad. If you don't like reading about violence, incest or sex (including with minors) then you may want to stay away. I'm not saying these things are a large part of the bool, but they are there and they do reflect how people do act in reality. Again, this is way the characters seem real. The act the way real people do.<br />There is no epic quest or overriding prophecy that is being adhered to. Which isn't a bad thing. Its all about achieving the throne. Martin has done a commendable job in creating his world, populating it with believable characters, and filling out at least 8000 years of history to give his world a deep sense of texture. Which leads me to my only criticism of this book. I feel that Martin has a tendency to be a bit overlong in his descriptions. I found myself skipping several sentences at a time to get to the good stuff. Which is really good.<br />This book will pull you in and make you want to read, to the exclusion of anything else, until its finished. But that's a good thing since there are 5 more books to go!people do.<br />There is no epic quest or overriding prophecy that is being adhered to. Which isn't a bad thing.

0440234743|4.0|The book that I have reviewed is The Testament by John Grisham. It is a book about a man who had at one time all of the toys; the yachts, a jet, the blondes, the houses in Europe, and farms in Argentina, and much more. He owns a fourteen-floor glass building downtown, and it holds 97 percent of his company. He has three ex-wives and seven children. All of them are just trying to get money from him when he dies. Hes such an old man he shouldnt be hating people but he cant help it. Well, when he is on the verge of death he has rewritten his will. He has left his 11 billion dollar company in the hands of a mysterious woman named Rachel Lane. She is a missionary in the jungles of Brazil. The story gets a twist in it when she doesnt want to accept the generous inheritance.<BR>     This books content is so amazing. It is one of the best books that I have ever read. The characters are so well built. It feels like you actually know the character.
B00004YA66|5.0|What can I say about Dennis Quaid! I just watched him in Traffic, where he played a sleaze. In Frenquency, he played a loving and devoted father and husband at home and a guy's guy at work and at play (baseball). He pulled both of them off with flying colors. When he's straight and sincere you can't help but to feel it. When he played the \\"baddie\\", you can't help but to feel the chill. He can be showy yet he can be subtle. What a great actor! Don't miss The Rookie ... for another one of his grounded and realistic performance.
B0000636UN|5.0|I have a category of music that I call &quot;True Art&quot;.  It's when a song can so vividly bring me back to a time and place in my past and bring out feelings about that time and place that I either forgot or never fully realized.  Several of the tracks on this CD &quot;brought me back&quot; in this way.  You had to be there to appreciate it, but boy, Sheryl knows how to express it well.  Anyway...I love just about every track on this CD.  I also happen to be a fan of most of her &quot;guest stars&quot; (Liz Phair, Lenny Kravitz, Don Henley).  Just buy it...especially if you are already a Sheryl Crow fan.
0385503954|3.0|&quot;Atonement&quot; is, as noted in the other reviews posted online, a beautifully written novel.  The three distinct sections are really set pieces, capturing events that resonate throughout the lives of the main characters.  The images of English country life, pre-blitz London and the hospital in which much of the action takes place are as vivid as cinema.  (The love scene is hauntingly captured, too.)  But this is perhaps the most depressing novel I have read since &quot;Of Human Bondage.&quot;  Next time I crave an onset of the blues, I'll pick up else something by this craftsman and see if he bludgeons his characters again as he did here.  Geez...
B0000028VT|5.0|I've given this album a review already, but I was outragged to read one of the reviews.  It said this is were here music began to slide.  Now I can understand why some fans might not like her hip hop albums, which are good too, but how could they complain about this album.  This is the best album she are anyone has done followed closely by Usher's 8701.  Her albums Glitter, Mariah, and Emotions are in second.  Mariah and Emotions are almost as good,but there songs get old quicker than Musicbox's.  Now Glitter what be better than Musicbox if I did not have to skip some of the songs.  The only not great album she has done in my opinion is Daydream.
0525946284|2.0|As an aficionado of epsionage books (fiction and non) i must say it was an &quot;ok&quot; book, but that author really doesnt have much of an idea about the SOE/OSS or resistance during WWII, nor is he good at description of the characters or how they act, maybe he should stick to whatever he normally write, Espionage books are definately not his speciality.
B00005JKBC|4.0|incredible actions scenes and acting. the filming style is very modern and artistic. awesome movie, funny and entertaining.
0881033995|4.0|A cute book that teaches kids about manners and helping out.
0876852630|4.0|\\"Factotum,\\" the novel by Charles Bukowski, describes the wanderings of aspiring writer Henry Chinaski across the United States during the World War II era. Categorized as \\"4-F,\\" Chinaski doesn't serve in the military and instead wanders from city to city, from one odd job to another. Along the way Bukowski describes his run-ins with the police, his sexual adventures, and his drinking.<br />I found \\"Factotum\\" to be episodic and to lack the focus and impact of Bukowski's excellent novel \\"Post Office,\\" also featuring Chinaski. But \\"Factotum\\" is still a good read with some really stunning passages. Bukowski seems to be deromanticizing the \\"myth of the starving artist,\\" which he calls a \\"hoax,\\" in this book. I only wish that \\"Factotum\\" featured more about Chinaski's vocation as a writer; I found the parts of the book that focused on his identity as a writer to be the most interesting parts.<br />\\"Factotum\\" is particularly interesting in its context as a novel of the World War II era which deals with the U.S. homefront, but in an entirely unromantic and detached way. Bukowski's prose is often quite vivid; one encounter with a rather scary prostitute is a particular gem of Bukowski's raw, in-your-face style. Overall, a solid work by one of America's most distinctive writers.
B00004THAY|4.0|Well, what else can really be said? This album is great! Putting King and Clapton together for a project is bound to stir something up, and that's definitely the case here! Anyone who has said that this album lacks passion is either deaf or stupid (or both). While it's true that the advancement of time and age may have taken their toll on them somewhat, neither of them have lost one ounce of the edge and fire that has made them living legends. Interestingly, King in particular digs out an old chestnut or two from his past, such as \\"Help The Poor\\", a little-known gem from the classic \\"Live At The Regal\\"; the absolute highlight of this album is the superb vocal and guitar showcasing exchanged from both on \\"3 O'Clock Blues\\", which was King's first hit record in the early 50's.<br />The guitar playing and vocal delivery from both King and Clapton are outstanding, but at times, King's voice is a little raspy. This is very small criticism, when you consider that King still to this day plays in excess of 300 shows a year, records, and so forth--a standing tribute to a 77-year old living legend, God bless him! Let's see any of today's young whippersnappers try to handle THAT kind of schedule!<br />This is a great CD...nothing more to say!
0060931671|5.0|Thomas Pynchon's novel \\"The Crying of Lot 49\\" is an often funny gem of absurdist fiction. It follows the odd quest of Oedipa Maas, the wife of a California disc jockey. As the story begins, she is made executor of the will of Pierce Inverarity. This responsibility leads her to seek the truth behind a centuries' old international conspiracy. Along the way, she encounters a number of weird characters and bizarre historical revelations.<br />Part of the fun of \\"Lot\\" is the wild jumble of cultural references that Pynchon throws into the mix: a Tupperware party, Cornell University, Muzak, Fu-Manchu, Perry Mason, LSD -- and those are all from the first chapter! He tosses about such names as Warpe, Wistfull, Kubitschek and McMingus (that's a law firm). His whimsical characters include a former child star-turned-lawyer, a specialist on Jacobean revenge tragedies, and a proselytizer for the Peter Pinguid Society.<br />\\"Lot\\" reflects on such topics as U.S. history, pop culture, religion, politics, and mail delivery. It's strange, inventive, brainy, and fun. Recommended as companion texts: \\"Principia Discordia\\" and Charles Bukowski's \\"Post Office.\\"

0060975768|5.0|I was 8 years old when the battle of Ia Drang took place. Vietnam was a faraway place I had never heard of. This book brings it home. There are scenes of great heroism and tragedy. Ia Drang was one of the bloodiest battles fought by American soldiers in the post-WW II era. While the new movie starring Mel Gibson tells some of the story, there is a great deal more to be learned in the book.<br />However, the most moving part of the book comes towards the end as the lives of the wives and parents and children are impacted. They are informed by telegram that their husband, son or father is missing or killed in action. The commentaries are heart rendering.<br />Vietnam scarred my generation, and we have been treated to too many hopeless accounts. This book is different. This book tells the story of heroes. There is no shame, no bug stomping crazy people, no vulgar accounts. This is the story of men who bled, died and fought because they believed in the dream that is America. They went because they were  ordered to go. They fought because that was their job.<br />It is not pretty, but it is the truth unvarnished by political correctness. Read the book, you owe the warriors at Ia Drang that much.
B0000668IF|2.0|So here we have Moby post-Sept. 11th, post-Play and post-mega-stardom.  Sadly all three of these factors play greatly into the rather milquetoast release that is \\"18\\".<br />Here Moby seems to have recycled most of the ideas that made \\"Play\\" so great, but in a much more subdued manner.  There seems to be sorrow all over this release, which one can only surmise has something to do with living in a post-Sept. 11th world (as referenced on \\"Sunday Before My Birthday\\" and \\"Sleep Alone\\"), and while sorrow does not make for bad music, it does when it is mixed with tunes that are set to sell the latest car models.  As a result Moby rufuses to go full out in any direction and we are left with a virtually lifeless release; it is hard not to nod off during a few of the tracks.<br />Not all is lost though, \\"We are All Made of Stars\\" is a refreshing number that sounds like Joy Division if Ian Curtis had been an optimist.  And some tracks mirror the grace of the gospel tinged \\"Play\\".  But often those tracks are simply a retread of ideas found on \\"Play\\" and \\"Everything is Wrong\\".  <br />This is the sound of Moby treading water, and while it is not terrible, it is not great either.  At most one can say it is pleasant, but who wants pleasant?  At worst, Moby's inertness causes some tracks to drown.  This may sell millions, but hopefully Moby will worry more about musical progression rather than the bottom line and produce something worthwhile the next time around.
0790737345|5.0|This is one of the movies that I will never stop seeing in my life.
0743216458|4.0|Once again, Stephen Ambrose gives a realistic account of battle during WWII.<br />I became interested in this book after seeing the trailer for the HBO Miniseries of the same name.  I bought the book and read it in a matter of days.  The book chronicles \\"Easy Company\\" of the 101st Airborne division in WWII.  They had some of the hardest assignments and among the highest rate of death in the Army during the war.<br />The book follows Easy company from their training to Hitler's Eagle's nest.  Ambrose does a good job of describing the horrific events that the soldiers of Easy went through and how this formed a bond that made the a \\"Band of Brothers.\\"<br />I liked the book.  I would not run out and buy it, but if it is laying around I would pick it up.  My major issue was with the emphasis on the Battle of the Bulge.  A good portion of the book is devoted to The Bulge and it slows down the pace of reading.  There are a lot of details that make for mundane reading.<br />Overall, Band of Brothers is a solid effort by Ambrose, but comes up a bit short.
B00005K3OT|3.0|This is a movie that many find too slight, but it is nonetheless entertaining and a little touching. If you expect too much, perhaps the picture disappoints. If you take it for what it is--a pleasant diversion that reflects on the life's fearful tightness--then it is a small gem. Well worth owning.
0743420373|5.0|In \\"The Millionaire Next Door,\\" Thomas Stanley reveals the surprising secrets of America's wealthy.  After tabulating the results of many surveys of America's millionaires, Stanley delivers them to us in a nice package that is easy to read.<br />As a college student, this book changed my life.  Stanley makes a very good case for making it to millionaire status through hard work and fiscal discipline, not harebrained schemes and cushy jobs.<br />Stanley tells us that everything we have been made to believe about millionaires is untrue.  Most of them don't drive flashy cars or have six-figure salaries.  The do not wear expensive suits and Rolex watches.  They are regular people who have worked hard and saved their money.  They have avoided the traps of credit card debt and bought late model used cars paid for with cash.<br />I think everyone should read this book, especially young people.  It will start you on the right path to millionaire status by teaching you that the way to get there is by saving, not spending.
B00004Y87O|5.0|...but I bought this DVD anyway!  What a great movie!
0679735909|4.0|A.S. Byatt has pulled off a stunning achievement with her Booker Prize-winning novel - excuse me, ROMANCE - entitled Possession.  Some, like myself, may find it tedious at times, especially if you are not a fan of Victorian epic poetry, with which Byatt opens many of her chapters and fills dozens upon dozens of pages.  But quality literature is worth the effort, and this is indeed quality literature.  If at first the poetic interludes frustrate you, give yourself time to appreciate them.  By the end you will realize how much texture and flavor they add to a beautifully woven literary tapestry.<br />Possession is the story of two young scholars, Roland and Maud,whose paths cross when they realize that the poets they are researching - Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte, respectively - may have had a brief yet passionate affair.  Through recently discovered journal entries, letters, and poems, the two scholars follow a trail of clues that they hope will lead them to a profound discovery.  The plot thickens as an overzealous American scholar attempts to woo the holder of these manuscripts in an attempt to remove them from England and store them at his university's library across the pond.<br />Possession is reminiscent of the best of 19th century British fiction.  It is filled with an overwhelming feeling of period authenticity.  Byatt masterfully blends poetry with prose in a way few authors can.  And as a result she has produced a work of immense beauty that will be treasured for years to come.
0440416027|4.0|The book Skellig by David Almond is a wonderful book that fits a big age group.  The younger readers will like the mystery, and the older readers will like how it makes you look deeper into life.  This book is about a family who moves into a new house that theyre going to fix up. Their son, Michael, meets a girl named Mina and they become close friends and hang out together most of the time.  Together they go exploring and they find a body that they think is dead and has cobwebs and bluebottles all over it.  When they take the jacket off the body, named Skellig, they find out that he has wings underneath.  Michaels sister is sick and has to have a heart surgery right away to save her life.  If the surgery doesnt work, Joy wont live.  There are three main reasons why I would recommend this book. First, it has great suspense that always keeps you on the edge of you seat.  Throughout part of the book, I was wondered whether the baby was going to live or not.  When they do a sudden heart surgery, they add even more suspense!  Second, this book is the child adventure that you dreamed of, by finding a mysterious thing in your garage that turns out to be alive and you end up taking care of it.  Mina and Michael always snuck out to the garage to feed him because he was so stiff he couldnt move.  Third, this book makes you look deeper into life and shows you that everything has a purpose and meaning.  Skelligs purpose in the book isnt to provide Michael and Mina excitement and adventure; its also to show them the power of love.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|I listened to the soundtrack at a friends house and was amazed by the powerful sounds...those violins continued to play in my head for days afterward.

B00005RY7X|5.0|The first time I saw Andrew WK's video for &quot;Party Hard&quot; on MTV2, I was captivated by his energy and the overall positive vibe of the music. About a week later, I made the trip to the record store and picked up a copy of &quot;I Get Wet&quot;. Needless to say, I've been hooked on this album since day one. This album, my friends is a party album in celebration of that wonderful thing we call life. The catchy riffage/beats, combined with the lyrics and AWK's &quot;angry metal guy&quot; vocals will leave you pumping your fists, banging your head and trying to pull off Andrew's famous &quot;rock star&quot; kicks. Songs such as &quot;She is Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Party Til You Puke&quot; are surefire hits, packed with energy and an overall sense of fun. <BR>If you dig the happy music and live to party, then pick this album up or miss out on the biggest celebration known to mankind.
B00005RY7X|5.0|I couldn't believe the news when I heard AWK's &quot;I Get Wet&quot; was coming out soon.  I was already a huge fan of his &quot;Girls Own Juice&quot; ep and needed more of his music in a bad way.  I was awed when I heard &quot;I Get Wet&quot; was already huge in England.  I soon knew why.  This album has become the soundtrack to my life.  It has the power of metal and punk combined with an anthemetic, inspiring, unstoppable force. The guitar is like a mack truck with 3 jet engines smashing anything in it's way, perfectly tempered with anthemetic piano.  Andrew is behind the wheel with an almost unhuman power in his voice.  &quot;I Get Wet&quot; will blast your brain with feelings of pride, courage, longing, revenge and hope, to name a few.  Play it in the morning with your coffee then throw yourself head-long into the world.  Play it at night at a party, and it is sure to be one for the record books.  Get Wet.  Live hard.  Get the album.
B00005QEO1|5.0|In a time of excess rock,pop metal, and hairspray only two bands were holding it down for that bluesy nasty rock n roll. Guns N Roses and Aerosmith. Aerosmith came back to set everything straight. This album had everything that the Aerosmith of the 70's had and more. Every track is a classic to the die-hard Aerosmith fans, but not since Toys in the Attic had Aerosmith had any strong singles. \\"Love In An Elevator\\", \\"Janie's Got a Gun\\", \\"What It Takes\\" and \\"The Other Side\\" were all huge singles. So this album will definetly be adored by the fans who only liked the singles, and also the fans who dug songs like \\"My Girl\\" and \\"FINE\\". Treat yourself right now!!!
B000066C1N|3.0|This soundtrack could have been really great, but they asked Bryan Adams to do it, someone else would have been better, Adams is a bit whiny.

B0000668IF|5.0|Being a die-hard Moby fan, I would expect nothing less than excellence from his most recent album - and it delivered.<br />A lot more subtle and ambient than it's predecessor \\"Play\\", it actually reminds me more of his album, ironically titled \\"Ambient\\".  There is an unmistakeable quality that stands out among Moby's work and \\"18\\" is no exception.<br />Just as inspiring as the music he produced in this album is the message that he wrote on the inside cover.  <br />Kudos, Moby - keep up the good work.
0446605409|4.0|At the time, Max, town sheriff in this Long Island community, thought it was a good idea to ask convalescing NYPD homicide detective, John Corey, to help out with a double-murder case. After all, this one is way out of local boys' league. <br />The murdered couple just happens to be scientists employed on mysterious Plum Island. A compound where the government does its top secret studies of animal diseases (y'know like anthrax and Ebola, the real fun stuff). The plot thickens when some government spooks try to keep things quiet, and did I mention the female detective who is really supposed to be in charge of the case. <br />They just didn't know what they were dealing with when Corey got involved. Demille fans know what I'm talking about. <br />While, mystery/suspense novels aren't my favorite reading preference, I'll always pick up a Demille book. His heroes are the macho, stand-up guy, shove the politically correct [stuff], man's man, types that, unfortunately, are so scarce now-a-days, they should be on an endangered species list.<br />This story makes a very surprising turn about half-way through that you'll never see coming and like him or not, Corey is just the man to see justice done.
B00005NGAL|3.0|The addition of post produciton special effects and poor camera work make this produciton of the musical a real let down.<br />Sure if you love the musical the video is good. But if I wanted special effects I would just go to the movies, I would not be watching a broadway style musical.<br />The cast is not as good as the origianl broadway cast on the CD. The constant closeups do nothing for the costumes or coregraphy, which were designed for the stage not the camera.<br />If you like Cats, you'll probably enjoy the DVD. But you also be disspointed when comparing it with the live show.

Another book I would recommend is The Kissing Hand by Audrey Penn.  This is a book about sending your child to school for the first time.  You'll love this book if you liked Love You Forever!
031286504X|4.0|I liked this book but i listened to it on audio and it isn't very long. I think the story could have become broader and the story could have been longer. Also, i think there are segments of the story that were not totally explored, such as the vampire virus where it came from etc. Overall it was a good classic vampire story especially for the time it was written in , i believe it was copyrighted in 1954.

B00005RY7X|4.0|Thank God someone is here to save Rock and Roll. Andrew W.K.'s I Get Wet is what a Rock and Roll album should be. No Whining, No bitching, and NO songs about bad parents. Just hard rock tunes about partying hard and beautiful women. I Get Wet is chocked full of kick [bootie] riffs and choruses that get stuck in your head for weeks. I Get Wet is one the best albums I have heard in a long time. I would recommend this album to any rock fan and swear you will not be able to take it out of your CD player.
0920668364|5.0|It's good to find a book that affects you on the first, second, and even the hundredth reading.  I cry every time I read Love You Forever.  I give it as a shower gift to new moms.  There is always a loud \\"AAAWWWW!\\" when the gift is opened.  It holds a special place in the hearts of everyone who has read it.  I recommend this book to all new moms and to their children too.  What a fine example of the unconditional, undying love of a mother for her child!  Another \\"good cry\\" book about love to which my children enjoy listening is A Dog Like Jack.
0385484518|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  This book makes us realize many issues in life that we do not have time to think about.  It has many explanations on why people do what the society do.  It also teaches us to think about things that we don't normally think about such as dealing with dying and death.

6302769051|5.0|Although I don't like cowboy movies but this movie seen nice to me. It had some nice parts, some bad part and many different Motions. If I rate this movie it would be an R because there are some scenes that kids can't watch. Like sex, valence, starvation and etc. There are some ladies in the town for sex and they get money for that. Western films have always featured gunplay between the good guys and bad guys, but traditionally, it was kind of a softened violence. You shoot somebody, he falls down cleanly. No pain, no blood, and no real responsibility or consequence placed anywhere. When maverick director (Sam Peckinpah) arrived on the scene, he gave the world a taste of a Western movie most weren't ready for one where bullets actually hurt and spilled blood, and one where the killer often had to watch his dying prey struggle for a last breath. He plays Will Munny, an aging farmer who looks and sounds nothing like the heartless gunslinger he's reputed to be. Throughout the films, we learn bits and pieces of the Munny legend, but have a hard time ascribing it to this careworn man who can barely ride a horse now. \\"I ain't like that anymore,\\" he protests over and over again. <BR>Directed by (Clint Eastwood). Eastwood puts in an excellent performance as the retired killer Muny, saved from his life of thievery and murder by his late wife. Now, he really trying to support his children with no income, he is tempted back to his killing ways by the detective offered by the women of a brothel, one of whom's number has been badly beaten and disfigured by a drunken ranch-hand.<BR> The film follows Eastwood as he wrestles with his desire to honour his wife's memory and his need to feed his children by returning to the killer that, he fears, is his true nature. Meanwhile word of the bounty has spread and the events spiral out of control as the sheriff (Gene Hackman) deals with the guns for hire that ride into town.<BR> While all the supporting cast are excellent Gene Hackman's Oscar winning performance even manages to eclipse Eastwoods as the brutal Sheriff. He beats one of the bounty hunters, English Bob (Richard Harris) almost to death and then explains to a journalist, in one of the film's stand out scenes, how men like he and Muny are so successful at killing. The mood moves from light banter to life threatening seriousness...and back again, with just one move of his head.<BR>One of the greatest Westerns ever made? Certainly. Although the fact it's a western is really secondary. In truth it's a tale of the nature of evil and the nature of man. <BR>Overall, though, this film is indeed worth of the accolades it received. One more I would like to offer, this is one of Clint Eastwood's finest performances ever. His acting is largely what makes Munny so real to us, and thereby makes the movie's message that much more powerful. But the entire cast is first rate, starting with Gene Hackman, who earned his second Academy Award for his work in this film. And, of course, the always excellent (Morgan Freeman) and Richard Harris, who has a couple of the movie's best scenes.  As I mention before this movie was great mostly for adults. It had more valences, killing each other badly.
0800129806|4.0|Connery slips well into the role of King Arthur, a dignified hero but with a hint of vulnerability. The movie concentrates on the personal relationships between Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot, and while this isn't the most interesting aspect of Arthurian tales, it is under-represented in previous film versions of the legends.<br />Although the interiors are authentic, the location scenes show the full beauty of the English Countryside and the scenes of Arthur riding through look magnificent.<br />A strong supporting cast, including Johnny Gielgud in one of his later, cameo-style roles add an air of quality to the proceedings.
B00001QEE8|5.0|This is absolutely the best animated film I have seen till date. The screenplay is so well written that you feel that its not a film but something which is happening right around you. The emotions...everything about it is just Super.
B00005R2M3|1.0|This is the worst CD Ive ever heard. Ugly songs. Dont waste your money.
B00005BL2A|5.0|It definitely doesn't seem as dark as their recent albums on the first few listens. Songs like &quot;shine&quot; and &quot;when the body speaks&quot; have a positive and soothing effect with only a slight hint of sarcasm. If you listen closely though, these songs realy aren't that positive. I think &quot;I am you&quot; is the most sadistic tune they've ever come out with...in a way that gets less and less subtle with each listen.
B00005UQ9F|1.0|i cannot believe this movie got more than 1 star, i would have given it none, but i couldnt. i read the back of the DVD and thought it sounded great, took it home, watched it, then decided i really wasted my money, not to mention the 2 hours or so that id never get back. i am a massive fan of horror/suspense, but this had neither. it looks like a made for tv movie like on the USA channel, except it couldnt be, too many curse words..........skip it
B00005YXZH|2.0|...I am not one of the torch-bearers wishing... that Wilco would re-release their A.M. under some new cosmic-sonically enhanced 3-D media. I have no problem with them wanting to be nearly as diverse musically as Neil Young when it comes to expressing themselves. The problem is, this album simply inspires little more than a yawn. Not once upon a full attention A-Z listen-through of the CD have I yet to feel inspired to \\"turn it up\\" or \\"hear that one part again.\\" Instead, it becomes more understandable why Reprise did what they did. <br />Musically, nothing on this CD can be considered to be as deep and profound as anything found on Being There, as dark as \\"How to Fight Loneliness,\\" as gripping as \\"Via Chicago\\" or as catchy as \\"ELT\\" et.al. from Summerteeth. Lyrically, I find myself feeling like the infamous Mike Love must have in that interview we've all seen where he rattles off some nonsensical VanDyke Parks lyrics from the Smile era and reminisces about asking, \\"Brian, what exactly do these lyrics mean?\\" For the most part, if there's a theme within a song, or sometimes even within an isolated verse, it's beyond this boy's post-graduated educated mind. I don't mean to look backward when comparing this CD, but if you're going to move forward and break new ground, you have to give us a thread of something to grab a hold onto as the previous CDs did when they were released.<br />The one exception to the above is Reservations, which in itself merits the second star from this review.<br />What is it I'm after? Simply a good album I can relate to, packed full of good songs to paraphrase Brian Wilson when speaking about Rubber Soul -- perhaps too much to ask in this day and age of MP3s, burning CDs and their accompanying disposable music... Cheers!
B00003CX5P|2.0|People sleeping on the streets dressed in cloaks and wearing otherworldy masks. The deep breathing sound of a respirator being mimicked by all. 30 year old teenage geeks running around with sticks that light up and make electric razor sounds. <br />No it's not the Apocalypse; it is the hype related to the screening of Episode 1: The Phantom Menace. Although to many it might as well have been the end of the world since the most anticipated film of all time (undoubtably the most anticipated prequel to a cult classic ever) was the biggest letdown of all time.<br />The film has divided fans into three different groups: Those who were let down by the movie, those who were let down but love Star Wars so much they will never speak badly of it (ie 30 year old teenagers living in their parents' basement) and those who (gasp!) actually enjoyed it (the most deranged members of this group say they prefer this over the original trilogy and/or actually like Jar Jar Binks).<br />This film is filled with major flaws such as the poorly written (and poorly acted) Anakin Skywalker (how in the world can a kid so young build a robot and podracer if he is a slave?). Anakin's accidental destruction of the Trade Federation ship  is pretty much a farce. Perhaps Anakin's line from that scene says it all; \\"Oops!\\"<br />The battle droids were pathetically flawed (geez, if I was building an army I definately would not make them mindless fools) and did not have the grunt stupidity that the good old Stormtroopers have. And if they are so mindless, why waste time having them talk?<br />All this could be forgiven if not for the greatest evil ever unleashed. Now we come to the major villain in all of Star Wars history: Jar Jar Binks. This frog-like Jim Crow minstrel with his awful speech impediment ruined the film. His pathetic clumsiness and shoddy dialogue made him the slapstick of the film; perhaps fill the void left by the present but minor C-3PO and R2-D2. At C-3PO had the whole gay pride thinggoing for him; Jar Jar is just annoying. With all the hatred people have for the frog freak, it is a wonder that Burger King or McDonalds haven't been granted permission to start production of the Jar Jar Burger; made from real Gungan.<br />This will always be remembered as the worst Star Wars film ever (unless Episode 3 is terrible; but I don't think so). I watched the original trilogy over 100 times each over two years. This film will never make that grand total in my lifetime. Ed Wood's B-film classic \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\", Peter Jackson's ultra gore indie \\"Bad Taste\\" and the badly acted \\"Crawling Hand\\" are more entertaining than this film.
0812548094|4.0|Very Good, but not great... good characterisation and descriptions, the prolonged graphic descriptions are there for a purpose, not from a morbid pre-occupation with rape or pain - we see the results of his months of torture with Denna (book#1) causing the deaths of two Sisters - without being pre-armed with his forceful hate of collars, we would think his refusal to wear one a bit pig-headed. <BR>Many things are injected into the plot whose significance is not apparent until much later - I found myself forgetting about Scarlet, until she suddenly appears; probably the egg will have a significance in the next book(s). <br />Altogether a good sustaining read - never boring - makes you want to continue straight on to the next book in the series. <BR>My Wife has just finished 'Temple of the Winds' (book#4) and says it continues to be just as exciting, unlike the 'Wheel of Time' series.
0920668364|5.0|I would highly recommend this book. I think that this book is a great story that reminds you about the people you truly love and care about.  However, as you get older, sometimes you are so busy that the person you love and care for are people you take for granted.  This book reminds you that the people you love will always be there for you.  This also reminds you that the people who care and love you will need you sometime, too.  I would recommend this to a student of mine who is being raised by his aunt.  He still communicates with his mother, but he considers his aunt his mom.  I think he would enjoy this book because he loves his biological mom very much and appreciates and loves his aunt.  This book is comparable to Over the Moon because Over the Moon is about a parent and how much she loves her daughter.
B000060MY6|5.0|David Lynch is not a genius (well, he might be...I haven't a clue what his IQ is), but he is undeniably an artist, and a good one. The trouble is, most American moviegoers do not have a frame of reference in which to place him. He's a committed expressionist, and we prefer-you might even say demand--realism in our dramas (see the critic below who hated the film because the characters don't talk like people do in real life). Expressionism has always been much more prevalent in European films, from the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Nosferatu onward through Fellini and Godard and even Bergman. It doesn't mean Americans are in any way inferior to Europeans; it just means that we have a different conception of strange.<br />That said, I'm still a little baffled by those who say that MD doesn't make sense. I admit that after I saw it the first time, I walked out feeling happily disoriented, but the second time left me a little disappointed--turns out the film was much more streamlined that I'd thought. It's all a fantasy except for the very first scene, in which we see Diane's rumpled bed sheets, until the Cowboy tells Diane to wake up. After that we see, in disjointed chronology, the events in Diane's life that manifested themselves in the fantasy. The haggard, bitter Diane invents the impossibly fresh-faced, impossibly hopeful Betty.  The failed actress invents a Hollywood where mysterious men in suits wield power in absurd, capricious ways. The rejected lover invents a helpless amnesiac who depends on her completely. It's a Jungian smorgasbord, so what better key holder than the Jungian monster behind the diner?<br />Sure, there are surreal touches here and there, and a few rough edges that are no doubt the result of the film's haphazard production history. But for the overwhelming majority of the time, MD barely strays from the rudiments of film noir. It's a grander, giddier Blue Velvet.<br />David Lynch is an artist with his own expressionistic/surrealistic style, andyou just can't judge his work by the standards of realism. So what if people don't talk this way in real life? The film isn't about real life. Of course, if the film just flat out bored you, then so be it. We have different taste. I can only speak for myself, and I was engrossed, enchanted, and thoroughly entertained.
