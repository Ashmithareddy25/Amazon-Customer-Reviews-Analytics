B00J360DOA|5|The part I ordered came in a timely manner and was exactly what I needed
B00EPN2FVU|5|Item arrived within the estimated time. It was very easy to transfer old system board into new unit. Now I can see which button to push.<br />Great buy!
B0024E6W02|5|works as needed
B001J89Q98|1|This product does NOT work ! ! !<br /><br />DO NOT BUY IT ! ! !
B00HYJU6I6|5|Ok
B003TY5ENM|1|My lights aren't working
B00V9AUSNY|5|Looks amazing
B0041I2LJU|3|The listing is incorrect, the adapter is for a DA not a drill,  I can use it, so I will keep it.  Chemical Guys has the &#34;Good Screw&#34; on sale for $3.95 on their website, might throw one of those on my next order, hopefully it will be the correct model.
B000CKBJ44|4|Great product, the price was better than I could have gotten for the same part at a local auto parts store and I had no issues.
B00KY0MPH2|5|Great product and delivery. Ups and the seller is top notch. Installation was about 30 minutes.
B007J7DX6A|5|Great Product! Smells great and would order again!
B003R7BZR0|5|worked fine.  unsure about long term quality, but great so far
B004NPO8LU|5|GREAT PRODUCT AND PRICE
B000T2W336|4|These straps work well with my Yakima rack.  They are very stiff to start, but holding up well.
B000ENOPPO|5|Tire is still up will know in a couple of days so far so good
B00NLPQ5L4|1|Poor quality. The seams started to unravel in just a few months. Now I have pieces of the cheap material all over my car, windshield, and dashboard. Would not recommend. Spend a little more money at Walmart to get one that will last through the hot summer months.
B008B9ELRU|5|Shipping okay. I like it. Looks cool. Doesn't cover up the month sticker for me like the 1 guy said in his review for the silver one like this. I have FL plates. It's probably different for every state.
B00EO1F9I4|2|Coil wire fell apart while taking it out of box.
B00280BL9O|3|head is too shallow for liking.
B00KUL9XSO|5|fits perfectly to my jeep cherokee xj 4x4 1995, i am very satisfied with the product
B000BRFQLK|5|Received on time and exactly as depicted.  Excellent!!!
B00SCGLC1A|5|Great.
B00LIQYX12|5|These are great!  Received as promised.  Installed in a few minutes.  A nice addition to my car.
B001NZQIDE|5|Fit truck with no issues. Worked out as planned
B00KJ8L7B4|5|I have bought two kits, the first is still great. The second had a bad ballast--they sent me a new one free. Thank you innovited
B000PWUX14|5|exact replacement, fit same as factory original right down to the length of the wiring
B000HBNTXW|3|The packaging was horrible.  Soap from this was all over the inside of the box.
B000C59M3O|5|These are the best low priced shocks for a firm ride!!!
B008Z8W5XY|4|i wish it had a larger diameter and footprint - my main cup holder is a little wider. I think I will remedy it with a foam insert I'll fashion at home...
B000EVYGZA|4|MAYBE I DONT KNOW HOW TO USE IT, BUT DOES NOT TELL ME IF BATERY IS GOOD OR BAD
B001OQT0U0|5|Fit great. Super happy. Would recommend to any one.
B00R8GJOS8|3|Cleaned and installed as per the instructions on &#34;daytime running&#34; headlights, they looked great :) and then blew off two days later.:(  on that aspect I guess the sticky wasn't sticky enough or whatever.:(
B00ZVIA41G|5|Exactly what i was looking for.
B00LDR8LB4|4|Makes my car look new
B004EKYB7U|5|Direct replacement for my broken knob - lifesaver for my AC
B00842A7F4|4|These Phgiveu push-type nylon came in very handy, especially when replacing the old product
B00MV1V80C|3|returned it because it was not a good color match
B0130NLX8G|5|Where has this been all my life!! This car garbage can is awesome. Lots of roomy pockets for snacks, papers, soda bottles. Actually, it's good for anything you either want to store or throw away. Good for long drives or day trips. One of the best features in my opinion is it looks good, and it's waterproof!! No more leaking soda bottles, or dripping leftover food. Easily washed too! Great product!
B00NSVFNAA|5|Very awesome decals, and very friendly seller.
B007NJOEAI|5|as advertised
B0000AZ5MC|3|Got water in them and  busted bulbs on first use
B00DV7XV4Q|5|Nice product and quick delivery
B004ROPQ2C|5|I LUV IT....
B00JLKVHNY|5|Surprisingly genuine MB mats.<br />Fits perfectly and looks good.
B00UKCE87E|5|The quality was just as I expected.  I plan on buying a Dr. Ben Carson Sticker soon.
B001LHVOVK|5|Does the same job as the $100 readers but for less than a fifth of the price. I now know what im getting all of the men in my family for christmas.
B00S9XAPA0|3|They did what they said they would do but they feel like they're going to break any day now. Pretty cheap material but to be expected for the price. Reminds me of the cheap toys you get from the quarter machines in the arcades.
B0049Z8X4C|5|Very nice quality and a super gift!
B00B36CH3S|5|Works well.
B0085G9V7E|2|Couldn't  find the plug. I spliced  the wires and it worked fine for about 6 months  then the right side reverse  light quit working. It will flash sometimes  but most of the time it just dont work.
B00NNDRTD2|5|Great product great service
B0002F67ZK|5|Very clean, easy installation.
B004V753SW|5|Had these installed on my HARLEY.  VERY COOL.
B0032J1KAK|1|Worthless repackaged don't stick old stock glue no good
B006GLA8TA|5|perfect fit. Very easy to install. I love them
B009B9KMW2|5|nice
B00ENN04VA|5|Got just what I needed for the passenger on the GoldWing.
B00TXENKTM|5|the colors are so bright! its even cuter in person. Shipping took really long but the shipping was free sooo......
B00BJLQ3JG|5|Good quality
B00AGN68QQ|3|delivery was great<br />papers don't have much flavor...<br />worth it for the container and wood tip though
B003VVJEGQ|5|Perfect
B00E1SM81G|5|Replaced the brakes on my 2006 Civic LX 4-door sedan. Direct fit. I've been driving on them for a year now with no problems. I'm very happy with them, and even though they're dirty now, they still wash up nicely and look great.<br /><br />UPDATE 5/9/2016: I've attached some pictures of the rotors after two years of heavy use. These rotors have gone through roughly 20-30k miles of mixed driving and 6-7 autocross events. Moderate glazing, and you can see that one of the brake pads had a weird grind spot. I have replaced these with standard vented rotors with a black finish for rust protection.
B000W0KTMW|4|It works well but it is difficult to get the key into the lock in the correct position.  They need to make the lock only allow the key to move into two positions.  Open and close.  As it is now the entire top part of the locking mechanism spins 360 degrees.  I do believe it would deter your average thief.  However anyone really wanting to take your bike will just get enough muscle and pick it up.
B005ASSIOC|5|Jones makes Magnaflow copies.  I put this on a 2004 Tahoe with a 5.3.  There is a video on the web showing the Jones outflowing the comparable Magnaflow by 20% (475 v. 563 cfm or so).  The best thing about this muffler is that there is no drone.  Also, it fit without adding any additional pipe.  I like the tone as well.  It is not aggressive.  Did I mention that there is no drone?
B00B7ORHNG|5|The cover fits like a glove. Lowrance should include these when you purchase one of their units.
B001HMV1MQ|5|Installed on 1988 Toyota MR2 front hub. Worked great!
B002T5TH5I|1|Snake oil.  I keep track of mileage in my vehicles and my truck gets 19.xx on highway, and 13-14 around town.  Recently added this to my engine/fuel before taking a long drive (1000 miles round trip), checked mileage along the way, and still getting same mileage.  Same route, same speeds, same time to get to destination, no out of the ordinary traffic, and I didn't get any changes in mileage/performance.  Luckily I cashed in some awards points and didn't actually spend my own money on this.  Not sure why I keep biting on this type of stuff, it looked promising from reading and reviews.  I'm going to stick to changing my oil with full synthetic and premium filters every 3-5k miles and call it a day.
B00867HUMK|5|like described,arrived in time
B000DT7Y70|5|This was the perfect pump for my application. Installs easily, fits neatly on the frame rail as I needed it.
B00DW3KDWW|5|Fantastic.  Cleared a code that could not be done at a garage!
B000CM3I9Q|2|The mirror is fine.  However, don't even think about trying to remove the old glass.  If yours is only cracked and the new one can be placed over it (this is recommended by the manufacturer), do it.  If yours is too broken to stick the new one over it, forget it and buy a whole assembly.  It will be less work and much less to clean up and safer than dealing with 1 million shards of glass.  Double sided tape is included.
B00BJW9ZZ4|5|fit the back of our 2005 trailblaizer perfectly
B000KZ0Q7W|5|Ordered for my 2000 Siverado.  Worked great, easy to program.
B00JMLBIF4|5|Good quality, came in on time easy to put on rims and looks great. I'm glad I found your product.<br />Thank you.
B00H36XX6C|5|To be quite frank, these are awesome. I have a [[ASIN:B00H36XXIA NOCO XGrid XGB3 11Wh Rugged USB Battery Pack]] and a [[ASIN:B00H36XXE4 NOCO XGrid XGS9USB 9W Portable Solar Panel and USB/LED Flashlight Kit]] and they are absolute essentials if you're going to be gone for more than a day out in the woods. Most of the time though, I charge a couple of these up and take them as backups for my phone. They're rugged, element proof, and extremely reliable and shock proof. I use them for work too just in case.<br /><br />The XGB3 is slightly smaller than the SGB3L. I'll try to post some pictures so you can see the difference in size between the two products.  The batteries and outlet ports are all the same. The difference is that the XGB3L has a 250 lumen LED flashlight and if you're a camper, you can never have enough reliable flashlights. The flashlight has high, medium, low, blinking and off as its modes.<br /><br />The product is extremely ruggedized with a rubber coating, rubber seals for the ports. It has a microUSB so that you can charge it with either a solar panel or charger (it comes with a micro usb cord) and it has a standard USB port so that you can plug in your phone.<br /><br />CONVERSION OF WATT HOURS TO MILLIAMPERE HOURS<br />This question comes up all the time the unit is listed as 11Mh and it is stamped at 3000mAh @ 3.7v.  The input and output are at 5V so the formula is as follows:<br /><br />mAh = Wh × 1000 / V<br /><br />So, this is an 11 Wh unit and the power ports usually puts out about 5V so you get:<br /><br />2,200 mAh = 11 X 1000 / 5<br /><br />It's roughly a 2,200 mAh battery. It has one USB charging port so you can charge one device at a time.<br /><br />If you have the option of getting the one with the flashlight, I would, particularly if you're going to be out in the woods. Always nice to have a rugged spare flashlight.<br /><br />Overall, if you're going to be out in the countryside for more than a day and it's sunny, definitely take one of the solar panels and you can charge one of these battery packs during the day and use it to charge your power hungry devices overnight. I have a small Bluetooth speaker that I use for campsite music and these charge it great overnight.charge your power hungry devices overnight.

B0011DKBWW|5|good
B004NKZOOK|1|This product failed 3 mos. after purchase. Do yourself a favor and buy genuine VW parts
B00PAMUA1M|5|Matches my truck perfectly!!
B00BYGMBXS|4|Look good - Easy install. Not as noticeable as I thought they would be.
B00HWCXFRY|1|The product itself is fine. It works as a shock should and nothing but perfect from Arnott. The seller however not so reliant. My order showed two were shocks were included in the kit when purchased. When I contacted them concerning it, they replied with it being Amazon's fault not theres but they would let amazon know, so rather than make it right, they put blame on someone else and left it as is. Again great product , poor seller . I'll be buying again just from another seller.
B003L358WI|5|Thanks
B000A0EJ9S|5|Easy replacement in our 2002 Honda CRV.
B001GN2C4C|5|Install went fairly smooth. would recommend to anyone mechanically inclined. Original lights still work fine.
B002AV3NLA|5|Satisfied with purchase, shipment speed, and product.
B00OU5LOT2|4|I recivied this product yesterday and am very happy with it. The reason for the four star rating is that one strip does not light up red and the music detection could be better, but overall this is a great and easy to use system.
B0093AA1CK|5|Fits perfectly and keeps the heat out.
B00IBG2C9W|5|Work great and very bright.
B00AUBU2KC|2|Not bright enough.
B003UIDQ0K|5|Awesome product, Flitz is the Shitz...
B00HTOB0NG|5|Easy installation does what is made for works perfectly
B006JXVVMS|4|Nice quality and easy to install.  Secured well with the included 3M tape. Fit was spot on. While I do like the finished look, I can't honestly say it made a difference in the sound.  Hopefully it will help hold head this winter.
B007SNIEVY|4|It was smaller bottle than I expected, but smells good.
B005N00DL8|5|Received my order today and it's a prefect tribute to law enforcement, not to mention that it is a nice bumper magnet.
B00NK9ZAL2|5|Fits well...although i could of made my own!!!
B002P8T2PO|5|worked well and was reasonable
B003HIC7MQ|4|This product is a good value for the money.  However, installing it into a Ford Edge is perhaps a greater challenge than any of the other vehicles described in the advertisements.  I did get this installed and it does perform like I hoped it would but this was much more than the standard DIY effort you would expect.  In this vehicle removing the &#34;Jounce&#34; bumpers requires fully compressing and removing the rear springs, not an easy job.  Based on the type of vehicle you drive, this may turn out to be daunting.
B0023VH21Y|5|Nice part
B0057X1FD6|5|A bit more hefty than I thought, these things are great
B0009H51XU|5|Fit perfectly fine with no problems!!! 🌟
B001Y8NF90|5|Nice product.  Saves your awning from wind damage!
B00DMTTT8A|5|Fit perfectly and keep the sand and muck out of the carpet.  Just dump out and spray down with water.
B000PGEMQM|2|Good product!
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Received in 4 days(AMAZING) lights work great and are super bright...great purchase
B002X6VXL4|5|Very nice

B003YHZV2S|5|good,product,fast service
B00SSOTONE|5|Great decal.ship early.very good
B004GCNKAU|4|These bars look awesome, installed quickly & easily.  Bars are much thicker than factory bars. Highly recommend..!!!
B006P8A5P6|5|Sewed this onto a snapback--will be great for parties!
B00I2JH7U2|5|the right product fits exactly
B00WBFKI6S|5|Look great, nice little addition to the box car! And they look like the punisher skulls!
B00S9YI84Y|5|Easy to install and works great!!!!
B00KCXU67C|5|Looks good
B005FNKSMW|5|All good
B00EPA7CZC|4|Good color temperature, not that much brighter than some of the OEM dome bulbs but great for license plate and some interior light applications. If you can fit the bigger T10 with more LED's do it, elsewhere when space is tight use these.  No duds in the package so far so ordered more and replaced in multiple Nissan/Infiniti vehicles, even works with dimmers even though they don't specify that.
B0007M1ZGE|5|Great
B005BOQ8NS|5|this includes the electronics switches Etc.. I just needed the plastic housing
B007PMY3MM|2|Doesn't last too long..
B007KPFDKA|5|Very well packaged, fast shipping. Nice product. Thank you.
B00QVQ2UAK|5|What can I say about it? It's a standard taillight for a trailer. Standard configuration, fits perfectly and isn't a piece of crap like the stock one that Haulin used on my trailer. Once I replaced it and powered up the trailer, it lit and signaled correctly. Can't ask for much more than that! (and it didn't cost me $20+ like it would at an auto store, either).
B0036E9VB6|4|Works great but every time I used it in the cigarette lighter recepticle it blew a fuse. Instead of putting in a more heavy-duty fuse (and possibly damage something electrical) I got an adapter on Amazon that connects directly to the battery terminal. Problem solved.
B0039234WM|5|Easy drop in replacement wiper blades for our 2010 Audi A4 Avant.  Wish the rear wiper was easy to find a replacement for!
B00Z7KIZPA|4|The purse pouch seemed flimsy and il shapen - not at all like it appeared in the pictures. It's still useful just not as nice looking.
B008BVNNBI|1|Shipped and arrived quickly.  Product is sooooo cheaply designed and made. I sat down one time on it and it tore.  Poor design that combines cheap material and fake leather.  So sad, but I threw it in the trash.  I never bash a product, but this one deserves bashing. Sorry....
B00KN0UOEE|5|The best vinyl protectant there is, nice satin sheen not the greasy dirt magnet junk like Amoral leaves.
B00I3F38OY|5|Does exactly what it's supposed to do
B00WDSVEE8|5|The lens fit perfectly over both pairs of my glasses. They are dark but if I need to see something on the dash more clearly, I just flip them up for a second.
B00KY4O2BK|1|Broke after just a couple weeks. you get what you pay for
B000BUU5YU|5|Well made and so far so good.Heavy Constructed material and the Power grab handle keeps from Pulling all you haev to do is wiggle it out,saves wear and tear on, &#34;The male Power head Prongs.
B000C2DRME|5|Item arrived as described, well packaged and appears to be of high quality.
B009OH9AOW|5|Fit was was great. Just be careful when puting the new seals on the head bolts the fit is super thight and a few ended up ripping on me no big deal just put some RTV around the seal. No leaks
B007HRGTJA|4|Excellent Replacement Good Price and fit
B00GSAUHB8|5|I'm honestly a little surprised at how well this product works.  I read all the 5 star reviews and have been meaning to replace my current visor (which makes the terrible crinkle sounds when you touch it).  I'm really glad I ended up buying this one.  A few reasons:  1)  Sturdy.  It has a lot of spring in it and it keeps its shape in the window.  2)  It keeps the heat out. Noticeably.  3)  Easy storage.  Once you master the twist/push thing you do to fold it up, it folds in seconds and there is a band that keeps it closed.  Very happy with the purchase and the speed in which we got it.
B004BU5WHG|5|Excellent for my older Lab (11 yrs). Good for putting snowshoes on too!
B000WGLYNE|4|Works
B00K56PR9S|4|I love this product, however it seems to fall sometimes, like it's too short for my windshield. I have a Honda Accord so I figured it would fit since it's a car but maybe I should have gotten the one for an SUV. It may have been a little bigger. Other than that it's a really good product...
B000CF6I6I|5|Easy to install. Works great.
B0015S80QC|5|Exact fit brake pads and worked great on Ford Taurus, good quality product and easy to install
B00T2FVZQ2|4|Look slick, but doesn't change the fact that it's cheap plastic.  You pay for what you get.  The back handle has one are not covered that allows the handle to lift properly, but it's no big deal. Hopefully won't chip easily.
B000W0RQ8C|5|great lock
B00BP5QO7M|4|Nice helmet.......fits well and looks good with Biltwell bubble shield!
B002XM5G70|5|Work fine
B00NJRGD70|5|This is great! I wish I'd bought it at the beginning of the summer. It's extremely lightweight, folds up quite small, and is very big. A large fits perfectly in my Land Rover LR2. Folding it back into its storage bag is a little tricky, but after a few times I got it down.
B000M5Y72A|4|Purchased these lightbulbs to replace the standard ones in my 2005 Nissan Frontier.  They definitely seem to light up the road more and shine down road a bit farther.  I just installed them, so no feedback on longevity yet.  But they were easy to install on that vehicle, so even if they don't last, it's worth it to see better when driving at night.
B00KLSZ632|5|Unique lighting application. Does require minor wiring of a load resistor but not that complex. Just wire one side of the load resistor to the (hot) blinker wire and the other end to the ground wire. The light runs white and swaps to Amber when your blinker is applied then back to white when your blinker is turned off.
B000E471W2|5|Perfect fit for the passenger side of my 2 door coupe.  I'm now looking for a side mirror for the drivers side.
B00ZKUTDZ8|5|Loved it!
B00MP6FS0Y|5|Necessary item for OSHA regulations.  You can clearly see pictogram.  I'm happy to have found them on Amazon.
B006QH54VQ|5|A
B007CX6DKE|5|installed perfectly
B0009OR94M|5|Great product but did not work for my job.
B0002UNON8|4|Well, it obviously won't work miracles. My car's pretty scuffed up, but I used this on some of the scratches and it definitely . . . makes a dent :D
B00CMR79H6|5|fits my Wrangler just like I expected
B009PICMCC|5|This fan works great, pulls a ton of air, very simple to install. supplied brackets worked perfect on my 2005 Hummer H2..<br /><br />The ONLY beef i have is the wires from each fan, are a bit short...that's it..<br /><br />After all, this is designed as a universal design, so you will have to do wiring as needed..<br /><br />This is a great dual fan setup...
B000B8LKZK|3|This cap fits super tight... its a pain to take off but I guess it seals well... haha
B000CQVOC0|5|good fit good price
B008N8ILQG|5|no issues
B010XZRQCG|5|[[VIDEOID:fa9d7576bb78882d72415cd5ff31fd7a]] They are brighter than incandescent lamps, and they are brighter than SuperBright T10 LEDs. And they do not have a polarity orientation (meaning when you plug these in, they work - some LED lamps have to be flipped around if they don't light).<br /><br />Changing the incandescent lamps inside your car is a nice little easy upgrade. Why would you do that? Intensity of the light, color temperature, and you'll never have to change the lamp again. These error free lamps do not use less electricity than standard incandescent bulbs (there is a resistor inside the lamp to create the same load as an incandescent lamp, fooling the computer into thinking the lamp is fine).<br /><br />I've done a few LED upgrades on my cars. SuperBright is the accepted standard place most people buy lamps. They have a huge selection and make really great lamps. I already swapped out the incandescent T10 lights in my car and replaced them with SuperBright LEDs. This was a second or third time I've swapped out those lamps to test a different LED. The other brands I've tested are all very similar to SuperBright - about the same amount of light, slightly better design, and a lot cheaper. Alla comes up with a lamp that is about the same price as SuperBright but have a lot more LED segments on the fixture. Well that pays off - these stinkers are super bright (pun totally intended). The light is more like an incandescent lamp - round and even.<br /><br />I'm not sure I totally agree with the 6000K color temperature. In fact the pair I got are way warmer than that - more like 4000K. For me, I like that way better inside a car. I like warmer glow over that cold harsh daylight color.<br /><br />I love that these lamps have no polarity. They work plugged in either direction, just like an incandescent lamp. They fit perfectly in a T10 socket. They are a little larger than an incandescent lamp, but should fit in whatever fixture you have.<br /><br />They're really great lamps.<br /><br />A free sample was provided for review.ided for review.
B009R6ZTBS|5|Good quality
B00TJD0ZW2|5|The unit was delivered very quickly - before the estimated date.  Install went smoothly and it's been working great.
B004I17I48|5|This was perfect for my van. The dealership quoted me $300+ to install. This took 20 minutes of my time and looks great!
B000NPUJQC|3|These socket rails were flimsy and don't hold sockets all that well. They would be good if you had them sitting on a flat surface but do not hold up well to a whole lot of jarring or movement of any kind.
B0016LA5O8|1|WARNING, this product may not be used with current BMW vehicles and is not returnable.  Read your car's manual before ordering.  I wish I had.  I ordered two of these and only learned when I was preparing to use them that they could damage my vehicles.  Then I learned Amazon considers them unreturnable!
B00042KG3A|1|Powder coat/ or so it said was chipping off during shipping. Wasn't even the same hi-jack as in picture. Had different parts on it. Not happy
B0006IX7W4|5|Nice product.  Makes it very easy to hang things from your awning.
B001JT7DDI|1|Purchased two, thanks to a very poor quality set screw in each, the adjustable tip is now missing on both. Now you cannot set the swr.<br /> Would NEVER purchase this antenna again.<br /> Brian. G.
B00D3298A0|5|These are heavy duty - fit well and keeps my vehicle very clean!
B00LMOJ0KO|4|Fits well. A tad on the slippery side; would have preferred a non-stick surface. Ease to clean. Fairly good lip thou don't go thinking this thing is going to stop spills from going over the edge.
B00JWVTYBO|5|As described.  On time delivery  very happy! Thanks
B00N2JXGWU|5|Bought this with a gasket kit and an BD intake horn. Boost went up. Very happy.
B00OYX74LC|4|I love the look of these numbers...would have rated them 5-stars, but a couple of the letters (&#34;A&#34; and &#34;B&#34;) were bubbled/creased. Otherwise, they would be perfect.
B00JJ6DN1O|5|Easy to write on, nice and noticeable outside and easy to peel and stick. After 2 weeks they have not peeled. Good buy to save your fur babies!!
B003ZA8WIE|5|Exactly as depicted
B006166QDM|5|Nice quality
B00A6AS6LY|5|This should be right along side the 3/8&#34; ratchet set in any mechanics tool box. If you ever crack open the cooling system in a car, you should bleed the coolant. This makes it a breeze.
B00FMV0WFA|4|It's nice, not sure it's $35 nice, but it's nice.
B001KO9IEE|4|Looks awesome, installed easily. Brings handlebars back and is much more comfortable when riding. Rerouting of stock cables is necessary or +2 in&#34; replacement necessary.

B00FYK0DHQ|5|Real nice everytime i open my door i get a compliment
B00QVQ4HMO|5|I like the base the bulb sits in because it is similar to an automotive base. My old one on my SureTrac trailer had 2 strips and was junk. This one wired right up in 2 minutes and there is even a bulb included so I was good to go. I recommend.
B005QURVB0|5|Quick and easy way to secure wheels and such on bike rack
B0002TDUXS|2|If you are using this product for your truck bed, I would recommend applying at least 5 coats. I first used this product last year on my 98 Silverado. I scuffed the bed, added two coats of paint primer, sanding between coats, and then applied two coats of herculiner. Within one year, the primer coat was showing through and the herculiner seemed to be deteriorating. I live in north Florida with extremely high humidity and heat, so maybe that had something to do with it. But I will be applying at least 4 more coats and give it one more shot.
B004P0B6IQ|3|Wasn't the best
B003TQ07K0|5|First, it is very hard to find a Syn oil in 10w30 viscosity. RedLine is one of the very few that makes the oil in that viscosity. Therefore, it is a must, if you want to run a great oil in your modern Honda, etc<br />Second, it is very good motor oil and works very good where the viscosity is prescribed. My Honda's engine loves it. Transmission seems to shift better than on the original Honda oil as well. I wish it could be cheaper without cutting the quality.<br />The only negative is the fact that the bottle has no view/measuring line and you have to look inside to figure out the quantity of oil left. Not a big deal but annoying.
B000C9FLA8|2|These where proper length.. But I think one of them are bad. Having issue starting since I changed them. Feel like I should have just kept the old ones on.. The truck was running better with them...
B004DK4P5O|3|Works well. The drivers side window switch broke and will now only work with 10% of the time.
B00080QHMM|5|Easy to use and read. Great value.
B000BGM4PM|5|just what I' needed. Previous one was damaged on last trip so I thought to find a new one. Looked at camping stores-no luck. Should have gone to Amazon first. I keep learning that lesson but continue to search in many places.
B000IYQGPG|5|So far so good.  Mounted up and matched the old OEM part exactly. So installing it was a breeze.  The quality of the part seemed to be built very well, although time will tell as its only been installed a week.  So no real extensive information is available for me to share.  But if  I needed another part like this I would not hesitate to purchase it again.
B00ATWLY0E|5|I received this item on the 22nd and it is now the 24th. I immediately installed it in my 2015 Chevy Cruze and it fit like a glove! I'm in love with this cover. It is more of a purple-grey, but that's fine, it's still adorable. Super soft and easy to use. I'm in love so far!
B006YCKH5Q|2|These turned out to be the wrong size and I can not return them because there was no packing slip in the box or return address on the box.
B0008G1NB6|2|It was missing two brackets. Which makes it useless
B00NFFE7PG|5|To me the best fully (100%) synthetic oil in America to be used in any kind of cars, European, American, Asian and Japanese, etc. Remember it has been the oil for 40 years for the famous  french Citroen and the oil used  by the winner of the Paris-Dakkar Rally. If you use it with a high quality filter that lasts for as long as 10.000 miles like the micro-Green brand (found in Amazon) the oil will last one year or 10.000 miles whichever comes first giving full engine protection. This is a French oil formula packed in America for USA and Canada markets. It can be used on gasoline and diesel engines. Its API rating is SM/CF and it ACEA rating is A3/B4. Certified by Mercedes Benz with code 229.5, by BMW with code long life 01, by Audi and VW with codes 502.00/505.00 and by Porsche with code A40. Hope Amazon mantains the same price in the future. I honestly invite you to try it, your engine will feel the difference.
B00KVVBEWQ|4|I put this unit through a crash course as I received it the day before we left on a ten day road trip. So we had to set it up and use it on the run which I figured would be an excellent test of how easy it is to use.<br /><br />While this is marketed as an RV device the only reason is based on the built in content and the routing algorithms in the software. I set the unit to car mode and minimized the RV related settings since we were traveling by car.  But the RV related content is still always available should you want or need it.  While it’s focused on RVers, the information and vehicle settings would be beneficial for any vehicle towing a trailer as it lets you enter specific vehicle dimensions to accommodate the size.<br /><br />In the box are a HUGE 12 volt car charger, an AC power block and long micro USB cable to power the unit when out of the vehicle and a mounting arm with a suction cup base. The accessories are all high quality but lack the style and functionality I expected from this top of the line device.<br />The impression right out of the box is that this is a quality piece of hardware that is well thought out and well made.  Some of that holds up but other areas don’t as Ill share below.<br /><br />Initial setup of the software is straightforward and intuitive.  You can set up virtually all of the basic functions and options without referring to the manual.  However, as you get deeper into using the device you will need to reference the manual to understand and customize functionality and settings.<br /><br />In terms of mounting the unit, the included arm is sturdy and well-made but has limitations.  The arm does not rotate at the base so depending on where you are mounting it you may have to get creative in its placement.  The arm does rotate at the device end but its range of motion is limited left to right because of the mounting bracket and charging base.  The suction cup base is very strong and its outer edge has some sort of very sticky surface that allows it to cling and maintain suction even on curved and semi-textured surfaces.  I mounted this to a dash where about a third of the diameter of the suction cup had a fairly significant curve.  It took several attempts to get just the right angle because again the base is in a fixed position to the arm. The cup stuck for several hours and then fell off.  I thought it may be too much curve to grab.  But when I inspected the cup I noticed a good amount of dust had collected on the sticky surface.  So a quick cleaning with some water and it stuck like glue for the rest of our trip.  As for the down side of the arm.  The weight of the unit combined with the relatively long arm means there can be a lot of bounce when going down the road.  I tried to minimize the amount of leverage as much as possible but the only way I could eliminate the bounce was to rest some portion of the arm or unit against the dash. An adjustable base and a bit more strength would be a huge improvement.<br /><br />The seven inch HD display is plenty sharp for displaying maps and other small images in any light. I noticed that in some light I had problems seeing the screen with my polarized sunglasses. Not an issue most of the time but I did have trouble sometimes and only with polarized lenses. The touch sensitivity is on par with any tablet I’ve used.<br /><br />The software that runs the GPS is based on Android, but don’t expect tablet like responsiveness. Despite its looks and software there is quite a bit of lag compared to a tablet. In some cases going from a sub menu back to the live map took several seconds and dimmed the screen to the point that I thought the unit had turned off.  You have to recalibrate your touches to slow them down otherwise you find yourself on screens you never wanted and then having to suffer the maddening time to get back to the map.  Also, certain functions from the main menu are not as intuitive as they would seem and take some getting used to.For example searching for an address takes a click or two more than it should to find the address and set it as the destination. This is especially hard if you are attempting to do it as you are driving.<br /><br />The on-board battery is very small and only provides about fifteen minutes of run time when not connected to a power source. So plan on having a micro USB cable and a charger capable of delivering 2 amps (like an iPad). One is included in the box but be aware of that if you are looking for a backup.<br /><br />Map routing was excellent and as I tested it in areas where I know the streets very well it always seems to choose the route I would choose.  That gives me a lot more confidence when using it on unfamiliar roads. It helped us find two locations that were well hidden off the main road on a side street. And had no problems helping us find our downtown Atlanta exit.<br /><br />It has Bluetooth functionality so you can use it as a hands free speaker.  However, everyone I spoke to when using it asked me if I was on a speakerphone so that’s probably not a good sign. It also connects to Wi-Fi and easily connected to my Jetpack and had integrated data the entire trip.  WiFi is required to update a lot of the content. There is also a Micro SD card slot to upload your own maps and data for creating your own routes.<br /><br />Several integrated real time data feeds including weather, traffic, fuel prices and red light cameras are included. The weather functionality is very disappointing as it does not overlay the navigation map.  You have to go to a separate screen to see the temperature and precipitation.  The red light camera warnings are handy but not up to date. There are several red light cameras that were banned in our city over a year ago but are still popping up here. There is a premium service that is supposed to give you real time speed trap warnings but frankly I wouldn’t spend a dime on it considering I can use Waze and get better info for free. It would be nice to see a Waze integration since it has live data capability. Traffic info was also spotty as it warned of non-existent traffic delays several times.  Fuel info was excellent. Just be aware that a data connection is required for most of this info to be provided.<br /><br />After using it for nearly a month now and about a third of that traveling on vacation I can say it’s really great to have a dedicated GPS unit when traveling in unfamiliar territory. I’d prefer to see a lot less of the info add-ons that are nearly worthless in exchange for more accurate information overlaid on the nav map; especially weather radar.<br /><br />If you are looking for a dedicated GPS unit that is focused on providing directions and content with the RVer in mind this is a good option despite the noted shortcomings. It’s price competitive with anything in its class and delivers on its core mission of getting you from point to point as smoothly as possible.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Quality build, look and feel<br />Excellent directions and routing<br />Great map and directional features<br />Works just as well in a car<br /><br />Cons:<br />Laggy response<br />Flexi mounting arm<br />Useless information and featuresmple searching for an address takes a click or two more than it should to find the address and set it as the destination.

B008JORKP2|5|Awsome
B00877SL2M|5|Works great thanks
B000WJ9J6U|5|aaa
B002N1J5IM|1|Installation was a breeze (hahaha), but the instructions included in the box are completely illegible.  It's like the manufacturer photocopied a copy of a copy of a copy while shaking the copier to make sure the image is extra blurry.  Fortunately, instructions are also printed on the box, but they don't include diagrams like the instruction sheet...or at least, I think they were diagrams, if I squint just right and turn my head sideways.  If you have just a bit of mechanical/electrical ability, installation won't be difficult, and probably no more than about 30 minutes.<br /><br />After installation, though, is where the star rating started to drop.  First, it was pretty clear that the fan motor was snagging on something.  Just spinning by hand, one part of a rotation was snagging up and could actually stop the fan.  I pulled the fan back out of the ceiling to find out what the issue was, and found it was something inside the sealed motor.  Nothing I could do.  So back up it went to see how loud it would be.  The snag issue definitely made a noise...chit.chit.chit.chit.chit...every single rotation. I left it up there, I was leaving the next morning for a trip and needed a fan.<br /><br />Then I installed the screen fan cover..ZZZiiiiiizzzzzzzzzz...the sound of fan blades rubbing on the screen cover. Now I'm taking the fan blades off to see if they're installed correctly.  Unfortunately, no solution.  Still making the noise. Next thing I try, is isolating which side of the screen cover is making noise (the rear). With that determined, I didn't attach the rear of the cover. So the fan is still making the noise while dragging inside the motor, but I've solved the blades on screen noise.<br /><br />After running for about 24 hours, though, the dragging noise stops. It's actually running fairly quiet! Fairly, but still makes enough noise that I can hear it 2 rooms (separated by doors and 20') away. Not too bad for ~$55; I knew it wasn't a Fan-Tastic Fan. The Hengs really moves the air! The air coming in from under the bathroom door feels like I have the AC running.  And then...7 days later, it died completely. Nothing. Nada. Dead.y moves the air!

B000NU6RG8|5|as advertised
B000GTUM9O|2|Not a good fit. I would like to trade it for one that mounts to the fork.
B00MUMNBH0|5|Great product great service
B008ENFT6K|1|Don't waste your money...they fly off the car because the glue does not hold them on. What a waste! Stay away!
B012SOU5ZK|3|These are great so far, they give a good stance look and are great if your rubbing and need space. They fit well but do move.. but once you bolt them down they are secure.
B004ULDIYK|5|They changed the whole look of my van!!
B001UG8S8O|4|Much larger than I expected. I took a picture of it next to a standard sized lighter and a AA battery for scale
B0027A76SU|5|I went through 3 brand name $40+ belts from the local parts store. After a couple hundred miles they would start chirping and eventually sounded like a flock of birds were being tortured!  Turns out the Chrysler spec is for 96.5 inches but everyone only stocks 95.8 inches.  Even the Chrysler Dodge dealer only stocked the longer one.  They figure there's enough variation that it should work.  This belt fit perfect and no squeals after several thousand miles.  This belt is well made and made in USA - unlike some of the others!
B0024NM29I|4|fits fine
B000COTIRK|5|Buy 2. Sell the 4 that came off. Broke even. In my book that's a good deal. Can't beat magnaflow
B0087WBE3U|4|Provide good stopping power in my van and don't seem to have worn grooves into the rotors. They did start to fade after a trip down a mountain pass, but I think that was as much the rotors and calipers as anything.<br /><br />The one thing about these is that they produce an insane amount of dust. After a trip across country and back my front wheels were absolutely covered in brake dust and not all of it washed off. I'm going to have to power wash them to remove all of it.
B00LO20AIK|5|Works like a charm
B00CF2CIGU|5|These are really good. Bright yellow!
B000HBM8HU|5|Fixed a grounding problem on my Toyota Sienna horn.  After cleaning and replacing the dried out electrically conductor lubricant on the steering wheel bearings/ground with this product, my intermittent horn problems were solved.  Good bearing grease for other application as well.
B0048J1H9W|5|Easy install.  Factory match.  Works perfectly.
B000KOVS5M|5|The winch came as advertised but didn't have mounting bolts

B00EA0ZB7I|5|Looks good. Works good.  Been over a month and I don't even have moisture in mine yet....guess I'm the lucky one.  Would definitely purchase again.   Update. 6 months since purchase, all leds still work. No water in mine, installed on daily driven truck that is not garage kept.
B00YHU8VUU|4|The tire cover was good quality.  But the grill emblem was very low quality and  broke the first  week it was on my wife's jeep.

B000P4Q6MC|3|Not as powerful as OEM. I replaced the rear window washer pump on a BMW X5, the pump barely dr the water out on the glass.
B00K889FCI|4|Will use again.  Be sure to follow directions
B000C2UDXK|5|Worked fine for our 1995 Ford Ranger pickup. We had a locking gas cap and 1 key to it, so switched to this one. No problems.
B0089LT0D0|5|received fast, great product
B000BM8RT8|4|Lots of my off-road buddies use this and I know why. It's a capable performer that won't break the bank. It can handle airing up chores after a trail ride without overheating and is easily stowed in my trail kit for easy access. I've had this about six months and am satisfied with quality and value for this compressor.
B00GJKA7WQ|4|This came in original honda replacement parts packaging, although the color was a flat white instead of my cars pearl white color it is still unnoticeable to the naked eye. Installation was some and the product is very durable. Would buy again if needed

B00D1418KI|5|The Hausbell 12 volt tire pump works great, I have purchase several 12 volt pumps over the years and this pump ranks right up there with the best pumps I have owned. They are really small and If you have a big truck tire like I have to fill up takes some time to do. Not taking anything away from this pump at all. My 110 volt air compressor takes about 3 minutes to air my big truck tire up. I have a 1 ton truck and my tires require 70 to 80 lbs of air pressure in each tire. A lot of the gas stations we have around here won't even get my tire to 70 lbs.Caution these air compressors will over heat in high temps after they run for 3 or 4 minutes. You should shut it off for a while and allow it to cool down. Every pump I have had does the same thing ! Due to their size, the air pump has to work so hard to build air pressure that it does get very hot and in some case will even blow your fuse on your cigarette lighter or aux. outlet. Again let me state it is not just this air compressor it is with all brands of the small 12 volt compressors. For cars and regular trucks this will air your tires back up to 40 lbs with no problem. But with a bigger tire that requires a lot more air pressure you will need to take more time to get your tire up to pressure, due to the fact that they will get hot. In that case you just have to take your time and when it gets hot shut it off and allow it to cool off for a short amount of time. They are really made to be used in emergency situations where you have no other means of airing up your tire. I live on a farm a I am constantly having flat tires. This pump works great for that kind of situation. All in all I would say this is a good air compressor and would recommend it to any one looking for a emergency air compressor. I  am a Amazon reviewer and received this at a discounted price for my honest review. I am just like you and depend on other peoples input and reviews to decide if I am going to purchase an item. With that said, I would buyanother Hausbell 12 volt air compressor it works great for cars, and regular trucks, bikes, mowers ect. But don't think you are going to fill up a tractor tire with ANY small 12 volt pump when you need 100 pounds of air  pressure in a short amount of time. Because they will get hot and you will need to shut them down and allow them to cool off. I am not saying that it can't fill a tire to 100 to 150 lbs. of air, but your not going to just turn the pump on and walk off and expect it to fill a tire without over heating and blowing a fuse or burning up the compressor. Special thanks to Hausbell for allowing me to review their air compressor ! I think it is a great pump at a great price. Hope I have answered any concerns you may have had about this or any other small 12 volt compressor. Thanks.
B0083TYH3G|5|I must say the quality was much better than I expected for the price, and very well made.  I watched the video instructions, although putting these seat covers on was extremely easy.  They have held up so well even with my dog sitting in the passenger seat and climbing all over them.  Also very easy to clean.  I would recommend anyone looking for great looking leather seat covers that won't break your checking account to order these.<br />Also, I  placed these over the custom-fit covers I purchased when I purchased my automobile.... Wish I had seen these first.
B00QSNZ4UY|5|Great buy! I need to buy more.
B00FY81KPC|5|Gracias
B00MRQV0RC|5|Just as described, great deal!
B000NOO798|5|I bought this product summer of 2014 when my 2004 Toyota Matrix XR (1zzge) engine developed a head gasket problem (burning coolant [exhaust moisture + sweet smell], but no coolant in oil or oil in coolant). I had a few minor overheats due to a cracked radiator. but this engine has a weak head prone to warpage. I had recently had this engine rebuilt and could not afford to do it again. I was getting by for a month by refilling the radiator every 10 to 20 miles, it was a slow head gasket leak.  I didn't think this would work but it did. I have put 20k miles on the car and its holding strong, I have even used the Matrix last week to Tow a 2,400 LB BMW with no issues.<br /><br />So here's how I used it; I took out the thermostat, but left the rubber gasket and reinstalled the housing (it is a pain in the butt on my car, but it worked). I emptied all the coolant and flushed it with water. I read online the red devil can react with coolant so we have to clean out the system.<br />I bought peak cooling system flush and mixed it with straight water per the instructions and bleed the cooling system, Do yourself a favor and get the &#34;Lisle 24680 Spill-Free Funnel&#34;, I was broke and spent part of that weeks food money on it, but so worth it! It really is spill free, and spills are the last thing you want when the blue devil is about $50 a bottle.<br />After getting the air bubbles out I took it on the highway for 10 min to let the engine heat up and let the cleaner do its thing.<br />I then flushed it with water about 3 times to get all of that cleaner out of the system, I was shocked at how dirty the water that came out was, These cooling systems need flushing.<br />Next I drained the system and put the plug in, I added some distilled water (1/4 gallon) then I used about half of the blue devil. I continued filling the system till it wouldn't take any more.<br />From there I started the car I topped the system up as needed. Once I had enough water in the car (i checked the capacity of my system online), I put the radiator cap back on to build pressure and reach operating temperature.<br /> I ran the car for an hour or hour and  a half, what ever the blue devil instructions said. I noticed the exhaust vapor had stopped, I needed to get to work that afternoon so I gave myself extra time and baby-ied it all the way there. I took it real easy the first month, still carrying about 6 galons of water at any given time. Two months later I nearly had a breakdown when I lent it to a friend while I was over seas and he said it refused to start the day before I got back. It was just the starter : ) . I know its difficult to believe a sealer can repair a leaking head gasket, but It worked for me, If I can get 4 more years out of this car I'll be happy, It it starts leaking again ill just use red devil again.<br /><br />On a side note red devil is not made for all cases, that BMW I was towing had blown a gasket too, I was tempted to use the product! But I knew that the leak on the BMW was much worse with pooling coolant in some cylinders. For a larger leak like that I would not want to rely on a sealer for another family member's daily driver, yes it could have worked, but BMW's are a little more delicate (temperamental), and I don't mind doing a head gasket on the BMW since that car has less than 100k and will retain its value better than our beat up matrix.
B000GZLHRE|4|Fast delivery and simple install for even us with very little ability to put things together or fix things. I had a little problem putting in one of the bolts on the bottom but I got it. The instructions had little to no detail and could of used a at least a drawing or to. I got it together in the end and now waiting on some pegs, if I knew they were coming from china I would of not ordered them

B00CXTMKIQ|1|Pure junk. Screw that holds bracket to light stripped out the hole althoughthe light never was secured to the bracket (light wobbled on bracket). On the other one the screw would not fit into the hole, so I could not mount the bracket to the light.
B00MEFH3JA|5|Perfect!
B00G2TV7OG|2|They are bright, BUT the base is too loose in the socket. Bumps and vibration cause poor electrical contact. This causes them to FAIL to light when backing up !

B004EQCAMM|5|Fit perfect. Completed the repair.
B001P1XF1E|5|excelent
B000ALG0WG|5|Great product
B004D4URV6|5|This is the best Red Line product. My tranny shifts are butter smooth. Expensive but worth it.
B00DMA4ESE|5|Perfect OE fit
B000BUQODG|4|Easy to install with a little help from YouTube.
B00HVVVEYM|5|The bag worked well. Drove 2600 miles with it in the first two weeks, even through pouring rain.  Absolutely no seepage, bags were perfectly dry.  My only improvement suggestion would be finding an easier way to connect the straps.  I bought some simple carabiner snap clips to connect to straps so they are only used for adjustment, not to take completely off.  It was a big help.
B00HE0K9LO|4|Fits fine. Attached with plastic screws so hope it holds up.
B00OBW8XAC|4|works well
B002XM56MA|4|I replaced locks on three lock-boxes with these, and configured each for the direction expected for the way the doors swing open. However, the cams were too long, preventing the locks from going into the locked position. Fortunately, bending the cams allowed them to fit (and there was nothing in the way of the bend). Some different cam length options would have been good.
B009VYWJ0A|4|Installation was a little more than expected, I ran all the wiring from the camera and tail light through conduit to keep from chaffing. Works great, easy to see with the large 7 inch screen.
B00HPTLOIQ|5|Just what was needed.
B0049ELS54|5|Exact fit for my car- shipped quickly.
B000VHK30Y|1|Lasted less than a year worked but had to buy a replacement  within a year
B001CEG90I|5|Great price for a name brand air filter!
B00863TY8C|4|Im rating the material, which was nice.<br /><br />However this did not fit my 07 chevy colorado. IT was too long in every dimension and did not line up with the vents. I am assuming i just recieved the wrong PN.
B001FAO8I4|1|Broke after the third use. Gauge part popped off and attachment piece broke.  Cheaply made.
B00IB2S6JG|5|Correct oem part for 2009 mini cooper s
B0017OCHZO|5|Received as promised.  Just what I was looking for and a great price!
B000LW1TRU|5|I really like how it fits my face perfectly.  I'll need to wear a neck warmer with it,  but I discovered it actually makes it quicker and easier to put on and remove while a separate  neck warrmer stays in place. It works better this way.
B00AWE5I24|5|Works great. No noise always locks
B001FAK342|4|As others have stated, the finish is somewhat glossy. A quick and easy remedy to that is some PlastiDip. A few coats of that, and it will look powder coated. I did this, and it looks much better, plus it matches the paint job on my rims, taillight covers, and step bars. This cover screws directly into the existing ring that's around the gas cap and IS NOT a complete replacement, BUT it's about half the cost of a full replacement. Super easy to install, but be cautious to not overtighten the screws and strip out the holes. The magnets seem to be securely glued in, but time will tell if it will hold up. If I had to do it again, I'd probably save up and get the full replacement, but I'm still happy with my purchase. It definitely adds a nice &#34;finished&#34; look to that area.
B0080E4CW0|5|As advertized
B010OWKQVQ|5|nice touch
B002XM5G70|5|excelent performance and quiet!
B0027XEKQ8|5|Great product fast shipping
B001EOYJM6|5|Good purchase, thanks!
B000BUQOCC|5|does what it sas
B008SCRL2W|3|Came very late I order something 3 days after and I received that before this but overall is a good gas cap hasn't given me no problems on my bike
B001P27ZVE|5|Relatively easy to install rear view camera for the car.  Don't get me wrong, there is still a lot of drilling and running of wires, but the main wires from the back to the front of the car are not needed.  LCD Picture quality is decent, night time operation could be better.
B00H6XPZN6|5|These are super easy and definitely help keep things cooler. They are pretty small, as the photo indicates, so there's still a decent amount of sunlight that gets in. But the price and ease of these is great, and were as expected. The suction cups came a little bent and don't seem like a great quality, but they stuck well on day 1 so they seem to work fine. And I loved that they included 2 extras.
B000NOO798|5|Issues with 2004 Land Rover Discovery 4.6 (Best and Worst vehicle you can ever own) after doing the heads still had slight leakage, did heads again with full pressure test of everything (block/heads/etc) with nothing found, and did this as a last resort (most likely sleeves leaking which only answer is a new block $6k).  This lasted about 10k miles which was great even took a couple 1k mile trips.  BUT make sure you follow the directions...plan on a day to flush the system several time as this seems to be the key and I ran it for about a week in the system before going back to antifreeze.  While it has just started using a slight amount again I'm sold on this and getting ready to use it again.....$60 vs $6k for new is worth a shot!!  The Land Rover coolant system runs close to 20lbs pressure so I would think this would work even better on US vehicles that operate at almost half the pressure....
B0045GUQ36|5|love these brakes! stop on a dime. understandably short life but does the job. especially on the track
B007RW3KKG|5|a filter is a filter, nothing else tosay
B00HEERYQ8|1|valve stem only. no good without the other part.
B004DRWP54|5|they seem to work ok
B001CF1A6U|5|Good quality, just wish I paid more attention to the size I needed as I bought this to connect my tow strap to my 1500 pickup... not what these are used for but I found a great use for them nonetheless
B000UTQUAK|4|Works.
B0029EXC82|5|I'm very pleased with the product works looks like a charm thanks a lot Amazon.
B00877SL2M|5|Worked great for replacing interior door and under dash lights in my 99 Tahoe. Much brighter than factory lights with a cool blue glow.  Have to make sure they go in properly and not reversed or they will not work, my buddy helping thought a few were burnt out.
B00785PCVC|5|Amazing!  Smells just like baby powder, I love it, only takes a little, so this will last a good long while.  Definitely will buy again, highly recommend!
B00CRR5L8U|1|Part was described to be an &#34;exact fit&#34; for my 2000 Silverado 2500. I had the truck apart, opened the box and it has the wrong connections. Had to leave and go to the local parts store and pay more than double this price for the true &#34;exact fit&#34;. Also, was not happy that they took the return shipping cost out of my refund with no other option since the description is not accurate.
B00AQKC7LO|5|Really bright lights.  I wish the LEDs had more of a yellow tint, though.
B003V88IL6|5|My shoulders love this, Made my 2007 Yammy Vstar Tourer an ACTUAL tourer.
B000CH0C0Y|5|thank you!
B0094BFGG4|5|Works as promised and seems secure, grips well.  I use if for a SUP.
B000VU7M4Q|5|Great bed mat. Works as advertised
B0028NCB8G|5|Looks great, just as described!
B000FW2MWW|5|This longer cable has come in very handy to reach both my car and my motorcycle further away from the garage, where it is plugged in.<br /><br />The cable that came with the battery tender was only 6 feet long, which means that the actual box usually had to sit outside the garage. Now I can have the box inside the garage and still easily reach either of the vehicles that I want to connect to it.<br /><br />This is just exactly what I needed.
B008427D88|5|Worked great replacing the worn out clips on the front fender of my 98 accord V6.
B00LBRBVHW|5|Works well
B002P2YGEM|4|Served its purpose. Seems like a well made piece.
B001C97ZVA|5|Good price. Exact fit. No need to go to the auto parts store when you can have the delivered. Shipped very quickly.
B003VAUL0A|5|very pleased with the product and fast delivery...will definitely recommend your company..thanks so much.
B0046ID5EK|5|After not have keyless remote for a few years because they are expensive at a dealership. This one works great and I am so glad to have it and the price was really good too.
B003RQBKLC|4|Good product, well made.
B008FWCLHU|1|I ordered this for my car and realized it was too big.  Now I think I am stuck with it.
B000CRDMS8|5|Fantastic price
B004MTD9QM|5|Fit perfectly exactly what I expected
B00BYNJ93Q|5|I bought them to match the fronts. Smooth fits on a 2011 Tacoma
B0002UHVAA|5|makes cleaning tank easy
B00V3YT77O|4|Product and customer support is great. Weekends and after business hours, not so much.
B0056HDCUM|5|Works as advertised, really like it the two times I used it, no water spots
B005G5SD7Q|5|Beautiful
B004PXB93A|4|Can't speak for overall reliability, but it was a perfect fit for my 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe! Looked just like the original and I hope it performs well! First break-in oil change and changed to synthetic oil. I like that they also included a new crush washer for the oil drain plug! Very handy!!
B00JXLX33S|5|really cute.
B00EZ9Y33W|5|Small gauge wire but no problems in the few weeks I've had it, using with a 6&#34; light bar in the back of my Jeep
B00FYLHM5G|5|it was exactly the same as a OEM part. perfect in every way.
B004QN2TII|5|Perfect replacement. Piece to cake to install.
B00180G366|5|As expected
B00X6DE35Q|5|I have a compact car (Mazda Protege) and it fit my windshield perfectly.  I would buy this product from this company again.
B006EGAIII|5|Thanks
B001KRF4S0|5|Larger cooling fins than the original. I may have had a blockage in the original, as the truck just drove smoother once this radiator was installed.
B00Q4HH6Z0|1|Only lasted 3 months, better off buying the generic one for a 1/4 of the price
B008ESZ956|2|Is not the same as oem on BMW 740il disappointing does not work
B00E1SM53W|5|These did the trick.  Very happy with purchase.
B00THRJZSK|1|I can't really write a review because I'm not sure what to buy?? why can't ALL of these seller's add more info?<br />I own a Range Rover and the measurements are pretty clear, and you can find these on line why can't we get something beyond the assumed length?<br />width......6'3.7&#34; OR 75.7&#34;<br />height....6' 1.3&#34; OR 195&#34;<br />LENGHT 16&#34; 3&#34; OR 195&#34;<br />HOW HARD can it be to add the height which of course is way it going to be the deciding factor as to weather it covers the car correctly ?
B000C1Q6L4|5|Perfect
B00LQHR9GE|5|Nice see if it holds up.
B000B68BWW|5|Good deal!!
B002SE1G2W|5|These are the best mats ever..keeps the floor clean, with the raised sides..They really look good in my &#34;all&#34; duck outfitted car..
B001PYG9IC|2|I ordered for a 2002 Kia Spectra says it is correct on but the bleeder valve threads and line input are switched, changing my steel line around was not an option for me so I returned it.
B002MBN9HQ|5|T with he item was as advertised.  Works perfectly.  Be sure to mark your wires clearly!
B0007TJ7GW|5|My German Shepherd puppy thinks she should either be driving, or riding in the passenger seat.  Not safe in case of an accident.  This is just what I needed to keep my puppy in the back seat area.
B000FQ1X0U|5|Good product
B005Z8HAUK|4|Used many times on jeep trip.  Quick and easy.
B006BE0ZBS|1|It did not work.  Took it to Home Depot who cut it but did not work after that.
B0048F3TYW|5|Fits perfectly, with little need to adjust. Much better than the glare from melty Toyota dash (waiting for extended warranty repair). Nice fabric, much better than the &#34;carpet&#34; dash covers. Not reflection free in the window, but very, very light. Color was perfect for the interior. Kind of disappointed to think it will be removed once the dash is replaced, but the sticky residue from the melted dash won't release cleanly. Because of the melted dash, didn't need more than an inch or two of Velcro to secure the cover. Very pleased with it as a &#34;make-do&#34; until dash is repaired.
B009DJ1OWC|5|Does what it should.
B00B71RL08|4|a little tricky to hold in place and turn but it did the job
B00C15M4WO|5|Working fine
B00TCN6DT8|1|It is what it is. And you get what you pay for. If anyone plans on buying this, I hope you have some extra screws lying around because the ones that came with it to attach the fairing aren't worth squat. They're too short. Good thing I don't go for the clean look on my 94 sportster. I haven't taken it for a test ride yet. It did come early in the mail though.
B00FBKSYAM|5|Excellent item
B00NPI5X10|5|First off these are absolutely beefy as described..The price, fast shipping and the customer service were +A I have purchased all my Teraflex through offroad innovations and higly recommend them to fellow jeepers..
B00E9P9A4O|5|Deliver was on time and product was as advertised.
B000C55T7W|5|Exactly as described!  Thank You
B009DK4XK6|3|there was no instructions on, the wireing, ,.  the hole in the thunderbird  was larger then the antenna , had to make a bushing for it  I got it to go up  but it wont go back down not pleased.
B00CP6J6YI|5|On my second one of these for the Commander - not because of defects, I replaced the driver side and now someone broke the passenger one.  More of a design flaw from Jeep.  These replacements are reasonable and fit great.
B003LDIWBC|5|Exactly what I wanted!
B00EE3LW60|3|I really wish the handles weren't so cheap looking and the longer ones were built a little heavier. I deal with some fairly large o-rings at work and feel like the long ones are going to break. The handles look like a screwdriver I would buy at the dollar store.
B004V753SW|5|aaa
B00O81FME6|5|Perfect size magnet, and doesn't come off in the car wash.
B0009OMY9C|5|Helped me to dial in my cross cut sled to make perfect cuts.
B00A3JZXZK|5|First-off either throw the instructions away or use it too start your fire. Then take your commander and elevate so you can see under it. There are two positions on the under side frame where holes exist. Then mark straight across to plastic surface- measure straight up from there 5/8&#34;. Drill pilot holes then use 1 1/16 hole saw. With these holes clean punched through plastic to frame. Place slider against side using lower brackets in place not bolted. Mark your apparent location with upper third placement. Drill through as before with pilot / hole saw. When bolting only start lower bolts then attach upper and tighten 18 fpt to each bolt. Total time to install is about 45 min. for both sliders.
B0087Y64W4|5|Fits nicely on my 2013 Nissan Versa dash (truly made to fit). The material is of a great quality, I just wished they added more &#34;velcro points&#34; for a tighter fit. I'm looking forward to order more Coverking products.
B00GSAUHB8|3|It's more than adequate.
B00480BWCI|5|Love these things.  They are easy to store and easy to use.  Great price and awesome function.  Highly recommend.
B00TQHHCTK|5|It is very useful an practical, much better than the stick I've used before. I can read it very well, in my opinion, one of the best tools you can have to maintain your tires and save some gas.
B00J78FF60|4|Love this bumper sticker and the message but the picture of the cow is blurry but you can't tell from far away. I guess it doesn't matter anymore since someone took it off my car.
B007TVT05O|5|Perfect fit for my 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee , easy to install looks identical.
B002R4U72I|4|nice but edges are fragile during installation
B00CIZA0WI|4|I have to say I was pretty happy with it
B00JI9K298|5|Exactly what was needed. A few months ago my Compressor plate fell off while I was driving. I ordered this part for my 2007 Maxima, and everything fit perfectly. My order even came a few days early!
B00GXRG64I|5|Very soft rags
B00DIPU0GI|5|Quirky unique way to show your support.
B00PKZDJDA|4|Appears to be OEM replacement.
B005BNP7RW|1|I had it for two months and I have this problem
B0049EBAC0|4|Fit well good quality
B0002U2DVM|3|I didn't like the fact that there are no installation instructions for those that aren't too handy....(my wife)....working on her jeep. I figured it out and to be honest my wife would of done fine if there were some instructions.
B00SBZAG5U|2|Not a very good method of covering the screws.  The SS screw covers have to be drilled off once you install them and cannot be re-used.  Should have told you that in the pre-purchase literature.
B001UCGPUG|5|Perfect fit for my Scion XB 2006
B0069EQT88|5|Works great
B000CKGAV6|5|seem to work alright
B00F0MAZ1W|5|just perfect and my truck looks awesome.
B003BZD03K|5|Just what I needed
B0074A8L46|5|Works great! Had to go to the dealership to have it programmed. They were hesitant but it works better than the original that came with the car. Love it!
B00K75MGIM|5|great
B00N5BAWYK|5|Good foglight replacements
B004J6CS4W|5|The product is of very good quality
B0010DZZQA|5|good price, did the work
B0067ED4ME|4|Fit perfect for 2014 Prius.
B00LMI7TZ8|5|Item was as described
B001CF4UXU|5|Good quality tow strap. Will keep on my truck to use in case of emergency.
B00MQAG1X2|4|Very good quality and attractive.  I thought that it was rather pricey though.
B00F9XQ5L6|5|Its chinese, what do you expect?...haha it works..
B004GCPLX4|2|Well packaged inside an Amazon box, but could have used bubble wrap or messy Styrofoam as tip of fender was bent. Easy fix with channel lock pliers, cannot tell. No dents. Overall, fender looked nice, though thin gauge metal. The disappointment came, however, when I tried to install it. I probably should have slotted or enlarged the holes, but when I forced them to line up, it placed the fender in board from the door. I had to redrill the bottom rocker hole in the rocker panel as it simply would not line up. Some might be the truck's fault as the old fender did rub the door so I bent the door hinge fender mount brackets forward a little as they appeared bent back. It does not rub now, but the hood line is much higher than the fender in places, almost 1/2&#34; off in places...just not curved properly. Poor fit is not unusual for inexpensive non-CAPA Taiwan made body parts, but this one seemed a bit extreme. Not acceptable for any customer car, even a mediocre one. Luckily this was for my teenage son's first truck, so for the price I decided to keep it, and considering this truck had sustained damage previously and had been repaired, part of the fit issue could be the truck's fault....but I doubt it as the old (rusted) fender fit well aside from the door rub issue and the old body work was done on the roof and rear portion of the cab. I think I'll go elsewhere next time. I bought this based on price, was not expecting great quality. I'm no expert, just a hobbyist, and I ran into a poor fit on a Taiwan nose panel for a Mitsubishi Galant, but I did buy a Taiwan fender for a vintage Jeep Wagoneer from Brown's of Two Rivers that was stock gauge and a perfect fit. Satisfied with rocker covers and cab corners from Raybucks also used on this project. After repainting the truck, I still shudder when I see the  difference between the curvature of the hood and that of the fender. Cheaper is not always better. When I first opened and inspected the fender, I was delighted and wished I had ordered for the other side (rusted but not as bad as the driver's side), but after installing and seeing the poor fit, I was glad I decided to patch and repair the other fender instead of ordering one like this.
B006TMPLK2|4|Didn't come with any kind of installation kit one would think of,  luckily had some compatible screws lying around and it worked fine and sits securely.
B000UPGX92|5|took 15 minutes to change.  Same size as existing which makes installation simple.  Grease fitting is a nice improvement of stock.  Wheel has not exploded and car has not burst into flames so that is a good sign I guess
B002TO86NS|5|Work EXCELLENT - Could not be happier. Price was right and a fraction of what Harley would charge!
B00279Z3T0|5|Worked great. No more ABS light
B007FXKU8C|5|These blades are great for my Cricut Explore.
B005ESSIEI|1|Couldn't even install decal to thin, went right in the Garbage
B0010DPB3C|5|Worked good no problem
B00CX7KV3E|1|Did not come with any bolts to attach the bracket to the light
B00OZXC2S6|1|So disappointed did not fit in car right. And 3 days later it started to comeoff...this product sucks
B001H3GK7G|5|Installed Today !!! Excellent Product and Pricing. Would Buy Again From This Seller !!!
B009RZR7Z0|1|Will NOT buy again
B004RCPBUQ|5|Easy to setup and works as claimed
B0017ODVTA|4|Huge difference for me. My bulbs were old. Should have done this years ago.  Update 3/24/16..just ordered another because one burned out already...on a rarely driven van...maybe 100 miles at night...can't change now I have a four headlamp set up. I do like the increased vision. Hope I just got one that wouldn't last
B00L51X5PK|1|Not fit and useless
B008CQUUYK|5|Super glasses.  Perfect for my small face.  I bought three pairs!  Two more after the first one arrived.
B000E28N7G|5|Used on my 2015 KLR. No problems. I will say this. I bought a Wix brand filter and it came with replacement o-ring seals.  Update 5/12/16. I got another wix filter and the k&n is a better filter. It has like 15 more pleats to and is glued together not texting metal strip. And it was like $8 at O'Reillys auto parts. Go with K&N!
B000FCGS04|1|I ordered these cans, but did NOT receive a Blitz brand can, I received a Midwest one.  While it is still a 5 gallon blue can, I specifically wanted a Blitz for the shape of the can.  The Midwest ones are much harder to modify to install a vent.
B010C4GRLY|3|The car cover works as a car cover should. Unfortunately I had high hopes that it was also water resistant, which I found out the hard way. All in all, I'd say it's a good purchase, just be aware that this cover is definitely not waterproof or resistant.
B00KDM4COK|4|Fits great.  Looks good.  Appears pretty durable and solid.  I would've given it 5 stars but I was disappointed in the size of the skull.  It barely covers the hitch receiver tube opening.  Other than that personal preference, it's a nice product so far.
B00AA2G89A|5|Exactly what I wanted. The perfect hitch cover for me.
B00ZPMVKD4|3|These are ok.  Not as bright for my application need.  Packaging is good and the quality is there.
B000CB7D3Y|5|Great product, very happy with the results.
B00D3YEGO6|5|I just bought 2 of these for my new car. I was nervous about the quality and ease of installation. When they arrived you could tell just by the packaging that they were high quality. They have weight to them, not flimsy at all. There are small metal tabs in the back that your plates slide into to keep them secure. I really didn't have any trouble installing the rhinestone screw covers. I can see where the pronged nut that goes in is easily bendable but I really didn't have an issue; plus there were several extra in each box. Speaking of extras, there were 2 extra rhinestone screw covers, extra screws, nuts, and even a few tiny rhinestone in case you lose some. Once you install the screw covers I'm not sure how you would go about removing them. The instructions seemed to say that you would need a wrench and to turn it like 30 times and they should come off. Hopefully that won't be necessary. Onto the BLING....YES! These SPARKLE! They look beautiful in the sun! I haven't seen them myself at night but they probably sparkle under the license plate light, as well. You will not go wrong with these, totally worth it!
B00V30J86I|2|Was a LOT smaller than I expected and wouldn't fit in small SUV.
B005N53AM2|5|beautiful!!! i love it so much, fit beautifully on my 2002 Volkswagen Jetta!!
B000IXTGHW|5|Heater went out in car & this really helped out. Thanks!!
B00W67T1Y6|5|Wonderful
B00ESKE6JO|5|Product is as described.. Will buy again
B00DWKZRVM|1|As soon as I put the first one in and turned it on. It popped like something was about to blow up. And after it warms up it flickers...put the second light in and it just flickers and doesn't turn on half the time. Very dissapointed...and they aren't even close to an 8k. Looks more like something between 6-8
B001DRI5LA|5|Fits perfectly and works fine for my 2013 corolla S
B000C9S4RU|5|Works
B00V4FQRKM|3|Good quality although sized a little small. I usually wear a medium glove but these mediums were definitely a small by U.S. standards.
B00KCYLLNO|5|3%
B007NJOEAI|5|Worked good on my Mustang spark plugs.
B00PWWCHUM|4|product was as described. Had to replace my original GROM audio cord and this did the trick.
B00Y1HTN92|5|Worked great!!!!
B007G7PUMS|5|German Castrol / Belgian showed very good results in some applications. Euro cars love it. Not sure if it is suitable for extended oil changes, must run analysis to figure out.
B004ZIVD9A|5|Product was great and fit perfectly!
B011U2AOXY|5|It's great
B007XE6DK2|1|Be aware that even though it mentioned 260e, that.. the model doesn't require one. So alone the box sits in a corner unopened.
B00ROSZJX4|5|Quality spacers. Have had these on for just over 3000 miles. 0 issues. Great fitment on the hub and ring for wheel. Bolts have been off and on to tq a handful of times with no issues. Even had these on for a few spur of the moment mountain runs with no problems. Would buy again.
B00L94NFDU|5|Wow what a difference this makes!
B00CF5LMI2|5|Looked and fit like original but less than half price!
B000COS0PG|5|Great, Thanks!
B00150T13G|5|Awesome! My car smells wonderful for a long period of time!
B01092I9LA|1|horrible fit for the make and model is was suppose to fit. Back seat cover was very hard to put together to put on.
B00LXFBP9G|5|Sharp looking and easy install.  Very happy with them
B00HVIGWEC|5|Fits!
B0012X0I6A|5|great sevice
B00A8WXZIE|5|Perfect
B009PIO6C6|5|Fits our 2014 Nissan Altima perfectly.
B0012PM2P8|5|great ride
B00GSAUHB8|5|The sunshade works quite well as expected. It is a bit big for my 2015 Impreza Hatchback/Wagon, but it still stays in place and works fine with no issues.
B009DJB7F6|5|Works great
B0035YGLZG|4|Does what it says. Needs longer cords, in my opinion, as no one really has outlets side by side which are on seperated circuits. Otherwise, it handles my 5 hp shop vac and table saw very well.
B0044AZ4BC|5|Perfect! Thank you! Time will tell with regard to its integrity with regard to life span, but I fully expect it to perform as well as any other!
B00IWRDK0A|1|poor fit for my 2005 Sienna, after installed, annoying squeeze sound every time open or close the door. even spay alot of WD-40 on it.
B00H7PQ50U|1|Bought this package at Sam's Club. Don't waste your money! I have only tried the wax and it is not good and hard to work with. Going to ask company for full refund!
B0012Q4IPY|5|These plugs work as intended, but they gave me hell because of issues with my order and issues during installation. My first order came in busted up because it was improperly shipped with some other bulkier items. One of the plugs wasn't even the right item! Looked like I received someone's returns. Second replacement shipment came in okay, but had no stuffing to prevent the plugs from flying around in the box. 2 plugs came out, but I think the round cardboard piece around the threads prevented any damage.<br /><br />I installed these on a 2004 Toyota Rav4 with about 71,000 miles (plugs had been replaced once before by my dad sometime before). They replaced a set of NGK's. Upon installation my car had rough idling, low rpm's (500 or below when idle), and threatened to die on me on occasion. Had to take them back out and done what I should have done in the beginning - measure the gap. They were off by a little and once I re-gapped them and took the car out for a spin everything went back to normal.<br /><br />Car seems to run smoother and quieter. Hoping the new plugs will break in within the next few days and my mpg's will improve a little.
B00TQ4IKJO|5|Sound,not a perfect fit though
B000C18Q3A|5|I originally bought 4 of these unknowing that I had to have to halogen lights to use as brights. I sent the two extra back, and that was as easy as pie. They're terrific, bright and soft white which makes me very happy. Plus...a very easy install, I own a 74' K10 Chevy truck.
B000B68V6I|5|good stuff
B00T2YXMBY|5|Great
B0091B56TO|5|Good product
B000NK7992|4|Excellent  for my car toyota camry 2009 ,but the box very big size
B004NMWSQK|4|Pretty nice boots. They fit comfortably and well for my YFZ450. Would have givin them 5 starts but there are not good at keeping water out.
B000FW2MC2|5|Great for using on my riding mower
B0017OFTB8|4|Very bright, but wish it was white.
B00192JGN0|5|work great
B00WFS7ERM|4|Overall, it works well and made my 2015 X5 (F15) looks better.  The product seems solid, and the 3M tape appeared to be of good quality.
B00W8IM2KI|5|I get a lot of positive comments.  Huge sticker and hilariously covers the scratch in my door from someone's careless use of a shopping cart.
B00CO858JO|5|Very nice and great price
B0002KKTFO|4|Product instructions are very limited. The device is well-made and functions as expected. But, if you have no previous experience with this type of unit, you will have to look elsewhere for operating info.
B0040CYWX0|4|worked as expected ,would buy again
B000C94EWY|5|Drop in replacement for the secondary catalytic converter and associate piping for 2001-2004 Nissan Frontier with 3.3L V6
B001NZZAGU|5|Great Product!
B0007TQWM4|5|This stuff works great for repair of trailer black water tank.  This is the second repair on this tank (different place), and the first one is going strong after almost 10 years.
B00U5G8KE2|5|Great product @ a GREAT price  half of other similar products .. Love this fender eliminator.. I was able to use( all ) of my original lights which are much better seen than after market ones . I recommend this tail tidy to any one it was a very good purchase . I will use it again on another of my scooters .<br />JOE
B00JTM9A5Q|5|I have a heavy duty screen door, and it kept slamming so hard, knew eventually someone was going to get hurt.  I tried to adjust the door so it wouldn't slam, and noticed that it had these weird shaped screws.  I had no idea what I could do to tighten them in order to adjust the door when I came across these on Amazon.  I decided to try them, and they are wonderful little screw drivers.  It helped with the door slamming, and also went around the entire house looking for things to tighten.
B00K7X92BI|5|Great; exactly what I needed for my Bass Boat.
B0009JKI72|5|Perfect fit. They keep the windshield clear and no streaking or squeaking.
B00496MD60|1|This was.not the part it said it was.  It didn't fit my 2009 GMC Acadia.  The part I received was for a different.make and model.
B0057ZLOLC|5|We were unsure about buying this, but after it arrived, we installed it into our 2011 RAM 3500 truck. It fit perfectly. Will will buy this again when needed.
B0002JMRWI|5|GREAT
B0087V2IYA|3|Paint started peeling...into the trash it went
B00IXW0H3W|5|good deal
B00U27IZPS|3|Did not come with an instructions on what wire is the ground or otherwise. Both wires the same color. Had to figure it out through trial and error. Otherwise works well.
B0000AY69N|5|waterproofing sunbrella worked good
B00BNX88ZW|5|Exact fit and cheaper than local store even after shipping.
B00AUKFNWA|5|Heavier than I imagined.  Very nice under our grill!!!
B00HS5RHLK|5|Great fit and great price ,second set I've got from this company for second vehicle, definitely recommend these and the company
B000CFOAY0|5|3.09 including shipping. Really? Worked perfect. Don't know how it could be that cheap.
B002MQCYO0|5|The absolute best!!!!!
B00TLQNU1U|4|Good
B00GYI1ICQ|5|For my new 2015 Honda Rubicon Deluxe model, Warn recommended winch plate was a several peice unit that had too many bolts and nuts. This KFI after market one was way simpler to install. Great product and great price
B003ZKJ0XU|1|Bad product. Despite instructions saying there are 4 adapter pieces, only 3 were included. Apparently, it is standard for the pipe that attaches to shifter to be scratched up. Do not buy this, product looks to be used.
B0118S9120|5|This German helmet did meet my expectations
B00JXLX1P8|5|really cute
B0042B4B3U|1|Doesn't work very well.
B004804NNI|5|great
B000PA00XM|5|Works 100%
B00192JFI6|5|Great
B0007M30BC|5|Works great. A++
B003POLA84|3|worked so so clay did not hold up to good
B002UC17GW|5|Fit exactly on my motorhome
B00OM6AJV8|5|Perfect fit and great service!<br />Just as expected !
B000DELUQG|1|No it was the wrong threads to my truck and was junk
B000C55SXW|3|ok
B007RRTK14|5|Good stuff
B00X7FF3Q6|5|Installs in less than 5 minutes! Snaps in and fits perfectly. So strong, one lift held up hood very strongly while the other was installed. So strong, hood pops up so strongly when opened after both lifts were installed.<br /><br />Note: Acura TL hood is heavy - if your lifts are as weak as mines were (0 power), you may need assistance holding up your hood to install the first lift, especially if you can not hold the hood with head as you install the first lift. (How I did mine).<br /><br />Excellent product thus far!.
B00CSWEJZU|1|Is like a regular towel with a higher price 👎
B00KJ17Y2C|5|A durable looking light with some awesome light output. If it whistles, play with the angle at which you point it to minimize the sound.
B00H93BY88|5|Love the smell of squash! After awhile you will get used to the smell and not notice it anymore but its still there.
B004NUZ50I|5|Bday gift for friend 2 sizes wrenches will work on other than BMW too
B001NYHNW0|5|As advertized
B00GSAUHB8|5|Easy to use. Works well.
B00CHI8ACI|5|Works as it describes..
B000N9VP02|5|Great value for the price. If you are looking for quality rope, buy it!
B005EV1UQ8|5|Good quality material. On the back window of the car, been asked where I got it from by other vizsla owners
B000VIGLP4|4|I like them well enough. They fit and look great. Just wish they were a tiny bit heavier
B00IQWD8UI|4|One for the rear hatch window and two small ones for the side glass, look good.
B007V2CVRK|5|freakin love this thing. Though it could be a inch or 2 taller
B0002ILK1S|5|A suitable replacement for the Yuasa 12v 2.3 amp/hr battery that came with my microwave radio phone.
B00U868BN4|5|It works!
B00BCR7B02|5|I would like to report that this time the seat covers worked out perfectly unlike the previous ones that was received that shredded as soon as they were being put on.
B0038YPF28|3|A bit too heavy
B005JZSP08|5|Worked in dodge pickup but not in Chevrolet.
B00MAMGYME|5|Gave it to my daughter for her office.  She wanted it badly
B00EKPOG10|4|Solid item, for the price, used to make light up shoes.
B00CDD525A|3|Updating my review. 1 year and 4 months of use, its dead. Wasn't dropped or abused, I used it at most once a week for bigger jobs like head gaskets etc... worked fine for all that time about a week ago i go to turn it on and nada, tried a replacement bulb, no go.
B00CP0VHD2|5|I bought two--one for each car. They're 4-in-1, relatively compact, and great to have in the front seat consoles, in case of emergencies while on the road. You never know.
B00EGWC7GS|5|good
B0019ICVEU|5|Only needed three o-rings out of the pack but they worked.
B00XBEJZA8|5|Hubby is happy! So I bought these for my husband's Chevy Colorado truck. He leaves for work very early when is very dark, here in PA there's lots of deer. Therefore, I thought adding these would be nice so that he's able to see better at night. They are fantastic. The light is very bright. This is a quality product and not difficult to install, my husband did it on his own. Thank you so much!!! I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
B005XOYG0S|4|good
B0083TYGSW|5|I love these! Super easy to slip into my seats. Fit perfectly! My friends have even asked me for the link to buy this because they were so surprised by how good it looked!
B0002CSQ6Q|5|Great price and great look.  I'd rather not have covers on my KC lights, but apparently in Virginia, all lights above the foglights must be covered.
B007ICI4R4|5|I just wanna say..... BUY THIS STUFF!!!<br />Like right Now.<br />My member is freakish and I had to suffer with hand jobs for the longest time because I wouldn't fit.<br />Not anymore. Since I bought this I've been drained more times than a rechargeable AAA.<br />Me and my sister have been making up for lost time  and it's amazing.  This stuff is God<br /><br />10/10
B012IJX5DY|5|The lights look sweet in the dark. Installation was easy. Took me 5 minutes on each light. The LEDs plug right into light socket and are plenty visible in sunlight. The LEDs replace the use for a traditional bulb.
B001HRDNL8|5|This product worked great. No oil leaks after installation. Thank you very much.
B008N2JNE6|5|Nothing special(it's genuine parts), but it's good.
B004EKVRPY|4|Fit my trailer well. Welded nicely. Only drawback is it doesnt come with a coupler pin, but hey, not bad for $19. $3 for a coupler pin and your still saving $.
B004VODQ0M|5|the best epoxy glue I never used
B00295NV0U|1|Started leaking while truck was just setting there. I did not notice it until the headlights turned a dark color. Then I noticed that they were completely full of water. Both sides.
B00MP6M5K0|5|Necessary item for OSHA regulations.  You can clearly see pictogram.  I'm happy to have found them on Amazon.
B009S9RR1Y|5|People laugh when they use my guest bathroom!
B00DHQPTMS|3|Good fit from left to right, but front to back it is a few inches short; part of the sun-visors are exposed...
B00VSQAQC2|5|Product works great, very easy to use.  Remember that your ignition key must be turned on before the reader will read the codes, otherwise you will get an error.  Great seller too!
B010N7RW2S|5|I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review would be fair and honest. This Anker Powercore Jump Starter 600 is a amazing piece for emergency situations like stranded in Alaska in a winter storm with a dead battery. This is life saving in so many ways, first keep it in your trunk emergency bag with blankets and perishable food. Second jump your car (with a flashlight) to get to safe shelter, and third charge your phone to call for help. The exterior is flat black with yellow highlights and the portability with the carrying case for the cables and storage for the chargers. Anker hit this one on the head.i jumped my dead battery in my Chevy Tahoe with no problems, started right up and still had 98% charge then my 95 Toyota Camry left it with 97%. now i am charging my Iphone 4 from completely dead started at 6:30pm and fully charged at...8:05pm  Compared to another competitors product [[ASIN:B00SH1SN6C RAVPower 500A Peak Current Portable Car Jump Starter Power Bank with 12000mAh Capacity (Advanced Safety Protection and Built-In LED Flashlight, 1A & 2A iSmart USB Charging Ports)]]. Anker has this beat hands down, no comparison in size and product warranty along with their top notch customer service that i have personally dealt with. I love this product and you will too.
B00YR8V2IU|5|Just received this item yesterday, so far it looks great and fits very well.  It looks very high end.  It is a good value, time will tell how it stands up but would recommend it!<br /><br />The only issue is how to use the key when needed.  The cover does not allow the use of the key unless you take the cover off.  It may not be an issue, the last BMW I had for six years and never needed to use the key.
B000A0CA6W|5|nice price
B004W4OLU0|5|Look great!
B000NCOKZQ|5|It's a basic battery connector.  It would be nicer if it came in a longer length, but if you have basic wiring skills, you can easily extend the wire leads.
B000B8N3J6|5|Works as it should. Very easy to install and remove.. Highly recommend!
B000VB1JCG|3|Made of a harder plastic, so they have a tendency to slide around. Was a little surprised by this. Will definitely consider Husky liners next time.
B0068C0EUA|5|Should have ordered two since the first item i ordered had two  i would nhave had a spare thansk fornthe help
B003ZYS8UW|4|Works great.  The only drawback is the output from the 12 volt plug is only 5 amps. I bought a portable compressor for my tires but it needs 15 amps even though its fairly small.  I have to plug it into the car, which is a little less convenient
B00NPIN8FI|5|Very bright, very pleased with these.
B003PI1BD4|5|This hitch seems very well designed and constructed.  It took me about 1/2 hour to install on my own using a few 2 x 4 blocks for support.
B005FFZC76|2|Loved it at first. Within a week, the plastic bends and it won't hold very well. Great concept and idea. Weak product
B008A5XZ4U|5|Yes, thank you very much!
B000C77UYA|5|Great size and received it earlier than promised.
B00TPZREQ4|5|great gift for someone who loves bigfoot. great product
B000RFOP86|5|Exactly what was advertised!
B003VGHBMA|5|Excellent
B000C2EFV6|5|Fits as expected, keeps the oil inside the engine. I don't know what else there is to say...
B000U26UKM|5|It does the job it was designed to do.
B00KFMHAH4|5|Very easy to install, instructions easy to follow, yes I actually read the instructions.
B012GW8QAA|5|These are AWESOME!  With a 15 year old who is about to begin Driver's Ed, I hope that the other drivers around our neighborhood/town/county will appreciate these decals.  There are several in the package, so we can use them on whatever vehicle he is practicing in - easy on, easy off magnetics.  I received this item at a moderate discount in exchange for a fair, honest review - would buy them AND recommend them for any parents of new drivers.  Hopefully it will cut down on dirty looks, honks, and other not-so-friendly driver exchanges that may result as our new drivers learn to maneuver through what can be some mean street; as well as the lack of patience from more seasoned and cranky drivers!
B00AWPHSTY|3|While the module would fit and I am sure it works, the harness supplied doesn't. The wire connector which goes into the diagnostic plug on my GTX-155 '15 is supposed to be female but the supplied harness comes with a male. Exchanged for another and it was the same. Photos, instructikns and on-line blogs call for a female wire connector. Talking to Sea-doo now to see what can be done.
B00ECWFC0U|5|I like it
B007KPU1CU|5|Fits good in saddlebag
B005VNWT6E|5|WOW!  They got one for sale out there. With that kind of monopoly they charge whatever they want, as you can tell.  It's called &#34;PRICE GOUGING&#34; !
B00C0SQPOA|5|Work well and keep me legal at night. Very happy.
B001FJCUGC|5|Works great, but looks like it could break easily, so keep that in mind when installing/removing it from your vehicle.
B000N3GABC|5|OK
B0002H335A|5|I trust these stands when I work on my car...they are heavy..and strong.. ..real steel...smooth operation
B0012INT98|5|ok
B00KNMKRU8|5|I purchased this charger to replace an old &#34;big iron&#34; dumb battery charger that I had lost trust in. After a few years of use, it just never seemed to work right. A battery charger is one of those things like a ladder. It can be ignored until its needed, and then nothing else works as well. I have no complaints about this charger and lots of words of enthusiasm for it. Calling it &#34;smart&#34; is an understatement. For example, should you connect it backwards nothing happens. No sparks - just a panel display. As dumb as it sounds, it seems to &#34;know&#34; what you are charging. I've charged motorcycle batteries, car batteries and gel cells with it, and its never over charged. Its more or less idiot proof. It also offers other functions that I have not tried such as an alternator test and &#34;battery restore&#34;. The display lets you know whats going on too. Its amazingly light.  This one is in the Sweet Spot for price/ performance. Recommended.
B00CA7FPYM|4|Fit great in my 99 jeep Cherokee.  Seem to be a good shock for the money.
B00N3HC9XI|5|product just as good as other non OE lenses at 1/2 the cost
B005NILH9C|4|little pricey
B001P2BK24|1|Love Koni's but this particular product arrived as only one shock, and it was very clear that you would only fit one shock in a box.
B0071HE2DG|5|Worked great.  Used it mainly for bluetooth speakers in my 3/4 helmet on the ride to Sturgis.  They were definitely loud enough to hear the music.
B00EF3XQH2|5|Works great!
B006OQ35GU|5|CAMCO PRODUCTS Wiork Simple Thick Clear Construction.love the swivel action for hose Adjustments ! a 45 sweep to align to the Mai line !
B00V3YU6D8|5|Good quality and easy to install
B00B2B4D4A|3|Gave me a nice lift overall on my 2015 JKU...unfortunately I thought it would level out the rake, but it didn't.  Here are several pictures before and after...I also added 1.5&#34; spacers and on the final picture I have some 285/75/17's on it.<br /><br />Instructions were a little vague, but it was doable in a few hours with a couple jack stands, a case of beer and a friend.
B0078J1SUC|5|I love the decal! Looks real nice on my car, along with the OIF and OEF decals. Thanks, Seller!!
B00LMF0ZY8|5|Louder than ome. Glad I bought them.
B00INZ65B2|5|I have a 2006 Chevrolet Silverado whose instrument panel gauges started going out one by one until only the oil pressure and temperature gauge remained working. Doing some research, I found that this was a common issue with this year model in which the gauges original stepper motors were failing. I ordered this kit at the beginning of June and, being an Amazon Prime member, I received my order on time in two days after I placed the ordered.<br /><br />***Please be aware that even though this is a much cheaper alternative, if you have no knowledge of soldering, especially when working with PCB(printed circuit boards), I'd strongly recommend you have a professional repair the instrument cluster.*** Either way, while you have the instrument panel off, save yourself some time and frustration in the future by replacing ALL the stepper motors at the same time simply because chances are the other motors will eventually fail as well and then you'll be disassembling the instrument panel all over again. If you think you can do this task on your own, do some research online.  There are quite a few &#34;how to&#34; videos out there for this particular replacement/repair.<br /><br />I replaced all the motors and almost 3 months later, all gauges are working fine. Definitely saved me quite a few bucks by purchasing this kit!!
B000JFHNG0|5|Excellent quality. Got tired of renting/borrowing a set for maintenance needs. This was just as good as the much more expensive set I always borrowed for the auto parts store.
B00D329B8Y|5|Only issue is that it smells a little bit like new rubber in my car. Other than that its nice and heavy, doesn't slip around like the other clear cheap plastic ones I had.
B0017M8HPA|4|Light weight, plenty of power. Very easy to mount and operate. A little noisy, if that bothers you. Works great for me.
B0015353XU|4|Let me say this - excellent product!! 4-star rating... only because their hard-wire port doesn't take 6 AWG wire. Part of my design called for 6 AWG wire from this inverter to an automatic transfer switch (also a Go Power product - great investment by the way). Low and behold, the hard-wire port doesn't like 6 AWG wire. Other than that... this inverter works wonderfully.
B00873J0YY|3|J-bar racks themselves work great.  But the straps that were included are junk.  Two off them broke w/o much strain while on the road!Fortunately no harm done but this could have been very dangerous!
B000VL6AHU|5|fit well in 2011 toyota corolla
B003O0Z0H6|5|Had super easy installation directions! Superior Quality.
B000C8230U|4|Works wonderfully in my 2003 acura tl-s.
B003A4QISQ|5|works fine
B009FUF6DM|5|I really need to order more of these.  They are fantastic and clean well with or without cleanser. They are abrasive, so be careful what you use them on.
B004MSZC6S|1|Didn't fit right or just didn't work for my motorcycle , not sure why , had to return.
B000C2Y3DQ|5|Excellent replacement for my '69 el Camino
B0002SQYUA|5|I have needed a vaccum pump and gauge for quite some time and kept putting off the purchase because of reviews of cheaper models.  I had read the reviews on this one and decided that I would give it a shot.  I needed for testing an older model Toyota that uses vaccum for switching things used in the Cruise Control.  This thing is heavy, which is just fine with me as I know it won't be melting if I touch an exhaust or radiator accidentally.  I love the ease at which you can rotate the gauge on the pump too.  This is a keeper for any vaccum jobs you may need to do. I'm sure it will work as brake or liquid bleeder because of how well it's made.  I also love the fact that it comes with it's own case.  Everything is in one place when I need to use it.
B000C804QU|5|Excellent replacement part for my '69 el Camino
B0089LTW06|5|Good
B0009Y2CFS|2|oh no, i already dont' like this... just opened package...  the item i got was a lower powered one then specified on the descriptions!  size is similar but the one i received is only 55w?  so it will be only half the warmth?  not sure if others have experienced this, or even noticed this... but yea... i hate getting items not described correctly.  i am going to test it this weekend and report back.
B00ZCGKVSS|5|These are very nice and bright! Very happy with this product.
B00XAX4B9A|4|This product seems to work well.  It is very light so is easy for my elderly mom to manage in putting up in the windshield. Not the same rigidity as the multifold type.  Decision as to what serves better is a matter of preference.
B00TGB692W|5|It is perfect! And being white shows up very well on my tinted window. I would tell everyone that has a soft spot for snakes to get one.
B00BPIQV0Y|5|It is indeed a sticker. working exactly how i expected a sticker to function. to stick....
B00IMMFBIO|5|Ty for Excellent parts at great prices aaaaaaa+
B000NSJA3M|5|WORKS WONDERFUL
B0050NGB32|5|Just what I needed. Thanks
B00BITJZ6M|5|Nice product. Very very good price
B00NLUU1SC|5|I am pleased with these bulbs. At first I was worried that they would be too long for my corner light assembly. But, it fit. The description  is right. They are extremely bright.
B00U0B75B6|4|Nice helmet
B0057XZJJW|5|Good quality
B005GCSSS8|5|Perfect fitment!
B003VFNZEY|4|These work great and look good while riding. Awesome glasses for the price.
B00J62HHFO|5|Fast deliver, price was good, installed in 2011 Ford F-150 ecoboost with 80,000 miles and puts like a kitten would recommend for ecoboost owners
B00EPNFRFQ|5|Best battery maintainer..
B001F9FM9Y|5|Excellent product quality. Lift was exactly as stated and I installed the kit at home. The installation manual was very helpful. I did not use the camber bolts as my vehicle had camber bolts that were adjustable. The lift did not impact on the quality of the ride. I am very pleased with this product.
B004IBZS04|5|Gift.
B000FGJQBI|5|It is a great product
B00MFDF1BI|4|Not a Fog Lamp cover but a reflector cover.  Has nice fit but had to use some more 3M double side tape to get bottom to stick well.  Have purchased other chrome trim from bleqi and all fits nicley.  Delivery time is very slow, from 3 to 4 weeks.
B004I0HGSM|5|good product. looks great
B007JSGR9Y|1|This thing is about useless . Hasn't worked since day one . Don't have 3 weeks to waste on another one so I'll just trash this snd take it as a lesson learned . Don't waste your time or money on this one .
B00CQLNRR4|5|This works very well, even though it's not as sticky as.some of the gel pads on the market.  The bestimated part is reading the instructions which are literally translated from Chinese.
B00JIVRV2W|5|Fits great.
B006TMRFHY|5|Perfect
B000C1Q68M|5|Very good brake pads for my 2006 Honda Civic LX Coupe. I changed it myself and very easy to replace it though it is my first time repairing a car.<br />Before I changed the pads, I felt that the car cannot go easily, feeling like something forbbiden it ahead however I gave the gas. But after the replacement, the car drives fast when I release the brake peddal, but stops smoothly and immediately when I press the brake. I enjoy the driving very much after the replacement. Strongly recommend it to anyone who needs it.
B00BNLLSAG|5|Product is as expected.
B00KC6I3ME|4|Great way to rep your city and your favorite  teams.
B00RW7EVKO|5|Very good quality and functions perfectly.
B00NHBYOA6|3|I decided to test this cooler before I was actually going to use it on my road trip. I purchased the optional ac adapter in order to use it indoors. I placed a thermometer inside the cooler and then turned it on. Keep in mind that my home is air conditioned. After 30 minutes the cooler only reached 67 degrees and after 60 minutes it only dropped to 54.7 degrees. I am nervous about using it if I can't get it to 40 degrees and maintain it at that temperature while on the road. A bit disappointed with the claims this cooler came with. Food safety is very important to me and I don't feel that this cooler will keep my food safe. I will be selective in what I use the cooler for. I don't even want to test the heater function.
B0093A9HHA|5|Product is perfect, exactly as described.  Fit my Lexus IS250 like a glove. Very happy with this product.
B003FCNX2C|5|awesome
B00F0CILM2|4|Fine, as advertised.  No complaints.
B00KTHU1QM|5|Works great with my Infiniti QX56!
B003JO38C6|5|I've never used a sisal wheel before, so I had no idea what to expect.  I've come to discover that when these wheels are new, lots of stuff flys off the wheel the first time you run it on the machine. Be prepared for that. This is the break-in period. After that, the wheel performs very well.
B000E3DUDM|5|looks good rides nice
B00CH6T18C|5|Used this on my leather couch, love seat, chair, and Ottoman.  It worked great.  Restored the color and help to soften the leather.  I followed the directions and used one rag to apply; set for a minute or so, then buff with a clean rag.<br /><br />I will buy this product again.

B00287J4TQ|5|Good quality prod
B00EPVKJU6|5|Quick next day shipping. Very pleased.
B000HRX1JS|4|This is a very nice bag.  Down one star because it does not attach to the seat to well.
B0007RS4BS|1|Fragrance doesn't even last .  I definitely wouldn't order this again  waste of money
B000SL4AA2|5|this is a great little pump to keep in your car for emergencies. i actually keep it in my trunk and use it to make sure my bike tires are filled to spec every time i go out riding. it's simple to use and is quick to fill a bike tire. i also keep our car tire in check and it fills at about 2psi a minute. great small  cheap 12V alternative to a large 120V floor model. 5 stars
B00318V5KM|5|Great price!
B004306VTC|5|I purchased this to use on the ground in front of our camper.  It replaced a much heavier, much more expensive rug that had gotten worn down.  My biggest issue with the former rug was it's bulk.  It took up a TON of room when rolled up and not in use.  The biggest benefit of this mat is it's size when not in use.  It folds up into a bag that's literally about the size of a camping chair.  And it weighs next to nothing.  It's rather amazing, really.  It's a great looking rug - it looks every bit as nice as my more expensive rug did.  And it's much much easier to clean.  It sweeps off easily or it's also easy to pick up and shake off because it's so light.  My only complaint about this is that it's so lightweight, that you really feel every rock and bump in the ground underneath it.  Not a huge deal, but if you're barefoot it's not particularly comfortable to walk on.  If that's not a huge concern for you, though, then this is definitely a worth-it purchase.
B009S2WYP0|1|When they put this arm together in china, they installed the bar backwards so that the grooves were on the nut side not the chassis side ,the controll arm would slip out of adjustment . to repair it the bushings had to be replaced and the bar re installed in the arm
B00QRHDIPY|5|Good
B000F2M830|3|keeps the glare of the sun off my dashboard
B00GSAUHB8|5|Just what I neesed. Fits nicely in the window of my Highlander. Easy to fold and I just skip it next to the seat
B00DQJB7EK|1|I want my money back.. after having this antenna about a month it started changing colors. It is now a goldish color and no longer black. It does work however..
B000C2S9G8|5|Fits a 67.5 Datsun 1600

B00IENS66A|1|Unfortunately they don't fit my 2015 prius v and to get a dang on refund you have to pay to ship them back what kind of place does that won't ever buy anything from this place again the carpets are very small too
B000CSD28M|5|Just what I needed. Thanks
B00651CBO6|3|The base lets the connector rust.  Whatever metal they used causes rust, make sure to put grease on it.
B000C9WJ8K|5|Just what I needed. Thanks
B009FUF6DM|5|This is my first foray into the world of microfiber cleaning cloths. I would probably try to find a softer version for cleaning delicate electronics, but these work great for scrubbing household surfaces.<br />They do a great job--I use homemade cleaning spray (dish soap, orange oil, water) on counters, and just the wet cloths on sink faucets, mirrors, shower tiles, and everything else. They shine up my chrome faucet and stainless sink with almost no effort. The three colors allow me to designate cloths for the kitchen/bath/remainder of the house--since I wash them all together, I shouldn't care, but it is nice to know your kitchen counter cloth didn't scrub your shower scum. I draw the line at toilets, but I use them for pretty much everything else. They even got the stickiness off the buttons on the back of the stove. I had tried various cleaners, magic erasers, nothing worked until this. Now we finally have non-gross oven buttons! They have not managed to degrease the wall behind the stove, however, but I'm not sure anything will. (Previous owners clearly loved cooking meat and were not so fond of cleaning walls. Eventually a backsplash will probably be the only solution.)<br /><br />They haven't impressed me with their absorbency, but we have a stack of cotton prefold diapers for spills, and I doubt much will compete with those.<br /><br />I generally wash and dry the cloths on normal cycles, though dryers are not recommended. They do cling to the other laundry and attract small bits of lint, but I'd rather deal with that then hanging them all to dry individually.<br /><br />My only gripe is the yellow color. Blue and white are great colors for cleaning, but the yellow just makes me think of pee and cheese (not necessarily at the same time.) I assigned the yellows to the kitchen, hoping the cheese association would win out, but pretty much any other color would be preferable. Even pink. But aside from my personal issues with the color yellow, they work great!
B0029TQDLA|5|The product was as advertised and arrived very promptly. Thank you.
B00DE94AU0|4|It does the job, I was not satisfied with first one. It only lasted a few months.
B000CMH310|5|I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of installation.
B000BQSIWK|5|I have used this charger for over five years now and it is still going strong.  This charger has brought back several abused battery's for me.  I recommend using the trickle charge method on battery's that you really are trying to get back working.  I hook it up outside on a dry night under the hood or in the shop with windows left open on the battery set to trickle charge since battery's let off hydrogen gas when charging, and it will automatically stop charging when it is done charging.  It has brought almost every single battery I have put it on back to life without me having to attend or change settings.  I recommend using the trickle charge option if the battery was abused until it finishes it will let you know when it's done or if you have a bad battery.
B00EHIP1IM|5|great product
B00J9PQDQM|5|Super affordable compared to other brands, does the job. Would have given 5 stars if all moving parts had a square head that I could grab with a wrench
B006LJ8XUI|5|Great product
B000HAXF1O|5|Needed to be lubed
B002FY28QS|5|It's works great, it was for my girlfriends car, the installation was easy and the package came sooner than expected.
B000V2W0GE|5|went on easy and seems to do what it was made for, nice particulate viewing ability as well.
B0009I4U18|5|Was very easy to install though I wish is included a bracket to mount it to the bumper
B007FGR852|5|perfect for the chopper
B00LJYBLMC|5|Quick shipping, keys work, great price
B00KMM6A6Y|5|Super bright head Turner
B000BZGKCG|5|The only filter I use.<br />Good quality filter for the money.<br />They seem to work well and never a leak.<br />Same price here as local, but with Amazon prime<br />shipping, it saves in the long run.
B0065LTR98|1|Sharp corners ended up cutting the vinyl
B000E28MTU|5|Saved money.
B007NGB5Y4|5|I like these much more than I thought I would. I ordered a small and they are a little big, but I am kinda scrawny and I was able to make them fit perfect without a tailor.
B002JH6RK4|2|The Actual Caliper was great, but the Brake Pads that were included were too thick and I had to go to an auto parts store after I had taken my rear wheel off to get new pads that would fit.  The included pads would not let me even install the Caliper on the Rotor, I had this same issue with the other Raybestos Caliper I ordered for the other side.  Also, this one was made of a much cheaper material and was much less rugged as the other Caliper I ordered. Dissapointed in that.
B004HLDR3A|5|Black Mazda OEM filter is the best for the car.
B00VFEX9X0|1|The picture is totally misleading. The decal says &#34;plasmid&#34; not &#34;plasmids&#34;. That's a large difference. Also the decal it's white not black. I know the description says white but the picture is completely misleading.
B00200AL7K|5|Arrived quickly and undamaged.  Product as described.  Good vendor and fast shipping.  Product works well.
B0046DQTQQ|5|Everything is absolutely perfect with this item. The packaging was top notch, something you'd expect with a ultra expensive purchase.<br />I love these license plate holders.. Plus I get compliments galore about them.<br />Very sparkly and pretty. Great quality!
B0028QVNGO|2|1 bug center of glasses and does not clean off,tried everything too no avail.will need new lense or throw them out.
B00651C5SS|1|If I could rate this 0 stars I would. It gets one star for all the parts being in the package. This antenna got horrible reception and bent really bad when driving. Didn't last an hour on my truck and went straight to the trash. Cheap junk.
B00MY3QIX4|5|looks original to me, though have not installed it yet.
B003BG9XDK|4|I like it but it's a bit unwieldy to manage on one's own. Really fits well and keeps the heat out.
B004QPKYS8|4|The boots feel great but, like others have said, run a bit small. My feet are a little on the wider end and I usually wear a size 10 US but got a 10.5 in these boots and it is a snug fit, very comfortable though.<br /><br />The Boa closure system always felt secure and never failed. The velcro is showing wear but, after 14000 miles wearing them through every kind of environment, you'd kind of expect that; it's not the main closure anyway so it's no issue that it's starting to weaken. The soles of the boots show minimal signs of wear and are still attached to the rest of the boot firmly.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the boots are not actually &#34;waterproof/breathable&#34;. I would classify them as showerproof because, in continual or heavy rain, they will soak through eventually and take ages to dry. Personally, I would have preferred to have them without the liner and improved breathability so that my feet didn't sweat so much while riding through tropical Central America.<br /><br />Overall, they are comfortable, durable boots and I'd definitely recommend them for the price.
B00SYCR8HY|5|Just as described. Very fast shipping. I purchased 3, one for a 52&#34; LED light bar, one for a 20&#34; light bar and one for a set of 4&#34; LED spot lights. These cables are wired to run 2 lights simultaneously. In my case, I only needed this for the set of 4&#34; spot lights. The other 2 light bars I simply snipped and capped the 2nd power wire. Would recommend to anyone looking to add some lights!
B007AOQQ52|5|Perfect fit! Bought it about two months ago and today, it saved my car. I put a bag with trash to take it to the dumpster and apparently, it had a hole and leaked through. Ughhhhh..., hateful!! This protected the rug. Just cleaned and wiped!!
B00T6J9TL2|5|Nice product, good price, fast setvice
B00QF8ZGIC|5|the equipment was easy to install mine was placed into a x-type Jaguar that has been chipped so now I have the sound to go with the increasing torque
B000JFNAAS|5|Great product & prompt delivery was what I needed.
B002WV27XI|2|The tank bag fit the tank well; however, it was not very useful as a tank bag as the single main pouch has no dividers and only two tiny pockets so everything you put in there will become mixed up together. The map pocket is mostly covered by the zip and the readable section is so low that there is no possible way you could look at it while riding without risking running off the road. The bag itself is not waterproof either and comes with no waterproof cover so whatever you have in there is guaranteed to get wet when it rains, even the map.<br /><br />Overall, I would not recommend this tank bag, spend your money elsewhere.
B00JRE8J80|4|add was a little hard to understand and it was shipped from China took awhile
B00NCTS7P6|5|Product arrived fairly quickly despite international shipping. Made of real wood with very beautiful grain. Fits the phone well. The wood itself will probably break if the phone is dropped onto a hard floor, but it should protect the phone. Overall a pretty nice product, especially for the price.
B00JGAS2P0|5|excellent
B005J43I56|1|Did not fit my Can-Am Spyder RTS
B000NCOKZQ|5|Great
B00I3RC186|2|I got it installed thru a mechanic. I did get the ABS activated sometimes when I apply the brake now even though there is no road condition that requires the ABS activation. Planning to take it back to the mechanic to check it out..
B00GSAUHB8|5|Fits great for my 2015 crv, easy to use and folds up great!
B00BYNJ7OW|5|Fit my F350 perfectly!
B00V2XHMBY|4|does a good job installed on Yamaha Rhino
B00H6XPZN6|5|I love it! Perfect fo this summer. I have 2 boys and we travel a lot. This help keep the sunlights from blingding their eyes. My youngest son hated getting sun on his eyes. Cries and screams and I don't want to be distracted by that while driving. If you don't have 1 of this yet I recommend you to get one.
B004LLQNL4|5|Great for winter months. Use it on my prius. No problems so far. Survived all of last winter. Stored it for the summer. Hopefully it works when I get it out of storage for this winter. Not too hot that it is uncomfortable. Just right for me.
B005XA6T7A|5|It worked! Our rear window would not go up and we were able to follow a couple of YouTube instruction videos with this kit and fix it.  It does not include a regulator so if you think it's just the wire that is broken it should work.  We were told it would cost over $400.00 by VW near our house and one mechanic said $1000.00. It does take time to get out back seat, side panel and window but worth the savings.
B00BTGSGFK|5|pleased with product
B00AIFZ4DU|4|i used this to extend connection to trolling motor. soldered and it will probably be ok. would not have ordered if i had read &#34;copper coated aluminum'.
B003VZJPU2|5|Excellent!  Roll Tide!!
B000EVWDU0|5|I bought this as a tester for the battery's charging system.  So far it works great.  The only problem I have with it is that the display stays lit all the time you have it plugged in.  I don't see any way of turning it off.
B00CD86IMQ|5|The part was as described.
B004VLHTSU|5|Exactly like OEM. Fit without any issues!<br /><br />Do make sure to pick up some silicone-based grease (super lube is great) or you'll find they squeak a bit. (unless you dont mind the squeaking lol)
B003S9RJ0O|5|Good quality fast shipping!
B00062ZQHE|5|Great price fast service awesome part, will buy again!!!
B001O2ZT90|3|Leaks from the seals in the tip after about 6 months of use in a heavy truck shop, clamps onto valve stem for hands free inflation maybe 15 times out of 100
B002P8UQWW|4|Definitely a little rattle at highway speeds as other reviews stated, but nothing too severe. It was very easy to install and only took about 10 minutes to remove the old mirror and pop this one in. Having the ability to add my existing color panel was very convenient, as this part wasn't damaged and could snap right in to avoid repainting anything! 5 stars if it didn't rattle so much. Worth the money, though!
B004ZF3Q98|5|the item was very easy to install, the hardest part which isn't their fault is the location of the old bulbs. They do a great job at night and very happy with my purchase.
B001GJ7A5W|5|perfect for a kayak but not for wider.
B004EK94P4|5|Have to order more, have already used them all.
B00T0WWZAW|5|great
B000EVYGZA|5|Great product for simple testing. Inexpensive but serves the purpose. I would recommend.
B00II99ORU|5|great product
B000CGFJPI|5|Perfect thanks
B001U60T9U|5|A+
B004GCVTOO|5|The mirror assembly was terrific and looks great.  Mounting it included removing the door panel, which I really didn't want to mess with.  Once I did the extra work to take the door apart, the wiring harness fits at that point.  Bottom line:  the product is great and works just fine.  The installation isn't the 15 minute operation I hoped it would be.
B00BMRRXSM|3|Very good to deal with seller.  However, the product is not very sturdy. I would spend more money & get something a little more durable.
B008GVBM70|4|I've had these lights for a little while, and they work great. There is, however, one problem, I would love it if the lights could remember the last show they were on, and go right to that when turned on, instead on having to cycle back through them.
B004306V2Y|4|Minus one star because they are not actually Sasquatch fur. But they work almost as good.
B00BTGSID0|5|Very satisfied with my purchase
B001DN1L6K|5|Just As Expected. Would Consider Buying A Back-Up
B002DZJQ0A|5|Nice product
B00HQT1W4Q|4|Look great on the truck!
B001UCGQ28|4|Excellent stopping power, still creates a dust like the semi metallic brakes, however it does clean off rims with greater ease. Simple dollar store degreasers are effective. Much less squealing also. Price was much better than any auto store, less than half.
B00GDHBN8M|4|Dry application leaves WAY too many bubbles to work out.
B00BSXHMA4|5|Did what it was meant to do
B00N18LXJ0|2|Don't waste your money. This didn't help at all. The product is very bulky on the visor. Best advice, invest in a good pair of sunglasses.
B008Y5A0IA|5|Was everything it detailed....Delivered faster than said...
B00E9D4NES|4|A little tricky to apply the front decal but looks great!!!
B0067ED2SK|5|there not cheap for what they are
B00E16LU7Q|5|Great battery.
B00P9OF04I|5|It works!  I was on the fence with this product - wondering if it would produce the results I was hoping for and it proved to be awesome!  Set includes 2 products to use - a cleaner lotion - and a clear aerosol spray.  Very easy to apply the cleaner first with the circular pad provided - it turns to a white haze frost look (like wax on a car)  then you wipe it off with a damp rag.  Then, the glass will look like it has a cloudy coating on it (this is when I started to worry)...but then, you give it a spray with the clear coat and voila!  Goodbye yellow headlights!  Hello clear beauties!  I have another car to try this on with badly yellowed headlights, so I will come back and provide before and after pics.  Also - instructions say to do this in the shade (which I did) and in non-windy conditions (which I had a bit of a breeze when spraying)...if you are worried about getting the clear spray on your car's paint, I would blue tape and paper around the light so the paint isn't sprayed.
B004OFLBSW|5|Shades have great coverage for my Toyota Highlander SUV.
B00JA80PEO|5|Very good bluetooth. My old intelphone only had 1 speaker and was $99 this has 2 speakers and u can actually hear the caller/music while riding. Great job
B0075JOXNY|3|One week old and already starting to rust.  Not too impressed with the paint job.  P.S.  I live in a semi arid part of Wyoming, rust is not usually a problem here.
B009EA9NJ6|5|These mirrors are a godsend! They installed in less than 10 minutes, and give me the vision of the the long trailer I tow regularly.
B0101M9X0O|5|Looks great...I had it on my car while driving in Portland, OR. I'm sure it irritated many liberals.
B000HT8I9O|2|At least the flange keeps me from smashing my hand like a normal impact driver, but it still doesn't work very well. Everything is sloppy.
B00M38VLW8|5|These blades worked perfectly, and installed them on my Chevy Volt with ease.
B00VCCTEPC|5|Love it!
B00GP7X6RG|1|I was only able to use 3 out the 5 led lights . The leds for the dome light and the map light are completely the wrong led.... not a happy customer!!
B00B90J9YI|4|Surprised by the good quality for such a cheap price. It DOES come with the drilling stencils. That only reason for 4 stars is that the hose for the set up broke during install, no big deal just paid $25 for a stronger hose to withstand engine heat and some more abuse. Was easy to install.
B00B9F0U5K|4|exactly as expected . arrived on time. worked and fit very well.
B004L2XHJ4|5|Worked as describe would get it again if I needed it.
B004Y9YIU6|3|excellent product.
B00QO1ENMA|5|ease of installing
B006U58KXI|5|These are really cute and very durable.
B000TYVU1U|5|Spark plug blew out of my Mercury Mountaineer. Kit worked great. My biggest challenge was finding a 17mm thin walled socket that would fit into the spark plug well. Could not find one anywhere for sale locally. Turned to a friend who had one. Unfortunately, it wasn't much thinner than the regular 17mm that I had. My friend said these three magic words: Grind it down! Yep...that's right. We used his grinder to grind down the outside of his 17mm socket to the point where it slid in and out of the spark plug well without any binding. Worked beautifully!!!<br /><br />I used his grinder to grind down my regular 17mm socket so that I will have it when the next spark plugs blows itself out. Plan to buy a couple of more kits thru amazon for future blow outs. Had to pay $59 locally. Would love to buy locally, but the price difference is too great.<br /><br />The only minor issue I have is that vehicle idles rough. I suspect that I should have used the shorter spring that came with the kit, rather that the longer spring that came with the coil pack that  was ruined when the spark plug blew out.
B007TYQ56S|5|Yes the part was what I needed and the instructions were great
B00A14QM52|5|Work great.
B000BV9MAC|5|love pooh
B001GC2LVM|5|These things are fantastic!  I like them far better for leveling side to side than the Linx Levelers (which I also own).  These are used every time to level side to side and I've relegated the Linx Levelers to stabilizing jacks only.  Simply back the trailer up 6&#34; to a foot farther than where you want the trailer, put these in front of the low side and pull forward until it's level.  (You could also back up on them) I just have the wife watch the level and I stop when she says stop.  Put the included chock under it and viola.  Perfect every time.  No backing off to re-stack boards or blocks.<br /><br />The only drawback I could dream up is if you were on really uneven ground or large rock.  They might not function properly or break.  Might want to lay a piece of plywood or a board down if the ground is really rough or muddy.  I would have the same comment for the Linx Levelers though.
B010W2R5SU|5|Perfect fit for 2012 Ford Focus hatchback.
B004VTF1B4|5|Look awesome and totally easy to install.
B00YFFPPGK|5|I loved it.  Had it on my car at a Cruz function in Arkansas and lots of people noticed it.
B005R12BK4|5|Cool grille emblem, perfect for the job we used it on!!! Will buy again!
B00LGZMEOS|5|Good as the OEM
B007TYEBSW|4|the foglight came very promptly and was new, but the lens section in the middle of the foglight was not matching the the foglight on my car and so had to send it back
B000ALIRRW|5|perfect, great fit at the right price
B000CO82CM|5|I was VERY hesitant to add this to my 08 4Runner however since I installed myself yesterday, I love the modification.  The 4Runner has a Resonator and a HUGE air filter box with a &#34;S&#34; shaped intake.  The K&N removes all of that and slaps a Conical Air Filter with a straight tube.  Amazing Sound, Horse Power gained and I am sure I will see a slight up tick in gas mileage (if I can keep my foot off the gas).
B004GE8O9K|3|Compared to the factory grille assembly the quality is visibly less.
B00GTXS16M|4|It works fine but there was NO WAY on this earth that a girl (who is fairly mechanically inclined) could install it w/o help. My mechanic put it on for me.
B00335HQPQ|5|Really enjoying these mats!
B00U6S1OMO|3|This is a temp replacement for my BMW R65LS motorcycle. I should have spent more money on another model. There is a lot of glar off the front of the curved glass. Just barely can see the numbers and I really don't need to be taking my eyes off the road that long. I am going to make a sun shade for it to cut down glare. A little slow loading up gps, but it is very accurate. No trip odometer either.
B001PYSU6Q|3|All was good until I got to the springs I have a 1964 Impala 4 door<br />My springs are different on my car so I ended using the old ones<br />The site said this kit fit my 64 impala so something went wrong<br />But its OK I made do
B00UG0ODZM|4|2 came in the mail. STOKED thought I was just getting one...
B00IY3YLCI|5|I mounted these on the front of my truck by mounting them to my deer bars (after market), and they're awesome at night. I use them exclusively on my farm at night, never on the road. In fact, I think flipping these on on the road or highway would be illegal, as they're THAT BRIGHT. Really, everything is illuminated with these lights on.<br /><br />Mounting them was very straight forward: they have a rocker assembly that you can mount first, before attaching the actual lights to the rocker assembly. The look and feel of these lights is completely black ops and rugged. They are filled with high-power LEDs, which is what makes them so incredibly bright.<br /><br />One final note: I've only run them with the truck running, now knowing exactly how much juice they're sucking out. As they're LED, it's probably not that much, but I haven't tried to kill the battery just yet.<br /><br />Having received these as a free sample, and agreeing to offer this objective and unbiased review, I can't see a single reason to deduct even one star from this review. They're that good.
B00EZUL6ZY|5|love love love my mats now my car is official yea buddy.
B000Q8GVPY|5|This tool worked great. It was very heavy duty, more than i expected. Lots of attachments for multiple pullys. Awesome tool.
B00603DSI2|2|I have a two door and it really isn't as good of a fit as they say. For the two door you have to cut holes out which are marked off but still isn't a snug fit. I also have best top trunk bags and this mat doesn't really work with them because it sticks up. I already took it out.
B0002V9IFU|5|I simply LOVE how this cleans and protects my seats.  It leaves a light lustre, not that fake shiny look that too many protectants leave behind.  I can even use it on the steering wheel, wipe off the excess, and not feel any film on my hands.  I've spilled a drink on the leather and this made it waterproof and easy to clean up.
B00T9U3YTQ|2|The item seems to be of reasonable quality although it is a little bit on the dorky if it meets regulation it's sits extremely high above the head and wears big for its size
B009S2V45G|5|this is grate product  and I do recommend it, it work same as original and less cost
B00UZYHQ8A|3|It fits perfectly but something seems to be loose as you can here vibration when the air is on
B007BKEVBG|5|excellent
B008KV9CYQ|5|Perfect fit ez install
B001GMTL2Y|5|Looks great. Fast delivery. Have not used yet but I am sure they will work. Thanks.
B002CGEKY2|1|False lug nuts were not described and would make the buyer have to change out 20 lug nuts standard instead of the raised crown ones that are original !
B00EPA7CZC|3|works fine except not as bright as i wished
B005CLMYOW|5|Easy install, cheap price, works like original.
B00U2SQ2D4|1|Not worth the time and bother of applying.  Got refund.
B008F91ME6|5|Using this on a houseboat instead of re-wiring the 12v system and very happy with the results. Gets the job done and mounting points were pretty straightforward.
B00DX8B3MK|5|Just like I ordered
B0020T17J2|5|It does the job, nice to have a couple extra stem valves
B00R4VIQAY|3|For the price, their fair.<br />...not stiff enough for me. So ill probably need sportier struts or tires
B002UJVNFA|3|Odd fit to my face.
B001B0VCBE|3|I was a little disappointed because I thought it would be longer. This brush is very god for the inside of the wheels. I wouldn't use it on the outer surface though.<br /><br />On the other hand a sponge can do everything this brush does.
B00VKRZQ4C|5|Perfect, exactly what I wanted!!
B0002MG5M8|5|Installed it in my Dometic fridge and no more &#34;Check&#34; light.  Very easy to install. This is the second RV with a Dometic refrigerator that I have had to replace the main board with a Dinosaur P-711.  Too bad Dometic can't make a reliable board!  They should use these as original equipment.
B008BLFHS0|5|Definitely needs the soapy water and blow dryer method to go on and stay on but looks great when done right.
B008Y3K9S8|5|2015 Frontier CC, Looks good, fits right, good instructions.
B001FEAYNI|5|Worked like a champ... cheaper then the dealership.... And I knew I should have ordered the others as they are all the same age... and 3 weeks later get the call from the kid at college... Dad the other window fell... lol
B001QFSSZW|5|excellent product fast delivery,really satisfied...
B001P2BBOQ|5|As describe
B00OMTAHYY|5|first pair was way off on design...but they got me new set right away and there worked great
B00EPROSES|5|These worked perfectly and were much less expensive than the auto parts stores I checked.
B00030D23O|5|If you need a big bag of nipples, you can't do better.
B0002SRL20|5|Finally, a home compressor tire inflator with gauge that works well!!! I have tried other models by other manufacturers with much larger gauges, but the chuck/connector to the valve stems were always clunky and hard to attach/detach without the aide of a third hand/arm. This model can be effectively wielded by homo sapiens and the gauge, while smaller than other designs, can be easily read. As with all other Milton products owned, this one's a keeper!
B007JEJQP0|5|its great
B0012GTVVA|5|Second camper I've owned and each had one of these installed by me.  Makes it so much easier to close the screen door.
B00526OP4E|4|I HAVE IT ON THE TRUCK NOW AND IT LOOKS GOOD. NOW TIME WILL TELL HOW GOOD THE PRODUCT WILL LOOK OVER TIME. WE WILL SEE.
B009OM0DC0|5|Does what I purchased it to do.
B00J7RB72M|5|I thought it was too small at first but when I got a lot of dvds and cds loaded, it looked fine.  Good quality.  Would advise anyone that it was a good buy.
B000IDYKQO|5|Compact and easy to carry.  Haven't had to use it but am confident it will work in an emergency.
B003RYOWH8|1|These seat covers are cheaply made and ill-fitting. I'm embarrassed about the way they make my beautiful new car look. I'll be buying something else as soon as possible, but they won't be from FH.
B004PX8BC2|5|great
B001GLOZ6M|5|Loved it! it was just what i wanted i will most likely be buying another soon.
B004RCQV8W|5|Great color and clarity, easy to install, fantastic build quality, and all at a great price.
B001F0G8DC|5|Thanks
B00SXAVWHE|5|thanks
B00ARYPQ30|5|Still trying to get ahold of the seller. One of the two led strips isn't working. I have one installed on my bike. Please get back to me!  Scratch that! Sellers sent a replacement asap. Works perfect! Looks sick on the bike. Pics up soon! Thanks!
B004AIDBZO|4|Working great .<br />Great service
B000EDST1U|5|Great for RV not heavy and very portable.
B00803BD8W|1|The tab broke while trying to attach them to the wheel. Returned the product.
B000HEBR3I|1|Didn't work at all.
B00VDQNELW|5|I wasn't sure if this would work, but thought I would give it a try. It definitely helps avoid that summertime forearm burn in my Jeep Wrangler. It's soft and comfortable. Fits well & easy to put on. I haven't washed it yet, but seems you could easily send it through the laundry.
B000A8OW9M|4|Replacement for my Honda powered power washer .......was exact replacement
B003L33KKK|5|I have been using Mobil 1 Extended Performance oil and Mobil 1 filters for as long as I can remember. After only hearing good things, I decided to test out Royal Purple.<br /><br />The filter fit my 2006 Pontiac Grand Prix very well. I can't talk much about how well it might do, but the build quality of the filter is far superior to any FRAM filters.<br /><br />I will update this review in 8,000 miles! CHEERS!
B003676LXE|4|Much better quality than from the discount stores
B009B9H112|5|Perfect fit and of high quality.  This will last as long as I own my vehicle.
B001PYCR1A|3|its ok ,it fit
B001FZL9ZO|3|Despite it's masculine look and name, this is actually a Chinese made piece of junk. What appears to be metal, is actually mostly plastic. I am slightly scared to stand on this thing. It looks good though. The silver part pictured is indeed metal, but most of the hitch component is plastic, as well as a portion of the underside of the silver part. The LED's are pretty dim as well.
B00AZ7WCUE|3|Have not installed yet, but are not in-channel window visor.  they mount to the outside of door.
B0047DGU82|3|I feel that these shocks are a lil weak for this car...still have to much bounce and sags in rear. they do work tho and are better than bad air shocks, 1 shock had an inner plastic piece in the middle of shock that covered the springs while the other didn't have it lol eh
B00F5MUB66|5|Makes showering in the RV with low pressure much more enjoyable.  The shut off valve still allows a trickle of water, but does help save hot water.
B00029WSYK|5|useful for RV
B005NJ2SHG|5|These bandannas are very nice.  They are much prettier than what you would find at the your average, brick and mortar retailer.
B001UHQXQ2|5|good stuff
B00N5UBQHS|5|Work great!
B0027VFZE6|1|I bought this jack ~3 years ago.  It completely failed a few months ago.  I realize it was out of warranty, but expectation is that it would last.  It was lifting the back end of a Bugeye Sprite, well within its performance limits (1.5 tons).  The entire car only weighs 1,600 lbs.  I was under the car and it  came down on its own, resting on the jack stands (thank goodness!).  A large puddle of oil formed under the jack.<br />Although it was out of warranty, I called the customer service department at Torin.  I let them know of the failure and asked if they were interested in getting the jack back for quality control purposes.  They only offered me repair kits.  I let them know I had no confidence in the product, repaired or otherwise.  I was told they would get back to me about returning the jack.  I wasn't asking for a refund.  There have been no return calls.<br />I called a second time.  My call went to voicemail where I explained the failure.  No return calls again.<br />I found the product to be dangerous and the manufacturer to be unconcerned with quality and customer concerns.
B00XZ9OLUS|5|works perfect
B00J00X3NW|4|The best Group III oil. I wish Mobil could stick to the original idea or making IV/V oils for the very demanding people. As far as I know, only 0w40 oil is better option, if 40 weight is allowed in your car. Can't beat the price with rebate, so great deal.
B00XUY97R0|5|Kit came with everything listed. Everything fit great! Truck feels new! Couldn't beat the price!
B00JQO0E1G|5|Great product!  Doesn't put holes in your pretty car.  Easy to put on and stays put.  Arrived quickly.
B00UZBWK8E|5|Great purchase
B0075SCD28|5|Very well made. Came with directions and a squeegee to get air bubbles out.
B000BVRZ74|1|It did not work as advertised.
B00PYIYU04|1|got 4 wasn't as expectex
B00I9H6K2S|5|Got here in a couple days. Plug and play!!!!
B0031B80FW|3|the picture and description shows bearings and seals but it only comes with the bearings NO seals.
B00534635Y|3|good
B00BAZC1SS|5|Got this in bout 2 days<br />Its a red but paler red.It works good.Radio comes in clear.
B003ZLVKXW|4|This product arrived as scheduled.  It took me and my son only 30 min to put it in following a Youtube video and it works great!
B006P1RKB0|1|After a year the dial is starting to fade from partial sunshine.
B0009V4GHI|5|We used this for a used 2002 Toyota Camry that had numerous dings on the front of the hood/grill and are pleased with it. It went on easily, taking about 15 minutes max. It fits snug, but I would suggest checking the straps under the hood that tighten it every now and then to make sure they have not stretched.<br /><br />The clips are plastic, but seem sturdy as do the stitching. Overall, this is a good value and should work fine for most situations.
B004Q86JJ8|5|I use this to keep my  full sized thundra charged.  I only drive it once a month or less sometimes and the battery was always dead.  Took it to a shop even to see if i had a drain, but it was just because of lack of use.  This  panel has solved the problem of a dead battery.  Works in winter as well as summer and after 6 months i have not had to jump or charge my battery yet.  It is big and takes up half the dash board, but it is what u need.  The smaller panels just don't collect enough juice, specially when they get old.
B00EDWF1BE|5|Look good and definitely keeps the hood from bouncing in the wind at high speeds
B002N2T3OM|5|Yes it is an expensive funnel, but it is admittedly nice.<br /><br />If you have an M car that requires 10W-60 and buy the large Liqui-Moly jugs this makes the initial pour much cleaner.
B000CSRA3K|5|Went on easily and the wrap-around design looks good.
B00HXC4JNC|5|They were good quality , but did not fit my bike.
B004SJUFH2|4|Good product. fit as expected
B004I723KG|5|I've had it on my motorcycle for a while now and it's done fine at maintaining the battery. No issues at all.
B0006SU3QW|5|Works as advertised.
B00E7BF6PC|3|good deal
B000FW7V50|4|Good product
B00V9WMCEK|5|So far so good still strong and no acid
B001TJ9IFO|5|Worked like a charm.<br />Only 1/2 a bottle renewed the Rhino Liner in my Ranchero
B00MWZCOSM|1|Reversed wires off position was on and on position was only the fan
B001QILZE0|4|Helmet was exactly as described. Shipped and delivered as expected.
B00N3OOQUK|3|Yah I liked it. I gave one to my mom and I kept the large one for when I travel on a plane.
B0009IQZH0|5|Awesome, Beautiful piece
B000CN7A9E|5|Need lots of greasing up for its a very nice replacement for the originals!
B001CA36VW|1|Does not fit 2012 Ford Escape.
B00DRB1SEG|5|Trunk handle fit perfectly. Wires were plenty long enough. You'll need to run them from the trunk to the radio head unit. You'll also need to use the VCDS from Ross-Tech to enable the camera. This is NOT a plug and play camera (none of them are). However, the VCDS cable and software are a great thing to have if you're even remotely handy and do ANY work on your own car. I also bought a set of trim removal tools. Made the install much easier, and didn't as much about scratching my interior. I bought these ones for $15:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LNBLTK?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage   The install directions weren't stellar, but good enough. The VCDS instructions were from an older version, but still worked. Some of the menus have been moved around.  All in all this was a great purchase. I looooove having a rear view camera. Makes parking in the city so much easier.
B00M9PDRY0|1|Works in my 2012 BMW X5 e70 but not in the 3 center console lights. Has a flickering issue. Not error free.
B004AJ9OYA|5|Great product, easy to install, arrived earlier than expected
B005M3BFAO|5|I bought this to cover my winch whole on my mopar bumper until I get a winch. It's amazing and looks very stock. I definitely recommend this.
B00KTJ0LRE|5|I was very satisfy with this product, easy to program too.
B0036E9VB6|5|This little puppy works great! Definitely as well as I could have expected. I would have liked a clip on nozzle instead of a screw on, but I will look for an adapter.
B002XQOOQA|5|Had to return it. No problem with the parts, they arrived quickly and were exactly as described, but I realized I ordered the wrong ones. Still the return was flawless as well, Nothing but praise for the entire process.
B001F1U5D0|4|Nice item.  Works in a pinch, and can even charge your electronics in emergencies with the usb slot.
B003HIJDD2|1|This did not fit my 05 f250 superduty, the maf sensor plug did not reach
B004BORKFY|4|I wish it was an API or Acea certified. It is not.
B003FO2O1G|5|Worked perfectly.  Pleased with product.
B002JBVPS4|2|One light mounting arm was broken but made it work with zip ties but did get fast delivery
B002YCE5V2|3|Mabe I just received a bad one. Service 4 wheel drive code came back about a few weeks after installing
B000630DDA|5|did well
B000C2UD4Y|5|What can you say. It's a Gates product. I have been using Gates products for over 40 years. I can't recall ever having a quality issue or problem with any of their products. Ask any mechanic who has been in the business for a long period of time, Gates Products has always equated to quality, and durability.
B0002SR7TC|1|Unit was bad out of the box. Instead of creating vacuum or pressure, it just hissed air out of the switch valve. Seems like that should have been obvious before it left the factory.
B00JN0U4SQ|3|Looks good. My tacomas stock antenna hits the roof of parking garages, so this does well. It doesn't get very good reception. However, I typically use blutooth for music. So it does what I need it to.
B0067ECOZW|5|Great brand and great filter!
B000YC6R5Q|5|Perfect Fit, Low Profile
B00J86N45K|5|excelente producto
B00MFZYUJU|5|Our race car this year was themed for Wounded Warrior Project and this sticker was the perfect added touch!  Love it!  And it arrived quickly!
B000BUQODG|5|Looks nice on the RV and was very easy to install.
B00IVA50K6|5|Superb.
B002Q1AHP4|5|Fills in scratches and minor imperfections as advertised. Its great!
B00BV20XF8|4|The BEST
B0042Z0E6E|5|We love this mat. We use it when we go camping and it adds so much charm. Receive so many compliments on it.
B0073UMCZQ|5|Easy install, works great.
B006LJ80C4|5|Fit perfectly for my car door,Thank you
B000AMXSUM|5|If your looking for cheap good lights I bought two for my 2000 jeep Cherokee sport and they work and are bright
B008BX8TU6|5|Great product
B00SVXS3A2|4|Bought these for my 2015 Polaris RZR Trail..  Works great would recommend...
B00ZQ79FUS|5|Great product. Thanks
B00FPTC7IY|5|Happy goat lover.
B00YFR875O|5|' ' Price Point: 5/5<br />' ' Quality/Durability: 5/5<br />' ' Need: 5/5<br />' ' Recommendation/Giftable Factor: 5/5<br />' ' Overall: 5/5<br />' 'Product Need:  Babys in the car, shower gift<br />' 'Pros: Good size, nice reflecting coat, strong magnet<br />' 'Cons: n/a<br />' 'My thoughts:  The classic baby on board warning sign is a great way to universally get peoples attention that you have a baby in the car with you. At 5 x 5 inches at can easily be seen from a distance. It has a nice glossy reflection coating to it similar to a bike safety item. It has a nice strong magnet grip with my car that I have no concerns with weather or other issues down the road. The 2 pack is convenient for each parents car. The only suggestion I would make is to have the ability to convert these to suction cup if the second car is not metal accessible. Otherwise the product is perfect. Please note I did receive a discount in exchange for my honest feedback that had no impact in my review or ratings.
B00PAL5ULI|2|I have no idea what's wrong but it doesn't work and fuel is not getting to the engine.
B001UC3C0M|5|I've had these suckers in for a year and a half now, 40,000 miles. Working perfect still.
B009E2RMWE|4|received as expected
B00KSZ5F5C|1|Absolutely terrible. Use heat to make it fit, hot sunny day makes it bubble back up.
B009FNX03W|5|Great looking running boards for my King Ranch. The bards and hardware were color coded for each side, simple installation.
B002UC1AKK|5|It it exactly what I was looking for. Fits perfectly and works well
B006X8CDZS|5|My Mazda CX-9 looks fantastic now :-)
B000CGVPBK|4|Good pedal feel, low dust.
B00MAG6RMM|5|Great lights bulbs.. fast shipping!
B0085YIC6W|4|Its very good. But not that dark black of the carpet.
B00TMUQE2W|2|Nice cover but Not waterproof
B002P8QWOS|1|The receptacle for mirror adjustment did not match the cable in my car. Mirror is useless
B00BTGDR9A|5|Awesome products
B000W0OFXG|5|Does what I purchased it to do.
B00EK5D562|4|Looks good.
B00MOKLRS8|5|Easy to install.  They look great on the truck.  Great price.
B000O1C47M|4|Arrived on time and intact. Used this to pull a vacuum on a car AC system. It works well and is quite. The need to change the oil each time it is used will add to the operating costs. Remember to order extra oil, it comes with just enough oil to fill it once.
B001KO4T5W|5|Nice product. Good fit. Used a dab of grease to hold in place during install
B002M6EE1G|5|Seemed to be of good quality as Moog typically is, but make sure to check the control arms before you order!  Someone had previously installed replacement control arms with non removable ball joints in my 2005 Chevy Aveo.  I ended up returning these ball joints and ordering the whole Dorman 520-161 and 520-161 control arms.  (Which ironically had the same non removable ball joints)
B007GSP2JS|5|worked great
B00CMR79H6|2|Does not stay in position in the back... slides around and curls up it's edges.
B0076YE4QO|4|had to silicone the bottom pads, keep them from coming off. thats it, they work
B0075XZ9HE|5|Good
B00P2D4BPK|4|Good replacement bulbs for my truck.  Don't seem much brighter than my old ones, but I can't complain for the price!
B00NFSNAS8|5|This product works great. Haven't had problems, and love the versatility with both input types. It works well with tires, sports balls, and inflatables. It took a bit of time to inflate a fairly large inflatable pool raft, but it definitely did the job. It's a little loud, but I don't mind since it does what it's supposed to do.
B001K69P8G|5|So as of Aug 18, 2015 I've had this sunshade for 2 years and it's still holding up! It's getting a little flimsy but in its current state it's still better than a brand new sunshade purchased from a retail store like Walmart/autozone. When I first bought it I didn't have to use my visors to hold it up and I still don't. I definitely will repurchase this for a different car as I'm on the search for a new one. You will NOT be dissatisfied!
B003ZWE6W8|5|Finally found these! Lol
B00GLSH6B6|5|awesome helmet
B00K56PR9S|5|love it
B00SV54LBK|3|First screen has broken links from manufacturer, Amazon was gracious to send out replacement, awaiting the outcome of second one.
B007KPJIRE|3|Great and as expected but $15 for clips? Crazy. This is a fault of bmw themselves though
B001OBGLL6|1|one of the caliper dust seals was bent and not installed properly because the caliper was damaged<br />again Made in China ,I should know better.
B000BUOSGG|5|Nice little dish drainer. Works great in our rv and is very good quality
B00BITHWYE|5|works fine
B009KP77WU|5|Hooked up easy.  If unsure etrailer.com has an install video.  It walks you right through it. Hardest part is finding places to tie the wire that runs to the battery.  With stow and go not a lot of places under van to hook to, but if you run down the drivers side of stow and go you will be fine. Just stay away from moving parts.
B00DZ54I7I|4|very nice and well made. Could use better anchoring. Seat portion slips around. A little pricey.
B00827AMME|5|Worked as describe would get it again if I needed it.
B003JC3UB2|2|This didn't work on our tank we were trying to repair. We cannot say it was the products fault, we might need to use it on something else, and would certainly try it again to see if it would work.
B000CPI5XW|5|Love this stuff... I use it in my track car... strongly recommend it!  This stuff is thick though so make sure and give it time to warm up!!!!
B00407RRGY|5|Matched perfectly to my car and was so very simple to use. It is great for small touch up jobs or to cover the bumps and bruises of driving.
B00HESFIJ4|5|Well made and works just like I needed.  Use it mostly for my trucks airbags and with the big dial it is easy to fill and bleed off to the desired pressure.  The bleed off button is a great idea.
B000GKD5NI|1|Glad this was a cheap add-on item through Amazon otherwise I would have returned it. It doesn't fit my rear windshield and even bending it causes it to fall constantly.
B000M5ZXIM|5|great for working under high trucks
B000C7QHLW|4|Great product, easy to install
B000C7S04Y|5|Never had a problem since installation with swapped motor. Buy it here instead of Auto Zone. You'll save some bucks.
B006LVLGLY|5|Air filter fitted properly with no problems and does what it should.  Inexpensive filter that should probably be replaced every 6 months to a year.  Figure - you should change your home air filter every month...  Why wouldn't you change this??
B004A2GOK4|5|Can't beat the price! Perfect fit replacement. Dealership wants $50 to change this for me. I don't think so!
B00REJXFM0|5|Easy installation
B00AQZB6MU|1|No Goodyear
B0068OZ25K|5|Works as advertised, watch a video of the process makes the instructions much clearer on how to program.
B00H6XPZN6|5|Works great and doesn't fall down like the other shades available. I love it!
B005H6W046|3|Looks good, but the description was a bit vague as after install, I realized that the beams only worked with the high beam setting on. Still trying to figure it out, but overall I can only compliment the look.
B000C59Z72|5|Bought these for my dad for Fathers Day at a fraction of what they would cost from the auto parts stores.  Just what he needed and I'm happy to get a deal!
B00G4BXCHW|4|Fits the truck good looks great, had to trim the clamps to make it work with the Toyota tie down system.
B00CWCDFKG|5|Improved my ride quality and handling immensely compared to my old struts with 160K miles on them. Was easy to put on the car just took a bit of time. Took it to a mechanic for an alignment and I asked for the report, everything was perfectly within OEM specifications.<br /><br />There is much less body roll, the car feels much more like it should. It also no longer bottoms out on every bump in the road, and it doesnt bounce on the highway. If I ever buy a car over 100K miles again, replacing the struts will always be in the plans. It is completely worth it!<br /><br />KYB makes the OEM struts for toyota, so these are pretty close. If I had to guess though these are closer to the Corolla S struts than the Corolla LE struts. But that will matter little to most people, they are just a tiny bit stiffer than the OEM LE/CE/VE struts.
B00MJ46WP2|3|It is a very nice car cover.  Unfortunately it did not fit a 2000 ford mustang as it was reported to.  I needed a cover asap....it fits if you put it on backwards.  This cover has mirror pockets which I wanted.  If you put it on so that your mirrors are in those pockets...its so tight it puts stress on the mirrors.  I flipped it around and it fits....the mirror pockets flap aimlessy in the wind because they are positioned at the qtr window...would have given it 5 stars had it fit correctly.
B0041MCLW8|5|bought this because it was cheap and was pleasantly suprised that it came with new bolts. I have purchased many gm wheel bearings of different quality and never had any come with new bolts.
B003LBQQQM|2|These u-bolts are plated and only 'equivalent' to a grade 5 bolt.<br />A plated grade 5 5/8&#34; bolt can only be torqued to 108# according to online resources, and when 150# is required to fully seat the springs onto their perch these simply would not work on a 1977 K20 pick-up truck.<br />They did not state the bolts were plated, just that they were an alloy, I do not recommend these to be used on-road unless your torque spec is 108# or less.
B00GSAUHB8|5|It fills up the full windshield whereas my previous sunshade didn't.  Also seems to be made of a pretty durable material and I think it will last a long time.
B00CZBQCR2|5|Work for the MacGyver in you
B008A8Z810|5|Looks very nice on the gas tank of my ride.
B00SCXCQV8|5|These lights are amazing, I installed some after market fog lamps on my 2014 Nissan Sentra and they didn't do the job so I saw these light on someone else's truck so I thought I would give them a try, they are SUPER bright, and they project light onto anywhere from the front of my car too the trees! I would highly reccomend this product to anyone
B00PRACZR4|5|Always skeptical of these miracle working gadgets on line, but this lift works exactly as advertised.  It's a one person job both on and off.  Total time ( if you are clumsy like me) about 20 minutes, less if you know the difference between a wrench and a screw driver ( I some times get confused.)  Lift installation takes longer and is a two person job.  Included DVD helps. Great product, happy with the purchase.
B000CGFW7I|5|Fit our 2001 Chevy Tahoe perfectly! Works great! Very Pleased!
B003A3GUEO|5|Works great so far. No need to buy one that cost several times more.
B000CQPU8Y|1|Product advertised it would fit my 2013 Altima sedan.  They do NOT. These brake pads actually are for the Altima COUPE. Even though the fault was not on my end, I still had to pay $$ to return the brake pads the sender.
B003PB9OSK|5|As good as the original
B00L6NTI58|5|shipped fast, product came with everything need to install it correctly. ive had other HID kits befor. this one is my new Fav. I ordered 8,000k in the 9006 hid bulb size thay are Very Nice brite blue. and fit into my housing perfect! just as I wanted! if useing in projector aftermarket housing you will prob need the H4 size bulb. unless your able to MOD from home as I can. Ive done this to all my kits tho this one in in OEM Housing and works Great. No Flash in lights, No flash from other drivers, No Cop Stops! peace.
B00DSD7LJY|4|Good size, big enough to be recognized.
B00QZHU2X2|2|Got here fast but, not the same shape as the picture. It's rectangle almost square 9&#34; x 11&#34;
B000FZVVR6|5|Sunshade fits my car well. Not quite the precision fit as the image shows here, but it goes around my rear-view mirror perfectly and covers the two small side windows on the door (which in the image are not covered yet let sunlight hit the dash). You will fumble with it the first few times you install it, but soon enough you can toss it up in seconds and get on with your day. Recommend this for anyone who lives in a city with brutal summers like I did (Memphis TN).
B00GUD0N4O|5|Great product. . Highly recommend
B00IX4CMM4|4|wanted just lights but these have american flags and are spots, easy to install and fit well. They OK.
B000CRO4OO|2|It has a malfunction- it will not exit from 'calibrate' mode without re-booting it (removing batteries), which eliminates the calibration it did.
B008CQFDCE|3|Not the same product as pictured 9 led 27W<br /> 6 led  18W light what was delivered<br />They appear to be built well and made a good replacement on my mower<br />still worked well for my application
B007DBM45S|5|Fun, my daughter love it!
B0093NAAY6|4|good stuff
