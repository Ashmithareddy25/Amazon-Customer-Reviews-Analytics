B00005JPBP|4|It has been a while since my group of friends walked out of the theater talking wildly about the movie we had just seen.  This is an exceptionally well written plot with many twists and turns.  As another reviewer commented, you do not want to miss on second of the movie.
B00ESY7QXI|5|Totally underrated, IMHO.  Yes, the Redford/Farrow was a more serious, &#34;scholarly&#34; interpretation.  This is a huge, gorgeous, Technicolor comic book rendering of the story that puts all writers to shame (since we know we can never top it)!  Baz Luhrmann was born to bring Gatsby to life. He &#34;gets out of the way&#34; of the prose by not taking it (or himself) too seriously, and by doing so, the weight of the words speak for themselves.  The &#34;Rhapsody in Blue&#34; sequence is nothing short of breathtaking.  YES it's over the top -- exactly how Gatsby would have wanted it.  Fitzgerald is smiling somewhere, I'm sure of it!

B005ZOBNOI|5|Being but a teenager, there were many words in this novel that I could not comprehend, but note  that what I did understand was the message John Green was trying to send. It was that we are all pointless,that we cannot hurt, nor help this universe. But the only thing that we can do is recognise it. We need to stop trying to make marks on the world, and start realizing what we can do. I would definitely read this book no matter your age, because the message it sends is universal. This book was truly an eye-opener. And I hope that it spoke to you as well

6304297912|2|Yes, it is a very well-done movie. It is one of extremes. If you can handle life in the low levels of the drug scene, then watch this one. If you prefer a more upbeat story, look elsewhere. I loved the Matrix, and  this is nothing like it. I give it a 2 for subject matter/content.
1439190275|5|Although the idea of indulging in bacon, red meat, eggs, full fat dairy and cheese, and forgoing the bran muffin, oatmeal and apple might seem like it goes against common wisdom, apparently that's because the common wisdom on diet is flat out wrong.  Throw away the food pyramid, the four food groups, the whole vegan/vegetarian thing, because the answer, boys and girls, is meat and fat.    Congratulations to everyone who dramatically improves their health with low carb -> this book is definitely going to help you along the way.

0452282152|2|I was embarrassed on behalf of Vermeer while reading this book. Definitely aimed at high-school level readers, who may be interested in the pseudo romance and &quot;artist as a flawed regular man&quot; approach. Chevalier's first novel, recently published, suffers from the same sophomoric skill level and just plain goofy storyline.
B0001ARCFA|5|The sound quality of these headphones is unbelievable. I was floored when I first heard them. The depth of bass I can achieve - while at the same time having crystal clear highs - is epic, to say the least.<br /><br />These headphones are also remarkably comfortable. I haven't worn them for an extended period of time yet, but I can imagine being able to wear them for hours. They're very light and easy on the ears.<br /><br />My one beef about these headphones is the cord. My old headphones had a spiral cord, so it wasn't nearly as long but still extended when I needed it to. These have a straight cord, which is a little cumbersome given the purpose for which I use these headphones. However, this is almost a non-issue - these headphones still deserve a solid 5 stars, and I can probably find a way to remedy the issue of the cord length (bundle up the excess cord with an elastic or something).<br /><br />I would highly recommend these to anyone who needs a pair of really good headphones for a relatively low price.

B0006IIPIK|5|One of the things I remember hearing about this movie before I saw it in the theaters was that it was all done with actors working in front of a blue screen. That little fact never really sunk in the entire time I was watching the film, not until I watched the \\"making of\\" documentary on the DVD. And now, I believe this is one of one of the most revolutionary, amazing films made.<br /><br />Sky Captain is a throw back to old adventure films of the 30's, a confident hero with a jaded past, a perfect reporter dying to get the scoop, a gum-popping best friend with a penchant for inventions, and a one-eyed general who's a tough dame. Set in New York City around the end of the 1930's, it's equally recognizable and not. A passenger blimp docks at the Empire State with a mysterious doctor on board, who summons Polly to a meeting at Radio City during a showing of the Wizard of Oz. She starts the mystery, only to be interrupted by flying machines attacking the Big Apple, which brings in our hero, and the adventure starts.<br /><br />There isn't a wasted moment or scene in this entire film. Trading character development for plot movement, the story treks along at breakneck speed, spinning a great yarn in the process. The acting, done in front of that blue screen, is phenomenal. Both Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow pull off the impossible, making us believe they are seeing what we are. Angelina Jolie plays her spoiler part well, offering a sultriness to a somewhat stern character. Another unsung actor hero is Giovanni Ribisi, playing best friend Dex, who truly embodies the innocent charm of movie characters of the 30's.<br /><br />However, all of this adds up to nothing if the visual effects weren't effective. And fortunately, they are not only effective, but they blow away the entire film. The look of this picture is unlike anything seen before, thanks to primary visionary Kerry Coran and his team of cohorts. Dark, sepia tones, magnificent special effects, incredible use of light and shadow all adds up to a visual feast never seen on cinema before.<br /><br />It astonishes me how the Oscars this year skipped over this film, maybe perhaps it will be recognized in its technical achievement. In the years to come, it will serve as a benchmark in movie making.and shadow all adds up to a visual feast never seen on cinema before.<br /><br />It astonishes me how the Oscars this year skipped over this film, maybe perhaps it will be recognized in its technical achievement.

B0089LOG02|5|A very touching and interesting book. I had not heard of the orphan trains before. So many displaced, and often abused, children all over the world. Not only from the orphan trains, but evacuation during the war, and children orphaned during those times in many countries. I am glad to hear a lot of these are being documented. I wish we could learn from these experiences so that children could be loved, well looked after and safe, but sadly, for many this is still just a dream.

What can I say I wanted to re-live that era of my life for a week, then I sold the CD to a re-sale record store.    Excellent just as I remembered, but since I overplayed it in my geeky youth, I felt no need to keep it around from fear that someone might think me a pot-head redneck midwest spaz.    Still, if yer into the Pink.... buy it.

B00N33OYPI|5|The technique described in this short book is nothing that will be new to you. Rather it is an identification of the relationship of conscious and unconscious practices that we all walk through on the journey of creating new ideas. Having these practices (or steps) identified and articulated as they are here serves the mind by giving an understanding or rubric that we may pursue these practices with greater intentionality. As I said, we already do them, but I would suspect we don't know that we do. Understanding the process of creating new ideas allows us to exercise and discipline ourselves to become better idea makers.

0517548232|5|Hazlitt wrote that \\"the whole of economics can be reduced to a single lesson, and that lesson can be reduced to a single sentence. The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups. Nine-tenths of the economic fallacies that are working such dreadful harm in the world today are the result of ignoring this lesson. Those fallacies all stem from one of two central fallacies, or both: (1) that of looking only at the immediate consequences of an act or proposal, and (2) that of looking at the consequences only for a particular group to the neglect of other groups.\\"<br /><br />Throughout his work, Hazlitt provides tremendous examples for each of the common myths of bad economists and politicians. The beauty of this work is that Hazlitt explains concepts and observations that appear to be complex in such simple terms that even the US Congress could understand, such as:<br /><br />\\"The world is full of so-called economists who in turn are full of schemes for getting something for nothing.  They tell us that the government can spend and spend without taxing at all; that is can continue to pile up debt without ever paying it off because `we owe it to ourselves' [but] ultimately every dollar of government spending must be raised through a dollar of taxation.\\"<br /><br />Other truths that Hazlitt espouses seem to be common sense, unless of course you are an elected official:<br />- \\"Taxation for public housing destroys as many jobs in other lines as it creates in housing.\\"<br />- \\"The government spenders forget that they are taking the money from A in order to pay it to B.\\"<br />- \\"Government lenders will take risks with other people's money (the taxpayers') that private lenders will not take with their own money.\\" (e.g. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac)<br />- (Government lenders) \\"will throw the available capital into bad or at best dubious projects.\\" [e.g. A.I.G. and the Wall Street bailouts]<br />- \\"If the loans we make to foreign countries to enable them to buy our goods are not repaid, then we are giving the goods away. A nation cannot grow rich by giving goods away. It can only make itself poorer,\\" and losses will be paid by increased taxes on everybody.<br /><br />Hazlitt provides a terrific example of economics using initially Robinson Crusoe, then Swiss Family Robinson, and finally modern society concluding that \\"everything, in short, is produced at the expense of forgoing something else.\\" He provides a detailed, yet concise explanation of the supply chain, subsidies, unions, price controls, and wages offering great clarity in this statement: \\"In an exchange economy everybody's money income is somebody else's cost. Every increase in hourly wages, unless or until compensated by an equal increase in hourly productivity, is an increase in costs of production.\\"<br /><br />One of the final sections of this book focuses on the dangers of inflation and the theory of the Keynesians, who have contributed so significantly to the current fiscal mess in Washington D.C. \\"The more sophisticated advocates of inflation, in brief, are disingenuous. They do not state their case with complete candor; and they end by deceiving even themselves. They begin to talk of paper money, like the more naive inflationists, as if it were itself a form of wealth that could be created at will on the printing press. They even solemnly discuss a \\"multiplier,\\" by which every dollar printed and spent by the government becomes magically the equivalent of several dollars added to the wealth of the country.\\" Yet the fictitious multiplier doesn't.  It is merely results in a larger debt that must be repaid through heavier taxes.  And continuous injections of new money lower the purchasing power of everyone. Sadly, Hazlitt's observation that government has nothing to give, without first taking it away from someoneelse, has not yet been learned by the American taxpayer.<br /><br />Hazlitt's writing on secondary consequences of fiscal decisions is brilliant and as applicable today as it was when first written.<br /><br />[[ASIN:143274917X Tea Party Revival: The Conscience of a Conservative Reborn:  The Tea Party Revolt Against Unconstrained Spending and Growth of the Federal Government]]Hazlitt's writing on secondary consequences of fiscal decisions is brilliant and as applicable today as it was when first written.

B0002Y69NG|5|The Matrix series wowed people with its special effects and action.  But what I picked up from these movies is a deep message.  Later on I researched what influenced the Matrix series and found out it tied in with Gnosticism (ancient christianity), buddhism, hinduism, and other philosophies/religions.      After you watch this movie check out the book The Secret History of the World by Laura Knight-Jadczyk.  This book goes deeper into the rabbit hole with all the mythology, religion, and science to the ideas that inspired the Matrix.    That is what I love about this series.  Many people disliked part 2 and 3, but they stood true to the original influences.
B002K0WBXW|5|The theme of Anne Fletcher's \\"The Proposal\\" doesn't break any new ground (another terrific film about a marriage 'of convenience' to stay in America was \\"Green Card\\", a few years back), but this 'take' has the benefit of two of the most attractive, likable stars around, Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, some genuinely witty dialogue, and the beautiful Boston North Shore (substituting for Sitka, Alaska). The result is a film that will leave you with a smile and a desire to cuddle, so watch it with someone you love!<br /><br />In a savvy modern gender reversal, Bullock is a brilliant, if ruthless Canadian book editor, and Reynolds is her long-suffering, but efficient secretary, forced into posing as 'engaged' when she is about to be deported. The pair so obviously are mismatched (by age...she is over a decade older...by temperment, and the fact they can't seem to agree on anything about their past), that the 'Elliot Ness' of Immigration (Denis O'Hare, in a funny turn), gives them just three days (spent at his family's home in Sitka, celebrating Granny's 90th birthday), before his interview will send Bullock back to Canada, and Reynolds to prison.<br /><br />In Sitka, the film really hits it's stride, as we are introduced to the fabulous Betty White (as a very spry nonogenarian) and her cute (and very put-upon) puppy, Craig T. Nelson and (a woefully underused) Mary Steenburgen as his parents, (woefully overused) Oscar Nu&ntilde;ez as the local 'jack-of-all-trades', and Malin Akerman as Reynolds' ex-girlfriend. While some situations are expected, under the circumstances (a shared bedroom and accidental nude...VERY nude...encounter, and a 'baby maker' quilt that always seems to be a prop in films involving ethnic cultures), we also get to really know the quiet Reynolds (who is a gifted writer struggling against a father who had already blueprinted his entire life), and the reason for Bullock's attitude (living on her own since a teen, and overachieving to compensate for a lack of love). While the frequent moments of slapstick are hilarious (the poor dog, a hungry eagle, and panic-stricken Bullock's stolen cellphone is a high point), the character development gives the film 'heart', and makes the growing affection between the pair not only believable, but something to cheer about.<br /><br />In this kind of film, you KNOW everything will turn out all right (what kind of date movie would it be, if it didn't?), but there are a few novel twists to keep things interesting!<br /><br />\\"The Proposal\\" is a winner!the frequent moments of slapstick are hilarious (the poor dog, a hungry eagle, and panic-stricken Bullock's stolen cellphone is a high point), the character development gives the film 'heart', and makes the growing affection between the pair not only believable, but something to cheer about.

B000Q9ISSQ|5|Fantastic read and the author has a great sense of humor
0786715103|5|The terrible truth about General Dellaire's book, \\"Shake Hands With The Devil\\" is that it is so well written it takes its place among the literary classics devoted to history such as Julius Caesar's Memoirs and Gibbon's Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire.  The General shows a profound awareness of literary tradition and wields it ruthelessly to expose the ruin at the heart of global humanity and how it lead to the  brutal rapes, mutilations and murders of almost a million human beings in the country of Rwanda. Corpses are piled everywhere and they fill the rivers and lakes of the country. The odor of death - perhaps the most diabolic odor in the world - is so strong and intense that the General feels it is impossible to physically move. The body of a boy trembles and the General trys to assist the lad but the body crumbles to pieces filled with worms and insects that had caused the flesh to quiver. <br />But there is something truly disquieting beneathe all of the evils and dark strategems described by the General. His book is essentially a work of atonement - but it goes furthur.  He contaminates us all with his atonement because almost all of us (myself especially) are guilty of the genocide. We did absolutely nothing while the political and economic alliances that seek to dominate our world handed the people of Rwanda over to unnatural horrors. <br />Those of us of rational age are guilty.  We must all follow in General Dellaires on-going work of expiation.

B0000004V2|5|Here's what I suggest, fast forward to 'I Am The Resurrection' and listen to the instrumental part from 3:50 to 8:12. There's a section where after a thick wall of guitar distortion, John Squire then kicks-in with very fast funky riffing. Once I heard this, it was a sheer epiphany, not only is 'I Am The Resurrection one of the greatest songs I ever heard, but it then led me to the rest of the songs where I realized that this is one of the most brilliant albums I've ever had graced my ears. Ian Brown, John Squire, Mani, and Reni. You will never get another band where each member excelled at each of their musical gifts/instruments. Resurrection. Revelation. Powerful. Pure Bliss. The ending of 'I Am The Resurrection' crescendos floating skyward, and how fitting is that...an album that soars far above the rest, a band who's legacy will be remembered, but disappearing into the sunset. The Stone Roses' debut rescued British music and is the diamond that continues to shine, symbolizing that yes, there is still hope. Discover this classic for yourself.

B0018OFN1S|5|Rest in peace, Paul Walker.<br /><br />You were taken from us too early. To those who knew you, you were a charismatic, down-to-earth, friendly guy; you made an indelible impression on those you met. To the millions who know you from movies, you were a cool, funny, intense actor with a winning smile.<br /><br />You may not have been the most versatile or talented of actors, but you were always the heart and soul of your movies. You were the emotional core of the Fast and Furious franchise, the everyman in Eight Below, the riveting protagonist of Running Scared.<br /><br />You gave to charity, you posed for pictures, you were a role model for fans. You were a great guy who never got caught up in the celebrity image. The action world will never be the same without you. Yours is a hole that can never be filled.<br /><br />We miss you, Paul. Our prayers to your wife and daughter.<br /><br />Paul Walker (1973 - 2013).

B001NHNG64|2|If you are fascinated by the mechanics of guns, and are fascinated how gravity and the wind move bullets a certain way (duh) then this book is for all you sniper wanna bees.  Add to that a big cheesy dose of a band of militia in the woods of Montana fighting against our own Rambo (Jack Reacher) and you have all the ingredients for your own private woody.  Seriously, the author does not develop his Reacher character at all in this followup novel to the first one.  The premise is lame, the writing is boring (count how many times a character &#34;shrugs&#34; in this book---worse than the last one...) and the ending is so quickly and neatly tied up you almost wonder if the author wrote the ending or his publisher.  It's made for TV.  There are parts in the book that are so impertinent to the story it's like a commercial interruption.  Alas, it has best seller written all over it, which tells you the real sad state of affairs in America...
B0000AQS0F|5|My headline sums it up on 2 levels ... when the geniuses at Fox scattered this show across timeslots, it was easy to miss.  Now that it's gone, it's also very easy to miss.  I don't write reviews lightly.  This was the most intelligent, best casted, humorous, compelling sci-fi series to come along in ages.  If you haven't seen it, all I can say is it's truly a treat.  Even my 55 year old mother, who pretty much hates most things sci-fi, found herself strangely intrigued with the cast, the sets, the laughs, and the dialogue.  This is soooo much more a TV treat than 95% of the garbage seen to fill up 800 cable channels, and 95% of the movie screens today.  Fox blew this one big time.  Even the subtle touches (no sound in space) are wonderful.  I would encourage you strongly to buy it.  I would encourage Joss and Universal even more to bring the rumored movie to life.

1594633665|5|This book made me not want to get drunk ever again.  Great read.
B008CLI4N4|5|definitely one of my top 5 tv shows and books series. i would recommend this show to  anybody.  .  .
020530902X|5|This book is about style of writing. You won't find ANY inane lifeless nonsense rules like &#34;don't split infinitives&#34; (a red herring itself). That said, I suppose another flattering review is superfluous -- Strunk would disapprove -- but this book's rating is a half star below five! I have been writing in one capacity or another my entire life and cannot think of a single volume as fundamentally influential as Strunk. I have had a copy since high school, though I couldn't tell you where it is now; not that it matters, I've committed it to heart. By providing the table of contents, Amazon[.com] has essentially given you the book save its illustrative examples -- that's how tight it is, and yes the examples are worth having. Perhaps the somewhat militant author could have slipped &#34;please&#34; in here or there, but that would violate rule 13, &#34;Omit needless words.&#34; Strunk doesn't want you to write better to please him, he saying if you're serious about your work you'll allow your assumptions to be challenged; and if you look closely you will recognize a compassion between the words, a committment to teach not browbeat. This book is nearly a century old and will be relevant in a century more, barring some sort of natural calamity, nuclear war, or extraterrestrial invasion. If you like, preview an old edition in the public domain at Bartleby.
B00EOFJAT4|5|This song is motivating when I am working out and I just love the beat.  If you need a good song on your sound track for working out I would recommend this one.  We do squats and lunges to it.
B00632HWOG|5|Easy to use &amp; does what I need. Great for quick check emailing. Great app for using on my Kindle Fire.
B00B8M4IMK|5|I use this charger in my car every day. Most chargers take forever to charge my iPhone because they supply 0.5A. Anker's car charger charges my iPhone quickly even while I use power hungry GPS apps. The device is well built and feels like it will last a very long time. I am very pleased with this purchase!
B0091REZMW|4|this  game keeps me occupied for hours.  i don't like how hard it is to earn diamonds, but still fun.
B007TNQ7EY|5|This Gangstar game is a lot better than the other ones. It looks more realistic than Miami Vindication and West Coast Hustle. However, it would be better if buildings rendered more farther away, and if the lag was a little more flattened. It still worked like a charm on my Kindle Fire 2nd G. Some people say this is a copy of GTA, but it isn't fully a copy. It has realistic indoor settings (clubs, safehouses), and you can do more than you can in GTA 3 or Vice city.
B00AIBZLVY|4|I thought this was a pretty good movie with lots of twists and turns. I was also impressed with the acting of the kids.
1597801585|4|Its very Gibson - lots of ideas thrown into a blender with a well-paced narrative.  The story opens quickly, advances throughout, and provides a good backstory on the main characters who interact to move the plot along. Some pieces are hard to piece together until the end, and some of the wrap-ups seem unsatisfying - how like real life.  But the concepts - Cheshires and Wind-Ups, a calorie based-post oil economy, and the Thailand setting make for a very interesting ride.  Enjoy!
B00TU9UO1W|5|This is the best film I&#34;'ve seen in years !!!!<br />(Finally a movie that's not a remake or comic books come to life)  Interstellar  does indeed tackle so many problems in the world and make you see them in a different way, yes really feel.<br />  Awesome special effects, but they all have great real looking special effects nowadays don't they.  (sometimes so over done you feel like your watching a computer) Interstellars effects perfectly help tell the story though. The research and study they did to make these effects credible with known science,  laws of physics, and hypothesis is totally awe inspiring though. Reminiscent  of Gene  Roddenbery's method in Star Trek. (except for the transporter LoL) Near the end though they perfectly blend the philosophy of science and religion .(how difficult is that to do do)<br />  I loved how they pulled it off though, and who knows it could be true . :)<br />  We now know that love is the much sought after Unification theory.  I loved that !!<br />  And it makes sense. Were stuck here.in linear time. If God sees all time as one event, and we are free of time when we die and live in eternity with our personalities and memories still surviving. Love would  indeed pierce through all dimensions and through all time.<br />  The relationship between the  Father and Daughter is so cool, and so important, I mean hell, they saved the WORLD .!!  )<br />  If you have a daughter definitely watch this movie with her, especially  if your a Dad ;-)<br /> After the theater when I rented the movie at the video store they gave me single frame of 70mm film from this movie (you know some piece of a print from the cutting room floor that they probably gave away thousands of) but I will treasure it for the rest of my life !!!!!!<br />  AWESOME MOVIE !! I LOVED IT !!!<br /><br />and I'm.not too easily impressed  ;)
B00A9T1HUO|5|Love is voice
B00JOT3HQ2|5|I love this game!! It is really fun to play, and it's fun having many options for design and things of that nature.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|I only need to say that this game has taken floppy turd to the next level. Great job guys 😃
B009GED3HS|4|This is a great show and this allows me to see it whenever and wherever I want.  Nice for a busy mom.
0060537639|1|I am Australian. I know something about Australia. My judgement of the rest of the book is based on what the author says about something I know. <br /> <br />The Author says the 15th Century Chinese could have called in south-western Australia (near modern Bunbury) for the fruit growing amply there. There was NO fruit there until planted after white settlement in 1829. <br /> <br />The book refers to the \\"Koala bears\\" abundant in south Western Australia. There are NO koalas in Western Australia. <br /> <br />Also to the populations of \\"Quokkas\\" (A type of wallaby) and fairy penguins allegedly abundant in south Western Australia. Quokkas are found on one or two small islands and in tiny pockets on the mainland. They are not abundant. <br /> <br />The book says modern Perth and Fremantle are seperated by the estuary of the Swan River. Fremantle is the port at the river's mouth and Perth the commercial capital about 10 miles up-river. They are no more seperated by the river than Richmond is seperated from Greenwich by the Thames. <br /> <br />Turning to the Eastern States, the book says there is a variety of valuable minerals at Newcastle, north of Sydney. The only such mineral at Newcastle is coal. <br /> <br />He also says there are diamond mines near Sydney. There are not. <br /> <br />Etc. <br /> <br />Etc. <br /> <br />If I find the parts of this book dealing with a subject I know something about to be absolute rubbish, it does not increase my condfience in the rest of - any of the rest of it. <br /> <br />Where was the publisher's fact-checker or copy-editor? <br /> <br />
B00933JL0A|4|I really enjoy completing building projects for my tiny townies, raising their happiness, their taxes... However, adds are constantly interrupting, and there always is a huge add in the top right corner. But, hey, it's a free way to pass the time.
B00AHSIQWE|5|I like the complex storylines and surprises of the Christopher Nolan movies. This one does not upset. I wish the Amazon rentals lasted more than 2 days because I felt rushed to watch this movie.
B003CH9PV8|1|Seriously. Amazon finds it wholey acceptable to show meth production, murder and a wide swath of crime, but no swearing. The show is fine but for Amazon to make such a perverse decision for their viewers is beyond comprehension. Are they saying so long as you clean up the language the show is suitable for kids or are they saying adults shouldn't have to listen to foul language while they enjoy a jaunt into methland? Weird and idiotic reasoning.
B002RI9S2Y|3|Was not a bad read. Our boys loved it. a bit predictable but enjoyable. whole family looking forward to the next one.
1608871088|5|The Rise of the Guardians was such a visually stunning movie, that I had to get the artbook.<br /><br />From the character design, to the backgrounds and setting, to storyboarding - it's incredible to see watch the process go from initial sketches to the final product.  There's great commentary, and beautiful artwork.  I especially liked to see how they utilized certain shapes in the characters' design, and with their coordinating &#34;home base.&#34;  Love the Tooth Fairy for her particular Asian influence!<br /><br />This book is a must-have if you have a collection of artbooks.  Another winner for Dreamworks!
0345803493|1|have i really spent money on this? I knew it was not Shakespeare, and I haven't prejudices against 'fashionable' novels, but is it so difficult to give a novel a PLOT, some decently rounded CHARACTERS and not to REPEAT the same pattern over and over?<br /><br />I had survived the first because it was about two people who want two utterly different things out of a relationship, so they had to negotiate them. There was the metaphor of the contract, that was -almost- interesting, and, like most of important negotiations, it failed miserably -even if for dumb reasons.<br /><br />But in Darker after the first 20 pages all this is over, and the two heroes spend the whole time biting their lips, telling the other not to bite their lips, pairing off, going about with silver balls in their body (she) and making scenes about a clearly harmless ex-submissive (he). I hate leaving things halfway but I don't have the courage to read the third.<br /><br />Two more things:<br />1- I am not from US and the idea that a foreigner get out of this book is that there the less you work and the more you are rich and successful. I mean, he spends all day mailing and stalking her; she gets a promotion after a week spent doing everything but working... No, don't worry, I don't think it's realistic!<br />2 - I am almost offended by the way Ana's eating disorders are represented, that is, as something 'classy' and somehow 'ladylike'. Not eating for 5 days and thinking 'oh, no, food' before dinner is called anorexia. It is not classy. It does not get you the favors of some kinky billionaire. So, just to make it clear.
B000089RVR|5|If you loved Dido's first CD as much as I did, then you will love her new one.  I find it hard to classify her music - it is romantic and introspective, relaxed without being boring or sappy.  It is true that the style is like &quot;No Angel&quot; - but what's wrong with that?  I think this CD is full of wonderful songs - all of them good.  My personal favorite is track 2 &quot;Stoned&quot;, but listen to the words on the title track &quot;Life for Rent&quot; - I thought the lyrics had a lot of truth in them.  This is a really cool CD, and I highly recommend it!
B00BSBR9N6|5|This book captures the amazing realities of human differences that makes us all unique. and it hysterically stereotypes the innocence and oftentimes regid lives of people on autism scale. Most importantly it is. about falling in love.
B006ID6NDQ|5|Really a good documentary of one Jew's survival through the hell on earth that<br />Hitler and his followers made.  I found the book very interesting.  It will long provoke thoughts of how could this happen.  Or, how can the horror be denied?
B000002AP1|5|This a one of a kind album. The RAW hard rock/punk played at high volumes is enough to make any fan of rock or punk satisfied. This is one of the best proto punk albums if not the best period. I love it, no matter how low you turn the volume its still loud and powerful. Iggy is and was one of the best performers and rockers alive!!
B00000K2SC|5|The Matrix is a fabulous movie. Not just anyone can appreciate the brilliance of this film so it is only for a certain audience. But to that audience it is one of the most intelligent and fascinating movie of all  time. Also, the soundtrack is equally as good.
B004J4WNL2|4|This book was engaging to read; I didn't have any trouble finishing it, not like some dry psych textbook.  But I kept hoping for a bit more &#34;self help&#34; advice.  If you are an introvert, it will just help you to &#34;know yourself&#34; a little better.<br /><br />If you are an extrovert, especially a manager, then you really need to read this book.
B009FZHYKU|5|Loved it! Season 3 was very entertaining. I was addicted all season. I think season 1 is still the best season but I was still entertained.
B00HV2KU5A|4|I don't enjoy the style of music, but it is very well done and engaging. My son (age 7) loves it, including the music.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|Awesome App!
B0050DIWFC|5|This author was right on about how school age kids can be savages, how screwed up the court systems are, how people can be fair weather friends.  Twist and turns through out the whole book with an ending that made my eyes open wide and say....\\"oh my gosh.  No!
B0002I831S|5|star trek the original series season 1 is one of the best season of a show I have ever seen I mean its fun it appropriate for kids its just a great show and the collectors packaging looks fantastic and will make a nice edditiion to NYBODYS DVD LIBRARY
B007GCY8FS|4|Like all the Jack Reacher novels, it has many twists and turns and it reads easily which I like a lot.
B0000636UN|3|Being a fan of Sheryl's music over the past several<br />collections, I was looking forward to some new music<br />from her. As 2001 came to a close and I started reading<br />more press, I read where she had been depressed because<br />she didn't know just where her music could fit in to<br />todays \\"pop\\" market. I then saw her in the magazine stands<br />showing alittle T & A and I was more than disheartened by<br />this \\"new\\" attidute of hers. Sure, she's a beautiful woman<br />in her early 40's but you can see that anywhere, anytime. I enjoy Sheryl for her contribution to music. I've listened to the new collection many times<br />and very few original ideas came out of this music. She's taking liberties with other musical licks, especially from the 70's great artists and trying for this new<br />breezie sound but to me shes fighting to stay young, she,<br />whos beautiful and talented just comes off cheap.  I have<br />always respected Sheryl Crow for her originality in lyrics<br />and music and saw her as fresh and able to ignite women's music<br />as rock radio has gone back to just showing off the big boys<br />music(sad state out there!)or the other option top 40. I agree there are several catchy numbers here but after you hear them enough, its enough. I guess<br />she needed another big hit like \\"All i want to do\\". I really<br />liked the song she had done after 9/11 on tv but she butchered<br />it on this new collection, I'm sure she'll come down off of her perch and give us some adult music we can sink our teeth into and<br />leave the bubblegum/T&A to the younger pop generation.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|This book was so well written.  It grabbed my attention from the very beginning. The way Liane Moriarty entwined three families was amazing..such a great read
B001TKD4ZI|4|Definitely a good read, though not quite as good as the Cat and Bones series. Either way, there were points where I found myself unable to put the book down. I will say however that it feels like the author could've gone just slightly further with the characters, but still a good story overall.
B000FC11A6|5|\\"Cryptonomicon\\" is long, very long but in that wonderful page turner way.<br /><br />It covers multiple decades and some terrific heros such as a marine, a Japanese warrior, and a computer genius. All are heroes in their own ways.<br /><br />I do not want to give too much away.  There's war in the Pacific and Europe and there's our current vulnerabity to computer hackers.  WikiLeaks did not exist when Cryptonomicon was written AFAIK but one can see a definite kinship with Julian Assange and the computer genuis character.<br /><br />Author Neal Stephenson has written a tale that is equally enjoyable by computer geeks and grandmothers.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I am still waiting for the movie version.  Richard Donner is the type of superman who could produce and direct it if his health is holding up in his octogenarian years.  Jsmes Cameron could also do a fantasitc job and would not even need 3D.
1594746788|5|Grandkids love looking for Momo.
B000002U82|5|Although I don't agree with those who say that this is the best album ever made, I do agree that it is a classic, essential five-star album.  It is rather more intellectual than emotional, it is very trippy, it blends blues/jazz with rock quite well, and, above all, it was produced with excellence.  The sound effects lead into the melodies successfully and significantly, and the album as a whole has a soothing, peaceful effect on me.  My favorite track is \\"Brain Damage\\", which actually I find a little unsettling, but perversely enjoyable.
B000001F2X|5|This one's defintitley a keeper. It'll surprise you again and again. JJ has paved a solid path for future groovesters to follow. I'll treasure it forever... it's a gem.
B0067Q42BY|5|Great graphics....colorful.....interesting tiles.....Really enjoying this app!  I highly recommend this game to everyone!  Worth every penny I paid!  Gotta have twenty words for a review.....phewww!
B001GCUO4S|4|nice
B003QCCS36|4|There aren't a lot of musicians better than Ray LaMontagne. This album is a pleasure from start to finish. Highly recommended.
B00NEJ7MMI|5|Happy with purchase
B00DJFIMW6|2|The update with the jelly labs is really not fun. I really don't like this update. You don't get to choose the world you want and just play freely. Please let us have the option to play the jelly labs or play without the labs.Besides that, good game.
B00PSID6ZK|5|Love the mini games within the game. It is also fun to collect and trade the cards! Fun! Fun! Fun!
B00NM7IR26|3|Predictable, did not like the &#34;other&#34; monster. I thought Godzilla's head was too small for his body!!
B003XTYDMQ|4|Good enough to watch the whole season. Actors were all good in each of their roles. Good entertainment for those of us who likes a series that has a little of everything in it.
B004Z2TUGE|1|You know how you can listen to the first 30 seconds of a new song and just know if you like it or not or if at least it is interesting enough to keep listening for a while?? Well could never get past \\"30 seconds\\" on this one. I have tried but just, absolutely, nothing pinged in me. See it got some great reviews so perhaps this movie was just not intended for me, whatever that means. I am a 66 year old male. So pay your money and take your chances. I did not like it.
B00CWY76CC|4|Over all I liked the game, there just isn't enough floors. If the game had lasted longer I would give 5 stars
B002FVHR5S|5|I LOVE this movie and it's a GREAT price!!!
B001KVZ6FW|5|Warm, wonderful, beautiful, allegorical, moving and heartfelt. Pixar do not seem to do run of the mill. Thank God they are not the child of their parent company!<br /><br />Up is fantastical tale of Carl Fredericksen, an old man with nothing left to lose letting go and following his childhood dream. Hitching a ride on Carls flying home is Russell, a young widerness explorer scout and together the mis-matched pair set off in the footsteps of Carls childhood hero, daredevil explorer Charles Muntz (wonderfully voiced by Christopher Plummer), to Paradise Falls in darkest South America.<br /><br />As with Wall-E, Up does not start like a kids movie, adults of an emotive disposition will be in tears within the first 10 minutes and most of the first quarter is scene setting, done, like Wall-E again, with a minimal amount of dialogue. Revealtions, when they come, will also mean more to an adult audience; the very real perception that we are all too busy chasing the dream to realise the dream is what we already have in everyone and everything around us; the moral that one should never meet ones heroes because even heroes are fallable. And, of course, for the kids, the triumph of good and friendship over evil.<br /><br />However, Up is a genuine family film. Pixar have really mastered the balance of enjoyment for all ages and the reward for the little ones to sit patiently through that first quarter is plenty of cute and comical once our heroes land in the jungle. Dug the clueless golden retriever and his pack, Squirrel! and Fred the bird are a joy. Not manic, or over the top, or Disney stupid but well rounded fall guys that you warm to immediately. Subsequent adventures may see septuagenarian Carl turn into some kind of Indiana Jones (the only incongruous note to the film considering his previous incapacitation) but Up is still head and shoulders above anything else produced outside of the Pixar stable. It is beautifully well observed and loaded with deft touches; the animation is, yet again, impeccable.<br /><br />So there are plenty of morals to be taught and lessons to be learnt and good will out etc. etc. But there's talking dogs (dozens more than Bolt (and a dozen times funnier!)), a flying house, a chocolate addicted bird and a crazy scientist explorer. The dark bits are not excessively so and many of the funny bits are laugh-out-loud funny. If it is perhaps, too plodding for younger audiences then that is to Pixars credit for not dumbing down and chasing the pandering parent pound. Up is another addition to their impressive catalogue of genuine family classics.<br /><br />Another great film, a film that's for life, not just the holiday season.peccable.

B005HE5J7I|2|Having read Rutherfurd's New York the novel and Paris the novel with great pleasure, I was looking forward to London.  As a fan of historical fiction and a New Yorker, I thoroughly enjoyed New York.  I also loved Paris.  However London was a disappointment.  As a school girl growing up in Canada when it was still part of the British empire and later the Britiish commonwealth, our history lessons on Great Britain were more detailed.  Perhaps I was expecting more from this book.  The Protestant Reformation changed the course of history, but too much of this book focused on religion and churches.

B0066WJLU6|5|I like it! It certainly brightens my darkest hours and warms my heart.  It just makes your flash turn on continuously on your camera phone, or you can switch the light source to use your touch screen as a white background. Pretty simple. I don't know why that's not a standard operating system function of all camera phones... should have been a &#34;No brainer&#34; for phone designers!  LOL
0375815252|1|After having read Charlie and Chocolate Factory after seeing the movie based upon it, I was happy to discover that there was a sequel.  I immediately checked this book from the library and started reading it right away.  Needless to say - I was very disappointed.<br />The plot of book is, truthfully and bluntly, quite stupid.  It was sequel made for the purpose of having sequel.  Don't waste your time reading this book.
B00JVZ0DQG|4|It's a fun farming game, however having to drag things somewhere to do anything is a bit tedious. And the amount of storage given per upgrade for the barn should be higher because I have frequently come to a stand still and not been able to do anything for a while due to lack of space. Overall a fun game, but could be better.
B004LWZW88|3|The idea of having a cute hero of a cat fighting and dancing so vigorously is awesome, but the story line sucks. It's predictable and put me and my husband to sleep.

B006LSZECO|5|Gone Girl is a great book - moves at exactly the right pace to keep one interested and engaged.  I genuinely wanted to know what had happened and found it difficult to put the book down.  I appreciated knowing how long it was, so I could judge how long it would take me to read it.
B003UMW68O|5|Imagine if there really WAS a monster living in every child's closet... and they had an excellent reason to be scary.<br /><br />And for anyone who has heard bumps in the night (adults or kids), \\"Monsters Inc\\" is a thoroughly delightful little animated movie that shows Pixar at its best. It has brilliant animation, delightful characters (\\"Mike Wazowski!\\"), and a really endearing storyline about a little kid who makes her way into the monster world.<br /><br />The monster metropolis of Monstropolis is powered by the screams of frightened children, which are gathered every night by specially-trained Scarers that pop out of closets. The top Scarer However, Monsters Inc. is suffering from a shortage, since kids are getting harder to scare.<br /><br />The top Scarer is James P. \\"Sully\\" Sullivan (who resembles The Beast with a bad blue dye job), accompanied by his talkative pal Mike Wazowski (who resembles a giant green grape with one big eyeball). But one night, Sully finds a child's door left activated on the scare floor... and while trying to hide from the treacherous Scarer Randall, he inadvertently lets a toddler into the monster world.<br /><br />Since children are considered to be toxic, the child (whom Sully named \\"Boo\\") causes a mass panic -- and somehow Sully and Mike have to find a way to return her to her own world without implicating themselves. But when Randall tries to strike a deal with Mike and Sully, the monster pals uncover a dangerous plot that could be deadly to both them... and Boo.<br /><br />Pixar has a way of making the weirdest plots seem natural and logical. Imagine a city populated by all sorts of weird creatures -- a jellyish creature that slips through a grate, a sluglike janitor who is constantly mopping his own slime, a giant chameleon, monster kids jumping rope with their playmate's long tongue, a Medusa-haired secretary, and the fuzzy-faced Adorable/Agreeable Snowman.<br /><br />The story is simple, quick-paced and full of physical comedy (mostly provided by Mike) and delightfully funny dialogue (\\"What happens when the whistle blows in five minutes?\\" \\"I get a time out?\\" \\"Everyone goes to LUNCH! Which means the scare floor will be....?\\" \\"... painted?\\"). There's a draggy section in the middle where Mike and Sully are racing around Monsters Inc., but the rest of the time it's a wild, funny little story (Sully having to sneak Boo into the bathroom).<br /><br />However, since this is Pixar, they manage to sneak some truly touching moments into the story -- Sully's paternal affection for Boo is really adorable, making it all the harder for him to think about sending her away. And Mike and Sully's relationship comes under stress because of it (\\"I am now stuck in this frozen WASTELAND!\\").<br /><br />John Goodman and Billy Crystal are simply PERFECT as Mike and Sully -- one is the enormous genial buddy-buddy, and the other is a shrill-voiced, high-strung little weirdo (\\"One of these days I am really... going to let you teach that guy a lesson!\\"). Steve Buscemi's Randall is deliciously bad (no misunderstandings or tragic backstory -- he's just bad. And Mary Gibbs (Boo), Jennifer Tilly and James Coburn all put out brilliant performances in their well-developed roles.<br /><br />It's whimsical, funny and a cute fantasy twist on the usual \\"working joe\\" environment -- \\"Monsters Inc\\" is one of those rare movies that the entire family (and not just the kids) can enjoy.y funny dialogue (\\"What happens when the whistle blows in five minutes?\\" \\"I get a time out?\\" \\"Everyone goes to LUNCH!

B00G3L6KQI|2|Just read the first book and the last 120 pages of third book, and you'll be good.
B001PPGAIA|5|Another wonderful movie that was overlooked and underrated.  Nicole Kidman showed a bit of a comedic side at times that was a refreshing surprise.  Of course the scenery goes without saying.  This movie touched just about all emotions.  Too bad it didn't play in theatres for a longer period of time, as it would be even more enjoyable to watch on the big screen.
B007THA4FI|3|I expected something great from this author,though the concept of focusing on one subject was interesting it became tiring. I would have preferred it in a shorter version.
B006LSZECO|5|Can't put it down. Many twists and turns. Love'd it.
B004P8JPS6|5|It was a book to find the truth.Not to believe all they say,but to find it and know that it was the truth
B000ZLFALI|5|This film is visually beautiful and the music is absolutely the best !! I bought the DVD as gifts  for my  grown kids and they love it as much as I did. What a terrific tribute to a time period that everyone -besides the obvious baby-boomers can enjoy.
B004A8ZWVK|5|thanks
B007EC27QM|5|I will keep this one. It is Very helpful when needed. Good at calculating. Anything it can do well. Thanks.
1451666179|5|This book was a nice read that you can knock out quickly. It seems about every other story is something that is not available on her website. I really enjoyed it and it's already made the rounds in my group of friends.
B00LTMIAF0|5|Supremely Human - Under the Skin reminds us that it is our emotional sensitivity, and the actions we take and don't take based upon that sensitivity, that crowns our humanity.  Here, a nonhuman creature engages in apparently malicious conduct toward humans, taking advantage of our all too human vulnerabilities, without a sprig of remorse.  However, the creature is not at all malicious; it is just not human, and thus, bears a void of human emotion precisely because of this.  As the film progresses, the creature begins to rapidly process human emotional intelligence. Witnessing its hastening demise on the horizon of its emotional aptitude, having never before suffered the tyranny of our emotion, is akin to witnessing a child experience the miserable and retched scouring of the familiar human touch.
B002TLSSXO|4|These are great!  Only reason I didn't give them five stars is they cannot be left in a hot pan.  I have gifted them to my Mom and she loved them too!
B0042RUMEQ|5|I'm loving this cd, my friend hook me into Nicki, now I find myself listening to her cd everyday. First were the mix cd's, now Pink Friday, I love all the songs on here. Good Job Nicki! You have another fan.
B003VS0CXS|5|Mine and my grandson's favorite movie to watch together.
B00OV4AOG6|3|A paid app that is basically a trial!!<br /><br />It allows you to translate roughly 24 images to text but at each translation it prompts to buy the full version for $5.99 at the time of this review.<br /><br />The translation feature does work (to an extent - after all it is google translate), but the fact that you need to pay for a trial is pure robbery. Make the lite version free so people can decide if they want to use the app and bring the full version of the app down in price IMHO.
0307592731|5|I really enjoyed this book. The last book I enjoyed this much was \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\". You do not need to be a hiker or outdoors person to understand and feel the rebirth of soul that occurred for the author while hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. A worthwhile read.
B001HBYHFA|4|Collectible
0345803485|1|Seriously the book was just crap. Not even worth wasting words on it.
B000FFJYCU|5|Grand Prix is a classic.  <br /> <br />Some people dismiss this movie as a good movie about great cars or about the technological advances the film made 40 years ago.  The true greatness of this movie is that it is a fantastic film about real car racing.  This film is a living/breathing entity.  The images are spectacular, yes, but the greatness is the story about real drivers and the lives they lead. <br /> <br />Saul Bass, the legendary Movie Titles genius puts Grand Prix as his all time favorite work.  And why?  Because even from the Titles, the movie breaths and lives.  The Titles run through the moments before the start of the Monaco Grand Prix.  The hearts beating up to the launch of the race.  The movie races at top speed from the very beginning. <br /> <br />More importantly is the question the movie raises about WHAT drives a human being to put his or her life on the line every time a driver fires up the engines of a race car.  The people in their lives who worry every second of every race.  Some who support the drivers only to take extreme joy in their ultimate failures. <br /> <br />Grand Prix is the ulitmate racing movie.
B00A3NQNUU|5|This is awesome

B0089LOG02|5|You will not be able to put down. I loved the way it was written, the story was so moving. Loved the characters, went to sleep at night thinking about them.
B004HGBUVG|5|Love all Lucinda stuff.
B00MRHANNI|5|I have liked 1-2 songs of Taylor's over the years, but she always came across as sweet, young, and innocent...which isn't bad, but more in the age range of 10-13 yr old. She seems to have progressed over the years, but her being the song writer/singer she is and being a teenager, a lot of her songs will depict her life as it is, which became annoying at times through the media. Plus she has come across as more of a country artist. I had heard about 1 or 2 songs that women my age (30's) were raving about. All I did was roll my eyes. How can Taylor be THAT good? So..I decided to listen to a few sample tracks from her new album. Wow. I was pretty blown away at how different this music was from anything she had ever done(esp. the country part) there were about 8-10 song that I liked on this album in particular(which is saying a lot since most albums on any artist it is 3-4 max) so I downloaded the ones I liked from this album and a few from the Red album so I could listen to them all on one disc :) BUT, after listening to the songs all the way through, I was even more blown away at the sophistication she shows in some of these songs and how she is showing great growth in her artistry and personal self coming through the songs. The songs, &#34;clean&#34; and &#34;this Love&#34; in particular are my favorites. It just pulls deep inside you and you really &#34;feel&#34; the song instead of just listening. I love, love, love the sounds in this album, it shows a very more mature side of Taylor which I am very happy to see. Not sure why some didn't like this album very much, a bit confused there, but we all have tastes and maybe some fans wanted to see her stick to the same old thing she has done. BUT when an artist takes a risk and steps out of their genre of music and come out successful...that is a sign of true talent and someone we can continue to see grow in the future! Way to go Taylor!! I'm so excited about the risks you took. Keep it coming!
B0063IH60K|5|Nice game and set up it also help me clear my mind free purchase can't complain amazon have great apps thanks
B00CWVGBEO|4|pretty good, better than i thought it would be
B000002VFW|5|I absolutely love this cd. It's one of my favorite that she made. I'm so glad I bought this cd, I listen to it over and over and never get tired of it! I recommend it highly!
B0014D6PCO|5|It is the closest version to the comics. A very good adaptation.<br />Good and recommended.<br />I've seen 2 times and see again.
B0076DCT2G|1|I am halfway through this book and am about ready to not read the second half---I usually love his books, but this one is sooooooooooooooo boring---I keep waiting for something to happen,but it just keeps plodding along---very disappointing---
B000LY5QQS|4|Not as good as \\"GOLDENEYE,\\" but Michelle Yeoh makes up for the lack of story. Great segment with remote controlled BMW.
B005NNUKF4|5|Again a great album screwed up to an extent by remastering
B004XJRQUQ|4|once you pick it up it is hard to put down, the movie was ok, but you miss so much by not reading the books
B009QU9X44|2|A very boring piece of fiction. Had expected a lot. Don't finish if you don't want to
6300184064|4|This remains one of my favorite movies, although most people I know don't like it. Terry Gilliam does a fantastic job of directing with this one, and all sorts of actors turn up in it - Robert DeNiro, Bob Hoskins, Ian Holm,  Michael Palin.<br />It is set in a dystopian future (&quot;somewhere at the  end of the 20th century&quot;) where bureaucracy rules the day. Sam Lowry  (Jonathan Pryce) is a latter-day Walter Mitty in this Orwellian world,  bumbling and daydreaming his way through life, until he discovers love,  which, in this society, gets him in all sorts of trouble.<br />I think the  movie is tracking Sam's mental breakdown, which is a likely consequence of  living in such a rotten world. The sets are incredible - claustrophobic,  filled with bizarre gadgets that are both modern and retro at the same  time. And several dream sequences are simply beautiful. The ugliness of the  real world contrasted with the beauty of Sam's inner world is bracing, just  as their inevitable collision is regrettable.<br />&quot;Brazil&quot; has a  very British sense of humor which may leave people scratching their heads,  but it makes me laugh even after I've seen it a bunch of times. One of my  favorite parts shows a dowdy receptionist using some kind of automated  typing prosthetic to take dictation of a torture session, dutifully taking  down every scream of the person in the other room, all the while with a  cheerful demeanor as she talks to Sam. Also, pay close attention to details  in this movie - especially the posters which appear throughout.<br />The movie  mocks and satirizes bureaucracy amid a society clearly coming apart at the  seams, and amid the satire and the comedic take on things, there lies a  sinister undercurrent. This is a world gone very wrong. You'll be singing  the title song long after you've seen it. The fade to white at the end is  interesting in itself - I keep wondering why Gilliam opted for that.
B0002O7XW2|5|our grandson asked for this movie for Christmas,  he watched it again as soon as he opened the present.
B0000E1WKE|5|even in 2003 she kept being the best. I can't forget her, now i realice she was unique in a lot of senses, and her voice filled me inside even in the last albums, so warm, so classy, she really had class to perform and make it hers completely. Please, Aretha, don't u dare......<br />KIM BURRELL & CELINE DION & USHER: I really liked the way they sang whitney's songs<br />IWALY because you're every woman, it's all in u
B005WUHAX8|3|4 of my brother in laws have a LifeProof and love it. They work well. However, buyer beware of purchasing one off of the web. I ordered one for me and one for my husband and both were bogus items. Were missing parts, didn't have seals, package had been opened and taped shut, etc. Only reason I'm rating the product is so people will be wary of who they get their case from. Otherwise the product is fantastic. Plus not bulky at all for being such an extreme case!
0385340567|1|I will never read another Child book. This idiocy and abrupt departure from a very successful francise has ruined it for me. The worst part is that this book is BORING.  Now that the Iraq war seems to be going well, I hope Child  is happy that his pathetic attempt to pander to the MoveOn group backfires and he becomes largely forgotten.
B000YHE4AG|5|This is my all time favorite movie
B000002BUY|5|I heard that Incubus was playing at a tiny little place in my home town from the guy I was dating at the time. We went. I was enthralled. I  couldn't keep my eyes off them! Not to mention their music. . . The next  day I went and bought SCIENCE. (It was the only good thing I took away from  that relationship.) Anyway, Incubus is just one of those bands that you  can't get out of your head. I like every song on SCIENCE. I love to listen  the different layers of different kinds of music and try to pick them  apart, and on this CD they go together so well I'll be listening for years.  I'd recommend this CD to anyone who likes Faith No More, for one thing, and  also to anyone who likes music that is put together very well, played live  in god-like manner, and with an excellent blend of lyric and notes. It's a  treasure I'm glad to have found!
1612930425|5|Blame Jane - Austen that is - for The Marriage Plot: the idea that a woman's ambition and happiness rests solely upon marriage to a man; and that she is free to use any means to land her man, including to a great degree: gossip, deceit, and deception. In addition, she need not worry that he is not the ideal man, for she can mold him into what it is she wants because he is witless--putty in her hands. Unless he is a scoundrel, who turns the plot upside down on an unsuspecting nubile. Cheers, Mr. Wickham.<br /><br />Nora Roberts owes Austen for her fortune and success. Austen was the pioneer that many other romance writers have followed. Not only writers, but including real girls and women for, apparently, centuries, right on up to today; and is responsible for much of marriage's misery (sometimes for some people.) For some, I know, The Marriage Plot works.<br /><br />Jane Austen was a young, little (Actually, I don't know if she was little or what she looked like - but I do know she had one fine imagination.) twerp--writing wishful fantasies in her attic about things she had little experience with, having never been married, or `properly in love,' or, \\"`violently in love.\\"' Thank goodness she didn't write sex scenes.<br /><br />Oh Miss Bennet, no not you Jane, or you Mary, or her niece, or the other sister, or her cousin, or his cousin - yes, you Elizabeth, the creature that is Mr. Bennet's daughter, or should I call you Lizzy? Eliza? The writing is often confusing and redundant and nothing happens but gossip and sideways conversations - which is probably accurate for the times. It certainly is today. So there is that. If Austen were alive today she might be a stand-up comic. She's funny, and if you can muddle through the bad writing - amusing and entertaining. I struggled to finish the book, but then I'm not a fan of The Marriage Plot nor bad writing. Nevertheless - five stars because she was way ahead of her time - a true pioneer.
B00004STPT|5|This CD is amazingly beautiful. I love the theme song and that was the main reason I bought the CD, but the whole disc is wonderful! Hans Zimmer has donw an excellent job,as always. Don't waste any time, if you love movie soundtracks, go buy this now. You will not regret it at all!
B00QW8TYWO|4|Very addictive game, reminds me of Frogger (back in the days) but this game gives you coins and upgrades.  Con is you get ads and asks you to buy things from time to time.

B000QRIGLC|4|Great book. Made me cry a little too much. You should get the book. The last 200 pages I couldn't put it down. I've always had a deep respect for my countries army,navy, marines and air force but somehow after reading this I have  even more.
B003U0AHBO|5|Very well done. Liked it so much better than I thought I would. Superior to all other Robin Hood productions I have seen. Destined to become a classic.
B00JRAYXIE|4|I really enjoyed this game. I gave it 4 stars only because the HOG's were a little bit to busy. Overall the game was great. Will enjoy lots more games like this. I would definitely recommend it to my friends.

B004MPEFBE|5|so good
B005ZOBNOI|5|I will try not to spoil this book but I will tell you, after reading it I cried for two hours pondering my life and the universe. I would probably reread this book several times and each time learn more and probably cry more. Okay, okay (you'll see what I did there) I would recommend this book to anyone that questions life, death, or human existence or anyone who enjoys a great love story, whichever person you are, you may possibly become the other types also after reading this book. That's the thing about pain (and the universe) it demands to be felt.
B00BESJYAY|5|Better than all this blood and guts sensless killing movies.Great story,adventure,morales,and determination to overcome life obstacles and follow your dreams.
B000GIXEIG|4|\\"Beowulf and Grendel\\" is a descent re-telling of the epic poem \\"Beowulf,\\" the oldest poem written in the English language. While it isn't the best film ever made, it has an interesting premise: Grendel, a giant human, attempts to avenge the death of his father at the hands of King Hrothgar and his men, while the Geat warrior Beowulf comes to Hrothgar's kingdom to hunt him down. Gerard Butler is in top form as Beowulf, and Sarah Polley is beautiful in her role as a witch, while Hringur Ingvarsson gives us a Grendel who is not evil, but a man who seeks to kill the men who killed his father, who loved him deeply. In this film, the viewer will feel more inclined to cheer for Grendel than Beowulf, and that is to be expected.<br />The problems with the film stem from the choppy editing, which could confuse the viewer if he doesn't pay attention all the way through. Also, with the dialects in the film, viewers might find a hard time understanding what some of the characters are saying. There is also a limited amount of action in the film, so some will find the film dull.<br />Overall, this is an O.K. rendering of the heroic story to the screen. It's a good movie for everyone to view once.<br />Movie/DVD Grade: B-
B004TTMYQG|5|I'll preface this review by saying that i've used calendargoo and touch calendar extensively. I thought calengoo's drag & drop style abilities were awesome, this is just in a whole new league.<br /><br />Business calendar is still being very actively developed, which is always a great thing. If you're going to pay for this, it's nice to know things will be fixed as well as added. 12 widgets, covering every size, and type. Easy to add event's, even straight from the widget. Can drag & drop, schedule reoccurring events, and it does a fantastic job syncing all my calendars with zero work from me. Widgets and app look good. This just plain works well, i'd urge everyone to DL this today. If you miss out on it for free, and need a solid calendar app. This is hands-down the android calendar app i'd recommend.<br /><br />Phone: Droid X(Android 2.2.1, Liberty 2.0.1)
B0086700CM|5|Excellent product! Perfect for my phone. Works, Free product when ordering the new phones, all I got to say about it..
B0067Q42BY|5|one of the best Mahjong games I've seen and played in a long time. I bought it as FAOTD so ads on 1st screen don't bother me; if I had paid $5.00 for this app, the ads would have brought my rating down to four stars... I just think developers would've been smarter to have a button option to go find other games by G5 rather than force thrum it when you've paid for an app.  That said, the graphics are beautiful, gameplay is smooth and challenging without being impossible. The adventure comic strip isn't adding much to the game but doesn't take anything away either. it reminds me of the old soap opera detective comic strips from the funny pages... not funny, never actually completes a story, but you read it anyway.  absolutely worth a free download, and if you like mahjong, it's a beautifully done paid app.
B009R659L8|5|I have read all of Mary Higgins Clark's books...and this one is at the top of her all time best reads...a real page turner from the get go...the ending was thrilling!!!

140053271X|5|When I got the &#34;new&#34; eBook, I was originally skeptical as packaging had abviously been opened prior.  But everything was in the box that was supposed to be and I did not see any signs of previous use on the item.  It is up and running so all is well.  I was hesitant to purchase through an off-site provider, but it was delivered quickly and in great working order.
B00BAXFECK|5|One of my all time favorite novel, because it dares to ask the important questions about life . Art plays a big part in my life so I could appreciate the role it plays here and how it can affect people different ways. Not for the faint of heart, our hero goes through many experiences that are rough , but emerges triumphant . Thats all I hold give away.<br />If you have ever stood before a painting and felt your heart stir, or something deeper. Sometimes it is an emotion more primal that can bring tears to your eyes, because you can feel the pain the artist is trying to convey. If art can speak to you like this, then you will understand  Goldfinch and why Theo says .....Between &#34;reality&#34; on the one hand and and the point where the mind strike reality, there is a middle zone, a rainbow edge where beauty comes into being , where two very different surfaces mingle and blur and provide what life does not: and this is the space where all art exists, and all magic<br /><br />With writing like this, it is no surprise that this won the Man Booker Award.
B0036S4B6M|5|I really enjoyed reading this book.  The perspective was very different than I was expecting and thus changed my perspective about prison.  Isn't that the hope of any author?  I would highly recommend this book.
0345803507|5|This book is one of the best books I have ever read.. You can just read them over and over again and continue to fall in love with this story and Christian Grey :)

0553296981|5|The basic outline of Anne Frank's story is well-known.  A young Jewish girl was forced to go into hiding with her family and others during WWII in occupied Amsterdam.  After two years of concealment, they were betrayed to the Nazis.  Anne died in the concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen before her 16th birthday.  She is generally seen as a figure of pity.<br /><br />This was one of those books that I always meant to read and now, having finally gotten around to it, I find myself privileged to have met such an extraordinary person.  After such intimate contact with her most private thoughts, it really begins to feel that she someone with whom I have spent some time.  Anne was a talented writer, even at the ages of 13-15, and her diary presents a full portrait of a complex human being, not merely a noble sufferer.  The nobility is certainly there, especially in the later entries, but so is the peevishness and self-centeredness of the teenage years.  She presents her inner world so clearly that it becomes plain that the world lost a great voice and perhaps a great author when the Nazis murdered her.  This document is one of the greatest indictments of the Holocaust.
B002MQYOFW|5|Amazing book, would not even begin to classify as a &#34;teen&#34; book. Even better then the movie, you get sucked in.
B00LTMIAF0|5|Great.  Not a body-double either!

B0001NBMBC|4|This CD sounds just like Iowa..with about 4-5 softer songs..How can fans of Slipknot say that their band went soft? I just listened to the CD and every song sounds like ones from Iowa,and some of the music sounds like from their debut album \\"slipknot\\".That hard more ofa hip-hip feel to it.and iowa was more rock.This combines part stone sour/slipknot/iowa...And Corey can actually be understood..if you want music where all you hear is screaming,then listen to the first two slipknot albums(mainly the first)At least on Iowa he tried to actually show some talent..how much talent is there in Screaming? Not much..yeah,if you are singing and then scream,then fine..but to just scream for 5 minutes straight,no...sorry...thats called a cheap way to make money off 13 year olds who dont know what real music is.this CD is jus tlike their others,but with better vocals.It is still hard,dont listen to ppl who are saying Slipknot went soft.just a few songs are soft(Stone Sour type stuff) And why did they put that stuff on here? Probaly because they realized that Stone Sour as a band makes better music that appeals to everyone.Slipknot is just as hard on this album,so if you liked the first two,you will like this..But thats only if you can get over the fact that Corey does not Yell every single song..oh what a shame,i dont have to listen to some guy in a mask yell for an hour or more,thats ashame .This cd actually shows that these guys have some talent in them.I likeda few songs on their past CDS(wait and bleed,heretic anthem,Left Behind,My plague) because you could understand what he was saying...and its true,there are 9 members but on this CD you cant tell that..thats the only downfall here.On the other cds it sounded chaotic with 9 people,here it is more organized..and it is more organized cause they worked with Rick Rubin(best producer ever)RHCP,Jay-z /every other good CD that has came out in the past 10 years he has produced basicaly.he does rapandrock and anything.and he made Slipknot show their best side,the REAL msic side.Long live slipknot!!! P.s. The song Duality sounds alot like other Slipknot songs of the past,so what are ppl saying it sounds like Disco ? Its got an awesome beat to it and Corey is talking in a low voice and it sounds MENACING.thats the only word to describe it..Dark and MENACING.Awesome CD for real Music lovers of any kind!!!
B0064X7FVE|4|Seems pretty accurate for my area.  It works good for me, I like it. I would recommend it as a good down load application.
B009NY43NY|5|Love it so sad it's over<br />Loved the whole entire series of books....very easy read and keeps your attention, keep  you wanting more
B004U8VUUC|4|I listened to most of the book as my wife read it.  The rest I read by myself.  I would promote this to people who are looking for a good ending.
B002BKIERI|4|My motivation for getting LD was after having heard Snatam Kaur perform two of the selections from the recording at a concert (I didn't know they were from that CD - I was listening to the music for the first time.) I was immediately and deeply moved by them.    Every recording contains particular songs that \\"grab\\" us, that we just \\"have to have.\\" The two that knocked me over upon first hearing were \\"Pritham Bhagaautee\\" and \\"Ardas Bhayee.\\" The former is so full of joy, it infuses the listener with overflowing happiness and ecstasy. The latter reminded me of the melodic structure of the Pachelbel Cannon - it's very sweet, heartfelt, and touching - and easy to sing along to!    I imagine I will never ever get tired of listening to those two songs and to be touched in a soulful way.    I wanted to say, that like all of the recordings I have heard by SK, including the recording from a live performance, this package is put together very professionally. The recording is tight, the sound engineering is excellent as are the inner liner notes which contains a stylish cover, done in the script, I suppose of Gurmukhi, and all lyrics are not only provided, but translated into English. The use of vocal dubbing of Snatam's voice is exquisite (check out the higher notes she hits in \\"Servant of Peace\\").    Lots of interesting instruments used in this recording, including the use of the cello, esraj, santoor, and sarod, just to mention a few. The use of the esraj, I think, is the one which is used to create a haunting mournful sound throughout many of the selections. (Listen to all the instruments used in \\"Pritham Bhagaautee!\\" The way they are used creates an ecstatic effect! This song is one in which the use of traditional drums, or at least the use of the cymbals, is put to excellent effect, a percussion sound that would not be captured by the use of the tabla alone.)    The performance and combination of musicians and instrumentation is excellent. This recording contains a variety of styles, ranging from slow hymns sung in both English and Gurmukhi, to the more upbeat ones. \\"Liberation's Door\\" rocks (as does a section of \\"Servant of Peace\\")!     I was surprised to read on the inner booklet back cover that one of the listed instruments was \\"drums and percussion.\\" At times, the more contemporary use of drums can be heard. I mention this, because I am more used to hearing the use of the tabla for this kind of genre, and the use of the drums makes for more of a secular/popular treatment, particularly during a segment of \\"Servant of Peace,\\" where the style turns this piece from a more traditional chant to what sounds like a more contemporary pop-style music. (This is the first song on the recording and I was concerned that the whole recording was going to be in this style - fortunately, it is limited to just one portion of this song. When I put this in context of this selection and the other songs on the recording, the more contemporary/Western pop style of drum is tolerable. I listen to the music of SK to tap into the more traditional sound of chanting, not for a more contemporary airing - occassional veering off is ok for me, and she does a good job of combining the \\"sacred\\" with the \\"secular.\\" \\"Servant of Peace\\" is a good example of how she has combined both genres into an uplifting song. Note my later comment about the use of drums in \\"Pritham Bhagaautee.\\")    The inclusion of lyrics in the small pamphlet that comes with the package (no jewel case for this CD and booklet,) is important, because it allows you to follow along as SK sings and understand the meaning of the words. Hearing her pronounce the words helps with understanding how they should be sung. (Given the excellence of the entire production and packaging of this product, I was surprised to note a few misspellings of simple English words in the provided lyric booklet.)    To my ear, all the selections on this CD are enjoyable, some much more than others. I've mentioned my two favorites by far.    I prefer to hear SK's voice as the primary voice and a male voice(s) as backup. On the cuts \\"Servant of Peace,\\" \\"Liberation's Door,\\" and \\"Mother's Blessing,\\" the sound of Manish Vyas's voice alternates with SK's. His vocal quality is quite different from that of SK. Some people may like it. When I first heard it, it added to the more \\"authentic\\" sacred nature of the chanting, and after awhile, I preferred for the voice to be used more in the background. Just a small quibble!    When I first read the lyrics to the first selection, \\"Servant of Peace,\\" I was disappointed that so much of it was in English, but in fact, the singing time seems equally devoted to singing the song in Gurmukhi, followed by the St. Francis of Assisi English words, and the presence of both languages serves the way in which this song is delivered. The use of both languages made the song more interesting. I imagine how it would have been been sung in just Gurmukhi, or English, and both would have been fine, too!    I wanted to add that the very interesting thing about \\"Servant of Peace\\" (don't read this if you want to be surprised by your first hearing of this piece!) is that it starts out as a traditional formal chant, then switches over to English chanting in a more contemporary musical style, and then opens up to a joyous melodic outpouring, closing with a quiet finish.    There is a beautiful inclusion of some Enya-sounding vocal overdubbing of choral voices at the end of \\"Crimson\\" which adds to the beauty of its rendition.    Most of the rest of the music is sung in Gurmukhi, with the exception of \\"Mother's Blessing\\" which is sung in English and Spanish.    All words to the songs on this recording are beautiful and heartfelt. I gave this recording a 4, rather than a 5, due to my subjective reaction to the melodies of a few selections - while they were pleasant (\\"Mother's Blessing\\"), they didn't strike me as having the same degree of colorful interest as some of her other music (highly subjective of course - I know some people \\"love\\" the song \\"Mother's Blessing.\\" Lyrically, it is beautiful. Melodically, it didn't grab me that much.)    SK fans will love this recording and I imagine each will have his/her own favorites on it due to the wide variety of musical styles.    \\"Har Har Ram Das Guru Hai\\" will have you singing along. Great instrumentation, great vocals, and blissful choral vocal overdubbing of SK's voice.    This recording can be listened to in various modes - as pleasant background music, contemporary pop music, and for the more contemplative and ecstatic effect.     Upon third listening (as background music), I am enjoying the cut \\"LD\\" and more.  I also noticed the presence of more jazz stylings than I can recall on any other song I have heard by her. Also noticed some interesting multiple vocal overdubbings of her voice. Performances are really well done. Come to think of it, some of the other cuts on this recording sound more enjoyable (like \\"Har Har Ram Das Guru Hai\\"). \\"Charan Sat Sat\\" is one of the more simpler sounding chants - pleasant on the level it is delivered.    For all SK fans, if you have not heard \\"Servant of Peace,\\" \\"Pritham Bhagaautee,\\" and/or \\"Ardas Bhayee,\\" you will be reminded why you love this musician so much. The last two songs, in particular are SO SO special, it reminded me of the huge difference that sacred music has over some secular music that is written from a different source of inspiration in affecting one's ability to connect to that inner holy source.
B002RVCD6O|3|The movie was very dark, but not in an emotional way.  Everything seemed to be in some sort of gray with very little other color.  The sky was gray throughout, everyone wore some sort of either white, gray or black and the whole movie seemed to need more light.  It was very difficult to watch.

B009FZFONO|5|Such an intriguing show with create character development and nonstop action. The show very gory, so if you are squeamish, this might not be the show for you. We started season 1 two weeks ago and were so hooked we watch season 1 and 2 and now are on 3. I can hardly wait until the next episode, they always leave you guessing!
B00F0LV22E|5|Top order historical novel, delicately balanced with historical fact and enlightened fiction. Gives great insight into truly heroic young women.
B003G4W49C|5|I liked how the book was very detailed in the descriptions. It was a really easy book to visualize while you read and that made for a very good book. I would recommend this to anyone. Young adults would especially like this. I chose a 5 star rating because that's what I think the book deserves.
B00008BXJF|5|King Crimson enter 2003 with the most amazing album, truly one of their all-time best five.<BR>It combines heavy metallic powerful pieces with beautiful transcendental music, all united by what have been called Belew's \\"musical haikus.\\" <BR>It opens up with the album's theme a cappella and then soars into the most yet powerful and mind-blowing version of Level Five. The drumming is especially amazing on this piece and together with Fripp's soloing and Trey Gunn's superb bass completely charges one up. Lyrical \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" soothes the listener after such a mean masterpiece. This is definitely a Belew's song and it is beautiful. \\"Facts of Life\\" is a heavy metal song by KC that is completely brand-new and absolutely grooves and rocks. Transcendental \\"The power to believe II\\" is one of my absolute favorites. It has evolved from Level 5's \\"Virtuous Circle\\" from \\"Level Five\\" and takes into a completely different wordl. It has Eastern feel to it and is rich wiht different mystical sounds and grooves. The voice in this track is also beautiful and adds to the richness of the song.  \\"Dangerous Curves\\" is even more powerful than on \\"Level Five.\\" \\"Happy\\" is another heavy track soaring wiht power. It is followed wiht \\"Power to Believe III\\" that has evolved (it seems to me) from \\"Deception of the Thrush.\\" The perfect closing piece on the album is \\"The Power to Believe IV: COda\\" re-stating the theme and offering the perfect conclusion to the musical journey undertaken by the listener.<BR>I personally absolutely love this album and cannot wait till hearing the guys live.<BR>The quality of sound is oustanding as well.<BR>In conclusion, this is an amazing album that is an absolute MUST for any Music Fan.
B00COGY2P2|2|I am so glad I didn't pay $11.00 for a ticket at the movies.  I'm sure this might appeal to teenage boys, but I am a senior female and I've seen Tom do this character again and again.  Being invincible and enigmatic is so two dimensional.  Perhaps Tom really can't do any other kind of role...well good luck to him.<br />The story which casts Tom as an avenger (again) fighting to correct injustice (again).<br />Fill in your own story...

0066214122|2|This is the first M.C. book I read. It was kind of fun, especialy liked the cliff-hanger parts on the end of the chapters. I almost expected a commercial after each.<BR>Michael Crichton delivers a fun book, but not a very well written book. I frowned. She frowned. They frowned. GET IT!?<br />If anyone is a Next Generation fan (Star Trek), you will be able to guess most of the book. Those crazy &quot;Nanites&quot;, were able to do so much in such a little time.  I kept expecting to see the Terminator 2 robot pop up somewhere in this book. <br />Once again, just like alot of his work, scientific advances go haywire in a secret isolated environment. I read the book. I frowned.<br />The ending is pure Hollywood.

1451648537|5|Excellent, Wonderful. Informative, Fascinating. I loved it from start to finish, but then I love everything Apple. Isaacson has written a page turner with full information from Steve Jobs and all of his friends and enemies with Steve's permission to tell Isaacson anything they wanted. While Jobs was brilliant, creative, and innovative, he also had a cruel and mean side. He was abandoned by his father and put up for adoption which was a large factor in his life, yet he abandoned his own daughter. He was run out of Apple, and then came back in when it was on the ropes and saved it with products that were never conceived of before. The details he demanded in product design and even packaging for the products has influenced many more industries into taking pride in the manner their products are presented. The book is long, thorough, very well researched and written. If you like to read, like computers, like biography, or don't have a book you are into, this is a book for you.

B000003BEV|4|I don't care what anyone says, this album is not trash.  The influence of the beatles' sgt. pepper is obvious, but what does that matter now.  It's not like it's a bad imitation either.  The album is actually more like the  beatles' magical mystery tour than sgt. pepper, accenting the bizarre side  of psychedelic music.  Songs like &quot;in another land&quot; and  &quot;2000 Light Years from Home&quot; are just as good as &quot;Blue Jay  Way&quot; or &quot;Baby, you're a rich man&quot; from Magical Mystery tour.   There is even some good folk rock mixed in with &quot;2000 man&quot; and  &quot;The lantern&quot;.  Other good songs include &quot;Sing this all  together&quot;, &quot;She's a rainbow&quot; and &quot;On with the  show.&quot;  Maybe the reason there is no respect for this album is because  the only rocker on the whole album is &quot;Citadel&quot;.  Or maybe it is  because of the inessential eight-minute psychedelic piece of junk  &quot;Sing this all together(see what happens)&quot;.  While this is not a  typical stones album, it is definitely worth a listen, especially for fans  of the Beatles' psychedelic period.

B00004RJ74|5|George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino star in this gangster/vampire crossbread that is, without a doubt, the best movie ever made. What sets this horror movie aside from others is that rather than killing off central characters from the start Scream style, it dedicates the entire first half to character development. This allows the audience to begin to actually care if a character dies or not. The story centers around a violent pair of outlaw brothers named Seth and Richard Gecko and an unwitting family they kidinap to help get them and their loot across the Mexican border. Once they get their they go to hide out in a sleazy bar where they stumble across an ancient den of vampires. Clooney and Tarantino, who spent the summer before shooting began together so they could interact in a believable way are one of the best on-screen duos in history. They are very diffrent and Clooney's(Seth) charm and charisma are the exact opposite of Tarantino's(Richard) menacing and creepy performance as a sex-offending dork from hell but even though the opening sequence characterizes the two as unrepentant killers the viewer still can't help but root for them. This is one of the rare movies that you can watch over and over again and not get tired of it. I would highly recommend you check this movie out as long as you can stand a little violence and bad language.
B00STPQ6KQ|5|Fantastic movie. Great acting, sets, costumes, effects. Excellent 3D cinematography as well. A very moving and inspirational telling of the story of Moses and one of Ridley's best movies. I'm still baffled by the hate this movie received, but ignore the haters and watch it.

B0000029LG|5|This cd is great! It's a blast from the past to hear all of Michael's top  songs that we loved years ago. From &quot;Billie Jean&quot; to &quot;Black  or White&quot; to &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot;, &quot;Beat it&quot;,  &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;Scream&quot;, &quot;Little Susie&quot;.... need  I go on? These two cds and jam packed with the songs that we loved, and  still love to dance to, and sing along with. Michael Jackson has lived a  life full of troubles, and misunderstanding... but that can't take away his  extraordinary talent, or the barriers he broke in musicianship. Way to go  Michael... we hope to hear more hits from you in the future!

B0034JKZ86|1|Talk about a disappointment. We have been dying to watch this movie since it came out. We finally got it for Christmas and stopped 30 min into it. The movie itself for quality was great, but there is a voodoo doctor in there that uses very dark and demonic magic to conjure up spirits and demons from the other side. In return for the power he promises to deliver lost souls to the ones he calls his 'friends on the other side'.  It definitely is not for children and I really don't feel for adults either since he's blatantly using satanic dark magic.  It never mentions this on the case and we sure wouldn't have bought it. I think Disney went way to far on this. Will not recommend this to anyone.

You guys took one of the most beautiful stars in the world and successfully made the ugliest CD cover in all of music history.  BUT, don't judge a book by its cover or in this case a CD by its cover!  The quality of music on this cd is AMAZING and some of Britney's best yet!  Every song is great.  They will get you moving and singing along as a good album should.  Blackout is the album everybody should own!  You won't be disappointed.  Viva la Britney!

B002H1MCY2|5|Japanese films have always had the remarkable reputation of turning the simplest premise into something so full of moving emotions and sensibilities. Yojiro Takita's multi-award winning film \\"DEPARTURES\\" (2008) is no different. There is a lot of excessive hype surrounding the film as it has almost nearly swept the Japanese Academy awards and has been awarded the Best Foreign film honor in the recent 2009 Oscars. No film can live up to the hype it has gotten, but I have to say it has earned each and every recognition; well deserving of the commercial success it had achieved in its native land.<br /><br />Daigo Kobayashi (Masahiro Motoki) is a cello player whose dream is shattered when the orchestra he is playing with goes broke. Left with no choice but to sell his prized cello, Daigo together with his wife Mika (beauteous Ryoko Hirosue) returns to his hometown to live in his mother's old house.  In need of a new job, Daigo responds to an ad in the local paper for a job in \\"Departures\\", thinking that it may be related to travel. But much to his surprise and dismay, Daigo discovers that he had applied for a profession as an `Encofineer'; a man who performs the delicate and traditional Japanese ritual of preparing the bodies of the deceased for the departure to the next life--it pays quite well, and without even thinking about it, he accepts without even giving his wife the details of his new job.<br /><br />It is not often that we become privy to a film about the beautifying of corpses, director Takita takes on the grim subject matter and gives it a commercial charm and appeal. The direction is quite meticulous in exposing the world of the mortician as we become witnesses to the Japanese customs and traditions as to how they deal with their dead. Takita shows that the profession demands a certain amount of sensitivity as we see the different reactions of those left behind by the deceased; some are angry, some are funny, most are overwhelmed by grief and some are curiously joyful. In Daigo's profession, there are no religious affiliation; they do what they do to preserve the memory of the deceased, remembering them as the way they used to be and not who they are in the present.<br /><br />It is a safe bet that a premise such as this may be unusual even for Japanese audiences and one of the film's key to success is the way it executes its grim subject matter through some doses of subtle humor in the film's first act. Writer Kundo Koyama and the direction by Takita meticulously eases the premise into the audience, as we were privy to Daigo and Sasaki's encounter with an extra \\"thing\\" to a supposedly female corpse. We see Masahiro Motoki's deadpan humor as he becomes repulsed by his first job, and just how he eventually becomes comfortable with his new career. Takita cleverly illustrates the short moments in the ceremony that our morticians get to know the deceased quite intimately.<br /><br />After everything sinks in, then the emotional scenes begin to take hold, as we learn more of Daigo's childhood, his problems with his wife's disapproval of his new job and his anger towards his father who had left him while he was a child to run off with a younger woman. Now this is a commercial film and we know that eventually people close to Daigo will eventually come to respect what he does for a living, it is a little predictable but the journey with which the film gets to where it wishes to go is well-played that the screenplay becomes somewhat of a melancholy with a rhythm that just looks so beautiful. Mika (played by Ryoko Hirosue) is just so lovable as the diligent wife; she is just so full of love and trust that her character represents the goodness within the Japanese woman. It was touching to see Daigo perform a ceremony in his wife's presence and director Takita carefully manipulates the camera work to show pure emotion. Takita also injects some sequences that are beautiful to awaken the emotion (sort of serves as a vanguard) as wesee Daigo playing the cello on a hill as if he was reaching out again to his dreams. The film also has beautiful cinematography and emotion-inducing score to match its otherwise simple but grim premise to keep the film running at a brisk pace.<br /><br />The film has two significant scenes that seemed to induce quite a few sniffles, they were injected to give a twist that plays a significant part in Daigo's life. The first one does provoke a lot of emotion; it is full of tear-inducing sequences that can definitely touch its audience. However, it does feel a little overlong that the second twist may lose some of the narrative impact to the inexperienced viewer. The two twists do work in unison in the screenplay but some may argue that Takita was working too hard to induce emotion working one twist right after the other. I didn't find anything wrong with it and I thought it stuck to its sensibilities in reflecting just how life can sometimes throw you in for a curve.<br /><br />The performances are quite good, Motoki (who won best actor in Japan) and Hirosue has some dynamic chemistry between them and the supporting characters made up of Sasaki, Yuriko (co-employee played by Kimiko Yo) and the woman (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) who runs a bath house plays their own significance in the script. I loved the way Yamazaki played Sasaki, it was like a cool and quiet boss as he always seemed to say \\"its fine.\\"<br /><br />Despite some flaws in the screenplay that the film came dangerously close in becoming too sentimental, \\"Departures\\" is easily one of the best commercial films to come out from Japan. The last act will leave an impression that no matter how we see ourselves and others, death sometimes is the one thing that can bring a family together. The film's biggest ace would have to come from its ability to induce the proper emotion at the right minute with such simplicity. Such critical acclaim will no doubt raise the film to unreasonable expectations, and while it may not change the face of Japanese cinema, it is not pretentious and never hides behind its beautiful visual style. The way to approach this film is with tempered expectations, so that the film can touch you in its journey that is both surprising and pleasurable.<br /><br />Highly Recommended! [4 ½ + Stars]<br /><br />The 2-disc region-3 release looks great and sounds great. The 1.78 ratio anamorphic widescreen video transfer is vivid and clean.

0790729687|5|On a Normal basis, i love the book version of a movie best than the movie itself. I have not read the book from anne rice yet, but i intend to do. I really loved this movie, its characters seemes very &quot;human&quot; to  me, all the passion in them as well as all the problems they had where  really moving, the character i liked the most was Lestat of course, but i  have heard that the Book lestat is even better, i certinly want to see  that. Great Costumes and above all a really worked out enviroment for the  movie.  Banderas was not what i have expected but he was not bad either. i  really ended hating Claudia (the character) but that only shows how good  played it was.

0593070461|4|I feel humbled by the other reviews on this website. Other chroniclers have offered comments drawn from personal experience, correcting the author on some point or other, because they knew better--as former employees, friends of Jeff Bezos, or even as spouse with an eye for protecting her husband's privacy. I cannot pretend to such special knowledge. If I choose to add my own contribution, it is because I found something missing in the book, something that stands at the heart of Amazon's corporate values: the consumer's perspective. Other stakeholders feature prominently in Brad Stone's narrative: the associates, the suppliers, the competitors, even the shareholders. But, as Jeff Bezos often points out, it's all about the consumer. Amazon is a consumer-centric company, pursuing consumer value as opposed to shareholder value, and whose objective function is to maximize consumer satisfaction. It is for the anonymous Amazon shopper that I wish to speak out, drawing from my particular experience as a non-American, overseas resident with a love for books and knowledge.<br /><br />Amazon's best advocates and staunchest critics are its own consumers. A whole corner of the website is devoted to discussions on topics relevant to Amazon, including a few threads on this book. Like other message boards and user forums, this is a place were consumers can vent their frustration, offer generous support to each other, and pursue practical jokes--one of the longest thread is related to panties. It is also one of the rare channel of communication where consumers can interact with Amazon representatives. As noted in the book, the telephone number for customer service is exceedingly difficult to find on the website. Jeff Bezos apparently believes that consumers are competent enough to fix problems themselves, when given the tools and information to do so. This doesn't mean he doesn't listen to them. When he gets a message from a consumer pointing to a problem, he forwards it with a single quotation mark that wears the authority of a wake-up clarion call. Employees have to drop everything they were doing in order to fix it, and to offer an explanation as to why it occurred in the first place. Bezos also often leaves one seat empty around the conference table: this seat stands for the consumer.<br /><br />In addition to the discussion boards and consumer service, each product page offers a space for consumer comments. This review feature is essential to the Amazon experience. It was added very early on to the website, the result of a single weekend of coding by the original Amazon programmer, Shel Kaphan. It was even part of the original vision of the \\"everything store\\" that Jeff Bezos conceived while discussing the birth of the Internet and its possible applications with his first boss and mentor, hedge fund manager D. E. Shaw. The early Amazon employees and their friends wrote many of the initial reviews themselves. These early reviews still feature on the Amazon website. As an example, the first book purchased on the website, Douglas Hofstader's Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies, still holds many of these early reviews, which were anonymous at the time. Jeff Bezos, his wife MacKenzie, and other key figures like well-known authors, are themselves occasional contributors to the website.<br /><br />At first, publishers and authors didn't see favorably this function, because they could get negative reviews as well as positive ones. But Jeff Bezos fervently believed in the power of the consumer to shape buying decisions, unhampered by marketing ploys and media campaigns. If negative reviews led to less sales for a product, so be it. As Bezos once put it, his goal was not to maximize sales, but to maximize consumer satisfaction. In the end, what's good for the consumer is good for the bottom line: \\"we don't make money when we sell things. We make money when we help customers make purchase decisions.\\" With time, many parties tried to rig the systemand influence the review results. They offered their own biased reviews, induced star reviewers to write positive comments, or trashed products offered by competitors. Amazon never saw these manipulations favorably, and still tries to prevent abuse and system gaming as best as it can.<br /><br />A key value proposal offered by Amazon is the speed of delivery. The possibility to have one's package reach one's doorstep in less than three days has done much to increase the popularity of online shopping. A key selling point in the Prime program is its offer of free two-days shipping. News has it that Amazon is also experimenting with drones in order to diminish delivery times to hours or even minutes. Here I have to add that the consumer experience is still closely tied to one's place of residence, and vastly differs across countries. My orders on the Amazon.com's website take more than three weeks to arrive to Korea, and  they include a hefty expedition fee. Some items are expedited from Germany or from Japan, leading to small batches and further delays. The \\"everything store\\" is still far from its original ideal as \\"an Internet company that served as the intermediary between consumers and manufacturers and sold nearly every type of product, all over the world.\\" Distance is not dead, and geography still matters.<br /><br />There is an addictive element built in the website. Of course, Amazon's goal is to encourage repeat visits and bigger purchases. It does so through various means: fidelity programs, premium offers, and an ever broadening choice of product lines and category brands. But addiction is also created through special features that cater to key stakeholders of the Amazon community. Reviewers are ranked according to a secret formula that takes into account the number of reviews and the approval rate of other consumers, who can endorse a review as \\"useful\\" or \\"not useful\\". I can testify that monitoring one's rank, rejoicing in each positive vote, and brooding over the number of \\"neggies\\", can turn into an obsession. Likewise, sales rank can be \\"like a drug to authors\\", and editors wish they would spend less time consulting it and more time writing their next book. Even for ordinary consumers, filling one's cart can turn into an obsessive pastime, even when one leaves most items out of the final package to be \\"saved for later\\" or added to the \\"wish list\\".<br /><br />Brad Stone shows that Amazon's corporate behavior closely mirrors Jeff Bezos' personality, which he describes as \\"relentlessly innovative and disruptive, as well as calculating and ruthless\\". Many personal traits and management techniques that define Jeff Bezos' and Amazon's public image are also writ large in the website. The competitive element is reflected in the reviewers' rank, as well as in the sales figures and authors' ranking. The raucous laugh that is a defining feature of Jeff Bezos' physical appearance is echoed by the big smile in Amazon's logo. Shopping on Amazon, like talking to its CEO, is an easy-going experience, full of unexpected twists and traits of humor, and also with a touch of nerdiness. Bezos preached urgency and expeditiousness with his first corporate motto, Get Big Fast, and speed is still one key selling point of shopping on Amazon, from one-click ordering to two-days shipping. Frugality, another key corporate value, is also reflected in the website's lack of fioriture and constant focus on low prices.<br /><br />Amazon.com wouldn't have been Jeff Bezos' personality writ large if it wasn't for the CEO's reading habits and consumer patterns. Bezos is the typical long tail buyer: among other items, he famously acquired the skeleton of an Ice Age cave bear, the original space suit and helmet of a cosmonaut, a zero-gravity chessboard, and various Star Trek memorabilia. His cultural influences--SciFi novels, Start Trek episodes, Wired magazine--led him to invest in space travel through the creation of his rocket company, Blue Origin--Brad Stone was the first journalist to bring this story to the public. The business writer also describes how some books--management textbooks or otherwise--fed into the strategy process of the company, with Jeff Bezos sponsoring corporate book clubs and mandated readings inside the company. \\"Jeff's reading list\\", presented in an appendix, thereby includes the autobiography of Sam Walton, the founder of Walmart; The Black Swan by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, himself a frequent book reviewer on Amazon; and various management bestsellers, such as Built to Last, The Innovator's Dilemma, and Good to Great. It also includes Kazuo Ishiguro's novel, The Remains of the Day, which led MacKenzie Bezos to point out the timing of its reading as a blatant example of the book's inaccuracy in her famous one-star review.

0385040253|5|This book is the indispensable, essential, must-have book of every knot a person could ever dream.  I bought three other knot books before this one, believing that Ashley's book was more than I needed.  Now the other three  books gather dust and this one is the only book I use.  It isn't just  knots, either.  Ashley also tells a lot of tales and lets us know what life  was like when he lived, as he collected the information to put together his  book.  I actually read this book sometimes just for the pleasure of reading  it.  You don't have to be tying knots.  It would be hard to imagine a book  that could improve on what Ashley has put together.  Simply outstanding.  I  love it.

159335259X|3|STORY BRIEF:<br />This is the second book in the Harry Bosch series.  So far there are 17 in the series.  Bosch is a Los Angeles Homicide detective - very smart at his job.  He always solves the mystery and finds the killer.  His biggest problem is his superiors.  His immediate boss, former bosses, internal affairs, and others whom he has to work with never seem to like him and cause problems.  He doesn't play political games to win their favor.<br /><br />In this story a fellow homicide detective Moore is found dead in a hotel room - an apparent suicide.  Harry was on call that night and at the scene, but his superiors tell him not to investigate, they will handle it.  Another detective Porter is quitting the force.  Bosch is asked to go through Porter's group of unsolved cases and pick one to work on.  As a result, Harry discovers that Moore was murdered (not a suicide), and that there are links to two other murders.  All of these are linked to the designer drug called \\"Black Ice.\\"  Harry travels to Mexico to investigate the drug lord Zosia whom Bosch believes is behind the murders.<br /><br />REVIEWER'S OPINION:<br />This was better than the 1st book, but not as good as the 5th book (the only others I've read so far).  The first book had too many unlikeable characters.  This was a little better in that regard.  It's very much a police procedural.  Bosch is slowly uncovering clues.  I prefer a little more relationship development or interesting characters to pull me in.  This book is missing those, but it was a good story.  I wasn't bored.  Many interesting things happen.  The plot and events were well done.  The ending is happy for those I am pulling for.  It's very acceptable as an audiobook, keeping my mind occupied as I do other things.  I like it enough to do all the books in the series.  I think this could be read as a stand-alone.<br /><br />When Bosch did an illegal break-and-enter to investigate, I liked what he did so that the evidence would stay where it was until he could legally enter later with a warrant.  He did some other impressive things as well.<br /><br />CAUTION SEMI-SPOILER:<br />Something interesting:  In book 1, Bosch cared about a woman who committed a crime.  He insisted she turn herself in.  He put the law above his feelings for her.  In book 2, Bosch cared about a woman who was innocent.  Bosch kept a secret about someone else's actions in order to help her.  Bosch did not follow the law which would have meant exposing the secret.<br /><br />NARRATOR:<br />The narrator Dick Hill was pretty good here.  In two other books he used an \\"effeminate gay guy voice\\" for females which annoyed me.  His voice for females in this book was better.  And his voice for male characters was very good.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Unabridged audiobook length: 11 hrs and 11 mins.  Narrator: Dick Hill.  Swearing language: occasional use - strong.  Sexual language: none.  Number of sex scenes: two, told not shown.  Setting:  1992 Los Angeles and Calexico, California, and Mexicali, Mexico.  Book Copyright: 1993.  Genre: crime mystery.

B0096YJDNQ|3|Firs impressions:<br />YES! it is it, but then many but...<br /><br />Interface:<br />Great nice looking interface but with very small buttons and gadgets.<br /><br />Usability:<br />In some features, application have similar behavior as other that type applications, but because small buttons and gadgets I have issue to use this application in real situation. Also when I moving the tablet, the screen does not move smoothly.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />There are many good applications which user can use for this purpose, many with better functionality. Maybe other applications have less data then this, but they definitely more usable then current application.<br /><br />This application doesn't have my recommendation.
B00005RHGL|4|After loving this movie for so long (probably Val Kilmers best role) I was very excited to see it re-released as a deluxe edition. The 5.1 audio upgrade really makes a difference over the previous 2.0 DVD. Now the bullets wiz buy and tumbleweed well, tumbles by. The picture is great, this movie really looks good on a large screen and was made for DVD. Some of the features are better than others. I thought the timeline was very informational, especially if you like this western as you learn the truth from the fiction. The Epitaph while not an exciting piece is also interesting to read the real newspaper account from way back when it actually happened. And to see the ads in the paper was cool too. There is a ROM game, which is a lot of fun, and re-playable which is always a plus in my humble opinion. If you like to gamble then install this on your PC. There are a ton of trailers and while they don't interest me too much it is interesting to see how many ways a movie can be spun. <br />Kudos and thumbs up on the new version and the cool bonus.

0345807294|3|As a long time resident of northern California, Dave Eggers seems to consider Google (the company) a bit more prominent and powerful than do those far from the Pacific.  To me, Google is an exciting company but with an extreme vulnerability towards a deteriorating environment for digital advertising, a company that can be outflanked technologically and within 5 years relegated to an afterthought.  In “The Circle”, we have a Google stand-in that is all powerful, inexhaustible financing and logistical capabilities directed quickly and successfully to whatever ambitious objective it puts in its crosshairs.<br /><br />This view of Google as a business ties in directly with what I see as one of the novel’s narrative flaws: the use of the Very Bad Guy.  This overuse of the Very Bad Guy in books and movies has become a real bugbear for me; I see it even seeping into the children’s programming my kids watch.  The Very Bad Guy is a type of villain that is irreducibly wicked – they are smart, powerful, lacking in any complexity – a target for anger and vengeance without any redeeming human qualities.  Dave Eggers elevates the Circle to the level of the Very Bad Guy.  I see that as a failing of Eggers as an artist.  Villains should ideally be more complex or weaker or flawed, in anything more than low-quality pulp fiction or movies.  “The Circle” is supposed to be a serious novel for adults addressing “issues.”  I do give Eggers credit for identifying these issues and do like some of his catchphrases. (“Privacy is theft” may emerge from this novel as a long-standing quasi-Orwellian 21st-century catchphrase.)  But the elevation of the Circle/Google into some all-powerful narrative device degrades “The Circle” as a novel.  It also softens Eggers’ social criticism.<br /><br />I was reminded of Gary Shteyngart’s excellent and thought-provoking “Super Sad True Love Story” when reading “The Circle.”  Both books are dystopias, but Shteyngart as a comic writer points his wit towards and eviscerates not just the incompetent yet technologically-advanced (fraudulent??) business employing his protagonist, but the American population itself (gullible fools), our country’s government (bankrupt and yet oppressive), his boss (more misinformed than criminal), current sexual mores (its freedom mocked) and social media (which clouds the deluded users’ ability to understand events occurring around them).  Such novelistic subtlety is absent from “The Circle.”<br /><br />The straightforwardness of Eggers’ thinking combines with a plain style and, in Mae Holland, a fairly uncomplicated lead character to make for a flat book.  “The Circle” is a novel that constantly reminded me how difficult they are to write, how much subtle thought and invention is needed.  Eggers has something valuable to say, but the novelistic realization combines with a viewpoint that isn’t particularly original to make this a bit of a miss.a comic writer points his wit towards and eviscerates not just the incompetent yet technologically-advanced (fraudulent??) business employing his protagonist, but the American population itself (gullible fools), our country’s government (bankrupt and yet oppressive), his boss (more misinformed than criminal), current sexual mores (its freedom mocked) and social media (which clouds the deluded users’ ability to understand events occurring around them).

B0086900TI|5|My wife and I watched Tony Kay’s “Detachment” on a DVD that we bought from Amazon—a film that came out in 2012 with a substitute teacher as the main character. Henry Barthes was played by Academy Award winner Adrien Brody—who in the film struggles to keep others at a distance.<br /><br />Henry’s mother was an alcoholic who committed suicide when he was a child. His grandfather, who raised Henry, has dementia, lives in a home for the elderly and is haunted by guilt for molesting his own daughter.<br /><br />“Detachment” takes place in a community and high school that seems worse than where I taught for thirties years but not by much.<br /><br />If you see this film and pay attention, you’ll noticed that in the background there are kids who were not threatening their teachers; were not disrupting the classroom and actually paid attention and turned in work. “Detachment’s” one flaw was focusing too much on the worst kids and mostly ignoring those who cooperated. In addition, the film focused on only a handful of teachers who were burned out.<br /><br />For instance, at the one meeting where the entire staff gathers there were many teachers in attendance that we didn’t get to know in the film, and there was one young teacher in a brief scene who we see working late after school helping a student with school work.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think “Detachment” is an honest film that shows the harsh reality of teaching in an inner city high school surrounded by poverty, drugs, street gangs, violence and parental neglect.

0375507256|5|It's rare these days to come across an new, original masterpiece.  It's a tough book to write a review of because there are so many incredible surprises and I don't want to create any spoilers - but the writing, the brilliance is so extraordinary - my advice is just read the book before reading this review further, but if you feel you need to know more, here you go:    This book is about \\"its structure\\", which consists of 6 stories, 5 of which are divided in half and placed around the 6th.  The book is mostly about power, slavery, hatred and violence, and yet is full of humor and truly enjoyable to read.  Each of the 6 stories is written in a different style - one is a diary, another is a series of letters, another is a pulp fiction novel, one is an autobiography (of which a character in a later story views the movie version of), one is an interview, one is an \\"oral history\\".  Each of the stories is also a document featured in a later stories - for example, in the second story, the first story is discovered in the library.  Also, the stories are critiqued in each other - in the second story, the problems and inconsistencies of the first story are pointed out.  There are other themes and links, from birthmarks to names to ships.  It never seems artificial or contrived however. The stories span centuries and cultures, although many of them center on or relate to the Big Island in Hawaii.    Some of the reading is difficult - the middle story is written in the author's own created futuristic dialect (shoes are called \\"nikes\\" for instance), which sometimes takes a while.  The initial story is difficult to follow at times, and the book requires a fair amount of concentration.  Much of the book is surprisingly exciting and interesting.  I've never read anything quite like it.

B00271DNP4|5|In year three, our cast of unique and magical characthers have to deal with a new threat, an escaped prisoner, from Azkaban Prison, who seems to want to kill Harry Potter. Azkaban was a return to the magical formula that made Harry Potter legendary. The story here is suburb and unlike the Chamber of Secrets, it isn't dummied down or rushed for us. New elements are introduced such as the secret map and time travel, but perhaps most important of all we finally see Harry demonstrate some of this incredible power that has led to his fame at Hogwarts. The story was terrific, the action was great, the performances were off the chart, and the childish stuff was kept to a minimum, but was Azkaban perfect? Many critics will tell you that this is the best of the Potter films and it was terrific, but personally I was hoping to see more of the world outside of Hogwarts. I was looking forward to possibly seeing the inside of Azkaban prison and some of the people who are locked up there. While I appreciate the different views and new filming location, it was still centered at Hogwarts. Not a bad thing, but personally I'd have liked to have seen something else. Aside from that, new Director, Alfonso Cuaron, does use parts of the story that were excluded in the previous films, he also does give us a new location, and view of things. Overall, Cuaron really does do a tremendous job, making this film geared more toward young adults than children. Azkaban is much closer to being what J.K. Rowling intended than the Chamber of Secrets was. I absolutely loved this film, there are just some parts of this film that are truly amazing. If you're picky like I am, and are only going to give Harry Potter one shot, then I suggest the film you watch is The Prisoner of Azkaban.
B006LSZECO|4|This book is nuts and everyone in it is a psychotic hotmess !!!! Just when you think you know what is going to happen next- plot twist!!
B0059XTUB8|5|It's a great insight on the tragic life of Marilyn Monroe.  It really shows how things were set up to where people only saw what they wanted people to see so often. A stunning beauty with a dose of magic in every shot taken of her but on the inside she had a problem with men and depression which came with pills, all which i believe led to her death at such an untimely age. Michelle Williams doesnt particurly look like her, no, but shes such a great actress.  Despite physical differences I think she was perfect for the part.  Eddie Redmayne is just green enough to where he is convincing as Colin. Its a beautiful movie, well acted.
B00IURL19Y|5|Perfect for me.
B00KQA6JM2|3|Very good
B00E8KLWB4|5|Definitely fun and addicting!  Not necessary to spend money to play if you have  lot of patience.
B00FATEJYE|5|I guess it's cool game.
B000002LOE|5|Most \\"true\\" R.E.M. fans, who define themselves as having purchased Murmur the week it was released, trash this album with regularity. The criticism is unjustified. This is one of the three definitive R.E.M. releases (together with Life's Rich Pageant and Automatic.) Sure, it was popular and earned massive sales and airplay, but don't hold that against it. <br /> <br />This is a Tour De Force from start to finish. No clunkers here. \\"Losing My Religion\\" was so popular that it is easy to ignore, but has there ever been a more compelling song ever made? \\"Shiny Happy People\\" is the most misunderstood, ironic R.E.M. song. My personal favorite: the haunting \\"Half a World Away.\\" This is R.E.M. at its peak.
B00IXF8PLU|5|About a girl that is adopted Nazi Germany.  A very sad story the ending.  Should of been up for best picture.  And the girl for best supplying actress
B00000K3UU|5|The story of the film is really just about a guy named Sonny Koufax who has a cool life, where he has no job and basically no responsibilities, and a sexy girl friend. One day she gets fed up up with him and tells him to grow up and get a decent job. As his girl friend left he went over to see his room mate and as he entered his house everyone wasted the suprise on Sonny. Everyone was very disapointed because they wasted it on sonny when they wanted to say it to the other room mate who was leaving to china for a few weeks. As the room mate leaves Sonny gets a kid sent to him with a note saying that it was the room mates kid. Sonny called the room mate up and told him he had his kid right here. Sonny ended up looking after him and raising him to become like him which was very funny. Later on in the movie he visits his ex girl friend and tries to impress her with his kid, though things start to go wrong as Sonny finds out she's sleeping with a old man. HOW WILL SONNY WIN HER BACK!!!!!!!!! one of the funniest parts in the movie was when Sonny had a little talk yo by the kids teacher and the teacher had some very bad things to say about the kid which where very funny. Another funny bit was when the kid goes daddy can i have my night light, and so Sonny turns on a lit up sign saying live nudes with an arrow pointing to the right. I really loved this movie, it was very hillarious with more than 20 hillarious bits. It is one of the most hillarious films i had seen and the ending was very sweet and even through out the film it was sweet. Adam Sandler is a great actor and he had the most suitable part in the movie for him. Adam Sandler has done some great work and i hope he keeps up the great work. If you like this film i suggest you go see the new movie with him in, mr deeds and believe me you won't regret it, but i have to say mr deeds was not as funny as big daddy, but it is great and i hope more people in the world start to know more about Adam Sandler and understand whyhe is such a great funny sweet actor. If i had to have a favourite Adam sandler movie it would propbably be waterboy, which was a very sweet touching film. So yeah overall a great film worth watching, SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!!!!!!! GET OFF YOUR CHAIR AND GO HIRE THIS VIDEO!!!!!! AND SLAP THIS BABY ONTO YOUR VIDEO PLAYER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006OOHYIC|5|I had been having trouble falling asleep recently and this game, with it's smooth visuals and some of the best music I've heard from a mobile game in a long time, helped me relax. I now try to play whenever I'm feeling restless, and it always helps. Great game.
B0017ANAZO|1|Superficial. Having not seen the original movie and not knowing that this was a remake, makes me now want to see the original.  Why does Hollywood keep remaking movies? I can say that in watching this, I was reminded of another movie made in the 40's?? It was about a woman - a socialite, and her husband left her and she was out of home and staying with friends, and still trying to exist on the far fringes of the society she came from. Everyone knew, some took sides, some acknowledged her, some didnt, and in the end, he called and told her to come home and she was ecstatic. I felt that movie said more about that time period than anything.    I felt the actresses in this movie, \\"The Women\\", were playing themselves. The only person that was funny and you felt for was Ms. Leachman. I couldn't feel for any of these people. And personally knowing many divorced women that dont shop at Saks, that aren't in high-power positions, I feel this movie was for a different demographic...I dont know which one.     In researching through Amazon today, I came across a book titled \\"Factory Girls\\" where the author describes chinese female factory workers who aren't \\"passive victims\\", and that instead the author found them to be \\"resourceful and ambitious, full of plans to improve their lot and change their fates, willing to challenge their bosses and quit their jobs for better ones, and willing to take night classes to improve themselves\\" and most importantly, they're not victims of circumstance. Maybe this would make a more compelling movie.
B0089LOG02|4|Very interesting.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Fantastic product. Bought when in US then used in UK on return home with some adjustments as only S video connections available (purchased conversion box from Amazon which works well) - excellent in both countries.
B000U0F7RG|1|Let me begin by saying this is a review of the product...NOT the show. The show is one of my all time favorites, I miss it and I wish it were still on.<br /><br />Anyway, I had purchased every season individually as they were released. Each season was in a very nice, well constructed box set and the design of them fit the show perfectly. I'm a person who appreciates a good product when I see it and I was happy to collect these.<br /><br />As a collector, I was VERY surprised and pretty disappointed to see this complete series set. I had every intention of buying it when it came out...glad I didn't. A friend bought it before I had the chance and I have never seen something so poor. The discs are in cardboard sleeves that promote scratching. The box itself is very flimsy and not very well put together. And who designed it? The design is WAY off and doesn't really go with the show. It's cheap and just all together weird. It all seems very much thrown together as an after thought. Clearly not much was put into this as all the pics and graphics look like they were done in someone's basement using photoshop and bad stock photos. I was expecting something SO much better. Especially for the price.<br /><br />Needless to say, I decided NOT to purchase it. I'll stick with my individual seasons. I would suggest others just buy them seperately as well. I was hoping for MUCH better treatment for one of my favorites.
B00W6XM002|5|I just love this game it is so much fun to play, but it is not hard to level up at all. Not like Candy crush , where you can get stuck for weeks at a time. I like this one much better.
B000W9EOEC|3|If you like loud, instrumental music these kids are the big deal today. I wanted hear what the kids are hearing and I can take it only for so long....but they are talented. No wonder thay won so many grammy's!!!

B0034G4OY0|3|Okay Movie
B003V6L94Q|5|I love all almost all the songs on this cd.this was well worth the money and I am glad I purchase it.
B0026NBZDU|5|Twist and turns you will not predict in advance. If this were not clearly documented as authored by Waters, I would have sworn it is a recently discovered unpublished book written by Dickens.<br /><br />Waters does an excellent job of researching the context this story.<br /><br />Very different and a eyebrow raising read!
B00EB6F1TY|5|....no complaints here to complain about & do recommend to anyone... ;)
B00DR0PDNE|3|When it works, it works great, otherwise it can be very finicky to setup.  I had to reboot my router 3 times last time I did it.  It works much better off a phone or when using one of the specified Apps, but streaming video from PC to TV, not so good.  For the money though, it is so worth it.
B009ZE27US|5|enjoyed
B00I8Q77Y0|5|I only did this for other colors so I don't care
B007W8S2MG|5|For some reason I could  never get into the Persona series. I tried them, then it would almost immediately be decided that this style of JRPG just wasn'r for me. Then, when Persona 3 went on special, I decided to give it another try. After 96 hours later, I was hooked! When I heard of P4G, I just couldn't believe it. Immediately I felt at home. The presentation, the colors, the sound track, the characters and the relationships (Social Links), and the mystery story, all come together perfectly to make a truly engrossing experience. Sure, it definetely helps if you are a fan of JRPG's (lots of grinding), slice of life social sims (every day life) and definetely Anime in general (all the usual tropes surface). I definetely recommend this title as it perfectly fits in a mobile environment. Finally I put away buyer's remorse for my VITA.
0451468228|5|A fascinating story of mankind's struggle to rise above its own inhumanities, viewed from the intertwined perspective of the families of characters deeply affected by the unfolding of events in the history of the World Wars, and of the failed plight of Communism.  The author reveals the sad truth of the human experience, the brutality and senselessness of self righteous, mis-guided societies quest for a \\"better world\\". Fortunately, a glimmer of hope, is revealed in the courage and devotion of those who risked all, for the sake of decency, honor and above all, genuine love.  Follett's remarkable compilation exemplifies the adage \\"there is two sides to every story\\".
B00HDMMISA|5|This story is interwoven with many characters and all their personalities beautifully. There are many unexpected twists and smaller stories. Couldn't put it down!
B00OIG3CAC|5|Amazing!
B000FC1HBY|5|Its a great book...I have them all and bought them for my Kindle too.  I can't get enought of GOT
B001GAPC1K|4|The movie was not too long, just right I would say. Has good flow and well photographed.
0545259096|4|You know, since this book has been sitting in my shelf for over a year, I thought it was time that I finally read it. I initially put it away because I did not want the series to end. Now, that I have read it, it didn't feel as satisfying as I thought it would.<br /><br />Plot. First of all, the plot felt the exactly the same as the first two books. They are still fighting against their wolf-selves as well as threats from the human world. Nothing much change other than the fact that now their were finally going to make a decision about their future and well being.<br /><br />Love. The love interest of course didn't stray away from what has already been grown. Of course now, Sam is just trying to wait for Grace and is even going to great lengths to protect her the best his can. In this book, I found more interest in the minor characters, Cole and Isabel. Their story really shined and brought of light a lot of truth.<br /><br />Cure. Well, that's one way to put it. But does is work is the question.<br /><br />Ending/Future. I think the way the book ended is not very satisfying. I mean, yeah, they have to place to live with no fear of being hunted and also a cure. Still, I felt like this book ended vague, cause you can still have questions but also complete cause it ended on a good note.<br /><br />Forever is a good conclusion. Emerging with a good ending, leaving the reader hopeful, Forever is great.
0385344333|5|I shall not repeat the reviewers who provided a story synopsis. Rather, I'm writing this review for the Lee Child/Reacher fans who may be wondering about all of the negative reviews. I've not checked, but would chance a guess that the current three star average must be the lowest Mr. Child has ever received. Personally, the low ratings stimulated my curiosity to the point where I had to purchase the book just to see for myself the depths to which the author and his popular character have sunk.<br /><br />Fortunately, within the first few chapters I received the reassurance that neither Lee Child nor Jack Reacher have lost their touch. Ever observant and with an uncanny ability to figure other people out, Reacher did not disappoint. As with every other Lee Child book I've read, this one kept me up until I finished it.<br /><br />So why the negative reviews? Read a few of them and you begin to smell sour grapes. Could it be that fans disappointed that Tom Cruise will play Reacher on the big screen are willing to throw a skilled author and one of their favorite characters under the bus?<br /><br />I too was disappointed that Tom Cruise will play Reacher, I had always imagined Vin Diesel in the role. But everyone knows how Hollywood works. Many movies created from books barely resemble their source. That is why the question--which did you like better, the movie or the book?--is so frequently heard.<br /><br />My advice to potential readers is to forget the noise, read the book, and decide for yourself. I'm glad I did.
B0063IH60K|5|I love my solitaire game. It is very easy to use and colorful. A fun game I have loved since childhood.
B004JZBGWI|5|This is such a great app. It's very useful for all audiences. No adds or glitches. Also it's instant. Don't worry about finding the perfect app....... because it's right here.
B005OKTPKC|3|A good holiday read. Not much brain power needed. Not hard to read. You'll turn the pages to the end and wish it went on for another 100 pages.
B007XKEY6Q|4|Fun drawing game to play with your game loving kids. I am not a good artist but get good enough for guessing.
B000002JQ6|4|First off, I'm not a huge AC/DC fan.  I love their hits, and enjoy the rest of their material, but not enough to go out and buy all their albums.  If you're like me, this is one of the few AC/DC records that's really essential.  Most of their big hits are here--with extra live energy, and sounding great.  Nothing beats the crowd chanting \\"Angus\\" in the beginning of \\"Thunderstruck.\\"  AC/DC's dirty style lends well to a live album--they don't do a lot of overdubs, so it's pretty much the same sound as on the album, with a crowd that actually adds to the record's merit for a change.  It's good to hear all the hits live--\\"Back in Black,\\" \\"You Shook Me,\\" \\"Highway to Hell,\\" and \\"T.N.T.\\" all sound top-form, but it's also good to hear the less well-known tunes like \\"The Jack,\\" and \\"For Those About to Rock.\\"  I'm sure huge fans would disagree that  this album is satisfactory for the full AC/DC experience, but I bet they don't deny that it's a hell of a good live album of their favorite band.  Check it out as a good retrospective, and if you like it a ton, check out more of their classic albums.
B00E8KLWB4|4|A slight glitch but still fun to play
B00AREIAI8|5|Great app. Its fun for anyone of any age. Good app to play when you are bored too. It has moments when it freezes up but not enough to crash.
B005MYEQ4U|5|An exceptionally entertaining movie combining, in a near-perfect blend, a particularly clever story, excellent actors and acting, and, most of all, the genius of Woody Allen!
B0012NVGHU|5|Great artistry! A must see for all romantic musicians and anyone who believes in soulmates!
B00BJ9VBLI|5|Love the fact you can play in<br />un-timed mode. Lot's of replayability. Plays great on my Kindle Fire. Good value.
B00JBEI7VK|1|Why in the world would a paid app need to know the contents of my device, contacts, storage, identity, accounts, etc.?????? Just like Big Brother!
B00004CX83|1|received on time but the dvd wouldnt play. I did not return bc the cost<br />to return and all of the hassle.
B007OWRBJK|5|Quite a gripping read. My only complaint is that Townshend doesn't tie the experiences in his personal life to the music he created as a result. Sometimes it's mentioned, but only as an afterthought.
B00EE3FVSU|5|This is a favorite show for me. Now watching Season 2.
B00COGY2P2|4|The star of the movie was the Super Sport Chevelle battle with the Audi.  I did like the movie and would recommend it to friends and if you are in the mood for an action adventure it is a good choice. The plot kept me interested and the acting was good. I do not want to give away any details but I was glad to see the villain get his and the dynamics of the father and daughter keep me guessing till the end.
B00CWR4YCE|2|Not very long, just patterns, no photos. I would not recommend it to anyone. Wish I had not purchased it.
B006MW3UZW|5|We are thoroughly enjoying season 2. Looking foward to season 3.
B00F2NOPFG|3|Obviously the packaging has been redone because the content inside were loose and steelbook paper cover seems to be torn.
B000RPTQ1C|1|Pre-ordered this one with great expectation. But it turned out to be such a huge disappointment like a third-grade, street rockers' works. Loud, clueless, and souless.
B002HFP0QU|5|i love the bee geess soooo much so i love to play all the time swwt sweet sweet sweet  sweet sweet sweet i  love it its so good
B00IFS2LSI|5|I was not a big Afghan Whigs fan prior to this album...I knew of them, especially back in the 90s when they were last churning out work, but their music really wasn't up my alley. This album, however, is fantastic. I'm not sure how to categorize it or describe it. Emotional swagger, maybe? Matamoros, Algiers, It Kills, and Can Rova stand out. These guys got better with age.
B00VFTCGES|5|I like SciFi and found this movie interesting, a bit dry and pretentious at times, but overall I enjoyed it.
B0001611DI|1|I'm not trying to desecrate any opinions or start any fights, but there have been several reviews bashing this film, and I truly have to agree w/them.  The film is certainly not a \\"horror classic,\\" as it has been called, and it's much more hyped up than it deserves to be. <br />We can start w/the good things about this film:  the tagline is great, the music decent, and the idea is truly horrifying, but the feeling I get from this film is that Romero doesn't always know what direction he wants to take.  The acting and the writing are so unbelievably bad, the film provides many more laughs than scares, so at first, you're under the impression that Romero is trying to make a comedy.  Then, at the most random times, he makes the decision to throw some of the goriest and most disturbing scenes at you, as though he's saying, \\"This entire film you haven't been taking me seriously.  Well...take me seriously NOW!\\"  Whether he's trying to provide viewers w/a funny film or a scary film, Romero fails miserably. <br />Then, there's the make-up effects:  this is where we must give Night of the Living Dead its points.  Despite the fact that it was created during an earlier age, the zombies actually look like zombies.  Dawn of the Dead, which was released in 1978, ten years after its predecessor, has had a good while to progress in the field of make-up...this is not evident.  The blood is pink, and the zombies look like (and probably are) just a group of extras that have had their faces splashed with gray paint, and you can actually see the lines on their necks where the make-up ends, and on top of that, the zombies are slow, stupid, and completely non-menacing.  The film is much longer than it needs to be, offers no character development, and is boring in every aspect.  Night of the Living Dead definitely has its corny moments, but after seeing it, you definitely feel the need to look behind you every once in while.  After seeing Dawn, you'll find yourself feeling sleepy. <br />Wenow move on to the most important aspect of the film.  The previews, posters, and pretty much all forms of publicity use the phrase, \\"When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.\\"  Despite this fact, it is never once explained in the film that this is the reason why the dead are returning to life.  In fact, we receive no explanation at all for this \\"phenomenon\\" (for lack of a better term).  There is actually plenty of unexplained material and activity in this film.  The beginning makes no sense, whatsoever, and neither does the biker scene that serves as the climactic end.  For example, during the \\"biker\\" raid, one thug, despite the fact that he's surrounded by several hungry zombies, randomly decides to give himself a blood pressure test.  Naturally, he's devoured w/in a matter of seconds. <br />Finally, there seems to be some sort of idea that this is Romero's take on social commentary.  He has denied this on several occasions. <br />In conclusion, I would say completely avoid the original.  The remake is a huge improvement, offering greater acting, writing, character development, and zombies that can definitely be defined as \\"NASTY.\\"
B0000AMRJC|5|Al Pacino along with Robert De Niro are to me, 2 of the greatest actors in Hollywood since the 70s. Al Pacino is brilliant and unforgettable in this one (as he also was in Serpico) as the Cuban refugee who is uneducated, ambitious and without scruples. Mastrantonio acted out the role as sister so well, and the hint of a potentially incestuous relationship between them two was apparent from the start - when I saw the scene when Pacino visits his mum and sister for the first time in America, when he was hugging and kissing his sister for a bit too long and a bit too affectionately, I thought she must have been his girlfriend from Cuba! I never realised they were siblings until his mother was shouting at him to get lost because she &quot;doesn't want a son like him&quot;, that I realised these two weren't lovers. Such was the unspoken but truly well-played roles that Pacino and Mastrantonio took and this brilliance lingered on for the rest of the film. Michelle Pfeiffer too, is every bit the convincing bitchy coke-addicted vamp who is the object of 2 prominent syndicate members' desires. She was younger then, but she stood out. <br />The movie is fast, quite unpredictable at times, and full of guns, drugs and bloodshed. Not to mention its soundtrack and theme (and possibly storyline) must have inspired the idea behind one of the most popular Playstation 2 games on the market today -  &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; - because most of the songs in the PS2 game were the exact same 80s tracks that were played in this movie on and off. I am really impressed by this movie. Normally I don't go for gangster flicks, but in this case and in the cases of certain other Al Pacino and Robert De Niro gangland flicks... I make exceptions. I love these 2 actors!
B003XE3HA0|2|I have several  pairs of Crocs that I wear to work every day, I am on my feet all day long. I love  my Crocs, it's like wearing my house slippers to work.  This particular pair is small compared to another pair I have had for several years that is the same style and size. This pair is also small as far as height, it's like my foot is suddenly too tall for the shoe. I have never had this problem or any problem with any other Crocs products before. I am disappointed.
B000929AJQ|5|I waited a long time to write this review for a reason.  I wanted to see, because there are so many haters of this album out there, how it stood up to The Fragile, the album prior to it's release, and Year Zero, the album which came out afterwards.  It is comparable to both, with The Fragile and Year Zero being my favorite NIN albums of all.  I see all these people writing and saying how terrible this album is, that Trent just put something out to sell records because he hadn't put an album out in a long time.  That's bush!!  The music on this album is awesome.  It's as textured at times as The Downward Spiral or The Fragile, or even Year Zero, and at other times as heavy as Broken.  Plus the live drumming that Dave Grohl provides on most of the tracks is excellent.  And the lyrics are pretty good if you listen to them.  Sure, Trent deals with coping with love, anger ,being lonely, and heartache.  This is obvious on tracks \\"All the Love in the World, \\"Love is not Enough\\", \\"Only\\", and \\"Sunspots\\".  He also is leading to the political precursor of Year Zero with tracks like \\"The Hand that Feeds\\", and \\"Right Where it Belongs\\".  This is just a message to all of the haters out there that Trent was writing about the things he knew about and the things that were important to him.  And if anyone thinks that the music itself is bad, have your hearing tested.  Keep up the great work Trent.

B003XF1XOQ|5|This is a great book and a good ending to an amazing trilogy. Would recommend reading this and the other Hunger Games books.
B009UX2YAC|5|My 7 and my 5 year old love this game and I like to play with it as well.I recommended
B007J4T2G8|2|Was not what I thought it would be. I found myself bored often, because if they were having a sexual episode; the remainder of the book was basically emails.
B0026S1XD2|5|Very rarely will you find an album that is a hit when it has 2 numbers that last over 25 minutes. This album has that and for those of you way too young to remember the haunting theme from The Exorcist is on here
B0068THAGY|4|This film was much better than I expected.  The acting was superb, the effects were also.  But it really had that 50's horror feeling, where you know the monster was there, but you never saw it, at least until the end.  It's too bad more movies are not made this way anymore.  Now it's all about the special effects, and getting the monster in your face. This movie harkens back to a time when directors understood that weak special effects were not the reason you didn't show the monster right from the beginning.<br /><br />There was nothing weak about the effects in this movie.  It is well done all the way through.  You will enjoy it.
B004LOMB2Q|4|I am still learning my way around Evernote but I love clipping things and being able to find them on any of my devices. It is also great to create folders to organize my documents.
B006885LZM|5|Great series about the sacrifices made for our freedom and the freedom of others.
B004KPLVV8|5|Tron was a Disney production that is truly one of a kind, a classic in every sense. It started as an idea: \\"What is it like inside your computer? Is there a world in there? Are there people? What does it look like? What kind of culture would it have?\\" Computers were still a new and fantastic kind of machine in 1982, and it was only natural that it would lead to a new kind of fantasy, something original for people to romanticize over. The creative team behind this production took that concept and ran with it. They visualized what a bit looks like and how it behaves, they defined the physical aspects of a data stream, how programs might interact with each other, and how a world made of light might look.    The artwork of this film is what stands out the most. Computer generated images were new technology at the time and not nearly as impressive as today, but that is only a fraction of what makes this movie stunning. All of the heavily stylized design of the sets to the intricate details of the costumes, which while certainly unconventional for the actors, gave their characters unique and impressionable appearances while making it look as though they were wrapped in a circuit board. Tron had a look that was all its own and no film has managed to duplicate that level of creativity since, and once you see it, it will stay with you forever.    Story-wise the film is an epic tale inside a computer. It focuses more on the fantasy of discovering a new world not outside of our own, but within it. There are heroes and villains in both worlds as the oppressive Master Control Program dominates all other programs on what would come to be known as `The Grid'. It's an adventure in cyberspace filled with action and drama that you will enjoy every second of.    As far as this DVD package of the film goes, it's a great buy. The picture is great, and the extras are fantastic. On top of which, it's a lot cheaper than getting the blue ray edition, and a lot cheaper than one of the combopack that couple it with the new Legacy film. I'd strongly recommend it to everyone.
B00413QB5A|4|Of all this authors books, this one fell just a bit short of how I feel about  the usual fast pace, page turning &#34;can't put it down&#34; novels. However, let me say, if you have ANY interest in Italian ART and the exquisite countryside destinations, you will certainly enjoy this<br />amazingly wonderful journey throughout each page. I look forward to reading each and every publication this author writes. It just happened this was not one of my favorites...but don't let me stop you from reading it. Readers are subjective critics.

0375842381|5|In my writing class at UCLA, my professor taught the class that rereading pieces of literature gives the reader new insight into the work because not only does the time around the writing change, but the reader changes as well.<br /><br />I began reading the first book in Phillip Pullman's trilogy probably over five years ago.  As a nineteen-year-old, that's a good chunk of my life.  My bookmark showed that I had finished the first two books of the series and was about a third-way through the final book.  When I picked up the series to read again a couple weeks ago, I barely remembered anything I had read.  As a child, I never really picked up on characterization or foreshadowing or any of those fancy writing devices that were pounded into my head in high school.  Reading a book as a child was simply a different experience than reading it now with knowledge and experience.  Which way is better?  I can't say.<br /><br />Now I don't have writing skills comparable to any successful author, but Pullman does state that his series is aimed towards children, and it does occasionally show with some of the simpler content and writing.  Armored polar bears?  Well, I admit that I did become a fan of Iorek Byrnison by the end of the series.<br /><br />In my opinion, the best of the series is The Golden Compass.  The opening book creates an amazing fantasy world (with armored polar bears) that sucks the reader in.  There is no specific explanation for any of these wild images--the reader is simply let to believe that Pullman's creations, as wild as they are, are possible and even normal.<br /><br />The Subtle Knife continues the series, adding new characters and adventures, but not as powerfully as its predecessor.<br /><br />Although I think the finale The Amber Spyglass was a solid conclusion to the series, it wasn't as gripping as I thought the ending of this series would be.  The conclusion of Dust wasn't the amazing revelation that I had prepared myself for.  A little disappointing, but Phillip Pullman's His Dark Materials gets bumped up half a point for being a part of my childhood memories.<br /><br />Last summer I finished A Series of Unfortunate Events and this summer I followed it up with His Dark Materials.  Finishing these books from my childhood has been pretty satisfying.  Give old books a chance to be reread.  You'll be surprised at how much you missed the first time.<br /><br />9.5/10 -> 5/5s Dark Materials gets bumped up half a point for being a part of my childhood memories.

B009H442DG|1|Is this a \\"Saturday Night Live \\" skit? Travolta speaks/sings with no discernable talent. Even my grandmother, a forgiving Christian, would hate this. Newton-John and Travolta actually listened to this and let it be released anyway?
0131479415|4|Overall I think this is a good book. It provides a great overview of what everything you need to know to plan, estimate, and communicate progress on agile projects. The author seems to be well versed and his conversational style provides plenty of real world examples. My only negative to this book is that I thought it was a lot longer than necessary. I think the 22 chapters probably could have been condensed into about 15 chapters of actual content. The meet of the book is in the first 13 chapters after that it drags on a little bit. Still all in all it is a worthwhile read.
0312340958|5|Karen's voice rings out authentically; strong & true. Her constant battles with an archaic and illogical system and her role within it are intriguing as you enter into a hidden world that is as captivating as it is  perverse. Overall an incredible inside story of what it was like to become a nun in the 1960's. Insightful and introspective thoughts on religion & perhaps more importantly, humanity.
B0064X7FVE|1|Sure enjoyed the app as it was before all the  changes. Don't need all the pretty flowers, just obviously got too many people sitting around trying to trick it out.  How about tide tables?  Do you even respons Ron our reviews?

B004661J04|5|I gained a new appreciation for an old favorite when I attended a screenwriter's seminar taught by Robert McKee where the screenplay behind this masterpiece of the screen was examined in detail, bringing to light the metaphors and techniques that have made this a modern classic.  Watch this film again and again, and become surprised and delighted as metaphoric layers reveal themselves in the details of the film.

0061950726|5|I first heard about the orphan trains—the subject of Christina Baker Kline’s novel—back in the 1990’s on Unsolved Mysteries. On one episode, several elderly people were searching for long-lost siblings from whom they’d been separated when they were shepherded across the country on such trains as children. At the time, I’d been fascinated by the notion that orphaned and abandoned children would be taken from New York City and relocated to farms throughout the Midwest to join families who needed and (hopefully) wanted them, with the ultimate hope (but no guaranty) that they would bond with their new families and eventually be embraced and loved in their replacement homes.<br /><br />Heartbreaking in places, Orphan Train meshes gripping historical fiction with a moving Y-A/coming of age story. Amazingly, the author manages to pull off this unlikely pairing by interspersing historic chapters (which take place in the late 1920’s and ‘30’s) narrated in first person by the elderly Vivian when she was a girl, with present-day chapters narrated in third person from the point of view of the story’s 17-year-old protagonist, Molly, a foster child. The chapters don’t follow an even back-and-forth pattern, but skillfully and touchingly weave an interconnected saga of the past and present trials and tribulations of these two lost and largely unwanted souls. Though I was raised by two parents and enjoyed the comforts of a warm (if hellish) home, food in the fridge, and decent schooling in a respectable neighborhood, I could relate to the isolation and abandonment that befell these two main characters.<br /><br />Well-researched, socially significant, and emotionally moving on so many levels, Orphan Train is a nearly-spellbinding tale of a prototypical orphan’s early life on the plains; an expos&eacute; of primitive attitudes toward homeless children in general (which, based on Molly’s sad experience, may not have changed all that much in the intervening 80 years); and a testament to both the fortitude of the human spirit and the transformative power of personal conviction and love—the former a property that cannot be taken away no matter how grave the circumstances, and the latter an unstoppable force that somehow manages to find even the most wretched among us, if we are lucky (and our hearts remain open to it).<br /><br />Despite my curiosity about this historic topic, I was unprepared for how much I would love this book. Christina Baker Kline has produced an outstanding work of fiction truly deserving of five stars. Unlike so many novels that start off strong but falter by the mid-point, this marvelous, well-written gem had me engrossed from the very beginning and kept me riveted throughout. Orphan Train left me feeling both profoundly grateful for the stability I did enjoy in my formative years, while giving me renewed appreciation for my own accomplishments—and those of anyone who “makes it” on his or her own—in an oft-times cruel and indifferent world without any emotional or financial support from family.); and a testament to both the fortitude of the human spirit and the transformative power of personal conviction and love—the former a property that cannot be taken away no matter how grave the circumstances, and the latter an unstoppable force that somehow manages to find even the most wretched among us, if we are lucky (and our hearts remain open to it).<br /><br />Despite my curiosity about this historic topic, I was unprepared for how much I would love this book.

1611762529|5|Sue Monk Kidd is a well-established author and captures once again the trials and challenges during slavery. This compares the struggles of a black slave and her reluctant 11 year old owner both trying to forge their own futures. The mores of the times impact both girls differently, but are limiting none the less. Great author and all her books are a must read.
B0055PGUYU|5|Excellent book.<br />It makes you understand why you are unable to achieve certain things in life and the changes you need to make in yourself to achieve them
B004XJHBCE|5|Great app for anyone who runs custom ROMs.<br /><br />Android homescreen folders are not transferable between many custom ROM's.  But FolderOrganizer categories are - it remembers all of your App categories.<br /><br />Big added benefit: every time an app installs FolderOrganizer asks you (via the notification bar) to categorize it.  This will make it automatically appear in the Homescreen folder widget.<br /><br />Don't know how I lived without it!

B00J2PRBNS|1|I've really enjoyed some of Russell's earlier films (Seabiscuit, The Fighter), but this film was a total bore.  The only really engaging performance was by Jeremy Renner, who was totally overlooked in all the hoopla about this picture.

B00012QM8G|5|The movie Schindler's List is mainly about a man named Oskar Schindler. He comes to town to try to become rich making army supplies for the German armies. Using bribes he eventually gains access to a factory and a lot of other things in order to run it. Schindler hires Jews to work in his factory and documents are falsified so as many Jews as possible are saved from being sent to the death camp. After a new camp is finished however an order goes out to eliminate the remaining Jews in the area and after witnessing a horrible massacre Schindler dedicates the majority of his wealth to trying to protect the Jewish people who work at his factories. He intends to get them out of the country but there is a mix up that ends up with him having to bribe people at Auschwitz to get some of the people that were on his list that were sent there mistakenly. He ends up saving them as well as rescuing some of the children that were at the camp as well. He manages to keep people alive by continually bribing officials and eventually runs through his entire fortune. After the war Schindler has to leave because he was being hunted by the Russian army for war crimes he was not guilty of. The end of the film shows the Jewish people who worked at Schindler's factory placing stones on his grave as a sign of great respect for what he did for them.    This movie displays many important concepts in many different religions. The main one that I can think of is the major theme of helping your fellow man that resonates in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Muslims are supposed to donate money to charities as one of their pillars of faith and Schindler gave up his entire fortune to try and keep the factory workers safe. He also respected the faith of the people that worked there and went out of his way to save as many people as he could.

B00003IPFK|4|It's difficult to bring an excellent 500 page novel to the screen, but Lonesome Dove comes pretty darn close.  My suggestion is to read the book, digest it for a month or two and then watch this mini-series.  Duvall &amp; Tommy Lee Jones are perfect as Gus &amp; Call.  The scenes are faithful to the book.  The soundtrack is breathtaking.  The one weak spot is the casting Frederic Forrest (an otherwise very capable actor)as Blue Duck.  He does not bring the menace that was so haunting in the novel.  Otherwise it's a great flick!
B00003CXCT|4|I'm really not sure I want to purchase these DVDs. Everyone needs to own them if they've ever liked the series, of course. The movies are instant classics for adults and children alike. But I'm just not convinced I want to buy these, as they are not the pure, original theatrical versions. Instead, they are the blashemed \\"Special Edition\\" versions released a few years ago on VHS. The Special Editions changed a lot of fundamentals of the trilogy. The worst crime is changing the famous showdown in the bar between the rugged Han Solo and Greedo the bounty hunter; Lucas felt it made Solo too much of a bad guy to have him shoot Greedo first, so a badly re-edited version was put in the Special Edition where Greedo shoots first. Not only does it look horrible, it changes the essence of one of the best characters. This is where my conflict brews: should I purchase this edition or boycott it until Lucas puts the original, classic versions out on DVD?

B00000JR29|5|For many TFF fans, The Big Chair album will be forever remembered for it's giant hits 'Shout' and Everybody Wants To Rule The World' as well as the lesser number 3 hit 'Head Over Heels'.<br />For me while Shout and Everybody Wants To Rule The World are some of the best songs the 80s had to offer, this album has far more to offer than just those two songs alone. I enjoy the parent album versions of Shout and EWTRTW more than the shortened versions that have often appeared on many 80s compilations. I hate when they shorten the great Shout to only 4 minutes. It decreases it's listenability. On the other hand I love the 6 and a half minute version far more.<br />While Shout and EWTRTW are absolute classics, I often find myself listening to a lot of the other songs on this album more than those two major hits. For example, The Working Hour is in my opinion an incredible song with a strong disturbing melody filled with passion that burns like fire and radiates more emotion and talent with the first few notes of the synthesizers alone than anything that most of todays throwaway artist exhibit on their entire albums. The Working Hour is one of the best songs TFF have ever composed and is one of the major highlights.<br />The song Head Over Heels is a rich and powerful song. The version on the Tears Roll Down and Shout: Very Best Of TFF CDs ends with just the voice echoing away. On The Big Chair LP, the ending merges with a live performance of Broken that greatly increases it;s listening capibility. It ends with the sound of a crowd cheering ushering in Listen. Listen is a very ominous song with almost apocolyptic lyrics and a dark, brooding atmosphere and thundering beats that sends chills through me during every listen.<br />The version of The Big Chair I,m reviewing is the remastered version. The original version realeased in February of 1985 had only eight tracks. The remastered edition features seven bonus tracks for an even greater spectrum of TFFs incredible talent. The first three bonus The Big Chair, The Maurauders, and Empire Building, tracks are also available on the B-Sides Rarities collection Saturnine Martial Lunatic. These are moslty quirky instrumentals that casual fans might not enjoy too much but for me, I love every second of them. The Conflict is a song that was previously unreleased. It's a cool song with almost Phil Collins-like beats and bizarre electronic blips. The other three bonus tracks are remixes. Broken Revistited is longer than the original version although less powerful and not as heavy but still great.<br />The remix of Mothers Talk was the hit version, not the heavier parent album version. I love both versions. The remix version is more jazzy and not quite as aggressive. The U.S. remix of Shout is an eight minute mix that is great. Although it does not do the original version justice at least this is like a good reworking of the song.<br />I,m so glad I got the remastered version of this CD. In fact I have all three of TFFs first three albums remastered.<br />For all fans of 80s music get this incredible CD. I would recommend the Remastered edition more because it's almost twice as long as the 1985 version and with 15 tracks instead of just 8.<br />This is definately one of the best albums of the 20th Century. Don't stop there get the Seeds Of Love next. You'll be surprised at the difference between these two masterpieces. Get The Hurting as well but get the Big Chair and Seeds Of Love. Grrrrrr... Just get every TFF CD. They are all worth owning.t.

B005D9MUWY|5|I've tried a lot of keyboards for Android. Besides all the stock or AOSP ones including Jellybean 4.2's swype-like one and at least one that used to be my favorite because it worked well on the Incredible's retarded little brother the Eris (underpowered). There are several others like Swype, which I've never understood that it got enough attention to get included in stock ROMs, Ultra Keyboard, a few others. They all are lacking little features that SwiftKey is not.<br /><br />It is the bomb and unless they screw up, it is the end all of what typists look for in touch keyboards. My fianc&eacute; loves it, too!<br /><br />You won't be sorry.
0739321005|3|listening to this audio book in my car created an intense curiosity to understand barack more. although this book is somewhat inspiring ,it truly reads like a long,drawn out novel at times giving too much information in one direction ,but not enough in others. of course I realize that it is incomplete, maybe I feel like the author jumped the gun to create this too soon. At certain points it feels rushed,then again It can appear evasive.. some chapters were entirely too verbose and I needed and auditory break.

B00VFTCGES|1|Ludicrous, pretentious, sophomoric...but laugh-out-loud funny!  Here are the &#34;can't miss&#34; things you'll want to make sure you see.  1. Anne Hathaway--a scientist and astronaut--explaining how maybe, just maybe, love may be the fifth dimension!  2.  Somebody in the future sending signals back to the present by using Morse Code signals in gravitational waves!  3.  Matthew McConaughey returning from space about 50 years after he left it and jumping into/stealing a little &#34;land-speeder&#34; kit of jitney to go find Hathaway on the other side of the universe!  4.  The astronaut team flying their little space ship through a &#34;wormhole&#34; and then using the gravitational pull of a black hole to &#34;sling shot&#34; their craft into another dimension!  5.  The last crop of okra!  Yes, I know these all sound unbelievable, but this is just the beginning.  I chit you not!  And, don't get me started on the tessaract!  This is a movie made by Hollywood folks who love to pretend they are smarter than they actually are, but the results belie that notion.  Try to imagine the &#34;pitch&#34; meeting for this dog, with all the heads nodding in abeyance to the director and stars, and meanwhile no one tells the emperor that he doesn't have any clothes on!  But...honestly...a barrel of laughs!!!

B0015HOFZI|1|This turntable has so much potential, to bad Sony don't know customer service.Lets review, The software sometimes does not divide the tracks. There is nothing I could find in the software or the on line users manual to change a setting to enhance this. I did, on my own, discover a way to manually create regions (track divisions) and save each track individually. This was time consuming, but effective. I had trouble with the volume of the playback on one album, I re-recorded it many times, adjusting recording levels, experimenting with several options on the menu bar to no avail. I truely believe the software is probably capable of fixing many of the problems that I had but we will never know. I went to the Sony web sight and sent them several inquiries on the problems I was having and seeing how I read everything possible I could find and the only help I got was from me and the hours I spent trying different things. Sony has a phone number where you can purchase the ability to talk to a customer service rep. Gee thanks, I just purchase your product and you want me to pay you to tell me how to use it. I find their lack of attentiveness a breach of the purchasing contract entered between a consumer and a manufacturer. I know I should have known this would have been a problem since so many others had said the same of Sony in their reviews. I watched my 30 days and exercised my return option with Amazon. I can not say enough about Amazon. They were very professional. They could sure teach Sony a little about customer service.
B003JTHXOK|4|I loved it! I would recommend it to others. It's kind of hard to stop reading the book when you get further into the reading all though I must admit I kept waiting for the sex scene and it never never happened. Other than that it was exciting!

B000069AUI|2|Friends had repeatedly told me that I would like Coldplay.  So I picked up this and \\"Parachutes\\" at a budget price.  I've played each a few times now, but have failed to connect with the band.  I like music that makes me feel something, connects with my emotions.  For example, \\"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\\" just seems to drone on with the pounding piano, but it doesn't make me feel much.  Perhaps I don't connect with the lead singer.  I like the style of the music.  \\"The Scientist\\" is supposed to be one of their best songs, but the vocals seem sterile to me.  I feel nothing when the singer croons, \\"Nobody said it was easy; it's such a shame for us to part.\\"  It should be a heartbreak, but it's merely pleasant.  \\"Clocks\\" is a bright spot, an interesting track, \\"I am a part of your disease.\\"  \\"Daylight\\" sounds a bit like the Beatles' \\"Within You, Without You\\" from \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" mixed with the Beach Boys, but seems repetitive as all the lyricist can come up with is \\"slowly breaking through the daylight\\" that gets sung about 25 times in repetition.  I suppose it's supposed to be profound more than redundant.  You can listen to a few bars of \\"Whisper\\" and turn the track off, because they're just going to do the same thing over & over.  \\"Amsterdam\\" is a wonderful place.  I like the song Janis Ian wrote about it better than this one.  The singer croons on the sad track, \\"I swear I waited and waited to get out of this hole.\\"  Unfortunately, he doesn't.  Solve Sundsbo's cover artwork is very nice.  Perhaps.

When you watch it with someone who has never seen it before and they get to the end, what a joy to see them whoop in excitement.

B002962RKE|5|Since Glee started I had friends trying to get me to watch it and I kept saying no because I had already missed the first season.  I happened to be checking out what shows were available through Prime Instant Video and they had all 4 seasons.  So I watched season one and I am totally hooked.  I love the musical style and the cast does a great job with the songs they cover.  The stories happening between the casts are not as exciting but they are improving as the seasons go by.

B00004RIUV|3|If you check out the cover art for this David Geffen sponsored release, you will see the improbable sight of Gene Clark wearing makeup.  Take that as a warning.  This record is wildly overproduced.  <br />\\"From a Silver Phial\\" is flat-out fantastic.  But, tellingly, it is the shortest track on this album.  \\"Strength of Strings\\" is a great Clark opus but the arrangement is far too long at six and a half minutes.  \\"Life's Greatest Fool\\" is entertaining with its odd gospel backup singers.  \\"No Other\\" (the song) sounds like an effort by Clark to stretch himself musically but it doesn't really work.  \\"Some Misunderstanding\\" is plodding;  it's a bit like a mean parody of Gene Clark's work.  <br />I differ with the other writers here. This is not a great album, but the good stuff is very much worth having.  The excesses remind me that this comes from the era and the town that gave David Bowie and John Lennon their worst years in terms of mental health (drugs, drugs, drugs) and is not too long after Gram Parsons expired for the same reason.  Thank God the same demons weren't yet destined to take Gene from us.
1582406723|4|I think some of the pleasure of reading this graphic novel was taken away from watching the first two seasons of the TV series. There obviously weren't that many surprises and I would say 75% of the graphic novel was like several of the episodes. Without giving spoilers I'd say certain parts of the TV series were better. Probably because they built on the comic which came first. Then again, some instances of the graphic novel were better than the series so I don't feel I'm biased towards one or the other.<br /><br />Anyway, this tale focuses upon a police officer (Rick Grimes) who gets shot, goes into a coma at the hospital and awakens to discover a zombie apocalypse. He then makes his way to survivors and the rest of the tale is about survival sprinkled with moral decisions.<br /><br />From Wiki: \\"The Walking Dead received the 2010 Eisner Award for Best Continuing Series at San Diego Comic-Con International. The series was adapted into the AMC television series The Walking Dead, which premiered in 2010. The television program has inspired a Kirkman-approved full length novel prologuing the comic book's timeline. The series has been translated into numerous languages such as Danish, Portuguese, Spanish, Serbian, Polish, French, Turkish and Japanese.\\"<br /><br />Written by Robert Kirkman with black and white panels by Tony Moore.<br /><br />ARTWORK PRESENTATION: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; HORROR THEMES/FOCUSES: B;  STORY/PLOTTING: B; WHEN READ: early September 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B.<br /><br />SPOILERS: I liked it when Rick escaped from the zombies in the city going underneath the tank and up the hole. I also liked that one of the dead men within came to life suddenly and he used his gun and hurt himself with the gunshot. The killing of Shane so easily, well, I think the series milked it for a longer period of time. Rick's fears are demonstrated visually far better in the graphic novels than the series though I suspect too much fear would have turned theTV masses off.
B00FEMJF6O|5|Good way to pass time
B00DF0POXA|5|The production of this album is BEYOND amazing!  New sound!  Fresh lyrics - not to mention some pretty controversial stuff, but I don't expect anything less from Kanye!!
B007SGM084|5|I just love this trilogy. I only wish that she would finish what she started at the end and continue the series by writing them in Christians view point. I would love to be able to see what Christian was thinking through the series.
B0009WFFS6|5|Sound and vision of the DVD is fantastic. EC proves he is the best blues guitarplayer in the world. Jack and Ginger are still a driving force.  <br />Favourites: Too many but stands out: Spoonful, Storming Monday, Sleepy time, we'r going wrong. <br />
B005LAIHPE|5|This movie came to me in very good condition.This is a great war movie with aliens trying to take over the World.When I first recieved this movie it stopped part way into it and I tried to play it in both of my DVD's and it stopped in both of them.I called Amazon and explained the trouble I was having and the Vender sent me a e-mail telling me that they were sending me a replacement for the one I was having trouble with and they was also sending me a envelope to send them back the one that was not working as it should.The new movie arrived in two days and I sent them back the first one that I recieved.I am very satisfied with the way this vender handled my problem.I would buy from them again.
B00IU0M85C|5|You have to watch this!
B00B8M4IMK|5|Using it mainly to charge my HTC One in the car, plus a spare port for anyone sitting besides me that needs some juice.<br />It's quite small, unobtrusive. Charges my device faster than the original HTC charger.<br /><br />Note, that if you live in a sunny/hot country, and your phone is on the windshield, the phone will start getting warm and will charge slower to protect the battery.
6303022901|5|I've watched this movie many times - it still makes me cry....
B004DI7HZ6|5|LIke reading an adult Harry Potter....I loved it.  Interesting and different ideas.  Solid characters.  Well written.  Second book not quiet as good but awaiting the third book with excitement.
B00DPM7RJW|5|I really wasn't sure if I would like this book or not, having read Colleen Hoover's Slammed series and not being able to finish the first book. I am so happy I took a chance on Maybe Someday. This book was soooo good that I would not go to bed until I finished it. I also really enjoyed that the man--Ridge--was not your typical perfect hero. He's deaf but that doesn't stop Sydney from falling from him. They start out as neighbors. She knows he plays guitar every night out on the patio and makes it a point to go out on her patio to listen to him. When Sydney finds out her boyfriend of two years is cheating on her with her best friend, her world is thrown into chaos. With nowhere to live, Ridge invites her into his apartment and she becomes his roommate with two other people. Sydney begins helping Ridge with writing music and they slowly fall for each other. The problem is, Ridge has a girlfriend who he's been dating for five years. This book as such an emotional roller-coaster. I really had no clue how this love triangle would turn out. I loved the maturity of how everyone handled things in the book and being able to actually listen to the songs they wrote. How cool is it that a book has its own soundtrack!
B00006JKON|5|My first Jethro Tull Concert was The War Child concert.  It was incredible!!!!  I was truly amazed!  I wore out my vinyl LP long ago.  My 30+ year old cassettes are getting there, too.  It was time to replace the LP.  As a side note, I enjoy Jethro Tull music so much I named my sons after members of the band.
B0071XO8RA|5|Fantastic story. I always savor the last chapter of a book that I am enjoying and Wool was no exception! I can't wait to see the movie and the read the other stories about silo life. Thank you for the good I mean great read. -Bruce
0446310786|5|This is one of the great contemporary books.  It is one of the very few books that can be read at any age or stage of life.  Many relationships, stereotypes, attitudes, personalities are presented in a simple straightforward manner.  This book makes you think.
B0030IIYYS|4|The Grandkids love it.

B00C7TAF3Y|4|Well done puzzle and it keeps your interest without becoming boring.  The clues are just enough without giving it away.
B00HPYMVD8|5|Pulsating book and unputdownable. Many climaxes. Would be great movie, if this book is made into a movie with good screen play.
B00N1JQ452|5|great movie and great price
B00BETX5PS|5|Awesome from beginning to end. Stays true to the 007 theme. I can watch this movie over and over again
B000JMKTLO|5|Couldn't put it down, you can see these characters in your head as clear as day,like you  have already met them.
B00GEEB730|5|Heart warming story.
B00DHQHAH0|5|Again, Before I started watching the show I thought it would be boring and a waste of time.  I took a risk, watched an episode, and was hooked.  It's funny, ruthless, serious all rolled into one.  I'm waiting for Season 4 to come out on Prime.  Hurry up!  Great TV Series.
B00GM123CY|5|i love this movie i have watched it over 100 times and would watch again and again
B0054TKAZW|5|This show is pretty great! It's like a toned down but still suspenseful and entertaining Supernatural for teens. 5 out of 5!
B00Y6QF0PE|5|Once again, EL James rocked it!!!! FSOG got me back into reading and I can't say how grateful I am for these books. This trilogy isn't about abuse or control. If you truly read these stories you'd know and understand why Christian went through what he did and why he acted so strong.<br />There's a love story in there but you have to allow your mind to dig deep in each chapter. Otherwise you're going to assume it's about abuse and rape and whatever BS theory the naysayers blab about.<br />I personally enjoyed digging into Christian's head and finally hearing his thoughts. Why some people thought it was going to be different and practically another story is beyond me.<br /><br />Kudos to the author! I can't wait for more!
B007TBZ63Y|5|I have read all the Percy Jackson books since the beginning and written reports for school on three of them. And now Riordan has left us (PJ lovers) with Annabeth and Percy falling into Tatarus?? I could scream!
B008J5T4Q4|5|Artist \\"Pink\\" and the music are great and even after purchasing the CD, this treasure in a modern LP is a genuine treasure.<br /><br />I purchased two, one is unsealed, mounted on my office wall along with other musical highlights from concert performances;  Just eh unexpectedness of finding and artist that cares enough to put her songs on an old-fashoned LP is beyond my expectations.  The quality is amazing and the packaging that Amazon provides for LP's is perfect, that I doubt they have ever had a return due to shipping.<br /><br />Thank you Pink for thinking of us collectors, would recommend this to any fan that wants a current piece of history.<br /><br />Full, 5 stars for everything.<br /><br />t
B009UX2YAC|5|Hey ,If your someone who liked Temple Run but instantly got bored, well I know how you feel! This game is addicting fun and never gets old! Its people are cool and its boosts well except Super Sneakers! Its a great app to do when your bored or in the car or looking for something to do. I love it, and you probably will too! I l recommend  this game to everyone!

0395389496|5|One of the truly beautiful Christmas stories...and even better and simpler than its film counterpart.
0061122416|4|IT was a great spiritual adventure.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Very fun game.
B0015OKWL2|3|Deniro & Pacino, the two exceptional actors that ignited my passion for cinema.  You know it's a sad day in showbiz when you pair these two up and still can't arouse much excitement.<br /><br />The premise is actually pretty cool.  Deniro is the cop serial killer, and Pacino is his partner that turns the other cheek.<br />Both these veteran actors deliver solid performances, but nothing special.  It's like they're on cruise control, nothing meaty in the script to pull the best out of them.<br /><br />Still it's scary to think of the power a police officer wields, and how in some regards they are exempt from the very laws they try to enforce.<br />It's hard to feel any contempt or discomfort for the cop that puts a bullet in the head of a rapist or pedaphile priest.  The line between evil and righteousness gets blurred, and few want to focus on sorting things out.<br /><br />The story progresses with some decent action scenes and interesting developments.  The biggest downside of this movie is without a doubt the ending.  Hollywood always deems it mandatory to throw in an absolutely shocking, retarded ending.  Yeah, they fooled us the first 2000 times.  So, for about the last hour you'll feel like a deer in headlights, as that H-wood vehicle comes barreling down the road of absurdity.<br /><br />Now a truly shocking ending would be a realistic one.  We'd never see that coming.
B00BAXFECK|1|Way too long, too much repetition, shallow characters, and LOOSE ENDS. I just kept flipping pages thinking there must be a point here somewhere. Very boring, long, over-rated book in my humble opinion.
B008JFUO72|5|Good
B000FVQYYK|5|I have been a fan of Muse through the years and their progression to this lastest album keeps up the high standard of music Muse has always been able to acheive. A must have for Muse fans and a great album for anyone wanting to hear something special.
B00SYTTBMC|5|astonishing!  love the sweet juxtaposed with the anguished howl.
0060887966|5|One of my most favorite books if not THE favorite book. I was going through a challenging time and a friend recommended that I read this book. This book is just full of so much profound meaning and inspiration. I don't want to divulge any spoilers but it's basically about a boy on his journey to the meaning of life and what he's meant to be and do. This book can apply to anyone, anywhere. I have bought this book as gifts for friends and they all absolutely loved it. Great for all ages too!
1742204120|4|We're going to India in two months and found Lonely Planet India to be an excellent guide for planning our itinerary while there. It's packed full of helpful information.
B003TNQEF0|5|Fantastic movie and mind blowing ending
B00008FBDE|3|I must admit that when I first saw this movie, I marveled at the then incredible effects and cinematography.  It involved a story that was unique and piqued my interest as I've often marveled at the civilizations of ancient Egypt and the Great Pyramid.<br />Altho I did thuroughly enjoy this flick, I certainly don't think it's worth the $1,918.98 list price even WITH the free shipping.  It's not even the DVD format version!<br />All in all, save your money and wait for it to be shown on the TNT network again.
B00JT6OWZA|5|The variety of puzzles and hidden objects keeps me from getting bored. Challenging but not hard enough to get me frustrated. I like it.
B00006J9OV|5|The one and only authentic DVD performance of this arguably greatest work in all art, not just in opera and not just in music.  Avoid the newer Met performance with Jonas Kauffmann, as well as all the other Regietheater junk.
B00124JGSK|5|Wow, I'm so fortunate that I came across this album.  You really need to hear the entire album to appreciate what a wonderful work it is.  Just 30 second samples can't do it justice.  Also, I know some people refer to this as Gene Clark's Sgt Pepper album, but I don't know if that quite fits.  It's not like you're going to hear any avant-garde psychedelia.  It's more tastefully experimental.  Let's start with &#34;Life's Greatest Fool&#34;, the first song.  It starts off sounding like a typical country song as Clark sings about what it means to be human (always thoughtful, that Mr. Clark), and just as it gets to the chorus, the bass gets all rockabilly and then a gospel choir adds in some fire and all of a sudden the song is a different beast altogether.  Then there's the title track which has this warmly distorted guitar (or is it a synth?) that colors the track rather nicely.  This album is a magnificently crafted and intelligent album that you really need to hear.  It really makes me wish Gene Clark was still around to make more music, but at least this survived.
B006UKFFE0|5|If you read one book on entrepreneurship, let this be it.  It summarizes a lot of the 'best' ideas in entrepreneurship (Steve Blank, Eric Ries, others) and gives you a very practical guide to getting started.  At one point in the past, it would have been possible to 'push' a product onto users.  Now, unless you are a company like Apple it is almost impossible.  There are thousands of other start-ups that will do what you do AND listen to users.<br /><br />The idea of systematically de-risking your business idea is a powerful way to get up and running with the smallest amount of money possible.  If you have a business idea but you're not sure whether it's viable, Ash will give you a step by step plan for bringing it from the canvas to making money.<br /><br />As another positive, the author seems to genuinely be interested in engaging with people who read the book.  If this book doesn't answer a question you have, you could probably ask him.  That's pretty good value for a book.
B008IJT0CE|5|I have had ringing in my ears for as long as I can remember and because of that I have had problems sleeping for just as long. I made my own combination of sounds (and was able to save it) that zeros out the ringing and allows me to fall asleep much faster than I have in YEARS.
B006PIXKVW|5|A classic
B00HJ957BC|2|This movie lacked a plot and ending. It was just one problem after another and some how she over came each one. It was very unrealistic.
B000067J1Q|3|First off. Think you have seen the Sound of Music? Well you haven't. I thought I had, many times. Of course it was always around Xmas with the commerical breaks. But that is a much edited version. There are small but significant cuts everywhere in that version. So this is a great thing to have. My 3 stars relates directly to the lack of extras on the one disc. The movie is 5+ stars, but the lack of extras warrants the 3 stars.<br />So this is a must buy. Also the commentary is very good here. But given the price for this on Amazon, just buy the 2 set version. I got the one disc version at a very good price so it is not a bad buy. But for $6 more, why not enjoy the double DVD? This is a must get for any movie fan, and if you are not into the extras, by all means buy this one. This movie, like all of Rogers and Hammerstein's work is emotional without ever being fake or sentimental. It is full of sentiment and completely honest sentiment at that, but never sentimentality. It totally puts to SHAME almost every director and producer and writer working in Hollywood today. Complete and total shame and disgrace. Nothing coming out of Hollywood today can hold a candle to this. Entire director's careers with academy awards can't even begin to even compare to just this one movie. So get some version, especially if you have young ones. Sit them down, and let them experience what a real movie can be.
006202406X|1|I haven't written a review before, but I decided to because I've never been more pissed off by a series ending.  I won't reiterate what so many other one-star reviewers have so expertly outlined as the core issues with the writing, choices and character development, but what I will say is that I felt like I was reading a completely different author in book 3.  Crappiest story turns and endings in a long, long time and after hundreds of books I've read.  Will definitely be avoiding the movie and all future writing from her.  I wish she burned this book, pretended like it never happened, started over and created something worthy of her original creation.
B000XUBFE2|4|I loved the final story but took a while to get into it. But it was intriguing once the action got going. I loved that child and her<br />adult thinking, but what struggles those families had to endure left me wondering about my own future.
B003XF1XOQ|5|I usually don't read trilogy's... But I was caught up with this one!! Wonderful book! Can't wait for the movie!!
B0015DYIH2|5|I don`t understand why there were so many negative reviews for this book. It was the best  possible ending to the great Twilight Saga! In this book Bella and Edward are finally together... FOREVER. I recommend this book to any reader!
B00DYOOGYK|5|This app is very fun but It is VERY slow. But its the best app ever it's just like grand theft auto. How ever this app says bad words you  can rob banks strip clubs but if your not allowed to see strippers you should not get this app but it's the best app in the WORLD.
B00AB7HESI|1|controls nonresponsive.  tutorial not complete. gameplay not intuitive. totally not fun.<br /><br />maybe for 7-11 year Olds.  avatar change not reflected in text.
B00RVBY8KO|5|I really enjoyed this movie. It about real life and how relationships evolve over time. Terrific acting. Thought about it long after it was over.
B008XG1X18|5|I work at a day care, and I go to pinterest on my Kindle Fire and look for crafts ideas, it is amazing the stuff that I find. LOVE IT.
B00V4JJFN4|4|It was predictable and slow at times but overall very entertaining. Lots of action.
B009ZQC7MY|5|Have enjoyed this series and looking forward to next installment.  The actors are great, nice background scenery.<br /><br />Would like to known more about the actors, guess I should do internet research.
B008TRUDAS|5|Wow! Loved this book! I usually hate books where there is instant love. Instant attraction, yes, but not instant love. Rest assured for those of you who are like me, the drama soon begins and it becomes heated.<br /><br />Other reviewers have already left enough details I'm sure, but I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed this book. So much substance. The poetry the author incorporates to convey feelings is amazing. I laughed at the Chuck Norris jokes, cried for Eddie, and stayed up very late to see how the romance panned out. Well done!
B00WWUD62U|5|Awesome soundtrack! Another Giacchino masterpiece.
B009F879HK|5|I am Beatlemaniac and this product besides being the history of rock n roll was the soundtrack of my life.
B003MYYJD0|5|I really like this watch
0525953094|5|Wish his books were even longer. The reader gets to know the characters, seeing history through their eyes. Great perspective of the civil rights movement. This is a wonderful series of 3 books.
B008602KQI|5|I waited forever to see this. I've read the trilogy and the movie was good. Not outstanding...but good. As is always the case, there were changes from the book but nothing severe and all was acceptable.

B000002L68|5|great
B00H58VGIA|5|I never wanted this story to end . The transformation of Sarah, the privileged  slave owner was fascinating as was the backdrop of the struggle the country was going through over the issue of slavery. There were no cliches and the characters were multilayered. Hettie , the slave girl, was equally interesting as the story shifts narrators and the cruel practices of slavery are shared first hand. Some of the descriptions are horrific but the reality of what the slaves endured is otherwise unimaginable. Will read this again for it's rich in detail about not only the struggle for freedom for the slaves but also the battle to be your own person despite societies' expectations of how your role is defined. Wonder, excellent book.
B008JFUS0U|5|Chris Hemsworth is worthy to play the part of Thor. I can't imagine anyone else playing the God of Thunder. Likewise, Tom Hiddleston IS Loki, a living, breathing Trickster god. Those roles are set in stone in my mind; the others can come and go (OK, not Darcy or Selvig).<br /><br />A double dose of pure menace is present; along with Loki, there is Christopher Eccleston, who has played many larger than life roles, such as the Duke of Norfolk in Elizabeth, Major Henry West in 28 Days Later, Destro in GI Joe, and in the science fiction mega-classic Doctor Who as the Doctor. Eccleston exudes pure hatred as Malekith the Accursed. One can never be certain just what a megalomaniacal despot will do next, and Eccleston has the right bearing to make it all spine-chillingly creepy.<br /><br />The story is solid, the CGI and stunts mix flawlessly, and the superb acting make this movie a must-see.
B000N6TYLW|2|Gilmore Girls has been one of my all time favorite shows.  I loved the witty language and banter and just the whole plot line.  However, I was upset with this season.  A lot of the fire was gone from the show and I just could never see where the show was going.  I imagine it would have been 10 times better if Amy Palladino had stayed with the show if her demands had been met.  My least favorite episode probably was the last.  After Logan proposes you hear absolutely nothing about what happened except Rory said no.  I loved those two together.  The only good thing about the whole season was that Lorelai and Luke got back together.
B005KJJ4F8|4|A very creative take on an old story concept. It is similar to The Looking Glass Wars in the way it retains the bare bones of the original story, yet makes a fresh and utterly new world from them.
1451695195|4|I thought the book a little wordy, but overall a good read.
0783221487|4|Just a good scifi film. A little weird, but good!
B009AMANBA|5|This is an excellent movie and one of the best I've seen in a long time. I hope everyone has a chance to watch it.
B0094BB4TW|5|Love it. Easy to use. No bug or complications saves me lots of time so I don't have to get on the computer
B00004TJWE|4|I'd heard so much about this album and eventually decided to buy it. I can hear how it influenced Pete Townshend with Tommy but there are a ton of references from other artists contained within various lyrics on this recording. Of course Beatle references abound as they pretty much permeated society at that time.<br /><br />I wouldn't say this is an essential recording to own but it does have some fantastic moments.
B00BD99JMW|5|This series of books was recommended to me by an eight-year old daughter of a good friend of mine. There are no words to describe the feeling of reading this story. I was fascinated with the story development. I only got this feeling from &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; series which I see both scenarios happening with our society if we do not start paying attention to the subtle changes that could land us in a similar situation. The whole series affected me deeply and the ending was perfect! I applaud Veronica Roth for a timeless series. This should be must read for schools - it definitely would spark some interesting discussion!
B006LSZECO|5|I literally could not put the book down! Great story!
B00C1BU7V8|3|I think the movie did a fine job explaining how difficult it was passing the 13th Amendment, but I try not to read the synopsis when a title is as specific as this one was. So, I expected more of biography.
B0015ABRE2|5|Dexter season 3 definitely tops the first and second seasons, which were also amazing!  I didn't read anything about this season, and the season took a direction I never expected after seeing the first two episodes.  Hope it continues to get better and better...already got season 4 too, and can't wait to start them!
B0024NSG34|3|The second installment in the Harry Potter series has some fun moments. I love the character of Gilderoy Lockhart. He's well played and adds humor to the movie. Hagrid's character also gets some more development.     I'm not as crazy about the plot. It's a bit too convoluted, and much of it is never really explained well (even after watching \\"Half-Blood Prince,\\" I still don't understand how Voldemort could have controlled Ginny Weasley or lived through a book). Dobby was really annoying. He's way too dramatic and a sadomasochist to boot. Would anybody really believe that programming a ball to attack and almost kill Harry Potter was really going to succeed in keeping him away from Hogwarts? It just doesn't add up.     Also, the basilisk and spiders were somewhat disappointing and pretty dull. The spiders aren't as exciting as Shelob in Lord of the Rings. The basilisk was somewhat believable, but sometimes looked like a big movie prop. Maybe a special edition could be released with better monster designs.     Overall, this is probably tied with \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" as my least favorite in the series. It's definitely worth watching if you like the Harry Potter movies, but should have been much better.
B008Y768XO|4|We thoroughly enjoyed this movie which was both happy and sad.  If you are a dog lover you will enjoy this movie.
0307276902|5|Despite all the hype about this book being based on a true story and Frey not being an addict, this is a VERY good book. It is no wonder Oprah added this to her book club!
B005D9MUWY|1|This app used to be amazing, since they upgraded it my predictive text only gives punctuation and the flow doesn't work at all on my htc.  Also their support is basically nil.
0743201140|5|My company uses these books with almost all employees, and they have been very effective in developing staff and leaders within the firm.
B0099RFVXQ|5|Brings together all the players as Avengers to save the day from Earth Invaders from a different Realm.  Great Special effects and good writers with actors that seem to act as a team!
B00GIXY4M8|5|It's Hugh Jackman!
B000N5F6OW|5|The stunts are excellent.  The story is interesting, but in parts corny.  The camera work is also excellent.
B00HDMMISA|5|Good read; I have enjoyed every Liane Moriarty book I have read.
B007FRHZ4A|3|I'll start with a word on the \\"game play\\" of this game.  It stinks.  In fact, \\"game play\\" is in quotes because it's really not even a game.  At least not for my family.  We've had every set of these and this is the most difficult to actually build with because of the shape and unevenness of the blocks.  And the catapult has not been improved in any version, so it remains incapable of accurately launching anything.  But, to be honest, we don't have all the sets to play them as a game.  My son just loves to build random structures with these blocks, legos, pillows, plush toys - you name it really.  The little figures are great and they are the draw for my son.  This is more like an \\"add-on\\" set to build more structures with.  As I mentioned, this set is not the easiest to build with, but in combination with other, FLATTER, blocks, he can create elaborate \\"levels\\" to knock down.  Overall, I'd say, if your kid is an Angry Bird nut they will enjoy this and get use out of it.  If you are looking for a fun family game, this probably doesn't meet that need.
0345442970|5|I'm a huge fan of the Star Wars movies and I was hungry to learn more about the worlds, characters, species, and interim events of this spectacular epic. So, I started reading the novels in chronological order, beginning with Cloak of Deception. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br />Although I believe anyone can enjoy this novel, knowing the movies in and out makes reading this that much better. I was pleased to see the author delve into Chancellor Valorum's background, and describe what events occurred that eventually led to his political demise. Plus, to see how Senator Palpatine won the hearts and commitment from other members of the Galactic Senate made his meteoric rise to power in Episode I make that much more sense. And I couldn't help but smile when the dubious Wilhuff Tarkin was introduced into the mix of things. I could go on and on, but I don't want to give too much away. <br /> <br />In short, if you are a person who loves Star Wars, likes novels centered around politics, or just digs a good adventure, read Cloak of Deception. I couldn't put it down, and I'd be willing to bet that you won't be able to either. May the Force be with you!
B008JGSM6G|2|I actually downloaded this for my kids to play and I have played it once or twice.  okay if you need to pass a few minutes but gets boring pretty fast.
B0011UBDTK|5|I love Sex in The City , and adding thies few episodes i had not seen i am so glad i got this for me .
B004SBS8LA|5|Like every other Birds game, this is great! Enough levels easy enough to keep going and other levels difficult enough to frustrate me!
B00BWJ7LYG|4|I wish I would've read the books before heading down the Hobbit hole (and the LOTR trilogy). While, as with the Fellowship of the Ring, it may start out slow, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey does not disappoint! Also, as with the first in the LOTR series, it whets your appetite just enough, and leaves you wanting more...
0440245915|5|John Grisham has an easy and relatable writing style and a great knack for telling stories. Excellent book ... now on to Sycamore Row ..
B008XG1X18|5|Great
B007J4T2G8|3|This book gives good insight to the dominant, submissive relationship. The author must have had a relationship like that, minus the love part (on Christians side) it's very close to the real thing.
B000001Y2U|5|In my opinion, one of the ballsiest, important and most conceptually brilliant albums I have heard. Marilyn Manson started out as a shock, vaudevillian Florida band, but with this album brought great maturity and the surprise of the American audience. It is said that in order to get people's attention, one must do it with a scream, and that's what this album did targeting closed-minded right-wing Christian America as the enemy. In doing this, Manson used a biblical-like storyline, gothic-style art, and good old-fashioned rock and roll (turned up a notch).<BR>The journey into this Christian nightmare begins with the thundering IRRESPONSIBLE HATE ANTHEM, painting the picture of the world the listener is getting into before the actual start of the story. It is February 14, 1997, Valentine's Day, as the crowd is ironically shouting the new anthem &quot;we hate love, we love hate&quot; showing that the people are now idolizing the new supreme and ultimate rock star, but in order to find out how he came to power we must start at the beginning...<BR>THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE paints a picture of the world the solemn character of &quot;the worm&quot; is born into. A place where it's &quot;all anatomic as the size of your steeple.&quot; If you are not one of &quot;the beautiful people,&quot; you might as well just get out.<BR>DRIED UP, TIED AND DEAD TO THE WORLD then shows as The Worm is growing being used by others and to ultimately be &quot;all dried up and dead to the world.&quot;<BR>The song TOURNIQUET then in a way illustrates The Worm's love life as in his dreams he dreams of creating the perfect woman. But in the end, he'll just end up being her &quot;tourniquet&quot; just like with any other woman.<BR>The Worm grows and the thunder returns in LITTLE HORN as the forsight of destruction is drawing nearer as The Worm urges everyone to &quot;save themselves&quot; from what he is becoming, but he knows in his mind that it is too late to be saved.<BR>CRYPTORCHID is the beginningof The Worm's long transformation as he sees that despite his weaknesses, he will be growing stronger.<BR>DEFORMOGRAPHY is then the real start of his growth as his rise to become a rock star begins and he starts to realize the love and hate that comes with the business, being conceived as a &quot;dirty rock star&quot; and the control he has over people.<BR>WORMBOY sees The Worm again changing, but is it happening now or being forseen? &quot;Oh no, I am all the things they said I was...&quot; he is just starting to realize what he is becoming.<BR>With MISTER SUPERSTAR, it strongly outlines the whole rock-star life and what he can do with people as THE ultimate rock star. People are now willing to kill themselves for him, he is not only a superstar, he is a leader.<BR>ANGEL WITH THE SCABBED WINGS is a much too late rocking wake-up call that this &quot;superstar&quot; is no longer human and that the followers are doomed, that they must turn back now... but it is too late.<BR>KINDERFELD goes backwards a bit and gives some new light on The Worm and what he has been through and why he is now ready to make his grand entrance as the Antichrist Superstar.<BR>ANTICHRIST SUPERSTAR is then, of course, his coming and him telling the people flat-out that they are the ones doing this to themselves that it wasn't himself that made him become this monster.<BR>1996, an election year, comes pounding into the eardrum illustrating the empowering antics of the new leader. &quot;This is where you faith ends!&quot; he howls as the others scream along with him, doing his bidding. This is the highest point of his power.<BR>Things begin to slow down and turn the other cheek in THE MINUTE OF DECAY in the aftermath of all the carnage. Nothing is left and he might as well go down to, but not unless he can take anyone remaining with him.<BR>The final storm hits with THE REFLECTING GOD chronicling his escape and his revelation that the only God that ever was was him himself. He shall give himselfor anyone left &quot;no salvation, no forgiveness&quot;<BR>The epilogue MAN THAT YOU FEAR then settles it all down to a bittersweet ballad in the message that it can happen again. In the end, the boy that you love could always be the &quot;man that you fear.&quot; Don't make the same mistakes.<BR>The emotional rollercoaster comes to an end with 5 minutes, and 80 tracks of silence followed by TRACK 99, an electronic reminding, or is it plea from the Antichrist. Is he really gone?<BR>This album i believe did much more than try to sell records, it did, in Manson's artistic and fascinated mind, try and make an apocolyptic rock and roll story to try and show us the wrongs and rights of our modern-day society. However you decide to interpret is up to you, but to just at least listen to this album and actually think about what you're hearing.
1590172213|5|This book is really weird, but an interesting read.  I bought it because I like the song &#34;Charlotte Sometimes&#34; by the Cure.  After reading this book, I understand the song lyrics much better than before.
B002JCSWV6|4|From my wife Sarah: I'm really glad I saw this movie. I learned so much, and was just simply amazed (not even a strong enough word) and blown away with the man, Nelson Mandela. This movie showed beautifully what he was up against trying to bring together a torn country full of hate and bitterness. It looked impossible, but he never lost heart.<br /><br />What was so magnificently shown was the incredible forgiveness that Mandela gave. The movie showed him as a true leader and role model for everyone. It effectively showed what he suffered and lost, and how he was willing to fight if absolutely necessary. But it also showed how he looked for a way through peace whenever it was possible (and when it looked impossible to others). He did all this despite what people thought of him. Even his own family. His amazing ability as a visionary, diplomat and peacemaker was shown so well. I was so blown away by this man that I couldn't stop thinking about it. I ended up doing some research on him to learn more.<br /><br />I gave the movie 4 stars because there are long segments that were quite dull. When the soccer games were shown, they were difficult to follow, and very dull. Even my husband who is a huge sports fan couldn't follow and got really bored. Since these scenes take up a significant portion of the film I felt I needed to take that into account in my rating.<br /><br />Regardless, this movie is a real eye opener, and so valuable. It's so worth seeing for everyone.
B0040I09RM|5|Can't quit watching it !! Excellent story line !
014241039X|5|A silly story about revolting people. Which means kids will love it and uptight adults will get all huffy. ;p<br /><br />The Twits are a married couple that are always tormenting one another with pranks. But not nice ones. Ones like putting glass eyes in beer, feeding worms as &#34;spaghetti&#34; and convincing one another that they are shrinking into nothing. But their torments are visited on others, as well, including a family of monkeys they own, who eventually scheme to get their own back on the Twits. The final prank they play is rather brilliant, and draws upon elements from earlier in the story, making this a remarkably well-plotted book for being so short. The foreshadowing is some of the best I've seen in children's literature.<br /><br />A good time. I'd highly recommend this as a bedtime story! I'm glad it's in my personal collection.
B00881VLCE|5|Great game for children and adults a like
B00HDMMISA|5|This book is well written and deals with the many everyday issues of modern life.  The author also manages to bring her characters to life as we learn how their lives intertwine.  If at first the story line seems improbable, just look around the school yard and you will surely be able to allocate these characters to people you know
B009XIXVU6|5|I was hesitant to start reading, since I was a bit disappointed by &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns.&#34; At times it felt slow because Hosseini builds each character so that they seam real. This is well worth your time.
B00O0MBJPO|4|Awesome
B008QE9VJI|5|Dark Shadows the 60's TV show is a very vivid and fond memory from my youth. I remember running home from school to watch it (actually making my mom watch it and tell me about it at first). The theme music scared the crap out of me and haunted my dreams at bed time for years.(The Twilight Zone was another theme that did this).<br /><br />This new film version of the series is nothing like I expected and so much more fun than it should be. I rate it 4 1/2 stars. Depp is in top form as well as the entire cast in this smart and funny spoof. If you're a fan of the original show and can stand a little ribbing this is a jolly good time.<br /><br />The Blu Ray sports an excellent transfer.
B00FXEL00W|5|Engaging, intense page turnner, filled with love and romance between two young best friends dealing with fame, adulthood, and accepting who they really are.
B000IMKDPC|5|I watched it first when it just came out in 2000 and watched it again now with my 3 kids. We enjoyed every minute of it.
0156027321|4|Our bookclub read this book a while back and we did enjoy it. At first the members were skeptical that a book with such a plot would go anywhere, but it does. I can recommend this story because the setting, the ocean, the character-driven plot is all the more why it's good. Highly recommend The Life of Pi.<br />Reviewed by: Franchesca Dashmond of B.E.B.

B00821OX98|5|Love it.
B00DR0PDNE|4|once u get it started It's awesome, it loads quick, ( I get Netflix started quicker then when I'm trying to via the app on my LG Blu-ray Player.<br /><br />But to get the damn thing started, jeez .. first off I plugged the thing in and.... voila no image, tried another hdmi port nothing.. tried the reset button.. nothing<br /><br />I was kinda getting mad on the damn thing when I started googling the problem...<br /><br />very important READ:<br /><br />it seems that on some chromecasts, the reset button is stuck.. you should press it different times after another...<br /><br />inserted it again and boom it worked. It worked ever since.. it works awesome.<br /><br />I personally don't have it plugged in my TV now, but in my sound system's hdmi port. works great and now I can enjoy the surround sound of Netflix etc.<br /><br />I just wish Google would release it in the Netherlands officially so more apps would be available.. now I'm stuck with Netflix, Google Play Music (works great also) and Youtube..<br /><br />Google please release Google Play Movies in the Netherlands... thank you and goodnight
B008MG1E4A|5|This was an amazing account of what happened. I felt as if I was actually there. Of course, it also gave me a clue as to what my brother went through while over there even through he isn't in special ops. It's an easy read. I read it in 3 days. My thanks goes to all our Military Personnel! God Bless each of you. It's definitely worth reading! I'm looking forward to his new book: No Hero: The Evolution of a Navy SEAL that will be released sometime this year.
0316055433|2|Good Lord, what a tedious book!  Liked the story, hated the book.  Waaaayyyy too long, too much unnecessary detail.  At first, I really felt sorry for Theo, losing his mom was the pivotal point in his life, he went downhill from there.  Ah the story went on, I liked him less and less, and couldn't care for him anymore.  He was a self-centered, un-feeling, miserable human being.  The story weaves around the painting, but eventually I could not care less about him squirreling it away.  The ending was way too quick and tidy, the book went on and on with so much minute detail, and the ending was BAM, life is short, it sucks, then you die.  The time-line for me was confusing as well, we start as his 13 year old self, complete with iPods and cell phones, and then modern day, which seemed to take place today.  I think that they whole story could have been written in half the amount of pages.  Some of the detail was so tedious, that I just skipped portions of it.  Wish it held my interest more, and have some redeeming ending.
B008P1EWIM|5|Very useful with lots of great information for your Fire!
B009NNMB70|5|I should start by warning you this DVD does not contain the extended fan cut. However, the bonus features include all 5 boys going home, BSE music video, etc. It's a great film to start & the concert scenes that were 3D in theaters still have a bit of a 3D feel at home. :)
B00E8KLWB4|5|I love to spend hours and hours of my time playing this useless game.  I tell myself I am done after one puzzlement I am off searching for something else. It is a very fun game for those who like puzzles.
B00CSR2J9I|1|Might be great for kids with patience but didn't work for me. No way to tell when the car is going to flip so you cannot control it then you lose and have to do it over again. Ends up being really boring.
B008RA3X5E|4|No matter how deaf I am when sleeping, I always hear my alarm. That annoying sound doesn't make me feel like going back to sleep.
0547391005|5|There will be many a bedtime story to be had with this book. It has all the Curious George stories I remember as a child. Good buy.
B00MUCX6AW|4|i give it 4 stars, very well done with an interesting plot
B006LSZECO|4|While the book was very entertaining, with lots of plot twists and surprises, if you like endings where justice is served, skip this one.  I hated the ending. It was depressing and sad and just wrong.  I wasn't looking for a happy ending, because I don't think that would be possible in this case, but I wanted to see bad things happen to bad people.  I feel angry now that it's finished, and that's not what I'm looking for in a book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5|Appears deceptively simple, but plenty of challenge even for the seasoned puzzle solver. I've had a lot of fun playing this game and can't wait for them to add new rooms!
B00IMZ2PNK|2|Pretty lame movie. Only a couple good parts. I wouldn't spend money for it!<br />To bad it wasn't like the first one.

1101946342|5|This book is Fifty Shades of Grey told in Christian's point of view. Other than being a Dom, he has no idea how a relationship works. When it comes to women he really has no clue!<br />E. L. gives you a shocking and horrific glimpse into his childhood through his nightmares that has you sympathizing and understanding why he views women and relationships as he does.<br />When Anastasia comes into his life, she pretty much rocks his world. With her innocence and caring nature, she breaks all the rules of being a submissive. She wants more.<br />It's fun to see how Christian goes from Domineering to &#34;more!&#34; She makes him question his lifestyle, his past, and even the infamous &#34;Mrs. Robinson.&#34;<br />A great edition to the Fifty Shades of Grey books. I highly recommend it!
079073382X|5|The film was a complete surprise; I was expecting some silly teen movie. What I saw, rather, was one of the most inspiring and romantic movies I've ever seen. Linklater turns a clichéd premise into a lyrical and timeless piece of art. I don't think I've encountered such innocence and sublime simplicity before, perhaps with the exception of D.W. Griffith's TRUE HEART SUSIE (1919). <br />The only other romances that personally inspired me were Frank Borzage's STREET ANGEL(1928) and HISTORY IS MADE AT NIGHT(1937). BEFORE SUNRISE lacks Borzage's Christian transcendence and soft-focus dexterity, but undeniably it belongs to the Pantheon of great romances. It is remarkable how a film can be so simple in premise and technique, and at the same time leave you unforgettable impressions. As Dave McCoy correctly observed, the film achieves emotional and spiritual depth that one may ordinarily find in a Bresson or a Rohmer film. Ethan Hawke may seem a bit irritating, but Julie Delpy is simply divine. <br />Don't ever miss this film.
B001ILFUD2|5|This is a classic Disney film that all children will love. It has a great plot and is easy for children to understand. They will certainly enjoy the characters, the scenes and of course all of the songs.
B008MG1E4A|5|I expected an amateurish and laundered tale but I was wrong. Obviously and correctly many details are omitted for security reasons, but i found the look into the mind of the Seals and the weird world in which they live fascinating. Couldn't put it down.
B000ICXQGK|5|one of the best movies I have watched.
B000005DQR|5|I just heard this album for the first time about a week ago.  I came away very impressed.  Not the typical type of music I listen to, but this takes some serious skill.  Building Steam with a Grain of Salt is sick.
B004FGMDOQ|5|Full of meaning and excitement and adventure. Both sad and full of new beginning. A wonderful book. Something I would read over and over.
B00A6CCF0K|4|Stephen King works his magic again.  He draws you in and keeps you in suspense until the end!  It was an entertaining read.
B00000IQV7|4|It is Robin Williams, what else can be said about one of the Great Actors of our time
B00A9T1HUO|5|He is an absolutely remarkable singer-love everyone of his songs and I've played this CD everyday since I've received it.
B00ESNDQWY|4|Great
B004VMVTNU|5|For several months now, and I simply cannot say enough good things about it.\n\nFor those wondering why all the reviews are 5 stars, it&apos;s because this is simply a great alarm. Stop pretending like you are a Jedi trying to bring balance to the force and write an honest review based on your own opinion. And just because the reviews use prior grammar and punctuation does not mean that a dev wrote it. It means that the person who  typed it gives a damn about the way they speak.
B002LFAHBO|5|Super cast, always something happening! I never get tired of seeing this movie...cute love drama with a little comedy angle they throw in.
B00JQHOB8U|4|has two great songs the rest so so
B000000P17|3|This is Guns N' Roses' slightly odd and somewhat pointless album of cover songs.  It's definitely not at the same level as their previous works and it is a little disjointed, but at the same time it's not that bad.    To me, the band seemed to be trying to return to the simpler, pure rock style that they had during their \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" days, as opposed to the extravagant art-rock style of the \\"Use Your Illusion\\" days.  Their new rhythm guitarist---Gilby Clarke---is also introduced here.  (Curiously, Axl plays a much smaller role in this album than the previous albums---he is the only band member whose photograph is not in the artwork, and he is not even featured at all on a few songs.)    There are a few standout tracks, such as \\"Since I Don't Have You,\\" \\"Ain't it Fun,\\" and \\"Black Leather,\\" and there is also the (in)famous hidden track.  The songs are fun songs, but to me they just don't have the same substance as their original material.     I recommend this for established Guns N' Roses fans, but I think that newcomers and everyone else should probably check out their original material first.
B0079TQHDO|5|Loved this book the whole series is great. Like the early Jeffrey Archer books.
B00BEXB18M|5|All in all I am pleased with the new Megadeth record \\"Super Collider\\". There is a song or two on it that has a different vibe or feel to it. I do recommend this though. I purchased this from Best Buy because it had 3 bonus tracks, two studio cuts and a live track from Countdown To Extinction. The 3D cover is really cool. I have heard reports of the bonus tracks being hidden on some pressings of the regular version. Enjoy!
B004SBS8LA|1|Congratulations Amazon, NOT. You have made it very clear to the rest of us, well done. You do know that America is not the world don't you. Why do you advertise around the world when it is only  available in the US???? VERY, VERY, VERY POOR.
1936608898|5|Great book! I started the Whole30 eating plan on April 1, 2014. I'm on day 19 and feeling great! The information in the book makes so much sense, it's an easy read.
B004GUSG4M|4|This book was a page turner and the ending was totally unexpected.  They are filming the movie with Nicole kidman but for some reason the entire book I was imagining the main lead in the story as Julia Roberts. I will definitely see the movie
B008M4OYYY|5|Cool structure
B00008PW3Q|5|I have been a follower of Fleetwood Mac in all its incarnations since the first time I heard &quot;Landslide&quot; in the mid 70's.  Although there have been low points through the years where the band seemed to have lost its identity (lineup changes, etc.), I have to say, &quot;Say You Will&quot; ranks right up there with &quot;Rumours&quot; among their best work.  I picked up the new CD this morning and couldn't believe my ears. Listened to it several times throughout the day, in the car, and at work.  I was transported back 28 years, while at the same time being amazed at how fresh and &quot;cutting edge&quot; they sound today.  Can't wait to hear it on my home system, as the production work is amazing.  Anxious to purchase the DVD Audio version as well.  The absence of Christine McVie is a disappointment, but the Buckingham/Nicks energy is palpable in every track.  Standouts are &quot;Miranda&quot; and &quot;Running through the Garden&quot;, but there is not a bad cut on this disc.  I have found my CD for the summer!  The music will be difficult to classify, but I sincerely hope it gets the airplay and recognition it deserves.
B004MC8CA2|5|I couldn&apos;t love this app more. It makes carrying my Bible with me everywhere so easy. I love having access to just about any translation ever created. (Bibles are expensive, and now I don&apos;t have to drop $60 a pop just to have a new translation.) I love the reading plans. I&apos;m currently reading the chronological plan, and I can&apos;t tell you what a difference it has made in my comprehension to be reading the chapters in the order they were (probably) originally written. I also love that I can listen to some versions, since it sometimes makes the more difficult passages easier to understand. I seriously LOVE this app. And to those who question the permissions, internet access is needed to access versions that aren&apos;t downloaded to the phone. Also, you create an account with YouVersion so they can help you track your progress and reading goals, and so you can do things like post key and meaningful verses on Facebook if you want. I&apos;ve never been spammed by the developers.
B00P7PBD2C|3|The 'new' take on the old story is interesting as I like my fairy tales with a bit more bite and less sugary-sweetness, even as a kid. There is a decent amount of humor between Maleficent and Diaval, but three 'good' fairies were more annoying than funny, Aurora was dull, and Philip was almost nonexistent (and also dull), which was a bit of a disappointment because Philip and Samson were funny in the original animated version. It was a little amusing that Philip couldn't kiss Aurora awake, and I wish that there a was a bit more focus on the idea that problems can't be solved by the handsome prince, a lesson I think young girls desperately need these days. My own moralizing aside, if I have a complaint about the movie, it's that it capitalizes on Jolie's beauty almost to the exclusion of everything else. Therefore, an enjoyable and visually very appealing movie, but it would have been nice if the other characters had more, well...character.
B00499NHLC|5|loved the show. it was my favorite.  Is there more?  I would love a third season.  Love Benedict Cumberbatch,  He's great.
B000A7DVR2|5|The cult movie of its time. A MUST-have, and definitely a re-watcher. Dude!
B0068TJLSY|5|8mm film is a lost art re-explored with JJ Abrams and Spielberg. This movie is entertaining and lets you see the creature. Good build up, climax and execution of the conclusion. You will enjoy this movie.
B000FP2Z0S|4|Prior to an opportunity to listen to Rise Against,  I'd never followed the band and I remain unfamiliar with their past work.  But with AOL option of listening before you purchase,  I decided I would listen to hear what the hardcore punk band had to offer.  The result of the listen basically revealed that not only Rise Against, but also their new album THE SUFFERER AND THE WITNESS had a lot to offer any interested listener.  To start off with, if you are a big punk fan, especially hardcore punk that has a lot of abrupt transitions in the music, tempo changes, and manic singing from the lead singer,  then Rise Against is your group and this album is highly recommended.<br /><br />The production here for the most part is well done.  Per punk, the guitars are overproduced at given moments, but that goes with the nature of the music.  The sad thing here is that as overproduced as the guitars go here, Rise Against still has nothing compared to the overproduced guitars on Nickelback's ALL THE RIGHT REASONS (cheap shot, I know).  Production of course isn't the big dysfunction of Rise Against.  At times, the lyrics become a bit to incomprehensible and makes the listener think he is listening only to loud, unfounded screaming.  At the best moments in THE SUFFERER AND THE WITNESS, the vocals are balanced with comprehensible lyrics as well as comprehensibly music.  The positive thing is that for the most part, THE SUFFERER does everything right, with only a few flaws.<br /><br />The album opens with a bang with the unique, attention-grabbing \\"Chamber the Cartridge\\".  Instantly with this initial track you here that these punks are going to take you through a ride of driving guitars, raucous drums,  whiny/eccentric/ crazy vocals, and a beaucoup of transitions (tempo, timbre, etc.).  That trend never dies on this album and keeps it fresh.  \\"Injection\\" does one better production wise than it's former track \\"Chamber the Cartridge\\" as you can actually comprehend more of the lyrics and the direction that RISE AGAINST is trying to carry the band and the listener in.  The next three tracks \\"Ready To Fall\\", \\"Bricks\\", and \\"Under The Knife\\" all impress for the most part (though they under impress slightly compared to \\"Chamber...\\" and \\"Injection\\"), but it is \\"Prayer of The Refugee\\" that raises the album to new heights, most unexpected of a punk band.  \\"Prayer of the Refugee\\" features some truly \\"sick\\" guitar work, assertive background vocals supporting the lead, manic lead vocals, and abrupt switches in style, making the track unpredictable by the listener.  Keeping the momentum set, both \\"Drones\\" and \\"The Approaching Curve\\" are equally solid compared to \\"Prayer...\\" and stand among the best of the entire album.  While a few of the tracks at the end of the album fall off slightly in quality and excitement (\\"Worth Dying For\\", \\"Behind Closed Doors\\", \\"Survive\\"),  tracks \\"The Good Left Undone\\" and the even better \\"Roadside\\" keep the pace of the earliest tracks steady.<br /><br />Overall, the album is pretty tight and filler material is on the low.  It isn't without a few flaws, but they aren't enough to truly bog it down.  Perhaps this album will bring Rise Against to the forefront of the music world.  With the work shown here, they should truly be scoring platinum albums like their many contemporaries.  4 stars.lyrics and the direction that RISE AGAINST is trying to carry the band and the listener in.

1250040779|5|Wish I had discovered this author before now. It's really hard to put this down. As it is part of a series, I cannot wait to read the fourth book. I will definitely be reading other Jeff Archer books.
B00FRQ32N4|5|One of the best games I have ever played in forever.
0679722610|2|My book club chose to read this book because it's listed as one of the top 500 books to read. Our group didn't really care for it because it was hard to follow, we didn't know the meaning of the old slang words used, and there wasn't a lot of mystery to the book (the top 500 list listed this as a murder mystery). If you're looking for a good murder mystery in this era, I would suggest reading Agatha Christie.
0446528056|5|I couldn't wait for Sparks to come out with a new book and just happened to walk into Barnes & Noble and saw it calling my name. I absolutely loved this book, maybe it was because I had a recent interaction with someone in the services, i'm not sure, but it truly hit home.  I could understand exactly how the characters felt I wanted to laugh with them, cry with them, and just scream, don't do it follow you're heart. This book truly shows you that if you love someone you will do whatever it takes to make their happiness come true. <br /> <br />Make sure you read it!!
B0010SKUYM|4|I hated this book in the beginning. It's a slow burn, but once it caught fire, I couldn't put it down, and now count myself among one of Rothfuss's many devotees. Looking forward to book three.
B007IXWKUK|5|great
0375851569|5|While the books are smaller than the originals, I had no issue with colour/ink bleeding through the pages. Quality seems good. Highly recommended.
141659521X|5|A great and timely story told by a master storyteller.  The action is non stop.  The story is timely, almost hot off of the presses.<br />If you are a fan of Vince Flynn, you know how good he is at keeping his novels tightly woven.  I recommend this for anyone who is a Flynn fan.
B008GATNNG|5|Delivery time a little longer than expected.<br />Purchased as a gift.<br />CD2 is the best, love entire collection<br /><br />Rusty Campers
B005COO1X6|4|Top notch novelette from Stephen King. Quick read and interesting story with themes from Maximum overdrive (although this would make much better movie than Maximum Overdrive was) and The Body.
B00005NWRS|4|I have seen other reviewers call this frustrating or not a masterpiece, but I am telling you, this could be a benchmark album along the lines of the Stones &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot; or Springsteen's &quot;The River.&quot;<br />Let me say it off the top. I LOVE Whiskeytown's &quot;Strangers Almanac.&quot; Think it was the best album of 1997. Bar none. I love Ryan's first solo effort, &quot;Heartbreaker.&quot; I have warmed to parts of Whiskeytown's posthumous &quot;Pneumonia.&quot; It's just NOT Almanac, and I have accepted that and I can start to view it for its own strengths and weaknesses now. For those twisted souls who don't know Whiskeytown, go immediately and buy &quot;Strangers Almanac.&quot; Better get Wilco's &quot;Being There&quot; if you don't have it, too. You can thank me later. <br />Anyway, it's late 2001 and here comes this sprawling, 16 song (21 if you got the early edition with &quot;bonus CD&quot; (assuming it IS a limited run) like me) set. On top of the first solo CD and the Whiskeytown (rumored to have been a double CD waiting in the can for a year)that makes 51 of Adams songs on the street in one years time. SURELY that equals a glut or quality has been sacrificed. Well, folks, I am here to tell : IT AIN'T SO!!!<br />Adams may burn through bands like a three pack a day smoker goes through books of matches, (And just what did ex- Smashing Pumpkin James Iha contribute to Pneumonia anyway?) but producer/ multi instrumental talent Ethan Johns remains as the glue to all three discs produced this year. They all sound sonically similar, but it's apparent that Johns is interested in keeping Adams interested by reaching for whatever Adams is hearing in his head.<BR> <BR>For example,'New York, New York' is a straight ahead rocker driven by some mad congas; which leads into 'Firecracker', a backbeated mover that quotes Bob Dylan on harmonica; which goes into 'Answering Bell', which, if he has any sense, will be Van Morrison's next single... I DIDcheck and it is not a Morrison song, but damned if it doesn't sound like him (almost... Adams' voice isn't that pure or that deep.) with the Band circa 1972 complete with Benmont Tench of Tom Petty's Heartbreakers doing his best Garth Hudson on the organ. 'Rescue Blues' quotes, to my ears, the style of Elton John's Madman Across the Water,(the album, not that song) complete with pseudo-choir arrangement. 'Somehow, Someday' sounds like a lost Neil Young track. <br />As for the BONUS disc, the five songs here are just as good as those on the regular CD. &quot;The Bar Is A Beautiful Place&quot; is a track too good to be lost on some B Side or bonus CD that not everyone will hear, but that's the way it goes.<br />Comparisons are the easy way out. Adams has a unique voice and touch. Adams quotes his influences without hitting you over the head with them, as the Black Crowes do on occasion.<br />I'll say it here and now: Ryan Adams could turn out to be this generation's Bruce Springsteen. He's prolific enough and he definately speaks as an American voice. Don't believe the &quot;overhype&quot; tag. Get this album.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Cheap enough to buy one foe every tv in the house.  Works awesomely with Netflix and YouTube with a lot more coming soon, ie HBO2go.
B0025KVLT2|5|When I think about what the Beatles did on 'Rubber Soul' it really ends up in that this is the beginning of the bands second phase and a huge part of why the band has endured to such an extent over the years.In terms of the newly remastered sound it's on this era of their recorded activity that it begins to become of big importance. Engineering wise this is the first Beatle album to make really have use of multi tracked backround vocal harmonies and sometimes even doubled up instrumental parts. One of the things that particularly benifits from the new remaster are the slower songs;on \\"Norwegian Wood\\",\\"In My Life\\",\\"Girl\\" and \\"Michelle\\" alone the clarity of the vocals and the music in the backround is more obviously defined-the reverebed effects and bass are particularly enhanced. In terms of the music of course for....those who have't read through the other 666 reviews of this album here already know what a challange it is for me to say anything new. Well one of the things that really distinguish this album is the huge sense of variety it offers up. Within the album you pretty much have five or six different subgenres of rock n roll and the beauty part is it all flows together with such grace and ease you sometimes forget it's even there. Although American listeners who've never heard the album on CD will find the inclusion of the original UK track lineup a little jarring,the progression of the music makes perfect sense in every possible way.\\"Drive My Car\\",along with \\"You Won't See Me\\" and the wonderful \\"The Word\\",a wonderful example of what I call \\"people music\\" in the rock world all have this great chugging rock n soul rhythm and with a groove in the mix that's actually pretty funky is matched with these ethereal Beach Boy type harmonies that bring out an appealing juxtaposition of two qualities you would'nt think would match.  The influence of the wall of sound makes itself felt on \\"Think For Yourself\\" with that same rocking soul groove mixed in as well. Not only are \\"Nowhere Man\\",\\"I'm Looking Through You\\",\\"Wait\\" and \\"If I Needed Someone\\" in sync with the then burgeoning folk rock sound with the prominant 12 string guitar riffs but still there's a stride in the groove any way you cut it. Ringo has a number here, an awkward little country tune \\"What Goes On\\" and John caps it off with \\"Run For Your Life\\",which has to be the most menacing and vindictive Beatle track in history lyrically. Overall this is an album that binds two different stages of the Beatles musical development together and as with any album they did after 1964 it really doesn't replicate in any significant way the sound and style of the previous album.Progression was the key and the Beatles were on their own front line on that end.xed in as well.

B00RNRD8RA|5|They hate us cuz they anus
B000051S44|5|Hey it might be light on story-line &amp; dialogue but the on-board camera work plus those magical sounds,to me,are what make this movie something really special.After all the years since this movie was made,I'm finding it pretty hard to recall another movie on racing that comes even close to this classic.
B000ICXQUQ|5|Classic; wonderful :-)

B00HWWUQYY|1|In this movie they have taken out most of the interesting and clever parts of Tolkein's story, and have inserted massive amounts of gratuitous violence in their place.  The story line is almost unrecognizable as being from the book, and much of the movie could be removed outright and placed into any movie wanting/needing generic violence.  Would definitely not recommend this movie for Tolkein fans.  May be of some interest to those who are not Tolkein aficionados.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Had the apple cable that connects the ipad to the tv for about 4 years, but since im planning to buy the latest ipad, i decided to give this a try. It is amazing! The quality of the image is way better then the apple cable, and it puts youtube videos in great quality on to your tv! If you love netflix, hulu, youtube, and so on, def get it! I cancelled my cable 2 years ago and have only rhose services now, this gadget is great for this!
B00000JGHM|5|Every now and then, Hollywood can surprise you with a good movie. This was one of them.<br />Michael Mann gives us a very beautiful and new perspective into the Cops and Robbers style movie. It pits two men, De Niro and Pacino, against each other in a game of wits. Both men provide some excellent performances, but not totally up to their best. Val Kilmer's role is by far the best, because it shows that the man can act. (Though recent films have said otherwise). The female roles are well-played, even the screwed up daughter played by Natalie Portman. All in all, this is a classic movie. The new-age French Connection.
1401917232|5|I'm so glad I read this book.  It was like a kickstart to my spiritual program.  My reaction to it was similar to what I felt when I finished Gary's book The Disappearance of the Universe.  My spirit was activated and wanted more.  I feel rejuvenated and ready for a more consistent spiritual practice.  Thank you, Gary!
B00LLMFAAG|5|It's awesome. What more do you want?
B003SI9WMS|4|I wavered between three and four stars, but this movie has improved with age (its not mine!).
1490313370|2|I didn't get much from this. I felt he spoke a lot about himself. He did give some ideas but didn't help in directing. This has been my least favorite book and did not feel enlightened in the least. I gave it 2 stars because I think there was good intention but poorly executed. I felt the author went on about himself way too much.
B0000AQS0F|5|It's a damn shame this show didn't go past 1 season.  I felt the same what about the original \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" from the late '70's. <br /> <br />BTW, that's probably where I was ... shying away from a t.v. series I'd totally geek out on.  ;-) <br /> <br />As for the people who cancelled it ... well, that's Fox for you.  If the show doesn't glorify the shallow and stupid Fox won't run it. <br /> <br />(Yeah, I still like \\"The Simpsons\\".)
B005HV6Y84|5|thanks
B00L9B7IKE|3|Good story, but not very well written
B00FATEJYE|5|This game is like my life line with games.
B0049MHU7G|5|One of the best zombie miniseries ever! This is one you have to watch. I saw it first on IFC and when it was made available on Amazon I had to buy it. \\"Big Brother\\" meets \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" and the sole survivors are a group of people who couldn't get along long enough to screw in a light bulb...FANTASTIC! Well written and acted this show will have you on the edge of your seat! The special effects are what you might find in a big budget Hollywood zombie flick. Once again a foreign product has managed to nudge any domestic offering comletely out of the box (Except the Walking Dead on A&E of course). BRAVO!
B004EFYZ1C|5|It was my first app download and it is the coolest so far!  I have a moon phase app on my desktop computer, too.  Love it!
B00E8S2JZ4|5|Love it, love the added footage, love the extras, on time and good price.
B004SBS8LA|4|While Angry Birds is a tremendously fun game, I couldn't stand the ad version of Angry Birds any more.  Not only would the ads slow (or even freeze) the game, they'd constantly drop into the screen, resulting in missed shots and annoying blinking nonsense.  Worse, the ad content is irrelevant, so I'd occasionally get some very inappropriate ads dumped in front of my daughter's face while she was playing on my phone.<br /><br />Angry Birds Rio (Ad-Free) is \\"Ad-free\\" in the sense that there are no drop-in banner ads during the course of playing the game.  The ads will show when you're in between the game levels, paused or at menus.  While that's not really \\"ad-free\\", the ads all appear to be about Angry Birds merchandise, so I'm glad to be rid of the garbage.  They also do not appear to slow my phone, nor do they blink obnoxiously like the ad-loaded version's banners do.<br /><br />If you're new to Angry Birds, the idea is simple:  you use a slingshot to fling birds at flimsy structures filled with little piggies that just sit there waiting to be knocked over.  You have to knock over all the piggies to complete the level.  You use your finger to pull back and release the slingshot, and the birds crash into the structures and cause tons of damage.  Angry Birds Rio varies this a bit by being loosely based on the BlueSky Animation animated film \\"Rio\\", and so your goal is to knock open cages that contain your trapped bird friends.  While this is a full game in and of itself, to me it isn't quite as great as the original Angry Birds of the huge (but difficult) Angry Birds Seasons.<br /><br />What makes Angry Birds fun is both the hilarious cartoon sounds and the chaotic use of physics.  Glass shatters, rock doesn't, and wood can be stubborn.  Knock over one part of a structure and watch the rest of it sway, teeter, and possibly collapse along with it.  The fun gets better as the levels go on, getting more and more intricate.  Some of the levels feature you trying to 'rescue' captured birds by knocking their cages open, in line with the idea of the \\"Rio\\" movie.<br /><br />This is not the original Angry Birds game.  The original Angry Birds was followed by Angry Birds Seasons and then Angry Birds Rio (and all of them are available in ad-loaded and ad-free versions).  Angry Birds Seasons is special because it is on year two of continuous updates to the game:  added levels themed after the holidays of 2011 and now 2012.  It is also harder to play than Angry Birds, so if you haven't played the original, you might want to start with either the original or here with Rio.  Angry Birds Rio is slightly more complicated than Angry Birds in that there is a 'rescue' mechanic.<br /><br />The \\"Ad-Free\\" version may not be 100% Ad-Free, but at the price, it's definitely money well spent.e' captured birds by knocking their cages open, in line with the idea of the \\"Rio\\" movie.<br /><br />This is not the original Angry Birds game.

B00QN2OKAU|5|Stumbled upon &#34;Olsen Olsen&#34; on the local college radio station a week ago. Took about half a minute to fall into sounds that I have not heard before. Just a delicious free fall into the most luxurious and haunting music I think I have ever heard. Goes straight through my heart even though I don't understand a single word of Icelandic. This is true love for a lifetime, much like &#34;Astral Weeks.&#34; The richness and honesty and sheer talent binds you as you would wish to be bound.
B003V6L93C|5|I havent really been a fan of Usher but this CD is one of his best. I love hes Song Yeah from he albums confessions. But this CD is good. Great to dance to. My favotire Track DJ got us falling in love. I have to hand it to Usher , im a fan now!
B00957T6X6|5|Amazing read I highly recommend
B000050488|5|These guys wrote and recorded some great songs.  I think in a few years some innovative band will  maybe try and cover some of them.  This record has more hooks than your daddy's   tackle box...corny...but true
B00CATSONE|2|Less about Tesla and more about imagination.  Doesn't seem to be fact-based.  A lot of speculation and guessing.  Wouldn't recommend it
B004LPLU4K|5|I enjoyed the story and the setting was very pretty. The young girl brought healing to both the young boy and his father because she wasn't afraid to challenge those in authority in her life.
B009AP2G26|5|Amazing!!!!!!!!!! I am obsessed with Glee:) it's sooo awesome and makes me happy! Btw Klaine forever and always! yeah baby!
B00F35B8F8|4|Fast paced and entertaining.  I'm not a Star Trek fan, and I still really enjoyed it. Well worth renting this.
B000FBJAEG|5|Just introduced to this series.  I really enjoyed this book!
B00CLD65X0|5|brilliantly written, and filmed. i love 'Downton Abbey' series and I am very much looking forward to the viewing next season.
B0010SKSTO|5|I liked the book and it makes you think about your own self &#34;tells&#34; and those around you.  Good book.
B00E3BK0QQ|4|Graphics were good and mini puzzles were challenging.  A few more chapters would have been nice.  I enjoyed the game.
B00EE3FVSU|5|Wonderfully developed characters
B00459EZLW|5|Wish this show had never been canceled.
B0091REZMW|4|The game is fun, but at times it is difficult to play.
B007SYWFRM|5|its pretty cool i like it its just like tap zoo and tap dragon park and tap safari pretty cool
B00003CXPD|5|I saw it one time and enjoyed it so much that I had to have one of my own. A must see.
B006VFLIYK|5|Grabs you and keeps you the entire time. Loved it! Just what I needed at the time , a read that takes me away and keeps me hooked and entertained and thinking and guessing and then wanting more of these characters when it ended.
B00ECTZKJ6|5|Bought this for Christmas for my 18 year old son. Had bought this CD previously for my husband. My son liked it so much he had to have it too.

0060987464|5|At a time when I was most bored by my schooling and my family life, including my many apparent social short-comings, I found this to be an excellent opportunity to become aquainted with an individual hated by hypocrites I come in contact with daily. This became an addicting interest in an artist amongst fools who look to an uninhabited cross, emptied by an other man persecuted for his &quot;radical&quot; impact on a society also inhabited by &quot;equals&quot; of inferior wisdom. I would recommend this for reading to anyone confused by Marilyn Manson, his drama and theatrical presentations feared by mothers everywhere a show is played. This book made me realize what to look for in people, not they're false smiles, mint-green suits, happy demeanour and the like. I now see people for who they are, flawed creatures that share problems I once believed I was exclusive to. I wish to express my deepest thanks to: Mr. Manson, Brian Warner, Anton Szandor LA Vey, and Neil Strauss.
B003F3NEBG|5|I'm a huge fan of Austen, in particular Pride & Prejudice, & this is the best adaptation, hands down. I've owned it on video, DVD, & now the blue ray. Even if you already have this on DVD, it is definitely worth getting the blue ray! The colors & details shine in the blue ray version. Textiles which seemed plain before are now shown to have beautiful patterns & variations in color that just do not come across in the DVD or VCR versions. It's like a brad new movie!
B00B2V66VS|5|My granddaughters love this and play it on my Kindle a lot.  It's great fun for anyone who likes video games.

B00IX9UTLU|5|I came across this series while looking for a particular book and decided to read these books instead, I had not read anything by this author until now and I am very happy I did. I have read 50 Shades of Grey and the Bared to You series, both more than once and I will read this series again too. I thought the background stories of Alayna and Hudson were described in great depth and held my attention to the very end. I thought the story was really good, I couldn't put the book down-thank goodness for the Kindle phone app (the book is always with me), the sex was hot, and I plan to read more of Laurelin Paige's books now.
0307276902|4|I just want to say...WHO CARES IF EVERY WORD IS TRUE OR NOT? Memory is a crazy thing and if you are not a writer, you can't totally understand what it is like to write about memories. I could care less if every word is true or not - how true are our actual memories? I don't even care about the \\"message\\" of this book - I just care about reading something that provokes thinking, change, feeling...Are we now going to revisit every memoir and decide whether or not every fact is true or not - and if it's not should we put warning labels on them? The book is very good - not great - regardless.
B002I9Z8I0|5|I am a new star trek fan. I loved TOS and cannot bring myself to watch TNG so I decided to order this movie collection. I loved it! The condition was perfect and I loved the new technology that was put into the movies with still keeping most of the original feel of the shows.
B007TK77QE|4|Worth reading and very well written,  Alot of characters to follow so you have to stay awake.  Would be good if JK wrote another adult book.
B00DR0PDNE|3|youtube works fine, but chrome tab casting is not good. Chromecast does get disconnected frequently when casting a tab. Due to this reason, I was not able to eliminate need of HDMI cable which i was expecting this device to do.
B000062Y98|5|I didn't think they could top &quot;Imaginations&quot; or &quot;Nightfall&quot;, but here's proof of how wrong I was!<br />Incredibly powerful vocals, harmonies, melody... Superb songwriting, even. If you think all fantasy power metal lyrics are silly and cheesy, this album could change your mind. The metal bards tell stories based on The Iliad, Gallileo, Nietzsche, Dragonlance, and more. All the songs are very well thought-out, emotional and inspired (yes, even the Dragonlance one).<br />If you like Blind Guardian, this is a definite 5+ stars must-have. If you like power or progressive metal in general, it still deserves 5 stars.
B000U6BT40|5|Love season one of eureka.. It kept my interest.. My only regret that it took this long to find this show..
1451666179|5|I loved the book as much as I love the blog. I can't wait for Allie Brosh to publish her next book. My only issue was that the binding completely fell apart. I may buy a 2nd copy just to have a more intact copy for myself.
B00E1LT41K|5|I truly enjoyed this mini-series, it was very intense and well done. I could tell it was filmed on location, the costumes were fantastic and every episode showed a slice of history that was well written and well acted. FANTASTIC!
B00RL9WRAE|4|Denzel is always really good in movies like this.  His no swagger demeanor and style is just awesome.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.
B00COH0W00|3|Kind of cheesy as you knew what the outcome would be but &#34;cute&#34; anyway.  Seen better, seen a lot worse.
B00005JKLZ|2|This movie should have H. G. Wells turning in his grave. I thought this would be a hi-tech remake of the original Rod Taylor flick. However the plot was thin, no character development to speak of, a vague story line and the ending was very disappointing. I will say that the special effects, visuals, sound etc. were good, however the movie falls on its face.  Unfortunately, I bought this DVD without first reading the reviews here on .... I could have saved myself [$$$]. Maybe worth the rental price, but not worth purchasing.
B003JTHXOK|3|I have read several Nicholas Sparks books and this one was entertaining but certainly not one of his better books. Sparks has the capability of using a far more sophisticated story plot and development of characters. The part in the story where Jo is revealed to be the lead's alter ego is the only worthwhile development to the otherwise seen it before-seen better love story.
B008JFUNYG|5|Love this movie
B007P3TMW2|5|Very good!  Keeps your attention. For those who remember that day, being hundreds of miles away, it's inspiring to see it from the eyes of someone that was there!
0857522329|5|I absolutely could not put this book down, and read it in two days.  It is a totally gripping storyline, keeping the reader's interest from start to finish.  The book is very reminiscent of &#34;Gone Girl&#34; and I know it would make an awesome film!
B0000027RL|4|I like Pearl Jam alot. Ten is a great album. Pearl Jam is one of the greatist rock bands in the past 25 years. I dont understand the arrgument between Pearl Jam and Nirvana. I prefer Nirvana and thats my opinion. I was reading in a magazine the other day about Pearl Jam was opening for Nirvana and Pearl Jam did \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" for there last song and when thy went of Eddie said to Kurt \\"Remember we did it first\\". I almost died laughing. Ten is one of the greatist albums in the past 25 years. Pearl Jam is in the top 10 of the greatist rock bands of all time.

Sagan makes excellent use of  SETI's current search methods as well as his own  knowledge of astronomy and physics to bring a sense of  reality to the book. But above its literacy, philosophy,  and speculation, it is an entertaining story that is not  overshadowed by gadgetry.

0887431453|5|Perfect for starting you young one with teaching them to for pre-school.
B0031ESW8O|5|It is enough to recommend this book if only for its' style!  I have never read a book in which the characters each recount their perception of events as the plot unfolds.  It was a fasinating way to tell a mystery story!
B00280LYIC|5|after i read this book i got the sea of monsters. i love this one better. i think its because you are just learning who percy is and his first summer at camp half blood but there are much better situations in this book. MANY SURPISES

B002P764NS|5|Our whole family loves this hilarious ensemble comedy show.<br /><br />Sheldon is an eccentric physicist with Nobel Prize potential and limited social skills. His roommate, Leonard, is a run-of-the-mill genius by comparison; also brilliant, but self-aware enough to know there is more to life than physics research. Their social group is rounded out by Raj, another physicist who is to shy to talk when women are present (unless he has had a few drinks) and Howard, the mere engineer of the group. These four friends are fairly content to watch science fiction films, collect action figures, and chase girls unsuccessfully . . . until they meet the girl next door (literally), Penny, the aspiring actress and \\"dumb blonde\\" who can teach these four brilliant scientists a thing or two about enjoying life.<br /><br />The characters are all likeable and relatable in their own ways and mostly nice to one another.<br /><br />You might think these characters are over the top, but I have met enough geeks to know that people like this really do exist . . . and really are entertaining.<br /><br />Fun for the whole family; we haven't yet seen an episode that didn't make us laugh out loud!
B00SI7GDBM|5|Very good movie.
B00J2PCCYQ|2|Beautiful visuals, but a very weak story premise and totally bland music. It was pretty unmemorable for a Disney movie.
B003MYYJD0|5|Perfect!
B00687Q0VC|5|Just. Excellent. My husband is watching the series for a second time!
B00E8KLWB4|5|This is a great free app! It's challenging and fun. Even though there is in-app purchasing, if you don't want to spend money you can still advance. It takes longer, but the game still continues to advance your player level, and you earn rewards to help as well. Truly a fun game.
B00FEN58KA|5|Well given the look on my grandniece's face I would say that this item was a total hit. Thank you.
0486282112|4|We rate this book four star for a few reasons,which apply to how we understood the context of the story.<br />  The book gives you a good understanding of the emotions of the creature named Frankenstein.  It brings you in to all the  pain and misery that the creature suffered ever since he was created by Victor Frankenstein.  This is a book that will affect your outlook on life and how you treat other people.  It shows examples of many emotions such as curiousity, love, kindness, and revenge.  We discovered the fatal mistakes of Victor Frankenstein, when he created his monster through the blindness of ambition.  Though the story was of course at times suspenseful and violent, it is also a romantic love story between Victor and his adopted sister Elizabeth.
B001DPHDCY|5|I think Jim Carrey and Steve Carrell's voices are perfect for these characters.  It's a cute movie that my family enjoys. The price was reasonable on Amazon.

B0014DW3OS|5|Love this movie. Very entertaining. And apparently there is a minimum word expectation so I have to type some more words.
0143124544|2|Did I read the same book???<br /><br />The author bit off more than she could chew with the subject matter, and failed to express any of it originally or with any TRUE compassion or insight. The whole story was trite right down to the smallest details, of course he was a rich handsome playboy, and she's a bumbling, 'eccentric,' n'er-do-well who would have never crosses paths until his tragic accident. Blah, blah, blah snoozefest, It's the same old, opposites attract under inopportune circumstances. Kind of reminded me of a reverse role version of Titanic, but instead of an iceberg it's a wheelchair.<br /><br />This is no 'Diving Bell and the Butterfly.'

B00079FUI6|5|Having only caught the odd episode of Desperate Housewives when it aired on Channel 4, I remember enjoying it and decided to buy the first series on DVD - and its even better then I remembered.<br /><br />The four desperate housewives are the main protagonists in the series. Bree, who on the outside seems to be the perfect housewife with the perfect family, while actually her marriage is in trouble and her kids are rebelling against her. Gabby, the ex-model who married for money, not for love and has to resort to sleeping with her 17 year old gardener to find happiness. Susan, a single mother who gets along very well with her daughter but is constantly plagued by troubles with men as she tries to find love. And Lynette, the only happily married housewife, who has to deal with 4 troublesome sons.<br /><br />Right from the very first scene of the first episode, the mystery and drama starts and it doesnt stop untill the end. I found the series very compulsive viewing and often ended up watching 3 or 4 episodes in a row because I just HAD 2 find out what happened next.<br /><br />The show has mystery (a lot of it), drama, romance and is very funny in places, too.<br /><br />An excellent series which I would deffinatly reccommened.
B004SJ3BCI|4|I play quite often. It is a lot of fun. My grandson plays it as well. He is better at it that grandma is.
B000002L68|5|_Purple Rain is known as Prince's definitive work, but how can you define the undefineable artist?  The album took music to new level that year.  Coming off the 1999 lp Prince had forged a reputation in funky r/b. With  tracks like the guitar driven Let's Go Crazy, and the title song, this  artist made funk rock music that made him hard to pin down categorically.  When Doves Cry was a dance smash while Computer Blue was just that: a  blusey r/b rock song.  The Beutiful Ones is a classic prince pop ballad and  I Would Die for you sort of summed up the album emotionally. Even if you  never saw the film you could feel the raw emotion of the song as well as  the feeling of continuity throughout this classic gem. This is an all time  all genre album right up there with Sgt. Pepper(beatles) and What's Going  On (Marvin Gaye).
B007FEFLTO|1|I almost didn't finish reading this book. Follett just does not write good sequels. I won't bother with Book 3.

B000002TQV|5|Just rating the Radiohead albums, because I feel the need to.  For whatever reason.  There is some touching stuff on this album, and more obvious showcase for their songwriting talent.  Most of the songs on this album are stunningly simple in their arrangements and execution.  But the command over mood and pure sound these guys have is on full display.  Fake Plastic Trees and Bulletproof form the template for all of the Coldplay style Brit-Pop of this decade.  With its delicate acoustic guitar, and floating ethereal backing noises and strings.  But even then these songs beat their counterparts.  The head just never got more pop than high and dry, but I think it has one of their best hooks.  The overwhelming impression you get from this album is just restrained depression, someone on the brink of collapse, but not letting go.  It's fascinating really, you keep expecting a release of some kind, some ovewhelming display of emotional outpouring that never really comes.  But even with all of this, it still ends in happiness, so immerse your soul in love...

B002SSBD6W|4|I am not now, nor have I ever been, a vegetarian. However, living as I do in Berkeley, California, from time to time I find myself in the minority at dinners and potlucks. So, as you might imagine, over the years I've come to hear most of the arguments against eating animals.<br /><br />One thing has always puzzled me about the torrent of passion that invariably erupts when I question why I, or anyone else, should become a vegetarian (much less a vegan): apart from a few rejoinders that the practice of limiting my diet to plants will improve my health, extend my life, and make me a better person overall, most -- maybe 80 percent of the verbiage -- concerns cruelty to animals.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong. I like furry little animals as well as the next person. Over the course of my long life, I've had dogs, cats, and rabbits as well as a few less cuddly animals such as turtles and fish as (dare I say it?) pets. Nor do I kick dogs or other helpless beasts when I'm angry or frustrated with other human beings.<br /><br />But why do so many people justify vegetarianism on the basis of animal cruelty when the practice of raising animals for food in factory farms promises to drown our country in [...] and spew so many greenhouse gases into the atmosphere that it may eventually inundate low-lying coastal cities like Berkeley and make our planet uninhabitable for the human race?<br /><br />Where's your perspective, people? Cheez! We're already eliminating a million species a year from the biosphere by encroaching on animal habitat and screwing with the climate, and you're worried about hurting chickens and cows?<br /><br />Do I want to hurt chickens or cows? Of course not! I've even petted a heifer or two myself over the years. But still . . .<br /><br />To give due credit, Jonathan Safran Foer does explain some of the environmental consequences of factory farming in Eating Animals. But his foray into the hidden depths of this tragically misconceived industry is almost exclusively focused on -- guess what? -- animal cruelty. His descriptions of the way animals are treated are purposely graphic and sometimes hard to take. PETA will love this book. If you don't have an iron stomach, you might not.<br /><br />Eating Animals is Foer's first venture into book-length nonfiction. It's his fourth book. The novels that preceded it, Everything is Illuminated and Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, have attracted critical acclaim, including a number of literary awards, and both are being adapted to film. (He also produced a strange  work of fiction that was more a sculpture than a book.) For what it's worth, I tried reading Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close but couldn't get past the first few pages. However, Eating Animals is brilliantly crafted. Foer's writing style, perhaps even his personality, come through loud and clear. He's obviously a brilliant young man, and if he can avoid falling prey to the silly experimentalism of some of his early work, he's got a great career ahead of him.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, are you wondering why I haven't become a vegetarian?

B008OOYALE|4|Cute dragons and fun little game. I like breeding to see what I'll get. I wish it was easier to get gold without spending real money, though, as some features can't be enjoyed without gold.
B0007TKNIS|5|This is the second copy that I have purchased...unfortunately my daughter loved the DVD so well that I was forced to relinquish my copy.  The acting and production reminds me of the Broadway presentation.  Fortunately, I now can be reminded of the Broadway performance at my convenience with this rendition.
B00DKY4LBW|5|Cool album - arabella is my favorite. Don't know whether I like the Helder back up vocals are not, but they definitely make for a differently colored album.
B00AQ3K8IU|4|I never write reviews because I feel I judge too harshly but this book was great! It held my attention the whole time. This is my first read by Hoover but ive become an instant fan! The story breaks your heart but you cling to every word just waiting for the next revelation! Plus its well written unlike books Ive read recently about broken characters and the dire need for physical/ sexual dependency.
B004W2UBYW|5|This book is a must-read for anyone who lived through the evolution of the personal computer as well as those who didn't.
B00BHHIWQO|4|Fun and very addictive game to play.  I like to play while in line someplace,it helps the time pass quickly.

B004LUS390|4|Very fun, powerful (has layers). Showed to my friend that is a design student, says she could definitely use if she forgot her paper. (Although she has a smart phone so will likely need a stylus). Used on Nexus 7.
B00K2CHWYI|4|This move has a good unique story line.  It is a very entertaining movie.
044024630X|5|Still cannot believe they made a movie of one of Child's novels using Cruise as the part for protagonist Jack Reacher - who is described by the author as being a former MP, 6'4&#34; tall, solidly built at 240 lbs or so- respectfully, Cruise is like 5'6&#34; to 5'8&#34; and 175+ lbs soaking wet! I do not believe the author had any say in who they chose to play the part. Lee Child is a great author. If you are going to read his works, start w/ the first one and work your way up. It is worth it. Mr.Child cranks out some genuine page turners!
6305428042|5|Hocus Pocus is one of those movies where you watch it once and it becomes a Halloween tradition for many years to come.  When the Sanderson Sisters from old Salem are reincarnated back into their former selves after being hanged for being witches, the modern day 1990s Salem is in for a Halloween they will never forget.<br /><br />The Sanderson Sisters, played by Sarah Jessica Parker, Bette Midler, and Kathy Najimy, are after children.  They need their life force to remain young and beautiful.  This, of course, doesn't leave the children in good sorts.  When they are first introduced they are in historical Salem where they are hanged after consuming the life force of a young girl.  Her older brother, Thackery Binks, in his attempt to save her, gets transformed into a black cat that is cursed with immortality.  He takes it upon himself to guard the Sanderson Sister's abandoned house for 300 years.  Until, unfortunately, Max, his sister Dani, and his love interest bring the sisters back to life.<br /><br />The movie is hysterical, mostly centering around the naivete of the sisters three centuries later, and it is a good watch for people of any age.
B00KFUU3GQ|2|As someone who does not particularly like vampire flicks, I thought the acting in this episode was pretty good. I would say it kept my attention. The focus of the young waitress and her concern for this handsome stranger was appealing. She came to his defense and suffered for it as she was accosted by the greedy couple who wanted to literally drain his blood.  The underlying message seemed to be these vampires may be different because they need blood to survive but they can be lovable. We have to survive and watch out for those who want to drain our blood. I would watch again and give the cast kudos for their efforts.
B008QZ1ZYQ|4|good album

B00271HTLI|4|I love Harry Potter!<br />In the third movie of the series, Harry is being stalked by his godfather, notorious prision-escapey Sirius Black. He deals with hypogriffs, time turners, and werewolfs. It's not my favorite movie of the series, but I do still like it.
B005IDXIL2|5|Awesome product, instant delivery
0060899220|5|As someone who has been in and out of the restaurant business for over 25 years I love this book. I have long said \\"that there are restaurant people and they are a different breed.\\" We are a fringe subculture with our own sets of standards that determine if you are \\"with it\\" or \\"not going to hack it.\\" Patrons often don't appreciate how their behavior becomes the fodder of our jokes that help us get through a shift without killing someone. If everyone had to work serving others for some period of their life there would be a lot fewer condescending patrons and less tolerance for restaurant employees who can't hack it and just go through the motions.
B009TGVUPA|5|Hilarious, the ending was so predictable and funny
B004SMDJ9U|5|Love it!!
B00BAXFACO|3|I have enjoyed the Lincoln lawyer series, although I thought the movie was better than the books. Was hoping there would be more movies, but I guess that won't happen. This one gets us caught up on Mickey's life since the previous book. Will be enjoyed more by those that have read the other books.<br /><br />The ending seemed contrived, unbelievable to me. To me, this is beginning to be the same old stuff, just repackaged a bit. I probably will not read another one. Shame, as I have been enjoying them.
B005PK56TA|5|Freaky and horrific! I can't believe they showed this on tv! Plenty of mystery left to the imagination to keep me wanting more!

B009LIQ5FQ|5|If you want a one word review of this concert video the word would have to be \\"FUN\\" no question about it.  This video captures a Pogues show quite well showing the band and the crowd having a raucous good time!  We were lucky enough to see the Pogues here in Chicago about a year ago and this truly does capture the energy in the room during a Pogues show.<br /><br />For those of you that follow the Pogues you'll know that frontman Shane MacGowan likes to have a little bit of the whiskey before the shows, sometimes causing him to miss the performance and sometimes making him pretty incoherent on stage.  While all of that adds to the charm and the mystique of the Pogues if you ask me here, for a night in Paris, Shane is in fine form.  There are times during the show where you catch another band member's reaction to what Shane is doing on stage and there are smiles all around.<br /><br />The picture quality is excellent and the shots and cuts all make sense.  We have all seen concert footage where the director thinks his job is to jump from camera to camera with no apparent rhyme or reason and that, thankfully, is not the case here.  Even with this video being pushed out the door a few weeks after the concert the end result is a quality product.  The sound quality is excellent and should be turned up until it is making your speakers shake.<br /><br />The crowd shots here are a whole lot of fun.  If you've never been to a Pogues show you might be surprised that a mosh pit is a regular sighting at the front of the stage and here in Paris is no different.  The crowd is banging around, people are crowd surfing and overall having a damn good time.  The Pogues music is all about fun and the fans react to it.<br /><br />The musical selection here is pretty standard for a modern Pogues set, it really plays as a greatest hits type of show and I think that is exactly what the fans want.  Shane gives up the mic for a few songs giving Spider Stacy and Andrew Ranken a chance to lead the best Irish Punk band in the land.<br /><br />Overall I have to highly recommend this to anyone that likes the Pogues and to anyone that likes good music whether it be Irish Punk or anything under the sun.  I love Shane and I love the Pogues and this video had me smiling from beginning to end.  This concert video is a whole lot of fun and shows the absolute joy the Pogues have making their music and their fans have listening.the best Irish Punk band in the land.<br /><br />Overall I have to highly recommend this to anyone that likes the Pogues and to anyone that likes good music whether it be Irish Punk or anything under the sun.

B00A8ECU24|4|Its a good game. my 6 year old loves it. Somethings are kind of expensive to get multipliers to gain more points and that's where I dislike the game. Other than that its great.
B009CPES4I|5|This was as good as it gets.  Being in India a half a dozen times I can say this movie only brings a portion of the sensory overload you see there, but I still enjoyed every minute.  The cast was excellent and the camera shots as well as the audio allowed us to see, hear and feel what the movie conveyed.  Thanks for a great escape from our encapsulated lives.
B00JORDEJ4|5|can't wait for Season 5
B00AN0KBJC|5|Too bad I do not have HBO because I will have to wait until it's available on Amazon to watch Season 3 ... love the persoanlities and interweaving story-lines. The character development is great, especially like the way they seamlessly introduce new characters! Definitely a great show to watch on HBO or when available on Amazon!
B000QRIGLC|5|OUTSTANDING!!!!!<br />This book should be required reading for every High School student.  This is a no nonsense look at war and the mindset of the enemies of free thought.  EVERYONE should read this book.

0553802534|5|Lisa Gardner takes a seemingly \\"normal\\" crime scene and turns it upside down.  A police sniper shoots and kills a husband that had a gun in his hand with his wife and child present in the room.  In State Trooper's Bobby Dodge's view, the killing was justified.  The facts and the secrets slowly come out that make you want to say who's to blame here?  Bobby Dodge's life starts to unravel when the parents of the \\"victim\\" decide to sue him. At the same time Catherine Gagnon is calling him for help.  Catherine was a victim of a pedophile 25 years ago who is unexplainably released early from prison.  People close to Catherine are murdered and fingers start pointing at Bobby.  You feel for her helplessly sick son and are shocked further when a secret is revealed.  Did she know what she was doing? How to get the SWAT team to her house that night?  It's left up to you to decide.  Alone moves rapidly along, so pay attention to the details.

B00AC8ZA3M|2|Plot moves along too slowly.
1452000247|5|The writing in Peter - A Darkened Fairytale reminded me of a cross between Alice in Wonderland, Harry Potter and the original Hobbit.  O'Brien draws you in so totally with his descriptive writing you can accurately and vividly visualize each scene.  If I had to compare the imagery to a movie, I would suggest this could easily be turned into an animated picture along the same lines as the original Hobbit with its grand adventures and interesting characters.<br />Peter is an average boy who comes into a great quest on his tenth birthday.  The story lines of elfin, talking mushrooms, The Path of Information and other countless characters that could only have been born of a creative imagination will hold you until the very end.<br />If you have a young or middle-grade reader who loves stories that capture their imagination and takes them to faraway places with quests befitting the even the bravest soul, this story is for them, and parents will enjoy reading it with them as well.<br />Bravo to O'Brien for creating such a marvelous piece of imaginative, creative writing.  This is one that will surely entertain young readers for many years!

B00CZ1TMUQ|5|Awsome ovices
B000XUBFE2|2|I bought this one because it came highly recommended and I was in the midst of reading up on WWII. This must be one of those books you either love or hate. All I can say is I couldn't finish and deleted it from my Kindle. While I like the author's use of Death as Narrator, I hit a place where the story dragged on, causing me to lose interest which I never regained. There are too many books to read in too little time, as the saying goes, and this one wasn't worth struggling with.

B00475AYJQ|4|A great book from an author that has just left u hanging. I will no longer buy series from this author unless they are complete (great author but I refuses to be left hanging again), I purchased a few others from this author and have enjoyed them as well but will not start another series. So if you have not read this book, don't until the 3rd is out and you wont be disappointed.

B00H71PHS0|5|Absolutely love it.  Stumbled  across this series and became hooked. Watching every episode for the 2nd time. The story line is great. The actors are fabulous! Highly recommend.
B004EHZPEG|5|Author describes his view on development of games. Examples from Magic: The Gathering to projects for Disneyland.<br /><br />Book is filled with interesting ideas and approaches for game development.<br /><br />It is totally worth to read more than once. Don't believe to reviews - just try a sample.
B0011NVC98|5|The value of this gloriously rendered visual spectacle is entertainment.  Forget the literary parallels with, or deviations from, a timeless classic epic poem.  Forget religious issues, high moral and philosophical ponderings, forget deep, complex characterizations, subliminal messages and historical realism.  Just sit back and enjoy what the movie, unapologetically and masterfully intends to be, which is pure, first-rate entertainment.  There is no need to go beyond the simple story messages of the value of courage, even when coupled with bombastic lack of humility; Beowulf is many things and lacks many virtues, but the man is brave, period, and makes no apologies for the fact.  The human weaknesses and the price to pay for them, often extending far into the future and beyond the original generation, should be self evident and sufficient, no additional philosophizing need be applied here.  And most viewers agree that the simply awesome visual effects and masterful use of state-of-the-art CGI technology make this film a non-stop feast for the eyes.  Cartoon-like?  Sure.  Accurate?  Of course not.  Politically correct?  Definitely not.  Pure, enjoyable entertainment with great visuals, excellent music score and impeccably cast characters?  Now you get it.
B0071XO8RA|5|At the time of this review, there were 2,192 reviews, 1,902 of which were 5 stars. There's a reason why 90% of readers gave this story a 5-star review - it's a seamless and beautiful read that belongs in the Norton Anthology of Science Fiction. In the short amount of time, the author tells a complete and rich story with strong character development and a clever plot. He knows exactly what details are critical to progressing the story and which ones would only fluff up the word count. And he even manages to pull off an elegant ending.<br /><br />-- Emma D, aka Anna Zimmerman
B0040I09RM|5|Great show
B00I7696IG|5|I could not put it down, like reading Tinker, Tailor all over again
B000U6BT40|3|Nerdy sci-fi comedy/drama set in present-day USA, with decent visual effects. Witness the trials and tribulations of an ex-US marshal turned town Sheriff in the weird town of Eurika, home to the fictional Global Dynamics corporation, which researches lots of weird tech. Lots of fiddling with time-travel, mind-control, and side-effects of mysterious artifacts.<br /><br />Far more shallow than Babylon 5 or Battlestar Galactica, or even DS9 in terms of story arc, bit enjoyable nonetheless. In later seasons it joins up with Warehouse 13, in the same universe.

B009O5CLZY|2|This game crashes like crazy fix it on an update or you will not see me playing this game ever
B009JBZH54|1|The movies were great and are even better when watching them back to back. However when I bought my Blu-Ray player I made the decision to buy only the premium products (deluxe edition/special editions/directors cuts etc etc) I did not want to clutter up my collection with movies I might watch once or maybe twice. The things I buy now I know I will watch at lease several times. The reason I gave it one star is simply because AFTER you open it there is a little piece of paper telling you that in 2013 there will be a Deluxe Edition box set released. I would have rather waited and paid a little more for the deluxe edition.<br /><br />Also each disk goes from scenes in full screen to letterbox and back again but I am told that is because of the IMAX scenes.<br /><br />If you are like me and want to buy the special/deluxe editions in box sets do not buy this YET.
B00TZE3W2U|4|Great album, a lot of experimental stuff here that covers all kinds of genres with the trademark Faith No More crunch and bass thrown in.<br /><br />All the tracks are great except for Seperation Anxiety and MF (yes I didn't care for it) which I found a little on the dragged out experimental side but they are still good songs in a strange twisted FNM way. Matador reminds me of the Crab Song as it starts out pretty tame and punches you towards the end. Some songs on here also have a lot of Angel Dust type feel to them.<br /><br />Overall if your an FNM fan and particularly of Angel Dust this album is fantastic. The only reason for the 4 stars is because a couple of tracks are a bit too experimental and the entire album isn't as upbeat or uptempo as...say The Real Thing or even Angel Dust.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B0029VT3UQ|4|The Reader is a coming of age movie with a different twist on the Halocaust. In the Reader, we see how deeply the scars from this grim event can cut. Harboring a dark secret, Kate Winslet,s character makes a lifelong impression on a young man which in turn haunts his life. This movie is full of raw emotion, raw sex, and raw appeal.
B00BD99JMW|3|Loved the books but let down by the ending to this one... I don't want to give anything away, but the one thing that pulled me through the series was shattered by the end.  Roth did an excellent job of guiding my imagination through the action-packed series, but with all the loss and heart break it would have been nice for a more settling ending.  I have been trying to convince a friend to start reading Divergent, but because of the ending I think I will save her the heartache and not recommend it anymore.
B00AREIAI8|4|The graphics in this game are amazing. My daughter loves it. I have had a problem with starting it again after I close it.
B008EQIK90|1|didn't finish watching it - too much bad language to begin with!
B004RJMUJO|1|droid 2 rebooted phone and ate my angry bird app... poof its gone ... a guess a good way to get rid of compatition... i dont trust anything that reboots my phone would think it might be instaling nothing good ... who knows i dont.
B001FBSMF8|5|So it isn't Soundgarden or Audioslave...the man has a voice that can sing anything! I am a big fan of his voice, not to mention the blue eyes!!    I am glad to see an artist of his caliber not be afraid to try new things. It's how we learn and grow!     Stay stuck in the past and you get the same thing rehashed...If you are a true fan of his gifts, you will find something to like about this CD.     I was a doubter, but am a believer again!
B005K01VZS|5|This book makes you feel good. Right along with all Alblooms good vibes. Very touching and worth the 2 days it takes to read! You can't put it down!
B000EULJLU|5|To get the full extent of this album you MUST listen with an open mind, putting yourself in a distraction free sense. This has to be one of the best if not the best album ever produced. The lyrics are very well thought through and have alot of meaning if you really listen. If you listen to this album with expectations for it to live up to other Tool CD's you probably will be disappointed. The music is thick and very well instremented. Everything is very harmonic and flows well together.  <br /> <br />My favorite song on the CD is \\"Right In Two\\" if you really listen to the words you will understand what Maynard is trying to get accross. It is almost an extension of Parabola. \\"Father why did you give these people free will, now they are all confused. Donkey's talk and monkey's know that Eden has enough to go around.\\" In my opinion I think this song is about pre-existance, peace with all existance, Spirits watching us through the veil \\"confused and amused\\" Then is goes on to show how humans progressed with free agency, given thumbs \\"to make clubs and beat each other down.\\"  <br /> <br />Rosetta Stoned does have guitar riffs that are very similar to other Tool works. I think Tool did that on purpose. I don't think they are having to rehash their old art. I think they are trying to tie their albums together to make a whole collective experience.  <br /> <br />Tool has grown and matured and if people can not see that or respect it then they aren't true music enthusiasts. You have to really appreciate music and the art of it to really get what Tool is trying to get across. If you aren't up to the challenge then don't buy the album. <br /> <br />The whole album does tell a story, every song does fit together you just have to listen with an open mind to get it. If you don't you never will. <br /> <br />And to all the haters out there:  I'd like to see you make an album that wasn't all sugar-pop and make it better than this.
B00H8C4HZ2|5|An entertaining way to review the history of the struggle for civil rights and the tensions within a modern family.
B0085YOZFE|3|its ok
038532653X|5|Skellig is a great book by a great author called David Almond. This adventurous book is full of vivid writing which helps the story flow smoothly. Adventures and mysteries are what lie behind the cover of Skellig. Skellig is a really, really, really good book for ages 9 and up. Way to go David Almond you wrote a great book that many people love to read.
B006QF5CU6|4|Good movie for its time!
B000RZIGVS|2|Obviously I love Star Trek: The Next Generation and if I was just reviewing the show I would say 5 stars.    The packaging, as expressed in other reviews, is simply awful.  All the discs are together in brittle green case with packaging tape binding them together.  The seasons aren't separated, although I will say that the discs are clearly marked so finding the seasons is more annoying than a real problem.  The craftsmanship on some of the graphic elements is a iffy, the text is actually blurred on some of the disks and it is difficult to get the green cases back into the large plastic container.  Because the green case isn't made out of a very flexible plastic, I'm concerned that I may crack the discs or the case whenever I remove a new disc.    On a positive note, there are some extras including interviews with the cast.  Audio commentary on some key episodes would have been great, but is not included.  The other positive is it is the least expensive way to get all of the seasons.
B008XBCJ34|5|Great movie. Good movie, what more can I say, it was a good movie as I stated in the title.  3D even better.
B001HN6918|5|First off this movie is so funny! It arrived super fast and was exactly what I had ordered. Great job
B00Y6QF0PE|5|I love this book just as I loved the other's in the series!
B0009XT8YW|4|This was one of the best albums of its time, I still listen to it. I've always liked these two artists and when they collaberated on this album, it was my most played album in my Striesand collection
B0097EWK3A|4|Glad I found this you can get as or almost as much help as you need! Caution very addicting! Enjoy!!!
B001B9BEF4|2|I remember when the White Stripes released this album and the radio was playing the pop lead song hourly. I always wanted to hear the rest of the album. I have to say that I wish I'd just bought that single.
1607747308|5|I'm only a third-way through this book, and have since gotten rid of 3 trunk-loads of clothes and other items. I was feeling so overwhelmed by clutter and am so grateful to have finally found a system, for solving my problem. Now I have so much more room in my closet, and can see and wear the items I love most. It has already transformed my life so much and I can't wait to see what else happens when I finish the book and complete all of the steps.
B0090SI4LU|5|Great movie, comes close to the book.
B000KJT8IG|5|A great addition to my Christmas movie library. It is my favorite of the &#34;N L Vacation&#34; series of movies.
014241543X|5|I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie. Now after reading the book, I probably wont! This is a great book and well written. I dont want the movie to ruin it. It's an easy read.
B00SXK8R6S|5|I have been a fan of Dianna Gabaldon since the Outlander book was first released and have loved and enjoyed everyone of the following books in the series. I never thought I would see this wonderful book brought to the screen in a way that would do it justice but I have to say I was thrilled when I watch the episodes.  The actress is Claire, the actor is Jamie, the cast is excellent, I'm hooked.  Please continue the show, make all the books into this exciting series so I can have years of enjoyment. Can't wait for the 2nd half to begin.  Thank you
B008JGSM6G|5|This game is addicting! Best app I have downloaded in a while. I could spend hours playing it. Flow Free is a super fun challenging game that is hard to put down.
B002MQYOFW|5|Excellent - couldn't put it down and am moving quickly through the next two!!  A must read for everyone, no matter what age.
B000002P2V|5|First off, I don't think I understand everyone's complaints about the extra tracks on the re-released version of this album.  I myself own the original album without the extra tracks, but if only the added songs are  remixed and the originals are still the same, what is everybody's problem?    Getting beyond that ambiguity, I can tell you that the original 'Who Are  You' album is one of the best Who albums that the group put out.  Yes, it  certainly doesn't stick with their early formula electric  guitar/bass/drums/Daltrey, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Instead  you get the most 'orchestral' of the Who's albums.  Probably everyone used  to the early Who will have to listen a few times through this one to  understand it, but once you do, it stands out as something really unique.   Maybe I could describe it as prog-rock, I don't know.  I think it defies  categories.  What you have is Townshend's most intricate and most produced  Who album, and of the last three the Who put out, it's the only album that  succeeded in what it attempted to do. Final word: the best song on there is  NOT the title track, especially after we've heard it on the radio over and  over on the classic rock stations. Everybody has overrated that one and  underrated all of the other tracks.  Especially good: science fiction  '905', 'Sister Disco', and sometimes loud, sometimes soft, always vibrant  'Guitar and Pen'.
B004SJ3BCI|4|Been playing this game off and on while traveling. It is difficult and I enjoy the challenge. Love puzzle type games.
1616550414|5|I chose the five-star rating because this is a must have for any Zelda fan as this the book has extensive amount of info over the entire zelda series. Also, there are references to possible new games but this could just be the author making big wishes.
B003XF1XOQ|5|I loved this book but I did not like how Prim died.That was mean. I think Finnick was a good main character
0345803507|2|I would never recommend buying these books new.  There isn't a decent plot and I got bored reading the same thing all the time.
B003XF1XOQ|5|Love this entire series, I'm so sad that I've finished all three books. I wish Suzanne Collins would write more Hunger<br />Games!
B007KOMTUI|5|If you enjoy watching movies from the 60's and 70's; you'll really enjoy watching this series. It's got it all; temptation, lust, style, and the great idea's and tips on how to deal with clients on a professional and/or personal level. It's entertaining. The men and men from the old days where the women kept the house and took care of their men while the men went to work and provided for their family. The stylish decor and costumes are so worth the watch for women who appreciate the fashion of the 60's. It's a must see!
B00QROH0QK|5|Really awesome family movie!
B006T3RM08|5|I bought this to use with the Koolertron New Silver Aluminum Nottable Laptop Universal 360 degrees Adjustable Stand foldable stand. I have my laptop on the stand and I use my keyboard and trackpad on a desk board on my lap.<br /><br />I thought this item was very expensive, but not having to worry about the keyboard and trackpad sliding around and falling off the lap desk has been worth every cent. Having a nice sturdy holder makes it really easy to use my input devices and move them off the couch when needed.<br />Note that the &#34;on off&#34; button on the side does not work for me; not sure if that's a design issue or if my particular holder has a bug. I have not contacted the company about it because I don't care enough.<br /><br />If you buy this, maybe this will be obvious to you, but in case it is not: the way you assemble it is to lay the top part of your keyboard or trackpad in the holder and gently lower the bottom part into the tray. I thought it had to be snapped in or something. That's how you get them back out to change out batteries, too; simply lift the trackpad or keyboard top from the tray.
B008JFUNNM|5|:)
B002MQYOFW|4|Mistakenly saw the movie first. Book is great. This is coming from someone who never reads. I highly recommend it.
B0053O89KG|5|I have just started watching Castle reruns on TNT and have been pleasantly surprised on how good this show is. Now I'm addicted and my DVR is working overtime to catch up.  During the course of watching these episodes, I have notice some fairly big names that has made guest appearances.  I don't want to get into a new season without being completely caught up on the romance and murder plot of Becketts mom.
0440217563|4|I enjoyed this book immensely more than Dragonfly in Amber. It reminded me very much of Edgar Rice Burroughs' books in that it never stops moving. Just as the characters begin to get settled, something happens and they're off on another adventure. This book leaps from country to country, from time period to time period without ever giving the reader a chance to catch his breath.<br /><br />There were a few things that seemed kind of hokey to me, especially the re-appearance of a familiar character. Without spoiling who this returning guest is, I will say I did not like the sudden shift in the relationship between our heroes and this person. It was jarring and seemed too contrived.<br /><br />I loved the following passage where Jamie explains why he behaves the way he does, &#34;'If I thought there was a choice... then I maybe couldna do it. Ye dinna need to be so brave about things if ye ken ye canna help it, aye?' ... 'Like a woman in childbirth, aye? Ye must do it, and it makes no difference if you're afraid-- ye'll do it. It's only when ye ken ye can say no that it takes courage.'&#34;
B00G5G7EXY|5|REALLY enjoyed the movie... even bought the soundtrack.  saw it in the theater & knew I had to have it.  not as great as past Disney classics, but the songs are catchy & easy to sing along too.
B004DLPXAO|3|The app is very easy to used.  I really wish voice option could be added so that when I am not actually reading I can listen.
B00KNWYDU8|5|I have fun breeding adorable dragons ,and building the Dragon towers
B00HBQWGXK|4|This one strained character credibility more than any other. Otherwise a good yarn. I cannot explain the credibility issue without being a spoiler.
0812550757|2|Too sentimental, too much ethical blabla. Distracting use of Portugese.<br />Not anywhere near the quality of Ender's game, Ender's shadow.
B00EY7LT9Q|5|Great show worth watching no questions asked just want the next season to come out
B008Y2FRFO|5|Good game for the genre  my son is really enjoying it. It is a  good simulator of the deals arcade game...
B00B4804KS|5|I love Jurassic Park the movie.  For me it is worth to have it in all formats.  Especially the 3D format (If you have a 3D capable TV). Bluray and DVD formats are also included with this package.
B00CH26TL8|4|I LOVE the game on the computer, it is a little harder to play on  the kindle without a mouse.
B004FOA84A|5|My 9 year-old and I had a fun time with this game. It's very short, but a fun little adventure with straightforward, albeit bizarre, puzzles.<br /><br />I also got the other Manor title, and it's awful.
B00GAVJ77K|5|Very happy! Good results. Thank you
B000VYX8PE|5|I had chosen a 5 star rating because this author and story earns it.  I mean I feel really bad for the orphans but this is leaving me at the edge of my seat.  This ending was not at all happy but that's what I love about this book, it's out of the ordinary.  Lemony (the author) was talking to the reader it something you don't read much.  And how this book left me hanging was the best part, because I've never been so excited for a book in my life. I would recommend this book to a friend who loves to read books but she reads books that she doesn't pick out ,her mom does but her mom actually has a great taste in books so I hope she will be able to get this book on her kindle.
0385505833|4|I never read a John Grisham book before until my friend gave me this to read last week. I got it done in one night and enjoyed it. I felt like I knew the characters and how they reacted to certain incidents very well. I would read it again around Christmas time next year.
B00FB13Y74|5|My 6 year old enjoys this game, except he sees the in app purchases of new vehicles and frequently asks to purchase them. He complains that certain features aren't accessible unless certain cars are purchased. Otherwise he is very entertained by this game.
B000A7DVR2|1|I've heard about this movie for years.  Finally sat down and watched it, with great expectations.  Total disappointment.  I cannot believe this piece of junk is from the same guys who wrote Fargo.  This movie is so self-conscious and full of itself that its every attempt at humor is infused with desperation and heavy-handed \\"cleverness.\\"  Lots of profanity-laced, repetitive tirades masquerading as hilarious dialogue.  (Enough with the f-word already . . . it stops having any impact at all after the first few times and then just comes across as puerile and immature.)  What a waste of time of time and Oscar-nominated (in other films) talent.
B000KADH2S|5|I need to read it again. It's amazing. Dennis Prager mentioned it as a must read - I agree. I've sent copies to my three grown kids.
0399255370|5|This was a present for my youngest granddaughter to be read to her by her big sister.  My daughter said it was so cute and funny, both girls loved it.
B009FZHYKU|5|I cant tell you how much my husband and I love this show. We are on the edge of our seat with ever episode. Highly recommend it!
B00I8Q77Y0|5|I LOVE FLAPPY WINGS. It is a great app that is just like flappy bird. I found it because I was looking for flappy bird and when I couldn't, find it I found flappy wings and I am truly impressed.
B001CDZZI6|5|Great assessment tool that allows for great team building when done as a group.
B00GTCECVG|5|Subsidised kiddie.emissions .subsidise
B007L96SI6|4|I absolutely love Haley - she has the most amazing voice, style and charisma - I like the cd, and could never give Haley less than 4 stars, but I am disappointed that this cd is so over produced - her voice does not require anyone using a lot of electronics and mixing to make it sound better - it is like putting a lot of crappy sauce on a filet mignon or fresh swordfish - I hope her next cd is a more bare bones, t-bone burnett approach - with a couple old Ella Johnson, Helen Humes, Ruth Brown or Irma Thomas tunes Haley is amazing now and will only get better, but next time get the too many cooks in the kitchen/mixing room producers out of the way and let the soulful voice of Haley shine through
B002N7W3NK|1|THIS GOOD DIDIN`T COME YET. PLEASE SEND-ME A MESSAGE ABOUT POSTAGE AND HOW TOGE INFORMATIONS ABOUT WHEN IT IS GONNA BE QAVAILABLE IN MY HOUSE. I AM WORRIED ABOUT.
B00AREIAI8|5|Good interactive game for horse lovers especially young girls. Loved it. Excellent graphics as well. Lots of detail in caring for and training horses.
B00J59ZKV6|5|Close to the book
B004T4LUPW|4|install and setup with ease, syncs well, will give full review after more real world use. So far I can read, edit and add events. All shared calendars are shoeing and syncing as well.
B00E8KLWB4|5|I really really like this game. It keeps me occupied on rainy and boring days. Keeps my brain active and challenges my mind
B0000DJZA5|4|Fans may debate on and on about whether Let It Be...Naked is faithful to The Beatles' legacy and how it compares to the original and so forth. However, let's take a detached view about this for a minute. How does 'Let It Be...Naked' actually sound, as an album? Now, the answer to this question is, absolutely bloody fantastic. Rather than judging it on whats included and what isnt lets accept that this just sounds great (and for the record, I think its better than the original). <br />Earthy acoustic tracks like 'Two Of Us' are balanced out by almost garage-y tracks like 'I've Got A Feeling'. Other songs that were previously accompanied by cheesy choirs are stripped to their beautiful essentials. Let's face it: these are brilliant pop songs, in whatever form. The acoustic tracks are gorgeous and the rockers have a simple, driving appeal not present since the Beatles' early days (with the odd exception such as Revolution). <br />NME somewhat pretentiously called this 'the best garage rock album ever', but they have a point about the ethic of the album. Not a bad track really, whatever the detractors may say. The one thing I would say is that I'm not sure this needs to be added to your library if you have the original and the extra tracks on some sort of compilation. However, if you've not got the original, this is a top buy, and as far as I'm concerned, above buying a copy as it was originally.
B003UESJ9M|5|I found this movie to be very stirring and well acted. The fact that Paltrow can sing so well as well as Hedlund caught me by surprise. I ordered the CD and now have ordered the DVD. In the future I would love to see more of Paltrow and Hedlund in musicals. The movie ending of Paltrow was disappointing, but was happy to see that Hedlund and his new found love were brought together.
B009K0P10K|5|one of my most fav shows!  Excitement, intrigue and drama!  Can't wait for next season!  IF you haven;t seen this show, you must watch!

B007MNV5WU|2|would not let me download the app I got so excited whim I figured out there was a new angry birds so I was realy excited.
B005MW8CUG|5|I am a Smashing Pumkins fan from the old days.  I wanted to pick up this box because I read about the demos recordings in here that preceded subsequent recordings which wound up becoming the final SP Siamese Dream release.  I am extremely pleased with this purchase.  I really enjoyed hearing the demo recordings.  A bonus that I didn't even know was in here was an exceptional dvd of a Smashing Pumpkins performance in 1993.  Having recently seen the SP live in concert, I was extremely curious to see this concert footage from their earlier years.  I liked the concert footage better on the dvd in this package than the recent show performance that I saw.  Don't get me wrong, I really liked the Oceania concert recently, but in this DVD I see \\"Billy\\" in his prime historic launch as a rock star.  I was transfixed by the band's performance and Billy's energetic performance.  I see the look on Billy as he seemed to fully realize that he was arriving to an era of life when his years of hard work were about to hugely pay off.  The vibe from beginning to end in the concert performance is incredible. The audience knows the words to the songs and the place is a madhouse of fun.  I don't really care much for the little artsy cards.  I'm sure there's a meaning to them, but the meaning of this purchase for me was the music and it delivered.  I cannot speak to the quality of the Siamese Dream remaster because I didn't listen to it.  I really wanted this for the demos and as a bonus enjoyed the heck out of the unexpected dvd performance.
0307962520|1|Does Anne Rice pay people to write reviews on Amazon? I always see her ranting on Facebook about how Amazon costumer reviews are bullies. Is it being a bully to have an opinion. I must say I loved here pre 2000's work. Her idea that everyone still listens to ipods is absurd. But I mist admit I was excited for this book. I have not read it yet. How have the other reviewers have so fast seems fishy?
B00FAX6XQC|4|I love this game so much. The only thing I hate are the Prices.Other then that I love this game.
B00KWVZ750|5|The game is cool
B007ZGO7EM|5|Easy to use and easy to see. I tried a number calculators and none of them even come close to this one. Try it you will not be sorry. I use it every day.
B009GEFXLC|5|I love this show.  Hope they stay together and the show continues for many more seasons.  Not a real tv person, but this show has me hooked.  Stana Katic is mesmerizing.
B000Q9IZ5C|5|I was so disappointed that Firefly was cancelled.  So many unanswered questions.  But Serenity wraps most of it up considering they had a limited amount of time.  Well worth your time if you're a fan of the series.
B00006J3WH|4|If you liked the episode you will like the soundtrack. Of course it has a different feel to it but it's one thing to watch it and another just to hear it. It does have some slow points but it's a nice touch to add to a Buffy collection.
B00132D808|5|This ranks up there with the best of Van Dyke Parks or the Beach Boys' Smile/Pet Sounds or even Dan Hicks and his Hot Licks.  Way more musically complex and sophisticated than anything out there.  What floors me is how they can sell these kinds of numbers.
1607053888|5|I got this book last week and I made the large pleated zipper bag.  so easy and it came out great.  I can not wait to try the others in the book.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to make simple fun bags.  Beginners can follow these directions!
B0031KC8OC|5|I like the show, love the characters - even the ones that we all love to hate.
B00005JLR2|4|Treasure Planet is based off Robert Louis Stevenson's classic book, so it's hard to go wrong here. If you like Pirates of the Carribean, you'll like this, and so will your kids. It's a G-rated adventure tale with a bunch of steampunk-ish, sci fi trappings to move the story out of the past and into a fantasy future. There's nothing really wrong with this movie. It's very entertaining and you'll like the animation and character designs a lot.
B004BLDD9Y|5|Great price for a good LED bulb. Glad to see prices are coming down on LED's so we can replace those slow CFL's.
B00CAJMGDI|5|I love the album so much I am a bit at a loss as to how to even review it. Sorry people. To sum it up in one sentence would be. Its both soothing and energizing to listen to.
B00IG2DOKM|4|Fun game, inspires creativity.  Great distraction from day to day life.  I really like that you do not need friends to level up.  No hard sells for in app purchasing either.
B00KLUMS7C|5|I like the beat, now I just have to learn all the words. If Amazon ihas great items for less, why isn't  it the same for music purchases ? I pay the same price on iTunes. Someone there should look into music prices being cheaper,  Just a thought. Thank you, M.Tate
B004SQS9FA|5|So different from the Radiohead I have known, and I LOVE it, love it, love it.  I cannot tell you why in coherent, musical terms, I can only say their music grabbed me in a way music hasn't grabbed my mind in a very long time.  I am so energized and happy and feel like I can take on the world after hearing some of these songs, and I'm not even bipolar...other songs leave me pleasantly peaceful.  Why ese would I be here, downloading this music?
B000AMSSAW|1|Crap next time how about you sell proper region dvds that will work in America and not European okay well by now you must realize you can't sell this dvd in America simply won't work in any American dvd player Ya so yes I enjoy the film so much l had no option but to toss it in the bin after realizing it wouldn't  work so thanks for wasting my time fool me one won't fool me twice thanks
0545586178|5|This book is just amazing. I love how this one gets more political and even the twists and turns. Every page is just a cliff hanger. This book is a must read, along with the series as a whole. And after watching the trailer for of the movie being based off this.....holy smokes batman. This is going to be epic!!!
B00125WAWS|5|I used this film when I was teaching public speaking in high school.  It was not only good for some of the activities but also an excellent history lesson!
B008MG1E4A|5|As a simple citizen of this wonderful country, a big heartfelt thank you to all the men & women in our Armed forces! I read this engaging story in record time. i felt laughter, sorrow and was fueled by excitement. I would encourage everyone to read this ~ but be prepared you can't put it down.
B00BYOEMTQ|4|Great movie. Honestly a little slow for me at first. We previewed it for our eight year old and determined that it is too angst-filled and scary for him. The Orcs even gave me a heart-pounding nightmare! Great movie though.<br /><br />As far as watching it on Amazon... Tried it on our TV with our new HDMI cable and couldn't get a picture, only sound. Went to the computer to watch (15mb cable Internet speed) and could only get the small version to work without that jerkiness. So, we ended up hooking up the iPad to our speakers and watching it on that tiny screen. Boo, Amazon! We had limited time to watch it, so the waiting in between each new try and getting error messages was not fun. Amazon's email \\"tech support\\" was lame and Johnny come lately. Never had this issue before, but I wish they had sent a personal email saying, gee, sorry you had to watch this EPIC movie on your tiny screen with cables stretched across your living room for good sound. Here, have your $3.99 back and we're sorry. Ah, well, we will think twice before renting from Amazon on a Friday night!

B005ZOBNOI|5|I adored this book. I was unable to put it down. I read the entire thing in one day. This book is burned into my memory.<br /><br />The Fault In Our Stars is like my version of An Imperial Affliction. You may get this reference once you've read the book. ;)
B005OCFGTO|5|I bought this movie set along with the book set for my grandson who was 9 years old and he absolutely loves them. He has read the books several times and watched the movies several times too. He started by reading a book and then watching the movie to see how they differed from each other, now he just keeps rewatching.
B005SZADQS|5|Fantastic show with unexpected twists, keeps you on the edge of your seat with the lights on!  I LOVE it!  Great actors, fantastic plot.  I can't get enough!  (Not for children!)
B00JIHGK50|2|This product was very over priced and cheaply made, it was a Christmas gift and thrilled my granddaughter because it was Frozen, would not buy again.
B0000399WC|5|Definitely one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time, if not thee favorite.  A must see!
B009ZQC7MY|5|So easy! Phone to TV:))
0399226907|5|This book is bound to become a classic like `Goodnight Moon.'  It's a simple story of a little caterpillar who eats his way through a variety of foods, all the way through an apple and finally all the way through ten different snacks including an ice cream cone and a pickle; he gets an upset stomach, but he eats his way through a nice green leaf and is cured. But now he's a big, fat caterpillar and spins himself a cocoon and ultimately pushes out at a butterfly!<br /><br />The illustrations of the foods he eats his way through each have hole in the page and my little two-year old relative happily pushes his finger into each hole and is learning to count. It gives him an activity when the book is read to him. He and his father enjoy it because of the little drama and overacting they can do as the story progresses.  It's a really fine book for a two-year old.<br /><br />The book itself is printed on heavy, coated card stock and the illustrations are charming.
B000002IOW|2|&quot; Hold Your Fire&quot; culminated the 80's Rush, building on the innovations brought forth on &quot; Power Windows&quot;. I anxiously awaited this; the start of a new decade, with a new label and a different  producer from the last two records. What a dissappointment.

0545157617|5|I love reading Julia Donaldson books to my daughter.  They have such a nice rhythm.  It is also a lot of fun to try to find the characters from her other books in these books (Can you spot to graffalo and the cat?).  I've read it so many times that I have my own theory on what really happens to &#34;stick man&#34;.  Spoiler alert - I think he actually dies in the fireplace and the whole &#34;santa&#34; part is wishful thinking.  Of course I'm not telling my daughter or any child this version.  We read this book even when it isn't Christmas.
B006VRDZ44|5|Great docudrama of the east coast mob...also good to watch in conjunction with AMC's Beginnings of the Mob
0756404746|5|When I finished this book, I put it down and went to the computer to order all the author's other works.  I only found one other book, and ordered it.  Turned out, it was the same book, because he hadn't published any other books.  I didn't mind AT ALL paying for two copies of this book.  It is that good.

B00000IQW5|5|great movie...chick flick and funny for the guys
B004MKM8L8|5|I just got to watch this on DVD and it is amazing! I can't wait to see part 2. I have read the full series and thrilled with how the movies have turned out.
B00HBQWGXK|4|Jack Reacher novels are always enjoyable and this is no exception. They are getting a bit worn as the themes feel too familiar.
B00A9ET4MC|5|Satisfying read. Much like a long meal or a hot bath, it is good to the end. Recommend reading for everyone.
B005V2EVBQ|4|If you are looking for a minmalist cover this one is great.  Here's what I think about this item:<br /><br />1. This case does a great job at protecting both front and back of the kindle without adding bulk and weight.<br />2. The cover is held closed by an elastic band which is much like the first generation kindle cover I had experienced in the past and lasted for years without breaking.  I assume the same will happen with this cover.<br />3. To act as a stand, pull the cover back behind the kindle and fold it into a triangular stand and tuck the end into the back notch.  The stand appears to work fine.<br /><br />The (potential) negatives:<br />1. The back of this case is a sort of hard plastic and the kindle sits inside it.  Removing it from this once set in is a little difficult but can be done without issue.<br />2. The folding back of the cover to create a stand works fine now as it's new.  I just wonder with repeated use, how sturdy it will be.  If it breaks, I wll update this review.  I purchased and have begun using it the first week of December 2011.
B0011KQSZ4|5|This movie made me laugh until I cried.  It's really zany, stupid humor.  Not like Dumb and Dumber but absurd, mixed up stuff.  Maybe more like, A Fish Called Wanda.  This is my kind of humor, even though I had to turn the English captions on the first few times I watched it.  I'm not good with British accents.  A friend of mine once told me that the British find death really funny.  Don't know if that's true, but this movie kind of supports that idea.  Of course, part of the hilarity is that it all happens during a very serious event, a funeral, when you're not supposed to be laughing.  Even though it deals with death, it's not macabre.  I saw the ad for an American version coming out with a largely African American cast.  Don't think the American version will be able to pull it off as well, but I'll probably check that one out, too.
B007SY3CEW|5|I really like this app.  Hope they keep bringing more like this.  So nice to have the different levels.  You can work up to a higher level with practice which makes it nice for all ages.
B001GKJ2FW|5|love it
B000002BBY|5|This album offered the huge 1996 mainstream success of songs like Hello, Morning Glory, Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger and Champaign Super Nova. What makes this album so great is Oasis has a good British Beat, charming vocals and memorable lyrics about relationships and life. Hello starts the CD with a good introduction to the upbeat guitars, drum beats and a bit of sunshine in the lyrics. Roll with it is no chart topper, but its unique in its own right as singer Noel Gallagher takes a different singing tone, more of a whiney sound over some good drumbeats. Wonderwall is a thoughtful song, starting with a very soft strumming guitar throughout the entire song, making you focus on the vocals before a cello and soft drumbeat are added into the song. Don't Look Back In Anger kicks off with a piano and a simple drumbeat and eventually a guitar flutters in. Hey Now is slightly an Americanized rock song, but it is slow paced with a constant rattling beat. Some Might Say has a rocking guitar and happy lyrics about why people shouldn't wonder about things beyond life. Cast No Shadow is simply a slow melody, with some good backup singers, still singing about what is beyond life. She's Electric is a happier song, with some funny lyrics true to life about a girl that is pressing Gallagher into marriage. Morning Glory is a powerful song about how life is precious, kicking off with a good guitar and what sounds like a helicopter, before the beat starts up followed with \\"all your dreams are made, when your chained to a mirror and a razor blade.\\" Champaign Super Nova is a 7 minute song which finishes the CD with Gallagher's perspective of all he has been through. The untitled tracks are instrumental interludes, each lasts a minute. The only downfall to the CD is the songs last 5-8 minutes long with long instrumental bridges and intros.

B005DJREGQ|5|Awkward is awesome! This show kept me wanting to watch another episode again and again and again. Really glad I gave it a try.
B000YABV90|5|Some people hear the rhythm in a step, the strident beauty of a police siren, the whip of a powerline in the wind.  Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) doesn't get a decent night's sleep in the orphanage because of it.  His fellow inmates call him freak because he believes both his parents are living and they'll come for him--if only he call out with the music that connects them.      As he says, \\"I believe in music the way some people believe in fairy tales.\\" So, Evan decides after eleven years and some days to escape the orphanage and go find the music--and his parents.      Even ends up in New York City with zero street smarts.  He really doesn't even know how to cross the road. A fortunate encounter puts him near Arthur (Leon G. Thomas III), a street busker his age who's willing to help--for a price. Arthur introduces him to Wizard (Robin Williams) who gives musically talented street kids a place to stay in exchange for half their take. The Wizard quickly discovers that Evan, who he renames August Rush, is a prodigy and is making some plans for the lad.    Meanwhile, we learn that Even's mom Lyla Novacek (Kerri Russell) had only been with Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) one night. The Julliard educated cellist was in an accident while pregnant and her father decided to sign her name and give up her son--telling Lyla that he'd died.  Instead of the stage career her father envisioned, Lyla mostly gave up music and taught--til Julliard called her for a special concert in Central Park.    Louis has always longed for Lyla, the girl who got away.  He gave up his music and became a manager.  When he brings a girl to meet his family, they play a song he'd written for the band after Lyla's departure from his life.  He's determined to find Lyla.  When he believes she is married, he ends up in New York with no particular goals in mind except to find his music again.      \\"August Rush\\" is just as much about the musical ties that bind us as the three people whose stories ittells.  In my opinion, the best performances were the kids: Evan-August, Arthur and Hope (Jamia Simone Nash). This trio kept you captivated and cheering.      Of course, the soundtrack is fabulous.  You have Kaki King on the guitar as well as vocals from John Legend and John Ondrasik (Five for Fighting fame). I'm ordering the soundtrack tonight and I really don't often like movie soundtracks well enough to order.    I wasn't the only person who'd give this film 5 stars.  This is one of the rare films I've attended where many of the audience stood and applauded at the end.  While this is a family film, I did notice that some of the younger children got restless and needed some explanation of what was going on.
B005J3IEZQ|5|Not only is this a well written and personable read, it also helped me through a difficult time in my life as I battled cancer... This book has impact!
B003O86FMW|4|Unexpected plot twists. Strong female characters. I love that they figure out how to rebel against the capital. Lots of action.
034580404X|5|I read these books once and i let my mom borrow them and she borrowed them to others.<br />I never got them back. So i had to order more books for when i took time off of work to indulge in some Christian Grey!
1400032717|4|This is a novel written from the perspective of a mentally challenged fifteen year old. I think that Mark Haddon does a wonderful job in creating a wonderfully believable, challenged, yet intelligent and loveable character. He brings out empathy and understanding for the mind and persona of this young boy. The plot is entertaining and thought provoking, and even though it was simple, I found it satisfying. I recommend this book to those that enjoy a good and unique story. It is not a thriller, but it will captivate you.
B009AHWM5A|4|If you're a fan of the video game's then you will enjoy his movie. This movie does not follow or fit into the timeline of any of the motion pictures, strictly for fans of the games and the characters from the games.
B00DJFIMW6|5|Nice work on the best game ever.and it is a 5 star I love it. My first ayayand second time this season I have been the most important part of the world me .I love Christmas time because it is close to my b-dsy
B002MQYOFW|5|I loved this book!  It was very hard to put down and I bought the other two books in the Trilogy before I even finished this one!  Can't wait to see what happens next!  I am already half way through Catching Fire and I am loving that one so far as well. I would highly suggest this book to anyone that loves drama and adventure! Thank you Suzanne Collins for transporting me into another world, where I feel like I am jumping into the scenes and walking along side the characters, feeling their fear and sadness, as well as their anger for what the Capitol is forcing them to do. I am completely enthralled.
B00C1BU7V8|5|If you do not understand the American Political process this movie is a good learning platform.  The issues presented to Lincoln in the mid 1800's are no different those seen today, or that will occur in the future.  The titles of the issues today are money related but the underlying processes that the government runs on are based on the larger group opinion and the underdogs efforts to change the views of the majority.  Lincoln was a very interesting President indeed.  But you have to wonder, are the presidents today the result of money and not character?  I think money rules our governments, not the other way around.  Hence the Federal Reserve.  Americans need to be very afraid of money that runs governments from special interests that never show their faces publicly.  Poisonous times.  Electing politicians for a lifetime of service was not the intent of our founding fathers.  We need term limits to stop the mafias the D's and the R's conduct daily business with.  We need new faces, fresh ideas, we need leaders not puppets.
B00HGJ18C2|3|Ok
B002CPD5LM|3|Wow, there's no doubt that someone pulled out all the stops to produce this concert. The lineup of stars, from Petula Clark to Herbie Hancock is incredible. They are backed up by a first-rate rhythm section of seasoned American musicians and a big band comprised of young Swiss(?) players that does a very credible job. The music is wonderful too, with updated but familiar arrangements of Quincy Jones classics.    Unfortunately, the problem with this disc is in the recording. You'd think with this much money invested, and probably $100k of expensive microphones visible onstage, that they could have gotten it right. But they didn't... I listened to the DTS-HD Master soundtrack and was very disappointed, especially with the lead vocals. Maybe it was use of the wireless mics or the venue, but the lead vocals consistently sounded like they were coming from the next room. (muffled tone, more and/or different reverb than the rest of the band, not loud enough) It was bad enough that it very much detracted from my enjoyment of the concert. Too bad.
B003XF1XOQ|5|This book was so addicting I could not stop reading it. But it had a twisted ending. Read it yourself to find it out!
B00NW2KZYY|5|The game is simply loads of fun.

B004GJDQT8|4|Easy way to shop, most delivery have been quick, some a little slow.
B000WDSZ8E|5|I just watched the first two episodes on Amazon Prime. The show title sounds like it is a show about a family. I was surprised that it is more like Friends. I enjoyed the show and wished I had been watching it when it first came on TV.
B005GFPZYK|5|I read the book and thought the book was excellent. I then went and saw the movie and the movie was very well done.
B000ENWKN8|4|A slight departure for Rob Zombie, \\"Educated Horses\\" veers away from the electronic effects and the sampling, that were so prevelant on classics like the \\"Hellbilly Deluxe\\" album, on most of its songs, focusing on a driving, hammering, metal assault led by great distorted guitar-work and Zombie's distinctive (and increasingly versatile) vocal performance.  The electronic/sampling elements are still present, popping up to fine effect on tracks like \\"Let It All Bleed Out\\", while techniques not usually associated with Zombie - like soft/acoustic guitars - turn up fairly frequently.  The atmospheric instrumental \\"Sawdust In The Blood\\" - both haunting and menacing - opens up the album and segues right into the instantly memorable future classic \\"American Witch\\". <br /> <br />  Most of the lyrics on \\"Educated Horses\\" are on the vague side, sounding kind of like songs based on horror movies yet to be made.  Creepy, well-crafted, and sometimes with a lot of between-the-lines subtext, they're the kind of songs you can something different out of on subsequent listens.  The song on here based on a horror movie that Has been made, is of course \\"The Devil's Rejects\\", based on the second of Zombie's 'Firefly family' films.  It ties in to the movie in a disturbing way, seemingly a reflection on how the Rejects see themselves and the world around them.  \\"Foxy Foxy\\" and \\"The Scorpion Sleeps\\" are also standout tracks that deserve a special mention, although there's not a weak song on the disc. It's still got pretty much everything that made the previous albums work, but expands with new angles.  I think there's a definate influence from '70s classic rock on here, although that influence has been fed through a steam-powered grinder to come out distinctly Rob Zombie.  \\"Educated Horses\\" is a 4.5 star album containing much of Zombie's best music to date.
B00006LFGD|5|This CD is priceless .these lassu music will never die.. Yes I am a CD person I love my CDs<br />Love to look at my collections ( and I have an amazinig one..) nothing against the downloading
B00AREIAI8|5|Love the game and the graphics. Great for kids an adults. Not many games I like to play...but this one is a winner.
B004UJAOLM|5|Loved it from start to finish.
B00IX9UTLU|5|Good read
B00IDI7WP2|5|Both my boys love all the Lego movies this one is their favorite
B00000F1D3|5|I can't stop listening to Cher!  This is one of her best CDs yet!  The beat, the rhythms, and all the music, is and endless array of fun and dancing!  Put this CD in and you will be tapping your feet all day.  I enjoy working out to it, or even just listening to it in the car.  It doesn't get old.  There are some popular songs that you've heard on every radio station, like Believe... but there are some that you may have not heard... Get the CD, because THOSE are the songs that will blow your mind away!
B006LSZECO|5|Wow, this book has all kinds of twists and turns which leave you wondering what is around the next curve. Almost impossible to put down, the author is a master of developing one plot, then cleverly weaving it into area with new characters and tying them all together.This is a read that I would highly recommend.
B000053VAF|5|There are very few films were one can compliment both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in their acting efforts.  Besides \\"Good Will Hunting\\", this is another one of those efforts.  Cast of the movie is fantastic.  Alan Rickman is great in his role as voice of God and it is delightfull surprise to learn that the God is in form of beautiful and serene Alanis Morisette.  Chris Rock will not fail you as one of the \\"forgotten\\" apostole (13th one that happens to be black).  Unless you are an individual  too serious about your Catholic faith, or just too God fearing Christian in general, you will find this movie to be smart, funny and very entertaining.  I will be the first one to admit that I did not expect much of this movie and I got a very nice treat.  This is one of the comedies that you will always think of fondly  - if you are humble enough to laugh at yourself.  I believe that every one of us can see themselves or someone close we know in this colorful display of characters.
B00E72OKAS|5|Not a complicated  game but offers plenty of variety
B0067RQYNW|5|Works great
B00CWY76CC|4|This was a fun game. A little challenging but not to difficult. Need more floors though. Also a few hints would be helpful.
B00AB7HESI|5|This game is addicting! Very creative, fun for any age, but each level only takes around 30 seconds to complete, and at 50 levels, that isn't much playtime. Still a fantastic game and well worth the extra dollar for the new levels!
B00003CX5P|4|I think that scenically this movie is VERY Wondrous and Fantastic.  The many and various space cities and the space vehicles and the Space itself are just fabulous.  (The vroom-vroom music and sound effects are not, though.  I had to keep turning down the loud Speeding-and-Warring noisy-type music, and then I would miss what the characters said when they began to speak again.)<br /><br />(And the races and battle scenes seemed too long and drawn out.)<br /><br />I wasn't very fond of the great multitude of peculiar fantasy creatures.  I grew weary with the weird and comic quality of so many peculiar creatures as denizens of outer space.  Became surfeited with them and the fascinating other worlds after awhile.  The movie might have benefited from being just a bit shorter.<br /><br />On the other hand, I did enjoy all the robots very much--the way they were so much like real people.  Who cannot love R2D2, and the English-speaking, polite, butler-like robots like C3P02?  Even the evil robot warriers and the very tiny, evil, servant robots were very intriguing in their lifelikeness.  A lot of these fascinating robot characters, you have to look quick to catch a glimpse of them.  So much is going on in some of these scenes.<br /><br />Overall, creatively, this is a fabulous, sensational production.  All the scenes have an awesome vastness and are beautiful compositions.  Some of the costumes are interesting artistically.<br /><br />There are shades of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" in this movie.  Going into the big battle scene seemed copied right from it.  If you like the fantasy in LOTR, you can probably like it here (only there is a LOT more of it here).  And comparable to the DIGNITY of Aragorn/Stryder in LOTR, is the Jedi warrior played by Liam Neeson here.  I really LIKE him!  I think the character played by Neeson is fine and very sympathetic.  I couldn't believe that he died in the story!  No, no, to that; I wanted to see more of such an excellent character, good father-figure to young Anakin (who turns out unexpectedly to be a Christ-figure, for Heaven's sake!!)<br /><br />The Jedi reminded me of an order of priests with their great tradition and dignity.  In this story, there is a prophecy that the son of a virgin will restore balance to the ? society, or something like that.  I missed so much of the dialogue, I hardly know any details of the story.  Anyway, I really, really liked Anakin, too, the little boy who is the young Christ figure.  He will become Luke Skywalker in later episodes.<br /><br />This is a movie that will appeal to young kids and adults too.  (I mean it appealed to me, and I am an adult who is kidlike.)  And just looking at it without understanding the words that occur in the plot, a young person will understand which characters are clearly Good and which characters are clearly Evil--and they will wonder about the ones in-between that seem indecipherable.<br /><br />There seems to be a lot that is good about the movie.  But when I read a few of the 1-star reviews, I was able to both agree and disagree with the criticisms.  Overall, I am giving this episode a high rating because I thought the artistry was fabulous and the good Jedi characters were a very positive feature.  As far as I can tell, even though it tends toward some odd theological concepts, it could very well be a movie that instills just the usual age-old respect for Good triumphant over Evil.  (I haven't heard what church people say about the Star Wars Trilogy.)<br /><br />Well, I think it is indisputably a FANTASTIC movie, in the full sense of the meaning of the word.
B00CL66FEQ|4|It's a cute movie.Those with grown children will fine it to be true.<br />It shows that parents should live their own lives and let their grown children do the same.
B000HT3PPG|5|Brilliant
6304602979|5|Director Tony Scott shows what it takes for those who have found True Love.  This is a great film that proves it exists, but it requires a lot of violence to do it.  Not mindless violence, mind you...no, that wouldn't do.  It takes a special kind of violence, the kind that convinces the viewer that each lover is instantly willing to lay down his or her life for the other.  <br />Cynics keep telling me that True Love exists only in the hearts of Hopeless Dreamers.  Perhaps they're right.  I know it's something I've been looking for all my life, but have yet to find it.  However, Alabama Worley (Patricia Arquette) and her new husband, Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) succeeded, which must mean it's out there somewhere...Right?<br />From the first frame to the last, this film is unadulterated fun, very well done by an outstanding cast that includes Dennis Hopper and Val Kilmer.  If you haven't seen it, be sure to do so...you'll love it.  If you've seen it before, see it again...and this time, don't forget the popcorn and your girlfriend
B008SAZHLQ|5|Rainbow Rowell was able to capture the ups and downs of a teen romance in this well-written book.  The book is set in the 1980s...the time period when Rainbow was a teenager.  I would guess this book is loosely based on her own experiences as a teen.  The book takes the reader back to his/her own teen years...(which I would rather read about than experience again).<br />  Eleanor's life reminds us that we don't know what is going on in someone else's life when we make our judgments about him/her.  The book is written for teen-agers, but it can be enjoyed by adults as well.
B00005JN2Z|4|I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this movie.  It was refreshing to see Tom Cruise play bad guy, and Jamie Foxx is terrific as a cabdriver caught in the middle of his scheme.  Tom Cruise is Vincent, a hit man who essentially forces Jamie Foxx, his cabdriver, to take him from one hit to the next as he attempts to kill 5 people in one night.  Things change when Jamie Foxx's character realizes that Vincent's final victim is a woman (Jada Pinkett-Smith) Foxx had met earlier that day.<br /><br />The movie takes place over less than 10 hours, and as a result has a very high-energy, crazed feeling.  You find yourself viewing the story from the perspective of Jamie Foxx's character, and I certainly wondered quite a few times what I might do if I was in the same situation.  Cruise and Foxx are excellent, and once the story picks up you are completely engrossed through the conclusion.
B00FGEO9NE|5|This show has me hooked. My wife watched the whole first season in 2.5 days. It is one of those shows that leaves you on the edge of your seat to where you will sacrifice the sleep to watch another episode. I was putting off watching it and when I started I just simply could not stop. This show will unravel at an excellent pace and not be that hard to follow. You might have to watch some episodes twice, but you will love every second.<br /><br />I will not play spoiler at all because this show is just too good and you need to watch it. Every single person I tell about this show furiously texts me thanking me for putting them onto it. I have friends who called out of work sick to watch 2 seasons in 4 days.<br /><br />If you have Showtime it might be on demand for free. I would definitely check there first to see how many seasons are on there. You will not be disappointed though with the DVD's and they deserve the revenue for making such a brilliant show!

0316227706|5|A talented photographer, Seth Casteel, takes the most stunning photographs.  He not only takes these marvelous pictures, but he shares his talent in teaching other photographers.  From what I have read he teaches not only the underwater photos, but he teaches photographers to take pictures of animals in shelters.  The photos of animals, in shelters, make them look less sad, and through these pictures more animals are adopted!!  This is a good thing, and I have to respect someone who gives back.  I can't wait until his next book comes out!!

B004LOMB2Q|5|Great app works great on the Kindle fire and the best part is that there is a Plug in for Google Chrome called Cleary that clips out an article right out of a web page packed with ads and sends only the article to the evernote account so you could view it on the Kindle Fire.
B0042U94UQ|5|This is the best movie ever. Its great for kid but adults like it too.<br />I actually ordered this for my boyfriend who just loves animated movies and collects them.<br />I also bought the 2nd movie and like it even more.
B002QE3CTY|5|A new YA classic. Fans of Hunger Games, don't miss this one. Recommended for boys who think they don't like books.
B00J0LH0XK|5|This is an update from the 2001 Amsterdam 25th reunion tour.  Nathan East plays bass as Mike Pocaro has chronic health condition.  The stand out is  Steve Lukather on vocals and guitar.  Satisfying
B00006FDCD|5|Great movie
B0084B5TK8|5|Bram Stoker was a very creative writer. It is hard to believe he was bed bound the first 7 years of his life for unknown cause. Very creative imagination.
B00957T6X6|5|I bought these as first books to my Kindle and because I've seen the tv-series. I love the universe, and the books are even better than the tv-series!
B004UXUX7S|5|Video came before the day it was supposed to arrive. The blu-ray qaulity was great, and it really pleased me to see this fabulous film once again. Reminds me of the time I spend on the island every year.
B005OCFGTO|5|Film simply doesn`t get any better than this!  Amazing directing, great actors, awesome effects and most important  of all - a truly mind-blowing story.....
B004J1DBJI|5|This app knows everything! I use it to look up formulas, statistics, and other facts quickly and easily. It has an intuitive interface that loads and runs quickly on my Samsung Galaxy S. 5 stars!
B00003CXCT|5|If you like Star Wars this trilogy is a must
B0011Z76RS|5|this album was great awsome alternative/rock that 1 star review got this wrong with some other album but this was a great album. All their albums were great exept for minutes to midnight that album sucked but this album was awsome.
B003QSLW0K|5|need I say more, its lilo and stich for gods sake, I sing along to the moves in my attempt to speak something I don't understand...
B0091REZMW|4|its a fun game<br />worth the time to play with good art and a lot of different play. the story line is not advanced but still fun.
B00870Z9HY|2|I had so enjoyed the phantom and hum the tunes even now. The sequel has wonderful singers, beautiful sets, great orchestration, and a dramatic story to tell, but the music doesn't sing in my head. Not a disappointment, just not the stellar music of the original.
B009C7ZQM4|4|This came with my new phone and I liked it so much I'm now using it on my. both my kindles.
0060775858|5|This book was a gift for a one year old child. I loved reading it to her and it was not a book that she had.<br /><br />I was very happy with the purchase.
B00ESNDQWY|5|Can't wait for Season 6.  Complete surprise in Season 5.
B0000E1WKE|4|Her holiday album is here.  Whitney comes back to her choir girl roots, and the result is pleasing.  Not unbelievably good, but very good.  She may have been through a lot personally, but her voice sounds rich and strong.  <br />The song featuring her daughter is a special gift and mothers will find it touching.<br />It is a traditional album which would be good for playing during tree-decorating, cookie-baking days.  Also nice for the car ride at night to look at lights.  A little less of a party background CD, because people would listen to the CD instead of talk. Overall, enjoyable Christmas music from a Whitney we have missed.  She can still sing.  Welcome back.
