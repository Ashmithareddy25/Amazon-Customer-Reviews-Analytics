B000005DSN|5.0|This album is full of beatiful classical melodies that you will be caught by its composition.Timo Tolkki made a EXCELLENT job in this album.Also Jens Johannsen,with his extraordinary playing,made this cd the BEST neoclassical  cd I've ever heard.If you don't buy this cd,you will be in shame for the  rest of your life!!
B000000W9Z|5.0|Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, Smashing Pumpkins, and scores and scores of bands have been influenced by Bowie, yet in their clever reinventiveness they have yet to equal his understanding of isolation, atmosphere, and  visual imagery. Outside is one such album.
079073639X|3.0|The movie afterwards let's you think that every god should have a tool like this.You can't really classify this movie but it is scifi and will make you think what really happend.Didn't it??
B00000HYSN|5.0|As another reviewer said, this album is beyond classification other than to say that it is a classic of one type or another.  Incidentally, the album has 8 or 9 songs, not just the two that are listed above.
1573225517|4.0|Hornby is the best I've read in years! Funny, refreshing, Hornby brings humor, insight and relevance to any subject he tackles (ie. football in Fever Pitch, and now music in High fid) and all the while, provides  embarrisingly accurate accounts on the male psyche, cleaverly confirming  what we females have suspected all along. For people who enjoy something  different, High Fidelity will be a rewarding read.  It will make you laugh,  cry (cause you've laughed so much), and wish that you'd discovered Hornby  so much sooner.
B00000I8UE|5.0|I'd heard much about Cassandra Wilson before buying this CD, but hadn't actually heard anything from her.  Truly a wonderful listening experience.   &quot;Right here, right now&quot; is in my all time favorite list.  An  excellent jazz recording for non-jazz fans.
6305263248|2.0|If you have a good surround sound system in your home, this has killer sound.  As a movie, it is banal, boring and plain silly.
0441003257|5.0|If you like Douglas Adams, you will love this book
B000002MNR|3.0|Yes, this is just stuff MK wrote for films and most of it is rather boring for the most part, but if you want to hear a beautiful song, listen to &quot;Victims&quot;, which in my opinion (and I own ever Dire Straits and  Mark Knopler album) is the best song he has ever written.  There are no  words or singing - and no guitar - just violins and a cello.  Let me tell  you folks, it may be the most beautiful song that's ever been  written.<br />The rest of the album is great for reading or something -  there's really not a lot on here that's really noticable (I am surprised  they left off &quot;The Rocks and the Water&quot; from Cal, which was a  very decent song).  Anyway, just my 2 cents.
B000002UWF|5.0|I always liked Prima and the gang and this collection points out the reasons why!! Louie's infectious craziness, Keeley Smith's wonderful voice, Sam Butera's great booting sax, and that bouncy hybrid  swing/dixieland/Italian/boogie woogie beat !!! You MUST tap your foot and  feel good when you play this CD...get it and consider it your own  stress-buster. For anyone, any age, anywhere!!!!
B000002MU3|5.0|This album rocks, it proves that they were not imitators, but that they can expand their horizons and do stuff that they hadn't prieviously done.  In 1994-95, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Nirvana etc.  were all over the radio and MTV,  and this incredible band who previously  had done nothing but dreamy melodic love songs and real poppy stuff like  &quot;Stand&quot; comes out with an album just as creative and  &quot;hard&quot; as the albums out at the time from these other bands.  I  will buy that &quot;true&quot; REM fans that fell in love with the band in  the mid-1980s probably didn't enjoy this album as much as some others, but  don't knock the creativity and success of this album just because you  wanted them to make songs like &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot; there whole  careers.  This  album and its heavy follow up &quot;New Adventures in  Hi-Fi&quot; both rock!!!
0671867369|5.0|As an ex-Marine I was reminded of Admiral Nimitz's words regarding Iwo Jima, &quot;Uncommon Valor Was a Common Virtue&quot;.<br />The men of &quot;E&quot; Company were ordinary &quot;Joes&quot; in the sense that they  all represent &quot;us&quot;, but they were of a different breed. Men who  understood the challenges before them and wanted to be the best there could  be to face them.<br />Mr. Ambrose has provided us all with a wonderful piece  of our history and our &quot;civilian&quot; fighting men. Enough words  cannot possibly be said about that generation and the hardships, suffering,  loss and death they endured for us.<br />It's one of the best WWII histories  in recent memory.
B000001FTQ|5.0|La mejor interpretacion de Bono para esta cancion, el bajo retumbante de Adam completan la cancion, los efectos y guitarra de The Edge insuperables y la percusion por Larry excelente. Un excelente CD que no debe faltar en  la coleccion de un U2 fan.
B00000JLX0|5.0|The movie Titanic is an epic love story brought to life on the doomed maiden voyage of the grandest ship in the world. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet bring to life Jack and Rose, the lovers that would let nothing come  between them. The love story touched my heart the no other could and the  historical story was tragic and relived in the movie. THIS MOVIE MUST BE  SEEN!!
B00000IQMT|4.0|I remember walking out of the theatre after my second viewingof Episode I.  I went straight to Sam Goody and bought thissoundtrack.  I own all of the Star Wars soundtracks, but keep coming back to this one.  It's a great, fresh new take on Star Wars.  John Williams has come a long way since Return of the Jedi, and this CD is proof.  From the menacing &quot;Duel of the Fates,&quot; to the fun, playful &quot;Augie's Great Municipal Band,&quot; to the quiet, mysterious &quot;Anakin's Theme,&quot; this CD has what every great soundtrack should.  I only rated it a 4 because it was, sadly, missing 3 tracks: the moving, powerful rendition of the Force theme played as Qui-Gon takes Anakin from his mother to begin his Jedi training; much of the music played during the space battle in which Anakin participates; and the music played when Qui-Gon and Darth Maul first do battle on Tatooine. But, overall, this CD is must for any fan of classical/soundtrack music!  p.s. did anyone else notice that track 12, &quot;Panaka and the Queen's Protectors,&quot; contains some of the theme from Jaws...?
0345423496|1.0|After reading 2061, I had a nagging feeling that AC Clarke was going insane.  Well, 3001 confims it beyond a doubt.  It's sad to see an author slowly lose his skill and interest.  If this were submitted for publication  by a lesser-known author, it would have gone straight into the trash.
0131103628|5.0|This book is very complete and will help clear up any questions you have.  After you have an understanding of C functions and syntax, you should definately purchase this book.  The best beginners' book, that even a  non-programmer can learn C from, is Teach Yourself... C (Second Edition, By  Charles Siegel).<br />Bottomline: This book is compact and complete, and is a  must have for anyone serious about programming in C.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  This movie was just plain fun, it grabs hold of you and doesn't let go.  When the movie ends you will be surprised at how good it is.  The amount of immersion that  this movie brings is unbelievable, I never once looked at my watch.  (I  have noticed that the overwhelming majority of reviewers enjoyed this movie  with a few detractors, maybe this movie was a little deep for some.  (Who  knows?))  It has been awhile since I have had as much fun watching a movie.   The story itself was alot deeper than most action/sci-fi movies ever  strive for.  What an incredible concept, this movie challenges each veiwer  to question what reality is.  What is the Matrix?  The best Sci-Fi Movie of  the Year.  It is a must buy on DVD and one I will pre-order right now.
B000001GKC|5.0|The very last Karajan recordings, like this one, and the last 3rd and 4th Brahms symphonies ( also first released in 1989 ), present a whole new Karajan. Not so ambitious of proving to everybody he's the very best, and  not so technical-perfection minded anymore, Karajan lets the music speak  for itself, without forcing any extra energy on it, and the result is sheer  beauty, of the kind we rarely find in any kind of art work,  something that  really takes you to other worlds, with mountains of beauty and erupting  emotions. And it's a totaly new kind of beauty, not usually found in  Karajan's earlier recordings. This recording is invaluable for any music  lover, and a must for any Karajan admirer.
1878574590|3.0|I'll pretty much try anything Frank Miller puts out, and I highly anticipated this story in its original serialized form.  Even though the ending, and the writing in general, was pretty poor, I still enjoy it for  the action and art, especially the &quot;handcuff fight&quot;.<br />Miller  took a whole new direction with this story by turning to crime-noir in  stark black and white.  The problem is that this is pretty much ALL he's  been doing for the past 8 (?) or so years: Sin City ad nauseam.  And trust  me, the stories and art only get worse.  Enough already, Frank, there's  only so much hard-boiled macho garbage I can take.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I cant stand hearing how blink is now trendy cuz they play their stuff on the radio. its such bull. Blink 182 has certainly not sold out and become trendy. not in the least bit.  This cd shows how they have stayed the same.   I cant stop listening to this cd..in fact, im listening to it now. Buy  this one
B000002MY3|5.0|The song &quot;You Learn&quot; first drew me to this CD.  It is one of the strongest and most hauntings set of lyrics to be combined with a superb melody.  If this were the only song I liked on this CD the CD would still  be very highly recommendable.  But there are many more, some released and  others not -- making listening to Moresset's efforts a true treasure hunt  -- that causes me to say this one of the most prized finds I've made in  several years. Superb effort!
B000002GYG|5.0|I have seen Tom Waits perform in New Orleans, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, NYC, and San Francisco over many years, and he has always come through with a great show. Even when he showed up in Philadelphia without his band (as a  result of a group arrest after the previous night's show), he came through  with a great acoustic performance. So. . . here's your chance to experience  his show from the Seventies for yourself. Yes - I heard it was a studio  recording as well, but that knowledge doesn't detract from the recording's  allure, since it was done in front of a live audience in a big studio. The  intent was to get get good sound quality, not stack the deck in terms of  staged audience reaction.<br /><br />If you're concerned about authenticity, let me  assuage your fears. As someone who has seen Waits perform over 20 times, I  can tell you that what you hear on this disc is what you would have heard  in 1975 if you had seen him in person.<br /><br />Great disc - I recommend it highly  for both long-time fans as well as Tom Waits novices.
B00000K2SE|5.0|The Matrix is by far the most fantastic sci-fi epic I have ever seen in my whole life!!  It far supercedes any of the other competition in the same genre by spreading new horizons within the chapter of great filmmaking as  well as state-of-the-art special effects.  Great chemistry between Keanu  Reeves and Laurence Fishburne...trippy storyline...hot chick that  Carrie-Anne Moss!  What a babe!!  There are rumors that a sequel might be  coming out??  I'm there the day it comes out, baby!!
B00000FCBC|5.0|It seems everyone either loves or hates this one.  I thought it was a lot of fun, myself.<br />The main problem with the previous releases (Load/ReLoad) was the sheer lack of energy in Metallica's delivery.  My favorite aspect  of this album is that you can really hear Metallica having fun.  It makes a  big difference.  I was also happy to hear the old tighter guitar sounds  back.  Drums sound hard-hitting again.<br />Musically and sonically, this is  the best one since The Black Album.  If you didn't get the  &quot;tounge-in-cheek&quot; vibe to some of the tracks, then maybe you're  taking this all a little too seriously.
0670858048|5.0|What a unique, thought provoking book.  Just shows what you see is not &quot;as it appears&quot;.  LOVED IT! Giving it to everyone I know at Christmas.
0375707972|3.0|Is Hanna not culpable, due to her illiteracy, for her crimes? Is Hanna's illiteracy a metaphor implying that Germans perpetrated the Holocaust simply out of ignorance?  Many of the perpetrators of the Holocaust were  educated and &quot;cultured,&quot; so it doesn't seem that the metaphor is  apt.  Maybe, the point that Hanna's illiteracy is trying to indicate is  that education doesn't protect one from committing a crime.  Also, one can  easily justify their crime behind the mask of intellectual reasoning.   Education can act as a shield, as an excuse.  Hanna stands naked in her  wrong doing. This book belongs in the tradition of &quot;Sophie's  Choice,&quot; books that focus on the Holocasut, yet do so from a gentile  position.  Does the fact that both Sophie and Hanna are anomalies, Hannah  in her illiteracy and Sophie as a Polish Catholic, make light of atrocities  of the war and therefore diminish its horrors?  I don't think so.  Even  though all of the Holocaust's victims were Jews (the final solution, which  the defining element of the Holocaust, was for only Jews), others suffered  from the war. Their story is  valid, and they have the right to tell it.   Through fiction, the reader can become sympathetic towards the perpetrator  of a crime.  However, to deny one's humanity is wrong.                               -Sarah
B000002MH5|5.0|Dinosaur Jr fans tend to be split into two camps:  those who favor the early, Lou-Barlow-era underground sound of Bug and You're Living All Over Me, and those who prefer the fuller, more finished sounds of the J  Mascis-centric Green Mind and later albums.  To me, it's all so good that I  can never decide which I like better.  But although I've listened to every  album at least a thousand times, Where You Been has always been the one  that staggers me.  With an unconscious, sleight-of-hand genius for song  structure and melody, Mascis created the strongest songs of his career.  Although less driven by impulsive inspiration than some earlier stuff (like  The Wagon), these songs are more finished, and Mascis has brought in an  uncanny knack for instrumentation to add layers of mood to otherwise simple  songs.  Out There, for instance, is just a basic five-chord folk  progression, but those static guitars and stop-rhythms turn it into an  epic.  Start Choppin, On the Way and Hide are so original that there is  simply no analog to them in contemporary music.  I have to close with a  tribute to Not the Same, the mysteriously oft-maligned ballad; I don't  think I've ever heard a sadder or more beautiful song.  The whole album  leaves me in awe.
B000002C1W|5.0|This album isn't as bad as almost everyone's making it out to be, in fact, it's pretty good. Most of it sounds like movie music. I like every track on here, even the instrumentals like &quot;Terminal Frost&quot;. If you're a  true &quot;Floyd&quot; fan, then you will appreciate this sophisticated  work of art. It dosen't sound like most of their 'classic' stuff, but it's  still a decent album, and it's a hell of alot better than the music of  today. My favorites are: &quot;Dogs Of War&quot;, &quot;One Slip&quot;,  &quot;On The Turning Away&quot;, &quot;Yet Another Movie&quot;, both  &quot;A New Machine&quot;, and &quot;Sorrow&quot;. <br />I can't really speak  for anyone, but my best advice for anyone who reads these reviews and is  thinking about getting this album should just try it and find out for  yourselves whether you like  &quot;A Momentary Lapse Of Reason&quot;,or not  because you can't always depend on other people's  opinions.<br />Thanks,<br />4.12.20, 4/18.
0152465030|5.0|A workful art of prose and innocence, blended with acts of courage, charm, wonder and grace.  An perpetuate volume in its ability to illicit thought and logical reason from readers of all ages.  The very base of philosophic  logic and ponderance abounds throughout the simple verbage.
078322706X|5.0|I am astonished at the number of reviews for this movie, it clearly made a  great impact on a lot of people, including me. Yes yes, I heard all the  negative reviews from critics last year, I know it bombed at the box  office, and romances are not top of my list as film choices go. I remained  open minded, however, as I have enjoyed the vast majority of BOTH leading  actors work. As it turned out, I will be honest and say I had trouble  getting into it...for the first ten minutes! Why? I felt Anthony Hopkins  was not totally convincing me, but after this initial uncertainty he  suddenly found his form and maintained it throughout the remainder of the  film. What a great film too. I was expecting to be entertained by Hopkins  and Brad Pitt, but this film just got better and better for many additional  reasons. The supporting cast were uniformly excellent, the story of Death  (Pitt) deciding to take human form on Earth, (to experience life, love, and  peanut butter), entertaining, and at times gently amusing, the love aspect  between him and Hopkins' daughter not at all sickly, (though I do wish Ms.  Forlani had tried to widen her range of facial expressions!), but best of  all some of the dialogue, which really drew me in and was quite emotionally  rewarding (and really hit home personally a couple of times), leading to a  final forty five minutes or so where I was totally bound up in the  situation, which was so cleverly resolved, when it had seemed impossible to  do so! To the lovers of this movie, (the majority of which I sincerely  doubt are silly teenagers who adore Brad Pitt and nothing else), I am glad  you gave it a chance to shine. To the critics, (reading some of the reviews  here was almost as entertaining as the movie...hmmm...maybe not!), I was  very disappointed in your lack of reasoning. There is no getting away from  the fact that Brad Pitt is an attractive man, why does this make people  jealous enough that they accuse his acting of being sub-standard? You all  go on about poor Mr. Hopkins being embroiled in a nonsense film way below  his talents, with Pitt the main protagonist in this offence, infact both  are excellent parts of a fulfilling whole. One reviewer did make a worthy  remark, that saying 'patience will be rewarded' is tantamount to saying  'survive the dross and you'll love the ending', where infact the whole film  must be rewarding to adulate it. However they chose the wrong film to  attach such a statement to, as clearly it is extremely rewarding  throughout. Finally as to length at three hours. I don't argue that the  film HAD to last that duration, what I do say is that it does not matter  that it did. It is rediculous to say the film was boring because it was so  long. If you didn't find the story compelling I doubt any amount of editing  would have lead you to enjoy it.  I do know that a majority of people find  a two hour film about all they can endure. Even a smash hit like  Independence Day, at forty minutes LESS than 'Meet Joe Black', was  considered overlong by a lot of my friends,(I felt it could have been a  little longer). If you love a film why do you want it to end? To the  reviewer who feels sorry for me and others for giving this film five stars,  when it is their opinion c**p, your two line critique indicates your lack  of genuine opinion, or maybe, as with the film, you just like to get things  over quickly! To others with open minds, take a chance here and you'll be  amply rewarded
0790729989|5.0|An absolute masterpiece,  a beautiful blend of horror and mild black comedy,  Seven has , and will be for years to come,  been on top ten movies of the week,  month and year...soon to be a hot classic.  Brad Pitt and  Morgan Freeman do a very well illistrated,  understandable and touching  portral of a Killer out to reinstate the 7 deadly sins by murdering those  who disobey them.  Gywenth Paltrow and Kevin Spacy have minor co starring  roles but the real credit goes to director Daive Fincher (The Game,   up-coming Fight Club),  who paints New York in the bleakest of bleak ways  and gives the movie a very unique touch.  A very sad, down-to-earth movie,   it deserves to be a must see.
B000002UAO|5.0|&quot;Drive My Car&quot; needs a bit of a jump start, but for the most part the lyrics on the album are incredibly well thought-out and show some of the feeling that was suppressed by the search of a marketable pop song.  &quot;In My Life&quot; is probably one of the greatest songs you'll hear,  and &quot;The Word&quot; established the ideals of the hippiedom to come  well before it arrived. &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; is a great three part  harmony with Lennon's autobiographical lyrics (which would incomprehensibly  become a song from the acid-trip that was the film &quot;Yellow  Submarine&quot;) while &quot;You Won't See Me&quot; showcases Paul writing  songs like Lennon's on &quot;Beatles For Sale&quot; (i.e. depressing  break-up.) They had clearly expanded musically and lyrically, and this was  close to their height as an actual group, it's almost perfect. None of the  songs really compromise the rock sound that made them so popular in the  years before (excepting &quot;In My Life&quot; which is understandable; and  the minimalistic &quot;Michelle&quot; which would form the basis for Paul's  &quot;Revolver&quot; genius) and they really began to influence their  peers. The Beach Boys modeled their highly praised (though dramatically  overrated) &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; after this album; Brian Wilson saw it as  a challenge: all songs were original, artful and insightful. I dare you to  find a bad song (although John, for some reason, named &quot;Run for Your  Life&quot; as his worst song; I always saw it as sarcasm). Not their best  album to be sure, but one giant leap for Beatledom. The next album would  build upon the themes this one layed out, and blow the world away with  incredible innovation that ensured that '60s music definitely would not be  lame.
B00000JJSK|5.0|I wrote my previous review on the basis of hearing two tracks. I was convinced from those that this CD would be a belter. It is a belter! Think AC/DC done by the Cult, but better. Final track - You Wish - is probably  the best possible hybrid of When The Levee Breaks by LedZep and 3 Days by  Janes Addiction. Quite simply, no rock record will touch Unida this  Millenium now. Buy a copy for everyone you know, they'll love it and thank  you for it.
B000002UAR|5.0|This is their greatest album. While age has somewhat tarnished the genius that was &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; you still drop your jaw on the floor when you hear these songs today. Paul  McCartney dabbled in his own minimalism with &quot;For No One&quot; and  (John Lennon's favorite &quot;Revolver&quot; tune) &quot;Here, There, and  Everywhere&quot; with stunning and beautiful results. You FEEL this music.  George truly begins his life as a songwriter, contributing three well  crafted songs made great with George Martin's brilliant production.  &quot;Taxman&quot; rings truer and truer as the years roll by, and no one  has ever not experienced the feelings &quot;I Want to Tell You&quot; give.  Lennon begins writing acid-rock, &quot;Dr. Robert,&quot; &quot;And Your  Bird Can Sing,&quot; and &quot;She Said She Said&quot; showcase a  stripped-down version of where they were headed with &quot;Sgt.  Pepper&quot; while &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; is just pure magic;  avant garde mastery with a brilliant vocal performance singing  metaphorically...you simply cannot ingnore the song. So many tricks. The  album is simply perfect, with something for everyone (though it is  thoroughly acid-soaked.) Unfortunately, it also shows the very different  directions they were heading in that would lead to their split, but for now  they're at their height as a recording group and at the height of their  creativity. Though not a concept album as their next magnum opus would be,  this is quite possibly the most thoroughly influential album in the  catalog.
0792156684|3.0|I loved this movie, but I was disappointed by the DVD.  After having to wait so long before Titanic was even released on DVD, I would have liked to have seen a lot more extra features.  There really are none to speak of,  outside of closed captions and spanish and french audio.  Additionally, I  was amazed that a movie that runs 3 hours and 20 minutes would be broken  down into only 30 scenes in the scene selection menu.  Nevertheless, I am  excited to have this movie in digital format!
B000002UAC|3.0|When you compare this record with his predecessor your comparing 2 different worlds -- released only 8 months after &quot;please please me&quot; , &quot;with th beatles&quot; is a significantly more consistent  and better album . The opening-triade (it won't be long , all I've got to  do , All my loving) matches up to their finest work . &quot;Don't bother  me&quot; is a good Harrison song , no &quot;While my guitar...&quot; not  even a &quot;Taxman&quot; , but still a good debut from a beginning  guitarist .&quot;Little child&quot; is a serviceable rocker .&quot;Please  mr. postman&quot; and &quot;Till there was you are&quot; both good covers .  Side 2 is practically as good as side one . &quot;Not a second time&quot; ,  &quot;I wanna be your man&quot; (which Mr.Mac sold very clever to the  Stones) and &quot;Hold me tight&quot; are good to very good early songs .  &quot;Roll over Beethoven and Money (which remembers me of &quot;Twist 'n  shout) are delightful covers and I also enjoy the underrated &quot;devil in  her heart&quot; , pulled to a higher level by the brilliant interphrase  &quot;no this I can't believe&quot; . Also check out the great 3-part  harmonies in the Smokey Robinson cover (which reminds me a bit of their own  , Robinson-inspired &quot;This boy&quot; ) &quot;you really got a hold on  me&quot; .
006092988X|5.0|I had to read &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;A Separate Peace&quot; for sophmore English.  I read &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; first because it was longer and I wanted to get it over  with.  It is my favorite book now (and I don't read that often).  I didn't  even read &quot;A Separate Peace&quot; because I reread &quot;A Tree Grows  in Brooklyn&quot; so many times.

0671578278|5.0|First let me say that I have read every book in this series, every one of them has been outstanding.<br />As I was reading this book, and I was only a couple of chapters into it, I figured that Ms.Bojold had finally slipped.  It was not anywhere up to her standards. It took me 4 sittings to read the  first couple of chapters, BUT all of a sudden I was pulled in, and on the  5th sitting, I read the rest of the book in one night. <br />All I can say is  congratulations to Ms. Bujold. Another fantastic story.
0790739356|5.0|This may be Kurt Russell's best performance.  The most difficult thing for an actor to get across to an audience is what is or isn't going on in his mind and heart.  Kurt pulls it off in fine style from beginning to end  including the realization that his &quot;enemy&quot; 607 is simply doing  what he was bred to do...destroy whomever when ordered without question.   Kurt's character feels and expresses the regret he feels even when breaking  his antagonist's neck.  &quot;Soldiers deserve a soldier.&quot;

6305132984|5.0|My &quot;cult movie&quot;, as we call it in France, since 15 years old. Seen more than 18 times, I'm always surprised, emotionaly speaking, by the beauty and the strength of choregraphy and music. I Never went to New York,  but always remember the savage beauty of NY suburbs, through the Jets and  Sharks struggle and competition. 2 big moments: the gorgeous imitation of  sergeant Krupke by the Jets, and the emotional and vibrant garage  choregraphy after the 'struggle'. Thanks to R.Wise and L.Bertsein for their  emotion.
B00000DLV1|4.0|I agree with previous reviewers who say that this album has more presence than the studio recordings. Esp &quot;Sour Times&quot;, which sounds much more authentic here (rather top-40 on the studio album). Too bad one of my  favorites from Dummy, &quot;Roads&quot; is spoiled by the audience clapping  in time, as if this song were a country and western tune
0792151712|5.0|I love this movie.Not only is it surprisingly accurate, but I found the interaction between characters to be very moving.Cameron spared no expense on the making of this movie and I believe it shows.Also, the beginning of  the movie really brings you back to the actual time of the Titanic.I'm not  a big &quot;Leo fan&quot;, though I am a teenager,but I have to say that  the acting is great.However, the storyline is the movie's best asset.The  movie is an excellent tribute to the people who were on the actual ship.It  is a glimpse through the eyes of a seventeen year old girl of what happened  on April 14, 1912 to so many people.I can't say enough about this movie.
6303327982|5.0|In my opinion, this masterpiece is Oliver Stone's absolute best piece of work over even the great &quot;Platoon.&quot; It is filmed beautifully and Woody Harrleson, Juliet Levis, Tommy Lee Jones, Robert Downey Jr., and Tom  Siezmore all turn in riveting and darkly funny performances. This is a must  see for fans of gritty, controversial works. I will even go as far to say  that this is the most controversial movie of all time. A masterpiece with a  message. Superb!
B00000J7RZ|4.0|I support Jennifer 100%. She's a wonderful actress and dancer she has very decent lyrics. Many singers dress extremely trashy. Miss Lopez knew she didn't have to do that  to prove her decency.I admire her for that. Her  voice could use a little work but it had a lot of feeling . She did a  wonderful job for her first album.
B00000JG41|5.0|Mr. Bungle has created something rare and wonderful with this album.  Still leaves that Bungle taste in your mouth but they've gone off in a more melodic direction.  Patton's lyrics are poetic and haunting and his amazing  vocal chords ring out like butter and handgrenades.  Dunn, Spruance,  Heifetz, and McKinnon back him up with some truly brilliant melodies.  Fans  of Bungle or not, buy this album!  You won't regret it.
0375707972|4.0|I thought The Reader was a wonderful book with characters that could be easily identified with.  My only qualms with the book were that it did tend to be a little slow at times and occassionally a bit hard to believe.  I  think that everyone who has read and enjoyed Camus' The Stranger should  read The Reader as well.  It was beautiful in its tragedy and heartbreak  and yet not the least bit preachy or overdone.  Simplicity worked well for  The Reader.

6304145438|5.0|I've never felt so warm watching a movie as when I saw this classic for the first time. When the young Mary whispers into George's deaf ear, I'm hooked.<br /> What amazes me is that this movie seemed to gather mothballs for  30 years before becoming a phenomenon in the 1970s. I don't remember it  being shown even during Christmas in the 1960s, and I had never even heard  of it until Jimmy Stewart was on the Tonight Show, and Johnny Carson  remarked what a great film it was. I saw it at a  midnight movie in college  a short time later, and I couldn't believe how perfect it was. A year or  two later, it was on PBS a billion times each holiday, and it seemed like  everyone fell in love with it then. I can't blame 'em.
630450053X|4.0|When I first heard of Brandon Lee's death, I shivered. Father and son both cut down in their physical primes. Then when I heard that his final movie, &quot;The Crow&quot;, was being released without him, I had flashbacks of  &quot;Game of Death&quot;, the horrible &quot;final&quot; movie that was  released after Bruce Lee's untimely death in 1973. But when I went to see  this movie, I must say I was impressed. The movie itself was beautifully  directed,and the acting was above average. But Brandon stands out as Eric  Draven,and you can see the vast amount of talent in this young man. I only  wonder if that reservoir would have been tapped even further had he lived.  this movie was a fitting tribute to Brandon, although seeing him at the  brink of superstardom onscreen and knowing that it will never be achieved  is a bit depressing
0767805712|2.0|I must say I wasnt too optimistic when I rented this movie, but i didnt expect it to be this bad. The production desing is good and the actors are allright, but the script is pretty horrible. For instance, whats that that  those guys do in that room tapping computers keyboards ramdomly while  watching a pre-rendered 3D animation of a space flight? And how is that  were able to flight really far away in space and have machines that can  read the whole ADN map in seconds and were still unable to cure a broken  back? I could go on the 1000 words limit of this review telling all the  easily spotting fails of the really weak script but I dont want to spoil  the movie to those who hasnt seen it. Its an OK movie to hire on a boring  Sunday afternoon or to watch it on cable, but believe me, if youre  intelligent enough to notice that Episode I has quite a flop script youll  regret buying this. P.S: The only really good thing is the las of the  deleted scenes
B00000J7RZ|4.0|I've read other reviews posted on this album, and since the majority I've seen are negative, I'm surprised the album got a 4 1/2 star rating!  I enjoy Latin Music and while Jennifer may not be the most talented Latino  singer today, the effort is decent.  &quot;Let's Get Loud&quot; is the next  Latin hit, followed by &quot;No Me Ames&quot;.<br />From the perspective of a  ballroom dancer who is trying to get more popular music used for ballroom  dances, this album provides great Cha-Cha, Salsa and Hustle.<br />And,  considering all of the one hit wonders who come out of the woodwork with no  talent whatsoever, why not give Jennifer a chance?
6300214826|5.0|This is one of my ten favorite movies of all time. To be in this catagory a movie has to transform my world-view. I was drained for several days after seeing this movie. The non-stop juxtapositions of the vulgar and the  sublime are simply overwheming. <br />As the movie opens the screen is filled  with horizonal bands of lush subtle colors: azure sky, verdant jungle,  beige sand, and emerald sea as the opening notes of the Doors &quot;The  End&quot; tinkle in. When Jim Morrison sings, &quot;The is the end...&quot;  the treeline erupts in lurid napalm beauty. This is just the first of an  almost non-stop barrage of images that pervade this masterpiece.
6305603847|5.0|An unbelievable adventure.... A video that you will see something new every time you watch it... if you are a Pink Floyn fan then buy this NOW before it goes out of print like the VHS Tape did at one time.....

B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby is a great tool in the transition of mankind. He is one of many present day philosophers who are slowly gaining momentum in morphing the branded mindsets of us all. This album further exploits this momentum by  making an album that has multiple songs that are the Chronic for people of  any age and background. And to anybody who says they don't like this music,  that's cool, but I say it's time to stop saying what we dislike and start  makin the things we have learned to like a lot better.<br />P.s. If you have  no idea why I consider Moby a present day philosopher, then you should buy  one of his albums. He writes a huge hypothesis on life in every cd he  brings out.

0812931017|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The story of Richard's life is full of excitement and drama.  As I read and learned of the persistence and dedication to his companies I was truly inspired.  I highly recommend this  book to anyone who is interested in business leaders biographies.
B00000AFWW|5.0|This Hole album is amazing.I hope they consider &quot;Northern Star&quot; as a single.From &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; to &quot;Petals&quot; this is filled with great songs that make me feel great inside.Like I said though  &quot;Northern Star&quot; is the best song off this album and is perfect.It  is my favorite song ever.I didn't know what to expect from this album but  the &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; and &quot;Malibu&quot; singles made me get  it and I'm soooo glad I did.I listen to different types of music mostly  rap,some metal,some rock,and some adult contemperary but this is my  favorite album.I also have a huge crush on Missy.

078062369X|1.0|This movie wasn't as good as everyone says it is. The action was phony, Snipes did a bad acting job, and there was more gore than I expected. I also found it hard to believe that a man could walk down the street in  broad daylight with the handle of a sword sticking out the back of his coat  without anyone noticing it.
0688158234|5.0|From the first page I was virtually unable to put this book down;  after the last page it's images haunted me.  Beautifully written - an absolute must read for all women! Waris Dirie is as strong as she is beautiful and  this book is sure to help mobilize more people to join the fight to  eradicate female genital mutilation.
0374172897|2.0|I expected more brilliance from a Pulitzer prize winner. Although I found the structure of the novel well-crafted, little else impressed me: the prose was flat, totally without poetry or lyricism, and the characters, shallow. They needed to possess \\"humanity, humour, depth,\\" as Woolf suggests in the diary entry quoted in novel's prelude. She says that structure alone isn't enough. Since he included that quote in his book, Cunningham, surely, understood that, too. He just couldn't pull it off. For its structure alone, I would recommend it to most readers; however, I can't believe it won the Pulitzer prize.<br /> It's not that good.
0375707972|4.0|Schlink succeeded in representing an average man's struggle to find love, and the unaverage man's resulting eternal misfortune.  Mike Berg fell in love with Hanna Schmitz for obvious reasons at an extreme early age in his  life:  she pampered him like a helpless child and introduced him to  physical love.  However, when trying to capture love's essences apart from  the physical, Mike soon learned that he was doomed to fail.  Hanna, an  overly insecure woman who focused only on her well being, became as  ruthless as ever through verbal and physical abuse.  As Hanna had  undoubtedly been overly neglected in something as a child, her resulting  actions only hurt her.  Hanna had been ultimately charged with a crime  committed as a guard in Nazi Germany that sent her to prison.  One reading  this novel may easily be persuaded, as Mike eventually seemed to be, that  her evil actions became justified because of her insecurities.  What one  must keep in mind is that a lover would do anything to protect himself in a  relationship, and believing her actions to be justified is a typical thing  men do to reduce their own cognitive dissonance.  If we believe Hanna's  actions to be justified, we are looking at it subjectively, as Mike, or the  author.  Understanding Hanna as a self-centered sadist, I believe is the  correct way to look at her because there are certainly some essential  rights and wrongs in this world that there are no exceptions for.  Hanna  violated them, and coerced a man to obsess over her through excessive  physical attention, mental neglect, abuse and abandonment.
0790729989|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Morgan Freeman is amazing in this film.  Kevin Spacey as always put out a great performance as John Doe.  This movies has you thinking until the last minute just like  Fallen, then it hits you like a train.  This is also one of the most  violent movies I have ever seen but that only tells the story more indepth.   I suggest getting it for everyone or at least renting it for a weekend.
0767802470|5.0|This is the WW2 film I comapare all other WW2 films with. There is nothing more to say, BRILLIANT! Maybe Hollywood with all its expertise can make some mor movies like this. I enjoyed saving private ryan, but all the  sentimentality and the fake tanks, and bogus tactics just destroys  everything. Do like Das Boot, be authentic, and bring in some real  &quot;people&quot;

0385493800|4.0|The Testement is a good book that i would highly recomend for adults.(Im a kid but that's okay). It is an exiting book and while it is not john grisham at his best(The Chamber is) it is a great book.  I give it 4 stars.
0671578278|5.0|When I found this book had been released I rushed out and bought it. It took me a total of 9 hours to read, including stops to eat. I cannot stress enough that this book is now at the top of my all time favourites, beating  out David Weber. The only bad point is that my wife has just sat down with  it.
B000002UWF|5.0|I first heard the album in 4 th of July -99 at a garden party in the South of Sweden, Europe, where I happen to live. The party was thrown by my cousin and her american husband. As soon as I heard the music I just went  wild and couldnt help dancing around although I was sober as a muslim on  Ramadan whereas some of the other guests must have thought I was either  crazy or on drugs (which I was not). I have since bought the album via  internet and I think I know why Prima didnt reach fame in Europe - he was  apparently scared to fly according to the album booklet.  Finally, I  consider this the best cd Ive listened to for a long, long time!
0788811355|5.0|This is what I call a &quot;wavelength movie.&quot;  Like last year's &quot;The Thin Red Line,&quot; either you are on its wavelength, or you are not. I happened to be--I was deeply affected by its story, which has themes  that encompass madness, violent passion, loyalty and the meaning of  ownership.  The film is labrynthine, powerfully sexual, and sometimes  startlingly violent.  Those walking in for &quot;Lawrence of Arabia Pt.  II&quot; will be disappointed.  Those who thought &quot;Fargo&quot; was a  better film may be right, but to be honest, the two are like apples and  oranges--like comparing ancient Arabian chants with rock 'n' roll.  I give  this film five stars because few are bold enough to wear ambition on their  sleves like this film (&quot;Titanic&quot; is the only film I can think of  that compares in this way), and even fewer realize that ambition so fully  (which &quot;Titanic&quot;, sadly, did not).
1573226521|5.0|&quot;The Beach&quot; is the best book I have and will ever read. You can't help but really like Richard. I wish there was a sequel! The descriptions of the luscious beach made my mouth water. I couldn't put it  down. Alex Garland deserves a Pulitzer for this work. I will never forget  it.
0425152251|4.0|I had to read this book for my 10th grade AP European class.  Overall, I thought it was pretty (some parts were rather interesting), but things need fixing.  Personally, I didn't like the fact that it became a book inside a  book (fellow readers, you know what I mean).  I wish Sophie and Alberto  continued to exist in reality, like the rest of us.  The Disney figures  along with the fairy tale figures were pretty lame too.  But as I said, an  overall good book.
0790739356|1.0|I'm sorry but I feel the need to protect the general public from this movie.  Bad story, Bad acting, Bad action.  Just bad.  Don't waste your time.
B00000255F|5.0|Most 17 year-olds should probably be listening to Kid Rock, or Limp Bizkit or something, but with a song as great as this, it's not easy.  From the opening drums and driving guitar, all the way to the 'whoaaaaaa's at the  end, &quot;Born to Run&quot; even today shows why it's the greatest song  ever.  Every night after work at 2 a.m., I drive home with the windows down  and blast this song as loud as it'll go.  I've been doing this every night  for about over a year now, and I haven't even begun to grow sick of it.  Other songs may have better guitar solos or a more wild beat but  Springsteen demonstrates all of the subtleties involved to make a song  perfect. And that's exactly what he has-a flawless masterpiece. Oh yeah,  'Thunder Road' ain't bad either. Rock on, Bruce.  Adam J
6300214435|5.0|With non-stop ridiculous action sequences, funny acting, and interesting humor, this movie doesn't know when to quit.
6303617719|5.0|Oh course Meg Ryan is just bouncy and funny.  But I was most impressed with Kevin Kline.  Having been to France numerous times his accent and attitudes hit the spot.  So many aspects of the French culture (not just  the stereotypical rudeness) are done so well.  Giggled the whole time!
0790737973|3.0|This was a rare movie that was exactly like the book, story wise. But for some reason, the movie misses the suspense and thrills of the book despite the good actors (and Sharon Stone, heh, heh).
0671015206|3.0|This book should be entitled &quot;Learning How to Be Cheap&quot;, or alternatively, &quot;Wait Until You're Seventy-Five Before Living Your Life&quot;, or even &quot;Penny-Pinching For Life!&quot;. I was very  disaapointed with this book. The authors do not tell the readers anything  new, nor have they created a formula for building wealth.  Simply stated,  they have MERELY PUBLISHED RESULTS OF A SURVEY, in which the response rate  was 45%.  In addition, only 34.5% (or 385 out of a total 1115 respondents)  had a net worth in excess of $1M. (see Appendix 1 of the book).
B00000J7J4|5.0|I bought this CD just for one song, but now I can't decide which is my favorite.  Carlos, you are the man!  And getting together with Eric Clapton was just too much to handle.  I thoroughly recommend this CD to everyone.
0767818040|5.0|This early Brian De Palma seems to have held up well over the years.  It did receive some bum raps when it came out;e.g., too obviously patterned after Hitchcock, but I think it is a credit to him.<br />Graig Wesson's career  never went far, and that's too bad.<br />The musical score is excellent, and  of course, the camera technique is patented De Palma.  Also typical,  you  can fit most of the dialogue in many long portions on a page or two.
068484267X|5.0|This book is a testimony of human survivability under the most horrid impoverished situations. It shows what the God given soul can overcome. I loved this book and am awaiting the release of &quot;tis&quot;
0312199066|5.0|I know the author personally and have flown right seat with him in his Cessna 421.  Reading this book is like standing on the ramp at our local airport talking to him.  (He visits about once a year.)<br />Gene is  all-american and down to earth (no pun intended).  You feel like you've  known him all your life either in talking to him in person or by reading  his book.  It took less than 3 days because it reads so fluidly.  My wife  Barb read it in it's entirety and felt the same.<br />I recommend this book  wholeheartedly to anyone young, old or in between because you are getting a  superb insight into the real world of our astronauts.
0783226160|5.0|This movie is a classic. Don't see any other party-animal movies till you've seen this one(Senior trip, Can't hardly wait, Half baked, Mall Rats, etc...)Not only is it really REALLY funny, but it actually has a good  story, amazing!
B00000IAU3|5.0|Every once in awhile I find a CD that I immediately feel I need to send to everybody I know.

You will love it...or...if not, just send it to me...
B00000JPHD|5.0|No one can ever come close to Lugosi's performace as Dracula. It has to be the best of the Vampire movies. And not just Lugosi,but they all do fantastic. If any Horror Movie is good it is Dracula.
B000003B6J|5.0|Easily one of the most important rap recordings ever, &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; best exemplifies the frustration of young black men in inner city LA.  All were legit, especially Eazy, who served time in prison.  Buy  it.

0553212478|3.0|Mary Shelley had an excellent idea when she wrote this book, however, she had a poor execution of it. This book is uneven, boring, wordy, and Mary Shelley is unable to express simple emotions like sorrow and pain in words.  While this novel is generally thought-provoking, it could have been much,  much better. Although it may have been a breakthrough at the time, today it  simply fades into the background.
B00000I924|5.0|After absorbing this startling, spectacular comeback from the always-fascinating Beck, I had the good fortune to hear him live--in an open-air amphitheater in the pouring rain, no less, with Jonny Lang as the  opening act. Now the concert, this record, and portions of those that  proceeded it (most notably &quot;Blow by Blow&quot; and  &quot;Wired&quot;)have all run together in my head to form a big Jeff Beck  soup. Even after more than three decades of playing, there's still no one  else who can touch him. Take away the techno trappings, and this is just  the Jeff Beck guitar lovers have been adoring for years.
B000001FSU|2.0|Some people think this Anthrax at thier peak,or think this is thier best album. I think STATE OF EUPHORIA is rather weak. Some songs are decent,but thats it,decent not great. Their next one PERSISTENCE OF TIME is much  better.Get that one instead,and avoid STATE OF EUPHORIA.
B000001BX0|5.0|Aside from Mana, MOLOTOV is the best thing (musically speaking) that has come out of Mexico in a long time.  So if you are sick of listening to the bubble gum pop of Lucero and la Onda Vaselina, this CD is the only way to  go.  You've got to love what these guys have to say about our country, you  can't deny the truth and these guys know it.  The next's generation's TRI.  And if you only listen to one track Puto is the one!
0375701427|5.0|This book approachs a major question about relationships that happens to be framed in post-war suburban New Jersey.  Having grown up in that area during that time improves my understanding and appreciation of the depth of  understanding Roth illustrates.  What is it that makes a child abhor the  seemingly perfect life of her parents and their values?  Why are the  child's values, undoubtedly taught by the parents at some level, violently  opposed to those of her teacher parents?  Why couldn't Swede take a stand  about anything?  These are transcendent questions that give power and  emotion to this work.  If you want a standard crafted plot, watch TV; if  you want to think, try this book.
031286504X|4.0|I started this and could not put it down...I had to know what happened in the end. Matheson is one hell of an author. I got into the main characters head and felt the isolation and frustration he felt. I only was  disappointed when it was over. I wanted to keep up the wild  ride...EXCELLENT.

B00000JPH4|5.0|I love this film. It is a piece of excellent film work by Jim Henson.  When I was a child I used to watch the film all the time.  Still now I enjoy the film.  I would recommend the film to anyone who enjoyed,  Labrynth, Goonies, The Wizard of OZ and Willywonka and the Chocolate  factory.
0671578278|5.0|If you've ever read the Aubrey/Maturin series by Patrick O'Brien, you'll understand when I say that Civil Campaign is like the second volume of that series. When O'Brien did Jane Austen, it worked. When Bujold does Jane  Austen, it's hilarious. Good all 'round.
B000002C25|4.0|OK, maybe 4-1/2.  My taste in rock music is truly flawless.  I really think this album is beneath my usual high standards.  Problem is, it's so damn good I can't stop listening to it.
B000002I77|5.0|my husband says this is a great album, and he never says anything nice about nothin'. A real energizer for the psyche, soul and bod.
B000002C1Z|5.0|I am so crazy over this album. I just got it yesterday, and I've listened to it like 5 times already. The state that I'm in now, I'm not one to say which album is better than which, but on this I must spill it. To me, this  album beats Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, and The Wall by  longshots. I can listen to this alot easier than the previous 3, not that I  don't enjoy them, those albums are just overplayed. &quot;Pigs On The Wing  part 1&quot;, is a beautiful acoustic opener. &quot;Dogs&quot;, just does  something so big to me that I can't even describe it. This song is a hell  of alot better than &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot;. The guitar work  is so brilliant and so are the vocals. This is the best song on the album.  This song could play for days in a row and I would not get tired of it.  I'ts so damn beautiful, and haunting. &quot;Pigs (Three different  ones)&quot;, another brilliant track with good vocals, guitar work and a  nice beat. &quot;Sheep&quot;, is also very good. It has some sci-fi stuff  on it, if you listen carefully. I just love the guitar at the last minute  or two of the song. &quot;Pigs On The Wing part 2&quot;, is a great  closing, similar to part 1, but different lyrics.<br />I can't praise this  album high enough, i'ts just so excellent, and like I mentioned above , a  hell of alot better than &quot;Floyd's&quot; 3 most overplayed albums.  Those 3 albums are definitely not the best out of their catalog.<br />P.S.,  don't let the album title and the song titles fool you, because there is  alot of hidden musical substance behind it all. <br />Just a few weeks ago, I  said that getting this album is a waste of time, so why bother?<br />Boy, am I  glad I changed my mind, because now I just can't put the album down.<br />5  stars all the way,<br />Thanks,<br />4.12.20, 4/18.
6304025831|5.0|Casino is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Non stop action, and a good story.  De Niro, Pesci, and Stone make this movie an absoulte hit.  What makes it even better is the fact that the movie is 100%  true!
0451191153|3.0|I'm a libertarian and an avid reader, so a counselor at my high school suggested I might enjoy this and lent me a copy.  I enjoyed reading the book, but was ultimately somewhat unsatisfied at the end.  The plot was  interesting and kept me reading, but I found the characters to be very  shallow and uninteresting, and I found it difficult to sympathize with The  protagonist Howard.  At first I was rooting for him, but when he  experienced one defeat after another and didn't seem to care, I stopped  caring, too.  I actually found the villians more interesting than the hero,  for the most part.  Peter was interesting, and it was interesting to read  about his rise and what he did to achieve it.  Toohey was interesting at  first, but after his big speech to Peter he descended into cartoonish  supervillainy.  The only character I really liked was the sculptor, who was  admirable but, unlike Howard, actually seemed human.  I realize that Rand  was trying to create a portrait of her ideal man with Howard, rather than a  realistic person, and that this ideal man would probably require equally  unrealistic supporting characters and enemies, but I felt the characters  were so unrealilistic as to be mostly uninteresting. Still, overall I  enjoyed the book and would reccomend it.  Just don't expect it to be as  earthshattering as the positive reviews say.
6305078564|5.0|I bought the DVD since I had worn out the videos I taped during the A&amp;E presentation.  I had no idea I was missing a good hour of dialogue!  Lead-ins, fade-outs, entire scenes shown in the DVD were missing from the  original presentation.  It was great to hear dialogue which explained some  non-sequitors in the original.

B00000INEX|3.0|Our 6 month old (very fussy) son absolutely adores Baby Mozart, and we were so relieved to have found something that calmed him down 100% of the time that we bought Baby Bach and Baby Einstein. <br />I heartily agree with  those who say that Baby Bach is a big step down from Baby Mozart--the  &quot;timing&quot; (balance of images/music intervals) isn't as good, the  toys aren't as interesting to watch and the toys are not as well matched to  the music. Furthermore, the &quot;jazzed up&quot; arrangements of the Bach  music didn't strike me as very appealing to babies, and (like other  reviewers) my baby and I get totally bored by the images of the creators'  kids telling jokes, jumping around, and generally hamming it up for the  camera. It seemed to me as if they ran out of ideas, so they decided to  just film their kids for a while and edit those segments in.<br />Though I'm a  big Bach fan myself, I think the tiniest tykes might not find his music as  engaging as Mozart's (at least not the selections they chose), and that may  be another problem with this video.<br />That said, we are afraid that someday  soon our little one will get tired of Baby Mozart, so Baby Bach will do for  variety. I'm not sorry we bought it, but I hope that the video's producers  will wait until they have enough new and good ideas before producing  another video, rather than slapping together a production like Baby Bach.
B00000J7J4|5.0|I have always had great respect for the talents  and genius of Santana, though I have never been a big fan, nor have I ever purchased any of his music until now.  When I heard &quot;Smooth&quot; on the  radio I instantly  loved it and knew I had to have this album.  The collaborations with Rob  Thomas (whom in my opinion is an excellent songwriter), Everlast, Lauren  Hill, and Dave Mathews  are  outstanding (and Clapton).  This album  introduces a whole new audience to Santana.  His talent is<br />tireless and  his music seems to be consistently enthralling.  He is one of those  artists, who you don't need to be a fan, nor know the names of his songs to  know his sound, if that makes sense. Buy this album!  You wont regret it.
006107327X|5.0|Forget your Picassos, Van Goughs and Warhols; as this book shows so beautifully, Bruce Timm is THE artist of the century!!! Every page is absolutely packed with the most gorgeous piccies this side of the Cistine  Chapel!!! Breathless hyperbole aside, this is a really stunning book, with  plenty of interesting behind- the- scenes info and unseen sketches which  make it a must for any animation student or Batfan. Looking at the early  character designs next to shots from the latest series show just how far  this show has evolved. Well worth your money.<br />Now if only an Aussie  network would screen the last series... and SUPERMAN... and BATMAN  BEYOND...
B00000I0XW|4.0|Sarah has a voice of an angel!  I was never an ALW fan, nor did I know who Brightman was, until  I accidentally came across a television special  celebrating ALW .  When I heard Sarah sing I just had to hear more.  Some  of the songs are new to me and she makes me want to listen to them.  I   really enjoy her version of &quot;Don't Cry For Me&quot; and &quot;All I  Ask of You&quot;.
0140131558|5.0|This trilogy of novels, or two novellas and a short story, as it should rightly be called, should be made essential reading for 1. Anyone travelling to New York in the near future, and 2. Anyone who would like to  feel free of the realist grip that most literary fiction has been in, with  some periods of upheaval, for far too long now. Auster makes the term  'post-modern' reader-friendly; after all, what is wrong with the author  referring to himself as a fictitious character within his or her own work  (even when he goes as far as introducing you to his home and meeting his  wife)? This Auster does on various occasions in these loosely linked pseudo  detective fictions, cramming in themes and obsessions such as the impulse  to tell stories (within stories) and to get away from modern life,  Hamsun-like, to go back to the roots of nature and language. But it's not  done in any way that could be called pretentious. Auster is not interested  in describing human features or writing two paragraphs (or six) on how a  room looks; he is more interested in drawing parallels and trying to fix  why something is where it is. Identity is his main concern, and within the  parabola of his narrow range of reference points (Paris, the native  American legacy, working on ships, New York, coincidences) he twists and  turns with it as dexterously as Borges. Suffice to say that the three  stories involve coincidence and searches passim. The initial story, City of  Glass, about a writer who becomes a detective on an infuriating mission to  find a man for a woman after a misdialled telephone call, appears again in  the other stories both as himself and as a reflection of other characters  engaged in looking for other mysterious characters. The point of the middle  story, Ghosts, only becomes clear when you get to the end of the last, The  Locked Room, by which  time you have to go back and read the whole thing  again (with pleasure). In the meantime you've been taken on the kind of  existential, mythical journey that dignifies detective fiction well beyond  its seeming limitations. It's fascinating to read how Auster has  consistently used his real-life experiences (not all that exceptional on  the face of it), to create such compulsive fiction, and you can get a lot  of this from his autobiography, Hand To Mouth. It was inevitable that he  would move into film-making one day, and his Lulu On The Bridge, has not  disappointed (Smoke and Blue in The Face were worthy apprenticeships which  he mainly scripted and had some directorial involvment in).Probably even  better than NYT are Moon Palace and Leviathan.
0792838084|5.0|blue velvet is a cinematic masterpiece almost without peer.  david lynch has taken a small safe town from americas suburbs and has turned it into a festering hole for evil and all of its henchman.  he explores the duality  of man and woman using some of the most perfectly portrayed characters ever  created.  david lynch dares the viewer to hang in there and think for  themselves.  besides all of the above mentioned blue velvet has all of the  cream of the crop, much repeated, and criminally hard to forget lines ever  written.  these lines are also delivered by the best actors and actresses,  and for this blue velvet deserves to be seen over and over scene by scene  forever.

6302293553|5.0|It just doesn't get much better than this movie, folks.  I saw it at the theater in 1975, bought the video, bought the soundtrack.  If you're a Python fan, you'll love this; if not, you'll wonder what's wrong with the  rest of us.  &quot;Camelot&quot;, &quot;The Knights Who Say Ni&quot;,  &quot;The Trojan Rabbit&quot;, &quot;Bring Out Your Dead&quot;, surprise  ending... sound intriguing?  Then give this video a try and learn the  highly scientific way of determining if someone is a witch.
B000002MM8|1.0|This CD is truly insidious in that every once in a while there's a moment that almost makes you think that perhaps it's getting better. But it DOESN'T. It just keeps going. The pretentious and disjointed lyrics  delivered with hideously annoying voices keep going. The initially  interesting instrumentals that long overstay their welcome KEEP GOING until  you want to shove the CD down a Cuisinart, then burn the Cuisinart. I got  through half a listen on this one. And I may consider listening to it  again, if somebody were to tie me down by my wrists and ankles and then  duct tape my mouth to keep me from trying to drown the excrutiating noise  with my screams. On the other hand, I might gnaw off my own legs in order  to escape.

0393317552|5.0|If you read the reviews below, you'll have noticed that the reaction to this book was very polarized (I almost said &quot;black and white&quot;).  Many readers enjoyed it thoroughly and found it very stimulating.  A number  of readers, however, savaged it in a fairly emotional tone.  The readers  who panned the book fall into several groups, dominated by the ones who  just can't get past that off-hand comment in the introduction of the book  concerning the author's conviction that his hunter-gatherer friends in New  Guinea seem more intelligent on average than his friends of European  descent.  Lighten up.  All he was saying was that he had difficulty with  the thesis that agriculturally-based societies consistently trounce  hunter-gather societies because of genetically determined intellectual  superiority, given that hunter-gatherers have to live on their wits while  in the case of members of agricultural, animal-domesticating societies,  natural selection has operated more to favor immunity to the childhood  diseases peculiar to those societies.<br />So Diamond searched for another  explanation, and came up with one that's consistently interesting, though  obviously not foolproof:  Eurasian societies happened to have access to a  high-protein cereal (wheat) with a reproductive method amenable to quick  and easy tinkering by humans, which grew in an area with few geographical  barriers to east-west diffusion, thus avoiding the need for adaptation of  the crop to the shorter or longer days of other latitudes.  In the New  World, in contrast, the available grain (ancestral corn) had lower protein,  was more vulnerable to excessive hybridization by wild unimproved crops,  and faced barriers to transmission along the predominantly North-South axis  of the combined continents.  Why the emphasis on cereals, a product of  temperate climates, rather than the foods relied on by the original  proto-humans in Africa?  Cereal was critical because it was adapted to a  climatewith a severe dry season, which encouraged development of a plant  whose survival strategy was become an annual that concentrated its food  value in a rich seed that could survive a drought before resprouting,  rather than a perennial that invested in permanent structure, bark, etc.   This is the kind of food that permitted early humans to experiment with  gathering and storing excess food.  Why the emphasis on ease of diffusion?   Because the author believes that cultural and technological innovation  occur more quickly when large numbers of diverse, well-fed societies could  experiment independently and then communicate with one another.  You don't  have to buy any of this, but his evidence for each proposition (and the  many others in his book) certainly is worth a look.<br />Another category of  harsh critics points to the book's repetitiousness (a fair criticism) and  to the popular-science approach of summarizing the work of other scientists  in a Reader's Digest fashion.  This may be a fair criticism, too, but  unless you're terrifically well trained in a number of fields of science,  do you think it is likely to bother you?<br />Personally I'd have liked to  hear more of the author's views on how to explain the dominance of the  horse-mounted waves of Eurasian invaders.  Clearly this book works best  from the end of the last Ice Age through about 1 A.D., and for conflicts  among continents rather than within each continent.
6305127689|5.0|TOP GUN the way it was released almost 14 years ago left us speechless with its special effects video and sound but having the chance to experience the DVD version gives you the feeling that even top guns can be  taken to higher levels of performance.

6301966015|3.0|Mercurial London fashion photographer David Hemmings, out to shoot random scenes in a nearby park, secretly follows a couple as they playfully stroll through several park backdrops. The woman notices him and tries to retrieve  the roll of film, apparently since she is there seeing a married man.  Hemmings declines to give up the roll, developing it later in his lab. As  he studies the scenes, he thinks he spies some suspicious shapes in the  bushes and finds that he has inadvertently filmed evidence of the murder of  the woman's boyfriend.  The breezy, moonlit scenes of the murder site are  haunting, and the mystery of just what happened there--and why--are what  stay with you. The 60's hip element is dated, but the film remains  effective and spooky in just the right way.
B000002MFN|1.0|This songwriting is pretty cheesy, plus Madonna can't sing. Bad songwriting and poor vocals equal lame album.
B000000W5P|3.0|I'd stopped listening to the Stones when &quot;Some Girls&quot; was released in 1978.  This grungy, muddy, slap-dash record didn't inspire me to continue, and for a few months I rarely played it.  Eventually it grew  on me; with the exception of &quot;Lies&quot; which is a complete waste of  time, these tracks have all aged well.  However, almost all of them sound  much better in live performance, if you can get your hands on one of the  better bootlegs.  There is at least a full verse of &quot;When the Whip  Comes Down&quot; that wasn't included on this album; also the mix is so  sloppy here that you can't really appreciate Bill Wyman's bass line, which  is what makes this song really kick.  (Naturally, even the Stones didn't  dare peform the title track in concert.)  <br />This record was mostly  produced by Jagger, and it shows.  Grungy sound is fine for the Ramones,  but the Stones ain't them.<br />Far from being the last great Stones record,  this is a poorly produced quasi-comeback that is eclipsed in quality by  superior works such as &quot;Undercover&quot;, &quot;Steel Wheels&quot;,  and &quot;Bridges to Babylon.&quot;  Even &quot;Black and Blue&quot; is a  better album overall.
B00000K19E|5.0|I walked into the theater expecting to see the run of the mill let down put forth by Keanu Reeves; however, when the plot unfolded in all of its high-tech complexity, the movie proved to be more than just a Reeves  spotlight.  Its action and fast-paced sequencing kept me interested through  the entire movie. Maybe Keanu will learn how to act one of these days.
B000002C1X|3.0|I bought &quot;The Wall&quot; when it was released in 1979.  I was disappointed in it then; I like it enough now to buy this remastered version, but it's still a mixed bag for me.  There are some strong tracks,  some filler, and a lot of self-indulgence.  Do we really need to hear that  idiot teacher shouting &quot;If you don't eat your meat...&quot; After  hearing that on the radio for the last 20 years, I wish it could be edited  out.  The lyrics to &quot;Mother&quot; are also annoying, and detract from  what could have been a great song.  I much prefer &quot;Wish You Were  Here&quot; and &quot;Dark Side of the Moon.&quot;  Still, the continuing  popularity of &quot;The Wall&quot; makes it impossible to dismiss it as  simply a failed concept album.  It's worth listening to for David Gilmour's  brilliant guitar work, if nothing more.
B0000031OR|5.0|Chick was on to something on this album... The first for him of this type carries you off instantly to a dreamscape filled with the percussive effect of chick's fender rhodes. A beautiful album for showing the versitility of  this relatively new instrument in jazz. I put chick alongside herbie  hancock in masters of the rhodes but in completely different style. A latin  flavor is evident throughout. Moreira and Clarke add brilliantly to this  theme, as they help support chick in his probings in improvisation. An easy  listen and a definate buy!
B000000W5F|3.0|Like &quot;Some Girls&quot;, &quot;Tattoo You&quot; was widely hailed by critics as &quot;their best since 'Exile on Main Street.'&quot;  I couldn't understand why.  In fact I was so disappointed in this album that I didn't  bother to see the Stones when they came to town.  Those of us who grew up  on the classic Stones were mystified as to why a throwaway song like  &quot;Start Me Up&quot; was so wildly popular.<br />Almost 20 years later, I  still don't care for &quot;Start Me Up&quot;, and &quot;Neighbors&quot;  gets my vote for worst Stones song ever.  &quot;Hang Fire&quot; and  &quot;Slave&quot; are fairly pointless.  &quot;Little T &amp; A&quot; is  funny (at least Keith isn't singing one of his ballads); and &quot;Black  Limousine&quot; is a tolerable blues.<br />The second side has improved  steadily over the years, and &quot;Waiting on a Friend&quot; is the one  true gem on this album.<br />Fortunately the Stones would FINALLY make another  great record --- in 1983 &quot;Undercover&quot; was released and the stale,  &quot;sucking in the 70s&quot; were behind them.  The great decline stopped  with &quot;Tattoo You.&quot;
6305470448|5.0|Truth be told, Shakespeare in Love is not nearly as substantial as its rich style would have you believe.  The romance between Will and Viola doesn't seem to be much about romance; they aren't soulmates, but they're  great bedmates.  You'd think our beloved William Shakespeare would be less  shallow!<BR><BR> On the other hand, Romeo and Juliet itself is a story more  about passion and lust than true, romantic love.  This parallel fuels the  moods and unpredictability of the entire film, as it does the brilliant  play-within-a-play structure.<BR><BR> And like a good Elizabethan era play,  you got all mixes of low-brow and high-brow for all audiences.  Great  costumes, witty dialogue, great plot twists, fight scenes, some brooding  drama, reverence for the Queen, reverence for the common man, and biting  irreverence for everybody else.  And plenty comedy.  Verbal comedy.   Physical comedy.  Situational comedy.<BR><BR> Add up all these things and  it's very hard not to swoon.  The winner here is the screenwriters who have  succeeded in playing homage to the Elizabethan literature while playing it  (and our time) for laughs by making a play that might have belonged in it.   Couple it with a classic Hollywood production (itself a continuation of  that era's penchant for maximal thrills), and you have Shakespeare In Love,  the best romantic comedy I've ever seen.
B00000490M|5.0|Great movie with great mix of comedy,action,drama and good martial arts.One of the best scenes was when Mr Myagi beat up all five of the cobras, although in real life he didn't know squat about karate. I don't  think Ralph Macchio did either for that matter,but regardless it was still  a great movie.
0195067142|5.0|I read this book while a student attending the Army War College.  As a military historian and US Army officer, I feel more than qualified to say this is the best book written by a soldier I've ever read.  I could not put  it down.  The author has captured the horror of war, hell - he lived thru  it.  If you want a sense for the terror of war in the Pacific during WW II,  buy Sledge's book.

6305291489|5.0|I rented The Parent Trap, thinking it's another one of the ordinary family comedies we see every day on TV... But it turned out to be exactly the opposite! I watched it once, and then I couldn't believe I wanted to see it  again, and then again (I now plan to buy it for good!). I have not seen the  1961 original Parent Trap, but in any case, this one is admirably great! It  grasps you from the first (or second maybe) moment, and it gets you eager  and eager to see what happens next, while it entertains you with nice  little jokes between the girls and... you'll see! Don't be afraid to let a  tear off your eye, from time to time. The plotline and the scenes are so  well-made, that you may even get goose bumps the same time the actors do!  Just get it and watchit all together! You'll be thrilled and have great fun  (if you're a child), or you'll be moved and have an equally great time (if  you're not a child any more)...! I personally loved it... all 5 times I  watched it!
0887307396|5.0|Collins and Porras did their homework. This was a great book, well organized, and they resisted most of the temptations to write as academics. This book's value will last into the Knowledge Age.
0792156684|2.0|The film is obviously great and the image on DVD is excellent. But man, this is probably the poorest DVD I've ever purchased. No featurette, no commentary tracks, no production notes, no cast bios, no special effects  documentaries, wide screen format only. Very dissapointing. It's just a  barebones DVD. I'll be very annoyed if they come out with a full featured  edition in the future.

006109594X|1.0|The reviews that compare Mr. Robinson to Tom Clancy are off the mark.  Robinson's characters are omnipotent, superhuman, and completely unbelievable.  They belong in romance novels, not a military  techno-thriller that is billed as &quot;the new standard&quot; in this  genre. The level of technical detail is woeful, and where it is present, it  doesn't leave the reader believing or trusting it fully.  Clancy is a  master, this guy is trying to cash in on his coat-tails with a shoddy  product.  I wish I hadn't wasted my money.
B000000WI6|4.0|Right after I played this for the first time, the fire alarm in our building went off. I think it was just coincidence, but it was appropriate, because Johnny smokes through the entire CD.<br />It took a couple listens  before I got used to his singing, which seems smoother than on his other  CDs. I like the more tortured way he sings.<br />Standout cuts:  Illustrated  Man, title cut, any of the four with Dr. John on piano. Johnny Winter fans  won't be disappointed.
B00000I8UD|2.0|On the surface this disc might appear to be sylvian's masterpiece.  I have read recent reviews that make this claim.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Several songs alphabet angel, god man, krishna blue, cafe  europa, are just plain duds.  The good songs pollen path , dobro #2 and  thalhiem can't make up for the blandness that surrounds them.  Also, I  don't want to hear sylvian imitate tom waits and sade in the same song  (Midnight Sun)or miles davis in another (all my mothers's names).   Brilliant trees, Gone to Earth and the Rain Tree Crow Disc are all  masterworks from an unusually gifted man.  Dead Bee's is just plain dull.   Maybe he has choosen the wrong guitarists.  Could fripp have saved this   lackluster event?  Maybe it just took too long to make. Better luck next  time. But will we have to wait till 2010? A huge D.S. Fan
630512065X|1.0|Memory &amp; Mr Mistoffelees and the magic of Elaine Paige and Sir John Mills were all that kept the ALW HIT? HIT? HIT? from being a total loss. At the end of the film I was as un-enlightened as at the beginning. If there  is a PREMISE behind this show it completely escaped me. Was the plot left  in the litter box? In my opinion, this production is a sham and a  shame........
B0000013GT|5.0|This album is just as fresh in 1999 as it was in 1996. The funky production this time was cooked for the most part by Andre and Big Boi in their danked out home lab and the result is out of this world cosmic flows  and the most beautiful African sounds to come from the soil of Confederate  Georgia.

0671004107|1.0|Carl Sagan has done a good job of popularizing a sciences such as astronomy and physics and making them accessible to non-scientists like myself.  The plot in the book is sort of cool but it just seem overly  simplistic.<br />Also, the characters were AWFUL. Just devices to carry the  plot. I found myself not caring about a single one of them. Some of them  were downright ridiculous. I'm glad that generally, Sagan stuck to  non-ficton.<br />There's better stuff out there.
B00000IQMT|5.0|John Williams score for this STAR WARS new episode is simply the most strong evidence that good movie music lasts forever. I myself am a collector of soundtracks and scores for some years, and it was hard for me  not to be hugely impressed by this new John Williams work. DUEL OF THE  FATES and THE DROID BATTLE are amazing!!! I just couldnt help playing this  cd over and over again. The music took me almost inside the action !!!  Anyway, watching one movie without a nice score on the bottom is not to  enjoy movies at all. What else to say? Five stars deserved!! Yes, sir, its  a collectors essential item. Just impossible to miss it.
0375707972|2.0|I was instantly intrigued by a summary I read in the paper of this book.  I finally purchased it and immediately began reading.  It was slow at first and I only kept reading b/c I thought it would pick up - but it didn't.   There really was no climax and the ending was depressing.  I gave it 2  stars because it was a great plot, but it did not live up to my  expectations.
B0000029AP|5.0|sweet emotion is the best song they've ever don
0606002006|4.0|Of Mice and Men was one of the best books i have ever read. It is definetly one of more readable classics. It is a great book about friendship, responsibilty, and love.
068484267X|4.0|I loved McCourt's book, it's amazing how he can remember everything in such great detail. He certainly has a gift for writing and I look forward to reading the sequel, his life in America. I'd like to talk about the book  with anyone, email me if you want.
B000002KNI|5.0|I'm not going to gush that it's the best CD ever made, but it's certainly worth your $.  There are a *ton* of great songs on here, and they're so funky--much more so than studio recordings!  If you're finicky for polished  performances and surround sound, you might get frustrated, but I'm pretty  fussy when it comes to that and I still enjoy these performances immensely.   This album is about as good as it gets with Simon and Garfunkel.<br />Plus,  there are very few songs you're going to want to skip over, so you're not  going to find yourself with 8 minutes of music after you get to the good  stuff.  Even if you own every album/compilation and have every song, you'll  want to hear the 'revved up' live versions.  This is a great CD to bring on  roadtrips--I drove from western CT to Rhode Island playing just this CD,  and my friend and I had a blast. When you close your eyes, it's like you're  there!
B00000K2SE|5.0|If you are reading this waiting breathelessly for the release of this movie in November then you have already seen it two or more times.  There is nothing that I can say that will make you want this movie more.  I am  not a Reeves fan, but his chemisty with Fishburne and Moss is remarkable.   The selling point though will be the special effects, for which I initially  saw the movie.  The sheer concept though is revolutionary.  Perhaps there  never has been nor will be another,that will make you question the very air  you breath
B0000024UX|3.0|This CD's worth it--I found there were few songs I couldn't stand.  However, I found there were few songs I fell in love with, either, besides the perennially popular (and included in most albums) The Boxer, El Condor  Pasa, and Cecelia.  Some are pretty catchy, like So Long Frank Lloyd Wright  and The Only Living Boy in New York, but most songs have some very good  parts and some stale parts/verses.  It's a good album to have, because a  lot of the songs are unique to this album, and worth listening to.  But I'd  hardly consider this their masterpiece album.
B000002LKF|5.0|Without a doubt my all time favorite album. Not just my favorite Paul Simon album. This album is a complete crossover for the pop world . Paul Simon has created an experience with this collection of songs. His lyrics  are simple and to the point and make you wish that feelings you had could  be expressed so blunt and with such beauty. Lines such as &quot;wash you  tangled curls with gamblers soap&quot;, pervey a sense of grace that is  universal. The afro- cuban and latin percussion is stunning.I bought this  album five years ago and still listen to it almost every day..Just buy  it..If I took the time to write this it is well worth the time listening to  it.
B0000024YL|3.0|I like this CD mostly because it's a good intro to S&amp;G, and if you're not too into them, I think you might be inspired to get other albums of theirs.  That said, I hardly count some of these as &quot;Greatest  Hits.&quot;  Yes, there's Sound of Silence (the best song ever--but not the  best recording), Mrs. Robinson, The Boxer (get the live in Central Park  album for a couple of cool verses not included in this track), Scarborough  Fair/Canticle, Homeward Bound (a horrible recording--the one on Parsley  Sage, Rosemary and Thyme is million times better), El Condor Pasa, and  Cecilia, but there's also For Emily..., The 59th Street Bridge Song,  Kathy's Song, and Bookends, hardly primo stuff.  <br />Okay--some very good  songs, some not so good songs.  Yeah, it's worth the money, just to get  yourself acquainted, but you can find better recordings of the good songs,  and plenty of other songs that *should* have been included among the  &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; like Kodachrome/Maybellene, Patterns, Flowers  Never Bend with the Rainfall, and American Tune.  <br />Better buy if you want  the full monty of S&amp;G--try the Old Friends compilation (which I've  never heard because I already own all of their albums). <br />For individual  albums, try &quot;Parsley Sage , Rosemary and Thyme,&quot; &quot;The  Concert in Central Park&quot; (the sound quality isn't top notch, but a  great and extensive selection of songs with a really punchy beat not found  in a lot of studio recordings), and &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 a.m.&quot;
B00000JPH5|5.0|I have been a Bowie fan ever since I first heard him. Then I saw him, and he was even better! He can sing, play many instruments, and can REALLY ACT! Labyrinth is a great movie for people of all ages, I have pre-ordered it  already and have gotten all my friends to do the same.  If you are a Jim  Henson fan, this is your movie. If you are a David Bowie fan, this is your  movie. If you are between the age of 0-201, this is your movie, and there  is no other better place than here to buy it. You'll love this movie, or  atleast, you should, and I highly recommend it.
0783226845|1.0|&quot;Scent of a Woman&quot; is among the most overwrought films of all time, and is the most compelling evidence that director Martin Brest skipped the editing classes in film school. There are entire tracts in this  movie that serve neither to further the plot, nor to develop the  characters. Generally, those are the scenes you cut. In addition, the  marzipan ending made me cringe in my seat in the theater. Chris O'Donnell  may be the worst actor working today. His career is testament to the fact  that collegiate sweaters and a nice smile don't further one's acting  ability. And then there's the case of Al Pacino. There are parts in this  movie where he looks like he's doing comedic improvisation. That Pacino won  a Best Actor Oscar for this performance over Denzel Washington in  &quot;Malcolm X&quot; is one of the all time academy-voting travesties -  surpassed only be Tommy Lee Jones winning for &quot;The Fugitive&quot; over  Ralph Fiennes in &quot;Schindler's List.&quot; In sum, this movie is  entirely too long, too vapid, and just plain too bad.
0375707972|3.0|The Reader is not a book about a relationship. Although a relationship is the central element in the plot, the main focus of the book is what the relationship causes. This focus is aided by the fact that the book is  narrated by one of the two main characters in an autobiographical form.  This gives Schlink the ability to cast the characters in a protagonistic  light in the beginning of the book. The reader is thus encouraged to grow  familiar with the characters before knowing the whole story. Because of  this, if the reader is willing to have his/her opinions challenged they  will be, which in my mind makes this book worth reading.
0812589041|5.0|I never thought any book under the sci-fi genre could be so engaging. I read it within a day - half a day to be specific - not long before the major tests of the term. Not only was it engaging and interesting, I really  could identify with the main character Ender. It addresses issues about  life and humanity that I've been thinking about. It's an eye-opener, a  life-changing story and I won't ever regret having read it.<br />But I can't  garantee that you'll be satisfied after reading the book. it depends on how  deeply you choose to look into the story, or whether you look at it at the  same level the author was at when he wrote the book.
B000002B2T|4.0|After purchasing both the Temple of the Dog and Mad Season cds this past week, it seems clear to me which of these &quot;supergroups&quot; turned out the more successful album. Mad Season's combination clicks with soulful  precision on most tracks(&quot;Artificial Red&quot; just didn't do it for  me...sorry), and the album left me with a longing for more from these guys.  Don't let the four-star rating fool you though, I reserve that last star  for only the true greats(&quot;Ten,&quot; &quot;Harvest,&quot;  &quot;DSOTM,&quot; etc.)

B00000AFFF|4.0|well, i'm gonna make this review short and sweet. just like the album, very bitter-sweet. it was my first Elvis record that i bought and i was blown away with the emotion. if you don't enjoy Burt ( i can see why) buy  the album for &quot;what's her name today&quot;...my favourite track on the  whole album, and &quot;the sweetest punch&quot; is great too for those  who've had their heart broken...

0553062182|5.0|Those who will benefit most from this book are HSP's. Persons who do not see themselves in these pages are probably not truly HSP's. After reading it I felt 1) a great sense of relief that I am not alone and 2) it's really  OK to be me! If you've spent your whole life thinking there was nothing  special about you, that you are just like everyone else and should function  like everyone else and then beating up on yourself because you did *not*  function like everyone else...then you should buy and read this book.
B0000025YL|5.0|First Heard this title track back in 83 and I was totally floored. So much US 80's metal sounds cheesy today but this Hard Core EuroMetal will blow your socks off... This album helped me learn how to play guitar and play it  hard!!! The lyrics on the title track Restless and Wild are an anthem to be  remembered. This album was light years ahead of its time. <br />All the other  songs on this are a must for anybody who likes Rage Against the Machine and  Metallica.  This is not all thrash either listen to Princess of the Dawn  and hear the European Classical Music Influence and let your jaw drop !!!
0790729628|5.0|What you will see is not a mindless car chasing scene but a beautiful presentation of flying through megacity of future in an air car. A vision beyond it's time. That is the impression you will got in the begining of  the movie. Above all this is not the kind of check your brain by the door  kind of sci-fi, but an intelligent movie that explore the meaning of life,  literally. The dark mood created by image of smoggy sky, rainy cityscape  and heavy music by Vangilis that dominate the whole story but it is so  appropriated that the impact lingering for days.  A truely classic film  that deserve more.
B000002P7R|5.0|This is a pretty good Hendrix album.  It contains demos, alternate versions and previously un-relesased songs.
B00000IO4J|5.0|This movie was very well written, and I think the cast is excellent. It includes a member from every high school group, but they all work together, unlike in real life. My favorite charecter was Stokely, because her  knowledge of sci-fi (along with Zeke's cat.) I  think everyone will enjoy this movie because there is someone (and  something) for everyone in it.
0385493800|4.0|Like many others have stated, I enjoyed the plot of a fallen and lost man coming to find Christ.  However, Grisham has got to work on his endings.  I've read five of his books now, and the last three (The Partner, The  Street Lawyer and The Testament) have just had the most ridiculous and  unsatisfying endings.  They are so inconsistent with reality, not to  mention many of the people in his books remove themselves from character in  the last 20 or so pages.
B000005RTG|5.0|With the loss of Blackmore, the continuous rise of Zeppelin and big rock bands fast becoming dinosaurs, Deep Purple HAD to update their sound and come out fighting. I belive they achieved this with this album. The funk in  'Gettin' Tighter' and others was a turning point for the band and perhap  rock in general. Only a thought but maybe the band sensed the wheel was  turning in '75 and punk/disco was just around the corner. This album is  very good. Everyone can be proud of this offering.

630471288X|5.0|Being a Stephen King fan, I first read the novella upon which &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; is based when I was 12 and immediately considered it my favorite King work. What amazed me is how Frank Darabont  not only remained faithful to the book but made it his own and, more  importantly, into one of the decade's most moving. There's great poetry in  Morgan Freeman's voice and the last 15 minutes of the film absolutely  reduced me to tears. I can't wait until the DVD version is released so I  can appreciate the film in all its splendor.
0684874350|4.0|In my opinion,two things are important in a book.Firstly, the story itself and secondly, how its narrated. In &quot;Angela's ashes&quot;,the story is so vivid and real ,that in my mind a clear picture of Court's life was  spontaneously created when I was reading this book,even though that much  poverty and ardeousness was far from what my eyes could see.I must say  that,I couldn't imagine this much hardness before I read the book.Now I  feel more aware of the world and whats more I feel more strong than  ever.How little Francis survived from that world of absence and cruelty and  became a Pulitzer winner author is a miracle, or what?I liked the book and  I'm looking forward to read his upcoming book called &quot;Tis&quot; which  will be the second part of his story.
0451191153|1.0|My God in heaven I wish I'd never read this book. I could stand Anthem, but this was just a load of dogmatic garbage. I don't care if some of you think I'm purile or something for not liking this, it's my opinion you  peckerheads.
0140434674|5.0|Every time I finish another Austen novel, it becomes my &quot;favorite,&quot; and Persuasion is no different.  Perceptive, emotional, profound and even painful at times, it still sparkles with  Austen's humor and flair for turning a clever phrase.  Anne Elliot is a  heroine's heroine, and one with whom the reader feels an instant sympathy  and affection.  If only Jane Austen had been given more time on this earth  to share her splendid and amazing gift--but in the little time she did  have, she has given all of us who love her work a never ending source of  pleasure and enjoyment.  Persuasion in indeed a rare and priceless gem.

B00000JGOH|2.0|After hearing of the awards heaped upon this film, I expected great things.  How disappointed I was!  With a silly plot and over-acting (best actress?  Something is strange is going on in Hollywood), this picture is  not worth the money or the time.

6305128952|4.0|A highly under-appreciated film in the industry, &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot; is a poignant film of beauty and grace.  Robert Redford's wonderful movie proves that there is more to life than special effects, and  that the majestic landscape of Montana can help to soothe even the most  restless of souls, human or horse.
0671578278|5.0|This is another slam bang smash by Lois. I cannot begin to describe how incredibly funny, happy, sad, intricate and just plain magnificent this book is. If you're a Vorkosigan fan, this is IT. If you're wondering what  all the hoopla is about, you should read Komarr first. (That's according to  the author). Unlike most Science Fiction, Bujold writes a book that is long  on interpersonal interaction and short on My Eyes Glaze Over. The science  that is in her books, though, is very good and central to the story. The  plot about the Butter Bugs is sure to resonate through the rest of the  Miles books.<br />Oh, and I've never seen a better disastrous sad/farcical  scene than the dinner in ANY book.<br />Damn Fine Read Lois. Great Job!
0790734850|5.0|Unfortunately, I did not happen to witness the masterpiece known as &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; until after the Academy Awards in which &quot;Titanic&quot; made its sweep.  I was one of the blind few who jumped  the bandwagon - &quot;Yes!  'Titanic' must win!  It's the best film of the  year!&quot;  Boy, was I wrong!  The summer following the Oscars, I stumbled  across the DVD, then hard to find.  Having not seen the film, I purchased  it because of its reputation alone.  Suddenly &quot;Titanic&quot; became  merely a movie and &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; became a true film, one of  style and ability.  One thing about &quot;L.A. Confidential,&quot; (in my  last comparison to &quot;Titanic&quot;) is that &quot;Confidential&quot;  gets better and more twisted with every viewing.  &quot;Titanic&quot; just  gets longer.  I've seen &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; numerous times now,  and it seems that each time I watch it, I pick up something new.  I  definitely needed to watch it more than once in order to pick up on the  whole story.  &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; is SO dense, it's wonderful.   And don't forget the performances by a stellar cast - Guy Pearce, Russell  Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, James Cromwell and Kim Basinger all  shine in their roles, worthy of any award that could be bestowed upon them.   If you have not yet seen &quot;L.A. Confidential,&quot; or if you have  only seen it once, you need to experience the best movie of 1997 for  yourself.
B000002G26|5.0|This is a wonderful idea to have songs on the internet.  I had a song on my mind all day today, and couldn't remember the name.  It wasn't one of the songs that I could listen too, but as soon as I saw additional song  title's I knew which one it was.  &quot;I do it for you,&quot; now I can  sleep tonight.
0792156684|4.0|Yes, &quot;Titanic&quot; is just a movie.  Just like any other big-budgeted, over-rated, popular film, &quot;Titanic&quot; lacks many of the characteristics of a truly timeless classic.  The sad thing about  &quot;Titanic&quot; has nothing to do with the tragedy of the relationship  between Rose &amp; Jack.  For such a grand, beautifully pieced together and  filmed movie, &quot;Titanic&quot; lacks a decent script and only goes  surface-deep.  Compared to such excellent films as &quot;L.A.  Confidential&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; once you've seen  &quot;Titanic,&quot; you've seen all there is to see.  Great movies offer  something different every time you watch them.  I feel, however, that not  having more than a surface value is &quot;Titanic's&quot; only flaw.  James  Cameron paid so much attention to detail in his epic love story, that you  could even see the porthole frames fly off the boat as it broke in two.   The genius that saves the movie is the set design, art direction, James  Horner's astonishing score and Kate Winslet.  Forget Leo, ladies, Kate is  who carried &quot;Titanic&quot; out of the deep to modern-day cineplexes.   The DVD provides an excellent picture and sound transfer that preserves  &quot;Titanic's&quot; beautiful moments.  Now, if there were only a special  edition available...
B000002U88|4.0|I really only like a couple of songs on here, but I bought the album for Shame on the Moon, which is, I must say, absolutely magnificent.  I like to make mixed tape dubs for my friends and that song is one I put on every  tape.  So I give &quot;The Distance&quot; 4 stars based mainly on Shame and  Roll Me Away, which makes me want to jump on my motorcycle and head toward  the sunset every time I hear it.  Good job, Bob!
068815333X|5.0|The only thing I didn't like about this book is there isn't another one I can start reading.  I picked up Gone, Baby, Gone about 2 weeks ago and was immediately hooked on Patrick, Angie and Bubba.  Could not wait to read the  first books.  I wasn't disappointed.  If this is the first book you've read  in Mr. Lehane series I strongly recommend you read the rest.
0671578278|5.0|The best yet from this great author. I followed the preliminary chapters and could not wait to get my hands on the book. I had been out of the country for a week and with jetlag and all I never closed  my eyes until this book was finished. This is a first rate buy just to  relieve the stress with laughter.

B000007OY0|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  What can I say that hasn't already been said?  The acting is excellent, the story is fantastic, the surprising ending (I never would have guessed!) is exciting and touching.  I have high  hopes for 'The Green Mile'.  The novel is Stephen King's masterpiece, and I  have a feeling it might be every bit as good as Shawshank.  Let's all hope  so!

0792140346|5.0|What a vehicle for Norton to kick off a career with! A great story with well written characters and a plot twist to send you shivering! (We will ignor the presence of Richard Gere so we may enjoy the movie!)        This  is the movie that brought the style and sophistication of Ed Norton into my  view, and now I'm a huge fan! I believe that Norton is the best young actor  we have in Hollywood today. Once you see Primal Fear, you'll be compelled  to run out and see American History X, Rounders, and even clench your teeth  through Everyone Says I Love You and Larry Flynt, just to see this  brilliant actor sparkle!
0790729628|5.0|Harrison Ford is one of my favorite actors, that being the original reason I first watched, and pirated a VHS copy of the original 'Blade Runner'. I later purchased the 'Directors Cut', much to my disappointment. The  original version combines a sci-fi film with a dark, `50s style adventure.  The narrative of the original version being not only informative but most  entertaining. Too bad copies of the original version are not available for  sale on DVD. Bill Blackburn
B000006045|5.0|A great CD. I somehow loved &quot;Black Milk&quot;--very well done. A very Gothic, post apocalyptic mix of music...giving me the feeling that the future for all of us will be rather muted...and technology infested. Great  CD!!
B000002UAI|5.0|Yes, the boys were more or less biding their time with this one. But that is in a relative sense, considering the breathtaking leaps they were about to make, bounding from Rubber Soul to Revolver to Sgt. Peppers... But  listen carefully, and consider the context of the time in which it was  recorded. Thematically, nothing too deep, but musically, particularly the  12-string work on a couple of the numbers, this was folk rock-influenced  state of the art (the first Byrds records had just been released). And  another example of what made the Beatles so great; their throwaways weren't  throwaways, but exercises on the way to the next masterpiece, and pure  sonic pleasure to boot. Also, one request to all other closet critics-when  giving your opinion on the quality of the record, make it your own. Don't  cite polls and lists and charts to back it up; leave that nonsense to the  politicians. They should have nothing to do with your reaction to the  record-that is unless your skin is covered in wool.
B000000QFV|1.0|Please don't waste your money on a terrible Black Sabbath album that has only 1 original member, the desperate Tony Iommi.  Although the Norse mythology is attractive, the songs are poorly written.
B000001Y2U|4.0|A good cd with many good tracks.  Though beautiful people is the most acessable in the beginning, after further listening i felt The Reflecting God was the best song followed by Touriquet and 1996.  outstanding
6305470448|1.0|The customer reviewer from Winston-Salem who posted comments on 8-18-99 expressed my views perfectly. Actaully, it was so terrible I couldn't stand it and turned it off after about 20 minutes. In its favor I can only think  to say that at least Paltrow is graceful and attractive; her acting wasn't  bad but couldn't overcome the absolutely awful awful script; Dench was  inoffensive and may have lent relief from the misery later in the film if  she had been featured more and if I had been able to bring myself to watch.   Why hasn't anyone commented on how ill Fiennes looked (like a walking  corpse)? It struck me as a 90s version of a bad 50s historical adaptation  (I know this wasn't an adaptation)...Tony Curtis et al.  If you like  anachronistic, dumbed-down, almost-lowest-common denominator historical  comedy, you'll like this....I prefer Monte Python: at least they have  honest pretensions.
B000002C1Z|5.0|I've always felt that this album was underappreciated because it had no &quot;radio-length&quot; songs, and so got no radio-play.  It is among Pink Floyd's best sets.  The song 'Dogs' is a fifteen minute indictment of the  fake, back-stabbing, boot-licking corporate world.  (I listen when things  get bad at work.)  David Gilmour's snarling guitar work is awesome, and  Roger Waters delivers the lyrics with conviction and intensity.  The lyrics  show how if you play dirty, you can get ahead (&quot;You've got to be  trusted/by the people that you lie to/So that when they turn their backs on  you/You'll get the chance to put the knife in&quot;).  Then they show how  getting ahead isn't all it's cracked up to be (&quot;And it's too late to  lose the weight you used to need to throw around&quot;).   'Pigs' got a  little radio play, but was the weakest song on the album.  As such, it  still has a nasty guitar line and biting lyrics. 'Sheep' starts slow and  builds to a raging finale, as the timid sheep, content to be made into  meals for the Pigs and Dogs, later rise up and stampede for safety. All in  all, a great album, wonderful for listening to when you're in an angry,  mad-at-the-world mood!
031286504X|5.0|Many ppl will think of Richard Matheson along side of &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; his more commercial successfull book made into a movie, but &quot;I Am Legend&quot; blows it away this is trully one of the best books  ever written.  Matheson writes Neville like he actually knows the  loneliness of being the last man on the earth, i would have to say this  book ranks up there with the Grandmasters, Heinlein, and Bester.
0812589041|5.0|It doesn't matter who you are, what you usually like, where you live, how old you are, it doesn't matter! You need to read this book. I have a copy and so many of my friends have read it that the binding is falling apart.  Every one of them loved it. It is amazing. The plot is incredible. There is  a movie coming out with Jake Lloyd Alexander starring as Ender if nothing  goes wrong. If you have read this book and liked it ( or loved it) read  Philip Pullman's The Golden Compass. Another book on my shelf with almost  no binding left. Read them both!!! YOU WILL LOVE THEM!!
068484267X|2.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read.  I could not wait to finish reading it and quickly donating it to our local library.  I have never started reading a book without completing it, but I did contemplate  not finishing this one.    The book is too repetitious.  Each chapter  echoed the previous.
6303921248|5.0|We have watched this video for at least 5 times and we would watch it 5 more times! We have memorized lines that we use in our daily  conversations and we try to encourage every acquaintance to view it.  Great for a ladies'  get together! Some gentlemen might rightfully enjoy watching it too, were  it not for the generous revealing of cleavages.  We highly recommend this  movie to anyone still impressed with the old-fashioned or classic values,  excellent and noble.  This does not serve just for entertainment, but also  as a guide for a lady in waiting, that is a lady who is determined to marry  the right person for the right reason: love. This shows how at last, a lady  and a gentleman who at first could not stand each other learn through a  series of events, to forgive and accept each other and also love each other  very deeply.  Truly a surprising way to find your soul mate. The entire  cast, including the mother, Mrs. Bennett a tiresome and fickle person, was  splendidly chosen. The acting was superb and very natural!!!!!!  I wish and  I hope that BBC will endeavor to create other such masterpieces like the  rest of Jane Austen's writings, with the exception of Sense &amp;  Sensibility which was already done and do not believe can be topped.  ALSO,  let me mention the music was outstanding and wonderfully corresponding with  each actor.  In other words, we knew, I mean we knew when the carriage  brought Mr. Collins or Lady Catherine De Borg!!!  Anyway, I could go on and  on....I mostly enjoyed Lizzy's role and if I were an actress I would love  to act her.  She was very dignified, very ladylike, charming but pure,  fiesty but sweet.
0060930349|4.0|This book covers the history of the United States, from its conception to its present state. It is not, as one would expect, detailed in its narration of specific events such as the Civil War. Nevertheless, I was  please by the global view it gave of U.S. History. I would recommend it to  all.
630305904X|4.0|Most every frame of this film could be taken out, enlarged, and hung as a piece of art.  The cinematorgraphy is truly amazing.  The dialog, minimal as it is, is also very strong and the acting is great.  The only reason I  didn't give it a 5 is that it really seems to fall apart at the very end.   I really wish the war scene and the flying angel had been left of the  cutting room floor.  That aside, it is a must-have for anyone who truly  enjoys film.
B000003TAW|5.0|It's catchy, it's power packed and driven, and it's the best cd ever.  (In my humble opinion)   Weezer is great for everything... the car, a party, the shower. It is just the quintessential crowd pleaser.
6304595247|4.0|When I sat down to watch this film, everything from the cover front and back to my from-high-school assumptions about the original novel made me think I was going to suffer through 2 hours of a chick-flick.  After 10  minutes I was glued to the screen.  Great scenery, costumes, and acting.  I  agree Binoche's performance wasn't as strong as Fiennes', but it was not  distracting.  After the film ended I sat silent and stunned- I could have  easily watched another hour.  This is also one of Ryuichi Sakamoto's best  soundtracks .  The only two complaints I have are that the LD transfer was  not letterbox...  the scenery was beautiful and I'm sure the pan-&amp;-scan  cropped a lot off... and that I can't find anywhere to buy the brilliant  soundtrack.
0671578278|5.0|I read the first ten chapters on Baen's web site and immediately bought the hardcover.  My husband did the same, so we now have two copies...and have each read it about four times in less than a week.  I am *so* glad  Bujold is letting Miles grow up, become an adult, and have to face the  consequences of his actions.  And the butter bug subplot - !  Stunning.   Absolutely stunning.  My only complaint was the hideous cover art, but  that's besides the point.  Somehow I think Dorothy, Georgette, Charlotte  and Jane would be proud.
B000000W5L|5.0|For me the Stones were at their peak in this period (prior to stadium concerts sponsored by SPRINT!).  Shame they lost Mick Taylor.   Wonderful sax and piano.  Exile along with Sticky Fingers and Get Yer Ya Ya's Out are  my three favorites.   After that (with the lone exception of Some Girls) -  I'd say forget it boyz!
0790729652|4.0|`Nuff said about the film itself in the other reviews...<br /> The DVD quality was OK. The picture was clear, but a little wobbly at the start. Sound quality was good, but not much use made of surround with the film  being made in 1989. Shame there's not much extra on the disc though.
0061007137|5.0|This is the first Jeffrey Archer book that I have read. I can assure you that it won't be the last. I thoroughly enjoyed this adventure-suspense nov el. From the time that Adam Scott opens a letter which was given to him as  part of a bequest from his deceased father's will, he is placed on a  perilous path between life and death with many unpredictable twists and  turns along the way. His search for the Russian icon of St. George and the  Dragon coincides with similar searches by the Russian KGB and the  Americans. How he manages to locate the icon and to eventually outwit his  adversaries makes for an exciting story. I found this book hard to put down  once I started it.
0441172717|5.0|I first saw the movie &quot;Dune&quot;, which is awful.  David Lynch revels in the grotesque and overuses character thoughts (which works in the text but is overbearing in the movie) to ruin a good thing.  Fortunately,  the book is one of the best pieces of fiction I have ever read.  It is  chock full of archetypal themes, including the hero journey, and is just  simply gripping.  There is superb character development, internal and  external character tension, and a helluva good story.  If you saw the movie  and hated it, approach the book with an open mind.  It does not have many  of Lynch's absurd interpretations or fabrications and will astonish you
B00000JHAU|2.0|I dunno...it's not a terrible album by any means, but certainly not worthy of the copious amounts of praise everyone's heaping on it.  Don't get me wrong; I like wordy, pseudo-intellectual music as much as the next person,  but I find large portions of If You're Feeling Sinister to be intensely  irritating.  Most of their lyrics, to be frank, really aren't *all that*  clever--a flaw which could be overlooked if the melodies were better, but  they really aren't much either; many of them have a kind of annoying  sing-songy quality to them, and Murdoch's voice can become very annoying  indeed, especially since he sings everything in basically the same tone.   Okay, it has a few halfway decent tunes (Stars of Track and Field, Get Me  Away From Here...), but I have to say it: The Boy With the Arab Strap is an  infinitely better album; If ...Sinister... had been been my first taste of  B&amp;S, I can safely say I would never have given them a second glance.   That's all.
1558807381|5.0|Legend is just one more of Ridley Scott's movies that has been savaged, many of the key scenes ending up on the cutting-room floor, and sound artistic integration - a true artist's fort&eacute; - dismembered by blockheads.  Sure, there's the infamous Ford voice-over and other art-crimes against his  integrity - but name another movie that had the *entire score* (a classical  one at that) replaced.  Jerry Goldsmith's work is integral to the film,  every bit as crucial as the character-based themes expressed in Vangelis'  Blade Runner score.<br />This movie is just what it purports to be: a legend,  with the timeless struggle of good and evil, the children of light and  darkness, thrown into high relief.  It is also film-making in the best  tradition (e.g. Fritz Lang), with every fallen leaf or snowflake there  because the director wanted it so.  Why, then, hack 20 minutes of important  material and insult the taste and intelligence of the American  audiences?<br />The actors in Ridley Scott's movies, from Mia Sara and Tom  Cruise, to Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sigourney Weaver (Alien and 1492),  must feel tremendous gratitude for the way they amaze and delight - for he  is nothing if not an actor's director.  Why, then, do the three principal  actors in Legend (Cruise, Sara, Curry) have important,  character-establishing lines slashed from their dialogue?<br />In sum, you  would be best, as would the Hollywood powers that be, to respect the  director and hold out for the film the way he envisioned it.  Buy the PAL  version in Europe and transfer it (a poor substitute), or better yet, write  a letter encouraging the release of a DVD version.  See for yourself how  little respect this visionary director got - and enjoy a real legend of  film.
B000003BEM|5.0|With the start off track &quot;sympathy for the devil&quot;,you know that the stones were trying something new.Unlike the predecesor &quot;satanic majesties request&quot;,this one is full of fresh ideas and doesnt get  cloyed in psychedelia.A must have for any fan of music in  general.Brilliant.
B00000I0XW|5.0|Fans of Sarah and Andrew Lloyd Webber greatly benefit from this sparkling CD. There are many highlights in this collection. My personal favorites include &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, &quot;Love Changes  Everything&quot;, &quot;Amigos Para Siempre&quot;, &quot;Mecavity: The  Mystery Cat&quot;, and &quot;Pie Jesu&quot;.
B00000K19E|5.0|very exciting movie.......worth watching several times....recommended to many friends and they all thanked me....bought it as soon as it was available  and amazon.com by far  had the best price of  internet places i  looked.
B00000IL1K|5.0|If the Garden of Eden had a CD, it would probably be this one. Sarah has an incredible range and sound. If you have seen her &quot;One Night in Eden&quot; concert, you will recognize many of these delightfully ethreal  songs. &quot;Eden&quot;, &quot;Anytime Anywhere&quot;, &quot;Il Mio Cuore  Va&quot;, and &quot;Deliver Me&quot; are just a few excellent reasons to  get this CD.
B000003NA4|2.0|Before I begin, I must say in preface that I know my opinion is in the extreme minority.  my  feelings about Diana Krall are not coming from somebody who doesn't know  anything about Jazz. With all of that said, I will say that Ms. Krall as a  pianist is top rate, showcasing much with a style that is all her own but  also harkens back to the wonderful years gone by, especially Nat King Cole.   As a vocalist, however, I find her extremely unappealing, uninspired, and  unfealing.  Her style comes across to me as very forced and exaggerated.   And believe me, after reading the rest of these comments, I listened to the  album again just to try to find what everyone else is talking about. I  can't hear it. When I think of great Jazz vocalists, I just can't put  Diana's CD on the same shelf as Ella, Sarah, Anita (O'Day), Nina, or of course,  Billie, it just doesn't belong.  Although Diana Krall's piano skills are  exceptional, I offer that if you would like to hear a female jazz  pianist/vocalist, then go back to some of Nina Simone's recordings, or  check out Carmen MacRae, or Shirley Horn. As far as modern jazz tributes  go, have a listen to Cassandra Wilson's tribute to Miles Davis,  Travelin'Miles.  It is my opinion that we are forgetting the traits that  have been always present in the women that we call legendary Jazz  vocalists. While her efforts are commendable, I feel that vocally, Diana  Krall will not withstand the test of time.  I know I sound rather harsh in  this review, but go put on some classic Ella or Billie or Sarah and you'll  realize the type of ruler that I measure greatness by. I just can't accept  less.
6303114946|5.0|Much more a deeply thoughtful and thought-provoking film about relationships between parent and teacher and child/student than a film about a chess prodigy.  You don't have to know or care anything about the  game of chess to find viewing this film to be a deeply moving experience.   Every parent and teacher struggles with how to encourage and teach a child  to be his or her best without pushing in a harmful way.  Most parents know  that competition in life can't be avoided, but that children can be harmed  and/or can benefit from their participation in competitive activities run  by (for?) adults.  A side issue faced in a few families is whether and how  a child with world-class skills can still lead a normal life and just be a  regular child at times.  &quot;Searching for Bobby Fisher&quot; addresses  these issues better than any other film I can think of.  The acting is  outstanding; everyone is very convincing in his and her roles.  The editing  and cinematography in this film are also especially effective at telling  the story.  Bravo!
B000003NA4|5.0|Catch the track &quot;Garden in the Rain.&quot; Wow. Bring it on
B00000ILBK|4.0|Describing this as a long episode is pretty accurate.   None of the special effects looked bad, and a few looked very good.  In terms of the even/odd curse, this could have been a lot worse.  If you like star trek in  general, this is a good bet.  It is not first contact though which even  people who hated star trek liked.
B0000025H6|5.0|Undescrible!! Along with Dark Side of the Moon, this album deserves to be in anybodies music collection.
6304711921|5.0|At a time where stop-frame is becoming a lost art, it is refreshing to see something so original, professional, and stylish.  As far as our friend from Oklahoma is concerned in terms of it being &quot;to&quot; violent, I  think that he misunderstands.  It is not a movie that is directed towards  very young children (ie. four).  Older children and adults are sure to  appreciate it.
0380796090|5.0|one of the funniest reads of the nineties
0688158129|5.0|I was looking through the library for a good read..and stumbled upon this wonderful story.  At first I did have a hard time getting into it, but last night, with more than half way too go..I finished it!  WHAT A BOOK!!!  I am  still thinking about chris and emily.    Jodi Picoult is an amazingly  talented writer. I love her writing style.  She develops her main  character's so well you feel close to them.   I think she is one of the  best writers I have read in all my years as a reader.  I plan to read the  rest of her books.  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK&lt; JODI!!!
6305537798|5.0|As a 30 year old woman and a huge fan of Shakespeare I have only one thing to say about this movie: I LOVED IT! It was faithful to the original, yet fresh and fun. I think this is the kind of movie that could get kids  interested in old &quot;Will&quot;.
0385493800|2.0|John Grisham, one of my favorite authors, has struck out with this one.  I really had to force myself to keep reading until the end.  I hated being mired down in the dreary effort the main   character went through to  attempt to meet his ultimate goal.  <br />A few months later I read &quot;The  Codicil&quot; by Tom Torpor written in 1993, which is a superior book in  every way.  I would give it 10 stars!  Same premise as &quot;The  Testament&quot; but much better done.  <br />I will, of course, read Grisham's  next book.  Maybe he just needed to take a breath and build up some steam.
0800196341|5.0|A really great interpretation of Shakespears work
B0000029LG|5.0|HIStory is really good. it's the best album i've ever heard
B0000024SD|5.0|Excellent album!!!!!! Bob outdid himself on this one.  The first half of the album offers Dylan's first electrical attempts, and he really pulls it off terrifically.  The songs are short, sometimes funny, and always  interesting.  The second half of the album, though, starting with Mr.  Tambourine man, is wherethe best songs are.  These are more classic Dylan,  and you can listen to them over and over and over and always discover  something new and interesting about them.  This is a must album for any  Dylan fan, and even if you don't like Dylan, get it, cause this is one of  the most influential albums of all time.  Seriously.  Chances are, any band  that played after this album was released was at least indirectly  influenced by this album.  Gems: There are so many!! And the ones I don't  name are well known or interesting in their own way. But my favorites are:   She Belongs to Me, Love Minus Zero/No LImit, Mr. Tambourine Man, It's  Alright.  Get this album!!!!!
B0000025RI|5.0|Really good cd! The greatest
6305388458|5.0|Despite (or maybe because of) the vitriol of extremely ignorant people who can make a judgement about something they haven't seen and would probably never comprehend, Python managed to produce one of the funniest and most  infamous films ever.<br />The Pythons started with a title: &quot;Jesus  Christ: Lust for glory&quot; but they soon moved their sights and aimed the  film at mindless organised religion and religious hysteria - at exactly the  sort of people who still find this film so offensive.<br />The jokes are  funny, the filming is excellent - buy it!
B00000J7J4|3.0|Carlos Santana is one of the greatest living musicians, but it's been more than 20 years since he recorded an album that was as vital or creative as the early work he's best known for.  While this new record is not exactly a  return to his younger form, it's miles ahead of some of the lackluster  efforts we've seen in the 80s and 90s.  Now that Santana has become an  &quot;elder statesman&quot; it seems appropriate that he collaborate with  younger artists to reintroduce his sound to a new generation.  The result  is uneven --- you couldn't expect any different with all the different  performers involved --- but it offers a synthesis of old and new that is  very appealing, much in the same way the John Lee Hooker's &quot;The  Healer&quot; used guest stars (most notably Santana!) 10 years ago to give  the blues legend a commercial and critical success.  This is easily  Santana's best album since &quot;Shango&quot;, or for that matter,  &quot;Moonflower&quot;.
B000009O8A|3.0|This film has most of the qualities that make satisfying horror cult films: low budget, mindless script, amateurish acting, shocking brutality and gore galore. If this is your cup of tea, the movie lives up to its  hype.
B000001ES9|3.0|Their first album, and it should be taken as such. There are some strong efforts on this album, like &quot;Working Man&quot; and &quot;Finding my Way&quot;, but the rest is uninspired. All the essential pieces are  included in &quot;Chronicles&quot;, &quot;Retrospective 1974-80&quot; and  even &quot;All the World's a Stage&quot;, so this album is a necessity for  hardcore fans only.
B000002W4V|5.0|A superb band, underrated then and still. The Hunter/Wagner duets and harmonies are precise, dead-on...soar and rock like little else done in their time. Damn! but this album blew me away when it first came out - and  still does. Couldn't get enough of it. Never was or have been that keen on  Reed, but his mutant-biker bisexual-Frankenstein- monster from NYC hell  image and delivery of these tunes fits the bill: the perfect dead-pan  complement/counterpoint to the rearrangements: raging,ironic  and  acid-humorous.It all sounds to me  something like ProtoMetal  Beethoven-ish (yeah! no exag) renditions of Reed\Velvet classics by a  tight, powerful, economical andgraceful kick-a** band.Here's the sour note:  This baby deserves - demands -  a remastering. Now! And, what about its  less satisfying but still required sequel? - gray cover, LR LIVE? - from  same performances. Needs to be released on CD, guys!Forget what Lou says,  nevermind the rest of the nit-picking: aint many live albums that can  compare to this mug. it's one of the  greats!
0385484518|5.0|I had read the Chinese version of &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; twice half a year ago. I love this book so much that I decides to buy the original (English) version and read it again. The words touched me and  inspired me. I would like to share this book with my family and friends.
B000002BUY|5.0|This is truly a breakthrough CD. It brings together many diverse sounds and instruments and meshes them seamlessly. First of all, when they do a time change in their songs they lead up to it and it fits within the song,  unlike Korn, who will rock fast and all of a sudden slow it down for no  real reason. Secondly, they utilize their DJ (DJ Lyfe) more effectively  than other bands like Limp Bizkit, who's DJ Lethal seems like an  afterthought. They also boast a GREAT singer (how many bands can you say  THAT about nowadays...) and very strong, deep lyrics.  The band is not  afraid to use unique sounds in their songs, either, and end up with some  great results. The CD rocks, ( Redefine, Vitamin, New Skin) funks out,  (Anti-Gravity Love Song, Deep Inside, Glass) and just plain blows your mind  (Calogne, which starts out as one of the worst songs you've ever heard, but  about 15 seconds in starts rocking so hard that you better not be driving  or you'll kill someone!) Incubus is a wonderful band and I hope to see more  of them in the future. Well done!
6304578482|5.0|I thought that Lisa Kudrow was very good in the role of Romy and I thought that Mira Sorvino was good too but I felt that another actress should have played michelle. Other than that it was a great movie in which everyone  tryed hard.
0671578278|5.0|I thought 'komarr' was quite a flat and unfunny book by this author, but this book has to be the funniest in the series and one of the best reads I have had in a long time.  Really worth buying. I'm looking forward to  Miles's upcoming adventurs and what trouble his family and friends get into  as well.
630512762X|5.0|thanks to great performances, great directing, nonstop action, mind-blowing visuals &amp; some great humour too, this movie is one hell of a rollercoaster ride! action fans, if ya missed this one ya must have been  in a coma.
0345298349|5.0|I agree with everyone else. An incredible book. I have read it 4 or 5 times over the years. One of those books like True Grit, Shogun, The Black Marble, and Lonesome Dove I can always return to for enjoyment. And yes,  Polar Star and Red Square are excellent too! Cruz does an excellent job on  &quot;Rose&quot; also, a &quot;period&quot; book. Good writer.
0800177975|2.0|After making numerous hits, this was Arnold Schwarzenegger's streak-breaker. Great and very original plot, but VERY badly done. It tried hard to be funny where it shouldn't have. Annoying kid had too much screen  time. I'm a big fan of Schwarzenegger and I was extremely disappointed with  this film.
6305513406|5.0|Star Trek has finally been given the format it deserves. Now I no longer have to wonder how long my tapes will last or if my VCR will decide to have them for lunch! Yes there could be more on the discs but if you are really  a fan of Star Trek you should be more than happy with the fact that the  episodes made it to DVD at all. As for the interviews that could be a  problem between the Sci-Fi channel and Paramount I'm sure the Sci-Fi  channel holds the rights to the interviews and perhaps they will come out  on a special interview DVD that would contain the complete interview at  once instead of snippets here and there. Overall I think it is great to  have the series in this format and 2 episodes per disc keeps the price per  disc very reasonable I'm sure not everyone will collect the whole series  and 4 or 6 episodes per disc would probably be giving a lot of people   episodes that they didn't want but had to pay for anyway. &quot;Live Long  And Prosper&quot;
B00000K2SE|5.0|One of the most well done movies I've seen.  Great movie
0671578278|5.0|_A Civil Campaign_ is an excellent addition to the Vorkosigan universe. As usual, the prose is deceptively easy to read but the ideas contained in the clear prose are time bombs. The book has something for all thoughtful  readers. It should satisfy both science fiction and romance readers. It is  a roller coaster of a book. The &quot;laugh out loud&quot; parts are  balanced by the parts that deal with honor (and the struggle to maintain  it). This book will be on my &quot;to be reread frequently&quot; shelf.
B00000JPH5|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  It is my favorite.  It has a dash of mystery mixed in with just enough romance to keep the viewer wondering &quot;What is going to happen--Really?&quot; I recommend this for all ages  who need a break from real life.
B000002JR8|1.0|Nothing but a bunch of noise. I can imagine being in a prison and having this blasting out of another convict's stereo. Phil Anselmo seems to be trapped in a prison. He sounds like he is giving birth. Or having a limb  amputed. I can imagine other great guitarists other than Dimebag.
0684803356|5.0|I first read this book a couple of years ago, and it developed, for me, a love of reading.  In this book,  Hemingway  combines everything which makes him a great writer:  a powerful story, wonderfully developed characters,  and twists, which you don't expect.  I recently reread this book and found  it to be better than the first time I read it.  I can honestly say it is  one of the top books I've ever read, and definitely the best Hemingway  novel I've ever read.
0380973464|5.0|If you wondered, like I did why Stephenson was lying low...  If you had any concern that the next one wouldn't live up, well, rest assured. The reason, I suspect, that this one was so long in coming might be simply that  this novel is really two novels - each neatly developed, and expertly mixed  with the other.  Both storylines have great charachters, from the  kind-of-wierd pacific theatre U.S. Marine non-com who seems to be washing  up on beaches all around the world in some of the strangest action WWII  probably saw, to the modern day I.T. entrepeneur, who's current Data  management enterprise both ties him into old war history, and at the same  time promises to create a shift in society of a similar magnitude to those  from the end of the first half of the century.  Themes:Cryptography, its  wartime application, and current value as a economic tool of the  information age, Business Adventure, Wargold. This book is truly  compelling, funny, and insightful throughout.  Hope you have a few days  with nothing else to do, 'cause it could really snag you. Have fun!
B000001FI7|5.0|when i listened to this record, i was just a displaced boy, who thougth was the only one who like this type of music. When i listened ( and loved it) and i saw their fame growing, I was marvelous. This is one of the best  albuns ever, and I recommend it. To the time with your valentine, in  depression, in thinking, in everything.. Buy it!! It is great!!!
0767803434|1.0|The first scene, in which the noble and much-applauded American president circumvents his advisors and chooses conscience and human rights over political expediency, should tip you off right away: neither plot, nor  character, and not even the acting, is believable in this waste of a movie.
B0000041Z6|2.0|Sorry folks, but as much as I love Solti, and I agree that the Chicago Symphony is the greatest orchestra in the world, I can't really recommend this set, even at the bargain price. Yes, Solti does deserve his spot among  the great Mahlerians; his Mahler's Eighth is arguably the best available,  and I do get a guilty pleasure from his Second.  Still, Solti only captures  half of Mahler's world at best; he has little sensitivity for the  reflective and delicate emotional aspects of Mahler's music.  In all  fairness, no single boxed-set of Mahler's symphonies by any one conductor  adequately captures the whole of Mahler's music; perhaps Kubelik's comes  closest.  At any rate, before you declare yourself a Solti/Mahler die-hard,  give a listen to Horenstein's Third, Barbirolli's Fifth, and Bernstein's  Ninth with the Berlin Philharmonic (not the Vienna Philharmonic).  You owe  yourself a listen to the very best of Mahler.
B00000J7J4|5.0|His best album in years. Words can't do it justice.  With the exception of one track the albumn is perfection.  If he doesn't get a Grammy for this, well those people don't know jack about music anyway.
0671578278|5.0|This book has a major problem, IT ENDS. I started reading LMB with The Warrior's Aprentice and have since read all she has written, and she has never dissapointed me. ACC is no exception. In, what for me, has been a  very good summer for the type of science fiction that I like ACC is the  icing on the cake. I can not recommend it highly enough
0060926317|5.0|When I read this book I would just stop and sob. Why? Because it was the first time I ever heard people living values that meant everything to me and to my deepest needs. It was like finding a home that I did not even  know existed. This is a story about living without the ego creating images  of falsehood in daily life and presentation. It is a real example of real  people living truth - of themselves - in humility and respect on this  planet. Honors &amp; Bravo to them and Marlo!
B000001F4V|3.0|Scorpions reached their maximum popularity in the U.S. with this recording, the fourth featuring guitarrist Matthias Jabs, who replaced the irreplacable Ulrich Roth. But, with Matthias, hte band worked even harder  to obtain recognition from the media an the public, and it got it,  deservedly. After that, their sound became purely commercial music.
0141301066|5.0|This book is not only for a child. It's very funny and entertaining. Matilda made me want to read books like she did.
B0000025IE|5.0|THis is real heavy-metal. This is real rock'n roll. THis is real hard stuff. THis is real singing, real riffs, real lyrics. One of the best Metal albuns of the 80's. Fantastic, even without having amazing musicians on it  (read: Dave Holland on drums and Ian Hill on bass)
6303921248|5.0|This movie is the most wonderful movie...every role is perfectly casted, especially my absolute favorites &quot;Miss E. Bennett and Mr. Darcy&quot;.  I purchased this movie and now am totally addicted to it.  I watch it  almost every weekend!
1573226521|3.0|The book is a pageturner, no question.  Still it was a thriller, NOT a masterpiece!  I must congratulate Mr. Garland on a brilliant psycho-thriller that definately got  into and under this veteran traveler's skin.  I felt a  been-there-done-that-jesus-that-could-have-been-me-and-I-know-those-people,  kind of feeling the whole way through. Its a good read.  Its worth it.  But  it should be compared with the likes of Stephen King, NOT Golding or  Huxley.
0792156684|5.0|I love this move. The reseach on this movie was so vast and well done, that if you forget about Rose &amp; Jack for a moment, you will be taken back in time to that infamous day 4-13-12. Every book I've read ( 12 )  convinces me more and more of the film's historical accuracy. The special  effects are beyond good there great. I  am a former Merchant Seaman who has  worked on old vessels in the past. So, I know the details that were made to  show that you are on a ship was fantasic. I constantly watch this film for  technical mistakes. There are some, but big deal. Watch the movie, buy a  book, buy a music cd. Yes TITANIC GETS 100 STARS FROM ME.
0790734850|5.0|This film is an absolute masterpiece, and is the equal of any academy award-winning film, including Titanic.  L.A. Confidential is one of those rare pictures, like The Godfather, which seems flawless - all the loose  ends are tied up perfectly.  Russell Crowe steals the show as Bud White, a  brutal thug of a cop who begins to realize his humanity and intelligence  despite the wishes of his captain.  He is supported by Guy Pierce, whose Ed  Exley is an idealistic crusader dragged down by the reality of life, and  the always excellent Kevin Spacey, whose character is caught up in  behind-the-scenes Hollywood but losing his taste for the heartless wheeling  and dealing.  Kim Basinger shines as a high-class hooker wanting more from  life, but was less deserving of the Oscar she won than Spacey, Pierce or  especially Crowe.  Throw in Danny Devito as a sleasy tabloid publisher,  David Strathairn as a shady millionaire pimp, and James Cromwell (180  degrees removed from the gentle farmer of Babe) as the sinister police  captain who is much more than he seems, and you have the makings of one of  the greatest films of all time.<br />I will give away no further details,  except to say WATCH THIS FILM.  It should have won all the awards, and  Titanic sinks by comparison.<br />
B00000IAU3|5.0|If you like N. Merchant and/orSarah MacLachlan you will loveDido.  Such a beautiful voiceand you can understand everyword.  Can't wait for her nextCD.
B000002MNL|5.0|Yet another excellent outing with Morrissey.  This has to be one of his most soothing cds.  This, however, is not to say that there aren't some great high energy tracks such as &quot;Speedway&quot;.  &quot;Why Don't You  Find Out For Yourself&quot; is one of the best songs he has ever written  and in &quot;Lifeguard Sleeping, Girl Drowning&quot; Morrissey experiments  with his vocal delivery with smashingly creepy results.   I know that all  of his songs are very personal but I find this to be his most personal work  to date.
0812046625|4.0|I have owned this book for several years, and have often found it invaluable.  It provides complete conjugations, and is easy to use.  It is only limited to 501 verbs, but it contains most of the commonly used verbs.   It does not, however, give any examples of verb usage, which would often  prove helpful.  Still, it is a valuable book to have.
B000002LOM|5.0|I certainly can understand why some people wouldn't think this is Morrissey's greatest cd.  But I can NOT understand why &quot;fans&quot; have trashed it.  No other Morrissey cd blends silly, happy songs better  with more serious ones.  It will probably not go down in history as  Morrissey's most &quot;important&quot; work (but who could ever narrow that  down to one cd anyway?) but it is one of his most fun.
B00000JLXG|5.0|I am a 38 year old woman so I don't fall for every &quot;romantic&quot; movie that comes along. I don't know quite what it is about Titanic that touches me and everyone else so,but it's there in this movie.I have seen  this movie 27 times over the months that it has been released in theatres.  I think anyone who has experienced the love that this movie represents can  relate, and even if you have not found that love,you wish it to be out  there.Titanic hits you in the gut in not one, but many different scenes.  The talent demonstrated by both DiCaprio and Winslett is beyond  comparrison. Subsequently I have seen all of DiCaprio's dramatic films and  I am impressed beyond belief at the talent and range of emotions this man  has.Winslett in Heavenly Creatures was wonderful. But Titanic will always  have a special place in my heart. A film beyond comparrison.
B00000ILBK|4.0|This movie needed more action with the ships. When you have a ship like the Enterprise E, you have to show it as much as possible. Even better when it's in battle.
6302468027|5.0|I just love movies where you get to hear the characters tell stories.  Especially, hearing Ninny Threadgoode tell one!  Jessica Tandy will bring warmth to your heart and laughter to your soul, as she carries you (and  Kathy Bates) away with her delightful storytelling.   Idgy Threadgoode and  Ruth Jamison portray the naughty and good sides of people living back in  the 30s.  You can't help but love Idgie's spunky/dogmatic character, while  holding a protective/motherly love for the gentle, sweet Ruth.  These two  have the time of their lives together and show true devotion in friendship.    Be enveloped into the scenes as Ninny tells them, keep those tissues at  hand and have your own copy, because you won't watch it only once!
0792838912|5.0|So many people miss the main point of this movie because it's so stylish and aesthetic -- the film shows graphically what happens between men and women when men quash their feelings. It comes out in obsessive ways -- pushing the boundries of physical relationships to the point of insanity. This film is superb ~ It should be seen from another paradyme. Ps. This is also a GREAT soundtrack, great music from an eclectic array of artists including Brian Ferry, Cory Hart and others.
0671578278|3.0|I'm a HUGE fan of Miles &amp; Co.  A Civil Campaign is very enjoyable, but we don't get a great amount of character development--except with Ivan.  Is it just me?  Or does Ivan get smarter with each book?  Don't read the rest  of this review if you haven't read the book yet.<br />I wish we had more about  Cordelia (my fave character) and Aral.  And Mark isn't appealing (I liked  him in Mirror Dance)...why would Kareen be interested in him?  <br />The  butter bugs were the predictable part of the book.  Once introduced, I  already &quot;knew&quot; that they would be engineered with the Vorkosigan  slogan, and then escape.  It could have been much funnier.<br />But, Ms.  Bujold, keep it coming.  I just love your characters.
B00000JCB3|5.0|it is a great c
B00000J7JO|5.0|very impressed! this is the new background music in our home! i love it! very good comeback for the chili peppers,worth every penny! if you do not have this as a part of your cd collection,go get it! definately worth it!
0899661351|5.0|If there were a more enlightened journey, show me the way! Doubt so. This is the quintessential reading for anyone who wish to sample the beauty of Kerouac's writing. The marrow is not in the destination, but the journey,  the trip. Latch on to god's finger, kiss it, and when you feel like it, let  go and see where you land!
0671578278|5.0|that will make you laugh and cry and cheer them on. I've been reading her books for years, and they have only gotten better. This is character-driven adventure with a powerful message. Miles continues to grow and mature, and  it's wonderful to watch.
0671578278|5.0|My only complaint is that it ended, and we'll be waiting another year for the next one. I'm sure it will be worth the wait. LMB continues to be my favorite SF author. Thank you, thank you, thank you!
B000006OAM|4.0|Natalie Merchant reveals a distinct, haunting style in this enchanting album.  The beautiful collection of songs have subtle philosophical undertones,  it's just a shame she didn't extend this gift to her design of  the inlay card.  7 pictures of Miss Merchant in drastically different  images, presumably conveying her multi-faceted character ... the junkie,  achiever, bookworm, pious nun, party animal and defiant circus freak.    Really, the album spoke for itself ... without the need for this feeble  visual attempt at demonstrating her diversity.
B00000J8EK|5.0|buy this cd, i love song one, great beat!! song 2 also has a great effect,   this is a great techno cd, listen to it first to make sure you like it though......then buy it
B00000IL1K|5.0|This album was by far Sarah Brightman's most amazing works. She has a very eccetic selection and does amazing work on these songs.
B000000WZ4|3.0|Depeche Mode is my all time favorite band, but their most recent recordings from this album on have been a allot weaker compared to the 5  albums before this.  I think the band has suffred allot from Alan leaving  the band.  It may sound strange to some, but I look more forward to his  next solo album under the &quot;Recoil&quot; name than the next Mode  record.  Maybe the guys are just losing their edge as they get older.   Don't get me wrong the album has 3 awesome tracks Barrel of a gun, Home,  and Freestate....
0375707972|4.0|I enjoyed The Reader for many reasons that others may not have.  It was, as the narrator points out, a metaphor for involuntary and voluntary love.  We involuntarily love only our parents, Michael Berg says.  Berg falls in  love with, of all people, a concentration camp guard, woman he describes in  one place as a horse.  Despite the &quot;juxtaposition of oversentivity and  callousness&quot; he feels when he thinks of her, and her almost  overwhelming strength, she washes him and takes care of him and encourages  him.  The story unfolds of one generation falling in love, involuntarily,  with another --- with one that is flawed.        And yet, almost in a way  Nabokovian (Lolita) and Dostoevkian (Crime and Punishment), there is  redemption.  Hanna, the concentration camp guard, learns to read in prison  and discovers her crimes and her complicity.  She does what mankind has  done when confronted with its crimes --- she feels guilt.        This book  is about guilt and the ability of Germans (and all others) to accept the  weaknesses of their parents without giving up that love.  Ironically, it is  the reverse of many books that explore the guilt of parents for the  weaknesses of their children.        I liked it.
6305470464|5.0|Just finished watching the movie.  What a great flick!!!!!!  I drenched my pillow with tears and had some hearty laughs.  Excellent acting from all sides!!!!  GO GET THIS FILM!!!!!!!!!
0767819462|5.0|If you are not touched after watching this film, than you are not human.  This is a wonderful human story that is sure to bring tears to your eyes.  Susan Sarandon is a marval.  She interacted with Julia Roberts so well.  The children are also gems.  If your in the mood for a sentimental,  tear-jerker, than this movie is for you.  I recommend it highly.
6300215954|4.0|This is not a typical John Wayne movie. Although Wayne plays his typical strong, silent man role, he is served a come-uppance by a woman... and by 3 baby elephants! After watching this film, who could forget Henry Mancini's  &quot;Baby Elephant Walk?&quot; A. Wallingford
630407185X|5.0|This movie isn't like usual war movie just showing war, this brings you into the planing of the battle, from both sides, and really shows you what is was like to be in Holland in 1944.   Its a great film.
0451169514|5.0|I felt that &quot;It&quot; was a bit too long.  After a while, I became numb to any of the horror elements that were in the book.  That doesn't mean that I didn't like it.  I really liked the book and that is why I  write this now.  Don't get me wrong, I found it hard to leave my room at  night without thinking that I might see a clown, but &quot;It&quot; touched  me in another way.  Since the book was long, I almost felt like I lost my  friends when it was over.  I think that is where the strength of this book  lies.  The power of friendship and love.  I don't think that I'll forget  the Losers anytime soon!  They are a part of me and probably all of us.
0374115370|5.0|This is my favorite book by my favorite author.  It is a book I pick up from time to time, flip open to any page and immediately become engrossed.  Every passage is a gem.  It is dead-on social commentary and far closer to  the truth than any piece of non-fiction.
6304504012|5.0|Let me begin my saying I am not a Madonna fan. However, I am a HUGE theatre fan and have had the opportunity to see Evita on stage. To put it simply...the video is better. It is touching, easy to follow, and both  Madonna and Antonio hit the mark with ease. I saw the movie in the theatre  when it first came out and was delighted. Being a theatre fan, this past  birthday I asked my hubby to get me &quot;Cats&quot; and &quot;Evita&quot;  on tape so that I could enjoy them whenever I like. The fact that this many  years later I requested the video stands as a testament to the quality. See  for yourself...judge for yourself...I don't think you will be disappointed!
0671015206|1.0|&quot;How to be Cheap&quot; should be the title of this book.  This is another overrated book tapping into the wallets of middle America.  I suggest a review of the book firsthand before purchasing.  A more thorough  browse-through will expose the fact that this book is merely a product of a  limited survey done by the authors.  There is nothing new, creative or  innovative suggested by the authors--rather, it is common sense  &quot;how-to&quot;. If I had to recommend this book at all, then it would  be to young readers only, i.e. college or high-school graduates.
0783216084|5.0|the most awesome shark movie of it's time.can't wait to see deep blue sea to see how it matches up. the effects were great and I've never gone back in the water
0790739356|1.0|My one criteria for a bad movie: did I fall asleep?  Soldier bothered me so much, I had to turn off the VCR.  It was horrible.
0553278355|5.0|I read this book for the first time this summer, and after I had read it I wished that I had read it sooner. Everything she wrote made perfect sense to me and it made me think a lot about my life and where I was going and  the idea that I could be grossly underprepared for everything. If I have  ever wanted to write like anyone it would be Sylvia Plath. Her life is  tragic but it makes her work so much more compelling. Her novel helped  millions of people except her. I recommend it be read.
0800196341|5.0|Easily the best film of the year (96).  One of the best of the decade.  I would rate about one, sometimes two movies each year with five stars.  This one makes the cut just by making &quot;to be or not to be&quot; seem fresh.   No comparisons of Branagh to Olivier, please.  Olivier was a hack.   Really.  Check out his &quot;Hamlet&quot; if you have doubt in your heart.   Keaneu doesn't seem so bad afterward. Only complaint:  The extended fade  back shot before the intermission was admittedly a bit much.
6304539282|5.0|Star Wars is awsome!  It is way better than that sci-fi &quot;Star Trek&quot;.  Buy it!  I don't have it but you will love it.  I know I did when I watched it.
6305120706|5.0|Both the sound and the picture on this DVD is of the best quality. A definite good buy.
B00000HZTB|5.0|Yeah, yeah, _Berlin_ is great, powerful, harrowing, etc. But this has &quot;Waves of Fear&quot;.
B00000K0E5|5.0|This is the BEST Bond movie I have seen and i've seen them all.  This is a great movie and I am planing on buying it.  Pierce Brosnan is the best bond.  I recommend that you rent this or buy it.
B000002C1X|5.0|Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; is one of those landmark albums that comes around every ten to twenty years or so and catches the ear of all who experience it. Drasticly different from the band's previous work, most  notably because only two of it's four members contribute to the writing,  and also due to it's being their to date most stripped down, strait out  rock album. One could argue that it does have it's flaws, which indeed it  does. Much of the songs are short, seemingly added simply to tell &quot;The  Wall's&quot; complex story of mental anguish and psychological breakdown.  Obviously, shorter songs like &quot;Vera&quot;, &quot;The Show Must Go  On&quot; and &quot;Don't Leave me Now&quot; could have benifitted from the  musical direction of either keyboardist Richard Wright or not the least a  bit more flow from Guitarist David Gilmour.  But as it is, &quot;The  Wall&quot; is masterminded by it's innitial visionary, bassplayer Roger  Waters.  Significantly, this album would be his last truely great piece of  work, including his post-Pink Floyd albums. Waters was inspired to write  &quot;The Wall&quot; shortly after Pink Floyd's &quot;Animals&quot; world  tour, during wich he nursed a hatred for playing vast sports stadiums due  to (according to him) the souless connection between band and audience. But  as with any Pink Floyd album, the pros drastically outnumber the cons (if  indeed there are any). &quot;The Wall&quot; ultimately boasts some of Pink  Floyd's most popular and best loved songs. The ridiculously overplayed  &quot;Another Brick in the Wall pt. 2&quot;, the familiar acoustics of  &quot;Mother&quot; and some of Nick Mason's best drumming on &quot;In the  Flesh&quot;. David Gilmour's lone contributions give the album it's best  tracks in &quot;Run Like Hell&quot;, &quot;Young Lust&quot;, &quot;Hey  You&quot; and the ultimate Pink Floyd song, &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;  derived from an unused demo off of his previous year's solo album. The duet  vocals of Waters on verses and Gilmour on chorus to the latter song is  absolutley breathtaking. 'The Wall&quot; indeed is a wonderous exploration  of what a concept album can be, and I just try and imagine what an even  better work it could have become had it been a full band effort.
0316548189|4.0|Mr. Mandela's autobiography is especially insightful and intriguing if read alongside Mr. F.W. De Klerk's autobiography, because in this way the reader is given &quot;both sides&quot; of the story of the controversial  negotiations to end apartheid.  We find that even in the cruel world of  apartheid South Africa, humanity and decency was as strong as ever, even  among those who had nothing.<br />The only thing which left me wanting was an  adequate explanantion by Mr. Mandela as to how he made the emotional  transition from apathy and conformism to being a radical revolutionary.
B00000K2SE|5.0|The problem with most movies lately, particularly those that fall into the action genre, is that no matter how much good story telling there is, they just don't make you think.  The Matrix contains post apocalyptic  philosiphies and theories that do just that.  The complete shock of this  movie is that it could happen, it could be true; and there are certain  paradoxes to point to this, the famous Zeno's Paradox is one of them.  Also  something that we rarly see in action films of todays generation is strong  acting, something that The Matrix is full of.  Reeves drops the  &quot;California surfer dude&quot; act and is just plain great.  Fishburn  is at his best as Neo's teacher, providing insight into his life, and ours.   The thing I must applaud the Wachowski Brothers with the most however, is  that the special effects (which are out of this world) do not drown out the  plot or actors, as is the case with every other special FX flick of the  last few years.<br />This movie comes with the highest recommendation  possible.  It gets five stars because I couldn't give it six.
038532653X|4.0|The other reviewers do a good job of capturing the mystery and engaging nature of this book. The student from Shropshire, England is probably the only critique you need. However, I've had a few friends read it and they were somewhat repulsed by some of the graphic descriptions of the Skellig character, so I guess this isn't for everyone. It does have layers that make it more than a children's book, and engaging characters that make it a fun read. A cynic would choke on it, but if you are willing to read it as an allegory, and a study of the human heart, you will be swept away.
B000006OS2|1.0|This is from the VHS version that came in a blue box. It was not from the Wayne family who has the authorized version, which came out in VHS in a yellowish box. I believe this is from an old pan and scan version that this  company released before the authorized version. That is my membory of the  situation. That is probably the problem with the video transfer.
B000002UAC|5.0|This album shows the Fab Four at their rockin best.One of my favorite albums back in '64 was their 2nd album which featured Please Mister Postman,I'll Get You,Thank You Girl,etc.Most of those songs are here and  they still sound great. If you want good uplifting feel good music,their is  none better than this.Of course you can say that about all of their music  which lives on forever.
6300216039|5.0|This movie is brilliant in being so close to the real play in all detail, that I truly admire the devotion of its creators, who worked toward filming  Shakespeare, rather than using his name to present their personal  impulses. A true European film, and the music is an unforgettable  masterpiece.
B00000K2SC|5.0|This is one of the few movies I have ever seen, Where both the symbolism and the meanings behind them were different each of the 4 times I saw this movie. Never have I EVER been so energized about life after watching this  movie. Think of Neo as FDR. Think of Neo as Patton or Rommel. Think of Neo  as Jesus Christ. Every time a different story behind it. But the moral  remains clear: Always go through life with a second glance at things.  Always think about things at least two different ways before you appreciate  them. Remember Patch Adams? There's eight fingers, not four. <br />To sum up  the movie, let me just use a quote: &quot;There is no spoon.&quot;
1572522232|2.0|I'm sorry, But when I rented this i exspected this to be great and it isn't nearly good.  The acting is fine.,  the colors and the atmosphere are neat,  but the story wasn't very engaging.   In fact it seemed stupid and  the ending was really cut short and wasn't good either.  This film doesn't  hold a candle to Rosematy's baby,  halloween,  or Carrie.  Sorry,  but not  even close.
B00000K3G8|4.0|Talking Heads have revamped the soundtrack to possibly the best post modern concert rock film ever made. This is not you're older brothers soundtrack. In fact, die hard fans needn't worry. This Special Edition is  more in tune with the film. Better sound quality and different mixes appear  from the start like in &quot;Psycho Killer.&quot; Less drum machine and  more acoustic guitar. I love this version better than the original one I  grew up with because I think this Special Edition fully captures the  Talking Heads concert experience. I love the fact that I can finally jam to  the definitive version of &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; in my car. So, if  you want to feeling like burning down your house with a killer live show  than the Special Edition Stop Making Sense is the CD for you.
B000001GQB|5.0|Karl Bohm was truly a master interpreter of Mozart, and he had the best orchestra in Europe to complement his interpretive talents.  The 40th and the 41st &quot;Jupiter&quot; are easily the best recordings available, but  I was a bit disappointed with the lack of power in the 38th,  &quot;Prague&quot; (I prefer Leonard Bernstein's recording with the Vienna  Philharmonic for the 38th).  In general, I think Bohm's penchant for  playing Mozart symphonies at a slightly faster tempo than most conductors  is highly successful, and it is especially evident in the recording of the  40th.  First rate work.
B00000K19E|5.0|If you take this movie to heart, you can use it to help you see that this is IT.
B000002UA2|4.0|This is a great album , its not really pink floydish music but its great , in somo tracks you wouldnt know it was pink floyd except for waters voice , the instrumental songs are very good and catchy especially when youre in  and they actually rock in a few tracks like the gold its in the... a little  more commercial than the other floyd albums but  its cool anyway , my  favorites are childhoods end and wots uh the deal the other ones are  great too.
B000002OVJ|5.0|This recording is of The Who at their very best, and it' s live too.  For three weeks, this was the only CD that I listened to, because it is that good.
B000002KMV|4.0|While some songs on this album meander (&quot;Ronnie Talk to Russia&quot; and &quot;Let's Work&quot;), It's always funky.  The great cuts on this album outnumber the  surplusage:  &quot;Controversy,&quot;  &quot;Sexuality,&quot; &quot;Do Me Baby,&quot; &quot;Private Joy,&quot; and  &quot;Annie Christian.&quot;  It's  well-paced, danceable, and contains  some good social and political commentary.  A little bit of style and a  good chunk of funk substance go a long way, and Prince proved it with this  album.
B000002P2W|4.0|I love the Who, I have to admit, but Pete Townshend was obvioussly a little depressed and therefore the album turned out to have some very good stuff on it, and two bad songs.  I really can't complain.  Overall it is  good.
B000002L7R|3.0|While not as passionate or commanding as &quot;Purple Rain,&quot; this album made my status as a Prince fan permanent.  This album is made great by two songs: The awesome &quot;Raspberry Beret&quot; and the poignant  &quot;Pop Life.&quot;  There are also other good songs here:   &quot;America,&quot; &quot;Tambourine,&quot; and the Beautiful Ones-esque  &quot;Condition of the Heart.&quot;  I loved this album for its  adventurousness and its ambition.  For the most part, it does not  disappoint.  P.S.:  check out the &quot;Killer B&quot; b-sides that came  wth the singles from this album:  &quot;She's Always in My Hair,&quot;  &quot;Hello,&quot; and &quot;Girl.&quot;
6303461484|5.0|THIS  MOVIE  DEALS  WITH  SESITIVE  MATERIAL. IT IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART.BUT,IT IS ONE OF THE MOST GRIPPING MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN.
B000002KY8|5.0|1999 is either praised as 1) a seminal piece of funk-rock (no pun intended) or 2) a great lead-up to the monster &quot;Purple Rain.&quot;  It's both.  Yes, it's filled with undeniably classic grooves, including the  title track and &quot;Little Red Corvette.&quot;  But this album is built  on a broad foundation of great cuts that are the forbears of Purple Rain.   Listen to &quot;Automatic&quot; and you hear shades of &quot;Computer  Blue.&quot;  Check out &quot;Something in the Water&quot; and you hear  faint echoes of &quot;The Beautiful Ones.&quot;  Other cuts are simply  outstanding:  &quot;Lady Cab Driver,&quot; &quot;DMSR,&quot; and of course,  &quot;International Lover.&quot;  If you don't have this album, you should.   It is among the greatest albums in a era of great ones.
6305282927|5.0|I thought that this musical had Great songs in it and some of the greatest actors of all time. I watch this film over and over again. I recommend this film to everyone.
B000006OAM|5.0|her music absolutly rocks, on the disk and in concert.  It's been a while sense I was in high school so the bubble-gum pop music is out, I'm burned out on &quot;the oldies&quot; and I'm damn glad natalie is making some  rockin new music!!!

0380778556|5.0|I first read this book when I was 13 for a book report in language arts.  I thought, you know, what the heck, it's a mystery romance sort of thing and I'm a sucker for love.  From the very first sentence, to the very last,  I could not take my eyes off the page!  It's a wonderful wonderful book  that completely captures you.  You'll hate Ms.Danvers, love the second Mrs.  DeWinter and sympathize with her, and you'll feel sorry for Max.  It's one  of the best books ever!  It's filled with suspense, fear, mystery,  EVERYTHING you could ever hope for.
6305308659|3.0|Pleasantville has a good script, but is loaded with Hollywood values and self-righteous &quot;truths&quot;.   The main premise seems to be that a moral life must be &quot;colorless&quot; and empty of joy.  And, of course,  all religious people are mean-spirited thugs. Just once, I'd like to see a  big studio movie where a person with a relationship to Christ actually  practices what Christ preached! I might have a long wait for that. Parents  beware!
0767819543|5.0|5 stars is not enough to classified this great film! With a great direction, by Walter Salles, great cinematography, wonderful original score, divine screenplay and the best role played by Fernanda Montenegro,  the biggest actress in Brazil, this film was simply made with heart to  those who have hearts!  For me, THE BEST FILM OF 90's!!! There's no other  that has the quality and the Beauty of this! I'm proud of being brazilian,  watching this film! It shows my country like it realy is, with lots of  problem, but with people touched by heart! Thank you Walter for a  marvellous work! And Fernanda Montenegro, the Oscar doesn't deserve your  magnitude! You're the best in 1998 for sure!
630471288X|5.0|An apparent linear story surprises with a twist ending that takes a great movie and improves upon perfection. A joy to behold.  I put only Casablanca and Contact in this category.  (I hope  they didn't err and choose not to  enhance for widescreen.  That would be a terrible mistake... see Titanic.)
0374172897|5.0|This is a book in which each sentence can be savored and mulled over. After finishing The Hours, I immediately reread it, which I've never done before, and discovered new joys in the writing. The detail is so complete  and lyrical, and I'm usually a reader who skips over detailed descriptions  to get back to the plot. The narrative flows easily and gently propels the  reader, but every word demands your complete attention. The way Cunningham  inhabits the minds of his three female protagonists is awe-inspiring and  thoroughly convincing, at least to this male reader. There are moments and  characters' thoughts that ring staggeringly true. Cunningham imparts much  power in a simple sentence, &quot;It is enough.&quot; I don't know if that  is from the original &quot;Mrs. Dalloway.&quot; I am compelled now to read  Woolf's book and I want to read everything I can about The Hours. How I  long for a discussion group! I was impressed by The Hours from the start,  then mid-way through reading it, I happened to catch the Vanessa Redgrave  movie of Mrs. Dalloway on TV, which increased my enjoyment exponentially.  This book is definitely haunting me.
0553278223|5.0|I.People come to Bradbury in different ways:<br />a. they are assigned to read this book (or Dandelion Wine or Fahreheit 451)for school,<br />b. it's on a summer reading list,<br />c. you heard he was good sci-fi writer and  influenced Stephen King (yes, that's true)<br />d. and is with the greats such  as Poe and Vonnegut and etc;<br />e. or you just happened upon it the way  Bastian Bux happens upon the Neverending Story in the book of that same  name: while you love entertainment, you love also, meaning - unlike those  who chased Bastian in the trash bin in the movie version.<br />1. I notice  this is how it is with much of literature,<br />2.therefore that would include  Bradbury.<br />II. Truly in response to many questions and almost epithetical  statements made by some reviewers,:<br />A. the book was first published in  1946.<br />B. We hadn't even been to the moon yet. <br />1.A movie, &quot;The  Mouse in The Moon&quot; with Peter Sellers shows just how far off people  were in exact science, even right b4 the moon.<br />2. So some say, of  Bradbury and other such sci-fi <br />a.&quot;They were completely inaccurate,  unrealistic, Bradbury didn't finish college and therefore, he and they are  now obsolete.&quot; <br />b.Some even claim Bradbury is not  sci-fi.<br />1.Firstly, Bradbury was completely realistic  in depicting human  relationships in going by humanity's past actions yes, the colonizations  and etc;).<br />2. Some are jealous at hearing he may not have finished  college. He actually wrote Fahrenheit when he was only 19.<br />3. I have gone  to college.<br />4.Alot of successful writers haven't gone to college.<br />5. On  the other hand, people also once read books more, people like  Bradbury,people like Jack London. Stephen King hated creative writing in  college.<br />a.there are plenty of smart, intellectual people who are elitist  and like to think themselves better than everyone else, <br />b. thus showing  their own low self-esteem and worry about their own success. <br />6.A similar  premise of not going to college and being a successful writer isn't  possible for a certain alliterate part of the population who actually have  three tvs (like in Fahrenheit 451) in the wall at a time, or more. <br />a.We  see such usage of tvs even in the mall. <br />b.It's happening now.<br />C. As  for the book not being sci-fi,<br />1. &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; is  sci-fi,<br />2. simply because it involves a scientific fiction.<br />III. What  Bradbury has written is literature that will endure as long as this world  is around <br />A.because the social issues he described are all very possible  and have happened. <br />B. He uses literary and myth references in all his  work, and references to actual history.<br />C.That, people, is what makes  literature.<br />1. For instance, During Jane Austen and Charlotte  Bronte's  time, there were popular authors who wrote supernatural and action packed  thrillers, like today. <br />2.No one but English Professors or specialists  know who they are.<br />3. It is similar with Shakespeare, and also, with  Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman.<br />4. There were those popular during  their day but what they wrote did not transcend to a spiritual, meaningful  level; <br />a.it was more of what you might call greeting  card doggerel,  which serves a purpose,<br />b. but it does not at all transcend the time to  reach a larger human consciousness. <br />c.That is what the sort of writing  Bradbury does is all about--<br />d. he takes the elusive, everyday mundane  and turns it into an event which transcends time and place.<br />e. He thereby  transcends genre, which the other writers previously mentioned also  did.<br />IV. A human being, esp. a writer conscious of meaning is able to  discern the link to the past, the present and the future so that they all  become one and the same.<br />A. Especially by the way the stories are  intricately woven together,<br />B. in the samesort of way that when we pick  up a news paper, we know what happened may have been at a different place  on the other side of the world, or time,<br />C. but we know we are still part  of the same world it took place in.<br />D. He also links many of his stories  to other stories in other books he's written -- check Balzac, Faulkner etc;   Excuse me, I must thank you for giving me something to publish an essay on  for myself now!
B00000FYPB|3.0|Don't listen to anyone who says the film is too slow.  The slow pace of the film captures the leisurely feel of 18th-century settings just as the slowness of 2001 captures the eeriness of space and prehistory.  Don't  listen to anyone who says the film is too cold.  Great passion lies just  beneath that icy surface, and it sometimes breaks out with great drama.   Don't listen to anyone who says that the film is highly regarded only  because of the director's name.  The film contains real brilliance.  The  final duelling scene deserves to be a cinematic classic, the choice of  music and its synchronicity with the action is sometimes almost  unbelievable -- not to mention perfect acting and stunning visuals.  The  characters are richly drawn.  Near the end of the film I am drawn into  identifying with both Barry and his estranged stepson.  This makes the  final duelling scene all the more tragic.           Well, then is there  anything wrong with this film?  Unfortunately, there is.  Barry Lyndon is  painted on a canvas of epic scale, but the subject matter is the rather  dreary life of an Irishman who made it big despite modest origins only to  fall into obscurity.  In other words, the epic proportions of the film do  not fit the modest subject matter.  If only Kubrick had stayed with his  original intention of making a film about Napoleon -- then we might have  had here the greatest film ever made!  At the very least, we would have had  another epic to place alongside Spartacus and 2001.  Nonetheless, the  brilliance in this film is real, and it is well worth repeated viewing.    **  The above is what I wrote about this film several years ago.  I have a higher opinion of it now.  The film operates at a very subtle level, and it requires the viewer to rise up to that level to appreciate it right.  But I won't change the number of stars, because Amazon's silly star system means nothing anyway.  For a very interesting review of this film, see [...]/movies/b/barrylyndon.html
0671578278|5.0|Miles has met Ekaterin earlier, in \\"Komarr\\", and is now madly in love with her.  Unfortunately, she is still recovering from her marriage and has wrapped herself in her widowhood to avoid courtship.  So he has to court her in secret... without her realizing it!  VERY funny, well-written book with Barrayaran politics and not many explosions.  It would help if you've read previous Vorkosigan books before this one, but you might enjoy it even if you haven't read What Has Gone Before.
6305265666|5.0|Absolutely wonderful from beginning to end - a masterful and beautifully captured story which will be a favourite for years. I hadn't seen the film when I purchased the DVD, but many of my friends reccommended it, and as  soon as the menu appeared on my screen, I knew I would love it.  The disc  is otherwise fairly bare-bones in terms of features, although the sound and  picture quality is perfect, as is the film itself.
0790735172|5.0|Everybody already knows how great Lee was so I won't even get into that aspect of the film,but what really impressed me was the acting of the whole cast.John Saxon did a great job displaying both his humerous side and his  serious side.Jim Kelly was great in his role,and the guy who played Han  really personified evil.Bob Wall always did well playing the bad guy,but  how many times is he going to get kicked in the groin everytime he's in a  Lee movie?
0767824571|5.0|I don't care what this yutz says, this was the first Monty Python movie I ever saw, and let me tell you I thought it was hilarious.  For fans only?  I think NOT.
B00000K3G8|5.0|It amazes me that this recording is 16 years old. The sound on this newly remastered and expanded edition boggles my mind. The sound is so clear and full it sounds as if you are on stage with the band. The performaces are  stellar as well. A true watermark in the career of the Talking Heads as  well as for live albums in general. A classic.
B000002KNU|5.0|Talking Heads '77 is definitely the best Talking Heads album.  You can hear the punk roots with a David Byrne twist (of course).  Any fan of rock and roll needs this album.  Pulled Up is the best Talking Heads song ever  made and every track is awesome!  there isn't a bad song on this album.   this album will show you what rock and roll is all about!!!
B000002UB3|5.0|Undoubtedly infinitely arguable as to whether everyone will agree with that statement, but this album is too good, it leaves you stunned after the first play, wishing it was not over, wanting more. Rock and roll was never  the same after this. It is timeless. If you love great rock and roll, you  will love Abbey Road.
B00000K3G8|5.0|Stop Making Sense is arguably the best live album ever produced.  David Byrne is the world's most creative music with a knack for the extraordinary.  He puts on a wicked show and this CD shows why.  Every  track just booms from the speakers.  BUY IT!!
B00000IPAX|5.0|Ilove this CD. There are no bad songs on it. My favorite is song #8. I thing everyone should have it.
B00000373U|5.0|Could I give this 6 stars? The first time I heard &quot;Either/Or&quot; I begged my friend to feed it to me in small, 2-3 song doses because its brilliance was almost too much to bear. Hyperbole? Call it what you  will--that's what happened. Elliott's other albums are all great and should  be in any pop music fan's collection, but this one-well, it's a miracle.  &quot;Alameda&quot; is felt all the way into the pit of one's stomach.  &quot;Big Nothing&quot; is uplifting sounding, yet its lyrics are crushing.  I could go on and on about each track, but suffice to say they're all  awe-inspiring. I see this album being as revered in the future as Nick  Drake's &quot;Pink Moon&quot; or &quot;Tonight's the Night&quot; by Neil  Young. It will never be forgotten, at least by me.
6300248550|4.0|I saw this movie while in high school just after having read Jane Eyre.  It is a great movie and I think it is worth watching over and over and over!!  Timithay Dalton is just wonderfull as Mr. Rodchester, the best  actor I have ever seen play the role.  If you like Jane Eyre this is a must  have!
0792156684|5.0|James Cameroon's &quot;Titanic&quot; is definitely one of my favorite movie.  DVD version provide you better sound and video quality.  Absolutely value for money!
B000000W5L|5.0|Exile is an example of grace under pressure and it reflects the circumstances under which it was recorded.It is at once, evocative of a time when rockandroll was still dangerous and yet is still totally  timeless. Mick Jagger would never again be as unself-conscious as he is  here and the band would never again sound as loose and exciting as they do  on this record. The Stones could still make music as good as this if they  could just unshackle themselves from the business of &quot;being&quot; THE  ROLLING STONES and just be a great,great rockandroll band - as they once  were. The Stripped set from a few years back, showed that they were still  capable of capturing that intensity and rawness. They could go back to  making albums in the same fashion and still be a commercial force. They are  after all, THE ROLLING STONES- they don't need to &quot;compete&quot; any  more. How many bands in this day and age, could make an album that covers  soul, gospel, dirty rockandroll,country and delta blues and still stamp  their personality on it. I doubt many major labels would allow such  freedom. It would be considered commercial suicide.  The Stones, however  could do this and gracefully maintain the level of respect that albums like  Exile On Main Street has earnt them.
0790740443|1.0|Down below you 'll see the commentery of my comerade Tevfik with whom we 've seen this movie together. He already talked about how funny it was to see a very bad movie.I consider this movie as the worst i 've ever seen in  my life . The movie doesnt mean any thing and it doesnt have any good  points. Some movies have good points and bad points , you can say the  script was very bad but special fx saved the day. But it is not like this  at Soldier. You can see better sepecial effects while playing Atari version  of Moonpatrol.I generally like Russle's acting but in that movie there was  nothing to act i think Kurt was unnecessery for the movie a good crafted  wood would do the trick.I hope they stop making that bad movies ... And i  cannot finish without prpmpting my best regards to Ed Wood . He was a great  man . Thanks to him for inspiring the producers of that film.
6305358567|5.0|perhaps one of the best movies ever made. cate blanchett gives a stunning and brilliant performance as queen elizabeth. &quot;elizabeth&quot;, being somewhat darker and dealing with more serious matter, is not a  happy-go-lucky film as, for example, &quot;shakespeare in love&quot;. but  these aspects of the film make it even more exciting and certainly worth  the oscar nomination. also, magnificent performances from joseph fiennes,  geoffrey rush, and christopher eccleston.
0871137380|5.0|I don't know if it is the skill of the writer or the intensity of the subject matter, but I found it difficult to put the book down. If this were to be made into a movie, it would make a ton of money.<br />Interestingly, we  now know that the same Delta Force operatives in Somalia were, at that  time, blabbing that about a dozen of their number participated in the final  assault of the Branch Davidian church in Waco, several months before,  resulting in the deaths of 80 people including 22 children. The use of  Armed Services troops is a violation of federal law. (go to video section  and check out &quot;Waco: The Rules of Engagement.&quot;
0316518565|4.0|A great summer read.  I (and probably most other readers) would have benefitted from a somewhat clearer and simpler explanation of the complicated financial transactions, however.
068484267X|4.0|Entertaining and lively...but the end was anti-climactic. The last 10% of the book felt out of place, didn't seem like the same writer and seems to be an ackward transition into a sequel...which I found out is in the works.
B000005ITX|5.0|Forever Changes is the perfect marriage of orchestral pop with punk rock attitude. My pick would have to be YOU SET THE SCENE which seamlessly flows through it's sections and builds to an uplifting, brass driven  crescendo.Everything on the album builds up to this song. Other classics  such as ALONE AGAIN OR, A HOUSE IS NOT A MOTEL and LIVE AND LET LIVE  possess a thrilling undercurrent of menace which I find utterly compelling.  I urge anyone interested in the art of songwriting to check out FOREVER  CHANGES and learn something from it's mixture of beauty and pain. Some  tunes have dated terribly(OLD MAN) but even these possess a period charm. I  LOVE this record!!!!
0425170349|5.0|I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN<br />READ IT RIGHT AFTER 'THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY' ANOTHER WINNER, BYT HE WAY, AND CONSIDER IT CLANCY'S BEST BOOK SINCE THE SUM OF ALL FEARS<br />READ IT, AND ALSO TRY 'CUBA' AND 'ENDER'S SHADOW'.
6302886228|5.0|the fox singing backup is none other than Sheryl Crow
B000002J1C|5.0|YES-THE YES ALBUM:This album,their third,is in my opinion the harbinger of two significant changes for the band. Firstly Steve Howe comes in to replace Peter Banks on guitars and secondly this is their first truely  progressive album. The work features six tracks,including four lengthy  pieces in which the band fuse extended,absorbing improvisation with  engaging counterpoint that gives the arrangements a fluid complexity far  exceeding that in their previous work. There are also two shorter tracks  one of which is a superb instrumental by Steve Howe whose artistic  musicianship brings an added dimension to the band. Chris Squire is again  outstanding with his rhythmic,resonating bass work combining with both Bill  Bruford's tight,proficient,jazz percussion style and Tony Kaye's  forging,stolid keyboard style to lay down a matrix through which Jon  Anderson's celestial like vocals and the lush YES harmonies permeate and  disseminate. The lyric base,although esoteric,is both fascinating and  inspiring which seem to me to focus around deconstucting our  narrow,insular,egocentric disposition and reintergrating human experience  and spirituality with the cadence of our world and universe. This blend of  eddifying lyrics and vivid arrangements makes for an impressive entrance  into the progressive arena and although this album is perhaps not as  involved and demanding as some of their later work,the more accessible  slant to this album gives it a charm of its own. For those of you new to  the progressive rock smorgasboard this is an excellent album to acquire the  taste with.  Rod.
B00000IBRX|1.0|The story is phony.  The writing is horrible.  Robin Williams is simpering and downright embarrassing.  The philosophy is sophomoric, at best.  The only thing going for this movie is in the special effects department.  And  it proves that special effects do not a movie make.
0399143904|4.0|On second reading, about a year after the first reading, I am much more impressed with RAINBOW SIX.  Perhaps the 4 or 5 novels by Clancy-wanna-be authors I've read in the meantime have effected my perspective.  Simply  put, no-one comes close to Clancy in this narrow action genre.  RAINBOW SIX  may not be quite the equivalent of WITHOUT REMORSE or EXECUTIVE ORDERS, but  it is miles ahead of anything written by the copy-cats.  In RAINBOW SIX  Clancy added a new element, a  mysterious conspiracy.  The action sequences  alternate with the unveiling of the mystery.  Unfortunately, much of the  mystery plot is implausible.  Readers thus rush through the action and  character-development sequences, not fully appreciating them, to get to the  mystery sequences, which are ultimately unsatisfying.  As a result, readers  are disappointed with the entire experience.  The action sequences and  character development, are good by Clancy standards, terrific by comparison  with anything else in the genre.<br /><br />As to plausibility, as one of the  creators of the very first Earth Day, I do not find the fanatic  environmentalists in any way implausible.  I've known such people,  intimately.  The science too, is perfectly plausible.  It is other,  relatively irrelevant, plot elements which are implausible.
6304080921|5.0|Once you resign youself to the fact that time travel ultimately nullifies the true possibility of this film, &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; is a superb techno-thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  For several  hours after the fact, you will easily find yourself poring over the plot,  and desperate to watch it again to see what subtle cues you may have missed  the first time.  The ending of the movie makes the whole story worthwhile.
B00000DLVA|3.0|Okay this cd was  good but the only word that I can think of to summarize it is morbid. The songs are defenitly depressiing and have a melancholy feel to them. Also, after listening to this CD for a while the songs became  bland ( the later tracks of the CD that is ). To be honest I prefer to  listen to the more upbeat songs on their previous albums like &quot;  carnival &quot; from their album life and &quot; lovefool &quot; from their  album First Band on the Moon. I mean I became a fan or their music because  I admired their  unique upbeat music style. Gran Turismo was kind of a  shick to me.
0812589041|5.0|With over 800 reviews (avg. score of 4.5 stars), the reviews are probably longer than the book!  Are _all_ of those people wrong?  This is simply the best book of our century.  <br />However, an adult can't rush through this  with the idea of analyzing it.  It has to be read by a kid, or at least in  the spirit of a kid.  This is a book that you want to set down every 10  pages and wonder, &quot;Wow, what would I do in his shoes?&quot;  You have  to have thought of yourself, at least at one point in your life, as a  brilliant outcast.  <br />Everyone I know who has read this book, whether they  were a child or an adult when they read it, whether they are accountants;  students; computer programmers; or truck drivers, loves this book.  Many,  like me, have read it lots of times (as in double digit).<br />There are so  many things to say about it, despite being 20 years old, the computer and  Internet technolgy are right on.  The characters are so real.  The stakes  are so high.  The pace is so fast.<br />Buy this book now.  How can 800 people  be wrong?
B000002P5R|2.0|Ok, so Jimi had a grand musical vision of a new style and direction. Nothing wrong with that. This can be a good sign, but not always. In my opinion, First Rays is unimpressive and over-hyped. Anyway, what stood out  upon first listen was a sort of funkier and more homogenous quality to the  songs, compared to much of his earlier material. Unfortunately, the music  sounds UNINSPIRED AND EXTREMELY RUSHED. Out of the seventeen tracks, only  two really stand out to any degree; the melodic ballad &quot;Angel&quot;  and the powerful &quot;Hey Baby(New Rising Sun)&quot;. Yet something is  missing from even these two songs that I can't quite put my finger on. I  don't really think the &quot;unfinished&quot; aspect of First Rays is the  main problem with it. Perhaps something else was dominating Hendrix's mind  during the sessions other than his music.(Not necessarily drugs either).
0684874350|5.0|The human race stands before us in McCourt's memoir of abject poverty, disease(and God bless 'im), dreams, desires and a sense of humor.  It's grand and gorgeous: no preachiness, no gags, no sympathy vote, no  pretentious shock value.  It is a pure and true book, and its tone matches  in perfect beat as absurdity rules little Frankie's life.  Yes, folks,  there are some extreme and horrible realities for the family in this book,  but then again, this is planet earth.  It is sorrowful and bleak.  It is  also a memorial, with McCourt's pint raised, to all those who believed,  endured and/or lost. And if you don't believe it, you're an  &quot;eejit&quot;.
0792833279|5.0|To the viewer from Dorchester, NJ. You obvious don't know anything about movies. This movie rules.
B00000DHRX|5.0|This compilation of greatest hits is by far one of the best ever.  I especially liked the format; disc one, all slow jams and the other, pure dance. This collection is a must have.
B000002LIX|5.0|I'm skeptical of any rock song that's longer than 3 minutes.  However, Three Days is an exception to that general rule.  The driving bass pulls you through an 11 minute fury of sound that leaves you begging for more.   And Classic Girl?  What a way to finish an album.  This is Jane's finest  moment.
B000002U82|5.0|The cremme da la cremme of music, these songs never get old, &quot;Time&quot; is a killer song with its harmonys and blistering guitar solo by David Gilmour, &quot;Money&quot; is a classic,from the coins  clinking in the drawer to the last note. Dont let this CD not be in your  collection.
0380973464|5.0|This book rivals Snow Crash in its grip.  I found myself totally obsessed with Crytonomicon and every one of its characters.  I love the way Neal Stephenson tells a story.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|Offspring is the best band ever and all five of thier albums are the best music ever created.

B000002C1X|5.0|The Wall is the Opus of the inventors of three dimentional sound.  Every previous album starting from the days of Syd Barrett (including DSOTM, brilliant as they were)was a rehersal for the liquid elegance of this  album.  If it was just the music, Pink Floyd is still just a band(one of a  kind but...)but they've also 'lyricized' the stuff for which people have  won Nobel prizes in literature(see &quot;Free Fall&quot; by William Golding  then listen to the Wall... and then listen to yourself).   There isnt a  song as such in The Wall, it all hangs together in a wonderful,  ecstatically tight and yet melancholly kind of way.  And all this is still  alive after twenty years; how many albums can boast of that?
6303617719|5.0|Here's another time when I disagree with the critics.  This movie may end up a little sappy and predictable, but I really enjoyed it. It's one of those movies you can watch again and again.
B000000132|5.0|Renaissance managed to blend progressive with folk and classical, the result a unique blend that will send shivers up your spine if you ever saw them in concert. A real shame they were never fully appreciated my side of  the Atlantic, in their homeland. Their music is still as fresh today as it  was in my student days and I am delighted to be able to listen to it again  on CD. Mother Russia is a classic.
630242335X|3.0|I found this video to be very adequate for my needs. It was fun and showed how ruthless Klingons really are (NO OFFENCE WORF!)
0671578278|5.0|Okay, I said that about Komarr, too. It just keeps getting better. <br />The Vorkosigan books started out as fine space opera, and they've continued being excellent stories while the author's use of the language has improved  even beyond the best subtlety of Jane Austen. The dialogue is fantastic.  What else can I say? It's worth the read no matter who you are.<br />Drop  everything and read this whole series immediately.
B000007NYS|5.0|Earthy, lyrical and able to withstand many repeated playings. If you're a Lucinda Williams fan to any extent you're sure to love this work; if you don't already know Lucinda's music, you're in for a real treat. This is  great road-trip music and also wonderful all-by-yourself-late-night music.  I love this album. Do yourself a favor and give it a listen.
6304806434|3.0|I had the director wrong, it's not Brian De Palma it's Simon West.  My comments still hold though.
B000006NPY|5.0|I see many comments refering to this album as an electronica album, it is not.  This is a folk album people.  Yes, there are synths and drum loops, but the songs are all, with the exception of a few, folk songs.  I for one  appreciate Billy and the gang breaking away from their stadium rock sound,  I love all the S.P albums, but there comes a time when artists stop being  creative, and start being repetitive.  I got a chance to see their free  outdoor concert in Minneapolis, and it blew me away.  They played most of  Adore, but with different arrangements, and it was great.  The only thing  that sucked about it though was all the blockheads who just have to mosh,  even during a ballad, come on people if all you want to do is run into  people crank up the stereo at home and get some miller and a few friends.   The mood of the album is one of serenity, quiet, and darkness.  It won't  send you into a head-banging rage, but it is still a Smashing Pumpkins  album.  If you like the Pumpkings, not just a few of their songs but if you  really like them, you'll like this c.d.
6302775302|5.0|Dire Straits (aka Mark Knopfler) at the height of their/his power and professional polish and brilliant performances.   It's uncanny that live performances can be so polished (if you believe their 'no overdub rule' -  which I do).   It seems that whether in the studio or on stage they create  magic and weave stories that draw you into them with an emotionalism that  is uncanny.  The upper songs make you happy and the sad songs can bring  tears to your eyes.  M.K. performs the songs with an intensity that belies  the fact that he's done them 1000 times.  I'm a new fan and I've bought all  their videos (from Amazon) and I love them all.
0688170528|5.0|I could not put this book down. A friend gave it to me to read and once I opened to the first page, I was not focused until it was finished. It really moved me to think about life and friendships, the relationships we  have, and how events can forever alter that perception. It also shows you  the way different people react to similar information. I loved this book  and will read whatever the author produces in the future.
6302158249|5.0|This video is during the height of their youth and enthusiasm.  Some of Mark Knopfler's vocals are uneven but his guitar work is magnificant as is the work of the other musicians.  For sheer fun  and exuberence this video  is worth the price of &quot;admission&quot;.     Another must for Dire  Straits fans.  All their hits up to 1983 when the video was made.  Buy  it... you won't regret it.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix extends the theme used in Terminator, where the machines have taken over the world, however with a twist. We now live as human batteries to feed the machine... life as we know it is a mere virtual reality  game.<br />A lot of work went into this movie from both special effects, which  are stunning, to the conditioning of the actors. <br />The only thing I fear  is a Matrix 2... not that that would be bad... but hollywood has a habit of  messing up the sequels... A must see at least 5 times.
1878424319|5.0|This short book is written simply but with great truth.  Ruiz gives four principles to direct one to become free from a negative lifestyle and negative thought.  The concepts are couched in Toltec beliefs and can be  adapted by anyone in any situation.  Inspiring.
0060920084|1.0|This book is a completely uninteresting description of one mans travels through North America.  Boring and self-serving, Bryson fails in his attempt to relive his childhood journeys.
6302859204|5.0|I was lucky enough to catch this at the theaters before it went to video.  It was out for weeks, and was on it's last week when I saw it.  I must say, the movie was awesome.  Not only was the movie good and frightening alone,  but the taqline states &quot;based on the true story&quot;, suggesting the  possibilities that everything you will witness may have actually happened!   What truly gives the film it's meat is the sequence inside the alien  spacecraft.  Although the events inside the ship were changed from what the  real Travis Walton said had happened, the scene succeeded in as Travis put  it, &quot;conveying&quot; his feelings to the audience.  I could watch that  scene a million times, and still never be able to figure out how they did  it.  There were no fake CGI effects, and that honestly made it much more  realistic and believable.  &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; is not a  masterpiece, but it was well done, and the alien sequence stands out as one  of the best pieces of film history!  I was a little disappointed with the  video though.  It's not letterboxed, and it's improperly framed.  I  remembered vividly what it looked like in theaters, so watching this  modified version seemed like a totally different movie to me.  Thankfully I  got the widescreen laserdisc, which brought back memories of what the film  looked like on the big screen.  They should press some widescreen copies of  this on tape, or better yet, DVD!  That would rule if this came out on DVD!
6301972015|5.0|I adore this movie - it's one of a very few that I could watch over and over and over again, and still enjoy. The entire cast is superb, and the script if witty and intelligent. A delightfully funny movie.  Watch it and  you'll love it.
0380973464|5.0|This book by Neal Stephenson is very unlike his other works.<br />It is unlike his first book, _The Big U_, which is a fun fictional  telling of outragious college life. (Try and find that in print!)<br />It is unlike _Snow  Crash_, his first foray into Cyber Punk.<br />It is unlike _The Diamond Age_,  science fiction nanotech meets social evolution.<br />Don't know about  _Zodiac_ because I haven't read it yet.<br />This book is a WW2 Historical  Fiction meets current day Internet business. It has very colorful  characters in crazy but just on the edge of believable adventures. So,  throw away any expectations of the author from previous works. I have  renewed respect for the author's skill at doing well in new genre. (Unlike  some authors who keep turning out the same type of crap over and over  again.)<br />There are some editorial errors in grammar that a professional  editor should be embarrassed to have been paid for. <br />But overall, very  entertaining!
6305066345|4.0|Great movie with great acting by Denzel Washington &amp; Ray Allen
B000002MG1|5.0|Great CD, from Drive, to Everbody hurts, to Man on the Moon, to Nightswimming. This CD has something for everyone. Whether in love or crushed the CD is great
0671578278|5.0|I really enjoyed A Civil Campaign!  A funny, moving story.  I thought the beginning was a little slow -- in fact, when I read the preview chapters, I was prepared for a disappointing read. (A personal peeve of mine is people  who write reviews when they haven't read the whole book!)  But when I read  the whole book, it all came together into a great story. Amazon provided  great service in getting me this book before it was available in any of my  local bookstores.   One of her best!
0783225849|5.0|Simply put, Psycho is the mold that every other slasher movie has in order to achieve horror...Before Psycho there was nothing...no other horror movie ever had a knife wielding maniac...no other movie before dared to kill off the star just 40 minutes into the movie...Hitchcock was the  master...HE created the molds that others copy in order to get the chills  from the audience...Those who don't like his movie, are simply people who  don't understand that everything has a beginning....If there never was a  Hitchcock, there never would've been a &quot;Halloween&quot;, or  &quot;Scream&quot;...This movie is a huge part of cinema history...to say  the movie is dated, would be like saying Elvis Presley music is no good  because it's old...without Elvis there would be no rock music today as we  know it...Without Hitch there would be no horror today as we know  it...Everything has its origins, those who can appreciate it will know the  value that Psycho had to modern horror cinema...and REAL horror fans don't  look at Psycho as &quot;good for its time&quot; but rather &quot;Great  compared to what we have today!&quot;
B000002UAR|5.0|I will never understand the clamoring for &quot;Sergeant Pepper&quot;.  It was a great album, sure, but THIS, in my opinion, is their absolute best (and therefore one of the best pop albums ever.)  Made in the period just  after the Beatles began to move beyond their 2-minute Merseybeat songs and  right before Yoko Ono's influence on John started, this is the perfect  Beatles compilation--plenty of catchy, cynical tunes (&quot;Taxman&quot;)  and the promise of great things to come (&quot;Tomorrow Never  Knows&quot;--the best Beatles song ever recorded.)
6300214559|5.0|While I will agree with anyone that this movie's makers were less than true to history regarding the relationship of Jane and Guilford, I think they did an incredible job otherwise of re-creating the 15th century, the  series of heartbreaking ironies that put Jane on the throne, and most of  all, the personality of Lady Jane Grey.  This movie inspired me to study  and learn more about her tragic life, such as the fact that she is listed  in Foxe's Book of Martyrs for her choice of death over recanting her  beliefs.  A sweeping epic, beautifully subtle and detailed, and  heartwrenchingly sad.
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie is based on Plato's Cave Allegory.  If you are unfamiliar with the concept, READ IT.  I have seen it 6 times in the theatre and ordered it on DVD.  It now holds the top 3 places in my all time favorites.<br />See it  and judge for yourself.  If you get it, you WILL love it, if you dont, I am  sorry.
6304077955|5.0|&quot;When I say everbody says so,&quot; I mean I say so. An original and unusual movie, not likely or intended to become a classic or start a trend. Still, getting this intense movie filled with sharp dialogue, over-the-top  characters, and a nihilistic point-of-view beyond the idea stage is a  miracle. In a marketplace where the most ambitious goal is to make as much  money as possible as safely as possible by appealing to the lowest common  denominator, a movie like &quot;Naked&quot; is true to its title.
0790729725|3.0|OK, like anyone else I enjoy a good ganster movie...but why ALL the gore, blood and violence?  I think &quot;martin&quot; over did it just a bit.  It was a little too much for my to stomache.  But all-in- all it was a well  done film with GREAT DIALOGE.
6305603847|5.0|This movie rule's but it's about time they put it on DVD Pink Floyd is great and this movie shows just how smart they were.
0783227019|5.0|Pacino is one of the greatest actors that ever graced the &quot;silver screen&quot; and in this movie you get a true scence of why he is the best.  This film touched me.  It gives the viewer the harsh reality of what it is  the make a fresh start after being in prison and its also a beautiful love  story.  I really liked this movie.  One of my favorites
0783225792|4.0|Hey...did anyone notice what a great job sharon stone did?  Pesci, Dinero and the rest of them are always great but thumbs up to Stone!  Pretty good movie...I liked this one.  See it if you have about 3 hours on hand.
6305470448|5.0|Impressive acting by Paltrow and &quot;the guy who played Shakespeare&quot; unfortunatly I do not know his name.  I just watched this movie over the weekend and I must say I loved it!  I can clearly see why it  got the awards it recieved.  The set and costumes were magnificent, had a  wonderful plot and I love the ending &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; scene. I  got a real feel of the shakespearean theater during this film.   GREAT  GREAT GREAT.  This film made me smile.  :)
B000002J09|5.0|I have a degree in music, I've toured with classical ensembles in America and Europe, and I STILL listen to Zeppelin.  This album is one of their best, surpassed only by Physical Graffiti perhaps (in my opinion).  More  opinions-&gt; You'd have to be on a lot of medication to think that the  boring meanderings of groups like Floyd could ever surpass Zeppelin in  melodic development, song arrangement, or instrumental virtuosity.  Led  Zeppelin is far more innovative/progressive, colorful, and exciting than  almost anyone else of their time and ours. Why do I still listen to them?   Because their music takes me somewhere exotic and it moves me in a positive  way.  Floyd makes be bored and depressed.  The Beatles make me happy, but  can be too goofy sometimes.  If you feel the same way as I do, then you'll  LOVE this band and this album.
0553565915|5.0|Profound spiritual experiences such as Betty Eadie's are beyond description in mere words.  She describes her journey using a great deal of Christian imagery, but this is to be expected, since she herself is Christian.  For those of us who do not come from a Christian background and  may not feel comfortable with descriptions of demons and angels going to  battle, the important thing to remember is that these elements indicate the  way her mind interpreted the events she experienced.  Perhaps someone else  would have told the story very differently.  Such is the nature of these  experiences.  It's not like reading a news article!  The story is to be  read with the emotions and heart, not with an objective, literal mind.
B00000J7J4|2.0|I really like Santana, but this album doesn't do much for me. Just adding some of the newer artists such as Everlast and Dave Matthews and the God-awful Lauryn Hill, doesn't mean you should run out and buy this. Let  the fifteen year olds buy this album because their favorites are on it.  Carlos is good, but this album just sort of confuses most REAL Santana  fans. It's okay, but not more than two stars, and that's being really  nice...&quot;all star&quot; music CD's don't ever impress me anyway,  especially this one.
0792839846|5.0|What is striking about the movie first is its setting: The waystation between Nazi Europe and America.  The characterization is excellent.  Bogart and Bergman play opposite each other extremely well, and Claude  Rains is absolutely fabulous. Rains is witty, well played, and his humor is  well timed and dry as a bone.  All around, there isn't one person who plays  his/her character poorly.  Even extras with one line contribute to the  movie's overall greatness.  See it.  Overall, an excellent movie with a  good story, and a GREAT ending.
6305265488|5.0|i just loved this movie! i have seen it at least 7 times already! it's romantic and fun with rich characters and a heroine you root for! drew barrymore plays &quot;danielle&quot; the poor servant girl who steals the  heart of the prince. as &quot;prince henry&quot;, dougray scott is utterly  (forgive me) charming! keep your eyes on him in the future, i believe he is  the next major international star.     angelica huston is wickedly  wonderful as the &quot;evil stepmother&quot;. this movie is warm,funny and  romantic without being to sappy. i'd say more but i'm going to go watch  &quot;ever after&quot; now. buy it, rent it, but dont miss it!
B00000FBRE|5.0|This album is amazing from start to finish.  The only slight weak point is the cover of &quot;Everything Turns Grey,&quot; which is a bit out of place among this group of songs, and demonstrates that Lagwagon writes better  songs than Agent Orange did.  Other than that-- superb.  I've heard a rumor  that Lagwagon will release something called &quot;Let's Talk About  Leftovers&quot; early next year... don't know about the rest of you, but my  fingers are crossed.
B00000K3UR|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, I thought it was very funny ans somewhat emotional.  Adam Sandler is a wonderful actor, this movie deserves a 5 star report.
1573226521|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The characters were interesting and entertaining.  I found the story to be really imaginative and exciting.  This book inspired me to go back-packing in Thailand.  I've already booked  the plane tickets!!
0156711427|3.0|The plot is simple and average.  It does, however, offers the reader a glimpse into the era of British India.
B000002699|5.0|'that's right' says miles. this is undoubtedly the best record i've ever heard. Period. That's it. Nobody will ever make a record this good.
0783229100|3.0|I was a bit disappointed at &quot;The Sting.&quot; One hears often that it's a classic, but I found the story convoluted, the characters half-baked and the action...well, missing.Newmann and Redford both do well with their  parts, but everyone else seems to be a tertiary adjunct to them. Even  Robert Shaw as the villainous racketeer Doyle Lonnigan is not given much to  do. In the end, I was left wondering, to use a cliche, what all the hype is  about. And the surprise ending? I wasn't even sure what it was intended to  be. Not a bad movie by any stretch, but not Newmann's or Shaw's finest.
0425170349|2.0|You have to wonder if Tom Clancy has fired his editor. This book is much too long. Which is too bad, because the basic story is good and the action sequences are very good. However, it would have been a much better book if  it had been boiled down to half its size, or even less. In order to get at  the story, you have to wade through page after page of pointless  introspection, needless description, and unnecessary dialog. As a long time  fan of Clancy's work, I was disappointed. == Come on Tom, you can do much  better than this.
B000002H97|4.0|The Unforgiven is by far my favorite song so far on the cd.  It is melancholy and deep, but with still the same sound Metallica is known for.  This cd does not disappoint.
B000001Y2U|3.0|I like to call this record &quot;death pop.&quot;  I'm surprised more people haven't noticed how Trent lifted and watered down Fear Factory's sound (Demanufacture) to make this record.<BR><BR> So, while this isn't the  real thing, it's saved by Marilyn Manson's caustic lyrics on Beltway  morality.  Unlike Trent, Manson is on the joke and writes a bruising,  offensive satire on middle-class Christian culture.  I don't necesarilly  agree or disagree with his viewpoints, but it's rare to read anything this  intelligent anymore in mainstream rock.<BR><BR>
0380789019|5.0|I picked neverwhere up oneday and I've read it four times since then. An absolute masterpiece by Gaiman and as far as I've read... his absolute BEST!!!
0385493827|5.0|I thought this book was fabulous !! The change in writing style over his previous novels proves he is one of the most talented authors today !!
B000002UAX|5.0|Though the Beatles released the greatest rock albums in history, I find this one the most compelling.  It's all about opposites--ridiculous, beautiful, loud, quiet, etc.  Perhaps the best thing about the album is  that it remains fresh and unique even after 30 years.  Revolution 9 is  easily the weirdest thing ever recorded.  <br />There's stuff for everyone,  but my favorite section is the connected &quot;Wild Honey  Pie&quot;-&quot;The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill&quot;-&quot;While My  Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; cycle.  The album is not about individual songs,  but about the spectrum of emotions the listener hears and experiences.   Each of the band members lets his personality stand out, and that's one  reason its so marvelous.
B000002UAX|5.0|It's not all great. It's not all good. Heck, some parts of it are downright bad. But the White Album still stands as a milestone in the history of popular music. It's notable, firstly, because of the sustained  use of musical pastiche; secondly, because of the bewildering variety of  musical genres covered across its 30-odd songs; and thirdly, because the  Beatles here combined their classic songcraft ('Blackbird', 'Dear  Prudence') with new elements: political awareness ('Revolution 1'),  experimentation ('Revolution No. 9') and nostalgia ('Honey Pie'). Hearing  this album is like listening to a running commentary on the whole history  of 20th century popular music. And it's a commentary that somehow would  have been less powerful if it had been shortened to a single album.  Paradoxically, little bits like 'Wild Honey Pie' and 'Why Don't We Do It In  The Road' (in themselves dispensable) add something valuable to the whole  album.  <br />Very, very few artists can claim to be bracketed with the  Beatles in terms of musical influence and importance. Dylan and the Velvet  Underground, certainly; the Beach Boys, certainly not. (Who took up their  legacy of falsetto harmonies, anyway? The Bee Gees, possibly. In which case  Mr. Wilson has a lot to answer for.) And frankly, anyone who places Blondie  or Sheryl Crow above the Beatles deserves a hearing aid. And maybe their  own slot on Saturday Night Live.
6300248569|1.0|The acting was forced and this &quot;Lizzy&quot; showed little spirit
B000002UAR|5.0|Pump up the Sheryl Crow or mediocre AOR stuff like Fleetwood Mac and The Eagles. Leave inferior albums like this to the poor deluded souls who appreciate orginality, craft and songwriting.
0783222734|5.0|I saw this movie when I was twelve at a brand new movie theatre with state of the art sound.  It was the most fun I've ever had at the movies.  Michael Crichton's ingenious plot provided a great backdrop for Steven  Spielberg to show off his amazing skill as a director.  The T-rex attack at  the center of the movie is one of the most viscerally frightening scenes in  film history.  It displays Spielberg's kinetic genious as the dinosaur  knocks over the Ford Explorer, pins the screaming kids under the glass and  finally eats someone at it's terrifyingly funny climax.  The movie  continues its rollercoaster thrills as the story winds down to a thrilling  raptor battle in the kitchen.  People who like the book better need to  realize the book didn't have to worry about making the dinosaurs seen.   Spielberg will forever be remembered--along with Hitchcock, Scorcese, and  Kubrick--as one America's greatest storytellers.  Who else can turn stories  of war(Saving Private Ryan), Holocaust(Schindler's List), and rousing boys'  adventures(this and the Indiana Jones films) into tales of Homeric  proporations. Just amazing.
6304981635|5.0|have seen this movie almost 10 times now since i bought it 3 or 4 months ago.. very nicely reproduced using digitial technology! greate movie to see over and over...
0792151720|3.0|If you see this movie with the mindset of &quot;I'm just going to sit here on a rainy day and watch a movie&quot;, you'll be fine.  But if you go into it with the idea that you are going to see the greatest movie ever made,  you're going to be incredibly disappointed.  The love story plot is  mediocre at best, and the movie doesn't seem to get interesting until the  boat starts to sink.  Everyone knows how the movie ends, but unlike, say,  Apollo 13, which keeps you interested in the characters despite knowing the  outcome, Titanic makes you wish that both Rose and Jack would end up frozen  in the Atlantic.  I've definitely seen better movies, but on the other  hand, I've also seen much worse.  I think James Cameron should stick to  movies like Terminater, but that's just my opinion.
6304169558|2.0|Right hand red, left foot green, Twister, yeah, Twister, from MB.  TWISTER was about as silly and corny as my joke.  Great effects, but by time they had the tractor-trailer caught up in the tornado, they may as well have  thrown in Yankee Stadium.  The dopey romance (Duh, will they get back  together?  Duh, I dunno.) interrupts the tension that may have been able to  build.  See TWISTER on cable, where it's worth the price.
B00000JPH5|5.0|It's become a cult classic!  If you haven't yet seen this movie - WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN HIDING?!  It is a MUST for any video collection!  David Bowie is excellent, Jennifer Connelly is perfect, and all of Jim Hensen's  creatures are great.  I've been waiting (and not very patiently, mind you)  years for them to re-release this classic. . .  Chilly Down!
0767802659|5.0|This movie wasn't at all the big action movie that they tried to make it, but it was still a very cool movie. It is so violent, you actually find yourself laughing when someone dies. If you like lots of mindless violence  and laughs this moive is a good choice.
B000002VTE|5.0|Okay, without having to go over any band history or previous accomplishments, including other albums or anything else that doesn't matter, let's look at this album, yes, this one.  If you're considering  buying it, then do, because it's a classic. Not because of the hype around  it when it first hit the bins, and not because of it's cool packaging, but  because it's an original experience. There simply isn't anything out there  that's very close to this recording, so please, if you've never heard it,  then give it a shot.  I like to listen to music while I drive. The first  time I heard this album I was on a long trip, by myself, driving in the car  and spacing out to this masterful recording. If you're into music that  makes you lose control of that certain part deep down inside where you make  your thoughts up, then look no further.  You know it's good. Buy it.
6305508550|3.0|This movie was OK!!! It had some pretty funny parts, but most of the time it brought on more of a snicker then a laugh. I don't know maybe it would appeal more to someone who actually works in a big office. I think it's  good enough to rent, but I definitely wouldn't buy it.
0345409671|4.0|This book took me by surprise. I expected a continuation of the Vampire Chronicles; instead, I got a fascinating alternative viewpoint on Biblical theology. Being well versed in these matters, the book was especially  interesting for me because Anne has clearly done her homework down to the  last detail. But if you are not a Bible buff, do not despair: the book is  as riveting and as gutsy as its predecessors. If you're in the mood to bite  off a bit more than you can chew, this is the book for you.
6303567126|5.0|This is the best movie I have ever seen. It goes deep inside the streets of New York City and its not one of those all hollywood made movie. It shows the side to drugs so many people have not seen. And I dont like the  movie just because Leo is in it I like it because, its a true story and its  very very good and I hope that everyone sees it its worth renting
B000001DYY|3.0|While it's not a concept album as such, ELEMENTAL does seem to flow musically.  Still, it sounds like an unfinished album.  &quot;Gas Giants,&quot; &quot;Power&quot;, and &quot;Brian Wilson Said&quot; sort of  just meander together with no apparent point-- they would have been best  left separate.   Sometimes, meandering works, though.  &quot;Mr.  Pessimist,&quot; even though it has several different sections, darkly  mutters thru the best six minutes on the album.  When he's focused, Roland  nails songs like the title track, &quot;Cold,&quot; &quot;Dog's A Best  Friend's Dog,&quot; and &quot;fish.&quot;  More of that, and a little more  cohesiveness, would have made this the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; that TFF  tried for (and had already almost achieved on SEEDS OF LOVE, anyway).  Nevertheless, like all TFF, this is an album well worth owning and still  better than 99 percent of what's on the radio today.
0393317552|5.0|Fascinating, illuminating, in-depth, very well argued, extremely convincing and usefull - best book I have read in years. One of a kind and surely difficult to beat.
1573225517|5.0|You've met the protagonist of this book.  He's a nice guy, but he just... hasn't grown up.  That's okay, though, it's part of his charm.<br />Although they are very different writers, Hornby reminds me of Richard Ford. Both  manage to capture what it is that men feel when they don't understand what  the heck is going on with the women in their lives, in a way that's neither  condescending nor apologetic.<br />There's so much to admire in this book -  great characters, a good turn of phrase, and a generosity of spirit.  I  loved this book more than anything else I've read in the last twelve  months.
B00001OH1S|1.0|It Is Just Very uncreative.    waste of money
0790729733|1.0|This is truly a bad movie....The historical &quot;premise&quot; is incorrect. JFK expanded the war in Vietnam, and there is no reason to believe that he would have changed his mind if he had not been assasinated.  The conspiracy plot is laughable.  I did not think it was possible for me  to feel sympathy for Lyndon Johnson, a failure as President, but the movie  almost invoked those feelings by portraying him as a conspirator against  JFK.    Kevin Costner is awful as Garrison.  His accent is amateurish, for  example. Tommy Lee Jones is the only actor who puts in a credible  performance.
B000002UD1|4.0|John Lennon was a man of his time.  If you didn't experience this music when it was originally released, you may not appreciate it now.  No, this is not &quot;classic&quot; Lennon work, but it is good stuff.  It is an  attempt on Lennon's part to be more commercial, but the songs fell short.   It is an entertaining collection of songs though.  Lennon does seem un-even  in this album, but he still provides some nice above average work.
0380973464|4.0|At first Cryptonomicon was confusing because the chapters started to alternate between just before World War II and somewhere like a year from now.  However, it didn't take long to establish there were two moments in  the time line happening here, and that these seemingly unrelated events  were being woven together in an intricate pattern.  I've never encoutered a  story that took this approach and managed to bring it all together at the  very last possible moment and make it fit so well.  Embedded within the  story are references to technology that exists today -- the o/s stuff is  real [BeOS,Linux], the crypto stuff [PGP] is real (and well explained!),  the math is real.  One really has give the author his dues when executable  Perl script is a necessary part of the plot.  The book was just as  educational as it was entertaining.  Yes, there were some noticable typos  across 918 pages, but it didn't detract at all.  Stephenson has a hit.
B00000J7J7|5.0|I have been listening to Brad for years and have enjoyed discovering that each time I hear him he has progressed.  Years ago his music was complex and seductive; it has now grown to become one of the most powerful artistic  forces around.  This solo album releases an oversized talent to run free,  play, meditate and yes, mourn.<br />It's great to know that his creations will  continue to grow for decades more.  Buy this album.  Then go buy all his  others.  They're worth it.
6305426651|5.0|Life is Beautiful is a wonderful, moving, TRUE story of one's families experience in WWII Europe and eventually the horrors of the Holocaust.  I never believed I would be able to find humor in a movie depicting the Nazi  war machine and its attempt to elimate European Jewry from the face of the  earth.  What Benigni does is simply amazing.  He makes everyone laugh at  his antics while feeling incredibly sad only a few moments later.  This  journey of emotions is something you rarely find in films these days.  I  applaud Benigni et al and suggest that everyone buy this movie and watch it  over and over again.
0385493800|5.0|After reading several of Grisham's books, I was pleased to read this new book that unfolds the spiritual side of the master author.  I will assume that this will be one book that probably most fans will not enjoy nor  understand.  Until someone has experienced the Grace that Jesus Christ has  to offer will they comprehend the religious concepts in this book: Money  doesn't matter.  Callings on Lives.  Purity and Happiness. Eternal Value of  Life and Works.  Faith in Jesus. Grisham has created a classic that will  appeal to those who have met Christ as their personal saviour.  Still, I  recommend this book for Christians and Non-Christians alike.  It is well  written, and although it drags in some places, overall, it's a winner.  A  life transformed by Jesus is not a flaw in character development.  It is a  true reality that millions know about.  Life with Christ is an endless  hope.  Life without Christ is a hopeless end...
079073804X|5.0|When I was in Jr. High I used to watch horror movies as a hobby.  I especially liked watching the ones that everyone said were the scariest - movies like Night of the Living Dead (not at all scary); Texas Chain Saw  Massacre (gross, not scary); etc.<br />Anyway after a long time at this, I got  pretty jaded, thinking that there really weren't any scary movies out  there.  Then someone suggested the Exorcist.  Well...my parents said I  couldn't watch it.  So I waited til they were on a trip and I was home  alone...<br />I rented the thing and watched it by myself late one night.  Now  for those of you who have already seen this, you know what the effect was.   It puts things in your head that you cannot get rid of.  I tried sleeping  to no avail.  I had that face, and worst of all that voice plastereed into  my subconscious all night.  I NEVER had a movie give me nightmares, but  this one did.<br />I watch it now, and yes, the special effects are sometimes  a little cheesy (the spinning head), but the movie still creates an overall  atmosphere of utter creepiness that has not been topped to this day.
B000002HHB|2.0|Merchant's lyrics were always one of the Maniacs' greatest strengths, and on this album she shows she still has the kack. But musically, it's a huge dissapointment. The melodies and arrangements sound like cover band clones  of classic Maniacs songs, to the point where the songs themselves start to  sound like watered down versions of old Maniacs tunes. Very disappointing.
B00000J7J4|5.0|This cd is worth buying for &quot;Smooth&quot; alone.  What an incredible song!  Nevermind that the rest of the songs are great too.   What AWESOME music from a guy that has been around a long, long time!
B00001OH1S|4.0|An excellent soundtrack, most likely one of the best of the year. Sinnerman is absolutly amasing, I can't take it off repeat on my CD player. The instrumental tracks by Bill Conti are brief, but if you like the movie  you'll see how the fit and. The music keeps up a quick and light hearted  pace and the theme seemingly is well preserved thru the instrumental  tracks.
6305169195|3.0|Special effects were great. Action was high intensity. Too bad the story had too many faults and was very misogynistic.
067144901X|5.0|My 15-month old daughter knows all her animal sounds, thanks to this book.  I first saw it at her daycare, and bought it for her when she was 7-months old.  This book was quite the favorite, and before she was a year old, she was making the appropriate sounds, shaking her head, &quot;No, no...&quot;  at the, &quot;Three singing pigs go la-la-la,&quot; and whispering at the  last page, &quot;It's quiet now, what do *you* say?&quot;
B00000K2SE|4.0|Sci-fi fans will appreciate (and likely recognize) the basic plot and subplots of this film.   It's clearly destined to become a sci-fi (cult?) classic.   'Compelling story and great effects.  But don't look away for a  moment!  Even when you stay glued to the screen, you're likely to suffer  lingering questions.  Quite a few threads remain unravelled.   As much as I  enjoyed Matrix, I believe they've left lots of room for a sequel which  could lead us to richer fields of thought than the first  &quot;episode&quot; did!   Gutsy production -- go for it.
B00001OH1S|5.0|This is a quietly sensational sound track.  While listening to it I felt as if I were eavsdropping on every note.  The music takes you on a peaceful journey from which you never wish to return.
B0000025JT|5.0|Barry Gibb and Barbra Streisand, teamed, are an immeasurable source of beauty and harmony.  I first heard this album in 1980, on vinyl - one of the greatest influences passed on from my mother. Now, at 22, it remains as  my favourite album of all time - Woman in Love still gives me chills.  An  esoteric and gorgeous teaming of beauty, brains and courage.<br />I'd also  like to comment on MarkE's comments on this album: Barry Gibb did a lot  more with regards to this album than wear a tight pair of pants, though I  don't disagree he does it well.
B000001IQH|5.0|Lets go is Rancid's best album.  Every song on the CD is punk to the extreme.  If you listen to punk but don't have this one, buy it and buy it now.
0671578278|5.0|I have followed this series since the beginning, and this is a delightful change of pace, reminiscent of those 18th century drawing room comedies-of-eros, with politics thrown in for good measure. I was ROTFL during a lot of it, which amazed my children, as I was visiting them when I  bought the book. It is a must read for anyone who just loves humor, with  some dramatic relief.
0792156684|1.0|Glitter and more glitter, with very little REAL people or story.  How magnificent to have the terrible human tragedy of the Titanic reduced to DiCaprio and Winslett mugging in front of the camera. I guess the pretty  faces and special effects were supposed to cover for the lack of substance  and humanity. Still, if EVERYONE likes this movie, that must make it good,  right?  Rent &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;, you will, at least remember  what Titanic is really about.
068484267X|2.0|I found this book to be very repetitive and depressing.  After finishing this, I gave it to my mother to read.  She is 66 years old and was born and raised in Galway, Ireland.  After reading it, she was furious.  She grew up on a farm and said that she NEVER saw the kind of poverty that McCourt was  talking about.  Her father was NOT a drunk, either.  Many people who have  read this book apparently think that this is what life was like in Ireland  for everyone.  My mother had a very happy childhood over there.  She ended  up coming to America because of the lack of opportunity in her homeland.   Today, Ireland is one of the wealthiest nations in the world.  I have no  doubt that McCourt grew up in poverty, but many Irish people feel that he  got carried away with himself in this book.  Angela's Ashes won the  Pulitzer Prize because it was about poverty, and that's a politically  correct issue these days.
0375707972|3.0|I liked the clean/spare writing style, the briefness of the book particularly juxtaposed with the moral dilemmas Schlink is trying to address- they could clearly fill tomes.Ultimately it is too  spare. Who is  Hannah? An abused child? A sadist? A woman of limited intelligence? A  borderline personality? I never understood her choices.Any real insight  into them was lost for me.
0425129586|4.0|This book keeps you guessing until the very end. It is a must read and you'll find you won't be able to put it down!!
6303192459|5.0|A GREAT MOVIE; you could watch it over and over again and still be enchanted by its superb acting and emotional plot.  If you haven't seen it, you are missing out on one of the best films ever created.
B0000004V2|5.0|It's difficult to express just how powerfully this album still reverberates. Not just in Manchester, where I first heard their spangly rhythms, and Ian Brown's narcissistic wail, but every where. The Roses were  icons long before they disappeared to produce the long awaited and under  rated Second Coming. And is there anyone who's heard the album who doesn't  forget exactly what they're doing as soon as the the intro to Waterfall  kicks in? They were a band for their time, for a moment, but it runs deeper  than that. They were the Manchester scene. It's still impossible to imagine  it without them. John Squire put their media shyness down to  &quot;perpetuating the myth&quot;. There was no need. The music made the  myth. It still stands today.
B000002UAO|5.0|i think anything i could say has already been said before, but i would just like to add that the song &quot;norwegian wood&quot; has got to be one of the most beautiful ballads ever.  this an excellent easy-to-listen to  album.
B000002HK4|5.0|This is the album I bought when I started listening to DT. At the time, I didn't even know who they were, but this is by far my favorite cd of all the Dream Theater albums except for &quot;Awake.&quot; This is the  definitive DT EP!
B000002UAU|5.0|well, i would definitely have to say that this album is truely amazing to me.  being 15 and surrounded by the *ahem* terrible music of britney spears and unoriginal copy-cat boy bands (no offense), it was really refreshing to  know that good music does, in fact, exist... even if you have to go back  more than 30 years to find it.  this album was truely revolutionary.  and i  don't know what that guy was talking about when he insulted the song  &quot;For the Benefit of Mr. Kite&quot;.  he must be insane, because that  is an awesome song.
6301796535|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES EVER,AND NO ONE ELSE COULD HAVE POSSIBLY HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB THAN JULIA ROBERTS AND RICHERD GERE,BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,THINGS LIKE THAT NEVER WOULD HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE,WOULD THEY??? BUT  WHAT MADE IT A GOOD MOVIE WAS ITS PLOT,AND STORY LINE,WHICH MADE IT ONE OF  THE MOST IRRESISTIBLE ROMANTIC/COMDIES OF ALL TIME.DEFINTELY NOT A WASTE OF  MONEY!
630349255X|5.0|Every time I watch this movie, I'm reminded how amazing this world is, and how much of it I'm sheltered from.  Moving.  Amazing.  See it.
6301236947|5.0|This movie came out when I was in high school, and I think I saw it 15 times at the theater, and have watched it 20+ times on video, however, I never tire of it or fail to get goosebumps when Bono sings, well, anything.   The only bummer about this is how U2 used to stand for so much and write  such powerful and compelling music, and have now really &quot;sold  out&quot; to the mainstream.  We can only hope their upcoming album will  reach back to their original style.
0783227434|4.0|The hilarious horror of the first two Evil Dead films is missing in this third instalment.  That's OK, though, because the lack of horror has allowed Sam Raimi to develop the &quot;cheesiness verses evil/sexy fantasy  world&quot; seen later in his glorious Xena and Hercules series.  Like  Laurel and Hardy, it's hard to tell whether Army of Darkness is  under-played or over-played - strange, not Hollywood, and all the better  for it.  Well done, Sam - I liked your new movie &quot;A Simple Plan&quot;  too.
B0000025DT|5.0|It's far to say that Jeff Lynne picked up where the Beatles left off sans the ability to play any type of music.  1976's A New World Record showcases once again that Jeff Lynne is THE most overlooked singer / songwriter /  producer / musician in the history of recorded music.  E.L.O's trademark of  scoring an orchestra to perfectly written rock songs is showcased no better  than on this album.  I grew up on this album as my father was quite fond of  it for many years.  One of the most dark, trippy and wonderful pieces of  music can be found in the bridge section of &quot;Mission.&quot;  &quot;And  all the stars above, rain icy fingers down on me.&quot;  True beauty, true  genius.  This is an unmatched masterpiece from Jeff Lynne and co.  Give  yourself a treat and purchase this gorgeous, flawless album.
0062502182|5.0|This book has become one of my alltime favorites. I recommend it constantly to friends and families who enjoy spending time together, learning about the world and what it offers us.  For anyone wandering this planet in search of a path, this book shows us it is at our feet, we  need  only pay attention and follow the omens to find our way.  Reading this book  together as a family would  offer many an evening of rousing discussion. `
B00000K0DT|5.0|Forget Pulp Fiction, move over Resevoir Dogs, The Usual Suspects makes those efforts look amateur.  The ensemble cast (epecially Kevin Spacey who won an academy award for this role) is phenomenal and the interplay between  characters in this film is so tight that you are surprised at every turn.   The script is well-written and directed superbly.  The action starts with a  body count of 27 and only one clue--&quot;Keyser Sose&quot; the last words  of a dying witness.  Thus begins one of the most stylish films I have seen  in years.  Do not miss this film!
B000002L5P|5.0|The Smiths exploded onto the music scene with this bold, controversial, and inovative cd.  They seemed to have wanted to pull out all the stops in order to make a lasting impression.  No better is this evident in  Morrissey's lyrics.  Sometimes cunningly vailed, (&quot;The Hand that Rocks  the Cradle&quot; and &quot;Hand in Glove&quot;) other times surprisingly  direct (&quot;Miserable Lie&quot; and Pretty Girls Make Graves&quot;) these  lyrics are sure to make a lasting impact.  Probably not the best of The  Smiths cds (I would have to pick &quot;The Queen is Dead&quot;) this is  still an all-together excellent cd that is sure to delight fans.
B00000F1D3|5.0|This CD could easily be hailed as the definitive album of the late 90's club scene.  Together with Madonna's Ray of Light, Believe brings lyrical depth and emotion to a genre previously void of much artistic expression.   Here is a warning though, if you do not like pop/dance music....you will  NOT like this CD.  From top to bottom, it is pure energy and never misses a  beat.  Even though no other single is likely to equal the success of  &quot;Believe,&quot; such songs as &quot;Strong Enough,&quot; &quot;The  Power,&quot; &quot;All or Nothing,&quot; and &quot;Dove L'amore&quot; are  stunningly beautiful, well written, and emotionally delivered.  While most  dance albums are monotonous and begin to sound the same after a few songs,  Cher has given each song a distinct sound and feel.  Helping to avhieve  this is an array of talented producers, each with their own style.  From  the &quot;pure dance&quot; sound of &quot;Runaway&quot; and &quot;Taxi  Taxi,&quot; to the haunting &quot;The Power&quot; Cher takes you on a  journey that includes the latin sounds of &quot;Dove L'Amore&quot; and the  disco beats of Dianne Warren's &quot;Takin' Back My Heart.&quot;  The best  thing about this CD is Cher's vocal delivery. Never claiming to be a Celine  Dion or Barbra Streisand, Cher has chosen songs that fit her vocal style  and range.  Each song is performed with an emotional and believable  delivery that is second to none.  Also, these are songs that everyone can  relate to at some time or another in their lives.  Ten years from now,  looking back, I predict that this album will still be remembered as a  landmark.  If nothing else, for broadening a fan base from grandparents to  club kids and bridging a generational gap no other artist has been able to  do.
B00001OH1S|5.0|This music will take you to the French Caribbean, sooth you like a warm island breeze and make you feel very happy.  This CD is a great blend of sophisticated artists, if you like the way Sade, Chris Isaak &amp; Bob  Marley make you feel then you will like this as well.
1878424165|5.0|I have read this book many times and has become a part of my life, the laws described in the book have become guiding principles of my life. My spirits lifts up whenever I read the book and the book encourages me to  achieve more out of life. I'm planning to give this book as a gift to one  of my best friend. Read this book and cherish it, it will change your  life!!
0380973634|4.0|this is a strange, funny, creepy, interesting, uncomfortable, twitchy, atmospheric, poetic book.  how someone can write about characters who have no souls and no compassion and nothing that would make them remotely human or likable, and then on the next page write about the kindest, most human  things is completely beyond me, but however you do it, neil does.  nothing  happened quite the way i expected it to, and to be completely honest i  didn't think richard, the main character, had much of a character, but it  was a good read and i was amazed at how neil can write so beautifully about  the ugliest, most horrendous things.

0792151712|2.0|I have to say I enjoyed it enough a the time, but only because it looked good.  But....Kate and Leo looked like mother and son!  Neither were particularly appealing or believable (or attractive).  It could have been  great, but it settled for mainstream, mediocre smaltz.  And as for James  Cameron at the Oscars.....Gimme a break!  King of the world? King of an Ego  more like it!
6301404440|5.0|i purchased this movie probably about 6 yours ago and still find it as funny as the day i bought it.  it has enough innuendos and adult jokes to keep the interest of the older crowds, and is still clean enough that if i  had children i would let them watch this movie. it has the old 'bugs bunny  and animaniacs' humor the really keep your attention and be suprisingly  enjoyable.  i will continue to watch this on a regular baasis
0064471837|5.0|I really loved this book. It was soo kool. Im 14 and my friends and I really love fantasy.A friend of my Moms gave it to me and i adored it. Its about this 18 year old girl who has a very interesting familiy history. She  is next in line to become an Abhorsen. It tells a story of her journey to  find her father and her struggles and triumphs along the way. Its filled  with lots of little hints that keep you guessing. I really reccommend this  book for everyone who like a good story and a fantasy twist.
0679735909|5.0|I have loved this novel long and well.  It has a place on my 'annuals' list just behind Jane Austen and George Eliot.  When the autumn leaves begin to fall I reach for my much marked copy autmatically. Byatt has  created both unique mystery and romances in Possession.  The intelocking  stories and the questions she raises seem larger and bolder to me each time  I read it.  I like that Byatt reminds readers it is important to go out  in the world _and_ that it is important to sit and dream.m Or that all of  modern answers do fully fit past event and NEVER will.  This story always  takes my breath away and I find myself referring back to it as I read other  works. A great novel.
0783225849|5.0|Psycho is an outstanding film.  Very, very Hitchcockian. Super scary, Anthony Perkins' &quot;mother&quot; makes Hannibal Lecter look like Barney.  The cinematography is disturbing, especially where the camera stays the  same distance away from an actor as they walk so it looks like the world is  moving around them and they aren't moving (have you ever felt like that?).   Some people don't understand why this movie is so scary, I think it's  because they want to see more violence.  Actually, this film as incredibly  violent, except that you never see the violence, which generates fear of  the unknown.  Fear of the unknown is much more chilling than when you  actually see someone being cut up.  Gore can add to the atmosphere, but  if  there were any more atmosphere it would swallow up the movie.  See this  movie, watch it sitting alone, in a dark vacant room.  Norman has twelve  such rooms...
0345389409|5.0|This book and its ideas are laid out well and get the reader to face the possibilities of good and evil.  This book attacks your mind, forcing you to confront your ideas of good and evil.  This is a must  read!
0131103709|1.0|This book was really bad!  There were no examples at all!  I couldn't understand a single page form author.  It is obvious that Kenighan has no idea what he's talking about.  The book should be titled C The Hardway...  I prefer and recommend C For Dummies.  That book was easier to read and I  was able to start programming really quickly.  Do not get this awful  book... there were no examples, and the explanations were really terse.  I  wasted my money on this book, I hope nobody else does...
B000000HU1|5.0|One of the best, and most underrated prog rock albums ever. Great guitar and horn/flute soloing, and tight, groove-based rhythm section work. Tim Blake's synth sounds are unreal - possibly the best use of the instrument  in a fusion setting. This record does not disapoint. Buy it!
B000002OOY|5.0|The original motion picture soundtrack from Jurassic Park, composed and conducted by John Williams, is a wonderful dramatic score that captures perfectly the spirit of a lost world, completely different from the world  we live in today: the incredible world of dinosaurs. Just listen and let  this extraordinary score takes you to a world where nature and its  inhabitants lived in perfect harmony. Then you will understand why this  soundtrack is so special. It gives inspiration to millions of people. Let  it inspire you too.
044022425X|3.0|This isn't the best book of the series. The first 500 pages were terrible.  After that, I liked it more and more.  Brianna and Roger aren't developed, they don't get to my heart like Claire and Jamie do.  I almost don't care what happens to them.  They're even stupid sometimes.  Also, I don't like  the predictability.  This book was my least favorite in the series by far.  I don't how you guys can rate this, &quot;This is the best book I ever  read&quot;.  Read Gone with the Wind and then let us know how you feel  about this one.  There aren't enough historical references for me here at  all.  At least Outlander was well researched.  This book could've taken  place at anytime and we wouldn't have noticed.  The story starts to get  worn out and tired after awhile.  In Outlander, it was gripping, something  was happening every single page.  This was a bore....Sorry, Diana.  I hope  the next one is a winner! And you know I'll be reading it anyway...
0792153294|5.0|The best disaster movie I've seen since &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;.  The events portrayed in this movie actually seem feasible &amp; I honestly believe it could really happen someday.  The pace of the film was  excellent; it never dragged along unnecessarily but got right to the point.   The acting (particularly Morgan Freeman) was outstanding throughout.  This  movie stayed with me for a while, which is more than I can say about most  of the ones I've seen.  Give it a try; I don't think you'll be  disappointed.
0780625129|5.0|The best portrayal of life on the streets as a young white male the movie screen has ever seen.  Finally the movie that shows the other side of the streets and the white male's stuggles and decision making in an interracial  society.  Anyone not locked in a closet for the length of their adolesence  could get into this movie.  A hard packed intense drama that hits close to  home for many.  Absolutely the best movie I have ever seen.
B000000H64|5.0|Fear Factory is probably the most popular of all metal bands to get started up in the 90s and this album is the reason why. There isn't a single bad song here, not even a single mediocre song either. The title  track and Replica stand out above the rest though as some ridiculosly good  metal, i've heard VERY few songs as good as those. If you like metal then  buy this, its very simple
068815333X|5.0|Couldn't put this one down -- it was almost as good as the first four in the series!  Patrick Lehane has a dry wit and it comes through in the characters' reactions to things.  His knowledge of Boston is wonderful and  right on the money.  I was a little disappointed in some of the cliched  interaction between Bubba and Kenzie, but overall the book was wonderful.   One of only two series I would read again -- the Prey series by Sandford is  the other and he used to be my favorite author.  Lehane now tops my list!   Well worth buying in hardcover -- Lehane is a gem!
6302902010|5.0|I am purchasing this copy but somewhat under protest as I would like to have a copy of the original movie, Porgy &amp; Bess.  Please continue your search for those of us who would like to reflect on the 50's version &amp;  compare to the updated version.  Vihay
0792837916|5.0|Though it is generally regarded as a &quot;good&quot; movie, I think it is much more than that.  It is one of the most perfect films ever made from it's razor sharp dialogue to the first rate performances to the excellent  cinematography.  Travolta should've been oscar nominated and I still love  watching Dennis Farina chew the scenery as Ray &quot;Bones&quot; Barboni.   Outstanding.
B00000K19E|5.0|When movie historians look back on &quot;The Matrix,&quot; it will rightfully take its place alongside ground-breaking science fiction juggernauts like Star Wars, 2001 and Planet of the Apes. &quot;The  Matrix&quot; redefined action movie cinemaphotography and sound, setting  new standards by which all others will be judged. Many will copy &quot;The  Matrix,&quot; but it will never be duplicated. The cast is compelling, the  direction revolutionary and the story thought-provoking and refreshingly  free off cliches. Musically, the movie is just as dynamic, producing an  original score and soundtrack that blend perfectly with the visual aspects  of the film. Somehow, this movie becomes more intriguing each time you  watch it. Reeves was tailor-made for the part and Fishburne is wonderfully  understated. Moss is beautiful and, well, a bit nasty. There's only one  problem ... where do you go from here? Mind-blowing! Simply mind-blowing!
B00000FYPB|3.0|I am a huge Stanley Kubrick fan and loved all of his movies, except this one.  That's not to say it was bad, it was quite good at parts, but definitely not up to Kubrick standards.  Technically marvelous, it was shot  in all natural light.  The costumes were marvelous as were the sets and as  a historical movie it was pretty well made.  It was way too long however  and the performances were lifeless to say the least.  Personally I would  have prefered to see Kubrick tackle Napoleon if he was going to do a  historical epic.
B00000JY1X|5.0|Stephen Meritt has long been the indie-rock world's god of songwriters.  With this absolutely mind-blowing 3CD set he has constructed his musical masterpiece -- an opus of love songs that sears the heart with purity,  truth and simplicity.  Spanning 69 songs and music stylings ranging from  punk to pop to country to just plain strange, Merrit traces every possible  nuance and path of love -- obsession, puppy love, loss, betryal, divorce,  abandonment, reunion.  The brilliance of this work (and of each of the  songs) is that even though they wallow in a sense of melancholia, they are  never ring false.  The gravel voiced Merrit counter balances his moribund  fellings with perfectly placed counterpoints and songs of hope and  inspiration.  A true and joyous work of contemporary pop music. And rest  assured that  when the hype settles and trendy critics lay down their pens,  this album will quitely secure it's place as one of the greatest conceptual  albums of the 20th century.
B00000IQBL|5.0|I thought this movie was outstanding, particularly the first half which is the best boot camp sequence to date.  R. Lee Ermey gives a great performance as the drill instructor as does Vincent D'Onofrio as the ill  fated pvt. Pyle.  One of Kubricks best and that says a lot in itself.
B00000099Y|5.0|This album completely blows me away. I have never heard a band as innovative and talented as Tool. Every song on this album is good, i even listen to the non-musical things like (-)Ions and Message to Harry Manback.  Adam Jones isn't the best lead player i've ever heard, but he holds the  songs together amazingly well, and can strum that thing just about as fast  as Dino Cazarez. Danny Carey is one of the best drummers i've ever heard.  The new bass guy Justin Chancellor does a fantastic job. And Maynard James  Keenan is by far one of the best singers in the metal genre, he proves that  you can have an amazing band and sound without just screaming. I recommend  this album to ANYONE! go and buy it!
0140283587|5.0|I laughed out loud almost all the way through this book. Absolutely brilliant.
6303997198|5.0|Each time I viewed this love story I felt I was looking into a window seeing two people who magically came together to find each other and sharing their inside deep emotions that sometimes cannot be put into words  but must be acted out with gestures, and untold emotions that we each have  but sometimes are afraid to admit. She had an untold story deep within  herself that she was unable to convey to her family. Her dreams still  inside but destined to die only because of the disappointment of her life  on the farm.  A disappointment she was willing to accept. When she met this  man who  was a total stranger she conveyed an easiness  of conversation  sometimes with a tease and sometimes showing a bit of sarcasm.  At times  you could almost hear her mind speak silently as he expressed his thoughts  to her in response to her unhappiness.  I can still hear his words speaking  with such intensity about her dreams.  She looked at him as if his words  somehow conforted her. His character being a man of many travels and  experiences amused her and made her feel an excitment of another world.   She was being drawn to him not only because he was different from her life  as she knew it, but felt a real connection with this person who made her  feel differently as a woman. Her day to day routine had been interrupted  and she felt an excitment that she hadn't felt for a very long time.  He,  on the other hand, was on an assignment, and that was it. But the innocence  of their first time meeting gave way to friendship leading to a desire to  meet once again.  I don't believe he was totally aware of her inward  frustrations at the beginning, and in fact he tried to suggest that it  wouldn't be such a good idea for them to meet if it was going to affect her  reputation in this small town.  I do believe he was sincere.  But being a  man of many travels, I'm sure this wasn't the first time he had been in  this kind of situation.  What impressed me the most was their total  honestlyabout their love.  The last scene made you stop and think  &quot;What would I do in a case like that?&quot;  She was right in her  decision. And, he was right to acknowledge his love for her.  It ended as  it should have.  This doesn't mean I agree with adultery.  After viewing  this movie, I had to ask myself could &quot;I&quot; be as strong as she was  when events changed her life so dramatically.  Love is a very deep emotion  and we, individually, are responsible for our own thoughts, actions and  words.
0380789019|5.0|Neverwhere was one of those books that really sticks in my mind. I don't think I'll ever forget its characters and images. At heart it's a standard fish-out-of-water-turned-hero story, but Gaiman's dark humor and incredible  imagination make it far from formulaic. This is the best novel I've read  all year.
B00000BKDV|5.0|This albumn is incredible! I've been listening to it for years and I still have not grown tired of it. Great from beginning to end; every song is flawless! This is one great heavy metal cd!
6305603847|5.0|'Pink' (played by Bob Geldof) has been turned into a rock 'n' roll fascist by the overwhelming excesses of fame, fortune and applause. As Pink subconciously builds his wall between himself and the outside world, Roger  Waters and co-director Alan Parker provide - with the help of animator,  Gerald Scarfe - an insight into how the dark side of success can cause any  level of piece of mind to unwittingly decay into an existance of various  forms of destruction.<br />The music is provided courtesy of Pink Floyd's  album 'The Wall' which was written by Roger Waters. Gerald Scarfe's  startling animation sometimes borders on the horrific, but rarely fails to  entertain.   In addition, Hey You has been included for the fans who missed  it on the original cut, as well as a narrative from Waters and Scarfe.    Part of the intent with this DVD release was to insert a level of humor  missing from the movie's initial release, which for me wasn't without it's  smile-enducing moments.<br />A real 'smack in the face' flick, which by virtue  of an unfurling change in emotional direction at the movie's end, leaves  the viewer feeling a little more positive than might have been anticipated.
B00000J7S8|5.0|I heard the Charlie Rose interview with Diana and was hooked.  Only peeve is that an identifiable Brazilian melody was incorporated into one song -- see if you can hear which! We highly recommend this cd, it's wonderful,  especially on long road trips through the mountains!!!!
0451160916|5.0|&quot;All work, no play, makes Jack a dull boy,&quot; can only be described as words as a seemingly recovering alcoholic isloated in the mountains for the winter. A chilling tale of abuse, dysfunctional families  and hallucinations due to many months away from any part of civilization.  Stephen King has the knack of making those tiny hairs on the back of you  neck stand with just one word. &quot;REDRUM, REDRUM,&quot; words only a  child possessed by the haunting memories of an abusive and alcoholic  father, and an inner voice trying to protect him from more danger his  father can bring to him. When you learn what &quot;The Shining,&quot;  really means, and really can do, that is when you realize the true horror  of what you have read, and experienced.
B00000K3G8|5.0|I haven't seen the movie and, no, I wouldn't even describe myself as a big fan of the Talking Heads but this CD is definitely absolutely fantastic. Features a very nice acoustic version of my personal favourite  &quot;Heaven&quot;.
B0000039LE|5.0|John Carpenter's Halloween was the most successful independent horror movie of all time.  The cast was absolutely perfect.  Donald Pleasance was convincing as the paranoid Dr. Loomis, and Jamie Lee Curtis began her film  career starring in this instant classic.  Even though parts 4-6 were  nothing more than tireless retreads of the Michael Meyers story, this a  must see for any movie fan.  The spine tingling theme music will forever be  embedded in the minds of people who see this movie.
B000002UAO|5.0|I have neither the intelligence to distinguish between 'Rock' and 'Pop' nor the arrogance to sign off a review with the words 'now you know', so all I can humbly suggest to readers of this page is to give this album a  chance. 'Rubber Soul' has been subjected to a great deal of critical  analysis by music writers since its release in 1965. Their response has  been overwhelmingly positive - in the group's catalogue, only 'Revolver'  (and possibly 'Sgt. Pepper' and The White Album) commands such high esteem.  (It's an Amazon.com Essential Recording for a reason, I presume.) I  personally think it's among their top three or four. Hey, but what do I  know? Do a little more reading about the album before you decide to buy it.  A good place to start would be 99% of the reviews below.
B0000024VP|5.0|Many artist's are harmed by a single hit that causes their whole career to be misinterpeted (e.g. Bobby McFerrin).  Donovan's &quot;hippy-dippy&quot; image was actually earned in the late sixties with Atlantis and some  frankly painful live shows.  Listen to the triptych of songs &quot;3 King  Fishers&quot;, &quot;Ferris Wheel&quot;, and &quot;Bert's Blues&quot; and  hear an inventive artist who was his own worst enemy. (I was going to say  that these songs are virtually unknown, but the two preceding reviews  mention some of them.)
B000002HO3|5.0|Great cd! Music that can make you relax or may make you frisky
0790729628|2.0|I love the movie &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and was looking forward to enjoying it in the extra fidelity of DVD. I was shocked as the opening credits jiggled and bled. It was as if someone were sitting in front of a  high-speed dub of a VHS tape with a hand-held camera recording this.  <br />This is not the only DVD product I have viewed where the video quality  was no better than VHS tape. The industry is really screwing up by  releasing substandard quality recordings. <br />I hear the Stanley Kubrick  collection is an abomination. Why is the industry abusing the consumers  like this!!!?
0517543052|5.0|This book explained in words everything that was in my head and still as of now unexplainable by myself.  Read with an open mind and hopefully one may find its truth in everything it says.  <br />P.S. This is not a book about  LSD!!!!!!! As if it wasnt obvious in and of itself.......
630471193X|4.0|I liked this movie a lot. The sound track was good but I swear they switched musical numbers on two scenes. This isn't one of the top 100 movies of all time, but the story is interesting enough to make it worth  viewing multiple times. The ending of the movie is very touching and  reminds me of the end of the movie &quot;Nell&quot; with Jodie Foster --  showing all the people whose lives have been touched by one special person.  I think this is human nature at its best.
B00000IL29|5.0|This is one of the masterpieces of jazz recordings. The compositions are great, the playing is great, and the spirit and mood of the music is special.  This one belongs in everyone's collection.
B00000J7J4|5.0|&quot;Things We Do&quot; break the water of the rebirth of guitar god music.  I don't care for the &quot;guest apperance&quot; deal as a rule, the somehow this one works. Carlos and Mato Nanji (Indigenous) have made me  start paying attention again...
1573226521|5.0|The &quot;Beach&quot; was one of the best books I have read in years. Alex Garland has an incredible command of language and uses it well, creating a realistic type of imagery, that few books can. I found myself not able to  put the book down, and sad that I had finished the book when I did. If you  don't have time to travel to this beach for yourself, let Alex Garland take  you there. My only problem with the book is that Leonardo DiCaprio is going  to star in the movie version...who cast that?  I swear there is no justice  sometimes.
078322799X|4.0|I really wanted more on this DVD of one of my favorite films.  But the &quot;bonus materials&quot; amount to some cast notes and a trailer, and the sound quality keeps fluxing in and out, getting quieter whenever the  sound gets loud.  I thought it might be my TVs &quot;smart sound,&quot; but  its done it on three different systems.  But the Frighteners still rocks!  And to the guy who said the love interest was unneccessary: who cares?  Trini Alvererdo is hot!
B000001EMW|5.0|I bought this CD on the strength of their second effort &quot;Inquisition Symphony&quot; (A brilliant masterpiece btw).  I'm sure I'd have liked this better had I gone the other way round.  This is a more bare bones, acoustic  set. Simply produced and pretty much note for note faithful to the original  tunes, where the second CD is much richer and more developed and includes  some original pieces.  Nevertheless this is a wonderful breath of fresh  air.  A brilliant concept, very well done.  I am rather surprised at how  well Metallica lends itself to &quot;classical&quot; interpretation.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Anyone who calls himself/herself a Phil fan needs this album.  It had all my favorites.
B000001ESP|5.0|Although I'm actually not into rock music, I like some of Rush's releases, especially this one. It is understandable that some fans prefer the subsequent album &quot;Signals&quot;, because it was more accessible and  far less aggressive than this one. &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; is an  intense listening adventure which requires attention! In contrast to all  the other reviewers, I think &quot;YYZ&quot; is just tootle-around and  remains palatable for fans and musicians only. But the rest of this album  comes damn near to perfection. &quot;Red Barchetta&quot; is my absolutely  favourite Rush track, but I also like the gentle synth sounds in the intro  of &quot;The Camera Eye&quot;. &quot;Witch Hunt&quot; is a bit  uncharacteristic for Rush, it reminds me more of some goth rock/dark wave  groups like &quot;Bauhaus&quot; or &quot;Sisters Of Mercy&quot;. I would  say this is Rush's most diversified record and it's their last effort which  captures some true hard rock spirit, before they became cool  techno-rockers. This album still comes up with its dynamic performance,  inspired lyrics and Neil's breakbeat rhythms!
0684800713|5.0|Hemingway was a proponent of the &quot;Iceberg&quot; theory of writing:  90% of his themes are hidden beneath the surface of his books.  He won't lay anything out for you in black and white -- you've got to be an active  participant in the book.  If that's not what you want from a book, stay  away.<br />The Sun Also Rises is fantastic.  It has Hemingway's trademark  prose, a portrait of the lost generation, and most of all the saddest love  story ever written.  &quot;There's no plot!&quot; the detractors scream,  but they're wrong.  The plot isn't spelled out the way it is in a John  Grisham novel, but it's definitely there if you pay attention.  <br />Here's a  hint for those who weren't trying very hard: this book is all about Brett  Ashley and Jake.  Throughout the book Hemingway shows Lady Brett following  a very definite pattern.  She meets a man, &quot;falls in love&quot; with  him, sleeps with him, and dumps him.  She isn't some cynical player when  she does this -- she truly believes that she loves these men during her  infatuations.  But she requires physical proof of their love, i.e. sex, and  once she has it, the infatuation dies.  When the book starts we meet her  latest victim, Cohn.  As the book continues we see a similar relationship  unfold with Romero.<br />But then there's Jake!  She met Jake and fell in love  with him, but a war injury makes him incapable of giving her the physical  love she requires.  As a result, poor pathetic Brett never fell out of love  with Jake, and imagines him as the one man who could be the great love of  her life.  For the longest time Jake believes this as well.<  He's seen  what she did to Cohn, and he's had a ringside seat for her affair with  Romero, and now he's finally realized the truth about her.  When she  fantasizes about the great life they could have had together, he knows it's  just wishful thinking.  If they could have made love, she would have dumped  him just like all the others.<br />At it's heart, TheSun Also Rises is a book  about a man falling out of love.<br />Hemingway's prose is a matter of  opinion.  Some people love his sparse verbage, others don't.  If you don't  care for it, try Fitzgerald, an excellent writer with a much fuller  style.<br />One reviewer mentioned that this was one of Hemingway's earliest  works, and for that reason suggested it wasn't worthy of five stars (he  only gave it two).  I think he said Hemingway wasn't yet a mature writer  and was still trying to develop his style.  What a crock -- Hemingway, like  many authors, did his best work early in his career.  Heck, the guy  eventually committed suicide because he couldn't write anything good  anymore.  His more &quot;mature&quot; works are only passable and can't  hold a candle to the earlier stuff.  His prize for &quot;The Old Man and  the Sea&quot; was more of a lifetime achievement award than anything else.   So save all that &quot;maturity and development&quot; folderol for the  black turtleneck gang at the coffee shop.<br />It's a great book, but it will  make you work.  If you want an obvious plot and themes that you don't have  to think about, maybe you'd be happier with Danielle Steele.
6305558167|5.0|This movie comes the closest of any theatrical rendition to capturing the grandeur and pageantry of Mallory's Le Mortre De Arthur.  From opening scene to closing credits, this is one of the most well-done movies ever  made.  Boorman is at his best in its direction &amp; the soundtrack is all  Wagner.  Who could ask for anything more?  Also, unlike many other Arthur  films (Such as First Knight) Excalibur addresses the entire scope of the  legend instead of just one aspect.  Fans will furthermore delight in seeing  a young Liam Neason and a performance of Patrick Stewart from his mid-life  years.  This film is, quite simply, excellent.
0684867621|4.0|I've read everything Stephen King's published, and I didn't think this one was a masterpiece.  The story was incredibly repetitive, and the main character was unbelievable.  I could feel the fear of being lost in the  woods, but after a while I didn't care anymore.
0064430227|5.0|I'm five again!!!  There are only two books that stand out in my memory as a very young child, and they are; &quot;Harold and the Purple Crayon&quot;, and &quot;The Velveteen Rabbit&quot;!  Harold is really YOU in a black and  white world, and you're on an amazing adventure!  Love this book, and have  added it to my children's library.
B00000JMG7|5.0|Rory Gallagher was one of the greatest blues/rock guitar players of all time and these discs really shine as one of his best releases.  Like Johnny Winter, Rory is unique because he was one heck of a slide AND flat pick  player.  Most players are proficient in one or the other.  Disc one is all  live from different dates and venues, disc two is all great studio stuff  from the early seventies, except the last track which is another live cut.  You searched for Rory on Amazon because you are either familier with or  heard of the legend.  Modern blues/rockers can take many lessons from this  material.  Buy this set.  You will thoroughly enjoy it.
B000002GJ7|5.0|This album was one of the best recorded, produced, written, etc... of all time. The first time I heard it I was blown away. If I was on a desert island and had to pick five CDs to have while I was stranded, this would  definitely be one of them! Nuno's guitar work is incredible!
0440213525|5.0|Mark and Ricky Sway were going into the woods to smoke when a car stopped near them in the woods.

0812589041|5.0|What can I say?  It was the best!  This is the book I read when I get stressed, and I've read it probably 40 times.
0780620828|2.0|This movie is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because I thought John Leguizamo was funny.
B000002JSP|5.0|A great late 70's album, nearly beyond reproach in terms of musicianship and overall slickness.  Although why they chose to include 'Carouselambra' instead of &quot;Ozone Baby' and 'Wearing and Tearing' I will never know.
0790729628|2.0|I watched this movie about a month ago.  I thought it was really slow at getting to the plot and it drug out between the action.  I think it could have been an excellent movie if it would have got my attention faster.  It  was worth seeing Harrison Ford in an early movie but that was basically it.
B00000DHRZ|4.0|I love this album; it was definately worth my money.  My favorite song is &quot;The Kids Aren't Alright.&quot;  The songs on here are all great but they are WAY too short.  That would mark it down a star because if you  really like a song, you'll want to hear it longer.  3 minutes and something  seconds is not long enough for all the songs on the album.  Other than  that, an awesome album
6305546797|5.0|I don't want to bore everyone with a long review of this DVD, All I will say is... BUY THIS VERSION!!! Not only is there absolutely brilliant picture and sound, but you get extras like trailers, commentary and other  cool extras! This VERY limited edition version of the film is far superior  to ANY other version that I have ever seen. With Halloween season just a  couple of short weeks away, these HOT copies of this film will be gone in  no time at all. Don't expect to see many if any at your local retailer, for  these are in a very limited and numbered quantity!! Stay scared!!!!
0684874350|5.0|What a breathtaking experience, reading 'Angela's Ashes.' This story of incredible anguish and suffering, related with such poignancy and humor, is so powerful, I truly feel changed having read it. Those ostriches who  panned it for being &quot;gross&quot; or &quot;depressing&quot; are  obviously not strong enough to take a peek at the truth once in awhile.  Look beyond the ugliness--there was life and faith and even laughter in  this story!
6305562474|5.0|The subtleties of the interaction between Close and Malkevich's characters makes for some great psychological pathology. A window into the minds of two exceptional sexual chess-players, this film depicts a classic battle of  the sexes but it's done with class and pathos. The weapons are the  head-games and the finesse with which each character wields them. <br />A film  to be studied rather than tossed aside as merely another movie about a  failed love-affair, one would do well to appreciate the havoc wreaked on  the minds of the two main characters by their own brilliance at mind-games.  Five stars not only because it is such a fine film, but because it's a lot  deeper than Amazon's reviewer claims. This film is not  &quot;mindless&quot;; if anything, it may be a bit TOO mindful: One has to  think to see what's just beneath the surface.
6304806434|3.0|it's a good movie but too bad without english subtile
B00000I9MK|5.0|It's pure pop perfection.  Trust all of the reviews, &quot;Tigermilk&quot; is wonderful.  I'm listening to it @ work right now.  But with this quintessential Belle &amp; Sebastian release tickling my auricles, work  becomes play.<br />This is by far B&amp;S's best album.  If you like  &quot;Sinister&quot; and &quot;Arab Strap&quot; you'll like this album much  better.<br />Personally, my fave song on the album is &quot;You're just a  baby.&quot;  Great sing-a-long song, in the tradition of the Beatles' best  songs.
0380018179|5.0|My favorate novel so far.  Amazing descriptions of both physical entities and emotions.  Smart and keen remarks about humanity that make me ponder.  I first read the book 4 years ago, and I liked it so much that I got the cassettes.  Especially for someone who doesn't really like to stare at the  pages for too long, I enjoy listening to it very much.  In short, I'm glad  I read it.
0425170055|1.0|I waited until Rainbow 6 came out in paperback and I'm glad I did, not just for the sake of my carpal tunnel but also for my wallet and sense of having my time wasted. Mr. Clancy should next try writing about Spanish  galleons and clipper ships: his long-windedness and tortured writing would  propel those ships along at great speed. In this latest epic macro-series,  Mr. Clancy has the world being threatened by those liberal tree-hugging  vegetarians who want to save the world by killing all but a few thousand of  the planet's residents. Do you hear faint strains of something like  &quot;we had to destroy the village in order to save it?&quot; The  incredulous plot has a team of scientists working for a major biochemical  company producing an ebola-based bioagent (does this sound familiar) that  will kill everyone on the planet. We have the usual cast of FBI, CIA, KGB,  MI6, MI5, SAS subjects and other assorted acronyms and numbers who are  blissfully unaware of this menace until the very last minute when our heros  rush to the rescue. I'm sure Mr. Clancy intended this book to be a  thriller, but it's far more enjoyable reading it as a farce. No mas.
B0000025HU|5.0|London Calling is the best album from 'The Only Band That Matters,' and that says a lot.  Instead of becoming cliche and just reproducing the same type of fast-paced punk songs that they wrote on their first two albums,  The Clash actually improved on two of the best punk albums of all time.   Every song on here is excellent (except for maybe Revolution Rock...I think  that one gets old) and they cover all sorts of musical genres (punk, ska,  reggae, rockabilly).  These songs can make me smile, get me ready for  battle, or make me a little melancholy.  And the hidden track!  Woe to  those listeners that turn off their CD player before Train In Vain comes  on.  London Calling is easily in my ten best albums of all time, and would  be the best ever if it weren't for those four fab lads from Liverpool.
0689504764|5.0|Many children's books are a torture for parents of toddlers to reread over and over as this age group requires. This is the exception. Our family of six wore out this book and I am ordering another copy for the up and coming  crop of readers. The older ones love to read it to the young ones and my  two year old has it memorized. We all love to add our own nuances to the  sing-song pattern to the story. I rarely buy books new (we haunt used book  stores) but I have bought this one new twice now. It must be everyone's  favorite- I have never seen it for resale. A definite must have for  childhood!
0060930349|5.0|This man is such a good historian, I loved the book even though there were mistakes.  (Are there such things as editors nowadays?)  Mr. Johnson may be excused for his worship of the current American Right--he did, after all,  grow up in socalist England which would have been enough to gag any  intelligent man.<br />Like many non-Americans, though, he fails to see (or  report) what &quot;conservative&quot; or &quot;liberal&quot; really means  here. He does, I believe, note that most Americans are really conservative  in the true connotation of the word.  The Constitution is so strong that  political issues really break down to the question of what to do with the  underclass that our attempt at freedom must, of necessity, create.  This is  very unplesant news to the electorate obviously. This causes both political  parties to take moral postures which, of course, have nothing to do with  the government and about which someone in a national office can do  absolutely nothing. (This is the &quot;for motherhood and against sin&quot;  platform of both parties.) This is safe and an increasingly ignorant  population is none the wiser.  One wonders why Mr. Johnson who loves  whipping up on the liberals--certainly an easy target--fails to mention  that the &quot;conservatives&quot; who howl greatly over government  interference in family life, were the rude and vocal supporters of federal  laws on divorce which suited their moral posture, and which, as they well  knew, would have been illegal and didn't have a chance in hell of being  passed.  How can a &quot;conservative&quot; want to gut the Constitution of  The United States?  What they are into conserving is the status quo which  is exactly what the liberals are into.  The argument is over how to appear  the most the moral in the  doing of this.  Our puritan culture is amazing.  (It's called cultural sucicide in other countries.) The wealthy are, as  usual, the most painfully aware that underclasses have a history of killing  off the establishment if treated too badly.  Ask the Spartans.<br />Ignorance  and moral posturing are our kings here, Paul, don't get caught up in it  yourself.  It does feel great one has to admit, but it won't stand the  light of logical thinking.<br />Every one should read this book and Paul  Johnson's other books.  The man has got the right idea: Look at the data  and get one's mind off the moral soapbox.<br />Tony Conwill
0152465030|5.0|I disagree with your &quot;reading level ages 9 - 12&quot;  There is such depth in this work that it is a book for all ages and conditions and the older one gets, the more one gets out of it.
0792840070|1.0|The box says that this video is a &quot;story of a love affair that breaks every sexual taboo.&quot;  I think not.  Mickey Rourke doesn't even take his shirt off until one-third of the way into the movie.  Except for an  occasional glimpse of Kim Basinger's boobs, there is nothing to see.  This  video has a long way to go before it breaks any taboos.  Dull, boring plot.
B00000AFFI|5.0|It's an insult to P.J.H. to compare her with Britney Spears, as a music fan from USA did in an earlier comment. If we had to do comparisons, try put Harvey on the same league with Patti Smith, Joni Mitchell, Courtney  Love, or at least Alanis M.
0780626478|5.0|I've seen this at least 6 or 7 times now and find something new to laugh about everytime I see it.  Suitable for all ages.  I am waiting for it to come out on consumer, rather than rental, price video to buy for several  friends without DVD players and for our video library at the pediatric  floor in our hospital.   Destined to become a comedy cult classic like UHF.
B00000JJSK|4.0|John Garcia has found yet another band to accompany his venomous vocals and the result is not dissapointing. While this is a departure from the style of music that Kyuss will forever be remembered for, Unida also rocks  with a honest and brutal intensity that fans of Kyuss will appreciate. If  you like buzzsaw guitar work and catchy, well crafted songwriting then  Unida is a band you'll be thankful for!
B000002GYR|5.0|This is the Greatest Album Of All Time From start to finish you can feel the pain and bittersweet joy. This is a must have.
0767836251|1.0|What I want to know is where were all the mature adults when all this machiavellian chicanery was going on...It reminded me of 'Lord of the Flies' another survival-of-the=fittest story about even younger kids in  another kind of jungle.Except they took no prisoners.Lord spare me from  teenagers like these.
B00000K19E|1.0|The dialogue was horrible.  The only thing worse was Reeves's actin
0792840852|5.0|The perfect movie musical, an affectionate look at the transition in American popular culture from vaudeville to silent film to talkies.  The direction is very stylized and exact - whoever finds this film  &quot;hammy&quot; should realized that it is a parody of film and acting  styles from the 1920's.  Those styles were hammy and this picture catches  them perfectly.  The choreography is breathtaking and danced sublimely.  Kelly and O'Connor are airborne, Reynolds is sweet, but the real wonder  here is the much-underrated Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont.  From her squeaky  Betty Boop voice to her Bette Midler walk (years before Bette did it), she  nails this role.  She is on the money, friends.  Perhaps her star didn't  rise because Judy Holliday was doing the same kind of thing in Hollywood at  the time, but this performance is stellar.  And look for an impossibly  young Rita Moreno as Zelda.
B000003S5H|5.0|I can listen to this album repeatedly and get completely lost in the intricately beautiful yet deceptively simple sounding music.  When I listen to a track like 'Ce Matin La' I really do find myself staring blankly into  space and daydreaming.  That particular track is one of my favourites it's  almost like a 1960's John Barry/Burt Bacharach instrumental hybrid. 'New  Star in the Sky' makes me feel like a child again.  The laughter of  children can be heard in the background while a synthesised voice gently  sings almost a lullaby.  All this over a Bowie-'Space Oddity' style  arrangement.  It sends shivers down my spine.  It is a masterpiece of  gentle restraint. Everyone should have this album.  It is the only modern  album I can be really enthusiastic about. If you enjoy this album you  should also try to obtain their EP: 'Premieres Symptomes' - equally  sublime.
6302517036|5.0|I usually laugh at vampire movies that try to scare you and are ridiculous (Lost Boys, etc) This movie is SOOOO realistic &amp; entertaining.  I've seen it now a hundred times, and still love it.  Chris Sarandon is the BEST  vampire I've ever seen (you almost wanna be one because of him) Cool, good  looking, yet scary !! I had the soundtrack on cassette but lost it.  I  REALLY want the CD (if anyone has it) but it's out of print. A must-see for  horror fans. And a great date flick. Terrible sequel, though.
0375707972|2.0|i've read all of the oprah books and this is the first one that i've been really disappointed by.  as some other reviewers mention, the storyline is unique and intriguing.  however, both the story and the characterizations  lack so much depth that not only do i not care about the protagonist, i  don't care how the story will end.  if the book was much longer than it  was, i probably would have put it down before finishing it.  of course, if  it was much longer, it may have contained the depth necessary to make it a  great book.
B00000EZTQ|5.0|When I first heard of the Halloween series it was when Halloween H20 came out.  I had never seen the original, but I did see Halloween 3 (which sucks out loud) but I never knew it was related to the whole series (in a sense  that it only bears the name Halloween).  I saw one preview for H20 and I  had to see it.  I saw H20 the 2nd week of August I loved it.  Halloween  came around and I bought the first 3 sequels (a big mistake since they were  Goodtimes and Video Treasure copies, but I have heard that the widescreen  version of this movie is a big improvement from their usual transfers).  I  loved the first movie, since then I've gotten all of the sequels and the  limited edtion plus the tv cut of Halloween II, the producer's cut of part  6 and the rough cut of H20--many people say the producer's cut of Halloween  6 is terrible because it's usually overdubbed--my copies are actually in  color, so I was lucky enough to find someone who had color copies.  One  major problem with Halloween II was the fact that Curtis cut her hair  shorter (if you watch Terror Train you will see how it looked in 81) that  was one BIG mistake they could have made a better wig! her hair was darkish  brown with blonde streaks and lighter tones of brown.  It was her choice to  cut it, but come on that's one cheap wig they could have tried a little  harder than that.  The wig looks Red not Brown like in the original.  I  like the whole movie though, remember how Laurie couldn't even talk to a  guy in Halloween?  Jimmy takes a liking to her and she's not shy at all I  like that whole scenario.  I also enjoy  the part where Jamie Lee does her  screaming I love when she murmurs &quot;help...&quot; then &quot;HELP  ME!!!&quot; and runs for the hospital door and reprises her dialogue from  the original...that to me is the best part.  All in all it's a great sequel  one of the best considering other cheesy sequels like (the Nightmare On Elm  Street series) which I do not like it's just stupid.  I'd have to recommend  you watch Halloween 4, 5 and H20, you will not be disappointed with any of  .  Halloween rocks!--JAMIE LEE CURTIS IS AWESOME :)
B000002AGN|5.0|This was my first Jazz CD and it remains one of my favorite records of any kind. Although it is superb through and through, my favorite track is &quot;Strange Meadowlark&quot;.  The sax on that track will give you  goosebumps.
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie is the best action movie I have ever seen. The plot is very interesting, and could sustain the film without the action, but wow, the action!! Scenes from the movie will be etched into your mind.  My second  favorite action sequences are in the movie &quot;Heat&quot; with Al Pacino  and Robert Dinero. If you liked that, you will love Matrix. Turn up the  volume and brace yourself for an adrenaline rush like never before!
B00000IBRI|4.0|I first saw Dario Argento's &quot;Creepers&quot; 5 years ago, and was vastly disappointed. It was the first Argento film I had ever seen, and for years I was not very interested in exploring his other works. Fortunately,  I have finally begun to fully appreciate his genius, and now not only am I  a huge fan of the director, but I am also a huge fan of what I had once  perceived as a dissappointing film. Phenomena is the same film as Creepers,  only with a different(and less appropriate) title and almost 30 min of  footage cut from Creepers. I remember only bits and pieces of Creepers and  therefore cannot compare what is missing from the US version, but I can say  this: Phenomena is one hell of a fun movie. Outrageous, ridiculously  violent, funny, bizarre, scary, and VERY well acted(particularly for an  Argento film), it is a must own fans of midnight movies and enjoyable  contemporary horror films in general. In addition to the film's  restoration, Anchor Bay, which is earning a terrific reputation for  rereleasing &quot;lost&quot; classics, gives the viewer a bundle of extras.  Among them: running audio commentary, two instrumental music videos, a  theatrical trailer, and a really great little interview between Joe  Franklin and Dario Argento. Not only that, but the transfer is truly  stunning. The sound is Dolby Digital 5.1, and the picture is stunning, with  bright colors and none of the murkiness so common on most of Argento's US  video transfers. A highly recommended chiller for any DVD afficionados with  a taste for horror.
0684874350|5.0|Angela's Ashes is filled with realism and authenticity.  The obvious focus of most readers is on the undeniable sadness, but the true inspriration lies in the message of hope that lies beneath that surface of despair.  Frank McCourt is a survivor and a brilliant storyteller. I laughed.  I  cried.  I couldn't put it down.
B000003N89|5.0|after I saw Diana last fall in a live concert at the Hunziker Mill near Berne, Switzerland, I was inspired by her voice and her personality. when I hear her CD's, I am back in the live concert again.
B00000BKDS|2.0|I'm not real crazy about Iron Maiden's first album. It's preety mediocre compared to next few albums. The better stuff is what follows this.
0385484518|5.0|I was attracted by the cover design of this book, and I was so wonderfully surprised by the content!  This book reveals that until we die, we can live a full life, and this is a great lesson of life.  I was taken by Morrie's  courage and his willingness to live every moment as it comes, and share his  feelings and insights with us.  Another book that I also picked up for its  cover, a striking picture of a firewalker is Working on Yourself Does'nt  Work, by Ariel and Shya Kane.  They gave me so many insights on how to live  in the moment, be more satisfied, in every moment of my life (and no need  for imminent death). Their book had a very profound and positive effect on  my personnal and professional life.  I highly recommend both books.  And  I  can't wait for the next great cover!
080013799X|1.0|I had heard this was the funniest movie of all time. I found it impossible, however, to approve of a film that implies that the weight of the African swallow is not well-known. King Arthur, being an all-round  Kingly sort of fellow, would never have been so wantonly ignorant of  ornithology, and to imply this was so is a gross insult. I also found it  grossly offensive to limbless knights, grenade-throwing monks, and other  minorities. I was watching with a three-headed ogre friend, and she  literally burst into tears at the stereotyped protrayal of her race. (Three  heads, that was a lot of tears to clean up.) Only utter lunatics would find  this movie funny. That includes everybody I've ever known, by the way,  except for a grumpy Scoutmaster and my dour auntie Prue.
B00000K2SC|5.0|The Matrix not only serves up fresh subject matter, its plot twists will keep you guessing. The special effects are overwhelming. Every actor turns in a believable performance in an unbelievable futuristic story. The  addition of good old fashioned action only proves to keep this film edgy.  Welcome Keanu Reeves back to the world of action. This movie also marks a  significant point in my personal life and will always be special for that  reason also.
0064400018|5.0|I think this book is wonderful!  I am an elementary education major, and read this book for my Media for Children class.  I'm glad I did!  This book is great for children in grades 3-5.  It's a good way to talk about the  pioneer days, and integrate it into an entire thematic unit. The  illustrations were few and far between, but they were simple and beautiful.  I definately recommend this book!
0380973642|3.0|The stories in this collection are disappointing more often than not.  The first story is terrific, and so are a few of the others, but not enough to make me glad I bought the book!  This surprised me because I thought Neverwhere was fantastic.
6300183211|5.0|Scarface is my favourite movie and one of the better drama movies ever made.Directed by Brian De Palma in 1983 is the story of a Cuban refugee,Tony Montana-Al Pacino-,who thaught that  he can take anything he  wanted.Al Pacino at his best performance, encarnates with very  peruasiveness Tony who begins as dish-washer, he becomes drugdealer and  from there  emperor of cocaine.The script, written by Oliver Stone,is very  different from  Ben Hecht's of 1932 Scarface with Paul Muni,although the  movie is based on it.Scarface was criticised for some very violent  scenes.  Al Pacino is impressive as he uses drugs and you think that he does it for  real.De Palma's work is excellent from the beginning to the end.He knows to  handle the camera with a wonderful way.One of the betters scenes is the one  that Tony looks up the sky and sees the sign-board &quot;THE WORLD IS  YOURS&quot; on an airship.Giorgio Moroder's synth score is superior and for  me the composer's best work.Don,t miss it.
0393312836|5.0|If I were an English teacher at Columbine High School (or any American high school, for that matter), I would put this book at the top of my students' reading list, even if I had to go to war with the school board to  do it. In addition to being an utterly captivating literary performance  from beginning to end, this book examines the problem of violence in  society in ways no writer has done before or since. Regrettably, I think,  most readers miss Burgess' point. A Clockwork Orange is not so much about  the evils of totalitarianism and the importance of free will as it is about  the clash of the &quot;evil&quot; state vs. the evil individual. In the  end, total government with all its prisons and behavior-modifying  technologies is no match for man's potential for total depravity. So who's  to blame for violence in society and what's the cure? Burgess offers plenty  of clues, and the possibilities for discussion are endless.
0767824571|5.0|Having studied the middle ages extensively, I agree with Arthur Ashe when asked a few years back what movie he felt best represtented the middle ages. His response was...&quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;. It is  as zany as some medieval texts. The DVD version has great picture and  decent sound. I am however disappointed with the fact that it is not  anamorphic as it has been advertised (several tests on different  equipment).  For zany fun, I would recommend a view. If you are in for the  anamorphic you will be disappointed. I can only hope that this problem can  be rectified at some point.
0140177396|5.0|I, like most, had to read this book for high school, and I must say, &quot;Thank you Mrs. Wiggin!&quot;  I love this book. It is so wonderful and touching.  I'm glad kids have to read it for school, because everyone  should read this book.
B00000JZC4|3.0|This one is reminiscent of the last album.  The first single is amazing, then you buy the cd and there's only 3 or 4 good songs.  The rest blow. There's nothing better than good Filter---it beats good NIN.  But medicre  NIN is way better than mediocre Filter, and half of Filter's material is  just that.   Maybe if he just released his great stuff one single at a time  a la Trip like I do, One---I mean those were just amazing friggin tunes!  Having said that:  Welcome to the Fold, Captain Bligh, Skinny, Take a  picture, Best Things---all good. The rest----eh! But again, Filter's best  compares with anyone!  I just wish he could make an entire cd of his best!
B000002U9W|5.0|Yeah, don't be surprised. Atom is PF best album. Here's why: you listen to Dark Side, Wish You Were Here or The Wall previously knowing (or expecting) they will be good! So you don't really MAKE your true opinion. It's like  imposed. The thing is that those albums are actually great! BUT... By now  you must have understood me. It's not the same magic. Atom is mysterious,  you have no idea whether you'll love it or hate it!! Beginning with the  cover: have any of you guys seen anything more bizarre than that? A cow  grazing! I have never. And I could not find one reference to a cow in the  music! Maybe any of you could... Now the songs: they're only five but don't  be fooled! A 26 song album (The Wall...) wouldn't have done better, believe  me. &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;, unique, magical, catching. The 24 minute  song works as LSD, takes you to places you'd never dreamed of. I always  travel to a medieval castle in the beginning and to early Japan, home of  the Samurais, by the middle of the song (you'll see why when you listen to  it). You guys must try it; REALLY amazing. &quot;If&quot; is a very soft  tune, similar to &quot;Pillow of Winds&quot; from Meddle. It sounds very  comforting after the ecstasy of the previous song (by now you're already  comfortably numb, hehehe). &quot;Summer 68&quot; is sung by Richard Wright,  it's the happy tune of the album. Very gentle, makes you sing along with  it. &quot;Fat Old Sun' is my second fav. The title suggests happiness,  although it's very melancholy. Here you'll find the characteristic  Gilmourish guitar solo. Very very beautiful. &quot;Alan's Psychedelic  Breakfast&quot;: I must admit I consider the album finished at &quot;Fat  Old Sun&quot;. &quot;Breakfast&quot; is too long for what it proposes: a  smirk in your face. At a first listen, not only a smirk, but a burst of  laughter. It's really funny, you'll see (funny is not the perfect  definition... I'd say it's funny because it's so so strange, out of  place...bizarre).<br />The richness of the 4 first songs and the other  aspects I mentioned in the beginning make this the best PF album. Maybe you  won't agree at a first analysis, but one time &quot;Atom Heart  Mother&quot;, the album, will hook you.
B000002U82|5.0|Absolutly the best album of the 90's no other artist holds a candle to &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; if you own one album this is it filled with passion and grief Pink Floyd reached the pinnical of artistic  expression here.
B00000DGUG|4.0|The first time I listened to the album, I was impatient. <br />I do not know what I was looking for, but I know that I was not in the right frame of mind to appreciate it.  That was my problem.  <br />I couldn't believe that an  artist could have created an album so amazing (JLP) and be a one hit  wonder.  So, I let the album play in its entirety a few times, as I hung  out in my room.  I let it become incidental, and then magically each song  began to grow a life of its own and the structure and flow of the album  became a lovely journey which I now take very often.
B000001EMW|4.0|I never would have thought that anyone would play Metallica on a cello. I myself am a classically trained pianist, and I delve into different styles of music, but Apocalyptica has given it such a sincerity that it sounds at  times like it was meant for the cello all along. This is a great CD, and  their second one is even better.
B000001FSR|5.0|Among my favorite CDs ever -- I have about 1000 CDs and this ranks in the top 10.  This is Tom Waits' tribute album to Frank Sinatra.  &quot;Straight to the Top&quot; is Waits doing Sinatra which is hilarious.  In general  though, great orchestration and instrumentation -- why more artists don't  exhibit this level of superior creativity surprises me as it is simply an  amalgamation of numerous musical influences.
6300214559|5.0|Whether you're a romantic, a historian, a lover of film, or all three, this movie will satisfy you to the core.  I never knew it existed.  I never knew Cary Elwes existed.  I discovered him a few weeks ago and am in the  process of viewing the all movies in which he appeared.  This film, by far,  is his shining star.  Both Helena Bodham-Carter and Elwes are perfect as  doomed, idealistic lovers.  The innocence with which they portray their  characters will make you weep throughout the film.  It will also most  likely make you sad to not have experienced the sort of love they share.   There are a few minor drawbacks:  first, you might do like me -- rewind the  tape again and again; secondly, the video is horribly priced so no one can  afford to own it for continued viewing.  Unfortunately, I'll probably spend  that much money in rental fees alone.
B000002MFN|4.0|I think this is her best album yet, shadowing even Ray Of Light. Forget her SEX escapade, that was a half baked attempt at pushing buttons which resulted in a bad career move.<br />Just listen to her bare her soul in this  album (tracks like Bad Girl and In This Life), and hear her experiment in  Secret Garden, Erotica and Waiting (lots of jazz, trip-hop stuffs).<br />And  if you listen close enough, you'd realise that the recording for this album  is quite unique. In all her songs, her vocals are layered on the tracks  several times. So you get to her a chorus of her singing. This technique  wasn't employed in the rest of her other albums.
0345377370|4.0|Considered the best spy novel ever written, this is a quick, bleak book. It is widely praised for its realistic portrayal of Cold War spycraft, and rightfully so. There's hardly any 007-style action, no gizmos, no babes,  just an elaborate, nasty plot. More or less makes all other Cold War spy  novels redundant in its efficient depicted of an old British spy making his  last big gambit before being retired. Tight prose and lots of tension.
B00000J8EK|3.0|The Chemical Brothers new album Surrender dissapoints.  The only danceable song on the whole album is Track #4 Orange Wedge...and even so this one is a slow groove.  The sound landsapes in these pieces are THIN and not at all  invigorating.
0393314804|5.0|You've seen the movie, now read the book (or vice versa). Despite the phantasmagorical nature the film adopts at times, the book is even more whacked out--in a good way-- not to mention rougher in many senses.  Although it flows chronologically, the novel is plotless, skipping from  vignette to vignette, told by a wide range of people. The main characters  from the movie are the main characters in the book, but there are a number  of stories narrated by more minor characters as well. This makes the whole  thing more impressionistic and loose, and of course, allows space for many  more entertaining stories. There are a few scenes that get really nasty,  such as a scene where Renton has sex with his just-dead brother's pregnant  wife in a bathroom after the funeral. The guys are also a fair bit older  than the movie makes them out to be, Begbie is a good deal nastier, etc...  It's actually rather amazing they found a movie in all the stories in the  book. In any event, don't be intimidated by the dialect and slang, it's  great fun once you get into it.
B000001IPL|5.0|I bought this CD a long time ago, when I was in seventh grade, because I liked the songs &quot;Self Esteem&quot; and &quot;Come Out And Play&quot;, the obvious radio singles that everyone liked.  I am now a senior in high  school and I still find myself haiving mad listening sessions with this CD.   It's punk rock, yet, it has that edge that just seperates it from all  other punk rock.  Every song is effective in their own way.  I have near  based my life on the lyrics of &quot;Nitro&quot;, &quot;Bad Habit&quot; is  just plain fun to drive to, &quot;Gotta Get Away&quot; reminds me that  people just might be after me, so on and so forth.  I would call this CD a  classic CD from the 90s generation, right up there with Nirvana's  &quot;Nevermind&quot;, Metallica's black album, Pearl Jam's  &quot;Ten&quot;, and Soundgarden's &quot;Superunknown&quot;.  I highly  recommend it.
630349255X|5.0|Baraka is available on Laser Disc, so I guess it cant be too long before we get it on DVD. I hope.
B00000DFTG|3.0|Tony Iommi's '90s work is so much in shambles that even this average live record, rehashing Black Sabbath's '70s glory, is a welcome treat.<br />None of these live versions can match the original studio versions.  Ozzy  Osbourne's voice is simply incapable of handling the insane material that  Black Sabbath recorded at its height (Ozzy sounds especially shot on  &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;).  Still, his legendary chaotic charisma  comes through, taunting the crowd on &quot;Iron Man&quot;, mumbling through  the nonsensical lyrics of &quot;Paranoid&quot;, and giving a truly scary  vocal performance on &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, still the band's most  chilling composition.<br />Something worth noting:  Bill Ward has never  sounded crisper, given the improved recording techniques of today, and  Iommi's guitars remain thunderous and thick.  Reasons enough for a Black  Sabbath fan to buy it.  As for others, this won't convert you to  Iommi/Osbourne/Butler/Ward unless you're already onboard.  So -- definitely  not the one to get if you're just starting to explore the musical legacy  that is Black Sabbath.
6304025831|5.0|I LIKED THIS MOVIE A LOT AND I THINK THAT JOE PESCI DOES A REALLY GOOD ACTING JOB WITH AND WITHOUT ROBERT DENIRO                                       TERIR
6304346107|2.0|This video had many more scenes in it that were in the book than the Gwenyth Paltrow version.  However, the halucinations by Emma were much distracting as were the character choices for Mr. Knightley, Miss Bates,  and Jane Fairfax.  Kate Beckinsale misses the point in Emma's dispair of  losing her governess and loses herself in la-la-land to dream up her  schemes.  Gwenyth at least looked thoughtful when she decided to help  Harriet, not some divine intervention scene as displayed in this version.   Mr. Knightley was awful looking, as was Miss Bates - she's supposed to be  old, but not ancient.  Miss Fairfax was too similar in appearance to Kate  Beckinsale, looks like they could have done a coin toss to equal each  other.  Frank Churchill played his part well, but it was hard for me to  believe his indifference between the two similar looking women as he  claimed Jane was too pale.  (What was Emma, then?).  Thumbs up to A&amp;E  for their efforts to bring the book alive, I wish they'd have done as much  for the characters.
6302293553|4.0|I think this movie deserves 5-stars, mind you.  The 4-stars refers more to my opinion of the movie now. Don't get me wrong...I love this movie with an ardent passion. I remember the first time I rented it with my brother (who  knew nothing about Python at that time and thus, suspicious)...and we  watched it together three times before returning it to the video store. We  felt like we were the first in our general kid-community to discover this  treasure of comedic cinema. But it is not the pinnacle of everything funny  ever. I may have thought so when I saw it the first time, but it doesn't  make me laugh (as much) anymore. Everything that occurs is expected and  every laugh is anticipated rather than a crazy Pythonesque surprise (like  it was the first time). I wish I could return to that first viewing when  everything was a shock and I was falling over from laughter. Movies lose  some of their power over you when you have every line memorized (even the  Directors Cut). Also: I fear that too many people think that this is what  Monty Python was, in total...and they don't get exposed to the  even-bigger-brilliance of Monty Python's Flying Circus (and Life of Brian  for that matter). Notice I don't mention Meaning of Life. Do not restrict  yourself to Holy Grail, rent everything Python (even Meaning of Life, just  for the experience) that you can get your hands on. If you get as addicted  to MPFC as you are to MP&amp;HG, you may not go back.
0671578278|4.0|This book covers Miles learning about romance and politics.  It is fast paced, the character development is full and rich and consistant with other books about Miles' World.  The Story line keeps you hopping from one area  to another.  The book teachs us a lot about ourselves and our current world  even though the book is set in the future on another planet.
6305363668|2.0|The first &quot;Blade Runner&quot; was so good, especially with the story being told by Harrison Ford.  The director's cut did not include this and much of the story is missed.  Also, there was a scene with a  unicorn...quite bizarre.  If you get the original motion picture in stock,  let me know as soon as possible because this one (the Director's Cut) was a  waste of money.
B000002NAK|5.0|It's great.  Madonna did an excellent job.  Everyone on this cd did a great job.
B00000G3PA|5.0|We've seen this DVD over and over. Kids love it. It's been money well spent! Sure it's not the most believeable story but it's Hollywood at it's best! If you want realism go to work! If you want to be entertained watch  this video!
0792838912|2.0|It is not that Rourke and Basinger dont give good performances.  Rourke is very believable as the perverted, rich exec and Basinger good as the art dealer who is disgusted yet strangely attracted to Rourke's twisted changes  in behavior.  I think what is lacking is the identification that the viewer  makes with at least one character.  Unless your a sadist or masochist or at  least interested in that sort of thing you wont be able to identify with  either of the leads.  There may be some identification with Basinger as  being so lonely or desperate for change in her hum drum life she puts up  with Rourke's wierd and unerotic approach to sex.  The two highlights of  the film are Basinger's striptease and at the end of the film when she  decides she has had enough of Rourke.  The end is the most understandable  part of the film.  Still interesting and worth checking out but not the  best from either Mickey or Kim.  Some trivia:  Jaqueline Bisset was asked  to do Basinger's role but she didnt want to expose herself to that degree.
B000002ADT|5.0|As a preface to my comments, I have never ever been a fan of jazz. One of my best friends listens to jazz and I have generally despised everything of his I've listened to. The jazz I have heard before just seemed like a lot  of sound and motion going nowhere with no purpose to it. I have always been  intrigued, however, by what I've read about jazz as an art-form, and I have  heard a lot about the \\"coolness\\" of Miles Davis, so I finally  took a deep breath and bought \\"Kind of Blue\\" 2 or 3 days ago. I  bought this album because of the customer reviews, so now I am  reciprocating. I have been blown away ever since I got this album! I  haven't listened to anything else. I am a graphic designer/programmer  working out of my home so I am alone all day listening to music while I  work. I have listened to this album countless times in a row, and am  listening to it now as I write this review. When I try and put my other  music in (Steve Earle, Lyle Lovett, Bruce Springsteen) it seems so flat  that I take it out and put Miles back in, and when I am not listening to it  I can't get it out of my head. I'm sure this euphoria will wear off, but  for now I am loving it! I have just ordered another Miles album \\"In A  Soft Way\\" and am anxiously awaiting its arrival.     I wish I could  properly convey how much of a jazz fan I was not, and how much I really  like this album. I still consider myself a jazz antagonist, referring to  the other stuff I've heard, but I am a new-born Miles Davis devotee!
B000001FSR|5.0|Though most critical acclaim aimed at Tom Waits focuses primarily on 1985's Rain Dogs or Grammy-winner Bone Machine from '92, the album in between is, in my humble opinion, not only Waits' best, but one of the best  from anyone at any time.  Waits can be so ecclectic at times that it comes  at the sake of continuity, but Franks Wild Years walked the line as no  other album did.  17 songs of pure genius from the wild and aggressive Hang  on St. Christopher to the glorious final 3 tracks, any one of which would  have made the album worth the fifteen bucks.
0440224764|3.0|Grisham kept you roped in until the final pages when you were left fully disappointed.  I wonder if he was planning a sequel to this nove or possibly a movie deal.  Those of you who have read the book may agree that  the ending was a bit unbelievable. Nonetheless it was a great story, Ijust  didn't care for the ending.
044022425X|4.0|-The Drums is not Diana's best work so far. It was a little slow paced and rather predictable. The character development of Brianna and Roger was weak and not as good as Dragonfly in Amber. They even acted stupid sometimes  like when Brianna tried to force John Grey to marry her and acting as if  she knew Jamie very well. Nope and I almost don't even care about what  would happen to them. I also thought Jamie's treatment of Roger after his  rescue was extreme. After all, it was Jamie that got Roger into the mess.  I'm looking to the 5th installment in 2000 and hope that it will be better  constructed and as great and steamy as the other books.

0684800713|2.0|As other reviews have stated, the descriptions of the characters' travels are interesting, but as we search for Hemingway's point, we are disappointed as no clear point is made.  Are we to compare Lady Brett to  the bullfighters?  Jake Barnes and other men to steer and bulls?  If  meaninglessness is the point, then I suppose it was made.
B0000024TT|5.0|I discovered the album when I was in high school and it allowed all that teenage angst to emerge and be comforted. <br />Since that time I have explored other Cohen releases as well as his poetry books and novels, but  nothing surpasses this release. <br />If you are new to Mr. Cohen's work, this  is a &quot;must have&quot;. It is lyrically rich, like a warm soothing cup  of Expresso. Drink up!

B000002H8F|5.0|Mat Snow notes that &quot;Its air of queasy jocularity is echoed elsewhere on the album, such as Is She Weird?-Is she weird?/Is she white?/Is she promised to the night?/And her head has no room. What can they mean? one  wonders; what on earth are they on?&quot;<br />Obviously Matt was either born  before 1965 or after 1975.   When I was a college youth, graduating in  1990, there was a &quot;click&quot; that liked depressing music - ie the  Cure (don't hang me - I am a huge Cure fan) that I have heard today on MTV  described as &quot;gloom rock&quot;.<br />It was cool to be wierd.  It was  cool to wear black, worship death and the dark side, etc, and this group,  in their mind, had it all worked out,the meaning of life, and other similar  meaningless attributes.  Naturally those of us who were &quot;normal&quot;  called them the &quot;psuedo&quot;intellectuals - so busy in the depths of  existance they missed the actuality of it.<br />So, by saying is she wierd, is  she promised to the night, does her head have no room they are simply  describing a social group that was quite prevelent in the United States in  the late 80's, early 90's.<br />Again, the misinformation of youth, and how  music is fit to its current social standards.  Oh, and the Pixies rock.   Saw them live in 1990 in Chicago.
B00000J7A2|5.0|Meet the Beefheart!  It's like two blues bands playing different songs at the same time to see who can be the nastiest.  The Captain's love of The Stones can definitely be heard on tunes like &quot;ZigZag Wanderer&quot;,  and &quot;Call On Me&quot;. This is a great stepping stone record if you  love the blues and want to get to know the Captain. The re-master sounds  amazing.  I almost miss the hiss.
B00000J2KT|5.0|too often terms like 'great' are attributed to popular or even just competent films which don't deserve anything close to such praise.  this is not one of those films.  full metal jacket is an experience; approach it  with intelligence and sensitivity and you cannot help but be changed. buy  this movie, watch it, and walk away different.
0784011176|2.0|This is an excellent, haunting film, but unfortunately the DVD transfer is poor; there is a lot of black in the movie, and just about all of it exhibits MPEG artifacts to a distracting extent.
0953104907|5.0|Melvyn Hiscock has a unique gift not only in building electric guitars but also in his writing. From the very first pages the old mysticisms surrounding electric guitars are dispelled. Leo Fender kept thing simple  and how many of his fuitars are sold today?  Melvyn's approach is the same  by keeping each step simple.  The book is packed with excellent photographs  and diagrams and his section on electrics is brilliant, no schematics just  again simple step by step instructions.  Anyone who buys this book will  without doubt, in a versy short space of time build and play their own  guitar, and if they are anything like me get bitten by the building bug.  Thank you Melvyn Hiscock.
630512065X|5.0|This video did a wonderful job of capturing the magic of the broadway show CATS.  In some ways it's better than live (the sound quality is certainly better than in most theaters, and the close-ups of the cats' faces are  extra special).  My children and all their friends adore this video. It is  the most-watched video we've ever owned, and my son and daughter are both  huge Lloyd-Webber fans, because of this video.
B000002U82|5.0|This album is probably the true turning point where music, poetry, art are all combined into someting awesome. David Gilmour's solo on Time is one of those moments in rock &amp; roll where you simply know perfection has been  attained. The only song I can compare musically with it in terms of a  super-complex layered guitar sound is on Stairway To Heaven. A definite  must have for island/desert stranded state.
B000000WZ4|5.0|Since first hearing Violator last year, I've purchased several DM albums but always concluded that Violator was their best, along with their earlier pre-Black Celebration material.  I held off buying &quot;Ultra&quot;  thinking I'd be disappointed with the direction they'd taken their music  in.  However, upon seeing it going cheap in a bargain bin, I had to get it  just to see what it was like, fully expecting to hate it.  To my surprise,  I didn't hate it. . .I loved it.  As with Violator, I had to listen a few  times to really appreciate all the songs, but after doing so I'd have to  say this ranks right up there with Violator.  &quot;Home&quot; is the best  cut, followed closely by &quot;The Bottom Line&quot; and  &quot;Insight&quot;.  The singles, &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; and  &quot;It's No Good&quot; are next best. The rest of the songs fill out the  album, but I feel if any of them were removed it would detract from the  listening experience.  <br />If you're still stuck in DM's past as I was, give  &quot;Ultra&quot; a listen and instead of looking back, you'll be looking  forward to their next album.
B000002UJQ|5.0|So exceptional on every level that it's hard to believe it can be topped.  <br />They have no contemporaries.  Radiohead is so much better than what's out there, that by comparison, even the Tier I bands - Foo Fighters,  Midnight Oil, Smashing Pumpkins, etc.. - sound lame.
B000005ALN|5.0|You would have to have an ounce or two of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of these musically creative and lyrically innovative songs. Also a round or two of being knocked in the head with life's harsh  realities would help to understand them. I played this album in my office  and was surprised nonetheless that several people asked to take it home to  listen to it or just plain went out and bought it.    This is not however a  young Wham style party album but a very stimulating reflection of life and  living after the all night party scene but well before the nursing home.
B000001ESN|4.0|This is the first in a trio of very different, but great early-'80s-albums. It's a good mixture of radio-friendly tunes, longer and more experimental pieces, and even a ballad, &quot;Different Strings&quot;,  which is one of my favourite Rush songs. I think Rush's ballads like the  mentioned one, &quot;Losing It&quot; or &quot;Bravado&quot; were always  underrated. Apart from the music, Neil's lyrics were becoming better and  better.<br />But I have to complain seriously about the playing time and the  number of tracks this album contains! The release of the &quot;Rush  Remasters&quot; could've or should've been the chance for putting some  extra tracks onto the discs in order to fill out a whole CD's space. What  about live performances, single b-sides, studio outtakes, interviews, or  even some CD-ROM material? Just squeezing a transparent tray into the CD  case and slightly refreshing the artwork isn't enough, guys!
B00000I07Q|5.0|What else can I say
B000002UW1|5.0|I lost any objectivity I thought I had about this band after hearing &quot;Document&quot;.  It is quite simply one of the landmark recordings of the century if you will excuse the hyperbole.  The cult status REM had  achieved via Murmur and Reckoning, and later enhanced with Fables (very  under-rated) and LRP, was blown apart with this record.  Warner Brothers  came calling and the rest is history.<br />For you second generation (last 10  years) fans of the band, do yourself a favor and get  &quot;Document&quot;.<br />Picking the best REM record is like choosing  between which of your kids you like best . . .but this one is probably  their best pure rock record. It is also one of the best rock records ever  made.
B00000ADG2|5.0|How can you have anything but positive comments for Ms. Hill's first cd without the Fugees? After the first time I listened to it, I knew this was going on permanent status on my CD player. Every track is the bomb and even  though I don't agree with her religious beliefs, I am very proud that she  has the courage to speak about what she believes in with conviction and  force. She's a powerful woman and this is a great CD.
B000002MIY|2.0|&quot;Kamakiriad&quot; was reviewed to death by critics, and even every German newspaper or music magazine I know, had to write down some thoughts about this album. I think &quot;Kamakiriad&quot; is only a mediocre  follow-up to the great &quot;Nightfly&quot; and isn't worth the press-hype  at all. It suffers from songs that sound far too similar, and especially  the nerve-rackingly sharp drums aren't varied. The arrangements are too  overloaden, and the songs are cold, hectic and sterile. Certainly I feel  that there's a lot of work and perfectionism in this record, but there also  should be a minimum of humanity in these futuristic surroundings!
078323077X|1.0|The Jackal is credited to the same writer, Kennth Ross, who did the screenplay for the vastly superior Day of the Jackal. Either he couldn't write as convincing a story the second time around or the remake suffers  because the original was directed by a really competent director, Fred  Zinneman. Except for the gunfire scenes, the movie is uninteresting; the  clever tricks and techniques the original Jackal used to escape detection  become hackneyed and unconvincing in this remake. In fact, the whole  premise is absurd. A cannon in the back of a minivan? Give me a break.  Perceptive viewers will note that the target of the assassin is the First  Lady of the United States who in this movie is a blonde. We know from Die  Hard with a Vengeance that Bruce Willis doesn't like Hillary Clinton; here  he gets to attempt to kill her, I guess. <br />More phoniness: Richard Gere  tries to do an Irish accent and nice location scenes filmed in what is  obviously the Montreal subway system are stupidly relabled with signs for  the Washington, D.C. metro, and those Washington, D.C. signs aren't even  accurate. Didn't we have enough of these phony Washington, D.C. sets in Die  Hard II where they planted a church at Dulles Airport and used phones  labeled &quot;Pacific Bell&quot;?<br />Save your money on this rip-off  stinker. Instead watch the original Day of the Jackal for a really  interesting battle of wits between the assassin and the police forces  hunting him.
6300214184|5.0|It is pretty special for a movie to last this well and to get better with each viewing.  The music from the 80s is great.  The plot is an inspiration.<br />The next time you watch it, enjoy the work of the  cinematographer in composing the scenes and lighting them.  I appreciated  the decision to set the movie in Pittsburgh, and then making sure that the  city plays a starring role.<br />Bravo.
0964385619|5.0|Here's the information which will show you why the rich are rich and the poor are the poor. The best thing you can do for the poor is to not be one of them. This book will highlight those principles practiced by the rich  and what the poor are doing wrong. It is a book of freedom: financial  freedom. Education is very important, but financial education and  information is even more important, that is, if you ever want to not have  to be concerned about money!
B000002LK1|3.0|When this album was released, it was clear that DM wouldn't be a major force in contemporary synth- and alternative-rock music any longer. Obviously, it became the other way round, as DM claimed grunge-rock bands  like Pearl Jam be an influence on their subsequent album &quot;Songs of  Faith and Devotion&quot;! Listening to &quot;Violator&quot; you will notice  that DM didn't pay attention to evolving trends in the late '80s and relied  on slick, radio-friendly produced songs. This is a poor statement from a  band who influenced even techno musician like Derrick May with the harsh  electro beats of their mid-'80s album like &quot;Some Great Reward&quot;!  Nevertheless I like some tracks, &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;, &quot;Policy  of Truth&quot; and &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; (peaking at #2 in the  German charts) are among DM's most accessible and enjoyable songs. If you  are only keen on the hit singles contained on this album, I would  seriously(!) recommend you to buy the CD-Single releases. There are some  interesting remixes on them, and even previously unreleased tracks. But  &quot;Violator&quot; remains one of DM's weakest album.
068483605X|5.0|This book is very good and I could read it again and again.  Everyone should read this book.
B00000GBHA|5.0|Rodriguez has been a household name in South Africa since the early 70's. The album Cold Fact has become a cult classic in South Africa, but unbelievably Rodriguez is still unknown elsewhere (except maybe in  Australia, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, and now Sweden!). He is never mentioned  in any music magazines, rock encyclopedias or any other publications on the  history of Rock. As one news headline said during the 1998 South African  tour: &quot;American Zero, South African Hero&quot;.
B000002WE9|5.0|My review was very good . I enjoyed it very much we need mor like it. There little I could say but it was good.
B00000JGOH|5.0|Obviously those viewers who believe this movie is simply a &quot;boink-fest&quot; (and believe that Romeo and Juliet itself was simply about &quot;lust&quot;) have never fallen deeply, madly, insanely,  passionately in love. I hope it happens for you someday. Then maybe you'll  &quot;get&quot; this film.
031286504X|5.0|I spent four years of my life searching for this book when most of Richard Matheson's works went out of print.<br />I originally became a fan after putting together this prolific and influential writer's various pieces of  fiction. From 'The Incredible Shrinking Man' to inspiring the movie  'Somewhere in Time' to his work on the TV show, 'The Twilight Zone',  Matheson is a giant of speculative fiction.<br />'I Am Legend' offers a  claustrophobic vision of the last man on earth and his daily battles  against the vampire hoard who wish to consume him. Filled with some taught  moments, the book drifts a little at points but it's the tangents that  often become so compelling in Matheson's work. All in all, a wonderful  read.
B000002UUX|5.0|This is the pinnacle of Megadeth and the pinnacle of Heavy Metal. Every song is a classic.
0800177177|5.0|We all know the name, the story, the book. And this film? I think it's fluent and graceful, filled with actors delivering some fine performances. Especially Gary Oldman. His performance as Count Dracula is nothing but  brilliant, and Winona Ryder does her part as the lost love. One let down is  a stiff and poor performance by Keanu Reeves, but that minor stab isn't  enough to hurt this film. Watching it on the big screen, the film dragged  me in and didn't let go. The costumes, the setting, it's all wonderful.  Watching it on a small screen just wasn't the same. But being a sucker for  first impressions...I love it none the less. Definitly one of the great  vampire movies of all time.
B00000I9MK|5.0|&quot;Tigermilk&quot; is a near masterpiece
B00000I8NC|5.0|This disc and band is one of the most amazing finds of mine in recent years.  I can not get over the amazing emotional intensity with which this band plays.  The musical crests that are reached with this c.d. are  amazing, and the field recording on BBF3 is the most intense rant I have  ever heard.  This album beats any pre-millennial paranoia album out there  (Busta Rhymes, death metal, etc...).
078322706X|5.0|Everything about this movie is beautiful, not the least of which, is Brad Pitt.  There was more than one scene where he literally took my breath away.  The romance is so subtle like the old time movies, the love scene  was elegant.
B000003N7G|3.0|I am not really a jazz fan, but I bought this after taking a jazz class in college.<br />Putting aside the spiritual theme and the &quot;John's Gift to God&quot; comments, I just want to comment on the instrumental music  itself.  I always get the distinct feeling that it is just too repetitive  (in the title track, for instance, that repeated four-note theme just  starts getting monotonous), and a lot of the songs don't really end up  going anywhere.  I have a hard time with this style.  It just sounds like a  bunch of notes, nothing that I would term &quot;catchy,&quot; nothing to  latch onto and really remember after it's all done -- which is something I  really like about the Dixieland, cool, and Swing styles of jazz music.   <br />I start thinking that if this instrumental music had been representing  any other theme than Coltrane's so-called spiritual awakening, the album  would not have gained as much respect.  Taking the music alone, as  instrumental jazz music, I have to admit that I grow weary of it fast.
B000002L99|5.0|Van Halen had always been one of the best rock bands arounds. A new lead singer? No problem, if it's Sammy Hagar. The music did change, and it's a good thing, because Van Halen needed to work into the 90's. What a way to  introduce a new lead singer because this album is perfect! I'm surprised  the song &quot;5150&quot; wasn't played on the radio, it is a great  rocker!!
0679601686|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is an all time classic of a liberal women with a compex mind and a lust for life. The uncharted chivalry was remarkable making this my all time favorite book
6305470464|5.0|I am a great fan of Gillian Anderson and she was the main reason why I wanted this movie. And I was not disappointed. The opposite actually. Great cast!Jon Stewart, Gena Rowlands, Sean Connery and Angelina Jolie was superb  and Gillian, well I am loss for words. I loved the way the storyline was  told and how everything was puzzled together in the end. If you want an  experience that goes beyond all the high technology movies that are such  big hits this summer, this movie gives you all you need! And the fact that  Gillian Anderson is in it makes it even better. Can't wait to see more from  her!
B00000K19E|5.0|This is the type of movie that really makes you think about what's real &amp; what's all in your head.  There is violence, yes, but those that say it was made just for the violence obviously must not have been able to  follow the plot.  Very thought provoking &amp; a GREAT movie.  Saw it in  the theater twice &amp; already have it pre-ordered on DVD.
B000007R0S|5.0|This CD is great in pro-logic, but is absolutely amazing in DTS 5.1! If you have a DTS system you must have this CD. Five stars all the way! *****
B00000IAU3|5.0|I picked up this CD because of &quot;Here With Me&quot; and now am completely addicted to the rest.  Although her voice (at first) seems a bit young/amateurish, you are soon captivated by her beautiful voice, music and  incredibly thought-provoking lyrics.  If you like female vocalists whose  lyrics are meaningful, contemporary and clear enough to understand (and  sing to!), you MUST get this CD.  She's awesome, you won't be disappointed.
0486650677|5.0|I'm about to take a course in analytical mechanics next year. The teacher is rumored to be horrible. It's a good thing I have this book!
B0000025YM|2.0|Fans from Judas: this record has some classic Juadas material, very, very good: &quot;The Sentinel&quot;, &quot;Frewheel Burning&quot; and &quot;JAwbreaker&quot;, for example. But it is definitely not their best  effort!. PLease, listen to &quot;BRitish Steel&quot;, &quot;Screaming for  Vengeance&quot;, the soft &quot;SIn After Sin&quot;, and their ultimate  metal masterpiece, &quot;Painkiller&quot;. In none of this records are the  digitalized and monotonous drums used in &quot;Defenders&quot;, the band  are not tranvested into glam. Listen to it and never say again that  &quot;Defenders&quot; is the best Judas album, please!!!!
6305013578|1.0|Metropolis is one of the greatest movies of all time.  Visually, it is still ripped off almost on a daily basis.  Unfortunately, this DVD version is agonizing to watch.  I lasted about 20 seconds and the disc was stored  away.  Hopefully someone will release a copy with both  &quot;traditional&quot; and Georgio Moroder soundtracks.  A perfect  opportunity to utilize the capabilities of DVD
B00000263T|2.0|The last &quot;acceptable&quot; Accept album was &quot;Balls to the Wall&quot;, released before this &quot;Metal Heart&quot;. I think some people who reviw here dont know that 5 star-rating should be used to a  classic rock, inside a bands career and style. &quot;Metal Heart&quot;  paved the way for the downfall of the band, being extremely commercial.  Look at the songs titles: &quot;Screaming for a Love Bite&quot;?!! Whats  that? If you wanna know Accept, buy &quot;Breaker&quot;, &quot;Restless and  WIld&quot;, &quot;Balls to the Wall&quot; or &quot;Im a Rebel&quot;.
B000002IHU|5.0|While Ratt's debut album is also a favorite of mine, I believe that this album is their best. Not one bad track on it. Closer To My Heart is my favorite song. I never in 10+ years have gotten tired of it. If you like  80's metal this album is a must have.
B000002AGN|5.0|Questo CD  stato rimasterizzato in modo eccellente e regala delle emozioni notevoli. Grande Dave! E' un ottimo acquisto.
B000006U44|5.0|This CD is astonishing. Kate Bush shrieks her way into your heart, singing about her period, insest, dead lovers, everything!!! She was 17 when she recorded this album, but it's very adult, feminine and powerful! The music  is smart, fun, spine-chilling and humorous. Nobody does it like Kate. Tori  Amos tries and tries and tries, but stands as a modern day reminder that  there is no one like Kate Bush! BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
6304007523|5.0|this is no doubt the best movie i have ever seen.  if you haven't seen it then get it, if you have seen it, see it again.  i think everybody in america should own all of the Rocky movies.
B000002U9E|5.0|I cannot find the words to say what an amazing album this is! Kate Bush manages to fit two albums on one 13-song CD. The first 5 songs act as a driven diary on different kinds of love while the next 7 tunes chronicle a  woman's night in the water as she fights to stay alive. Brilliant!  &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot; is pure alt-pop while &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;  teeters on new wave-classical. Throughout the CD, Kate flirts with  different musical styles, merging them into new, mystical forms.  &quot;Under Ice,&quot; a song about drowning, is somber yet effective, rock  and folk, insane and calm. The whole CD is one dramatic track after  another! Just hearing the absolutely bombarding song &quot;Waking The  Witch&quot; is reason enough to snatch this album up!! A grande experience.  I recommend this album to everyone! A classic!
0812589041|5.0|This book has gotten me through some very tough times in my life, and I always think of what Ender would do if he was me.  I've read it several times, but after a while, it does tend to lose it's emotional effect.  This  book best relates to teenagers, I don't know about the rest of you, because  I haven't gotten there yet.  BUY THIS BOOK!
B000006MS3|5.0|&quot;The Dreaming&quot; is by far Kate's most daring effort. Made in 1982, Kate obviously was way ahead of her time , musically, lyrically, everything. What Tori Amos attempts to achieve on her &quot;Boys For  Pele&quot; album, Kate achieves in half the time and with greater panache.  The music is dramatic, emotional, raw, in your face, a strggle of a soul in  turmoil. This is the album I heard that convinced me that Kate is the best  female singer/songwriter in all the music industry. Keep your Toris and  your Sheryls and your Alanises. Kate Bush is the real thing, through and  through. Every song on this CD paints its own portrait. Truly a work of  art! However, lazy listeners need not pick up this fine collection. Kate  makes you work for the meaning.
B000002U9L|5.0|I'm 17, but I love the movie.  So, naturally, I am going to love the CD.  I don't care if he is old enough to be my dad, David Bowie is HOT!!!! JOHN MOTLEY MOREHEAD PANTHERS ROCK!
0425170349|5.0|Rainbow Six was a real page-turner.  I didn't want it to stop!  I cant wait for Clancy's next book just to see if he can top this one!                                    -PsiStorm00
0553213105|5.0|This book has got to be the best I have ever read. It was on the requirements list for my literature course at school, but I found it so compelling that I finished reading it at home! I especially loved the  ending-it's so romantic! I also congratulate Jane Austen's sense of humour  and her ability to create such diverse characters that seem so realistic. I  thought Mrs. Bennet's empty-headed, foolish character was the funniest  &amp; so incredibly contrasting to that of the cool-headed one of  Mr.Bennet. All in all, I truly recommend this book for everyone that loves  to read classical romantic-comedies...don't be discouraged by it's  length-by the time you're finished, you'll be wishing it was longer!
0790738139|2.0|A good enough little movie.  Perfectly adequate in all ways, except for the utter tedium that sets in whenever Kevin Spacey appears on screen.  Strange that this has become acclaimed as some sort of masterpiece.  I  can't agree.  It is merely an amusing little movie that entertains for a  couple of hours.  Sad that that is enough, in the late 1990s, to confer  classic status on a movie.
B000002H8F|5.0|i adore the pixies, my favourite sound on this one is 'ALL OVER THE WORLD', all the songs have a 'spacey', 'eerie' feeling, also like Rock Music
B00000JZIK|1.0|I knew immediately what was going to happen.  After I saw through the Big Surprise, I could only sit back and marvel at Kevin Spacey's somnambulistic performance (didn't they have any coffee on that set?).  Lots of sound and  fury, signifying absolutely nothing.<br />There are much better movies out  there.  Look a little harder, you'll find one.
B000001GXJ|4.0|Overall a great recording  -  Abbado leads us into the world of characters caught by their intrigues.  Freni is probably the best Amelia on CD with a beautifully sung aria.  It still is a second choice:  the perfect  characterization of Simone and Fiesco still remains the couple Gobbi /  Christoff.
6305428298|5.0|A classic. This loses nothing in the translation from the stage play. Jane Horrocks at her best and thoroughly recommended
6301963717|5.0|Dark and powerful story of Irish gansters.  It's interesting to see a gangster film that centers around an ethnic group other than Sicilians.  It's fresh and fascinating.  The underrated Gabriel Byrne and Marcia Gay  Harden turn in stellar, complex performances and John Turturro has a  chilling moment when he reveals how much of his supposed weakness is really  manipulation.  With this piece, the Coens add another chapter to their  stark look at America.  From Fargo to Miller's Crossing to Arizona, the  Coens have revealed our sordid secrets through bleak, realistic  storytelling and innovative direction.  They know us.
0887307396|5.0|Excellent summary of the strategic planning efforts of 20 Fortune 500 companies.  The strategic plans of these &quot;visionary&quot; companies are compared to the strategic efforts of twenty successful companies, but  clearly not visionary companies.  Real nuts and bolts look; useful to  managers at all levels in both profit and non-profit organizations.  More  concerned with helping the reader establish guidelines and processes for  creating a visionary company.  Less concerned with abstract theory and  scholastic wordsmithing.  This book has been extrememly helpful to me in my  work as planning officer at a small Ohio college.  Great introduction to  the importance of developing planning processes.
B00000J7JO|5.0|Too many early 90's band have failed to make an album worth listening to since '93. You know a band is good when they evolve with time. Blood Sugar Sex Magic was a great album, but thank god the Red Hots have never tried to  duplicate it. Rather, they continue to grow and change while still  retaining that certain something that is the essence of what makes the Red  Hots a stellar band. I think this album is their best to date. My other CDs  feel neglected--I have been listening to Californication non-stop since I  first bought it. Californication is the first album that completely  explores and exhibits the complete range of Anthony Kiedis' voice and  singing style. In the past, I thought some of their songs excellent, and  others only ok. On this album, however, they have finally reached their  full potential. Every song is like a finely tuned engine--it not only runs,  it purrs!
078401020X|4.0|Sharon Stone at her sexiest simulated sex best.  Borders on soft core porn in parts.  See her Sliver too to see that she knows what she's doung when it comes to this mode of acting. I found the movie pretty good although the  ending is somewhat confusing to me. Still, it has no Hollywood happy  ending.<br />I read somewhere that these roles embarass her somewhat.  They  are what have made her though, and she has full equals although you might  try some early Kathleen Turner in Crimes of Passion and Body Heat. Meg  Tllly in Bound, and of course, classic and classy Melanie Griffith in Body  Double.
B00000G6QK|5.0|i collect jazz and fusion from the 70's and this is always near my cd player. great tunes &amp; chops-  a very addictive recording.
0553208845|5.0|Siddhartha is one of the few books that I have read in my life that have really stuck with me.  This is not an overly descriptive book, but Siddhartha's journey doesn't necesitate and complex description, which is  one of the points of the book.  The world can be simple, if you look at it  properly.  The story reads more like a parable than a novel, which  exemplifies its spiritual content.  This story will make you think.  About  this, that, and everything interrelated.  This is not a story to breeze  through quickly, but to reflect on.  This is book for anyone spiritual, and  openminded.  If you feel that is you, please do humanity a favor and pick  up this book.
6303022901|5.0|I watched this movie with like 12 of my girlfriends.  We're all chinese.  After that we just couldn't stop talking about how the movie reminded us of things our own mothers would do.  It was quite an experience.  I know I'm  biased in my views because I'm chinese.  But it shouldn't take away  anything from this well made and well acted movie.  i've already watched  this movie 10 times, 3 times in the theatre, 7 times on video.  :-)
0679745203|4.0|Poetic and engaging.  I like the way he handles time, as though painting in layers, going back to a point and elaborating on it, coming back to a  &quot;present&quot; and then going back again and again, and then finally  moving forward to the end, although I don't think the last parts of the  book live up to the promise at the beginning.<br /> I have remarked  elsewhere that the book disappoints with its phony PC notions about how Kip  and some others might have reacted to the atomic bombing of the Japanese  cities, the author imagining that Kip would be offended that the bomb was  dropped on &quot;brown people&quot; and not on Europeans; but in truth, few  at the time really comprehended nor cared about anything other than ending  the horror of the worst war in human history.  I was more horrified by the  booby trap bombs left behind by the Germans that Kip had to disarm because  they were left specially to murder people whereas the atomic bombs had at  quickly as possible and with a minimum of lost life.  Would Ondaatje have  wanted to storm the island of Japan?  I don't think so.<br /> But that is  not the novel's only conformance with the current politically correct  climate.  The English Patient, like the preponderence of contemporary  novels focuses on a woman, in this case the nurse Hana, surrounded by  various interesting men, mainly because that is what the market place  requires.  My point is that even the most skillful and accomplished  artists, and Ondaatje is one of them, must conform to the dictates of their  age in commercial terms or not be published at all.<br /> I saw the movie  first and then read the book, something I almost never do, and I was  reminded of a remark by a student of mine who said that she preferred to  read the book first because that way she drew in her mind her own picture  of what the characters were like.  I found myself greatly influenced by the  actress who played Hana (Juliette Binoche), so much so that I did not form  any independent conception of the way Hana appeared in the book.  I think  and the actor's interpretation.<br /> Good book, but not the masterpiece I  had hoped for.y independent conception of the way Hana appeared in the book.

B000000993|5.0|Read below a bit, as &quot;JosephHale&quot; tries to say that Undertow has a religious theme.  He thinks that the singer of &quot;Intolerance&quot; and &quot;Flood&quot; is GOD.  Listens he not to the words?  Intolerance is  directed, possibly, AT a religion, and Flood has nothing to do with God.   And it's certainly not about anybody causing a Flood to wipe out  mankind.<br />Tell me what you think.  Or tell him.
6305268843|5.0|My mother rented this movie and brought it to me and said that she Knew that I would like it (I am a huge historical romance fan) She was rigt, I loved it. I was crying by the end. Sophie Marqeau (Elisabeth) is one of the  most beautiful and talented actresses I have ever seen and Steven Dillane  who played Charles Godwin was also fabulous. What I liked most about this  movie though was how honest every character was, no one ever lied to each  other and no matter what. This was very refreshing. The young girl  (Dominique Belcourt who played Louisa was also very well cast. I  deffinately want this for my collection and will buy it when the price  comes down, or when it comes out on DVD. Will the music ever be put on CD?  lets hope so it also was wonderful.
B000000WFZ|5.0|This music embodies the spirituality and fear that course through the movie's themes. The use of the oboe and the strings is perfectly melded, and the repetition of the haunting melody is simply exquisite. I listen to  this CD at the office and in the car, and it settles me down, calms me.  It's a must for any lover of original comtemporary music.
B000000OTU|4.0|I loved &quot;Cryin&quot;, &quot;Crazy&quot; and &quot;Amazing&quot; when they came off the Get a Grip album and was pysched to get them along with other Aerosmith hits in one collection.  There are a few duds, but  generally it's good.
B00000373U|5.0|Elliott Smith is a poet and an incredible musician. If you are a music fan and love deep thought provoking melodies this cd is a must buy. I consider this cd as well as XO two of the best cd's ever, both in my top 10 of all  time.
0345403959|1.0|Did anyone else notice anything wrong with this book?  The greatest danger Belgarath faces in this book is when he first meets Torak.  Through the rest of the book, even when he fights Zedar in Morindim(DID ANYONE ALSO  NOTICE HOW INCOMPETENT AND WEAKLY SKILLED IN SORCERY ZEDAR WAS?), you know  that he isn't in any danger.  Even CTUCHIK is shown as being incompetent  when compared to Belgarath.<br />If you're reading this book too see some  excitement in Belgarath life, don't. Read the third book of the Belgariad  and see CTUCHIK give Belgarath the fight of his life.
B000009CEM|5.0|FF is a unique band; they are poised on a razor's edge between death metal (which i absolutely hate) and industrial (which i absolutely love).  The result is an unlikely and amazing hybrid that i think succeeds on every  level, from the bone-crushing &quot;shock&quot; to the beautiful and  ethereal &quot;timelessness&quot;.  Definitely their best and most varied  album and much better than anything by crowd-pleasers such as korn and  bizkit-FF can actually play more than just one type of song!!
6305078564|5.0|This is one of the rare movies that I want to watch over and over again without being bored. Unlike most of the long movies, I can watch this whole movie in just one sitting. Casting is superb as much as their talents. I am  very happy to add DVD version of this movie to my collection. This movie is  trully a gem!!
0060977493|5.0|I found this book incredible, it was recomended by a friend and I have since then recomended it to anyone who will listen. Ms. Roy has an icredible way of bringing the reader into her world. I really could not put  the book down and I will for ever have a little girl living in my mind  wearing yellow sunlasses with red lenses who makes you pay attention to all  the small things in life.
B000007U5G|5.0|When Gillan and Glover left Deep Purple Mark II, the remaining three  components wondered whether to hire Glenn Hughes both as the bass player  and the lead singer. Books say that they were not convinced, and so they  got David Coverdale too. When I first discovered this, I thought they were  right and that Glenn couldn't do it alone. After listening to this CD I  changed my mind ....
0553213105|5.0|This is the first book I've reviewed at Amazon that didn't have a bad review! That must say something. I truely enjoyed this book from the first page to the last. It proves that even back in the 18 century, people where  humiliated by there parents and family too! Elizbeth is a wonderful heroine  and Mr. Darcy is magical (even though he may not seem so at first). For a  real treat, watch the BBC TV-MOVIE. It is for sale probably at Amazon and  it is the perfect companion for any P&amp;P admirier.
6304819935|5.0|It was about 2 am on a school night back in 87' when I first saw Evil Dead 2.  I was just looking to see what was on Cinemax before I went to sleep, and ED 2 was about 5 mins in already.  Once I got a glimpse of the movie I  physically could not stop watching.  It was mesmerizing!  I had never, and  still haven't, seen anything like it before.  Completely original and  totally entertaining.
0790729628|5.0|After having loved the first release with the Harrison Ford voice-over, this DVD Director's Cut edition amazed me even further.  The absence of the running commentary allows the movie to be even more moody, more poignant,  and allows the actors to take center stage.  It was wonderful not being  told what was going on, who was thinking what, and how I was supposed to  feel.  It felt like a real work of art where each viewer is allowed to take  away what they want.  Buy the DVD and throw away the VHS version.
B000002O5L|5.0|Tom Petty exhibits his songwriting and performance genius in this stellar collection - his first &quot;solo&quot; outing.  Every track is a gem.  This is just one recording you can listen to over and over again without  getting tired of.  Petty's obvious intelligence and wisdom about life are  evident in many of his lyrical observations.
B000000W5L|5.0|I know, it seems so dull to say something so conventional, but I love the Rolling Stones and this is one of my favorite albums. The raw power of this music is divine. Normally, I listen to punk or alternative, but I keep  coming back to this classic. It's like the haze of a hot summer night, or a  party that you stay at until you're blind-drunk, and everyone looks like an  old friend.
B000002HMH|1.0|Never have I regretted buying a Metallica CD, until now.  I tried to like it, but it was impossible.  The new alternitve/country sound of this album just made me sick.  I was completly disapointed with the new direction the  music has taken.   The only reason I knew it was a Metallica album was the  name on the cover.  If you like alternative then by all means buy the  album.  If you are looking for Heavy Metal buy something else, The Chemical  Wedding by Bruce Dickinson is your best bet, IT ROCKS!!!!
B00001ODHL|1.0|How on Earth can anyone like this garbage? It makes sense how our society of kids enjoy trash like this. Bruce Campbell couldn't act his way outta a paper bag.  SKIP THIS ONE!
B000002HRE|1.0|This is an alternitive album.  Where are the blistering riffs?  Where are the thundering chords?  Where has the Heavy Metal gone???  This was such a waste of my money!! When I think of the other CD's I could've bought it  makes me cry!!!
6304819935|5.0|I really cannot describe this movie in words, as it is something that MUST be seen.  It is so cleverly written, directed, acted, etc. that it is amazing.  Quit reading this and order the movie.  It was unavailable for a  long time, but it's back.  Oh yeah, try turning the color in your tv to  black and white and watch it again.  You'll be visiting Amazon.com again to  order another copy after you wear your first one out.
0790729628|5.0|the special effects alone are enough reason to watch this masterpiece
B000009ED0|1.0|I bought this cd hoping it would have some good sounds on it and war terribly disappointed when i heard such horrible music. It put me in such anticipation listening to the beginning of each song, hoping it would be a  winner. It let me down every time. Blah Kid Rock, you are new stuff i'll  give you that, but you lack skills
6303201962|4.0|star trek and non-star trek fans will love this highly entertaining sci-fi film. the plot concerns a villian named khan who wants revenge on admiral kirk. the special effects are very good,despite the fact that you could  tell most (or all) of them were fake,but c'mon,this is the early eighties.  special effects weren't as advanced as they are today.
B000002G87|5.0|I was not around back then, but even I think that this is probably one of  the greatest albums of all time.
0792156684|5.0|The first mistake that James Cameron made when he set out to make a film of the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster was deciding to write the script himself. He churned out a hideous piece of tripe that no amount of anything  could save--stiff-as-a-board dialogue (lines such as &quot;I'm just rolling  along like a tumbleweed in the wind&quot; indicate a startling Bob Dylan  fixation), contrived and unmoving plotting, and a nearly infinite length.  &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; got away with it because it was poetically  written and magnificently acted, especially by Vivien Leigh.  &quot;Titanic&quot; is butt-numbingly long. The reason? A wretched script,  and thespians who act as if they're to be shot with the plague at the end  of the film-- they're obviously not very excited about finishing. What  Cameron is not, is a screenwriter, or much good with actors. What he is, is  a brilliant action director, and when the ship begins to collapse  (finally), there are long, thrilling set pieces that will probably be  analyzed in film classes for years to come. Unfortunately, the rest of the  film is tiresome and shockingly stupid--it might be intellectually  stimulating to the 13-year-old girls that made up its core audience, but  not to anyone who likes to have an abstract thought now and then. Okay,  diatribe over.
0671502336|5.0|It is all said in the one-liner
6305470464|5.0|Good casting, good scenario, perfect directing, If there was more that 5 stars to give, I would say yes.
0553269631|5.0|I am a high school senior and despite all the negative feedback from other young people, I loved this book.  This book had been sitting on my mom's bookcase for as long as I can remember, and the title had always caught my  eye.  Finally, one day last week I picked it up and started reading.  From  the first page, I was hooked. I read it in only 4 days.  It's too bad that  other teenagers can't appreciate this incredibly moving novel.  It is  without question one of my favorite novels ever.
014028009X|4.0|This was such a fun read - and quick too.  I love British humor.  Being single realy helped me relate.
6303201962|5.0|One of the fastest paced movies I have ever seen.  James Horner's score tops them all.  Ricardo Montalbon is aGREAT ACTOR.  Great acting, music, plot etc. make this a great movie. Only Insurrecton, Undescoverd Country  and The Motion Picture.
B000002UAR|5.0|The Beatles are the ultimate band. There's no denying it. I suggest you  get all the albums, but, if you don't have any, get this one. My favorite  sone, is &quot;I'm only sleeping&quot;. It just about sums up my feelings  in the morning.
0140186409|5.0|although I am a student, I was not required to read this book over the summer. It was very long, but I couldn't put it down. A truly great American classic.
0345349571|5.0|Absolutely the finest book I've read on the subject. Scholarly yet very readable for the novice historian like myself.  People and places come alive.  An in depth study of politics, religion and European society of  that time.  It isn't always a pretty picture of who we were, hence the  title is relevant, a reflection of who we are today....ominous.
B00000JY1X|5.0|do not buy the discs individually! you must purchase the box set...enclosed is a booklet with a very long interview with stephin merritt where he talks about each individual song...very interesting stuff, indeed!  plus, the songs are stellar. a must have for any magnetic fields lover.
B000001Y9I|1.0|I'm a huge Deep Purple and an even bigger Steve Morse fan.  I tried to like this album, and after listening to it four times, I gave up.  The music has no spontaniety or punch.  There is no excitement or catchy  rhythmn.  I really hope Steve Morse goes back to his progressive jazz and  bluegrass roots.
B0000026CM|5.0|Lukather and Paich outdid themselves on this one. The mix is excellent, as most of Toto's albums are. A great combination of hard driving rock and rock ballads, this album puts many conteporaries to shame and makes you  wonder why this wasn't even nominated for a Grammy.  What 'Toto IV' was in  its day, 'The Seventh One' is just as timeless. I owned this album when it  first came out and 'lost it' to someone who wanted to 'borrow it' a year or  so later.  It has taken me a long time to find it again. Grab it while you  can because it is a true treasure to have, especially if you are a Toto  fan. So get it! Put it in, turn in up! And rip off the nobs! Because you're  gonna ROCK!! JNorth, Colo. Spgs.
0393314804|5.0|This intense novel really hits hard and exposes us to the fact that it's so important to maximize the one life that we have.  Mr. Welsh really wants us to know that we must choose responsibility, work, the right friends,  growing up, and not to let life pass us by or we will be forever  &quot;trainspotting&quot;.
6300182266|4.0|The pilot for this '78-'79 TV series was indeed of motion picture quality. Fabulous special effects, particularly when you consider the year.  Many of them surpassed even Star Wars' effects, partly, I suppose, because they  were done by the same man -- Dystra.  Story has some faults, particularly  during the climax, but overall very nicely done.  Deserves a better  reputation.  But it may be coming back in movie form by the makers of Wing  Commander.  Hope that they remember the original and build on it, instead  of trying something completely new.
B000002J23|4.0|A much better recording than many fans and critics thought. Lots of off-time arrangements and extended workouts. The additions of Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes work surprisingly well, and for anybody whining about the  lyics, they're no more obscure than anything Jon Anderson's ever written.
B000003S0I|5.0|A master piece. The band seems to have evolved from its `classical tunes of IN THE COURT...(except for 21st C. Schizoid Man) to a complexity in both composition and performance. Fripps guitar has the best distorted sound  Ive ever listened to; check out Wettons bass in Larks part 2; BILL  BRUFORDs DRUMMING on Larkspart 2 and EASY MONEY. You have it all in this  record; Do you want a beautiful song? Try BOOK OF SATURDAY, marvellous  vocals and guitar, and a dancing bass line. Do you want an orgasmic song?  Try Talking Drums crescendo. Do you want two of the best songs all through  the history of rock? Try Easy Money and Larks part 2.A plea: give yourself  enough time to listen to it. Put it on four or five times and see what  happens all along the music they play. Try  to tell the different  instruments and listen to them alone. In any King Crimson album there is  too much (musical)information which at the beginning can sound rare (and it  does).If you give the record 3 or 4 hours in a week, I assure you that you  would enjoy it the rest of your life. My favourite thing on the album:  Rhythm section in Easy Money.
B000002J1I|2.0|Onward is great. Don't Kill The Whale is potentially good (the live version on Yesshows is better). The rest is sludge -- badly produced, and no ear for strong melody or progressive arrangements. The band's second  worst album, after the horrific 'Union'.
B00000JCB2|5.0|This is the only CD I have where I dont have to  skip songs. If you have'nt got this CD yet get it. Fred Durst sings better on this CD than he did on &quot;Faith&quot;
0151001820|4.0|Club Dumas had me engrossed from page one. I love nothing better than reading about old books and if you throw a mystery in on top, I'm hooked.  However, like those who have expressed an opinion before me, I thought the  ending was a big let down. I also thought the character known only as 'the  girl' added nothing to the story. I had imagined as I was reading that she  may have been an undercover policewoman or something of the sort following  Corso in order to solve Enrique's hanging. However, in the end, she turned  out to be nothing at all. You could have wiped her from the book and noone  would have noticed. I understand that Hollywood is making a movie based on  this book. I believe it is to star Johnny Depp. Should be interesting to  see it on the big screen.
6304082428|5.0|I am deaf, so the problem I had when I bought the video was that it had no close captions. Therefore, I could not watch it. I did, however, see it on mini-series on t.v. with close captions. It was really good. Is there a  movie with these same group of people with close captions? It would really  help me a lot!
B0000062GE|5.0|Sometimes it hurts is one of my favorite songs, but almost everysong on  this album is good enough to be a cd single.  i strongly recomend you buy  this.
0790740656|4.0|This is the most believable acting Tom Cruise has done before he started taking himself way too seriously. Great plot, superb soundtrack, very humorous and erotic. Worth the time to see.
B0000062IR|5.0|I hate ungod, i think that is such a bad album, but this album, Darkest  Days, is so amazing i cannot even describe it.  Almost every song on this  album speaks to you.  I mean i can really feel the emotion behind each  song, there are no bland, pointless songs just put in to take up space.   This might be the best album i have ever bought and i would (obviously)  stongly suggest you buy it.
B00000K19E|2.0|This movie was saved by the special effects.  The theories presented will appeal to the internet  conspiracy junkie.  Dead spots, the mad max underworld, dandling storyline left me flat. Predictable plot.  What was  with the old lady? Without the special effects this would have never been  released.
6303394000|5.0|I first saw this movie in 1983, got the video around 85, replaced it once, and still watch it every six months or so.  It's depressing, cynical, caustic, and funny - and if Bob Fosse loved Bob Fosse; still, his love for  the musical shines through every scene.  Remains my all time favorite movie  for the last 15 years; and so seamlessly put together that it wasn't until  probably the dozenth or so viewing that I realized Roy Scheider actually  can't dance a step.
0671578278|5.0|I loved this book. It had everything gut splitting humour, food fights, political intrigue, and regency romance. It's one of those books that once you start reading it you just can't stop and when you do finish you want  more. I want more and so will you.
0385493800|3.0|Disappointing read from a favorite author.  Great premise..beginning but crawled to the end.
B000001FDI|3.0|This was the &quot;album of the semester&quot; in my dorm when it came out.  You could hardly walk down the hall without hearing Blind Faith.  We all enjoyed it for several months.  Excellent tunes!     This is a very  nice collaboration of some of this era's finest British Blues artists and  would be a welcome addition for anyone who has loved Traffic, Cream, et al.        However, for me it has not worn as well as some of the timeless music  from that era: the best Hendrix, early Santanta, A-Bros, and even Its a  Beautiful Day.
0312958455|5.0|I have been lucky to read all of Harry Bosch's experiences in order and I am ready for more. I think I know who the villian is and I change my opinion many times before the end. This was one of the best so far!
0374172897|5.0|MY book group read MRS. DALLOWAY and THE HOURS.  We found the combination provided an indeepth discussion of homosexuality, post war London/New York and the richness of an ordinary day. What a lark! What a plunge! Comparing  THE HOURS to MRS. DALLOWAY was a puzzle worth completing.
6303234844|5.0|Everyone else who has reviewed this tape has said it all...It's Amazing!!  I wanted to let you all know that there is a companion CD-ROM GAME called &quot;EVE&quot;. If you LOVE this video like everyone else does, you MUST  get the &quot;EVE&quot; adventure as well ...HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!!!!
B000002OX7|5.0|The greatest record from the greatest band with the greatest songwriter in rock history!  nuff said.
B000001Y2U|5.0|This CD is rich with secrets and surprises and it is well written. Manson worked hard on this album and he deserves 5 stars!!
B000002GG0|5.0|I am slowly building my Cat collection on CD.  I started with 8 tracks and then vinyl.  This is a must-have for a Cat collector.  It is truly a unique recording from Cat Stevens.  Foreigner Suite is, of course, what makes this  album special but the 'b' side songs are terrific as well.  I give it 5  stars, but then I'd probably give all Cat albums 5 except maybe Izitso.
B00000IOSU|5.0|Sarah has come a long way, and this CD proves it.  Her voice is so rich with emotion and strength.  I love the way she changes some of her songs.  Every time I play this CD I get tears in my eyes.  If you have never bought  music from Sarah or even if you have, this is definately the CD to buy.   You get to hear her how she really sounds; not like a studio recorded  album.
0380973464|4.0|During my military service I served as a cryptographer. Up till now I've never viewed the work I did as exciting, but after having read this book I've changed my perspectives.<br />You can clearly tell that Neil Stephenson  has done quite a lot of research in the field of cryptography and I feel  perfectly at home with the plot and the details. Sure, it's imaginative,  speculative; at certain points bordering on the paranoid, but that's just  the way I want Neil Stephenson's books to be. More adjectives? Okay. Smart,  futuristic. That goes without saying when talking about Neil Stephensons  books.<br />Oh, by the way: if you're an entrepreneur it will fill your head  with cool ideas and wild perspectives. Beware!
B00000GAIW|5.0|As a young high school girl growing up in southren California. I have  excellent memories of Tull Concerts, and many hours of listening and  listening to this record. I worshiped Tull Moody Blues and Tommy the Who.  Great fun!
0440180295|5.0|The sadness and the humor mixed together in this book truly show how devastating war can be and make it hard to either feel sorry for Billy Pilgrim or just laugh at him, but Vonnegut definitely gets the point across  that war is hell, in and out of it.
6304509154|5.0|When I saw this movie, I was suprised.  No grisly murders or disgusting graphic gore!  instead, there was a fun, genuinely scary movie with heart, too.  this movie shows how strong the love of a family can be, and how,  together, they can overcome anything.  this is also a very spooky movie to,  so don't worry, horror fanaticts; the climax is well worth watching the  movie for!!!!!!
0553573403|5.0|A very gripping plot that keeps readers reading and the critics quiet.  An outstanding buy for all fantasy readers and even for those that are not.
B00000DBXL|5.0|I bought this CD for &quot;Sheep Go To Heaven&quot; but I wound up absolutely loving it! I am constantly listening to this CD and I never mind having one of the tracks stuck in my head.
078322687X|5.0|This movie totally rocks! I just saw it on television and had to buy the DVD so I can see it in full. I really enjoyed it and let me say it is 300 times better than &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; who people seemed to think  deserves the attention that the Breakfast Club got and still receives. Get  this DVD, you will not be disapointed!
B00000HZFH|5.0|I was introduced to BTS by a friend and I cant get enough.  Reminds me of Jane's Addiction, ignore the reviews that say they have no talent, these guys are a very original band with a different sound that some just cant  appreciate.  The guitars are GREAT and Doug's voice mixes with them them  like no one else besides maybe Robert Plant\Jimmy page.
B00000K2SD|5.0|I loved this movie. It was so good I can't put it into words
B000002J09|5.0|I've listened to this album 3 times in a row last night. It is so  excellent. It's hard to choose a favorite because I love all 8 of the  tracks deeply.<br />Here are my ratings for all the songs: &quot;Black  Dog&quot;-- A  &quot;Rock And Roll&quot;--A  &quot;Battle Of  Evermore&quot;--B  &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot;--A+  &quot;Misty Mountain  Hop&quot;--B+  &quot;Four Sticks&quot;-- A  &quot;Going To  California&quot;--A  &quot;When The Levee Breaks&quot;--A<br />I must say that  &quot;Going To California&quot;, is probably one of Zep's most  underappreciated songs, that I love deeply.<br />Oh yeah, I wouldn't be caught  dead muttering to other people that such a talentless band like  &quot;Floyd&quot;, are better than Led Zeppelin.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey road is an impossible album to criticize. Except for Pink Floyd's The Wall and U2's Joshua tree, Abbey Road is really the only perfect album, and it deserves 6 stars- but the review was horrible.  John Lennon at is  most inspired was not Come Together.  In fact I Want You and Come ogether  were his worst songs.  How can you compare them to Strawberry Fields and  Sexy Sadie-  where as the work of McCarney on this album was his greatest.   John Lennon at his best was on side B possibly with Because or Mean Mr.  Mustard and Ploythene Pam- Because is pure genius musically- Come Together  is almost a rap song-  Paul McCartney's Oh! Darling is one of his best pure  rock n' rollers and Octupus' Garden was Ringo's only fantastic contribution  to the band.
1558903259|5.0|This is probably the most beautiful piece of animation ever to appear onscreen.  ('Fantasia' and 'Pinocchio' are very close behind it.)  I saw it when it was first released in the theatres.  When it was available to buy  on video in 1992, I bought a copy for a friend but stupidly assumed that it  would be around for awhile so I could get one for myself.  I'm still  kicking myself.  I WANT THIS MOVIE.  So do a lot of other people I know.   If anybody with any strings to pull is reading this, please be aware of  that.  This film is incredible!  The songs are worthy of being in a  Broadway play, they're so good.  Belle is a wonderful, smart heroine and  Beast has a beautiful soul. . .one can see why Belle fell in love with him,  despite his unusual appearance.  A great film to see by yourself or with  your children.
6304698623|1.0|Why bother making a film of a Little Princess without actually reading it.  The book was set in the 19th century and the father never came back, he was dead.  Also why the move to America?
6302638771|3.0|The viewer is left with a lot of questions, the biggest one being:  &quot;So, WHO exactly was responsible for the assassination of John F. Kennedy?&quot;  Oliver Stone offers an extremely complex, incredibly  unconvincing argument that the CIA, exiled Cubans, the Mafia and big  business were somehow all involved.  William of Occam could offer a much  more likely theory, but that story wouldn't have been as interesting.   Still worth seeing, but don't take it seriously.

B000006NPY|5.0|I used to think that people were smart to like the Smashing Pumpkins. Now I realize that too many people liked them only when they were loud. For God's sake, learn to hear music! This is the best album of the last 3  years. The first time I heard it I was in complete awe, and I knew that my  life had changed. They had kept making great music, and a brave new world  was opened up to me. Buy it if you apreciate music.
B000002HGD|5.0|Alot of techno artists often decry Moby's lack of innovation or genuine craft, but that was never really Moby's agenda. Moby built his name on his ambient work, which is frankly some of the moving, inspirational music you  will ever hear in pop. Ambient as a form of chamber/soundtrack music,  melancholy melodies, Baroque fills, and epic dynamics.  Really very  beautiful stuff.<BR><BR>Using ambient as his foundation, he forms 12 great  pop tunes that run the gamut of styles -- house, classical, trance, jungle,  punk, hip-hop, and world-beat -- map[ing an emotionally wild journey into  the heart of Moby's faith.  At parts, you'll be hurled into pits of rage.   At others, you'll be moved to tears.  And frequently, you'll feel a pure  ecstatic joy that exceeds most house music.<BR><BR>His Christian faith  informs almost all of Everything Is Wrong, for in a sense, most of the  tracks are really gospel songs, put to his ambient &quot;orchestra&quot;,  and mixed in with beats.  Ear candy and chicken soup for the  soul.<BR><BR>To judge Moby's music on purely dance terms is to ignore that  Moby is a modern soul man.  And this is truly a great soul record in a  genre often assumed to have none.
0800129806|4.0|Come on! Julia Ormond shouldn't be chosen as the Queen. All she has is just the face of an English lady, but her acting skill is way off compared to these two other famous stars. Sean Connery, I have to say this: You're  the best actor I've ever seen before. He really got it out when he saw the  scene of Lancelot and Guinevere kissed. <br />But I have to say that Julia  didn't have a lot of facial expressions in this movie. All she does is  weep. She got her face wet first when Lancelot saved her from Malagant. She  wept when she kissed Lancelot. She wept again when she tried to explain  herself to Arthur. She wept again when she saw Arthur died. This is all she  does in this movie. Don't you think so? <br />Nevertheless, watch this. It's  time-worthy.
B00000J6AG|4.0|The idea of mixing electronica with old-blues/gospel vocals was truly a powerful statement about the music of the 20th century.  The logical conclusion to the &quot;Big Beat&quot; genre, Play had every reason to be  the most spiritual, ecstatic, moving dance record ever  made.<BR><BR>Unfortunatedly, Play also exposes Moby's weaknesses as a DJ  (and his strengths too.)  Mainly, while he's an admirably eclectic artist,  he doesn't do any genre (besides his trademark ambient style) particularly  well.  He seems to be content wrapping the samples around, essentially, a  4-piece funk band.  Which would be fine, except that often his idea of a  funk band doesn't swing quite right.  Even Bodyrock seems to plod in  places.  That said, none of the up-tempo songs are bad, and Honey and  Run-On do get your body moving.  However, I would credit that more to the  vocals than the backing.<BR><BR>The samples are truly powerful.  And when  he slows things down, wrapping them in his classic, emotional synth style,  oh man, you'll be holding back tears.  Tracks like &quot;My Weakness&quot;  and &quot;Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?&quot; are that good.  In this  sense, Play really does achieve its ambitions, even exceeding Everything Is  Wrong in giving you soul power.<BR><BR>The rest of the CD indulges in good,  though not great instrumental pieces and bluesy trip-hop with Moby's  vocals.  Quite good, though again not as accomplished as the &quot;real  stuff.&quot;  Particularly when you consider that alot of trip-hop artists  already sing the blues, so to speak.<BR><BR>So, Play is essentially a  hit-and-miss affair.  Sometimes brilliant, sometimes dull, always  challenging the limitations of the genre and Moby's abilities.
B00000K3UR|5.0|As a fan of Adam Sandler, I feel that he's really come into his own with his portrayal of Sonny in &quot;Big Daddy&quot;.  His character was the same immature type of slacker, but it had a very human side.  It was a real  character, someone that I believed in by the end of the movie, kind of like  Robbie in the &quot;Wedding Singer&quot;.  Sandler non-fans will probably  care less for it than Sandler fans, but who cares?  Another Hit!!!
0141301066|5.0|Matilda is one of the few novels I've read more  than 3 times. An inspiring plot, funny characters and a humour would be my comment on this exceptional novel.    Also, there is a movie on this, starring Mara Wilson  and Danny DeVito and I'm sure you'll enjoy it!
B00000JPH6|5.0|It is difficult for me to rate anything as &quot;absolute&quot;, but this movie is, for lack of a better word, flawless. . .  The story has a discernable start and a realistic (if an animatronic muppet movie can be  realistic) if all too soon ending.  The characters are at least likeable,  and most are loveable!  Augre was truly one of the best put-together  characters in almost any movie I've seen. . .  There's something to being  able to create a character to match their &quot;character&quot;.  One can  definitely see the influence of Jim Henson's studios in FARSCAPE, and this  is FARSCAPE'S Great Grandfather!  Very Hobbit-esque. . .  I'd LOVE to see  the Tolkein masterpieces done in this fashion!!!
0812523334|5.0|I loved this book! It is beautiful and heartwarming and sweet. It actually inspired me to write stories as well. I laughed and cried and displayed about every possible emotion! My favorite characters are Laurie and Jo. I  also have the movie (1994 version with an extrodiary performance by  Christian Bale...Laurie, Winona Ryder...Jo and Susan Surandan...Marmie) The  CD is just as delightful. A must read...
B00000JZC4|4.0|Filter is a very good metal band.This CD proves that they can be consistent.Welcome to the Fold, Captain Bligh and The Best Things are all very good songs!Even so, all the others are good too.I think this is just  as good or better than the songs i've heard off their first album.
B00000I924|5.0|jeff beck fans know that this  virtuoso is true only to them by taking a musical genre and putting his own unique stamp on it, in true beck style. jeff has ALWAYS been an innovator, not a follower. if given a chance to see  him live beg, borrow, or steal to get there! disregard the  &quot;critics&quot; reviews and buy this CD. you won't regret it!!!
B000001G16|5.0|Once in a decade, an album comes along that sums up that decade.  For the  70's, it was the White Album.  For the 80's, it was Pyromania.  For the  90's, it is Stranger in This Town.  Bon Jovi without Jon Bon Jovi?  Nope.   This is Richie doing what Richie does best... playing and singing from the  heart.  He truly shows his spirit and his soul.  This album shows that  music is 10% inspiration, 10% talent and 100%  perspiration.<br />&quot;Stranger&quot; is one of those MUST HAVE recordings.

0451198492|5.0|This book is SO great! I am very eager to read the rest of the series. This book is about a black, rectangular slab, about a mile high, called TMA-1(The Monolith Anomaly #1)which is discovered on the moon about 30 feet  under. Earth sends a spaceship, called Discovery, which is supposed to  investigate. But the two crew members, David Bowman and Frank Poole, don't  know about it. They think they are supposed to rendevouz with the Discovery  II while in hibernation. The only people who know anything about TMA-1 are  three frozen hibernauts, and the computer that controls the ship, HAL 9000.  But HAL starts malfunctioning, and Bowman and Poole want to disconnect HAL.  And HAL, who knows this mission is most important, cannot let them do that.  This adventure leads to Saturn's imaginary moon, Japetus, where the most  mysterious things begin to happen.....But, i'm not going to tell you what  happens, you'll just have to read the book. So hop aboard! Join Bowman and  Poole, aboard Discovery, while the science-fiction mystery begins to  unravel......Based on one of the most fantastic movies of all time,  directed by Stanley Kubrick, director of Dr. Strangelove, Clockwork Orange,  and Eyes Wide Shut, 2001: A Space Odyssey will bend your mind and spark  your imagination!
B000000OUJ|5.0|The Genius stands alone today as the greatest MC ever, on both of his albums he puts out the phatest lyrics, no other rapper has the skill or intensity to do this, even Nas let up after Illmatic, but the GZA has kept  it real.

6305537550|3.0|Well, I know I'm going to get a lot of flak for this, but I just don't see what all the hype is about concerning Halloween.  Yes, it is well crafted, and yes, for it's time it was scary.  But it is also EXTREMELY slow and  plodding, with countless shots of Mike just shambling around, stalking  Jaime.  Get to the point!  It seems as if  John Carpenter wanted to go for  an atmosphere of dread and horror, but I believe that other movies (which  were made either during or before that time) were better at it, like  Suspiria and Night of the Living Dead.  The film is too routinely paced and  routinely directed to stand out in the viewer's mind, and really is nowhere  as scary as its reputed to be.  Give it a shot, but just don't be surprised  if you aren't as blown away (or scared) as everyone said you would be.
B000002C25|3.0|Oasis third album its a really weak record , too many beatles references , and they dont get even close to those great beatles songs they just try to copy them every time they see the oportunity  , some tracks (most of  them) are boring and stupid , except for the girl in the dirty shirt , its  gettin better man , and be here now , the other ones are just crap , better  buy whats the story morning glory than this one
0671578278|5.0|It constantly amazes me: Lois McMaster Bujold is the only author I've ever encountered who could write a long series of books that have original plots and (gasp!) continuous character development.  I have loved every one of  her Miles Vorkosigan books, and &quot;A Civil Campaign&quot; is no  exception.  Bujold fans, buy this book immediately!  New-comers, buy this  book and all the others as soon as possible!
0671027344|5.0|Wow. That's all I can say. I connected with this book on so many levels. I'm currently a high school Senior and in many ways I wish my experiences could have been more like those of Charlie. And in some ways I've been  through the exact same things as he. What I loved so much about Charlie's  character is that he is so pure and real. He doesn't judge and is just such  a caring and sensitive person. I was amazed at his comitment to help  Patrick after his loosing Brad. It just touched me in ways I can't even  describe. Mostly, I felt that Chbosky's characters were so real. I probably  see dozens of people just like them every day at school. Moreover, the  characters weren't just real, they were honest. They showed sides of  themselves that I think all off us have and very often try to hide from the  world. I think this reading experience has helped me to feel a little more  normal, to know that I am not alone, and it will help me to be more honest  with and true to myself.
6302250269|5.0|Thelma &amp; Loise is truly one of the best movies ever made. There's one thing though. It's not just for women. Men can enjoy this beautiful film and it's meanings as well. A great movie that provokes powerful emotions  from within. Superb!
B00000IAU3|5.0|I first heard &quot;Here With Me&quot; on MTV's 120 Minutes, and and fell  in love with the song.  I am very picky about my music (I only bought my  first album two years ago, and only have 20 albums).  I decided to take a  gamble and buy her disc, and I have to say it is the best album I bought  this year.  If you are a fan of Sarah or Natalie Merchant, you will love  this album too.
6305513406|5.0|I was 23 when it first came out - the Vietnam war was just starting to heat up. I didn't start to watch it until it came out in syndication around 1974. Some of the social allegory is quite obvious, but it still wears well  in spite of the cheesy special effects and in spite of some really rotten  episodes (like CHARLEY X or the one with Melvin Belli) , not all of which  are bad enough to be good. However, of the 79 (depending on how you count  them) episodes, there are at least half of them that I will watch just  about every chance I get - even though I have seen all of them (bad and  good) at least five times. Yes, it is better than The Next Generation and  Deep Space Nine and that latest lame opus with the woman as the captain who  sounds like Katherine Hepburn on helium. What's better? The stories, the  good ones anyway (notably MIRROR, MIRROR, the ENTERPISE INCIDENT, ARENA,  AND BALANCE OF TERROR) and the action - TNG doesn't have enough of it;  neither do the other two, but most of all the repartee among Spock, McCoy,  and the others...
B000002UAO|5.0|Another classic album from The Beatles.  I would probably say this is their third best album,  after Magical Mystery Tour and The White Album (although many fans will probably disagree with me).  The album has a  wonderful blend of lyrics and tune, something many bands have failed to do.   The best and most famous songs of the album are probably In My Life, Girl  and Drive My Car.  The most underrated is What Goes On. As I've said, this  is probably not their best album, but what you'd expect from the undisputed  greatest band in the history of music- five stars, definately.
6305513414|4.0|Both are very much entertaining but you must stretch some credibility for one of these stories.<br />If you can discount certain omissions and science screw-ups, then  &quot;Enemy Within&quot; becomes a classic.  Sorry,  shuttlecrafts existed in season 1 so lack of any reference here is  suspicious.  And at that extrme temperature, no phaser is going to work let  alone a human live.<br />&quot;Mudd's Women&quot; is the better of the two in  terms of plot and concepts since it's possible that a temporarily  age-reducing drug could be made whereas you can't circumvent physics and  shuttles.  Mudd is a wonderful character, devious to the extreme.  This  alone makes it worthwhile but there are plenty of good elements.

6305165912|5.0|This movie is amazing. If you have not seen it yet watch it imediatly. In tradition of the Blues Brothers Coen keeps the &quot;laid back attitude while your world is in chaos&quot; and rides it to a hit. While this movie  is not a box office hit it has become a cult favorite between me and my  friends. Between the great cinematography to the soundtrack this movie is a  sure buy.
B000002UJQ|5.0|It is hard to believe, but Radiohead has released an album that even beats its previous two efforts, Pablo Honey and The Bends.  This album gets better upon every listening.  The only thing that I can say tops their  albums is their live performances.  A Radiohead concert makes these already  incredible songs sound out of this world.  Definitely buy this album to tie  you over until you have the chance to see them live!!!!!
B00000JPH5|5.0|Me and my parents haved looked for it ever sence we seen it on disney!! We gave six thumbs up!!
6305537542|5.0|&quot;Halloween&quot; is by far the best horror film I have ever seen and is also my personal favorite. The story is so simple: 6 year-old Michael Myers stabs his sister to death on October 31, 1963 in Haddonfield. He is  locked up but 15 years later, he escapes and returns to his hometown, where  he sets his sights on Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her friends,  Annie (Nancy Loomis) and Lynda (P.J. Soles). His psychiatrist, Dr. Sam  Loomis (Donald Pleasence), is hot on Myers' trail before he kills again.  This movie is so scary and suspensful, easily the best of the bunch. For  Jamie Lee Curtis' first movie, she did an excellent job of acting. Veteran  actor Donald Pleasence is also terrific, he is performance is convincing,  you actually KNOW that Michael Myers is pure evil when he talks about him.  What adds to the suspense and horror of the film is that Michael is hardly  seen, he is always in the shadows, waiting to kill. The music is also  fantastic. The main piano theme is one of the most famous to ever grace the  screen. All in all, this is a terrific film, watch this with the lights off  and guarantee you'll be scared!
076783819X|5.0|&quot;Arlington Road&quot; was a black sheep among summer movies.  Perhaps the reason for its disapointing box offic performance was its suprising inteligence.  This is the real movie with ideas about the American  condition, especially our feeling of comfort and perception of normalcy.   The movie manages to encase these ideas in an expertly made thriller.  This  is one of the most suspenseful movies I've seen in a long time, but it also  lets the characters talk.  This means that each suprise is not only  exciting, but heart breaking.  The most interesting aspect of this movie,  other than the ending, is the fact that we are never really sure if we  should side with the main character.  Is he paranoid, or is the likable  neighbor actually a terrorist?  And is this man some one he should trust  with his son?  The ending, not to spoil it, is diffinitely not a Hollywood  ending.  It leaves you with something to think about.  Even if it had ended  conventionally, it still would have been a superior suspense thriller.  The  movie is also technically brillant as well.  Notice the how the  cinematography and lighting lend an inpersonal feel to the suburban  neighborhood.  The real set piece, in my mind, is the party towards the end  of the movie.  When you see it, you'll know what I mean.  Even though it  still remains a sleeper now, I expect this to gather a cult following among  intellectual paranoiacs like me.  My only complaint is that some of the  plot points are a little bit implausible.  But you won't notice this while  you'll watching the movie.  I've gone on long enough.  See it.
B00000AF95|3.0|With KISS refueling their career with albums like Creatures Of The Night and Lick It Up, Animalize keeps the chops up to snuff.  Now in the mist of finding the right lead guitarist, Mark St. John continues what Vinnie  Vincent did on Lick It Up but is kept on a short leash by Gene and Paul.   Also with Gene Simmons knee deep in his new movie career, Paul is the star  on this album.  Left with repolishing Gene's songs like &quot;Burn Bitch  Burn&quot; and &quot;While The City Sleeps&quot;, Paul and Company rip out  hard rockers like &quot;I've Had Enough&quot;, &quot;Under The Gun&quot;,  and &quot;Get All You Can Take&quot;.  This album only contains 9 songs and  could of used a song with Eric Carr on vocals which would have been a treat  for KISS fans, but with the 2 rockin' singles, &quot;Heaven's On Fire&quot;  and &quot;Thrills In The Night&quot;, this album will definately please a  metalhead from the 80's.
0399143904|5.0|Tom Clancys techno thriller Rainbow Six is among one of the finest books I have ever and will ever read it will live on in the minds of readers for years to come.  Tom Clancy makes his charachters deep interesting people  with whom you can really relate to on a more personal level.  It is one of  the greatest books ever and I encourage people all over the country to read  this excellent novel.
0764005685|3.0|This movie would have been a lot better if argento had used original music instead of music from iron maiden and motorhead.  The heavy metal sound doesn't seem appropriate. This movie lacks the the stylisation that  Suspiria has .  None the less it is a fine film that delivers as far as  gore is concerned.  Argento fans will like it but it will not be one of  their favourites.
B00000EZTQ|4.0|&quot;Halloween II&quot; is a great movie, which expands on the original's story but lacks the atmosphere or terror and replaces it with blood and gore. Picking up precisely where &quot;Halloween&quot; left off, Laurie  Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital after  being attacked and Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is still looking for Myers  after shooting him six times. The Shape (Dick Warlock) tracks Laurie to the  hospital where he kills the entire staff with needles, and scalpels and  boiling hot water and a number of other grotesque ways. Well, I have to  tell you, although both films occur on the same night, you can really tell  the difference between the two of them. In the original, Michael hid in the  shadows. In this one, he is always seen. There was absolutely no blood at  all in the first film, in this one, there is blood everywhere. Pools of  blood and gore. The music has improved though, I like the synthesizer and  organ element to the theme. Donald Pleasence did a terrific job, again,  playing the role of Loomis. It seems every movie he goes more over the  edge. Jamie Lee Curtis is wasted though, all she does throughout this movie  is sleep, utter 2 lines of dialogue and then stumble through the halls all  drugged up. The hospital staff are all morons too. I mean, if you were in  charge of a floor of sleeping babies, would you go into the therepy pool  with your boyfriend and make out with him?? If you want the COMPLETE story,  rent the original, this one and H20. Skip the other ones.
0767802659|5.0|Ladies and gentleman and fellow crytics...to all those who think this is a terrible movie, please evolve! I note that many of bad reviews come from people who obviously expected some kind of artful, informative, educational  classic. All this snobbery will be the death of cinema. Once in a while a  film comes along that may termed a spoof and this film undeniably falls  well into this category of pure tongue in cheek fantasy laced with an  antiseptic dusting of humour. Detach yourself from reality, do all the  things that don't come naturally to you, learn not to take life so  seriously, and finish off by laughing....a great film!
6303269869|2.0|Sorry to go against the grain here, but I really didn't care for this movie. My main problem is with Meg Ryan's character. She just isn't a very likeable person. She drinks, slaps her kids, drives drunk with her kids in  the car, completely forgets about her kids while she's out on drinking  binges...and we're supposed to feel empathy with this character?<br />And  then, when the couple breaks up, guess who gets custody of the kids? Mom  the alcoholic! How's that for a little bit of reverse sexism for you?  Sorry, but this movie did very little for me.

B00000K19E|5.0|This movie leaves that feeling in your stomach that you've been looking for this decade at the box office.  It is a must see for sci-fi, philosophy, special effects fans and many more.  The twist in this  story-line is chilling to say the least.  I wish I could see it again for  the first time.
0679720200|5.0|I chose to read this book for my AP English's 'classic novel' project. This book is simply phenomenal for me. If you take this book at face value, it will appear quite stupid and somewhat pointless, as the plot isn't  exactly stellar excitement and characters simply are not too vivid.  However, as one reviewer stated before, you must read this book at a higher  intellectual plane than other pure-action books. The power of this book  comes from its overall effect, not any specific part. How will Meursault  react when he is faced with our absurd society, and all its subsequent  requirements, expectations and judgments? Read and find out....
B00000IPAX|5.0|This CD is quality, however i must admit that a lot of the songs sound the  same.  The beats are very similar to each other, which makes me wonder  which number I'm actually listening to.  If  you are a true blink fan than  I recommend buying Cheshire Cat, in my opinion the best of the Blink Cd's,  however if you are the trendy type that only listens to &quot;What's my age  again&quot; than I suggest you listen to other Blink songs and not be so  damn trendy.  The CD doesn't compare to what the other one's have to offer  with different melodies and beat's along with different lyrics.
630516889X|5.0|I love this movie.  Just watch it in in surround sound to capture all the special sound effects.  Perhaps Arnold's best action film.  Great plot!
B00000JCB2|5.0|This CD is better than the previous Limp CD, it combines all genre's of  music to satisfy the listener.  No matter what your taste in music I think  all will wnjoy what this CD has to offer with incredible beats, smooth  rhymes and amazing sound.

It has a lot to  offer.

0446310786|5.0|This book has been required reading in High Schools for years. My experience is that school actually demotivates people from wanting to read. How many of us can relate with the feelings of never wanting to read  another book after high school. When grades are the motivation to read,  people search for the cliff notes and or look for reviews in Encyclopedias.  In my High School English class, grades were given on the basis of how many  books one read. If you read 8-10 you received an A. The problem was that  after knowing one was going to get an A, all reading stopped. Reading is  supposed to be done for the joy of it. I hear the word boring used a great  deal when reviewing a book. I know so many kids who end up hating reading  because they received a poor grade. The classics including To Kill a  Mockingbird are challenging books. I would never use boring as an adjective  to describe a book however.
6305531374|1.0|How much more can we tolerate? Please let poor old Michael Myers (now probably in his 60's) rest in peace! There is absolutely nothing new in this the....I've lost count of what number sequel this is. The Queen Of  Scream, Jamie Lee Curtis, once again battles her demented, horror masked  clad brother in hopefully the final installment of the  &quot;Halloween&quot; series. The only appealling thing about this movie is  that Jamie's mum Janet Leigh makes an all-too brief appearance....hence the  one star for her!
0140186409|5.0|As I look over the reviews of the classic works of literature, I am appalled by how often I see the word boring being used. I guess it's because great books don't come with big screens, speakers and a joy stick.  Welcome to the Millenium.
6304117302|5.0|This movie is impressive.  Its deliverance of the way life used to be for early settlers is entirely valid, and it serves to remind us of our historical roots.  This rendition of Cooper's classic story is stunningly  beautiful, and in the context of movie standards today it deserves to be  hailed as a masterpiece.  I've seen it so many times I could close my eyes  and run the entire movie through my head, almost line by line.  Take my  advice and watch it, there will be no regrets I promise you.
0375751513|5.0|This book has been required reading in High Schools for years. My experience is that school actually demotivates people from wanting to  read. How many of us can relate with the feelings of never  wanting to read another book after high school. When grades are the  motivation  to read, people search for the cliff notes  and or look for reviews in Encyclopedias.

B00000JPH6|5.0|When I was 8 years old I saw a magazine promoting &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; and the pictures TERRIFIED me. The Skeksis scared me. The Elders scared me. Even the Podlings and the Elves scared me. I think the  only creature in the whole picture that didn't frighten me was Fizzgig.  When it came out, my parents very much wanted to see it, but I definitely  did not. It actually came down to me hiding in my tree house for hours the  day we were supposed to see it. Unfortunately, they found me. We went, but  all I can remember of the experience is abject terror. I covered my eyes  for a lot of the film, I think. But I got through it and grew up a healthy,  normal person. Now I enjoy Tolkien and that brand of storytelling (I think  Henson's &quot;The Storyteller&quot; was one of the best shows ever to  grace TV), but for some reason &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; still makes me  flinch a bit. I like the movie. I really do. I think it's great. I'd like  to buy this DVD but I'm afraid it might give me a complex even having it in  the house. Maybe I should seek help...Just keep all of this in mind when  deciding whether or not to show it to your kids.

B000002OZY|5.0|'Tommy' is definately one of the best albums I've ever heard. While its true that the story may not have made a Pulitzer Prize-winning book, its really about the music. And believe me the music is incredible. Pete  Townshend truly has an ear for melody. If you like rock operas may I also  recommend 'Arthur (Or The Decline And Fall Of The British Empire)' by The  Kinks.
0767805712|5.0|This is the most intelligent science fiction movie I have ever seen. Although it lacks effects its script is brilliant and the acting is superb.  I cannot figure out how this movie did not make it to an Oscar. Its a  masterpiece.  Forget matrix. This is THE Sci Fiction movie of the 90's.
B00000K19E|5.0|Matrix is one of the darkest apocoliptic stories I have seen in years that has been done to extreme standards.  Usually we have seen above average stories with lousy effects and vise versa, this was done with an above  average story that didn't fall too far short on the special effects.  It  was a pleasure for me to have had the fortune to have seen this in all it's  splendore on the big screen.  I agree there are some holes to fill, but all  in all it's one of Sci-Fi's best efforts to date.
B000000OS2|5.0|My personal favorite after Bust A Nut and a  tribute to musicians who are still willing  to do it their way.<br /> The No Machines, do what we want musical style of  Tesla is always impressive as are these terrific   musicians.<br /> Being a Jeff Keith fan I can't imagine anything  better than  listening to him acoustic for 90 min.  &amp; it still remains fresh and  inviting everytime I  hear it....<br /> And thanks for leaving it all in their  guys!   No machines and no compromise*

B000000OQ5|5.0|A knock-out performance by California's own  Tesla! <br /> A terrific raw, fresh 80's sound comes alive on   this one and if you like it hard and rockin then  your gonna love this one.<br /> Keith's killer vocals and  Hannon's crisp guitar  make it a total winner.<br /> Keith's vocal performance  on &quot;We're No good  Together&quot; is a blusey knock-out, turn it up   real loud for this one!!! And you can catch the  original studio version of  &quot;Before My Eyes&quot; here  and catch the acoustic version later on 5  Man  Acoustical Jam, both great, both different.<br /> You'll love it, it's  really a great first effort  and sounds like no other Tesla since...
B0000025KI|1.0|This irritating, tinny, repetitive schlock soared on the hot air pumped  out by Bruce's moonie-like fans. This record served first warning that BS  would devote much of his time to chasing the ghost of Woodie Guthrie -  hence, the ponderous, grim tone of &quot;The River.&quot;<br />The only  noteworthy thing about this record is the worst sample of grammar in music  history - from &quot;Hungry Heart&quot;:<br />&quot;Don't make no differnce  what nobody says. Ain't nobody likes to be alone.&quot;<br />Ain't no 20th  century artist, with the possible exception of Ernest Hemingway, more  over-rated than Bruce.

0767809246|5.0|This movie was so awesome.It is kinda sad at the end but i think they all played a great role.I think that its a five star movie and its great for someone who likes movies of reality.
630349255X|5.0|I bought the video just from word of mouth, it is always a nice feeling to know you got every penny's worth... unfortunately someone stole my copy... I'm hoping the DVD will come out soon.  The images are fabulous.
B000000H64|5.0|Pop in this CD, crank up the volume, pick up a bat, and start smashing everything!! Cause that's what this CD does for you. It'll keep you riveted throughout the whole thing. The perfect thing to help you get rid of that  anger deep inside. I've done it... And if you like Fear Factory, check out  Machinehead, another awesome band!
006016848X|4.0|I found this book to be very helpful in understanding some of the problems I have been having in my marriage.  My wife and I took turns reading it to each other which was the most useful of all.  I'm not sure whether it was  the content of the book or merely the time devoted to doing something  together (probably both) but I found this book to be very helpful.  I agree  with some other reviewers that the book is, indeed, repetitive which is a  bit annoying.  I do, however, credit this book with improving my marriage.
B00000099Y|5.0|AEnima is one of my favorite albums, I think that they did a great job  with this record. If you like the bizarre, then this is the album for you.
B000002H6C|5.0|This album is the best i've heard yet. The guys really made this album dark and deep. I was so impressed by Kirk's speed and complexity in the solo's, that I started learning how to play guitar.  I now get adrenalized  everytime I hear one of the songs off this cd.  It is so full of energy. On  a scale of 1-10, it gets a 10 1/2!!!!

Living in NYC it made me really think about those random &quot;dead ends&quot; and the gap between the subway and the platform.<br />I really wanted to visit the London Underground (and I don't  mean the subway) after reading this delightful and absorbing novel.  The  characters were well written and memorable.<br />Pick this book up and I  promise you will not want to put it down.
B000002MP2|5.0|Known to many as the album that gave Green Day popularity; fame, and money.  This album brought them out.  Not only is everyone song a clicker, but songs like Basket Case and Longview are the main songs of the album.   If you truely like Green Day buy this album.
0790738139|5.0|This was such a fantastic film.  The storyline was amazing, the development of three protagonists was astoundingly done with an awesome cast.  Unfortunately there was this little boat movie that got in the way  of the true glory deserved by this film.  Rightfully it should have won in  every category at the 1997 Academy Awards.  But the Academy Awards is  really into Awarding &quot;love stories&quot; (presumably to promote a more  glamourous view of Hollywood, the fairy tale gimmick)  But what's done is  done.  As time passes though I believe people will truly understand and  appreciate what this film did.  It raised the level for the suspense/crime  thriller, giving the genre a more sophisticated and complex approach.  I'm  sure future attempts at imitation will be undeniably bad, but at least you  can try to honor what has been done with this film.  You can only sink a  boat once.  Check this one out if you haven't already and be ready folks,  cause you gotta think...
B000001FOS|5.0|i was surprised this album was available at amazon at all ...i m impressed ! this is my favourite album of all time because it gets my emotions running like no other . ok, maybe it's  commercial - heck - like i care ! i  just LOVE it !!
0792151712|1.0|This movie should have flopped.  I have to give James Cameron credit for creating such hype for this movie.  But that's where I stop.  Why did people sit through 3 1/2 hours of oh my gosh suspense (just kidding) while  waiting for that moment when the boat splits apart and slowly starts to  sink?  Maybe they thought the boat wouldn't sink if they just watched it  enough times.  Although I have to agree it was those silly teeny bopper  girls lusting after that leo guy.  (His last good movie was The Quick and  The Dead, and guess what he dies in that one too) Maybe it's just me,  although I hope sincerely that others feel the same way, but shouldn't  tragedies be viewed as such and not profitted from?  I wouldn't have so  many complaints about this movie if it had focused on more than just the  budding romance of a young couple.  Only when the boat sinks is the  audience really aware that the boat isn't just full of rich people, only  when people start to die does the camera zoom in on their tortured faces.  But sadly, as they are not built up as real characters in the preceding 2  hours before the boat starts to go down the audience just doesn't care  about the people falling to their deaths.  (Even the woman with the baby  floating by hardly registered since I was getting impatient and waiting for  the movie to end)  So there you have it, 3 1/2 hrs, minus character  development just doesn't make for entertainment to me.  Although that Kate  Winslet is a hottie!
6304169558|5.0|Like Star Wars, this movie has a simple plot and basic characters, yet has a good message, as shown through the characters played by Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.  And, like Star Wars, there are awesome special effects, my  personal favourite being the whole sequence with the twin tornadoes and the  cow. On a different note, this movie also is quite different from other  natural disaster films, in that it is neither preachy nor especially  violent (Armageddon, Hard Rain). This is definitely a must-see movie,  especially if you have surround sound or a good quality stereo television.
B00000JCB3|1.0|It doesn't deserve even one star! Fred Durst can't sing, and Wes, or whatever his name is, is just as bad
B00000IL1K|5.0|As a new fan of Ms. Brightman's, I am most impressed with her voice.  I listen to the CD over and over.  It plays nicely during dinner parties or while reading your favorite book.  I highly recommend it.  I plan to  purchase some of her earlier work.  I only hope it is half as well done as  this.
630416923X|5.0|Wow! These guys are neat! I just saw this video for the first time yesterday and boy, was I impressed! I mean, what were those manager/record company type guys thinking, putting a group together of this magnatude?  Coolzee songs and bop-down rhythms, not to mention the neat wordplay  between Ringo, George, John and Paul.They are really charming front men. I  must say, I am a big fan of the Backstreet Boys and I was just turned onto  these beatles a few days ago. My Dad says to check out the white album,  whatever that means.
6305358567|2.0|Yes, there is tremendous darkness and violence in this movie---I don't remember ever seeing such a vivid burning at the stake in those opening moments: Cate Blanchett is wonderful---perfect to play the young Queen!Some  strange assumptions are made about the history of the period and the  Queen's character: for a better picture see Elizabeth R with Glenda  Jackson. Some of the conclusions are just too weird.A note about the  costumes: if you're going to do a story about Elizabeth and set it in a  different historical period for some effect, GREAT! but don't try to pass  off early 20th century clothes as Elizabethan. Makes my teeth grate!
B00000GAGX|5.0|A wonderful CD, with themes of cycles, seasons, winter, loss, and renewal. First and final tracks begin and end respectively with the name of the album, with a variety of  musical styles used throughout; note the unusual  time signature used in 'I hung my Head'. Every track a field of gold. Well  worth the investment.
B000002GAF|5.0|I first heard the song &quot;Brother to Brother&quot; on the radio while driving home from college in the late 70's.  I was totally blown away by the musicianship of the players and the craftmanship of the writers.  Here  was a recording that blended rock, jazz, and funk together in a way I'd  never heard before.  I went out and bought the album and have not stopped  loving it since. It is by far one of my all time favorite albums.  Gino has  managed to combine together in one recording many of my favorite musical  styles.  Thanks Gino!
B00000K19E|5.0|the special effects are some of the best ever and the plot will just leave you trippin with the view of the world as just some kind of virtual reality
0593044703|4.0|A friend who picked this book up in England mailed it to me, and I have mixed feelings about that.  I'm glad I got to see a book that I might not otherwise have found; but hope it doesn't mean that it'll be difficult to  obtain the sequels!  Finding it on Amazon gives me hope...<br />There were  times when I admired the author's willingness to drop the reader into the  middle of the world/story, and let details about the world unfold around  them; there were other times when I found it disorienting and annoying.  If  it was a conceit that was deliberate, then my advice would be that it was  only partially successful.  If the reader's viewpoint had consistently been  that of a character who shared the sense of &quot;this is all strange to  me&quot;, it might have been easier to take.  It was sometimes difficult to  feel as if you were the only person who didn't understand the ramifications  of various references, and yet you were unable to ask the questions you  would if you were on the scene.  However, I sympathize with what I might  guess is the wish to avoid needless exposition -- in a book as long as this  one is anyway, stopping every page to deliver a paragraph of explanation  might have bogged it down before it could ever get rolling.<br />A word about  orientation -- should the author or anyone in connection with the book ever  decide to peek at these online reviews, some advice.  This was a book in  which a map at the beginning wasn't just a luxury, but a necessity.   Throughout the book, too much of the comprehension of the overall plot  hinged upon references to the wider world outside of the campaign on which  the book focused.  It was a mistake, I feel, only to include a map of  Genabackis.  From the opening pages, taking place in Itko Kan, I wasted  frustrating minutes trying to place that on the map, only to understand  much later that it was off the map, elsewhere; later, I felt that it became  important to the plot to understand Genabackis' relativeposition to Unta,  or to the Seven Cities; or to understand the extent of the Empire in  relation to the world, or the lands from which the Pannion Seer might come.   <br />Without a map of the full world to help ground me, I felt as  disoriented by the invisibility of the world around Genabackis as I did by  the lack of expository stage-setting at the beginning of the book.<br />Don't  let this griping fool you into thinking that I didn't enjoy the book and  don't, as my subject line says, eagerly await more.  Despite an agreement  with another reviewer here that the names sometimes were oddly distracting,  by about the middle of the book I'd gotten used to them, and felt an  attachment to the world and its characters.  I want to find out what  happens next!
6303213650|5.0|I love all of the Cohen Brother's movies, but this is my favorite.   The little man infiltrates the monstor corporation and wins.   It's the real american dream.
0790738139|1.0|This must be a &quot;guy movie,&quot; but I'm sure there are some females who enjoyed it.  When I asked my brother if it was a good film, he said it was an &quot;intelligent&quot; film.  Intelligent?  Anytime someone tells  me a movie is &quot;intelligent&quot; I intuitively substitute the word  &quot;boring.&quot;  My gut feeling was right. When I watched it, I thought  the way some of the actors talked was pretentious with their low voices.   Were they trying to sound sexy or what?  It got on my nerves.  The  characters all struck me as phonies except for one or two guys.  But it  wasn't enough to redeem this movie in my eyes.  Maybe this is a masterpiece  to some people, but that perspective escapes me completely.
B00000J2KX|1.0|I had never seen such an incompetent job as that done by Warner Bros. when creating this DVD. The image is not much better than you get in an ordinary VCR, and the sound is absolutely terrible (which was a big turnoff for me,  as I was looking forward to hearing the awesome piece by Wendy Carlos and  Rachel Elkind booming in surround sound against the stunning background of  the mountains around the Overlook.)<br /> This DVD does The Shining (a  truly good movie that turns a run-of-the-mill horror story into a subtle  psychological-supernatural tragedy) a big disservice. <br /> The movie is  a five star one; the DVD, a one star one (and that's because I am not  allowed to give no stars.)

B0000025BL|3.0|Two songs on this album - Paradise by the Dashboard Light and Two out of Three ain't bad - are great but the others aren't so good.  However these two are so good that it's worth the price of the cd.  By the way the person  giving the one star review seems to be just one individual who keeps  visiting over and over again to try to pull down the overall rating.

B00000K2SC|5.0|What would you do if you woke up tomorrow and realized your whole life was a computer simulation?<br />Neo, a programmer for a large computer firm, finds this to be true and must transcend reality to survive.  If he fails,  superhuman agents will kill him in a heartbeat.  His only help is an  enigmatic man who shows him the truth Neo has always felt but never  known.<br />In the Matrix, this thought-provoking question's implications are  explored with eye-popping special effects expressed through a sinister plot  that should make conspiracy theorists rejoice.<br />Although this is clearly  not a movie for the timid or for children (a lot of violence in terms of  kung fu and gunplay occurs onscreen) but it is quite a compelling action  film that will leave you wondering about reality after you leave the movie.<br />Overall, The Matrix is a top-notch action flick with a thread of deep  thought binding the plot together.
068484267X|4.0|I read this book while recently travelling overseas.... there was nothing else around that was written in English!  I found it interesting and amusing - sad at times, but not depressing. I especially enjoyed the style  of writing, and found it anything but boring.  Whenever I had a few  minutes, I would pick up the book for another glimpse into Frank's  life...... perfect way to pass the time between business meetings!  I would  recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a humorous,  &quot;lite&quot; autobiography - nothing too deep or mysterious, just  day-to-day life through the eyes of a child.

Then when they throw in those little parts of the  Kingmaster himself giving those small tidbits of advise to the little  skinny kid from Texas...well it about brings tears to your eyes...If you  love the blues, kid, do not waste another second pinching that lousy dime,  this cd is worth it ten times over...just buy it!

The delicate interplay between Ivan and  Miles, Miles and Mark, Miles and Ektarin and even Ivan and Lady Alys were  delicious to read and savor.  Please, please please write faster Lois
B00001OH1S|5.0|The music is great!  Music, at least for me, can make or break a film.  If a good movie has good music it makes it just that much better.  This was a HOT movie with GREAT music!
067960085X|5.0|It was a good movie, but I was disappointed by it because the book is perfect.  Don't deprive yourself of this experience just because you saw the movie.<br />Isn't that always how it goes?
B0000048YM|5.0|If you love Barbra, you love the funny girl.  She is passionate, funny, and yes, gorgeous.  When she sings that she is the greatest star, you believe it.  When she laughs, the world laughs.  When she cries, the world  cries. This musical jump started her career, and teaches a lesson on love  and success.  Buy it.  Watch it.  Love it.
0783226063|5.0|A few places you can really notice the  dialogue is out of the sync with the actors, especially for the big monologues.  Kinda annoying, but not a deal breaker in the least.  Was it always that way?  Still an awesome movie  and a great DVD.
B000002LKF|5.0|This album is deeply moving.  It's rhythms are hypnotic and lulling, with beautiful sounds complementing Simon's gentle voice.<br />It's an album of a much more subtle beauty than 'Graceland', so don't expect the this to be  another 'Graceland', instead just lie back and be overwelmed.
0812550706|5.0|As a general rule, people either love this book or hate it.  After careful perusal of the &quot;haters&quot; category, I can summarize their reasons as follows: One: Ender has a brain, and Two: It involvs thinking, rather  than Schwarzenneger-style mindless bashing.       Many people seem to feel  that Ender is an unrealistic portrayal of a child, as he acts too much like  an adult.  Being nine years old myself, I naturally disagree.  I have  always felt that the reason children act flighty and irresponsible is  because they can get away with it (I say they because I try to act as  responsible as I can in order to combat the popular prejudice.), much like  women for far too much of history.  In the Battle School one *can't* get  away with it.  Furthermore, the whole point of the story is that Ender and  his siblings are the most incredibly brilliant people ever to walk the  Earth (or, in Ender's case, Eros).  I don't think I need to dignify the  second point with an answer.
6300214400|4.0|no trek fans must miss this compelling film
076783819X|5.0|This movie is just plain incredible.  Edge of your seat suspense, great plot twists, great ending, great movie.  Amazing amazing movie.
6304806426|4.0|I LOVE this film, but I can't give it 5 stars even though I consider it a masterpiece. Maybe I'm too critical, but I thought the acting fell short of the emotional potential of the story. My favorite actors in this movie were  Binoche and Dafoe and Naveen Andrews (Andrews says more with his eyes than  most actors can do with a thousand words!) <br />My complaint centers around  the lack of intensity between the main lovers. In some respects, this makes  a better movie in that the outward manifestations more closely parallel the  tacit emotions we act out in real life. But it is this intensity that is  central to the story. Maybe underplaying the emotional bonds was the  director's way of not telegraphing the ending to the audience. <br />But,  bottom line, I think EVERYONE should own this movie and watch it 100 times.  The multiple story lines weave in and out of each other developing two  gripping mysteries (Fiennes character and Dafoes' character) and, of  course, the main love story. The final few minutes of the movie wrap around  to the opening minutes with a perfect, heart rending, poetic symetry. One  would have to less than a complete human to not be stirred deeply by this  story of great love, betrayal, redemption, and loss.
6302206294|2.0|I did not enjoy this movie, in the least. First, in the title role, Kevin Costner is miscast. Costner does well when he plays the all-American type, but he is truly awful here.  It's not just his lack of a convincing English  accent (although even a college drama student could do a better one!) but  he is just not convincing as a swash-buckler type. Pierce Brosnan, for  example, would have made a much better Robin Hood.    I also disliked the  way that the Christian worldview and church were portrayed, as backward,  anti-science, ignorant, and hypocritical. This was done in 2 ways- by  portraying Friar Tuck as a worthless drunkard, and glorifying Morgan  Freeman's Moslem character. This is truly a distortion of history, and took  the movie into the realm of political correctness.
B0000039PW|5.0|Go buy this yo!! I aint neva heard biggy better than on dis album. Buy this!!Peace
6300214826|5.0|Many miss the point of this film.  This film is not about the Vietnam War or any war for that matter.  This film is a brilliantly artistic adaptation of The Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. Metaphors abound.  The Vietnam  war setting is merely a vehicle to show the journey of a man's descent into  the abyss and his rebirth.  Accute awareness of the animalistic instincts  that lurk inside him and the insanity surrounding him. What is good and not  good?  Why does the protagonist make the choices he does? Like others have  said, read the book, watch the movie, and learn something...maybe even  about yourself.  Also I highly recommend you see the film about making  Apocalypse Now called &quot;Hearts Of Darkness.&quot;  Equally gripping.  This film changed the way I think.
0060977493|4.0|I'm not really sure how I feel about this book.  I know I didn't hate it, but it was way too poetic for my taste.  It became so metaphorical and dream-like that I was confused and had to read paragraphs twice or three  times to try to get somewhat of an understanding.  However, Ms. Roy is a  brilliant writer and the storyline (well, the parts that I comprehended!)  was very good.  Her descriptions are very vivid and the characters are  adequately fleshed-out.  The last chapter was soooo worth it.  A very  different read.  But take your time or you'll get lost!

0671578278|5.0|I read this book three times the week I finally got ahold of it, after haunting the Baen web site for months grabbing each new section as it was posted (thanks Baen). I really hope Lois is reading these reviews and  basking in this well-deserved &quot;standing ovation&quot; -- especially if  doing so encourages her to write more Vorkosigan stories REALLY SOON.  I  only have one complaint: it's hard to read other authors' books now, as  they all seem tame if not downright dull.  Lois, you're the best by far!
0553213105|5.0|After the movie adaptations of &quot;Sense and Sensability&quot; and &quot;Emma&quot;, I always wanted to try reading one of her books.  No movie could do this author justice.  I stayed up way past midnight last  night to finish this work of art.  I had tears in my eyes by the end.
B00000K19E|5.0|Probably the best movie I have ever seen. I made me thinking the whole night after watching the movie. A stunning new idea. An absolute five star.

B000002UJQ|3.0|I like this album fine. There's some great songs (&quot;Let Down&quot; leaps to mind). However, I never listen to it. I may have listened to it ten times in the year I've owned it. It's in my stack of CDs, but every  time I think about playing it, I end up putting something else in.
B000002UAO|5.0|Frankly, what makes something great is the fact that it lives on after the generation that created it dies.  I can see someone singing or analyzing many of the Beatles' songs long before they start dissecting the songs of  anyone else.  I want, &quot;In My Life&quot; played at my wake as a salute  to the people and places I have been, much as the Beatles intended the song  to be.  This is my favorite album of all time because it captured the true  poetry of John and Paul.  I love the Stones, but frankly, when rock stars  talk about who influenced them, it usually boils down to Buddy Holly,  Elvis, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.  Rubber Soul is part of the Beatles'  evolution into history.  If nothing else, it should be in your collection  for that.

B000002UAR|5.0|When this album came out, &quot;acid&quot; music was in its infancy and this album reflects the nuances that eventually became &quot;acid&quot; rock.  The Beatles were always ahead of the game and often lead the way  which is what distinguished them from other groups like the Stones.  Great  album - almost as good as Rubber Soul.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is the most thought-provoking, life-changing movie I have ever seen.  The artistry from acting to storytelling to special effects is phenomenal.  Moss is brilliant and strong.  This group of artists is &quot;in the  moment&quot; and knows how to create something human..
068484267X|5.0|After I read the Book &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; It gave me a certain feeling, that I had never felt before while reading a book.  I had spent the better part of ten years looking for a book that gave me this  same feeling when I read it, but none of them quite did the job until I  read &quot;Angelas Ashes&quot;   Not since &quot;The Catcher in the  Rye&quot; has there been a book so poinigent and well written, and that  would make you laugh out loud on one page, and then hold back tears on the  next page.  I cant wait to read &quot;'Tis&quot; I just hope it is half as  good as &quot;Angelas ashes&quot;
B00000K2SE|5.0|This movie is the the coolest idea since the first Star Wars movie. Every penny spent on special effects was well worth it. I'm not much of a Keanu Reeves fan, but he was excellent in this role. I heard a lot of people  complain about the ending and I would just like to tell those people that  it is a trilogy. By trilogy I mean 3, this is only the first installment of  this captivating and intense cinematic experience. See it, you won't be  disappointed.
6302732875|2.0|I watched this movie some time ago and would not watch it again.  Unless you enjoy watching middle aged men ruin their careers and sink into depression I would skip this one despite the top names.
0684833395|5.0|This book is wondeful, simply wonderful. It's interplay of characters is without comparison. When one character, i.e, Colonel Cathcart is introduced as a controlling freak, the reader instantly hates him. However, a few  chapters later, one might find themeselves sympathising with his  self-loathing and desperate need for validation in the eyes of his  superiors. After reading about the chaplains pathetic humiliation, I was  angry for days afterwalds, actually snapping at people, and bringing up a  fictional character in arguements with my friends. ANY book wich can grip  you like that is a classic.<br />P.S. To the guy from 'Main Street USA', has  Vietnam actually started for you yet? You sound as though you're a lonely  50's throwback.
0375707972|5.0|I don't know why so many people gave this book such a low rating. The language is simple (I can't belive that somebody complained about it being too simple!), and there were deep underlying themes to the novel. For those  of you who thought the characters were not deep enough, I don't think the  auther intended tham to be. He wasn't just talking about Micheal and  Hannah, he was talking generally. I don't think it was Schlink's intent for  the reader to focus soley on the two main characters. As for Hannah, one  cannot understand the shame of illiteracy if one has not experienced it  themselves. I don't understand Hannah's motives for her actions (or lack of  them, I should say) or her reasons for her suicide. But for me, that did  not take away from the meaning of the story. The plot was amazing and there  were many profound statements in the novel. I highly recommend this book to  anyone who likes to read.
0800137884|4.0|this movie is great for people who like the old fasion dracula. this movie is filled with art of the past.I have read the other comments and for those other people who say this movie sucks, well, i guess some people just dont  see the art in this movie. As I said before, if you appriciate art of the  past, you will love this movie. I encourage you to at lest rent it.
B000002I25|1.0|If you are looking for great music from rock's beginning, skip this group, because the Doors are all reputation and no follow-through. If Jim Morrison hadn't been such a head case they would have been forgotten by now. There  is no rock here. They're boring. They whine. 1-Star.
B00000IO4J|1.0|this movie is stupid, the ending is really dumb and happy, awwwwwe everybodies back to normal. the characters made toooooo many assumptions that for some wierd reason all turned out right. robert, the mexican  director who only made 2 good films, ripped off The Thing(waaaay better  than this) monsters big time, only instead of using guts and viens as limbs  for cut off parts he chickened out and used tenicles. very dumb and NO  GORE!! not a single decent hacking up scene, well, when was there ever a  good gore scene in a trendy horror film?
6303149200|5.0|This is without doubt a superb piece of filmaking that sees my favourite actor the great Christopher Lee in one of his best roles and his favourite role as the pagan Lord Summerisle. Edward Woodward is superb as the upright Christian copper sent to the remote Scottish island of Summerisle to investigate the strange dissapearance of a young girl!! A task not helped by the fact that most of the islanders refuse to admit she even excisted including the girls own mother. Woodward plays Sergeant Neil Howie who soon discovers an island rife with pagan rituals and sacrifice instigated by Lee as the Lord of the island. But as mayday arrives Howie finds himself stranded on the island and the terrible truth becomes apparent as he discovers he is their sacrifice. He is then burned alive in a huge \\"wicker man\\" as Lord summerisle and the islanders dance and sing below. This is a cult classic with songs and rhymes by Paul Giovanni that are very seventies in sound but you cant help but like them! Britt ekland and Ingrid Pitt provide the nudity! This is a unique film in every way. Nothing like this has ever been made since if you like your horror films different then this is for you.
B00000099Y|2.0|I bought this album because of a couple of friends had reccommended it and said it was the best alternative/metal album of the decade. One of these friends also recommended Eels' Beautiful Freak. Since then I have sold both  albums. In retrospect, I have listened to Sonic Youth, Butthole Surfers and  Big Black (whose metal/industrial/progressive guitar rock is a lot more  interesting) after this album and realized people have been playing this  type of music for at least fifteen years (at least). How nieve of me.  Sonicaly this album is all rage and nothing seems to stop it. One giant  revenge hate fu.k. (I heard the album was the lead singer's response to  being raped as a child) Also lyrics seem to matter less when they are  screamed beneath sheets of guitar and you can't hear them. Especially if  you're angry. Oh well. What stuck in my mind most was the two spoken word  tracks &quot;die Eir Von Satan&quot; and the other track where the narrator  curses in spanish and hopes someone dies in your family real soon. That was  cool. Also a great 3-D cover. But that was it.  The album and accompanying  hype (especially from people under the age of 25) were my only exposure to  Tool. I guess I had to be a fan of Tool from the beginning and listen to  this album 500 times.
0385474547|5.0|This is a great story.  My only complaint is that it was too short!  This book tells a good, fast-moving story but is also a wonderful study of clashing cultures.  Many of the world's cultures are disappearing as they  become westernized.  We need more stories like this so that we have  something to remember.
6305546789|3.0|whats the big deal? its not a very good movie, in fact its pretty dang boring. there where way better horror films out when this came out. not scarey at all either. but ok, getting all the attention now days cause of  those stupid scream movies. go see dawn of the dead or henry&quot;potrait  of a serial killer. or HEY, even better, go see TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE,  thats the movie that started it all, not this one! made on a even smaller  really really small budget and is cool!
B000002LPD|1.0|It was the best of times,it was the worst of times. Hagar helped bring out the worst. This album proves their best days are definitely behind them. After eight years, the album seems boring and predictable, especially  comparing it to their old stuff.
079070546X|5.0|This movie has it all: Comedy, all throughout the movie; Drama, during the kidnap and police scenes,and as Clarke tries to outrun the loons in the pickup truck; adventure, as he goes looking for the perfect tree, etc.  Throughout the whole movie is the strong focus on family. Although this is  an adult-oriented movie, it is still fun for the children. I watch this  movie throughout the year, and laugh at it each and every time I do.   Clarke has never been funnier. This movie is great to watch w/the family,  because of its focus on the family, or all by oneself. Each time I see it,  I am once again back into the midst of the Christmas season, with all the  joy and family that that implies. Get it, watch it and enjoy it. You won't  regret it. I can't wait to buy it on DVD so that I can enjoy the purity of  sound and picture that that medium offers.

B000002UYZ|5.0|The 2 reviews from Sept 9 are clearly out of touch. I remember when the Beatles made their debut on the Ed Sullivan Show. They appeared 3 times in 1 month. Their sound was the transition point between Roll and Roll, Pop  and Rock music. No other band sounded like them. Very few acts produced so  many hits on each album. Most acts even today are lucky if they have 1 or 2  hits on their albums. Check out any of their original 13 albums and you  will see they have better music on any 1 of those records then most of the  garbage bands of today will have in their careers. Listen to &quot;With the  Beatles&quot; for it's raw rock &amp; roll power. &quot;Sgt Pepper's &quot;  and &quot;The White Ablum&quot; for their pure originality. Ask the critics  like Jaggar, Townshend, Page, Clapton, Gilmore, Waters, BB King, Elton John  or any of the other legends. Could they be wrong also? Most of the groups  that followed will admit that The Beatles were their biggest influence. Of  course there would have been music without them, but they lead the charge  to mainstream audiences. They harmonized beautifully, they were excellent  musicians, yes even Ringo. Who can deny that songs like &quot;I Saw Her  Standing There&quot; &quot;Don't Bother Me&quot; &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;  &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; and even standards like &quot;Mr.  Postman&quot; are great and so many more that I can not possibly name them?  Believe it or not there is only one song I do not like &quot;Revolution  9&quot; but it was an experiment. I have been fortunate enough to see  McCartney in concert at &quot;The Garden&quot; in 1989 and Giants Stadium  in 1990. Ringo Starr in 1996 at Jones Beach with his All-Starr Band. Those  shows were perfect. McCartney played about 15 Beatle songs on those shows,  the audiences went wild, average age about 40. To any of you who are not  familiar try either &quot;The Masters&quot; Vol 1 or 2. They are  compilations of all of their singles, because they arenot found on their  respective hit albums of that time. The record company felt why include the  single on the album, they assumed we had the single also. They were right.  It is hard to say which is their best album, but my first was &quot;Meet  The Beatles&quot; which on CD is called &quot;With The Beatles&quot; 2  different record companies released them Capital and Parlophone. There are  slightly different song selections on these 2 albums. If you are familiar  with the early Rolling Stones music and like it check out &quot;With The  Beatles&quot; or &quot;A Hard Days Night&quot; or &quot;Help&quot;, how can  you not say they were great? I'm long winded but I could not believe those  2 reviews. Long Live Rock as The Who says.
B000000ISO|5.0|If I could only have 1 CD for the rest of my life, this would be the ONE.  I could listen to Boston from dawn to dusk and enjoy every note, but this one is the BEST.  Critics talk of flow and other heady stuff, but I know  what I like and this is IT.  I only hope there is a fifth CD so I have a  decision to make.
B00000ILDE|5.0|The transfer is awesome, the interactive menus are cool, but this has nothing on the LD. The extra scenes are here, some of the bonus material is here, but you ain't seen nothin' yet. The Laserdisc contains hundreds of  pages with changes to the script, poroduction details down to minutia. Most  people don't care to step through this kind of detail which takes hours and  hours to view. For those who do, its an invaluable look into the heart and  soul of moviemaking. The $20.00 tag on the DVD is much friendlier to the  average consumer than the $100.00 I paid for my LD set. The LD format is  not as user friendly either, and really shows its age next to the DVD.  There are 6 disk sides. You have to flip them over every 20 minutes because  they are in high speed. That really sucks. I now have a auto reverse player  so that takes half the work out, but having the movie interrupted every 20  minutes just blows. The DVD is far superior in this regard. Maybe you can  find a LD in the library or used book store just for the text, and buy the  DVD for the best of both worlds.
B000002JSJ|5.0|One star rating... are you serious? This is seriously one of their finest - very progressive and just as great as any of their other albums.
0783226837|5.0|Great B-movie with A-budget. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward play great hillbillies with dreams of a better life. The creatures are of an awesome and very realistic design. The behind the scenes are very cool as well.  Probably half an hour long detailing of the production. The featurette is  only 5-10 minutes. The profiles are only a couple of minutes long and are  comprised mostly of the same shots as the featurette and behind the scenes  film. The production notes are only five pages or so. The is no commentary  track, which is my favorite thing about a special edition. All on all, for  $27.99, this is a bargain. This would cost $100.00+ on laserdisc. Now, if  only these things would contain tons of text. If you have seen the Jim  Cameron LDs you'll know what I'm talking about. Hundreds of pages,  interspersed with storyboards and video interviews describing the process  that almost every frame of film went through. I have yet to see a DVD with  near that kind of detail. Still, this is a good example of where DVDs are  today. Be sure to fill out your oppinion card that comes with this title  and write in &quot;More behind the scenes and production notes&quot;.
0790729628|5.0|My favorite movie of all time. I can't believe this was done in the early 80's...the technology (to me) is competable with that of this decade. The acting is superb. The story is fantastic. The music fits perfectly and the  lonely atmosphere of the futuristic LA sends chills down your spine. TAKE A  LOOK AT THIS FANTASTIC MOVIE!!!
6305311463|5.0|The biggest blockbuster of the summer has the reason why DVD was invented. All the frills are here. 2, count them, 2 commentaries. Both are engaging and informative. It has a gag reel with plenty of laughs, trailers,  Aerosmith video, etc. I don't know why they decided to go with 2 DVDs as  the material only takes up one side of each. Probably just so they could  sell the cool box. I was impressed with all the material. If you were to  buy a set like this on Laserdisc. Oh yeah, the  movie is cool too. It has emotional impact, although not quite on the  intimacy level of Deep Impact. The special effects are extraordinary.
0783233477|5.0|Wow, what a surprise!  I usually watch action movies such as Aramgeddon, Bad Boys, Strange Days, and Star Wars, so I had absolutely no interest in watching this film.  My mom kept telling me how great it was, so when she  said she had watched it three times in two weeks, I knew there had to be  something to it.  Let me tell you, I was hooked right from the beginning,  and captivated until the very end.<br />This movie makes you remember that it  is the people you love that make life worthwhile.  I thought about my  deceased grandfather, and my former wife in particular.  But it only made  me recall all the good, happy times with them, and jsut kind of reminded me  of what is important in life.<br />It's really hard to describe this film, and  explain what it is that enamored me, but all I can say is JUST WATCH  IT.<br />I think the reason this movie did poorly at the theater is because  the trailer does not portray accurately what it is about.  After watching  the film, I watched the trailer on the DVD, and said, &quot;That is not the  movie I just watched.&quot;
B000005S37|5.0|This is true of all art forms. Parisians rioted when they first heard Stravinsky's &quot;Rite of Spring,&quot; a work that still raises hackles 86 years later. Bear in mind that MMM was *willful*. There are tens of  thousands of unlistenable albums that were earnest attempts at  entertainment, even art. MMM may not be one of the &quot;best&quot; albums  ever made but it is one of the &quot;greatest.&quot;
B000002KHH|5.0|&quot;War Pigs/Luke's Wall,&quot; &quot;Paranoid,&quot; &quot;Iron Man,&quot; and &quot;Electric Funeral.&quot; THESE ARE THE GREATEST HEAVY METAL SONGS OF ALL TIME!!! They are classic! They are timeless! They are  destructive! They are hard-hitting, heart-pounding, mind-shattering heavy  metal GODS!!! Black Sabbath were (are) the greates heavy metal band of all  time. Sure Led Zeppelin paved the way with a harsher sound, and Hendrix  introduced the distortion and showmanship, but Sabbath took it to the  ultimate extreme that only the really good bands like Metallica and Judas  Priest have been able to at least partially emulate. This is the ESSENTIAL  heavy metal album. &quot;PARANOID&quot; is an entity unto intself, doomy,  harsh, and it shows that Sabbath were more than hard-playing maniacs. They  had talent! If you are a fan of great classic heavy metal, this is the  album!!!
B00000IPAX|1.0|This CD is one of the best examples of what not to sound like if you study a musical instrument or are learning to sing. Of course, BLINK 182 does not do either, but that is just the reality of modern music. The masses have  accepted music made by so-called musicians that cannot sing or play  instruments well. However, I guess the masses have no choice much of the  time. Too bad, isn't it?
B00000J7RZ|1.0|Don Johnson's album is better than this.  she is clearly a one hit wonder, she is a studio creation that can not write or sing her own music. She is not a true artist, shes an actress pretending to be a singer.  I should  have known better than to buy her album, especially since she lip synced in  the Selena movie. I can not name more than one song on her album that i  like, If You had my love was Ok. she is jumping on the bandwagon of the  latin craze and is doing a bad job at it.  For everyones sake lets hope her  first album is her last!
B00000JCB2|1.0|I bought this piece of crap and took it right back! I really wish Amazon had a rating of zero stars. One could really use that for much of what is being touted as great music these days. Anybody remember Led Zeppelin? Now  that was a great band that made great music. Zeppelin was a band of  musicians that could write, sing, and play very well, which is much unlike  Limp Bizkit and so many of the modern bands. One of the biggest problems  with modern bands is that the musicians rely way too much on vibe and look.  Another problem I see is that the musicians don't have a good grasp of  music history, whether it's modern or classical history. However, I guess  that's the 90s and the MTV influence.
B000002UB3|5.0|This is the last word from the Fab Four!  Chronologically this is the end of the line for Beatles studio projects with all four members present.  <br />It seems futile to debate over which Beatles album was the  &quot;best&quot;.  It's amusing to read the comments of those who root for  &quot;Pepper,&quot; or &quot;Revolver,&quot; or &quot;Rubber Soul,&quot; or  whatever. Looking back at the Beatles career as a whole, it's pretty  obvious that the band was constantly changing.  The only constant with the  Beatles was change.  By the time they recorded an album, mastered it, and  got it put on the shelves, they were already off into something new while  we were tearing the shrink-wrap off the latest recording.  <br />&quot;Abbey  Road&quot; shows where the band was at in the summer of 1969.  When I  originally bought the album in the fall of that year, as a  sixteen-year-old, I loved it.  It reflected the times perfectly just like  all the other Beatles albums did.  Little did I know the intensity of the  rancor and disintegration going on in the group at the time.  Little did I  know that in less than six months the Beatles would breakup. All I knew at  this precious time, at the close of the decade that the Beatles reflected  and influenced beyond all estimation, was that I loved their latest album  and mused on what wonderful record they would come up with next.  Of  course, that record never came.<br />I think you need to look at Beatles  albums as sign-posts marking a journey's progression.  The journey ended  with &quot;Abbey Road.&quot;  Who knows where we would've gone if the  journey had continued?  After thirty years I'm still wondering.
B000002UAR|4.0|This could have been a great album, if it hadn't been for Paul McCartney. John and George's songs are flawless, some of their finest ever, but I don't think we ever needed the sentimental &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; or the  childish singalong &quot;Yellow submarine&quot;. Still, this ranks third in  my list of favourite Beatles records. &quot;Taxman&quot;, &quot;She Said  She Said&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; shine today as they did  33 years ago. 1966 was an awesome year for rock music (&quot;Pet  Sounds&quot; and &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; also came out that year), and  this album easily ranks among the finest records of all times.
0767802659|1.0|Whoever this movie appeals to - and there seem to be a lot of you out there - I doubt if many of them are Heinlein fans. To take just two things that are drastically wrong with the movie:<br />1. &quot;Starship  Troopers&quot; without powered suits is like &quot;Midway&quot; without  aircraft carriers. It's a completely different story. If Verhoeven couldn't  hack the powered suits - and I find that hard to believe - he should have  left the story till the technology caught up. The whole idea is that the MI  have superior equipment, which makes up for lack of numbers.<br />2. The  &quot;anti-fascist satire&quot; angle involves either completely (wilfully)  misunderstanding everything Heinlein was trying to say, or simply ignoring  it. What Verhoeven portrays as &quot;fascism&quot; is what Heinlein was  recommending! He was pointing out that you can't stay free indefinitely  unless you are willing to fight. That fighting involves a good chance of  dying, and people who aren't willing to take that chance don't deserve to  enjoy the benefits. This is a familiar theme to Americans - &quot;the tree  of liberty must be watered with the blood of patriots&quot; - although it  is deeply unfashionable right now.<br />Bottom line - Verhoeven and his crew  took a brilliant SF novel with a great action plot and some very deep moral  ideas behind it, and turned it into a sad quasi-futuristic horror story  that makes &quot;Alien&quot; look sophisticated.
0517702967|5.0|At first, I thought It would be only third twin. I got much surprises when I read the rest of the book. Highly recomended.
6301543408|3.0|This is inferior to Star Trek II and IV and others, but much better than The Motion Picture and Insurrection  -- it places number 7 out of   9. The scene where we learn about the things that have haunted Spock and McCoy is  great.  We finally know why McCoy is so irritable:  he let his father die  right before a cure to his disease was found.  I love the idea of giving  his anger a definite source.  And Kirk's line about &quot;needing his  pain&quot; was a highpoint, also.

B000002HRE|4.0|While Re-Load isn't Metallica's best album (that title goes to Ride the Lightning, IMHO), it's not at all bad. &quot;Fuel&quot; is a terrific opener, Marianne Faithful's backing vocals on &quot;Memory Remains&quot;  are cool, and &quot;Better Than You&quot; is a great rocker. I saw  Metallica at Woodstock '99 and they were as heavy as ever (Kirk and James  have grown their hair back, too). While this shouldn't be the first  Metallica album to get, it is still a very good album. It's no sell out,  otherwise they'd be doing rap-metal.
6304057709|5.0|This movie is one of the best! It is in the rankings with &quot;Elizabeth&quot; and &quot;Shakespere in Love.&quot;  This is my favorite time period for movies.  The part that Kate Winslet plays is her  best. A younger sister who is looking for true love in all the wrong  places.  She ends up relizing  true love is right under her nose. This is a  family movie or a movies for couples. It is guarenteed to satisfy the  viewer!
B00001MXXG|5.0|Ferris Beuller is without doubt the best film John Hughes made in his career.  While admittedly it is not the finest piece of cinema to be released in the U.S, its lively, funny, charming, and most importantly, its  damn funny.  If you want to see a great teen comedy before the genre was  ruined by the current teen-slasher craze, you could do far worse than  giving ferris a try.
B00000J7RZ|1.0|I advise anyone who likes music not to buy the album, the only good song is &quot;If you had my love&quot; than they just kept getting worse, &quot;waiting for tonight&quot; was so bad the words were ridiculous and  its mostly sung by back up singers, and than her duet with marc anthony is  really bad if i could i would return the album. don't buy it, trust me.
6305470464|1.0|At the end of the two hours I wasted watching this manipulative, meaningless, maudlin movie, I wished I had those two hours back.  It was a tear-jerker in the worst way; it was obviously going for the two-Kleenex  box crowd, but brought only a little nasal congestion (no tears) to my  usually highly-emotional girlfriend, and I felt sad in exactly one spot of  the movie. About 1 hour and 59 minutes prior to the end of the movie, we  both knew the underlying theme of the movie, and how it would end. The  characters are all distinctive, but contrived. The only bright spot is Sean  Connery, who can do no wrong. RUN (do not walk) away from the shelf in the  video store where this video is lurking - waiting for some poor,  unsuspecting victim to walk by.
B00000J7J4|5.0|Kudos to Arista President Clive Davis for putting this together! A simply sensational and diversified output accented by Carlos's blazing guitar on practically every track. A bunch of grammies are probably in store for this  one!
B0000024SN|5.0|I am only 17 years old and I love this CD!  This is by far Simon and Garfunkel's Best CD, there is no skipping tracks to get to the ones you like because they are all awesome.  For anyone who likes this legendary duo  must buy this album.
0345404475|5.0|While the plot is quite interesting, the thing I enjoyed most about this novel was the way PKD was able to shape the world. Every detail is thought out in its entirety in his mind and transfered to paper. The Man in the  High Castle does this even better and I strongly recommend it.
0767824571|5.0|A very funny movie.  I can watch it over and over again!  Excellent!<br />The video transfer on this DVD is superb.  Considering the age of this film it is quite amazing.  The colors are vibrant and not washed out like when the  movie is shown on Comedy Central.<br />Not really any extras included on the  disc, but still worth owning.
0812589041|5.0|Simply put, Ender's Game is my favorite science fiction novel ever. Does this mean that it is the best Sci-Fi novel ever written? Not necessarily. However, I cannot contemplate what type of person could not relate to the  endearing, yet abbrasive EnderWiggin. Card's characters alone make this  worthy of your time. It doesn't hurt that there's a masterpiece of a plot  backing the characters up, one that's continued in the other excellent  books in the series. Give it a try...
B000001E18|5.0|everyone has an opinion. if you enjoy U2 you should at least admire it and like it. everyone else should listen to it at least twice, most likely you'll LOVE it. truly a landmark album of texture and sound- a commentary  on the world around us given to us by a group so unique and forceful(not to  mention creative) that most others pale. tell me LEMON isn't a song that  you CAN'T feel emotion about!
6303327982|1.0|If you like cleaning garbage cans, you'll love it! I couldn't even finish it completely, just gave up on it finally.  I did not see a point to this movie, and the plot seemed to be just how much violence and depravity they  could show.  Makes me wonder about the sanity of the director.  Maybe  that's the way he sees &quot;hell&quot;.  Fuggedaboudit!
0425170349|1.0|Gave up after about 280 pages - no research done at all. Mr Clancy should use some of his money to take a trip to some of the places he set the action. There is no ambassador in Geneva (Bern is the capital of  Switzerland). Bern airport is a well mown field. BA do not fly to Bern.  There is no highway from the airport to the town. There are no school near  banks in the centre of Bern. Etc. (see review regarding Sydney also) In  this day and age why does the guy have to smoke (a pipe) after operations.  I echo other reviews about the length of the book - could have been written  in half the number of words. Unless you think Clancy is the ONLY writer on  the planet don't buy this book - if sales are low enough maybe he will try  harder next time.
B00000K19E|5.0|Saw it on the big screen and have ordered the dvd. It is a mind-blowing thrill ride into a world that is not so far-fetched from reality given the technologies today and in the near future.  It exudes intelligence, doesn't  tease or ridicule and allows you to get away from life as you know it for a  couple of hours.  Special effects are the best I have ever seen.  A well  put together cast and story.  A must see for any adult...&quot;gamers&quot;  will walk away twitching and have bad dreams for a month!   Incredible  camera work and the feel of the sets are so real, dark and mysterious.  Big  brother of the future meets billy bad-*** hacker!  See who wins!
6304362498|4.0|From the opening scenes of this film, I knew I was in for a treat!  Not many films leave knots in my stomach long after the credits roll like it did in '1984'.  Having previously read the book helped immensely  (especially towards the ending). However, the book was not able to portray  the horrific and unshakable images of a person being brutally tortured!  I  felt awful as I watched this human being suffer to that extreme(and it was  only a movie!).  I must say I didn't &quot;enjoy&quot; the movie, and would  most likely shudder at just the idea of watching it again.  Although I  geatly admire the film for making me feel that way, because the filmmakers  obviously made their point.  Wonderful job on the adaptation and directing.   Not to mention superb acting, cinematography, and musical score. Stanley  Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' was the only other movie that left me with  these feelings and images left in my mind.  But after viewing '1984' only  once, I must say Kubrick's film doesn't hold a candle to Orwell's classic,  nightmatish Utopian society.  Do not be misled by the first half of the  film.  It takes a drastic and nasty turn in the second which is definetly  NOT for the squeamish.  Overall, the movie is a well-made and unforgettable  adaptation that reaches its important message.
6304082428|5.0|This series is the most faithful to the book I have ever seen.  The costumes are also more historically acurate than in other productions.  The actors portrayal of the characters, very faithful indeed.  I have loved  this story for years, and while the book is always better (my personal  opinion) I have watched this series many a time, and enjoy it always.
B000002L7R|5.0|Another piece of work that makes Prince the person he is today. Although Pop Life and Rasberry Berret were the biggest hits on the album, my personal favorite is Condition of the heart. Overall, this is an excellent  follow-up to Purple Rain.
B000002IZM|4.0|Vangelis has really only made two good albums, and perhaps only one-and-a-half.  As all of this album is good, I'll leave it up to you to wonder where the other half is...I agree with those who've pointed out that  this still isn't anywhere near a complete recording of the soundtrack, and  that the selections and mixing are somewhat quizzical.  I haven't really  heard a good bootleg, and I didn't realize they were all pretty bad  quality.  This is pretty good, though.  The dialogue is both good and  bad--some of it belongs, some of it doesn't.  As for &quot;One More Kiss,  Dear&quot;, it is a little out-of-place, but it does help establish  mood--and if you're paying attention, you might notice that it's the song  playing in the background at Decker's flat when Rachel first stops by!
B00000JPHD|4.0|Director Tod Browning's \\"Dracula\\" (1931) features a classic Bela Lugosi performance in a mostly stagebound film. However, Philip Glass' new score (beautifully performed by the Kronos Quartet) elevates the film from  its theatrical origins and adds a new dimension to Browning's static  atmospherics.  Of course, Glass' music cannot rectify the film's occasional  flaws, yet the score makes \\"Dracula\\" a more rewarding and  satisfying experience.
0671578278|5.0|Ms. Bujold has done it again. She consistently writes marvellous books and continues to develop her characters. When I first read &quot;Komarr&quot;, I finished it absolutely starving to find out what happens next and the  last year has been torture waiting. Now I  can give my copy of  &quot;Komarr&quot; a rest and reread &quot;A Civil Campaign&quot; over and  over until the next installment. I bet I'm not the only reader who has  fallen in love with Miles; if only he knew how many women were out there  for him! This is a delightful book, filled with romance, wit, intelligence,  and lots of humor. I stayed up all night devouring it. Ms. Bujold, if you  read this, please don't make us wait too long for the next book.
6303617719|5.0|Reasons to watch it:  Kline is hilarious, Ryan is fantastic, supporting actors are terrific and the scenery is beautiful!  Just an all-around enjoyable movie experience.  One of my favorites!
0345308239|3.0|The author defines folly very clearly as self-defeating behavior, although I didn't expect maxims from an accompished historian.
B000002BHE|5.0|Her CD is very much impressive.  It got me shocked breathtakingly from the very begining of the CD play making me feel comfortable.   It doesn't disappoint me to the end of the play.   Celine Dion sings as beautiful as  crystal and strong like storm but so sad.  She lets us know how our life  is.  And gets into our hearts to relieve much tension from our daily life  promissing us that our life is beautiful no matter how hard it is.  Now we  are on the way of making drama with her.
B00000JY1X|4.0|For obvious reasons, I would not suggest &quot;69 Love Songs&quot; as an album for someone to be introduced to the Magnetic Fields. It's sprawling. It jumps genres with almost every song. It's also not as concise as some of  their earlier albums like &quot;Get Lost&quot;, or &quot;Charm of the  Highway Strip&quot;. That being said, this album is really incredible. I  left work early for lunch one day and got it and I don't think it's left my  CD player since. I found myself laughing at how good some of the songs are.  I wouldn't say I love every song on all three discs, but I like at least  two-thirds of the songs on each disc, which comes up to be a lot of songs I  really like. I was a little wary about the other people singing on there,  but I managed to see the Magnetic Fields at Mergefest in Chapel Hill  (managed sounds a little strong considering I live there), and the other  singers were able to sing Stephen Merritt's songs beautifully. All in all,  it's a great album. More diverse than previous ones although still  containing a wealth of songs you will find yourself humming along to within  the first listen.
B000002J09|5.0|First, I'd like to say that this is an amazing piece of work. Granted, the album as a                            whole isn't as cohesive as Houses or Physical Graffiti, but this one stands perfectly                             well on the merits of the music alone. Every song on this one is  amazing!<br />                           And why are people comparing Led  Zeppelin to Pink Floyd and the Beatles? We're not                             just talking apples and oranges here, we're talking peaches, elephants,  and city buses                            (you can decide for yourself  which is which... =) Led Zeppelin at their best were                             primarily a BLUES band, Pink Floyd defies any classification (but  certainly FAR from                            the blues...), and the  Beatles pretty much wrote folk/pop. No, no, no. It just makes no sense to  make                            comparisons here. Zeppelin, Floyd, and the  Beatles were probably the 3 most popular                            bands  of this half of the century, and for good reason. They were all great, but  in                            different styles and for very different  reasons. <br />                           I will agree that Wish You Were Here  (floyd's best, i think) is a far superior as a                             whole-album concept, but you can't possibly ignore the great music on this  album. A                            must-have for anyone who's into blues  or straight grassroots Rock 'N' Roll.<br />                           If  you're looking for something more musically developed and mature, Led Zep's  later                            work is also fantastic (though they never  again reached the dizzying heights of Stairway                             to Heaven and When the Levee Breaks). I'm sure you've heard of Houses of  the Holy                            and Physical Graffiti... but Presence  is also fantastic (Achilles Last Stand is aMASTERPIECE!), and tragically overlooked.
B000001GXC|5.0|These two symphonies were recorded in 1971, and 1973 - Karajan's best and happiest years. Not so &quot;perfect sound&quot; minded like in the sixties, Karajan has shifted into capturing the spirit of the music. The  Italian symphony is pure bursting happiness and vitality, the scottish  symphony is deeper, more introspective, as is the Herbides overture. This  recording, particularly of the Italian symphony, is a must have.
B000002UAF|5.0|This is the beatles most consistent album, every song is good
B000001G89|1.0|First, I want to emphasize that opera is a total work. Singer, orchestra and conductor have an equal responsibility to make a great piece. What lacks from this Carmen? It's simple, Abbado gave another boring job. If you  want to feel real Carmen, try Karajan's two versions. I personally prefer  the old one bue new one is more likelyh to be trendy one.  I want to say  one more. Afrer his inauguration with Berliner, Abbado is simply overrated.  He is noting but a simple OK conductor. Muti is the best living opera  conductor.
B000002UAR|5.0|What can I say about one of the most highly respected albums and bands the world has and will ever know.  The Beatles manage to remain number one thru 4 decades of musical change, what does this say about them other than they  are simply great.  I wish music today was this inovative.  For all those  that pan the album because of &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, I say go to  hell.  Do you think the Beatles expected this song to be the defining song  on the album, hell no.  And even so, it was still a commercial success  (along with all of there songs and albums).  Look at Elenor Rigby, or I'm  only Sleeping, or Here there and everywhere.  Those are just simply great  songs.  Those that say that the Beatles copied The Beach Boys are out of  their tree.  Why did Brian Wilson lock himself in his room for a month when  Sgt.Pepper's was released.  The fact is the Beatles were the inovators and  will always be the key driving force of Popular and great music for  generations to come.
0783235380|5.0|This movie is about a young man about to get married. He is going by plane to the southern u.s. But his plane has a mishap and cannot leave. He calls home,but is intruppted by a young woman (sandra Bullock) . Eventually it  turns into a road trip with the two young people trying to get home to  where they need to be. One scene in the movie has Sandra and Ben in a gay  bar(where he partial strips) to earn some money for the way back home. They  also run into friends of Ben's (aslo in the wedding party) along the way  home. They encounter various mishaps but eventually the find their way back  home. There is also a hurricane or a tropical storm which is is kinda  pivotal to plot (if you think about human nature) This movie has partial  nudity,drug use and swearing!But overall it is a good movie if you can  stand the films stars! on a sad note during the release in theaters one of  the stars commited sucide(he has the one trying get the girl from ben back  at home while was on his way back home!!)
B000001GBJ|5.0|From start to finish,this cd will transport to another world. Beautiful melodies and haunting vocals just go right to your soul. If your looking for something to relax with you can not go wrong with this cd,or for that  matter,anything by Secret garden. It is worth every penny!!!
0783225970|5.0|Brian De Palma's &quot;Scarface&quot; is one of the greatest gangster films of all time. It is wonderfully stylish and gritty.Al Pacino is ruthless and intense. The screenplay by Oliver Stone is wonderfully crafted  with some really interesting characters. This is an amazing study of the  underworld of crime. &quot;Scarface&quot; reaches a level of powerful movie  making that few films capture. It is, one of the only gangster films that  equals to &quot;The Godfather.&quot; The score by Giorgio Moroder (Midnight  Express) is equally effective and thrilling. This is also, a film of  images. Everything has a touch of style. The costumes, the sets, the  people, all are full of style. I have seen &quot;Scarface&quot; dozens of  times and it never fails to give it's impact. It is realistic in the way it  portrays the mob underworld and solves the problem where the bad guy  doesn't need to be a hero. &quot;Scarface&quot; is a powerful masterpiece.
0790729733|5.0|Oliver Stone's powerful masterpiece, &quot;JFK,&quot; is an extremely important film that I believe that everyone should watch. It is a detective story, it looks deep into one of history's greatest engimas. But  &quot;JFK&quot; is also a stunning study of politics and power and how  power works. Stone's film is full of a lot of information, visual images,  interesting dialogue, and opens the mind to thinking and searching. We must  not always trust official history. &quot;JFK&quot; displays that evil can  also lurk in the most clean-looking places. In this case, our government,  our system of power and control. &quot;JFK&quot; is also a technical  achievement. The editing, the music, the camera shots are all flawlessly  done. I watched &quot;JFK&quot; and never looked at official government  explanations the same way again. Look at what recently happened with Waco,  now we know that the FBI probably did more wrong than good. &quot;JFK&quot;  is a powerful document that should be watched by all Americans who care  about the truth, and justice. It should also be seen by all interested in  the workings of power.
6305470448|5.0|Than this of Juliet and her Romeo. Brilliant and Joseph Fiennes should have been nominated for an Oscar as well! I will definatley add this to my video collection along with Elizabeth!
6304118406|5.0|Oliver Stone's &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; is a slap on America's face. It portrays our fascination with violence and today's society. It is not so much about violence, but about how today's society embraces  violence. This of course, means we are going down a dark road. Maybe  somtimes Littleon Colorados are needed to wake us up. The same can be said  about Oliver Stone's amazing, thrilling, and powerful film. There isn't as  much violence as we think there is. It's the intense feeling of the movie.  &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; is an intense study of the 90's national  sport: Crime. Those who call it too violent don't see the message, only the  gore. This is, a masterpiece in filmmaking.
078322933X|5.0|I'm sorry but those that dis Wahlberg acting are obviously incredibly jealous.  He can be charming,  macho,  angry,  wacky,  and SEXY. This movie is predictable if you consider Single White Female,  Fatal Attraction,  and  The Hand That Rocks the Cradle predictable,  but who cares...it was still  EXTREMELY SUSPENSEFUL!
1558908455|2.0|It's not the worst vampire film I've ever seen but it't not that good either. Lots of pointless violence in a remarkably silly plot with acting that's so-so at best.
0783216084|4.0|Yes, Jaws is the beachside thriller and yes, I watch it for the conjuring up of a visceral scare that is comparable only to showering with Norman Bates nearby but . . .<br />Why is the sun setting in East in the opening  credits, why (or how) does the chain hooked to the rump roast of the old  fisherman on the pier lead out for 50 feet when the shark snags the roast  and then shorten dramatically (by forty-five feet) once the pier is pulled  into the water and the shark nearly nabs the fisherman floundering to  shore, or, worse, the town of Amity spring for Quint's shabby boat when  they've Hooper's spanking new cruiser with all the latest in techno-gear,  or worser, how does Hooper escape a mauling Great White that has just torn  open his shark cage and hide on the ocean bottom?  C'mon, Steven -- stuff's  gotta add up, right?
6304711905|5.0|This film in it's on right to me is legendary. I was most overwhelmed by Val Kilmer's role as Doc Holiday. This film is a MUST SEE for lovers of the old west and the story of these four companions.
0783225733|5.0|This is by far Ron Howard's best work.  Not only was the filming done in as realistic manner as possible, but terrific editing work leave the film devoid of empty spots.  Each scene meaningfully contributes to the story,  and each shot.<br />In addition to first-rate direction, there are many strong  performances in this film, chief of which is Ed Harris's protrayal as the  unflappable Flight Director, Gene Krantz and Gary Sinise as left-behind  astronaut Ken Mattingly.  The rest of the cast is solid as well, but Harris  and Sinise shine.<br />The film took great pains to be accurate in the  recreation of the setting, as did &quot;Titanic&quot;, but far exceeded  &quot;Titanic&quot; in the accuracy of its execution.  There were a couple  of places where license was taken (such as the vantage point Mattingly had  during the launch; noone would have benn allowed anywhere near that  location), but were noted by Ron Howard in his commentary.<br />This DVD is  the complete package and includes a lot of stuff that will aid in  understanding both the mission and the movie:  &quot;The Lost Moon&quot; a  'making of' feature; running commentary by Ron Howard on how the movie was  made; running commentary by Jim Lovell on what actually happened during the  mission; and a the theatrical trailer.<br />All DVDs should have these  features, as it really enhanced the total experience of the film.  It also  makes releases that lack such features pale by comparison.<br />If you have  any interest in the space program at all, this is a &lt;must have&gt;!
B00000JCB2|4.0|What an album! if you think Korn is good well this takes it's place as my favourite CD. Great tracks all the way through if you like punk music.Stop reading the reviews and go get it!
B00000IN5G|5.0|Melodic sound, soaring lead solos, excellently executed songs. They redefined the genre up to another level, and Laiho's guitar solos are so wicked, that he makes other guitarists of the 90's embarrassed. They could  say that he's an Yngwie-clone, but the way he execute those notes makes him  far better than the Viking God of Shred.
0780627024|5.0|Pleasantville is one of those rare movies that dares to make you think, that dares to challenge what you believe and how you view the world.  One might say that the allusions to racism or stereotyping of anyone with  strict morals are slightly overdone.  But only by bludgeoning us with this  imagery can the director ever hope to get the movie's central theme through  to us.  And most won't get it, or will be too offended to even understand  where it's coming from.  That's quite a shame really, as it is a fantastic  movie with an uplifting moral message and superb acting performances.  Go  see it!  Love it or hate it, try to understand what it's getting at.
0767809270|3.0|I suppose it is a big deal for a star like Hanks to stand up before a camera and say, &quot;I am gay, I have AIDS.&quot;  I just wish it had happened in a better film.  Hanks won an Oscar for his performance as a gay  lawyer with AIDS, the first of two in a row.  His performance here is all  right--but does not compare to his work in &quot;Big&quot; or &quot;Apollo  13&quot;.  His part is paper-thin in &quot;Philadelphia&quot;.  The true  great performance in this move comes from Denzel Washington, as an  ambulance chaser who does not know how he feels about homosexuals or the  man he represents in court.  The part and the performance have complexities  that Hanks doesn't even have the opportunities to explore.  If you want to  see an excellent film about the hazards of being gay and having AIDS, watch  &quot;Jeffery,&quot; starring Patrick Stewart (Jean-Luc Picard of TV's  &quot;Star Trek: the Next Generation&quot;).  If you want to see the best  performance of 1993, see Liam Neeson in &quot;Schindler's List.&quot;  If  you want to see the first major star to play a gay man with AIDS, see this  one.
0440219078|5.0|I really liked this book. The plot was so original that no one has even come close to having a similar plot. It made me appreciate discisions and memories, and the fact that the way we live is very free.
0792140923|3.0|When I first saw this movie, I was moved--it was funny and sad.  I felt that Tom Hanks' performance was one of the best I'd seen.  I was dazzled by the idea that so much of the film was done through computer manipulation.   I was 14 years old.  Five years after the fact, the film has not aged well.   There are inspired notes--I still enjoy the sequence where Forrest runs  across America several times--but they are outweighed by bad puns and  clunking dialogue.  Forrest stupidly showing his rear end to LBJ, or  serving as the inspiration for John Lennon's song &quot;Imagine&quot;, or  telling Jack Kennedy that he needs to evacuate his blatter--these things  are no longer amusing.  The film has lost its lustre.  I still admire  Hanks' nuanced and subtle performance, but he was better as a little boy  trapped in a man's body in &quot;Big&quot; and as rock-solid James Lovell  in &quot;Apollo 13&quot;.  Gary Sinise pumps as much as he can into the  cliched Lt. Dan, but he, too, has been better elsewhere (see his  magnificent performance as George in &quot;Of Mice and Men,&quot; which he  also directed); the effort is honorable but even his considerable talents  cannot redeem the part.  The film is not a total waste; if you can get past  the conservative sloganeering disguised as liberal babbling, and the  occasional idiocy of the script, the film has its moments.
B0000069NM|5.0|Outstanding use of guitar.  A must for your smooth funk collectio
B000000WFZ|5.0|This is one of the best classical soundtracks I've ever heard!!! Buy it, listen, you'll love it.<br />Sarah Brightman just put words to one of the best songs on this cd. check that out also.
B00000K501|5.0|Grrrrr...When you attend or watch a Rammstein show, you have to take it as a total package.  Buck Dich and all.  A rammstein live show is a theatrical experience, made more so by the fact that they don't really pause between  songs, there's no political diatribe or &quot;Hello Berlin Are you ready to  rock&quot; crap.  They come out, assume their characters and play.  Buck  Dich is one of the most fascinating parts of the show, and it must be  experienced.
B00000IBRX|5.0|This movie struck a deep chord.  Held our attention throughout; excellent graphics, concept, acting - plausible yet fantastic.  Both my spouse and I recommend it heartily.
6304697961|3.0|The movie is a Halloween Classic, however only the video trailer would play sound. I tried 3 different copies on 2 different Sony 3000 Model DVD players and got the same resultes.  Im hopefull and the new limited release  has this corrected.
B000002UAF|5.0|My reactions to the songs on this album - <br />A Hard Day's Night: I am energized by the song, it is one of the most upbeat songs I know.<br />I Should Have Known Better: makes me feel sad, melancholic. Touching  song.<br />If I Fell: Beautiful harmonies, delicate, sensitive piece.<br />Tell  Me Why: I love the way John Lennon calls back and forth between him and the  rest of the band in this one... he really lets loose when the backbeat  flies off and his voice and the rhythm in his voice flies off with  it.<br />Any Time At All: Since I was a child this song has touched me, and  taught me about compassion and empathy for other people.                                                    I'll Cry Instead: This song tells me about  not facing up to your problems, particularly when you've lost a lover.                                                    Things We Said Today:  Very  thoughtful song which reminds me of break-ups and arguments with girl  friends, and the regret you feel afterwards for the harsh things you've  said that you wish you hadn't.                                                    You Can't Do That:  This song (this version and the one on the  anthology series) start off with an incredible guitar lick, which is  quickly complimented by a backbeat which just carries you off in a magical,  emotion drenched, tragic, hurt, wounded angel poem of lost love and  disrespect of a past lover.                                                    I'll Be Back: incredible acustic guitar opens this, then complimented by  smooth voices, calming and melancholic.
B00000DHRZ|3.0|By far the best song on this CD is Why Don't You Get a Job?. It's an addicting song, you want to listen to it over and over again...LOUDLY!!
B000002U82|5.0|This album is a long beautiful poem... some of the lyrics are so beautiful and overwhelming (when combined with the mood of the music) that one's mind explodes... it's one of the most mind expanding pieces I know of... along  with Miles Davis who also sends my mind into the outer stratosphere....  &quot;and you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's  sinking&quot;... &quot;the lunatic is on the grass, the lunatic is in my  head&quot;... great spooky lyrics!
B000002L80|4.0|Definitely the not the best Talking Heads album, but also not the worst.  it has several great tunes (And She Was, Stay Up Late, Television Man), but it also has its share of mediocre tunes (Give me Back My Name, Perfect  World, Road to Nowhere).  Of course its good for die-hards but the casual  fans will probably be disappointed by its lack of dance qualities.  its  much more of a singing album than a dancing one like their previous  efforts.  it does have one of the best album backings ever though!!
B00000JPH5|5.0|This movie is so great!  I saw it when it first came on television and I loved it!  I've remembered it since then, which was probably 10 years ago, which would make me 8.  I love David Bowie as the Goblin King!  As a kid,  the hair and voice spooked me for a long time.
B000002AS3|2.0|I was living in England when it first came out and I thought it was pretty fun and catchy and fit in well with my surroundings. But the unimaginative beats, rote guitar solos and Liam's incessant whine started to grate after  the while. &quot;Slide Away&quot; is still an excellent tune, but the  rest...blah.
1559408758|5.0|Only one person rating this video didn't get it, so he gave it a one star.  This ought to tell you something.  This is one of the funniest satire films ever made.  Though it helps, it is not mandatory to have been in a  garage rock band in your life to understand the hilarious characters in  this flick.  This is Rob Reiner's finest film making moment.  He will never  duplicate this genius again.
B00000J7RZ|1.0|OK, so i liked the song &quot;if You had my love&quot; and i bought the album(very big mistake). really thats the only decent song on the album and its not even that good, so that should give you an idea. The lyrics are  silly and so is her voice. its really a bad album and that being gracious,  hopefully she won't attemp at another one but if you have not purchased it  yet don't. Its bad!

B00000K2UX|5.0|One of the all time great movies with music, cinematography (those fighter shots!), and love story tied together.  <br />One of Jerry Bruckheimer's orignial efforts, he combines the effors of Giorgio Moroder with several of  rock's greatest stars.  <br />Also, consider the star power of the movie and  the stars that came from this film.  Tom Cruise was sent on his way.  Meg  Ryan, her first big film. Tim Robbins, Anthony Edwards and Val Kilmer all  went on to great film careers.  <br />The mixture of the music, actors and  story works.<br />The new releases are a real bonus, Great Balls of Fire,  Sitting on the Dock of the Bay and who could forget Cruise's rendetion of  You Lost that  Lovin Feelin by the Righteous Brothers.  Thats right folks  it was not in the original soundtrack.<br />Too bad we had to wait this long.
0767824571|3.0|What a disappointment!  After seeing the fantastic job that was done putting The Meaning of Life on DVD, I was excited to see the Holy Grail receive the same treatment.  We all know how poor the film quality of the  Python films is and anyone who has seen TMoL knows how much better it looks  on DVD.  Not so with the Holy Grail, the video is no better at all, and the  sound may be better on VHS.  About the only thing better about the DVD is  the chapter search.  All in all I was very disappointed to say the least.   Of course this is just my opinion, I could be wrong.

B00001QEE9|5.0|Pinocchio, a timeless masterpiece, of daily standards that instill the young mind, that honesty, truthfulness, and bravery, along with love, brings happiness.
B00000ICD9|3.0|The Acting is Solid - The Special Effects truly inspiring, well done, tied together RIVALS Brazil for inspiration of effects! - The Story Line is Basic, but entertaining and possibly even thought provoking BUT the ending  is a MAJOR let down!  As soon as the movie ends - go to the special  features and select the alternative ending, it reflects a more solid  ending, an ending that goes with this movie - - - whoever made the changes  to the ending, must have done it for commercial reasons, and I consider  that to be a major sell-out!!  There is SO much ART in this film, that to  let the integrity of the original ending be changed for whatever reason, is  criminal.
0871137380|4.0|I was intrigued by the story after seeing an interview with Mark Bowden at a book conference. After finishing the book, i felt like i had been there right along with the soldiers and i couldn't help but feel the anger and  frustration that they felt.  Mr. Bowden told the story of these men in such  a compassionate, fair way that i would gladly look forward to anything else  he writes about the subject.  In fact, he should write about other  incidents in the military's history - he certainly has a way of giving us  civilians a glimpse into what these men went through.
B00000K2W1|5.0|Janis Joplin's &quot;greatest hits&quot; are comprised on this alblum, but a couple of not-so-famous songs are present such as &quot;Summertime,&quot;  which add a nice folky mood here.  Janis is the best female rock artist  ever born, and this c.d. is a great choice for any rock ,blues, or folk  fan!
0312932081|5.0|I highly recommend this book to readers - it is an engaging and gripping journey from start to finish.  This is one of those rare books that can be read over and over, each time with new insights, understanding and  feeling.<br />((If you are jaded or unimaginative - don't bother reading this  book as you will join the minority of unfortunate people who could not  connect with Ender or this story.))
B00000ADG2|5.0|I got this cd when it first came out, and I can't sing its praises enough.  Lauryn is a strong woman, not afraid to say what she believes, and you've got to respect that.  She borrows from old-school doo-wop, funk, and soul,  while taking the best of new-school production, talent, mixing it all into  an incredible cd.  I've gone through three copies... they keep getting  stolen, and I'm so addicted to Lauryn, I keep buying replacements.
B00000J7RZ|1.0|I'm sorry, Jennifer cant sing worth a darn. The only  reason why she has a record deal is because of who she is. I cant believe how bad she sings. I cant believe people are actually buying her album. I love Jennifer, and  love her as an actress, but she needs to put down the mic. I guess she has  been hanging around Puff Daddy to long,  because he thinks he can rap, and  she thinks she can sing.
B00001OH1S|4.0|Overall I'm very pleased. The songs are very evocative of the movie and even Sting's warbling is tolerable. A little too much 'mellow Jazz' by Bill Conti on the original score but I love the piano motif. Watch out for Nina  Simone's Sinnerman which is excellent. (Now how about releasing it in the  U.K. at an affordable price instead of having to pay a small fortune for an  'Import').
0790736101|5.0|Terence Fisher's Dracula is without doubt the most superior version of Stokers Gothic chiller ever to grace the screen. After the success of &quot;The Curse Of Frankenstein&quot; in 1957 Hammer decided to remake  Dracula and although it is debatable whether the Hammer Frankenstein is  better than the 1931 version Hammers Dracula is most certainly superior to  the Lugosi in almost every way. Christopher Lee makes his debut as the King  vampire oozing eroticism and fear and although his scenes are brief every  time is rivetting. Peter Cushing is also excellent as the enegetic Van  Helsing hell bent on destroying the Count at any cost. Wonderful sets by  Bernard Robinson and an the excellent three-note score by James Bernard is  now a classic piece of horror music. This is romantic horror, which is not  as scary as later adaptions but it still remains the closest to Bram  Stokers novelbringing out the underlying sexual overtones in the story that  were never touched before. The final scenes of Lee and Cushing physically  duelling in the castle are also classic horror scenes up there with  &quot;the Exorcist&quot; and others. This is British horror at its peak and  very best.
B000002BQK|5.0|Of course we get another fantastic album from Ms. Mariah Carey! The lyrics in her songs are very personal and creative, her voice is amazing. Every song on the album is amazing, my favs are, The beautiful ones, Outside,  butterfly, close my eyes, and breakdown. she is a true artist who writes  her own music and sings her own lyrics with this album you are sure to get  your moneys worth.  I was not a fan till a friend left her cd at my house  after one listen I had to run out and get my own copy! In a time when there  are so many horrible, no talent artists on the radio like (Jennifer Lopez,  Christine Aguelara and britney) heres an album with a real talented artist.  I love music and am very critical and i highly recommend this album, and i  heard &quot;heartbreaker&quot; her new single its also great and reminds me  of &quot;Dreamlover&quot;. so yes i think you should all buy this album!
0792151720|5.0|Well, it upsets me when someone says something as immature as &quot;I hated this movie!&quot; but there you go...but if you have at least one romantic bone in your body, you have to have some appreciation for this  incredible piece. Forget about the hype, forget about Leonardo Di Caprio  (he is good, but he is not, as a lot of yahoo Hollywood goers want to  believe, who carries the film) and for those of you who unfortunately saw  Cameron yell &quot; I am king of the world&quot; like a showoff at the  Academy Awards, try to forget that, too. Yes, what took place historically  with the Titanic was tragic, and who wants to make light of that? But what  better way to bring you to that time in history than a love story so  brilliantly carried by Kate Winslet, one of the better more true actresses  of our time and such incredible direction from many talented people. Even  my father, who HATES epic long films, was shocked at how much he enjoyed  watching it at least once. And I recently heard spooky author Stephen King  cried...so it can reach some favorite film until this once came along, but  I have to admit, if Kate had not been Rose, it would not have been near as  good. Tragic? Yes. But so was a film like &quot;Braveheart&quot; which I  found to be violence for violence sake. This movie being so popular sends a  message to Hollywood; more romance, more history, good actors. For those  who thought characters were not developed? Think about it, who has time on  a sinking ship? They did the best they could with what they had. Thank you.
B000002WMH|5.0|Bob Dylan said that hearing Elvis Presley for the first time felt like breaking out of jail...James Brown said that Elvis Presley taught white people how to get down...You will understand exactly what Bob and James  meant when you listen to this monumental box set. No other artist has  achieved such a perfect fusion of black and white music styles. Whether or  not Elvis Presley invented rock'n roll is a pointless intellectual debate  for, in the end, it is the sheer beauty of his work which matters. Whether  in the electrifying rockers or in the ballads which are filled with a  fragile sense of longing, he shows insanely perfect timing, phrasing, range  and, most of all, an emotional depth which can only be matched by the  greatest gospel or delta blues singers. This set makes it clear to me that  outside of Opera and Jazz, Elvis Presley was, quite simply, the greatest  singer who ever lived.
B00001OH1S|5.0|Most soundtrack today try to use the latest, trendiest artists. This soundtrack's compilation with Sting, Simone and others is unusual and exceptional! See the movie and get the soundtrack! Just as the movie was  for &quot;adults,&quot; the same goes for the music!
B00000K2SC|5.0|Watching this movie sent my mind reeling through a world of chaos and technology.  Grabbing hold and releasing only long enough to tighten its grip.  The definative cyberpunk movie of the ninties.  If you are a fan of  science fiction or just looking for an action movie, this is a must get.
0783114222|5.0|It's been a long time since I monopolised the tv set but this is worth it
0790733226|5.0|I'll concede up front that the fact that this is a major motion picture in the 1990's means that there is a ton of 'junk' in it.<br />Moving past that, the storyline is epic, the plot enigmatic and while some may bash the  unanswered questions, the reality is that this was not meant to resolve  issues but to explore them.
B000000W6R|5.0|This is the CD I listen to the most, and I have lots.  Sad, happy, angry, dreamy, and full of wonder.  So, so good.  The songs towards the end aren't so special but the first ten are phenomenal.  Soothe, Frail and Bedazzled,  and Whir are some of the sweetest, most perfect songs ever made.  Just buy  it, you'll see.
B000002AV5|5.0|If you are a Sade fan, I won't try to impress you with my thoughts. If you only know her hits from what you've heard around and like her, then you should by all means get this CD. If you have a lover over, try this: scald  some milk, pour into glasses, add Remy Martin Champagne Cognac and a good  glub of Kahlua (to your taste) ... after you've lit candles, put on this CD  and enjoy your toddies. If it doesn't make a magical evening, something  ain't right! And Sade will never sound the same to you again. Enjoy!
B000002KL3|5.0|This VH CD is the first where the band sounds like a band and not merely 3 guys backing up Eddie's pyrotechnics. That's not to say Eddie's fretwork isn't outstanding, it is but his playing really supports and fleshes out  the songs instead of the songs merely being showcases for his playing. I  don't think the band has ever rocked harder/better. From the opening roar  of &quot;...And the Will Rock&quot; to the closing 10 seconds of the album  that may have inspired the entire thrash metal genre, this CD comes on like  a sledghammer in heat. Every song has the band working as a tight unit,  particularly Fools and Romeo's Delight. VH proves they can still rock with  a sense of humor (Everybody Wants Some!, Take Your Whiskey Home). This  album is probably also the band's most varied without being downright weird  like Diver Down. Tora! Tora! Tora!/Loss of Control is a sonic freakout.  Could This Be Magic is VH's &quot;Bron 'Y' Aur Stomp&quot;, an acoustic  shuffle that is a nice counterpoint to the rest of the album's heaviness.  My only complaint is that the CD clocks in at a very brief 34 minutes.  C'mon Ed, how about a boxed set of complete remastered Roth-era  recordings!?
B000005S31|5.0|Where several Lou Reed albums are uneven and leave something to be desired (I happen to love 'em all, though), Coney Island Baby is magnificient from beginning to end.  Emotional compositions, superb delivery and strong, nimble, twangy guitar-work throughout, Lou delivers classic after classic.  Trying to pick out a single standout track is impossible.  Why this title hasn't been officially released in America (as of 05/2005) is something I'll never understand.<br /><br />This is possibly his most CONSISTENTLY IMPRESSIVE album of the 70's.
0679882820|5.0|My son loved this book as an infant and adores it as a toddler!  He learned Mr. Brown's sound's before he learned to talk.  An amazing book that draws children into the rhyme and rythm, and directly encourages them  to participate.  Every family with small children should own this book.
B000000WA2|1.0|Jeez, how can a record age so quickly? When it came out, I thought this was cool... now all I can say is that It's profoundly boring, repetitive, lame. I tried to sell my copy at a second-hand shop recently, the shop  assistant didn't want it because he had too many of them. Avoid unless  you're a diehard Blur fan.
B00000J7RZ|1.0|in a few words i will tell you, trust me don't do it! its really bad, and when I heard her sing I felt embarrased for her.  Shes an ok actress but singing is not her bag. the lyrics are bad, bad , bad. the songs are too.  sorry Jennifer, but people save the money its not worth it.
B000000W5N|5.0|This here is one of the best Rolling Stones albums out there. As much as I like Let It Bleed, this tops it. If you listen to Dead Flowers, Moonlight Mile, and my favrote Sister Morphine; you'll be hooked.
0671027344|5.0|This story was amzingly realistic and poignant. It was beautifully and intelligently worded. It received a great deal of criticism about the verbose nature of the teenagers conversations, but being a recent high  school graduate, I can say that my friends and I had the same ostentatious  vocabulary. The negative comments are unjustified. This book was great. It  ranks up there with my other favorites: Ordinary People, The Catcher in the  Rye, etc.
B000002UAX|5.0|If you want The Beatles in your library but only want one recording than this is it, because it has a little bit of everything: Soft ballads, hard &amp; heavy rock, goofy sing-a-longs, protests, ballads, pyschedlia, and  quite a bit more. The stunning variety makes each song really offset  the  others so that the whole album comes across as a weird transcendental  meditative trip. How's that for an allegory! [ ; ) If released now as a new  album it would have to be The Album of the Year, for who EVER really put  forth on one album this kind of music, and it not clash? No one. It is  without a doubt the best Beatles record, and debatably the best rock n roll  record yet produced. I truly feel sorry for those without enough vision to  appreciate this group and this album... you really are missing out.
6300268470|5.0|Well, Pilgrim, what else would you want? The Duke is outnumbered but he's hanging tough. Dean Martin's got the shakes (real stretch there) and Walter Brennen dispenses lovable guff. Ricky Nelson signs on. Angie Dickinson  pines for the Duke.<br />People shoot, sing and throw dynamite around.<br />All  of this builds up to The Big Showdown.<br />Pilgrim, if that's not enough, you  need to stay East River.
B000002UAU|5.0|This album has the amazing quality of being truly timeless. It clicks totally with the generations that grew up when it was released and with young people today. It is just as fresh and just as fun. The album has  serious messages in some songs, fun-loving romps in others, while it  occasionally dabbles in the weird. Those who give this album low reviews  are challenged to name all the sounds used on a mere 4-track recording  machine! Some punk kid below says this album imitates the Beach Boys...  huh? Paul admits this album was inspired by &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, but the  two are VERY different. I sincerly believe that no one can say they love  rock and roll and not have this in their collection.
B000002UE9|1.0|This is what's wrong with rock and roll.  I was a teenager when Poison stormed the scene.  I admit, I listened to them and even liked some of their material.  However, for some reason I never bought any of their  albums, instead, I just listened to my friend's copies.  Boy, I'm glad I  went that route.  There was a time that I was very hard and critical on the  '80's bands.  Now, with this huge emergence of the once popular  &quot;hair&quot; bands, I've come to appreciate them more in what they did  musically.  But for some reason, I still don't respect Poison.  Who feels  like hearing the same songs recorded over and over again.  Leave them  alone, they're stealing your money.
B000002UB3|5.0|There isn't a bad track on &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, not one! In midst of decaying as a band the group (and George Martin) pulled together one of the defining albums in all of rock music. It's not just a collection of songs  but ONE album, and removing any song from it to listen to solo just isn't  the same as hearing the whole thing in context. All the critics below me  who blast this album don't really have much to say on the solid power of  this album, and how it stands up today just as much as it did in '69. This  is what music could be if artists really tried. They showed us the way...
6304711891|5.0|From it's daring prison take over to it's inmense all out car chase throughout San Francisco,this movie will keep you at the edge of your soul,mind and body.
B000002UAF|5.0|I usually don't listen as much to the early Beatles stuff in my collection as I do the later psychedelia, but this album always makes me smile, tap my feet, and sing along! The movie is still a total blast after all these  years, and the soundtrack completly captures it's spirit. I wanted to write  a serious review of this album and critisize the songs I don't like, but I  can't; it's just too good! [ : )
B000002LQQ|5.0|Mark exhibits his musical superiority in this album.Especially songs like &quot;fade to black&quot;,&quot;you and your friend&quot;,&quot;iron hand&quot; and &quot;planet new orleance&quot; have some stunning guitar  works.It's easy, through album, to trace the roots of Dire Straits.They are  an amalgamation of Blues,folk and country and the this potion works like   magic. Hats off to Mark
B000002UAR|5.0|Alternative Rock today has all the cards in place to produce good music, they just fall short. The model they should follow is &quot;Revolver&quot;, which has it all. The songs' subject matter varies wildly from love to  drugs to anti-government to weird soundscapes. The muscianship is  excellent; the group plays like a BAND, together. While not as tight as  &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; or &quot;Abbey Road&quot;,  &quot;Revolver&quot; is  one album, one listening experience, whereas most albums today are just a  song collection. A must have, to be sure. [ : )
B00000J7J4|5.0|Like many, I bought the Supernatural CD becuase of the excellent collaberation of Santana and Rob Thomas.  Rob Thomas deserves a lot of credit and respect for bringing Carlos to the mainstream without making a  song that sounds like boy band pop.  They have crafted a unique sond the  solidifies Carlos' reputation as a legend and legitimizes Rob's songwriting  and performance skills.  The rest of the album makes it the best chart  topper in recent memory.
B000002UAO|4.0|Before &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, the Beatles were the quintessential bubble-gum pop band. This changes things. The songs on this album make it a major part of the folk rock canon, and it really does serve, as George  Harrison said, as a Disc 1 to &quot;Revolver&quot;'s Disc 2. I give it only  4 stars because it still has a dated sound to some songs, but that in NO  WAY diminishes it's artistry.
0783228317|5.0|Mother-of-sweating-Jesus! What does it all mean?  Does it even matter?  Like it or don't like it, your opinion has no worth to me at all.  This bit of film is without any doubt the best adaptation of a book I have ever  seen, almost a direct translation.  And the book it is based on is too well  done to be understood.  Somehow though, it all works itself into a five  star rating.  It makes about as much sense as this review, which I am  hoping is weird and confusing.  And your ax never did tell me where the  bathroom was....
B000002HIK|3.0|Very lukewarm in comparison to the RDJ Album which follows. It has its moments, but ... nothing spectacular. The Ventolin maxi-single is better.
0553213105|5.0|This is my favorite Austen book, beating out my second-favorite, Emma, by maybe half a mile! Every character is believable and human, and perhaps more importantly, can be understood by those of us of modern times.<br />Elizabeth is entirely lovable because she is NOT entirely perfect. She  has a penchant for mischief and irony that she has obviously inherited or  absorbed from her wonderfully eccentric and hilarious father, and a  slightly over-developed sense of her own worth that springs from her highly  and consciously intelligent observation of all the folks that share her  corner of the planet. But she is also wonderfully honest and capable of  eating crow when she sees the error of her assumptions.<br />Although this is  a beautiful glimpse into the ways and mores of a very different age, it is  also a timeless human drama, loaded with subtle humor.
B000002LCX|5.0|I consider this one of The Smiths most experimental cds.  This is particularly evident in the first couple tracks.  They are unlike anything else the group has ever released.  Morrissey does some wonderful things  with his voice in those two songs as well.  The rest of the cd is pure  brilliance.  Only The Smiths can release a cd where ever track is a winner.   Instead of going out with a bang the cd ends with a surprisingly soothing  number called &quot;I Won't Share You&quot;.  While I hate to have to rate  their cds, this is definately one of the top two in The Smiths collection  (the other being &quot;The Queen is Dead&quot;).
B0000039QA|5.0|A classic Lp!! Perhaps more so than his first offering 'Ready To Die'. True headz will love this album for it's diversity. More importantly we can all see Biggie's growth as an on this album.After semi-suicidal tones of  'Reday To Die'who would have ever thought we'd see him singing hooks on  cuts like &quot;Another&quot;,the errie &quot;You're Nobody(Till Somebody  Kills You)&quot;, or on the comical &quot;Playa Hater&quot;. The album's  legacy will ultimately be left by such hits as  &quot;Hypnotize&quot;,&quot;Mo Money, Mo Problems&quot;, &quot;Sky's the  Limit&quot;, and underground gems like &quot;Story to Tell&quot;,&quot;Kick  in the Door&quot;,F@#KING You Tonight&quot;, &quot;Notorious  Thugs&quot;,&quot;Going Back To Cali&quot;,and &quot;Ten Crack  Commandments&quot;.Add these facts with production by Puffy and the  Hitmen,Dj Premier, RZA, Dj Clark Kent,and Kay-Gee; ALONG with a  star-studded(but not exessive) guest list and you have a must-have for aLL  Hip Hop fans
0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mocking Bird is a great book.  It showed howAfro-Americans were treated unfairly in that time.  Tom was accused ofbeating and raping a girl but all the evidence was pointing away from him.  The book was good because it kept you on your toes, you never knew what would be next.
0060977493|3.0|Except for a fleeting reference to 'Ooshton Hauston Bergasson' the story lacks detail of the Maori migration to Dargaville and Kaitaia. Joe Hawke is referred to in a very  disrepectful way as a mongrel - which may or may not  be true.

0684867621|5.0|First, I'd like to submit that summer books needn't be long. Second, Stephen King novels don't need to make your skin crawl!!  In this short novel I found plenty of suspense, this is written from a child's  perspective and it brought me back to my childhood and some near misses  with &quot;getting lost&quot;.  Despite being a guy in his early 40's I  found myself relating very well to Trish'. As an adult I was hooked on the  depth of detail in this adventure (after all with a one character story you  better have background).  Now this isn't &quot;THE STAND&quot; or &quot;THE  SHINING&quot; and I don't think it should be compared to them. It was a  nice summer read!!!
0790733226|4.0|In some ways, this adaptation of Carl Sagen's novel does not work. There is very little chemistry between Foster and McConaughey (a relationship totally changed from the book), and the ending could have been better  scripted.<br />But I like this movie in spite of its shortcomings. It is a  rare combination of an interesting plot line and great special effects.  Jodie Foster gives a good performance. <br />But if you're on the fence about  buying this DVD, consider that it has great commentary tracks (by Foster,  Zemekis, et all) and some fascinating behind the scenes explanations of how  the special effects were constructed. One of the best packaged DVDs for the  money.<br />As a movie, this is good, not exceptional. As a DVD, it is a  worthy addition to your collection.
0451197879|4.0|A good read!!! Although this Bachman novel doesn't explain itself very well, I can't help but think that King has hit the nail on the head about '90's America (despite the time in which he wrote it).  Anyone frustrated  at their job or ticked off at authority knows this feeling all too well.   Fortunately most people only read books like this instead of taking the  kind of action in it.
B000002C1X|5.0|Pink Floyd, the most overrated British band of all times, has only one good recording: it is &quot;The Wall&quot;. But, in this one, they almost reached perfection. It's a journey to the senses. Forget that this is Pink  Floyd and listen to it.
0451160916|5.0|I recently picked up a copy of this book, not having read it since it first came out and with the movie and the TV movie blurring my memory I had to reread it!  Good Idea!!!  This story is a great mix of the 'haunting of  the mind' as well as the 'haunted hotel'.  If you haven't seen either of  the movies, you should read it first.  The Tv version (by King) is of  course truer to the book, but something always seems lost in A Stephen King  novel put to the screen, (I won't even mention how many film renditions of  his work are such a waste!)  Even if you've read this book it's worth a  reread!!!!
B000002H97|3.0|This CD received too much poublicity, I don't know why. It really marked the beginning of MEtallica's change of sound (to worst), The only reason it really sold so good was because they smartly passe many years without  releasing a studio album, and this one was greatly expected. Ah, I'll be  damned if the guy who signed &quot;James Hetefield&quot; below is really  Hetfield. He wouldn't write so lousy!
0792839730|5.0|Quite simply the best war movie ever.  It was the 'Saving Private Ryan' of its time, although not nearly as gory.  However, it showed the invasion of Holland without any fictional dramatization.  It is also the most  impressive cast that I have ever seen in a movie.  Get it.  You'll be glad  you did.
B000002H33|5.0|The guys from Metallica should look at these reviews and compare them with the reviews to Load and &quot;reload&quot;, to realize what fans really expect from them, independently from what album sales can tell them. THis  is metal, pure and well written, fast-paced, melodic, agressive, good  lyrics, everything that made Metallica famous.
0792151712|5.0|I always find it funny how people bat such a critical eye to Titanic's love story, because in my mind, it's really no worse than the romantic/harlequin fluff that was popular before Easy Rider changed the  game.<BR><BR> Rather, I simply marveled at James Cameron's filmmaking  because in the space of 3.5 hours, he in a sense encapsulated the  experience of the Titanic and really America at the time.<BR><BR> Ignore  the love story and marvel at the stunning detail of this Titanic.  Look  behind those lovers and see the sometimes nasty division of the working  class and bourgeosie, those slaving in the  steam engines, those partying  below the decks, and the upper crust discussing their property in the East  Coast.  I don't want to overrate the movie, but Titanic is really one of  the slyest pieces of class commentary I've ever seen.<BR><BR> Then, notice  how the camera swoons over these two people, capturing those feelings as  one might imagine being two teens on the grandest boat of all must feel  like.  Sure, the love story itself is standard stock stuff.  But, let me  ask you -- were the so-called Hollywood classics any more original?  The  trick with those movies and with this one is that a Hollywood love story is  about the swoon, the pageantry of emotions, the romance of circumstances,  and all that other good stuff.  With such a powerful subject as the  Titanic, Cameron trumps it up in a fashion befitting the golden age of  Hollywood.<BR><BR> Which sets up the tragic climax, and Cameron never  flinches at depicting the moments of horror and dignity that must have  been.  By deftly switching between personal and vast scenes of people  facing death, we are constantly in touch of the scope of this tragedy.  You  couldn't do this without setting up a convincing love story, and that's  what Cameron did for 2 hours.<BR><BR> Is it the greatest love story of all  time?  Of course not.  But, it's easily one of the best large-scale  Hollywood romances of all time, whichif you realize by now isn't about  love at all, but the circumstances around it.
B000002U82|1.0|I think that, nowadays, it's a sign of a person being a cultured one, to say that &quot;Dark Side&quot; is a &quot;master-piece&quot;, &quot;highly intelligent&quot;, or whatever. I don't think so, I bought the albun and  changed it for another albun in the store, only two days after buying it.  WHy? BEucause I heard &quot;The Wall&quot; and said to myself: &quot;Uau,  this is great!!&quot; So I thought: well, this &quot;Dark Side&quot; is one  of the best selling recordings of all times (more than 23 million copies  sold, until 1997). But I was disappointed. THis CD has a lot of nonsense,  and it seems the musicians are making a fool of the listeners.
6300181553|5.0|This is indeed a charming film and a favorite. It's especially funny to see Fred Astaire as a cad, apparently enjoying playing his likeable but rather disreputable character.  Not to be overlooked is the extraordinary  unself-conscious racism. From the stereotyped black maid to the  disrespectful treatment accorded the maid's children, the racist portrayals  are striking. The 'Lincoln's Birthday' number, in which Bing Crosby and  Marjorie Reynolds appear as 'blackface' caricatures, is beyond belief by  today's---or indeed any---standards. And yet this movie was not made by  Klansmen, but by 'nice', ordinary Americans.  In a final irony, Crosby  appears later in the film (made in the early days of the Second World War)  as the 'Freedom Man', wearing an Uncle Sam-style top hat. All without irony  or shame. For those who doubt the deep-seated nature of racism in America,  watch and perhaps enjoy this film---and learn.
0060920084|5.0|Brutal humour. I have read it three times and still laugh out loud. It appears this book has hit a raw nerve in some of my more sensitive fellow Americans, but if we can't laugh at ourselves what fun is there? Relax,it's  the American way.<br />God Bless Bill Bryson
