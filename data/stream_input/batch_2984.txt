B001NIA27E|4.0|I've always really liked this movie and had it on VHS.  Now I wanted a DVD copy.  I find going from VHS to DVD is like seeing a whole new movie since the definition is so much better.  This movie gives you a lot of action.  It's a little corny in spots but that doesn't stop me from watching it over and over again.  Pierce Brosnan is very good in this movie.

B00D2PLWG6|5.0|I'm a Placebo fan since 2005, for me Meds and Sleeping With Ghosts are beyond perfection! The best Musical Albums someone could eve made, however after Battle for the Sun I got a little bit disappointed because they changed their musical style, but being loyal to my favorite band I bought this Deluxe Box a little bit scared and when I saw all it has I was amazed, and then when playing the album for the very first time I felt in love automatically.<br /><br />The Alternative Video Album was a great idea, I love every single video it has, and you have a video for each song. For me this is their come back after Battle For The Sun and everyone at work got jealous to see all the good material this bundle has!!

B00DONJXGM|5.0|We live in Düsseldorf, Germany, and when we heard about this concert in February, 2013, we immediately bought tickets. 2nd row from the stage, on the aisle.<br /><br />Neither of us had ever seen Joe Cocker live, though we'd long admired his interpretations and his intenstity and passion when he sings. So, this seemed like a once-in-a-lifetime event not to be missed.<br /><br />And it was all of that and more.<br /><br />Not only was Joe Cocker head-on into the music, and hitting every note with such intenstity, but, the band was doing the same thing. I expect that he would expect no less from them. They were incredible, and obviously having a lot of fun at the same time, which always makes for a great time for the audience. Us. And, apparently, everybody else, all 14,000 of us.<br /><br />And there were cameras all over the place. One on a big boom right in front of us, the spiderman-cam floating all over the auditorium all night, and lots of other cameras, hand-held, and otherwise, which, in total captured all of the best of this extraordinary performance. Kudos to the production crew!<br /><br />Yes, we were there, and have seen this DVD twice, now, since then.<br /><br />It is a moment of musical history.<br /><br />Joe said he would be back to Cologne, as he left the stage, and maybe he will be.<br /><br />But, I'm just glad that we saw him on that magical night, on a Monday, in April, in Cologne, Germany.<br /><br />And that an excellent production company filmed that, so, we'll always have it.<br /><br />Superb! Enjoy!

At times I think the message of the book gets repeated a bit too often, but then he's preaching to the choir as long ago I decided that having a J-O-B was not for me.<br /><br />His advice concerning the Simple Practice is pure gold. Making it a priority to take care of own physical, emotional, and spiritual health-- connecting to kindness toward yourself and others is a powerful way to be connected to your core and power. American society teaches us we should wear out ourselves out and then keep going with the the lifetime support from mood meds and other prescription drugs.

B00BGI08GG|5.0|See the full review at Metal Arcade .Net<br /><br />Green Arrow has long played second fiddle to DC's most lucrative dark, brooding hero, Batman. Comparisons have often been made between the two characters, and it's easy to see why - they're both billionaires that decide to take the law into their own hands, utilizing a host of advanced gadgets and prowling the city rooftops for criminal scum. CW's hit show Arrow aims to modernize the character and carve out its own identity, and it largely succeeds. I could absolutely see Stephen Amell's hooded vigilante fighting alongside Supes and the Caped Crusader in a Justice League film.<br /><br />Arrow tells the tale of Oliver Queen, a rich playboy who survives five years as a castaway on a secluded island after his father's boat the Queen's Gambit is shipwrecked. Oliver is the sole survivor, with his father having taken his own life to save him and Sara Lance, the sister of his girlfriend Laurel, having drowned. Fast forward to the present day, and Oliver is reunited with his family, including his mother Moira, his sister Thea, and his best friend Tommy Merlyn. He's hesitant to talk about the trials he suffered through on the island, and these events are brilliantly revealed to us in a series of flashbacks throughout the season.<br /><br />Oliver Queen tasks himself with righting the wrongs of his father and his associates, who have brought his home city of Starling City to ruins. By day Oliver plays the part of the irresponsible heir to the Queen fortune, and by night he takes on the role of The Vigilante, a hooded figure who is targeting the corrupt one-percenters and scumbags of his city. His mother assigns a bodyguard to watch over him, an ex-soldier named John Diggle who later joins his crusade against villainy. Oliver knows that his father hid some dark secrets from him, and it turns out his mother isn't quite the angel he thought she was as well...<br /><br />Arrow is obviously heavily inspired by the Christopher Nolan Dark Knight trilogy, and attempts to keep its characters and storylines as grounded as possible. The show manages to strike a great balance between action and drama, and though it can feel a bit soapy at times with its love triangles and the like, the acting and writing really make you care about these characters. It helps that every one of its 23 episodes feature incredible fight choreography, sharp dialogue and very solid acting. Lead actor Stephen Amell imbues Oliver Queen with heart, and manages to portray the dual identities of the emotionally damaged billionaire and the bow-wielding badass The Hood with ease.<br /><br />The supporting cast is also great, and the writers masterfully interweave the events of the island with present-day storylines. The entire season has a great build, leading up to an epic, emotional finale. There are hardly any lulls or filler here, and even with 23 one-hour episodes I had to force myself to take breaks in my binge-watching - it's that engaging. For a season that's literally twice as long as some other show's seasons, that's really saying something. The show constantly introduces new characters that quickly grow on you, including the awesome Deathstroke (Spartacus' Manu Bennett), Diggle, Yao Fei and the Dark Archer.<br /><br />The Blu-ray set comes with four Blu-ray disks and five DVDs, as well as a code to unlock the entire first season through Ultraviolet. As far as special features, there's a decent enough set here - deleted scenes are included with most of the episodes (it's hilarious watching these with no sound effects), there's a few documentaries, and a gag reel. Arrow Comes Alive! talks about the process of modernizing the Green Arrow character for a TV series, while staying true to its comic roots. Arrow: Fight School/ Stunt School takes a look at the expertly choreographed action sequences, and how the shots are roughed out by the stunt men and made safe for the actors to perform. Arrow At Paley Fest 2013 is a bitlike a Comic-Con panel, featuring the writers, directors, and the lead actors. Nothing overly amazing, but Arrow is spectacular enough to warrant a purchase even with no extras at all.like a Comic-Con panel, featuring the writers, directors, and the lead actors.

B00B52FDXQ|5.0|See the full review at Metal Arcade .Net<br /><br />STARZ' Spartacus tells the tale of a Thracian gladiator who led his fellow slaves in an uprising from 73 to 71 BC. After the fall of Roman commander Gaius Claudius Glaber in Spartacus: Vengeance, the rebels have amassed victory after victory and struck fear in the hearts of their former masters. The legend of Spartacus has begun to spread throughout the land, causing thousands of slaves to take up arms for his cause. Roman General Marcus Crassus joins forces with Julius Caesar to take down the Bringer of Rain once and for all - and he proves to be the only man able to match the Thracian in both swordsmanship and intellect. Now Spartacus: War of the Damned has finally arrived on Blu-ray, and its ten fantastic final episodes are rounded out by a host of great features.<br /><br />Spartacus: War of the Damned is an incredible final season, where every episode is stronger than the last, building towards an epic, emotional finale. Liam McIntyre continues in the role of Spartacus from Season 2, and the cast also features Manu Bennett (Crixus), Dustin Clare (Gannicus), Dan Feuerriegel (Agron), Simon Merrells (Crassus), Todd Lasance (Caesar) and Cynthia Addai-Robinson as Naevia.<br /><br />The picture and sound quality are quite good here. The widescreen 1.78:1 1080p image looks sharp and vivid without being oversaturated. The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless audio track is phenomenal, with clear dialogue, a bombastic soundtrack and explosive sound effects that fill out the sound field -  it's sure to give your home theater system a workout.<br /><br />As for  the special features, there are six featurettes and Blu-ray exclusive audio commentaries, as well as extended episodes. Spartacus: The Legend Retold is essentially a primer that I'm assuming was aired prior to the season's airing on STARZ. It tells the origins of the Spartacus show, the cast talks about their favorite moments from the series thus far, and also a bit about the transition from the Andy Whitfield era to Liam McIntyre's take on the role. It also goes into the six-episode prequel series Gods Of The Arena, where Dustin Clare's Gannicus took center stage to give Whitfield time off. The Price Of Being A Gladiator is a short chat with some of the cast, as they talk about how physically difficult the Spartacus boot camp is that prepares them for their roles, and how it helps them bond as a group and toughen up for their on-screen battles. They also share some insight into the multitude of injuries that they sustained while filming, from black eyes to broken ribs.<br /><br />A Bloody Farewell sees the cast lamenting the end of the show, and looking back fondly on their great times spent together. The Spoils of War: Revealed goes into the visual effects and how the CGI works to elevate the show visually, beyond what would be normally possible on a stage set. Adorning The Damned sheds light on the intricate costume designs that are created for the show, and shows off some of the incredible details in the outfits that fans may have missed. The Mind Behind Spartacus is a bit of an interview with showrunner and creator  Stephen S. DeNight, talking about his ideas, new characters and storyline concepts for the final season, as well as some of his favorite moments.<br /><br />As with past Spartacus releases, the package is enclosed in a plastic outer sleeve, and when it is removed, the three-disk collection opens up like a book. The inside is adorned with promotional images of the cast, and the front cover features a menacing photo of Liam McIntyre as Spartacus, with raised lettering. The ten episodes included have a total runtime of 562 minutes, and the video is not rated.<br /><br />Very few shows have consistently entertained and engaged me like Spartacus has. The series has consistently, over three seasons and a prequel series, defied expectations and delivered one of the most action-packed, well-acted historical dramas ever to grace the small screen. It's even survived the unfortunate passing of the original lead actor, the late Andy Whitfield. With many great shows having been canceled before their time, I'm glad to see that Spartacus was able to end on its own terms. The Spartacus: War of the Damned Blu-ray is a stellar presentation and package for a mesmerizing, very deserving show, and all fans of the series will definitely want to pick it up.ce the small screen.

B00C7607BC|5.0|Full review at Metal Arcade .Net<br /><br />Originally released on November 14th, 1989, The Little Mermaid has since gained legendary status in the pantheon of great Disney animated films. Based on the Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale (which is much darker than Disney's take), the film tells the tale of Ariel, daughter of King Triton, lord of the seas. Ariel is a rebellious girl, fascinated by the humans that live on land above her. She collects trinkets from the outside world, and becomes infatuated with a prince named Eric when she saves him from a brutal storm at sea. Against her father's wishes, and while dragging along her friends Flounder and Sebastian, she seeks out the devilish sea witch Ursula - who promises to give her a human form. The catch? Ursula wants her voice, and Ariel will have three days to make the prince fall in love with her - or else she'll return to her mermaid form and her soul will belong to the sea witch.<br /><br />Filmmakers Ron Clements and John Musker were under a lot of pressure to deliver a good film with The Little Mermaid, as it was one of the most expensive productions Disney had undertaken in the pre-computer graphics days. Luckily, a solid script, captivating songs written by Alan Menken, and brilliant artwork came together to create a cinematic masterpiece for the ages. Of course, the film went on to win stellar reviews, earned several Oscars and Golden Globes, and ended up taking in over $200 million in box office.<br /><br />There's no denying that The Little Mermaid looks gorgeous on Blu-ray - this is overall a great 1080p AVC HD transfer - but the film is beginning to show its age a bit. I remembered it looking better than it actually does - while there are plenty of beautiful, colorful shots under the sea and in Eric's kingdom, there's definitely a softness to the picture. It's the last of Disney's films to use actually hand-painted animation cels - save for a few shots where the pioneering CAPS digital coloring system was utilized - so this is likely why it looks a bit more dated than it is. The film was only a few years behind Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King, yet those films look superior on Blu-ray.<br /><br />The actual hand-drawn animation looks great, and it's obvious the lengths that Disney's animators went to to properly emulate human emotion and movement - one of the extras goes into detail about all of the live action footage that was shot for reference. But there's also plenty of animation that looks a bit choppy or perhaps unrefined, as if the film was under a time crunch. There's also a few changes made from the 2006 edition - while the colors and contrast appear to be boosted to make the image pop more, there are a few alterations in colors in some scenes, and also a few issues in the remaster, such as a random bar that appears for a split second in the climactic sea battle. Overall though, the presentation is definitely a step up from the 2006 edition.<br /><br />The sound mix is definitely decent, once again considering its age. The 7.1 DTS HD soundtrack comes alive during the major songs and setpieces, namely the bombastic \\"Under The Sea\\". That said, some of the mix feels a bit uneven - dialogue seems constrained to the center channel, while music and effects are panned all over the stereo field. The soundtrack does make an impact at times though, such as in the storm at sea where Ariel saves Eric and the final battle against Ursula.<br /><br />Disney has managed to cram all of the original extras from the 2006 Platinum Edition DVD onto this Diamond Edition Blu-ray, plus a host of all-new features. Here's a list of the new stuff:<br /><br />\\"Part of Your World\\" Music Video Featuring Carly Rae Jepsen (HD, 3:39). You probably know this girl from that \\"Call Me Maybe\\" song that took over the world for a short while. This is her new version of the classic track sang by Jodi Benson, but she can't really hold a candle to the original. Still, her voice isn't bad by any means.<br />@DisneyAnimation (HD, 10:45). This is a really cool look inside the animation studio at Disney, and has a few interviews with artists there that were inspired by seeing The Little Mermaid when they were young. A few of the older guys who actually made the film are here too, and shed some light on some interesting facts about the creation of this classic.<br />Deleted Character - Harold the Merman (HD, 2:05) Ron Clements and John Musker talk about and show rough animation for a bespectacled, nerdy character that was ultimately removed from the final film. He had quite a minor role in the first place.<br />Under The Scene: The Art of Live-Action Reference (HD, 13:13). This is pretty interesting. I knew that animators and artists utilize reference material, but apparently in a number of Disney films live actors were hired to essentially act out the entire movie, which was then studied and recreated in animation for a true-to-life look. There's some funny footage here, such as the actor who played Eric rowing in a serious scene while on an office chair with oars, and the girl who played Ariel diving in a giant freezing tank so that the filmmakers could capture what hair looks like underwater. Also shows some live action footage from Alice In Wonderland and Sleeping Beauty.<br />Howard's Lecture (HD/SD, 16:27) A lecture by Howard Ashman, who was the lyricist for `The Little Mermaid'.<br />Part of Her World: Jodi Benson's Voyage to New Fantasyland (HD, 4:45). Actress Jodi Benson, who played Ariel, taks a trip with her children to the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World to check out New Fantasyland.<br />Crab-E-Oke Sing-Along (HD, 15:35). Songs include \\"Part of Your World\\", \\"Under the Sea\\", \\"Poor Unfortunate Souls\\", \\"Les Poissons\\", and \\"Kiss the Girl\\".<br /><br />Overall, this is another great release from Disney, and a solid package for those anticipating The Little Mermaid`s hi-def release on Blu-ray. The picture and sound are about as clean as they're ever going to get, and fans of the film get a whole hour of brand-new features on top of all of the existing DVD extras on the disk.'t bad by any means.<br />@DisneyAnimation (HD, 10:45).

The novel was a short read, though having written my own novel, even the shortest of reads requires the greatest of lengths during the creation.<br /><br />I hadn't heard of it before, but picked it up on the strength of everything else in his catalog that I've enjoyed over the years. Without revealing ANYTHING about the content, the last ten pages or so were so bittersweet, sentimental, and so rife with unfulfilled expectations and unexpected sadness that I just had to say something.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good, honest, memorable read, walk down to the end of the lane, and tell me what you think about the childhood that you may have forgotten.

B000005YZM|5.0|This is my first Zombies album and it is OUTSTANDING. The album was received indifferently on release in 1967, but has since become critically acclaimed. It ranked number 100 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. My very favorite song is &#34;CARE OF CELL 44&#34;.  What a delightful, beautiful, thoughtful song.<br /><br />&#34;CARE OF CELL 44&#34; is &#34;breezy, infectious pop melody&#34; with &#34;choral harmony breaks,&#34; and particularly praises Chris White's &#34;melodic&#34; bass playing. He also remarks that the song shows its Brian Wilson and Paul McCartney influences but remains original. Matt Kivel claims that &#34;in three minutes and fifty three seconds The Zombies have slyly redefined the lyrical conventions of a modern pop song.&#34; Music critic Antonio Mendez called it one of the sublime songs on Odessey and Oracle.<br /><br />Wonderful experience. Do yourself a favor and get this fabulous 40th Anniversary edition. All of the songs in Stereo, in Mono, and a fantastic backing track for &#34;Care of Cell 44&#34; -- really awesome.

B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I loved this film as a child, and first saw it when I was about 6 or 7. It's not a musical, it's much darker than the Judy Garland film, it has some great performances and is beautifully filmed. It's quite scary, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. Stories for kids have often been pretty frightening; just look at the old Grimm fairy tales. Not for the pre-schoolers, who may already be familiar with the musical, but give them a few years and their tastes may just crave the darker side of fantasy adventure.
B005544V6A|5.0|Started watching Suits this season by accident!  Watched the entire 3rd season and went back to find out the history behind the dynamic duo in Season 1 !<br />Love the relationship between Harvey & Mike (especially the throw back banter). Seeing a strong woman at the helm and an amazing assistant named Donna!<br />True to life, when someone sees you have potential, sometimes breaking the rules / taking them under your wing can be rewarding!<br />Thanks Amazon for the opportunity to catch up on one of my favorite shows!
0307730700|5.0|Before making the decision to order this book or not I spoke with a  Christian man who had already read it. He could say nothing but good things about it and as a matter of fact, he recommended it to me. So I went with it and have not been sorry.<br /><br />This is a true story.<br /><br />This is a book written about a man named, \\"Adam Brown\\" who, out of an attempt to steer clear of his addictions, chose instead to fight the challenge to become a Navy Seal.<br /><br />I am truthfully NOT into things about the military but have an interest in those who have overcome their addictions with the help of our Lord and God. This is one such story.<br /><br />I totally recommend this book!<br /><br />TO GOD BE THE GLORY!<br /><br />I received this book for free in exchange for a free book review from the WaterBrook Press publishers through the [...] book review program. I was not required to write a favorable review.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved the book all the way up the closing chapters. The gruesome unnecessary killings were in bad taste. I truly hope they change the ending in the movie. This could possible be one of those very rare cases where the movie is better than the book. :-(
B00F36ZHHC|1.0|I took it off right away after I downloaded it. It simply did not work. I would not recommend this.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I got this mostly for traveling. I normally use my iPad to hook up to hotel televisions to watch stuff I bring with me or stream. But that's usually kind of inconvenient when you're searching for things to watch and don't really want to get out of bed. This was just finally getting in stock and the price was perfect, so I thought I would check it out!<br /><br />But, unfortunately if you're looking to use it in a hotel, you'll have no luck 8 times out of 10 because you are using the hotels wifi network. Which doesn't really play well with letting different devices connect to one another, for obvious reasons. If your hotel provided a wired connection you could always bring a router and create your own wifi network in the room. But that's getting a little in depth. I have heard of people using their computers as the routers while using the hotel's wifi. Again, sounded like a bit over my head.<br /><br />So since I couldn't use it for that, I figured I would hook it up to my guest room tv. And I have to say, it's pretty awesome! Right now there are only 3 apps for it, Netflix, Youtube, and Android Play. As of this writing the there is a develop program going which will bring many more apps in the near future. It will basically become a pocket Roku device.<br /><br />It's easy to setup and pretty much anyone on your network has access to it. So if you have a friend over and they want to show you something on youtube, they can just stream it using their phone. That's awesome! And the Netflix app is pretty good too! It's kind of crazy when you are using your phone as video streaming device for your 50&#34; TV and it looks great.<br /><br />Also another cool feature was the Chrome browser extension. It basically turns your browser into an airplay like device. Whatever you are looking at is reflected on the TV. I can imagine this being really handy for presentations or even a fantasy football draft.<br /><br />The build quality is solid. It doesn't feel like plastic and actually has some weight to it. It also has a external power adapter if you're using a TV that doesn't have HDMI 1.4 (I guess 1.4 lets you power devices and I think you will mostly only find it on 2013 TV's)<br /><br />So even though I couldn't use it for the reason I bought it, I still really like it. And at $35 it's cheap enough to pick up an check out, if only to use as a Netflix device. And once the 3rd party apps come out of beta, I think this thing will be huge. There are rumors that you will eventually be able to play content directly from your phone. That would solve my hotel network issue!<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this product.  I would have given it 5 stars if they already had the option to do something like Wifi Direct, where you just beam from your phone directly to the Chromecast without a network. There are rumors of that coming through updates too! But even if the rumors don't come true, I'm pretty sure Hulu is coming and maybe even Amazon Prime!
B00633W614|5.0|A most interesting presentation.  The characters are fascinating and the plot is great.  Can't wait to see what happens in the next segment.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|It's a fun adaptation of Austen's novel, and the acting is very good. After watching it several times on Ovation, I decided to purchase a copy.
0061148512|5.0|Such an amazing and haunting American classic, a must read. The perfect accompaniment to Kerouac, Sexton, Burroughs, and Bukowski in the annals of pre-1960s lit

0812982622|5.0|I'm always leery of reading an incredibly popular book because on the one hand if I like it, then I'm just going with the flow and liking what everyone else likes, but on the other hand if I don't like it then I try to figure out what's wrong with me. After hearing all the hype about this book I was skeptical it could live up to expectations but boy howdy did it ever. It's a completely engrossing story that hooks you early and doesn't let go. What I love the most is the self-discovery Johnson allows the reader. He drops clues about the characters and the culture that you pick up on and say to yourself \\"I get it now. I see why he feels that way\\" later on. If there's anything to criticize it's the timeline. The second half of the book jumps through time a lot and sometimes it's not easy to keep straight which timeframe we're in. I even think there was a flashback within a flashback within a flashback once. But that's a small inconvenience on an otherwise brilliant story. Most definitely one of the best books I've ever read.
1401937519|5.0|Anita reminds us that we are all part of the Whole which is love.  Therefore if we genuinely live as love the world will be transformed just through our being...it's not difficult, in fact, it's beautifully simple if surrender to love.
B009ZQJ1G4|2.0|Slow moving storyline .  Plot is fresh definitely no match to the matrix series !  2 stars at best !
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I love this book and the entire series. I think I read all of them in 2 weeks. Extremely addicting!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I never wanted this book to end......<br />For days I couldn't put it down. It transports you back in time and you're griped by it\\"s power. This author has done her research. I loved it.
0425263924|5.0|The characters kept evolving and the storyline remained interesting.  I'm sure I will read this stimulating series more than once.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Love this game! So entertaining and gets my brain going. This and a cup of coffee and I am ready for a puzzler of a day!
0425263916|5.0|By now I am liking this series just as much as 50 Shades.  It has a great story line that kept me interested.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Great after downloading the app the photos went from my phone to my kindle. Now everytime I take a picture it automaticly goes on my phone and directly to my kindle. Its gerat I love it.
0425263908|5.0|I had trouble at first with the all too obvious similarities to 50 Shades.  But then I got into the characters more and really ended up liking the book.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|My grandson said this was a great book and also my granddaughter said the same thing.  She is 22 years old and he is 12 and that is great that two people at different ages can enjoy the same book

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|It's the best show I've seen in a series. I'm glad in watching it now in bulk rather than waiting for the week to pass to see the next episode
B00594XOZU|2.0|This app used to work PERFECTLY and I loved but but now when I try to log in it takes forever then it says &quot;error. This is taking longer than it should, try again in a bit&quot; PLEASE FIX THIS
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|Very thought-provoking, as Gladwell usually is.  I can't say it's my favorite of his books...I still prefer Blink and The Tipping Point, but I still enjoyed it.
0812550706|5.0|Great! I received the book , now my daughter can begin her reading and school book report. I didn't know how popular this book was, and I am impressed by the quality of the book.
B004LM72ZY|5.0|Here is what I love about this.  It is VERY durable.  It is easy to get the lid off and on. I was concerned it would be too babyish for my 5 year old son, but he loves it.  He can even toss it in the air and it is so solid it is not going to break.
6304712936|5.0|This has always been a favourite of mine.  Thanks!<br />The producer had taken certain liberties.  Nevertheless we forgive him!!  Hope he'll do better next time!

1400034205|5.0|I have read this book before - and will read it again.  Somerset Maughan's words give vivid pictures of life of those times. One of the characters spends many years travelling - to try to find 'the meaning of life' and has influence over all who come into contact with him. All the characters become quite likeable, for different reasons. This book is just a wonderful read!
B008200LHW|5.0|For those with a bricked Parrot Smart Asteriod should purchase this. 100% functional with Parrot Smart Asteriod who seems to ship their crappy USB GPS module that died within 2 weeks of installation. Shame on Parrot.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|The story moved well and I found myself rooting for the main characters, but the book read more like the movie script that it turned out to be. Certainly not a deep or thought provoking work of fiction, but it was adequate to pass the time on a long trip.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The whole family loves this game. My only complaint is that the in purchase options are e expensive and annoying. Other than that, it's a great way to pass time!
B00FGM0JTY|5.0|As of today, we can't buy this DVD - it did play in our local arthouse movie theater and our cable TV system is showing it now, for an extra few dollars. I grew up in Alabama and was bitten by the R & B bug at age 8.  I've loved it, lived it, played it all my life (I'm now a 65-yr-old caucasian lady).  Yes, people in our little town thought my brother and I were crazy, so much did we love this music.  I'm thankful that this film was made, and it must have been years in the making, because here you see Wilson Pickett and Jerry Wexler, both of whom have been dead for several years now.<br /><br /> I never knew the story was so rough.  Never knew that Rick Hall had such a rough life.  We picked up bits and pieces about Muscle Shoals as we grew up -- it became like a magic, mystical place in our minds. It would be wonderful if the whole cut of each song could be played, but that would make the movie way too long. The photography is beautiful, the remarks made by Wilson Pickett, Percy Sledge, Aretha Franklin, Clarence Carter, Jerry Wexler, Keith Richard and Mick Jagger, and more,  make you slowly realize that Muscle Shoals was almost a miracle.  The first hit, the wonderful \\"You Better Move On\\" by Arthur Alexander - followed by the Rolling Stones playing and singing the same song, makes you gasp.  Tears flowed, I don't mind saying.  Just put aside whatever you may think about Alabama, and see this movie.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Nothing goes better  together than thunderstorms and a great Stephen king book add a cup of tea some quiet time and your all set. Thank-you again!!
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Loved every minute of it .  Wished it was longer.  I am an animal lover and therefore have read many animal stories but this one really touched my heart.
B008742O32|5.0|exactly what i was looking for and it works!! i am not too sure if someone steals my phone and remove the app if i would still be able to track it.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Entertaining which is what I was looking for. Interesting characters although I was able to predict the ending. Still enjoyed it.
B00BKTFABE|4.0|I like it, but when I try to record a video, it starts blinking and it distracts me. The app is okay, but the only problem I had with it was that.
0312370849|4.0|I found the book very interesting and informative.  The ending got a little &#34;busy&#34;.<br />The book came quickly and in great condition.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I didn't think that these books were going to be any good. But Rick Riordan does a great job in adding to the story line. The new characters are great.
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|Horrible soundtrack on the Blu-ray.  Heavy static makes it impossible to hear the dialogue, which is often whispered.<br />Malick is a great director, and this film is experimental - so I had to check the DVD in the set to make sure that the static wasn't intended. I didn't watch this until the return window had expired, or would have sent it back.
6304712499|5.0|I really loved the movie and it can be considered as one of technologically inclined movie during those days. Hope the remaking of this movie is real.
B00594XOZU|2.0|I used kik for awhile on my kindle fire HD then all of a sudden I can't log in or make a new account it takes a long time to load .......I really liked kik I would give it 5 stars if it got fixed
0345803485|4.0|I really enjoyed Fifty Shades for the mommy porn aspect. Admittedly, it totally turned me on. But as a reader I found myself saying, \\"C'mon, that would never happen.\\"<br />Still, overall, it was entertaining and definitely a turn on.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I loved this very touching story of two mothers who loved the same little girl.<br />One who loss her at birth and the other who was afraid she would lose her as an adult
1554072840|5.0|Combine with the dvd. Excellent for the potty training experience. Fun too. Read it to your child as she or he sits on the potty. it helps my girl enjoy learning to use it.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I absolutely LOVE google, I use it all the time! I can get meanings, information, locations, instructions,etc.....anything I need by just &#34;googling&#34; a word or subject ! 😘
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|The old non tablet app was suboptimal. This is better for tablet use. I have already bought stuff. You're welcome amazon.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|this was in syndication and i just happened upon it one saturday afternoon a few years ago. actors are great , story lines are good (even though some are liberally changed from terry goodkind's books,but still fit in the premise) so i got this season and season 1. still as good as i remember.

B00ECUARO8|4.0|McConaughey and the two boys, Ellis and Neckbone were the best.<br />I would recommend this film to young teenage boys.
1442419814|5.0|I love Scott Westerfields books, and I'm going to start collecting them. He has such unique way of looking at life. It's a great Y/A series, and even ifyou're not Y/A, it's an important message- this was a Twillight Zone episode in the 50's or 60's, for God's sake. As we continue to modify our looks, get plastic surgery, as Indian nations sell \\"lightening cream\\" for genital areas (I'm SERIOUS), as Beyonce's face is lightened on magazine covers, I think the obsession and judgement with looks is completely out of control. It seems much more mean-spirited than when I was growing up; or<br /> maybe I was just more innocent then.<br /><br />This book posits the theory that in the future, the goverment will require an operation to have everyone look the same, and that will solve all problems: because there will be only one one beauty type, one body type/height (a norm for each gender), skin color, one age, and one race (though two genders) ; and no one will be able to discriminate against each other for jobs, mates, and politics. There is an uprising against this buy a group of people. Read to see what follows.<br /><br />Frightening, terrifying, and a GREAT outline for the fascinating series of books that follow. You MUST READ this book if you're a human. It has an Orwell 3084 type of vibe to it.<br /><br />Scottt Westerfelllllldddddddd!
B00C7DGRL4|1.0|This movie is so bad it's nearly unwatchable.  I generally love escapist, mind numbingly violent, no plot movies, but this one is awful.  There is absolutely no character development.  All we know is that Hansel and Gretel hate witches and love killing them.  Save your money and your time and watch something else.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|The stop motion captures the best sentiments of the actors, director, and author. It's a classic tale updated with modern tech and modern jokes and themes. It's beautiful with all the ticks and thoughtful touches. The details alone are enough to make you wanna watch up close. In PJ's, with the bother of popcorn and a friend or two you'll be entertained by a story to touches on family, middle age, redemption, quirkiness of youth, being true to oneself, and the mischief of being an individual.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I had the free version for a while. Wanted to show thanks and purchased the pro almost a year ago. Very handy. It shows you how much battery you hae left and how much time you have left for the different functions ex: you can read for 2 hours ; use the internet for 1 hour. While charging, it shows you how much time left to fully charge. This app plus the rapid charger for the kindle are the best two things that I got!
B00D6DVSAE|4.0|OK, so it's not what you expect a Sting album to sound like.  We get it.  Just personal taste, but I prefer my favorite artists to push the envelope and take chances.  The question is can you broaden your musical taste to just recognize quality song writing and not be stuck in one genre forever?  The quality of this effort is B+.  It reminds me of some of Mark Knopfler's later efforts.  There are two or three week songs.  If you can't accept Sting doing Broadway musical type numbers, don't buy this recording.  If you want to hear some great songs from a great artist and songwriter stretching, then buy and enjoy.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Totally fun game and I've never paid a dime to it. I love the challenges, I love how it never seems to end either. Isn't that the fun of having a game on your device??? Its always there to play when you need a time killer. Yes you run out of &quot;energy&quot; to explore rooms after searching about 6 or 7 rooms but if you put it down and walk away it doesn't take an extremely long time to recharge, not to mention that you earn diamonds as you play which can purchase items to recharge your energy if you want to keep playing. I don't know why anyone would complain that you have to buy anything with actual money, I never have. I love this game and am totally addicted to it. I would recommend it to anyone who likes 'I spy' type games! :)
B00F96P8S4|5.0|One of the best from Cher.  Especially like the bonus tracks.  Well worth it.  It's currently in the top ten on Billboard.  Her highest album debut to date!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to read for those over 50.  Conveniently located on my kindle.  I highly reccommend this calculator for seniors.  it is very useful.
B00F0AI9Y4|5.0|Didn't know what to expect from this Avicii album.  Just heard the preview samples and took a chance.  It's AWESOME!!!
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|This would be great if I had smaller fingers or larger screen,<br />I had trouble reading the screen in brighter light conditions.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|This book does not delve into the problems of women in prison or the ways in which women get around the rules.  It really only covers the obvious and goes over and over that until you're bored.  I was surprised that I became bored and was disappointed with that.
B006CHML4I|3.0|Overall the watch looks good but when you wear it on your wrist itches. The band´s material is not very good quality and detailed finishes are very careless. The band itchy like a hell.. and that sux!

1401937519|5.0|It's a wonderful book for those who are interested in afterlife. As soon as I received it from Amazon I have been reading it non-stop. I highly recommanded it!
B008D28HYS|5.0|really just a great time killing, make-your-brain-think, game! tons of levels to keep you busy, for all ages.  very happy.
B005ARYEY6|5.0|Fantastic audio quality and wonderful concert selection. DVD footage is also great quality. I can't wait to see what selections the Bootleg series has in store for us in the future!
B002VH7P4O|5.0|I bought a plastic artificial apple on EBay for about a dollar, pulled out the stem, cut off the bottom extension that went into the apple, then epoxied the stem on my USB. It is a bit longer that the original but I like it like that. Looks and works great. I actually had a bit of the metal stem still attached so I hollowed out the bottom end of the stem to overlap that to increase the bond.  If you want a picture stuvw@bigpond.com.<br />My insert is missing, so if anyone would be good enough to scan both sides and email, I would appreciate it.<br />Cheers.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Randy Weis<br /><br />Starts off simply but turns into a serious adventure. Interesting premise and endearing characters keep the pages turning. I will continue to read this author and other books on the series.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm perhaps a bit behind times, but I read this novel as I flew to Indianapolis of all places. I love a novel which melts time, especially time in a sardine can hurtling through the air. I admire Green's mastery of the YA genre and his ability to broach a tough subject without straying into the maudlin. Great story, great characters. A winner--a good thing that Newbery agreed.
B0089LOG02|4.0|An interesting story about two orphaned women that grew up in different times that came together to help each other.  I wasn't thrilled about the ending. I hope that it means there's a sequel to this book
B004SDEP38|4.0|I used this exclusively until Microsoft came out with it's Android apps.  I still keep it, and use it for my PDFs.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the best horse game I have found on the market. Interactive and educational, it teaches caretaker skills and money management in order to buy certain things. A wonderful game and highly motivating a d recommended for any age.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|So...<br />if you like temple run, I would DEFINITELY recommend this app to you.If you have never played temple run.... that's alright it is still a really awesome game to play in you freetime
B00785P2QC|4.0|There is a lot of post on Facebook stuff which  I can't go on Facebook but I put it on 4 stars it's good as far as the building part
B00EQ0CKRQ|1.0|When you start out YOU can earn points fairly easy. By the trine YOU get to level 4 there are races you can only race unless you buy the car or points to buy the car for that race. either way is the same. You pay!!!!!. The game is designed  to get too competitive to where you have to upgrade to win.  For 59.00 you can get a bad ads game for x box or ps3.  Well over 100.00 can be spent on this game. Unless your an absolute flawless driver who can win the computer hitting all the right stuff, finding the shortest route and not making one mistake. I'm average I need that extra edge to win. But like I said your BE able to earn your points in the beginning. But by level 4 you'll have paid money already and about ready to make bigger point or car purchases.  Fun game but most games that are bought at the app store are designed t o make money. They're not free not free!!!!!!!!! . I've decided to take the game as far as I can without paying more.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a Despicable Me version of Temple Run and it is a great way to spend down time!! This game definitely could be priced at at least $0.99 and still be worth the money, but this game is free!!! Definitely a must buy!!
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|[...]<br /><br />I just want to start off by saying, how gosh darn cute is that cover? Not that I'm too surprised by it, especially after reading Rainbow Rowell's \\"Eleanor & Park\\", which was ridiculously cute. And I don't mean 'cute' in the belittling, patronizing way. Oh no. What I love about Ms. Rowell's books is that sure, they're cute, but they have a darker undertone in them, one that tells her readers about the unpleasant realities in life. And that's what life is: at times, it can be gushingly cute, and in others, it can be a real slap in the face. \\"Fangirl\\" was released just last month, and of course I had to get my grubby hands on it. And when I did, I found myself sucked into yet another fantastic story about real, human life.<br /><br />Cath is sure of three things in life. First, she doesn't know what she'd do without her twin, Wren. Second, starting college stinks. And third, she is irrevocably, undeniably a Simon Snow fan. Okay, the whole world is a Simon Snow fan, but for Cath, being a fan is her entire life--and she's really good at it. In fact, her Simon Snow fan fiction has won her a more than a few fans of her own. But when the time to start freshman year in college hits, and Wren begins to move away from fandom, Cath finds herself entirely on her own, completely outside of her comfort zone. With only her laptop as her sole constant companion, Cath needs to face huge changes ahead. The question is, can she do it? Is she ready to start her own life, write her own stories? And does she even want to, if it means having to leave Simon Snow behind?<br /><br />I think I can confidently say now that I love Ms. Rowell's characters. They're not perfect--not even close. They can be awkward, self-conscious, not the prettiest person on the street... you get the picture. But this is precisely what makes them so undeniably real. You could probably tell this already from the synopsis, but Cath is most definitely not the perfect girl. She prefers the fiction world to the real world, and finds a lot of difficulty in adjusting to changes. And in this, I found a little bit of myself in it! Having started my own freshman year in college, I was really able to relate to what Cath was going through. Finding your niche, homesickness, settling into a completely different lifestyle--these were all things I'd experienced, and still am! It's this moment of connection between a character and yourself, when you go, \\"Hey, she's a little like me!\\", that you truly begin to relate and become invested in. You can even begin to learn from Cath's story and become inspired to do something in your own life--just like how I got a little kick in the butt to get writing, just like how Cath was. There's just something almost magical about these kinds of deep connections with a character in a book, and for that alone, I'm actually grateful to Ms. Rowell--and Cath!<br /><br />The rest of the characters in \\"Fangirl\\" are just as equally as amazing, I don't even know where to start! Wren is the perfect complement to Cath. Sure, they're twins, but Wren's always been the more outgoing, confident one in the pair. When she begins to put herself out there more in college, she becomes a great foil for Cath, and it's intriguing and heartbreaking all at once to see how their relationship changes throughout the course of the novel. You also have Reagan, Cath's surly roommate who oozes sexuality and a devil-may-care attitude, and I loved seeing their friendship/roommateship develop as well. Then there's Cath and Wren's dad, who's loving but fragile after their mom left them. It is so sweet to read about the bond between Cath and her dad, how the filial dynamics aren't quite what we're used to seeing in our own lives or even in other books. They're protective of each other, and it just makes me miss my own parents more (dammit, Ms. Rowell!). There's also Nick, Cath's writing partner in her Fiction-Writing class. And then, of course, you have Levi, Reagan's charming,perpetually-smiling boyfriend who's always hanging out in their room. Lemme just say that this is one amazing cast of characters--one you'll fall in love with and shake your head at and laugh with, all at once.<br /><br />Ms. Rowell has done a wonderful job in creating a great storyline that remains compelling and exciting throughout, even if there are no blood-pumping action scenes or anything of that sort. Everything is so fluid and smooth, it's like you're just there with Cath the entire time as the story progresses, no bumps that jerk you out of the story. I think this is a really important aspect of any realistic fiction, this fine balance between boring and unbelievable, and Ms. Rowell is awesome at keeping her readers engaged. I did feel like some parts, especially toward the middle, were a little dragged on, but it never did so to the extent that I got bored. I also love, love, love the way the chapters of the novel alternated with little excerpts from Simon Snow books or Cath's writing--they tie in together in such subtle ways and enhance the novel as a whole! Not to mention that ending. Just, wow. It floored me.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Fangirl\\" is a fantastic coming-of-age novel that you have to go pick up at a bookstore now. With an incredibly relatable protagonist, a dynamic and exciting cast of characters, and some amazing storytelling, it's a read that's not to be missed.<br /><br />Rating: 5/5

0761172726|5.0|I have been using this calendar for years and years.  With 4 school-age kids, I love how easy it is to scan down a column or across a day and see what's going on instantly.  This year, I thought I would make the switch to a modified traditional weekly grid calendar.  The first week of September, I got the newfangled calendar all filled in and hung it on the fridge.  Honestly, I tried, I really did -- but after two weeks I said \\"I HAVE to go back to the Boynton calendar!\\"  And I am so much happier!  Re: some other comments - yes, the pages are slick, but ballpoint works fine, and you can use white-out if you need to.  (and almost all commercial calendars are on slick paper).  And if you get in the habit of using small and tidy handwriting, you can easily fit 3 or even 4 activities in each box - trust me!
1608871827|3.0|was ok, if you loved the film you'd probably love this one.<br />but didn't have that much extra content that i was expecting, all could be seen in the movie...
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|I've only been playing this game far a fairly short time but I'm already wishing it simply would go on for ages. Hate to see it end!  This is one of the better of several I've played in this genre.  Go for it and try it now!  I seriously doubt you'll be disappointed....
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Yeah, I love it. It was kind of hard to understand at first, but it came to me and it will you. They have some bugs with the &quot;power ups&quot;, they just do not last for the time that they say they should....ever...very frustrating. I have sent over ten real bills on this game and still love it. That speaks volumes in my virtual world. Hope you love it too.Opp
B008K6HN8I|1.0|My Kindle Fire HD came without instructions.  After using it for a short time, I began to encounter problems opening videos on FB and Hotmail because I hadn't downloaded the Adobe app. required.  When I tried, the links were missing.  In a phone chat, I was told that Adobe had ceased developing the necessary program and was not offered a solution by Amazon.  Friends suggested I go on YouTube to find a solution.  Well, they said buy ES File Explorer and then watch a fuzzy, unintelligible video on YouTube and learn how to install it, then download some other program which would solve the Adobe glitch.  I was unable to accomplish the sequence of links and gave up, and returned the whole shebang to Amazon.  I'm not very impressed with Amazon's customer service.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is such a great game. The graphics are so active it keeps my child interested! It is safe for all ages to use and I don't have to worry about him finding something scary or shady on the game. Thank you for making this game!
B00CJVZB5W|5.0|I really enjoyed the mellowness of the singing on this CD by the group. It wasn't their usual DooWop sound, which I love, but instead a sound that you could basically sit back and relax and listen to. I really enjoyed the CD.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|If you enjoyed the series at all, this was a great way to conclude it for the fans of the show.
B000085RPU|5.0|Awesome movie and was so missed since our only copy had been VHS. Made for a nice present and was loved.
B0095VPBFY|3.0|Well, what can I say about this processor...<br /><br />Great price for a processor. Great starting point for a cheap build. Building a HTPC? I'd definitely consider this guy. It was easy to install. The fan works surprisingly well, never had my processor go above 45℃ (no gaming though). And the fan was almost completely silent, too.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are some minor quirks. Using Windows 8, the system worked okay. Lots of lag and stutters. And Windows 8 generally runs faster than previous versions, too (not that I am a huge fan). Everything starts, but it takes a second or two to load. Additionally, you HAVE to install the AMD drivers before you can utilize all the graphics resolution. No big deal, just a heads up.<br /><br />In the end, I ended up returning this guy and purchasing a more powerful A8-6600k. While I use the processor to power a part-time HTPC, I also power a part-time cloud server. The A6 chip probably would've been adequate, but I was just not won over by it's performance during the day to day grind. If you are less needy than me, it'd be a great deal.<br /><br />My build:<br />MSI FM2-A75IA-E53 mini-itx board<br />FSP 350w PSU<br />OCZ Vertex III SSD<br />Silverstone SG06 case<br />4gb Kingston KHX memory<br />Stock/included CPU cooler

B00B89WXYS|5.0|It is addicting. I've been playing it the whole day. I don't I'll get bored by it anytime soon. It's just simply addicting music.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I liked it, but then, I like a bit of gore. I think it was a bit gratuitous in nature, but the film wasn't bad for what it is: a futuristic fantasy action movie. 4/5
B000XUBFE2|5.0|What an incredible read, I fell in love with this story and found myself crying both tears of joy and tears of sadness as I went through the pages. Really beautiful and vivid, I've been recommending this book ever since I finished it.
B00B1D7ANK|5.0|I tested this cool Dragon Rider Toy on my five year old grandson and he absolutely loved it.  The wings come off as does the rider and he spent hours playing with the dragon and the \\"lizard\\" as he called it without the wings.  The wings snap right back into place easy enough for a young child to assemble them.  I plan to give this to all the little boys in my family for Christmas.  A super, fun, durable toy.

0440245915|3.0|A Time to Kill was the first Grisham novel I read and I loved it at that time in my very young life. It was a page turner, and, at that time, I didn't look for much depth in a novel. Twenty years later, with a new interest in technique, I'm rereading this book to \\"see how it's done.\\" While I still admire Grisham as a master of the page-turner, I was surprised to see how much of his style bothered me deeply. I agree with the other reviewers that his opinion and treatment of the women in his novels is rather appalling, especially in the case of the long-suffering Ethel, Jake Brigance's inherited assistant in A Time to Kill, whom he bullies or ignores, in turn, for no apparent reason other than he just doesn't like her. Nowhere in the novel does he explain why Jake treats her so disrespectfully. At one point, young Jake literally gets in her face, \\"until their noses were six inches apart,\\" and asks, \\"Would you like to keep your job, Ethel?\\" as she quivers in fear, \\"unable to speak.\\" For a Mississippi man, Grisham evidences very little of the southern gentleman in any of his main characters. To anyone brought up in the south, Jake's treatment of his sixty-something, female assistant is shocking, a portrayal of redneck behavior at its finest from a character who is supposed to be the antithesis of a redneck. Another irksome trait of the young Brigance is his petty childishness throughout the novel. He takes pleasure in being a jerk to his adversaries whenever the opportunity presents itself: repeatedly calling the Sullivan firm's attorneys by their first initial and middle name in a laughable attempt at direct contempt towards them. Demonstrative of kindergarten behavior, Jake also repeatedly calls his opponent \\"Governor\\" when it becomes apparent it makes him angry. Grisham's characters delight in pushing buttons.<br /><br />Grisham clearly models his protagonists after himself, and in doing so reveals himself to be an arrogant, sophomoric boor, especially by his main characters' chronic lack of civility and ungentlemanly behavior at times; this is evident in many of his books. I read The Firm right after A Time to Kill and loved it also, at the time. I continued to read all of Grisham's works as they came out and soon found he was using the same basic outline in all of them, and my excitement at a new Grisham novel quickly turned into boredom. In addition, he ramped up his personal opinions in the subsequent novels. One in particular, can't remember the title, in which he holds a rabidly purulent disdain for a sub-character's girlfriend because she is a \\"crunchy\\" woman, into hiking and health foods, was the final straw for me. His never-ending vigorous distaste for her being \\"crunchy\\" became overkill and made me close the book midway, and the door on any subsequent Grisham novels. He had begun to remind me of a character from the 50s, who believed proper women should stay at home, cleaning the house in a frilly apron and high heels. Jake Brigance's wife is an 80s representation of this model, waiting to have her own dinner with young Jake no matter what time he comes home from the office, be it six PM or ten. His writing after A Time to Kill and The Firm had taken a formulaic turn in which Grisham's characters were cardboard and his novels nothing more than a platform to spout his dated viewpoint with childish and annoying repetition.<br /><br />I still believe Grisham has a gift for storytelling and suspense, into which he intersperses occasional comedic wit, that will keep you turning the pages. But, by inserting his own irritating and close-minded personality into his characters, he shoots himself in the foot, forcing the reader to put the book down forever in disgust. Not sure if he can fix that. But it does give me insight on what not to do in my own writing. Gotta give Grisham credit where it's due, and learn from his flaws.
1596177373|5.0|Super happy with the product and always impressed by the fast efficient shipping! And it's important to me since I collect Tim Burton items I expect them to be in immaculate shape.
B001VU1NJ0|1.0|I was totally disgusted by the ending scenes in this movie. I couldn't understand how Jimmy's wife could compare him to a king and her remarks on - what kind of a wife Celeste is also disgusts me. Celeste was wrong to have misunderstood Dave, she did not understand the mental issues he had, however she based her decisions on the strange way he was acting. She is more a human being than Jimmy's shameless wife.
B00867HDTA|5.0|Amazing game, very adictive :)<br />I feel like Ronaldo while playing it!<br />I wish there is some handy manual that explains how to kick it to go up, it takes some time to figure it out ...
B006ON41FC|5.0|It's a quick, fun break from any serious project I'm doing...my own personal reward system!  Also a great training tool for eye/hand coordination.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|I can't stop playing this game :)<br />The characters and effects when crash are so well thought and presented.<br />I wish there were options to either speed up or slow down the good character ...
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This book holds a special place in my heart.  I read this book when I was 12 while my mother was doing research on her father who fought in the same battles as the author in an adjacent regiment.  E.B. Sledge describes the horrors of combat, and the day to day life of an infantry Marine with a clarity that is unlike any other World War Two book I have ever read.  He does not attempt to glorify himself, the Marine Corps, or combat itself, rather, he simply tells it as he saw it.  At the same time you come away with the realization that these were special men who fought, bled and died in the worst conditions imaginable.  I remember putting the book down and thinking, \\"how could they endure such things?\\"  This book should be required reading for anyone interested in joining the military regardless of branch of service.  These men where my heroes growing up and still are.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|My dvd is great.thank you.the package was just what i expected.the price was good.i will look to order from this seller in the near future.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King is a writer. That's the highest praise I know. Mere words like brilliant can not do it justice. I could write reams of commentary but will just say, thank you for another great read.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Very good book and series. It has a lot of scrap you need to sift through but over all very good.
B00F52YOPA|4.0|I really am enjoying this game.  the objects are fairly easy to find.  lots of selection to decorate the room.  the screens move smoothly when I click on objects they respond quite well.<br /><br />I hope I can find more of this quality.<br /><br />OK,  I am adding to the review.  I got to the end of the game.  The bad part it only had one room.  The other bad part -  once you go through the entire game it just ends.  I didn't get an opportunity to replay it from the start.<br /><br />I have deleted it from my phone.
B000SXLL8O|5.0|What's not to love about any music put out by Coldplay!  I've loved their music since I first heard 'Yellow'.

B005NPBT5M|5.0|I don't buy a lot of music, but like most of the music put out by Pink Floyd.  I listen to it on my iPhone while walking my Schipperke.
8675600224|1.0|This is NOT an illustrated addition, so annoying. I guess I'll keep it and read it anyway, so that is my review

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I love the way this book is written, a great sense of humor and writing style.<br />Great tips, quotes and an inspirational book.<br />Loved reading it...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Such an awsome game! I love how there's different backgrounds you can play on, and how each place have different challenges and obstacles. If you like minions and temple run, this is the game for  you! I'll admit it's a little glitchy but I guess that's cause it's high quality
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome Product.  Very easy to set up.  Once Google allows developers full control to develop more apps (Plex Please).  This product will turn all TVs  &#34;Smart&#34;
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|The idea of world full of powerful anti-heros isn't such a novelty, but it provides a challenge and direction for the young, male hero.  Such possibility.<br /><br />I immediately found it difficult to identify with the main character whose back story is that he has absolutely no friends or family despite spending roughly half of his life with the same social group in a post apocalyptic world.  A city turned almost entirely to steel can be imagined, but the author doesn't spend sufficient effort to explore the true implications of such a phenomenon or believably adapt the inhabitant lifestyle to this strange condition.  I love science fiction, fantasy and magic systems, but his development is both completely lacking and far from consistent with the premise.  This world doesn't know whether to be science fiction or fantasy.  Rather than adjusting life to a world gone cold, hard, slippery, and conductive or taking the opportunity to explore it and make it a believable, integral part of the story, he simply hangs it up as a backdrop for a nonstop action sequence.  Magical physics defying mobile phones certainly are convenient in a metal city.<br /><br />Our main character is unbelievably fearless and goes full throttle on the aggression from the beginning.  He turns out to be both instinctively lethal and absurdly lucky which also makes it difficult to identify with him.  He does, however, start to build a hormonal relationship with a young woman early on.  This is a welcome counterpoint to the action sequence, but gets interrupted in a contrived plot device which strangely only seems to affect our hero.  Steelheart is seriously lacking in emotional intensity; it feels more like a plot sketch or a comic.<br /><br />In summary, Sanderson provides colorful characters, continuous action, and isn't too afraid to explore killing people off, but just about everything else is missing.  All in all it is easy, mindless adolescent reading, but without believability or depth.  Iwill give it the edible fast food rating of 3 stars since there is a time and a place for it.  Unfortunately, I normally prefer the harder to find five star meals and I'm left with the distinct feeling that Sanderson's latest books are churned out to maximize income.  If you are looking for a masterfully crafted epic, check out his earlier Mistborn series.
1905113153|5.0|This is the most beautiful cake decorating book. Wonderful cakes, clear instructions. Worth every penny and then some. If you have wanted to improve your cake decorating skills, this book will absolutely help you.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I loved this book - the character development, the plot development, the themes of identity, inclusion/exclusion, loyalty, betrayal, sacrifice (just to name a few).  I also enjoyed having a lens into the N. Korean culture and government.  It was an intense read for me, and I stayed drawn in the whole book.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I try to stay up on these matters being a coach and consultant. This book was easy to read and helpful.
1426308469|5.0|This was for my grandson. I have not seen it. But did see it on Skpye. Looked cute. He seems to be enjoying it.
B00F35BV64|2.0|Everything that's wrong with modern cinema in 2:13. Lose the lens flares JJ!  Very distracting and obnoxious. This was a terrible follow on to the first in the new series.  Predictable, pedantic, and a pathetic overture to 70's disaster movies. Skip it.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|Having the kit has made it much easier to get photos off my iPhone camera.  But it can have problems when it comes time to delete the photos from the iPhone.  Sometimes it's hard to tell if the photos are being deleted, forcing me to compare the ones on my iPhone with the ones on my iPad.  It really should work better than that. I can't say for sure that it's the fault of the kit, as it could be a problem in iOS.
B000MNP2K8|1.0|Love the movie but after watching it one time it no longer worked.  The disk says that there is nothing on it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Little bit confusing in the middle but it worked out and I enjoyed it.  Wanted to find out what happened so I was excited to finish it.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Fun game that makes you think in order to play!  Love riddle and picture word games!  Definitely worth the money!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game.  lots of puzzles and choose your difficulty levels. each puzzle gives a few hints if needed.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Like most theater goers, I'd heard all my life that Hamlet, was the greatest Shakespeare play, and the definitive role for a young actor. I never understood it until I saw this movie. It's not surpring. The previous film versions are all cut down. I'd known that, but had assumed that the cuts left the story pretty much intact.<br /><br />When I saw this version it was clear how wrong I had been. Hamlet is much more about court intrigue, and less about hand wringing than I had understood. The twists and turns add to the suspense. In the full Hamlet the viewer sees how close Hamlet comes to saving the day. He is brilliant and employs one trick after another, not just to exact revenge, but to save his court and country.<br /><br />This Hamlet is brilliantly staged and gorgeous. One great performance follows another. The extras in this set, add a lot, and are well worth the price.<br /><br />Best of all, viewing can be broken up. Even a great production of Hamlet can be hard to sit though. It's a long, long play. With this Hamlet you can watch an hour a night and really enjoy it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I hope that you are doing it more and more and more and more and more and more and and more and even more. I want there to be new updates every week.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone. It was a very interesting read, particularly having grown up Christian and remembering the things I learned in Sunday school as a child. Adds a fresh perspective that just makes more sense.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Good Movie. Kinda dull at times. Really leaves you hanging at the end. Needs more story line . Definite sequel needed.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I had trouble in the begining with this book.  But as the pieces started to come together<br />it turned out to be good.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|A fun game of logic and bluffing.  Win the heart of the Princess by getting your letters to her and keeping other courtiers away.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I liked the comparison between then & now.  The Orphan Train was part of history, which is a sad comentary<br />It was an excellent read.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Outstanding!  It was 95% accurate in its details -- i.e. Pike did not die as he was in future episodes.  Gather the family and the popcorn for some intense viewing.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really have fun playing bingo. I love the different rooms. Especially the Elvis room. Sometimes it does not credit properly, but not that often so far. It is addictive!!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This has helped...once I get the charger light on. Sometimes I feel like giving up. I will try to keep it going. Thinking of going to the newest Kindle tablet? or an iPad.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I couldn't stop reading. Great read.  Well put together with great inside into Elizabethan England!  Loved it.  Makes you want to open your mind to the possibilities!
B00241YHMU|5.0|This was a really interesting movie of time going backward for Benjamin (Brad Pitt).  Really heart felt almost like a story of the ugly duckling.  One person who raised a badly deformed child as her own, she loved and cared for him.  Only to find out that he was from a well to do family.  Acting was great and the story line was believable.  A movie that you could watch over and over again and really enjoy it.
0770437400|4.0|Well thought out book. Wasn't sure I would like the books format of being a series of interviews, but turned out to actually enhance the story.
B000000XB8|5.0|Great price, records were perfect, and you just really can't beat CCR! I Highly recommend this album to any fan, and anyone (like me) that love vinyls and wants to expand their collection!
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|Love this show! This is my favorite show of all time, it always makes me laugh until I cry no matter what .
B0089LOG02|4.0|Never knew what an orphan train was but learned in this well written story. A must read for historical fiction fans!
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|This was a delightful tale and an awesome addition to my Studio Ghibli collection.<br /><br />Without spilling the beans the reason I liked this story so much is because it was lighthearted, fun and I also appreciated historical background.  The interesting mystery of the characters buildup was initially concerning, sad and amazing all at once. If you enjoyed any of Goro or Hayao Miyazaki's past productions this one fits in place. I hope Goro Miyazaki follows his own path, this production proves that he has the ability. As we wish Hayao Miyazaki best wishes and farewell in his retirement I feel this piece with his contributions and influence is an excellent addition to any anime collection.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this as much as I did. I am looking forward to The Wind Rises.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|great story, never would have guessed his secret.  Kept me reading and well written.  Has something for everyone. Loved it.
0307394549|5.0|Excellent condition; arrived soon. Every imaginable cookie recipe you can think of is in this book. As I always say: Martha's books are explained step-by-step with a lot of step-by-step photos, so you can see how you're supposed to do things, and how the finished product should look. Simple to follow instructions.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|It's nice to see someone come up with a new concept for a movie, since so many plots have been reworked over the years.  The story line is pretty coherent in that it looks like something that could really happen. The director does a great job of getting you into the movie with the actors, who are believeable in their roles. The dialogue isn't stupid or cheesy like in some movies. The best part is that the movie has just the right mix of action, drama, and emotion - mostly action. Many movies depend on emotion and drama to carry the movie, but Gravity is pretty straightforward in that it concentrates on the story, which keeps the movie moving.<br /><br />I promise you won't be bored, never a dull moment. A really excellent film!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|I thought that it was a really great movie, filled with a lot of action. Some of the reviews that I read wasn't that favorable, but I really enjoyed the movie, and will definitely watch it again.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|One of the best games I've played in a long time. The graphics are excellent<br />and the way it makes you move around to find objects.<br />Keep up the great work.
B0000894RZ|5.0|The seller was prompt & fast & presented in excellent condition a lady of royalty in voice! I absoutely love Lisa and All Woman should be played now! That song will never die! She has an excellent band! Great funky beats!!! Who are they playing for now? Don't let any of them go to waste! Thanks for giving me great listening pleasure!
0547564651|5.0|This book does a great job at showing what makes children more likely to be successful. It shows reality and not just the misconception that only geniuses will succeed and in fact many will fail at life. Overall it is an easy read and the information is very interesting.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|It was a fast AND easy entertaining read.  I thoroughly ejoyed my time spent as will you, I am sure..
B00E9P959O|5.0|Like many others have said here, the original VT release was marred with poor sound quality to the point where it was literally unlistenable. You'd give it a once through and find yourself constantly adjusting the audio settings on the amp. In short, the album was awful, ruined by poor sound, which was a shame because there were a lot of solid songs on it.  Unfortunately, I just chalked it up in the \\"not meant to be\\" category and systematically shelved it considering it to be one of their weaker efforts;  Essentially I didn't give it a chance.<br /><br />So, for $9.00 I picked up this remixed version and, all I can say is, wow!  It essentially is a new Rush album.  You can finally hear every little nuance (which all of us Rush heads love to digest) in rich awesome sound.  I've given VT about 3 full listen throughs and can honestly say it's one of their best albums, ever; and that's saying something because, like many other older fans, I consider the first half of their career to be their best work.<br /><br />If I had to complain about anything, it's that some of the guitar power cords and/or bass parts are a little subdued in climax sections of some of the songs but that's a very small niggle. If you're a dyed in the wool Rush fan, now you've got an alternate version of an excellent album to have in your catalog.  If you're new to Rush or just a casual listener, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.  Job well done.  5-stars.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The end of my favorite read and sorry to see it finished. While not how I would have pictured Robert Jordan finishing off his &#34;exquisite&#34; tale, Sanderson did a wonderful job in completing the Wheel of Time and kept me thoroughly engrossed. Good bye Wheel of Time and thank you.
B002UBRFDC|4.0|A great novel like all Clavell's other novels. I read it for the second time. The insight to the Japanese history and culture, even the language, is very interesting.
0756655307|5.0|I got this book for my 11 year old sons birthday and he absolutely loves it! Would recommend to anyone who loves comics.
B0012QTT4O|5.0|I am just amazed with every single episode of this series, it is so well written and acted by an amazing cast with a Brian Cranston we have never met before as Walter White, and Aaron Paul, who plays Jessie Pinkman, a character that is perfect as Walt's business partner. The entire cast of this show is just amazing, and the story line is absolutely flawless in every way. This show is definitely made for adult viewing, which is clear from the first episode. I have never been so glued to my seat watching anything like I have with this show. Not wanting to give anything away regarding the story, but this is perfection if you aren't averse to some very adult viewing. This show has you going OMG one minute and laughing the next. Bravo to Vince Gilligan who wrote this and to the excellent cast for bringing it to life. What a wild ride!!!!
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|Wow, how I love all those Bootleg Series releases!!! Vol. 10 is such a gem, I'm getting sucked into it by the minute. So many great moments there, Dylan's voice so strong... That was an amazing sort of in between time, and what a treasure it is!    10 classic volumes of the Bootleg Series in a little more than 20 years... Just keep 'em coming, Columbia!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Even though I paid for my music by credit card, it took days before it hit my cloud and I could hear it on my phone.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Keep in mind that there are only three 90-min-long episodes in a season. The show is very well done though. It's Sherlock Holmes set in modern times. The way technology is integrated is clever.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love games like this one: every level is a new challenge, and the highest ones are really brain exciting!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really love this app from humor to art its a really great time spender although its a bit addictive
B000GT7XXW|2.0|I did not get very far into this to know I would not enjoy it. For me, it is too slow.
B00EXVZZE8|4.0|Its a great game and pretty addicting i definitely reccomend it. It is totally awesome. AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! Hooray for Nyan!
B000J159N8|5.0|I did not watch this movie here. I tried to buy it while in the streaming area. I wanted a DVD. I got an on line copy that I did not need because I have &#34;Prime.&#34; Anyway, if you want a good war flic, a realistic one, this one fills the bill. It is my favorite war movie. I like it even more than &#34;Saving Private Ryan,&#34; or, &#34;Platoon!&#34;
B00992CF6W|5.0|Wow. I recomend it more than any other game and you will love it.all the updates make it even,better. The pictures are out of date because its even cooler. There is survival, and creative and you can get it for kindle. I have it on my kindle fire, Xbox, and computer. AMAZINGLY AWESOME!!!!!!!!
B001AQQR2S|5.0|This movie is my great grandaughter's favorite movie of all time. She loved it so much, we wound up naming our new puppy<br />Matilda. lol
B00594XOZU|1.0|Haven't had a problem with this app until today. It won't let you log in if you undownload it and then redownload it the app doesn't work.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitare is a game for passing the time. It's a great way to keep the memory active and alert also.
B005DNPJKU|5.0|I have no idea what I was going to expect before I watched this movie, but it completely blew me away. As a mother, this movie broke my heart and warmed it as well. Highly recomended.
B004UID2LC|3.0|You tube is something that you could spend hours watching. Even the kids love it. Some of the clips are hilarious.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Simple but entertaining. Fun to play at any level. Variety of plague types. So much playability.but so hard to master
B009D5VNLS|5.0|This such a super movie for children, especially girls. It teaches some great life lessons to children they will need
B00BMUVW5O|5.0|I ordered the hard cover book from England since I did not want to wait for it to become available in the U.S.  It is every bit as wonderful as the first book!  Having had a dear orange tabby that appears to have been Bob's twin, and having lost him about a year ago after a 4 year bout with diabetes at age 16, it was especially touching to me...  Such a wonderful story, so human (and feline), and told in such a way that you feel you are there and sharing the emotions of man and cat.  I do hope there will be a third outing!
B004DM1ZQY|2.0|I crank up the difficulty and win very few initial rolls.  Also my rolls are low throughout the game.  If I put the computer in the center then it always rolls the right number to put mine in the center.  Seems kind of fishy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|They are a fun family to watch. I can't wait to see what happens next season.  Nice to have some modesty on television for a change.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Had a couple of hours so decided to watch a movie and choose this one. Plenty of action, not too gorey and the plot was ok. Good syfi flick.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This medium is fine for getting in touch with friends and family.  It also gives you an opportunity to connect to classmates.  I enjoy liking pages of stores and such so I get info from them.  I do not like when people use the comments section to hype their stay-at-home and earn money jobs or stuff like that.  I like that you can remove unwanted information and prevent it from showing up again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game, it is a very fun realistic game. I love it! I really like horses so i really like this app, it makes me feel like i really do have a horse!
B0009U55SI|5.0|Mahler was one of my study @NMU.  I have a great admiration of his music and the interesting trials he endured.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|I just finished watching the complete second season of Homeland. I preordered this as soon as it was available to do so.  After I watched season one I couldn't wait for season two.  It's been a while since I liked a TV series this much.  I don't get Showtime so I have to wait for these to come out on DVD and I try not to read much about it in the meantime so that I'll be really surprised.  I couldn't figure out how season two was going to go since Carrie was pretty much out of commission.  They did a great job working all of that out and I enjoyed this season just as much as the first.  I really sucked in a breath a couple times while watching this.  The OMG moments were real breath takers. There are some real shocking moments in this season and I wasn't aware that not everyone would be moving on to season three.  I won't say more than that.  I know it's going to be a while before season three is out but you can be sure I'll order it ASAA. (as soon as available)  Just a note...this show is on Showtime so there is some sex and quite a bit of violence.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love the BBC Sherlock and was therefore a bit apprehensive about this show but I quickly became hooked. The acting is brilliant and the storyline is enthralling.<br /><br />The first few episodes Aidan Quinn seems to be unrehearsed and uncommitted but he gets much better. Give him a chance.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Matilda is one of those movies that no matter how many times you see it, it captivates you. I love Danny DeVito and Rhea Pearlman, but Mara Wilson steals the show. It is something I can watch with my family and have deep belly laughs and even an emotional moment or two. The movie is kinda corny at times, but it is a cute and funny corny. I really love this movie and so does my daughter, I vendors though it came out before she was born.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I'm a big Grisham fan. This one was as enjoyable as usual.  I had the very rare opportunity to spend the day reading and couldn't put it down until I finished.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Exciting adventure, but just wished it covered the whole book instead of stopping midway through.  Luckily part 2 will be in the theaters soon.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|Have never had this product glitch, sync's with my android phone perfectly and even supports me to walk more often.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|Really great series! The second season is just as good as the first! I really enjoyed this series so far!!!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I didn't read the first in the series, but I really loved The name of the wind! Very entertainiNg, and lots to read- kept me going for awhile!
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Wish more would have been answered about life after it all but i guess they had to leave room for another book if interest peaked...
B005LAIIMG|5.0|This movie was one of the best this year keeping me on edge the who way through. I was like dawn of the dead mixed with left for dead without the special zombies. Nothing but love for this movie.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed The Husband's Secret.  There were many twists and turns and it really moved quickly and held my interest.  I highly recommend it!
B003B02O0A|5.0|My first time reading this Author, he makes a very exciting, and without having to fil the pages with useless words (swear) etc. I have read another of his books, and plan on reading a lot more of him. I do like a change of pace so read one other author and than go back to John Grisham. Be prepared to get behind on your chores as it is very hard to put down
B003O86FMW|4.0|Was so refreshing to be able to read a book about relationships developing between people that didn't have to be interspersed with non related sexual and other scenes. Can let my children read this book. Loved the continuity from the original.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Well written with surprising twists and turns causing me to experience the emotional roller coaster William Landay so aptly describes
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It's well done and addicting, the story line really makes you want to figure out the mystery. And the difficulty levels are gradual.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I bought this for my husband who has been watching Star Trek since a young boy. He really enjoyed it. I was able myself to keep up with all the action.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Easy going game, a bit hard to keep track of the trucks however. But all in all a nice game to spend time in.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|A good tale of espionage and intriguing at the same time. Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie do a fine job. Interesting from beginning to end.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|this is my first Nicholas sparks book and I loved it. Absolutely amazing. Can't wait to read more books from him!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Entertaining and insightful.  We all need to learn that we are this powerful! When we do the human family will be in peace!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app. period. I came across it while trying to find a trivia app for Percy Jackson and the Olympians(which I did not find.): ) I loved minecraft on the pc and I gave this app a shot. Boy, am I glad I did. I loved it!!!!!!!! I only have one problem: WHERE THE KRONOS IS THE DIAMONDS?!?! I literally have not found a single one. GRRRRRRRRRR! I really want my diamond sword that you can not afford! But this app gave life a meaning that day!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Intriguing, unpredictable, clever and surprising, a page turner book!  Not sure how I feel about the ending. There were so many options!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Easy to set and the weather feature is great. Also it's nice to be able to set the amount of time I want for snooze. Easy on the eyes too with a slide dimmer.
B000I3SYEI|5.0|a, &#34;MUST HAVE&#34; for that serious Star Trek enthusiast.  i have had the VHS copy, DVD copy and HAD TO upgrade to BluRay due to my needs.
1863514201|4.0|I am a needle worker. This style has long intrigued me. Even if I never attempt a project, it is wonderful to view her work.
B00DEFW8YY|4.0|I love Helen Grimaud's playing and this recording is a joy to listen to! Unfortunately when I downloaded to my computer and uploaded too the cloud for my Kindle it was in Japanese and not the album cover...
B00ELD3MUW|1.0|The Flash Installer does not work...  It is old technology, I think.  I am probably going to uninstall it unless there is a &#34;fix&#34; for this app.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|I had heard about Firefly after watching Castle. I was intersted in seeing the show.<br />I liked it.  I think I would like to see the whole season.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I downloaded Evernote to help me transfer files from one computer to the next just like a \\"cloud.\\"  It works great that way as you can sync all your files from one computer to the next, Ipad and Kindle and your phone.  No matter where I am, my notes and files are with me.  Then I bought a livescribe pen and notebook.  They allow me to write like a normal pen which the notes are then passed through wifi to Evernote.  The pen also allows me to record voice so I was able to take my professor's lectures home.  Evernote and livescribe have revolutionized my life for school, work and home.  I highly suggest getting both. Look at livescribe on Amazon as well.  The refurbished pens are just as good as new and cheaper.  [[ASIN:B00524DLZ0 Livescribe 2 GB Echo Smartpen (APX-00008)]]
B00CZAYNOC|3.0|The first 2 albums are the best. This one is a rehash of their last album. Decent effort. Frankly I like the music. The lyrics need a lot of work. Go back to war is the answer and remember what you did there guys. : /
B00881VLCE|4.0|Love the puzzles love the way it works hate the fact that all size puzzle pieces are the same.  Needs to have shape variety to make it more challenging
1612680011|5.0|this book is awesome.. i love everything about it.. it is teaching me so many new things about my life
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I got it to keep my child busy at appointments.  She likes to use it in quiet time too. In the variety of colors tools and options you can create some nice things.  I find myself using it sometimes lol.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is amazing but sometimes its a little gross but it is fun.The main thing i love about hill climb is that it allows you to start new levels and get different vehicles
B000JMKO0A|5.0|A great read. My first dip into Paulo Coelho, but it won't be my last! Beautiful main character who gets it right in her soul.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|I bought the ex version which has wired, it was great, but the wire start tearing up and the left thumb joy stick was getting worn after about a year of use of it, however that is because i play fighting games with it. I would highly recommend this to people who love the 360 controller over the ps3 but have a ps3. there is however some lag between direction with wireless one when playing fighting games, but works perfectly for games like GTA and Saints row. overall you should get it if you looking for a nice contrller for a good price<br /><br />Pros:<br />-feels great, the grooves on the controllers are great to keep your hands feeling dry,<br />-pretty good response<br /><br />CONS<br />-minor lag<br /><br />Overall: get this thing man
B0030V0PEW|5.0|Great stories, great results. I'm glad I came across this book and recommend it to anyone seeking to improve processes and outcomes.
B000A6EXNO|5.0|Easy to go on. Blocks the light out nicely when you push your face on it completely. There will be some light on the side if you don't. Can't complain for the price.
B000002KK2|5.0|I had this as a record when it first came out years ago and really enjoy her style of singing.
B0027MJU00|5.0|After reading some of the negative reviews I realized that what they didn't like about Dark Places is exactly what I did like about it.  I like that it was a little edgier than Gone Girl and although it had some pretty violent parts they necessary for  the story to be believable  as far as I was concerned. Highly recommended!
B004WY2M8I|5.0|I love Ms. Rice's attention to detail and her accuracy in describing the locations and historical information. You can immerse yourself in the time and place and forget your own issues!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun to play! I can't seem to put it down! Fun for the whole family.
0345803507|5.0|Love the quiet strength of Ana, being with Grey forced her to realise her true potential and drop her mousiness. And, her love for him made him realise that without love you are never truly successful
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Starts easy, but just play awhile it gets challenging. Quick reflexes are a plus.<br />New twists make this a very challenging game.
0345803493|4.0|Oh the twists and turns, love it. I didn't think I would enjoy reading this series from hearing others talk about it because S & M doesn't interest me. If you can get past judging Grey and seeing that everything for him was focussed through his pain, it's an interesting book
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|All I knew about this movie was a remake of the original movie, and I had no idea what the story was about.  It was a good surprise and very different from those I usually see.  I liked the story and all the cast members.
0425263924|3.0|Too many moving parts that doesn't connect, seems a rush to finish book without a clear story. Most people I spoke to found parts of the book disgusting and didn't finish the book.
B00007LTIB|1.0|Patrick Moraz is playing keyboards on this album. Is he really? I mean, really? I dunno, that dude who gave The Moody Blues a second lease of life (well, chart success) seems buried under a wall of electric guitar that miniscules even Phil Spector.<br /><br />The mix or 'production' has been done so the guitarist is left, right and centre, every little note, every nuance. Obviously, Steve Howe, is very important, and Steve Howe must be heard over any passing-through keyboardist (Moraz) and Steve Howe's every note must be loud so the Steve Howe can be heard by the listener. Steve Howe. And Chris Squire; you can hear him too.<br /><br />What surprised me even more is that even the vocals are buried somewhere in the mix, and whenever Jon sang STEVE HOWE was soloing over the top of him.<br /><br />I don't really care about the Steve Howe thing; \\"The gates of Delirium\\" is a very good composition; I do enjoy the very skillful and imaginative and, yeah, incredible guitar playing. By Steve Howe. My how things had changed by 1991...<br /><br />But there is no thought given to the vocal passages in the first half of the song (the 'soon' part is fine); Jon has to sing really quickly and the vocals are just inserted shoddily and there's no way you would understand the lyrics without reading along with a lyrics sheet, and they're buried in the mix somewhere.<br /><br />Listening carefully, you can hardly hear Patrick Moraz, I don't even know why they bothered with a keyboard player. Just a formailty?<br /><br />\\"Sound Chaser\\" is one of the worst songs by a great band in the 70's; more like 'noise chaser', the first 30 seconds is drums and, yes, an organ, and you're thinking, ok cool, I'll get to hear the other guys on this one. But then the next eight minutes is STEVE HOWE soloing as fast and as hard and as loud as he can, with a few vocal sections delivered at high speed.<br /><br />The other song is a nice acoustic ballad, a little boring but also interesting with the sitar and stuff.<br /><br />I couldn't rate this any higher than 1 star (maybe  and a half?), seeing as how this sounds like a cacophony at high speed at its worst, and over-indulgent yet talented at its best.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|If you are looking to do complex time values or inflation rates... this is THE king.<br />Platinum does the same functions as standard, but is a bit faster.
B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|A great box putting together every album harry Nilsson released on RCA. There are three bonus discs of unreleased and alternate takes and all are in mini-lp cardboard recreations of the original lps, even the gatefolds. With 17 in all at a hundred bucks or less, its a great bargain too. The earliest lps even have stereo/mono mixes and many have onus cuts on the lps in adition to the aforementioned bonus discs.They sounds great and, if you're a Nilsson fan and want to have the full collection for a decent price, this is it. There are still variable quality collections of earlier Nilsson, pre-RCA, material, but this is what you need.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really love this game....I can spend hours playing and never notice how much time has passed.  It is very addicting and requires plenty of pre-planning for your moves!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Well written. Makes you think about what is reality and what you percieve as reality. It makes you think about what is truly important in life.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I downloaded this to my Kindle and spend hours playing the variety of choices provided.  It has traditional Mahjong, Quest and endless games.  Love it.
B00EOO55GW|2.0|I am usually pretty open when it comes to music.  I can usually find a few good tracks on most of the albums I listened to.  I usually like the Avenged Sevenfold albums a lot but this one I have a really hard time getting into.  I can honestly say none of these tracks really do it for me.  That is just my personal opinion though.....after all the hype around this album, I am pretty disappointed.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|I haven't played this game much, but I'm hoping that it is not as bad as some of the reviews.  Gameplay is fun, story is decent, and action is cool.  I agree with another reviewer that the cash shop should be for extra gear and cosmetic features, and not the only way to play.
B00CHVJI08|5.0|Could not wait for this to come out.  I just had to pre-order it so I would it get it as soon as I could.  Glad I did!  This is an awesome movie!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Great acting all around. David Tenant is the big name, but he doesn't steal the show. Highly recommend this series.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|This movie was awesome, great music too. It really makes you see the reality of relationships, I wouldn't recommended it if you just started a new relationship.
B004HWYTP4|1.0|It took over an hour to stream 2 mins of the movie.  I don't know what the problem was, but I purchased it through my Apple TV subscription and I was able to steam it live.  Of course that cost $4.99.  I guess you get what you pay for.
B006M4F67A|3.0|I love playing mong jong games. The only thing I don't like about this game is that I can't make the cards bigger.
B0076UXKDG|5.0|Great addition to my D800 camera...Allows me to shoot up to 1200 images without changing batteries and also to havr an extra shuter for vertical images.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. It is a lot of fun. I will tell everyone that plays online games to try it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I find Pinterest to be useful, informative, entertaining and educational. It is very easy to use, and one of the few social media tools with minimal potential to be offensive. I love it!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This is the story of two women and their harsh struggles as females in Afghanistan.  Hosseini does a very good job of blending hope and small happinesses into the chaos of their lives.  The story gives an awareness of the history of the country yet weaves an enjoyable personal story into it as well.<br /><br />A Thousand Splendid Suns was a page-turner for me. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B005I2YL4G|5.0|I bought this CPU for a little over $60 for a cheap gaming build. For a while I relied on the integrated graphics, but later made the decision to buy a Radeon HD 7700 series GPU. I decided to test the iGPU with Dirt 3 as it's advertised on the packaging. The game ran pretty well just under maxed settings. Overall I'm very pleased with the performance of the iGPU. It could even tackle Skyrim on Mid-High settings. While Skyrim did put up quite a fight I still found the performance was well enough to provide an enjoyable game experience. I don't use the iGPU anymore now that I have a dedicated GPU, but it still serves well for raw processing power. Just today I participated in the Battlefield 4 Beta and the processor did it's best to keep up. In my opinion it did quite well paired with my GPU. Sadly it still needs to be replaced as the performance in the game wasn't good for quality playing conditions. I've chosen to rate this 5 stars because of the extra performance I got out of it while it was overclocked. From 2.1Ghz to 4.0Ghz it kept around 30 degrees idling and around 50-65 under full load. Overall, very pleased with my purchase and I'd recommend it to anyone for a solid, novice, APU build :)
B0030V0PEW|5.0|Here is a common sense application of an idea that is so simple but so important. Being a pilot I took checklists for granted as a natural way to do the business of safety in flight. The application of the checklist is so fundamental in other areas of life it is overlooked and even shunned as adolescent. Atul Gawande's book is an excellent resource for success in business and life. Read it, apply it, it will make a difference.
B009R659L8|2.0|This is the first Mary Higgins Clark book I've read and will likely be the last. Perhaps I was expecting too much, for some reason in my head I thought perhaps she took up the torch of Agatha Christie. I couldn't have been more wrong. There were multiple things I didn't like about the book.<br />1. The most obvious is that there was no main protagonist. There wasn't an investigator uncovering most of the information, putting clues together. It felt more like a narrative of things that just happened to a bunch of different people. I didn't feel like there was anyone that I could really relate to anyone that I could really root for.<br />2. I'm sorry if this offends, but I feel like she just doesn't know how to write men's thoughts. From the bad guys down to the sickly sweet good guys, it felt like she was writing women's characters and thoughts and just happened to label the gender as a man. I never felt like she understood or portrayed how most men think, act, or feel.<br />3. I'm not great at figuring things out, but a pet peeve of mine is when there is a simple explanation for something in the book and yet nobody ever seems to think of it. I did figure this one out before the end, but I'm also talking about other little events and occurrences throughout that have possible explanations that nobody can seem to grasp or vocalize. I don't want to give away spoilers, and it's not crucial to the story, but it's just annoying.<br />4. The dialogue is just awkward. It feels like what people say is highly crafted so that the reader gets summaries and information. It doesn't feel natural at all. Perhaps it was the audiobook reader but at one point somebody makes a phone call and speaks a paragraph to the answerer just to explain why they were calling. But this was done without any hint or intimation that the person was rambling.<br /><br />Perhaps if she were known as an author of suspense and mystery never entered into the equation I would have had different expectations. Maybe I would have been less disappointed. But don't read this looking for a turn-key mystery and a protagonist like a Miss Marple or Poirot.Maybe I would have been less disappointed.

B0063M22QO|5.0|Fairly easy to do. May take a little time to master it, but it's a lot of fun and a great time waster.
B00BEIYM42|4.0|Unfinished Song is filled with a predictable and emotionally manipulative material, handled with such grace and dignity by the cast and director that I was constantly surprised by the film's ability to move me. Utilizing music and melodrama in such a way that is never overwrought or exaggerated for effect, Unfinished Song is mild entertainment which creeps up on you in profoundly unexpected ways. Even the supporting characters feel very natural, making it very difficult to notice when anyone is \\"acting.\\"      Terence Stamp heads up the cast as Arthur, a cranky old man who has become accustomed to his habits and routines with the only person he opens up to, his wife (Vanessa Redgrave). When cancer threatens to take that foundation from Arthur, she suddenly joins an elderly singing group. Arthur is pulled into the group, finding solace in the friendship of the group's young teacher, Elizabeth (Gemma Arterton). Unfinished Song is a film about grief, but manages to keep a light touch on the material.      The music in Unfinished Song is simple but effective, never appearing too polished or unbelievable. There is more heart than talent in the voices, but that works wonders for the sincerity of the film's story. We are not meant to be blown away by the vocal abilities, but instead get swept up in the openness with which they sing their song.    FOR MORE REVIEWS VISIT [...]    [...]

B0087ITBPC|4.0|This was a fun, cute movie. Mothers with sons will like this movie. I enjoyed it very much and could see my son and myself in this movie.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Seriously the best mouse I've ever used, it feels way higher quality than razr's deathadder, especially because the weights, also the color changing LED on the emblem is awesome. The 8k makes it even better, for the price you can't skip it unless you're getting some insane steelseries.
B00002SSKI|4.0|I remember watching this movie with my son when he was little. I had to order it for my nieces and nephews. It's a cute movie.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|this is an amazing CD, definitely one of my favorite Muse CDs. If you like Muse, this has some of their most iconic songs, such as newborn and plug in baby
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|This move was ok. I'm a fan of the Jack Reacher novels and a course...the books are always better than the movies.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|This was my favorite Muse CD for a long time. It might be more suited for pop listeners (I was pretty mainstream until i discovered Muse and followed them into the realm of alternative rock). There are a lot of great songs on this though, especially Resistance and Undisclosed Desires.
B0017GERLE|5.0|I received the DVD set promptly and in great condition.  I have always like the Karate Kid. Worth the buy!!!
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I don't love this CD as much as the other Muse Cds, but it has supermassive black hole, which is definitely my favorite muse song of all time.
B00B3L3RPA|1.0|Not very suspenseful ... I would not read it again... it was boring and dull and not my style of book
B000CDINOK|3.0|This is a good festival but the sound and the picture quality is not too high. I bought the DVD to try to get better quality than youtube, but it seems to be pretty close.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Love this movie, not much else I can say. I just like it. I hope that they make more sequels. I will go a see it.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A brief history of time... Perhaps this is a lighter different version!<br /><br />Great read to pass the time and gain perspective and insight!
B00D8HNR5W|5.0|Only bought this album because  master musician lindsey buckingham was on it.  In addition to his 3 songs, the rest of the album is surprisingly great as well.  Not one bad song on it.  It is musical candy for the ears, must be listened to with headphones for max effect (trust me on this)!!!
B000YJ85BI|5.0|These books are amazing and well written. I couldn't put this book down! Mr. Scalzi does a fantastic job with his characters.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a very fun game the horses are so realistic and they have some beautiful horses to choose from on here. if your as much of a horse love as I am this game is for you!! enjoy!
B0040I09RM|4.0|Appears to be well written and a true to life crime drama. The story unfolds with a young man struggling to find balance in his life as a new father and his membership in a motorcycle club.  Watching additional episodes will expose how true-to-life the series will remain.
0060899190|4.0|I love PostSecret....Its a book filled with them. That's all that really needs to be said about this book other than you may want to just get them from your library unless you find a secret in there that really speaks to you or you want to give it away to someone else.
B00F91H15W|1.0|Seriously just watch the trailer of this movie and you get the point of the entire thing. Everything else in between is just filler. Lots of pointless filler.
B00005QENZ|5.0|A jamming, outstanding record full of continuous hits! This album will get you moving. I am sure that all Aerosmith fans and casual Aerosmith fans will love this album.
B006UN3MRO|4.0|A delightful, and very English tale about a rather unusual bear.  I Recommend it for primary school age children. A classic.
B000I8HIR2|5.0|The whole theme of this movie was great.  The actors did a wonderful job and the two female leads were outstanding in creating the fear and unexpected scenes to make this movie an unforgettable adventure into another level of fear and intrigue. I highly recommend it.
B008RKGF1I|5.0|A Great motivational story! The actress is gorgeous! Dance moves are hot!. A must watch for fans of these types.
B000VWYNOG|5.0|Brings back memories of both Jim and Van singing together at the Whiskey back in the late 60's.  Did you know that??  Not many do or have ever heard of it ever happening.  The days of the &#34;Whisky, The Longdon Fog and Hollywood Bowl are gone, but, the music will live forever. Anyway, since I have ALL of the DOORS music, I needed to add Van to recreate a meaningful past even if it's in my own mind.  Thanks Load Amazon!!
1440503257|5.0|I liked the tasty recipes, and the story line included was nice. My family and I just love Harry Potter.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|This book started out really slowly but built with the dimensions of the journey of Harold Fry. It was a reminder of the fragility of all of us when it comes to relationships and our perceptions of where we fit into them.  I will recommend this book to friends.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Very pleased with this movie! Does not need the gory scenes that most have for shock effect! Very well acted! The feel was like watching a very good, older type movie, where the acting carried it's weight! Tommy Lee Jones was outstanding! Great movie about prejudice from the past and an ending to a 40 year old cold case! Highly recommend!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I had difficulty getting started with the book but once it all started coming together I found I couldn't put it down. I didn't like being able to accurately predict what the secret was but really enjoyed the last excerpt about different scenarios that could have happened.
B00DT55OGS|5.0|It's amazing how a CD can change your mood for better. From track 1 until the end, the songs are awesome! Love Belle Sebastian!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was really excited about this product, because I want Youtube on my TV, mostly. My Roku doesn't have Youtube.<br /><br />Unfortunately the product doesn't work, at all. It fails on setup, not just from a Win7 PC but from an Android phone as well. It proceeds through setup initially, but then it bizarrely KILLS MY NETWORK. My wireless network disappears and never comes back. If I reset my network, it comes back, but as soon as the Chromecast sees it again, it tries to update again, and the network disappears once more.<br /><br />Worse than a product that doesn't work right is a COMPLETELY HOPELESS support experience. I have called the phone support number twice, and both times got a nice young agent who knew nothing about the product except how to reset it (tried six times) and couldn't refer me to anyone else. I was told \\"a technician will get back to you in 24-48 hours\\". It's been 96. Same experience with email support: useless instructions to make sure the power is on, and \\"24-48 hours\\". But no one ever gets back to me.<br /><br />I'm sure it's something to do with the device not getting along with my wireless router, but their (lengthy) list of router workarounds doesn't include mine.<br /><br />No one seems to be interested in talking to me about it. So, you know what? Screw you. I sent it back. I'm off to get an Apple TV, which is probably what I should have bought in the first place instead of this piece of junk or the Roku (which at least works right off the bat, even if it doesn't have the content I want).
140006922X|5.0|Zealot: the Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth reads like a novel. I gave this book five stars because  it is informative and tries to get at the truth about a belief that affect minds of much of mankind. I recommend this book to all who question what they have been taught to believe from childhood, but who would seriously want to get at the truth.
B0081336FO|5.0|Love it!  So far I am loving season 2.  Good to see some great shots of the countryside in Baskerville.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun way to kill some time.  The game is easy to play. I would highly recommend it. Give it a try.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved the way the plots wove together and produced a very intricate tapestry. Excellent from the beginning to the end!
B00ECUARO8|3.0|I thought it was an interesting movie but not one I'd watch again. It entertained me for the evening hours
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Thank you for telling us what happened to Doc...the continued unity between the child who was and the man he became are 100% spot on. The kiss through his fingers made me have to take a minute to collect myself. Great book.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is amazing!! Easy to read with no nonsense language and easy to follow experiments to put you back into being the manifester of your reality :) highly recommend it to all!!!
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|It is wonderful having the original Star Trek series in Blu-ray.  The quality of the discs and the picture is excellent.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|It is a hidden object game with a fun story and puzzles to solve a mystery.. The graphics are really good and realistic, and pretty.
B000IKAHN2|1.0|This show is not good. The characters are terrible to the point where it is painful watching them interact with each other. The acting isn't very good either. Your time would be better spent finding another higher quality show to watch. If you are interested in the story line, I suggest reading the episode summaries online and saving yourself the frustration of watching this.
0385536828|5.0|Reading along, reading along, reading...I'm thinking, \\"I love Ian McEwan, love the way he bends my sense of 'normal,' love the quiddity, the it-ness, of the worlds he discovers and fills in. I believe his characters...I know a few of them (but not the seriously sick ones...)...\\" and so on. Here, as I knew a few things about Serena's clandestine world, the cultural Cold War backstory, and the factual basis behind Sweet Tooth, this novel hummed along toward a 4-star review, with the intelligency parts credible and surprisingly well done (hats off here to McEwan: authorial interlopers aren't often able to line things up as well he succeeds in doing - his sources are all sensible, the human beings who were part of his research gave him good answers to the right questions, and all that material has been processed through a first-rate story-teller's quirky mind) and the other bits pleasingly, quietly, humanly compelling.<br /><br />So in this setting, I liked Serena and all her insecurities (as I generally marvel at a male author who can write convincing women: our greatest American contemporary, Philip Roth, was tested by just this, and generally failed, to his last published page), and I thought Tom an interestingly drawn \\"angry young man\\" of the post-Kingsley Amis school, with his own plausible peculiarities - loved the Martin Amis walk-on (with a little kicker - and NO, that's not a spoiler: there are spoilers aplenty in this commentary thread) - love the early McEwan-esque characters (Jeremy, with his comical bone deformity - if you can imagine such a thing - and Tony, the Cambridge don with his own unusual history - but Cambridge being THAT Cambridge, and this being THIS type of novel...), and although I thought the Security Service authority figures straight out of central casting and fairly cardboard, well, that's pretty much how they'd be if you didn't know their fascinating histories (and \\"fascinating\\" they invariably would be, to include hair-raising stories like the one related near the end of the novel, about the dead officer who washes up in 1943 with a briefcase...).<br /><br />So reading reading reading humming humming humming along...to the last twenty or pages that, in my view, bumped this entirely enjoyable novel of (minor) intelligence and literary intrigue (a combination, by the way, in which I thoroughly delight) up another entire star. Damn! Needless to say, I can relate none of content of this, not even a hint, not a single adjective - although I'd love to write, indeed, did write, two adjectives, that, on reflection, I feared might tip a reader's anticipation in one direction or another...so I deleted.<br /><br />To know that something is bound to happen, that a McEwan novel is a ticking time bomb, BOOM!, is something every one of his readers already know and every one of his prospective readers should learn before they enter his world. Yes, I do have a gripe about the way he treats news-media reportorial standards that is central to the way the narrative unfolds and is, to me, the only truly misleadingly manipulative segment of the narrative, and it would have cost the book a star, had it not been for...ke the one related near the end of the novel, about the dead officer who washes up in 1943 with a briefcase...).<br /><br />So reading reading reading humming humming humming along...to the last twenty or pages that, in my view, bumped this entirely enjoyable novel of (minor) intelligence and literary intrigue (a combination, by the way, in which I thoroughly delight) up another entire star.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved this book so much, I went out and purchased all of his other books.  The book is wonderfully written in the voice of a young terminal cancer patient.  The author dances wonderfully around this sensitive subject by employing humor with just the right touch of feeling and emotions.

0345525558|5.0|Highly recommended, this is one of my favorite novels read this year. If you liked The Secret Life of Bees, then The Language of Flowers will likely appeal to you.<br /><br />The Language of Flowers is a remarkable coming-of-age story about Victoria, a young girl tossed around in the foster care system. She struggles, for understandable reasons, with attachment issues to people, and lashes out in relationships, eventually deeming herself within the system as \\"unplaceable.\\" Given one last chance by her social worker, at the age of ten, Victoria is placed with kindly Elizabeth, who tries to crack the hard shell of Victoria.<br /><br />Elizabeth also introduces Victoria to the Language of Flowers, a metaphoric language of plants and flowers used in the Victorian Era when someone wanted to convey a secret message through the type of flower given. Each plant or flower has an emotive key word, which was hoped to be expressed in the gift of the flower. While Victoria finds she does not trust being in the presence of people, she finds a great, natural comfort and connectedness around plants and flowers and this weaves into the core of her life and her very being.<br /><br />At first, the story may confuse the reader as parts don't add up, but soon it becomes apparent that we are looking at two parallel stories in Victoria's young life and the novel toggles between the two time lines: one at age 10, when Victoria is placed with Elizabeth, and the other at age 18, when Victoria ages out of the foster care system and finds herself on her own and must learn to survive. The way the author weaves these two timelines together becomes important to the way the story unfolds, like the slow bloom of an unraveling bud of rose petals. It becomes a brilliant weave, and I found myself reaching out for more as one timeline paused in order to allow the other to unfold for a moment.<br /><br />Victoria's mistrust of people is only surpassed by her mistrust of herself. The depths of her self-loathing are something Victoria confronts throughout the novel. Victoria's slow character development through the challenges she faces is a powerful experience, and I found myself wanting to either cheer her on and give her a maternal push, or to scream, \\"NO! Don't do it, Victoria!\\" Watching her find her way is much like each of us tries to do as we wander the mazes of our own lives, though many of us are more fortunate than Victoria, who has little to build on.<br /><br />Without giving spoilers (the storyline goes far beyond what I've shared here), Victoria's story is realistic and heart-warming, and gives testimony to the power of love, and how differently people can see the world based on life experiences. The decisions we make, the trust we build, the relationships we form, are all unique expressions of our personal history. How Victoria attempts to understand and control her world may be a powerful metaphor for many in how trust is woven into our psyche.<br /><br />For parents, there is some sex in the book, an integral and necessary part of the story.<br /><br />I enjoyed the Audible version of this story, and it was very well done. The female narrator adeptly captured Victoria's sass and youth, while adopting the variety of personalities of people around Victoria very well. I didn't want it to end.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I had lost interest in King novels about the time \\"The Regulators\\" came out....and didn't pick up another one until his recent 11/23/63, and I so enjoyed that book that I didn't hesitate to purchase this one.  Doctor Sleep had a bit of a shaky start for me-- There is some of that \\"old\\" King writing here, a bit of camp mixed with cliched scares--The kind that I'd grown a bit tired of.  I guess as you get older, it gets more and more difficult to creep you out.  --But about a third of the way into the book, the story just builds and builds with such masterful suspense, that it becomes impossible to put it down.  I read the bulk of it in a day, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  If I could have given it 4.5 stars, I would have-- because of that shaky start, but in this case I'd rather err on more stars than less, because I don't care what you think of the writing style, if you finish the bulk of a book in a day, it's a keeper.  Give it a go, you'll be glad you did.

B00CL0J99K|3.0|Note: Plot Spoilers.<br /><br />There were so many plot misses in this film, I'm not even sure where to begin. Let's start with Iron Patriot. Rhodey was never the Iron Patriot. Instead, the real origin is that Norman Osborne takes control of the War Machine suit from the government and paints it to be the Iron Patriot (at first to be a villain, then later redeems himself as a good guy). Ignoring the film's poorly rewritten origin, the Iron Patriot was absolutely unnecessary to the plot. It added nothing. If Rhodey had been wearing his War Machine suit, the plot would have been identical. It was simply added as a merchandising tactic. How many 'War Machine' toys can you sell? Parents probably aren't even happy by this name. However, the 'Iron Patriot' is a much more uplifting name from a merchandising perspective. Of course, they even point this naming piece out using dialog within the film. I digress.<br /><br />This film completely lost its way nearly throughout. Abduction of the president of the US? Seriously? The vice president is compromised because of his daughter's (plot convenient) missing limb? How much suspension of disbelief are we expected to put forth here? I rolled my eyes as soon as I saw the vice president's role.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it seemed this movie's sole goal was to show us Tony Stark out the Iron Man suit more than in it. If I go to an Iron Man film, I expect to see Iron Man doing Iron Manly things actually IN the Iron Man suit. Not Tony Stark galavanting about in t-shirts and jeans. I also don't expect to see robotic remote control Iron Men all doing random things. Again, it's about Iron Man, not some robotic IronFest.<br /><br />While the actors put forth their level best to reprise their roles, and did so quite well, the plot was just so far off the mark not even the best acting could reel in this story disaster. Yes, it even concluded with fairly cliche  and convenient happy ending, but what it took to get there wasn't really worth the time and effort. And worse, it shows Tony having his shrapnel finally removed. If it were that easy to have had it removed, why didn't that happen at the end of the first film? If it were that easy, why was the electromagnet even necessary?<br /><br />Overall, the Iron Man series should have ended with Iron Man 2. This one probably should have gone direct to DVD.<br /><br />SFX: 5 Stars<br />Plot: 1 Star<br />Acting: 4 Stars<br />Overall: 2.5 Stars (rounded to 3 as I can't give 2.5 on Amazon)<br />Recommendation: If you must, then rent or stream.he time and effort.

B008Y212PI|4.0|A fun game but it needs to be a little harder.  Hope they add some more puzzles with larger sizes.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this book.  I think all females should read it....young and old.  Links the way things were to the way things are now and back again.  Two strong women at different stages of their lives.  It was a little difficult reading at the beginning. Jumping from current to the past but it finally made sense.  It left me wanting to read more about this \\"Orphan Train\\".  Didn't even know it existed.
B00EAH3GHI|4.0|I only give this 4 stars because I went through the songs on the list of this page and I see that several of the songs are repeated alternate versions of the same songs and this is a big distractor and detractor for me when I go to buy music, I don't understand why you need several different versions of the same songs.
B002G39JME|5.0|Like many, I've read The Day of the Jackal and saw the original movie adaptation numerous times.  Rereading it conjures up a mental image of the movie scenes and characters enhancing my entertainment experience.  Knowing the outcome distracted little from experiencing the intrigue.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it! It was everything I could have hoped for and more. I can't wait for the next book! Spectacular!
B0011EU0NG|5.0|My 2 year old has watched this over and over and dances around in the living when any song comes on.  One of my all time fav's.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|The movie is well done. Keira and Matthew have chemistry on screen which makes the story believable. It is now my favorite movie!
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|If you want a realistic and quality reproduction of Heisenburg (the alter ego of Walter White), then you will be happy with this one.From the hat, to the sack of cash to the bag of \\"blue\\", it is a realistic and finely made figure. I would recommend  this to any Breaking Bad fan.

I am reading lists in the language of the best english prose with<br />rhymes and rhythms I have not heard since my last great novel read...this book is an adventure inviting us all to join,
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|This is easily one of the best figures I have ever seen, the sculpting, articulation, and paint apps are second to none. It is well worth the price. Now I don't really recommend it for children because there are delicate parts that could easily be broken in careless hands, but for someone who is careful there should be no issues...

1476727651|4.0|It's not often you can read an entire Stephen King novel in one day.  Well, it's not often that I can.  CARRIE, CYCLE OF THE WEREWOLF, BLAZE, BLOCKADE BILLY...I think these are the only ones I've ever managed it with, and with the exception of BLAZE, they're very short novels.  King's sequel to THE SHINING, DOCTOR SLEEP, is 528 pages and if I'd taken the time I could easily have read the entire thing in one day.  I know this because when I woke up yesterday, I was at the halfway point, and by lunchtime I had finished the novel.<br /><br />It's a very fast read, and the prose just flies by.  That's a plus.<br /><br />The story deals with the aftermath of THE SHINING and what happened to Dan Torrance in the Overlook Hotel.  Starting with events a mere few years later, we speed through the next twenty years of Dan's life with the first third of the novel, seeing him become a hopeless drifter and alcoholic before coming to the town of Frazier, New Hampshire where he meets a man who puts in touch with a sponsor and introduces him to AA.  Dan cleans up and gets his life in order again and, ten years later, meets a girl who has been making her presence known to him over the course of those ten years.<br /><br />Abra Stone is a 12-year-old girl who grey up in the next town over, and her shine is so much more powerful than Dan's.  Seeing the effect her powers have had on her parents, as she gets older, Abra makes them think she's lost the abilities of her youth--abilities that include making every spoon in the kitchen hover near the ceiling at her birthday party, and predicting the events of September 11 while still a baby--so when Abra has a vision of a boy being tortured and murdered one day, she says nothing to her parents.<br /><br />Dan, however, gets a message on his blackboard telling him \\"they're killing the baseball boy.\\"  This means nothing to Dan, but he's been getting cryptic messages like this for years, and he knows the sender is named Abra, but he doesn't knowanything else.  For the past several years now, Dan has been working in a hospice in Frazier, earning a reputation as \\"Dr. Sleep\\" because of his knack with helping the dying patients go to sleep, easing their passing.  He keeps a blackboard in his room with the names of all the \\"guests\\" written on it, but every so often, the mysterious Abra leaves him messages there.<br /><br />More time passes and we're finally in 2013 when Abra just happens to catch a glimpse of the \\"baseball boy\\" on a missing persons sheet.  She can't go to her parents; they think her abilities are gone.  But she feels a responsibility to at least give the boy's parents some closure.  So she tries to find him, but instead stumbles upon his murderer.  And his murderer, in turn, stumbles upon Abra.<br /><br />The boy's killers are known as the True Knot, and they're a band a roving gypsy-like characters who travel the country in campers and RVs, seeking out children with the shine so they can feed off their psychic energy, which they first purify by torturing their victims.  And now Rose the Hat, the leader of the True Knot, has discovered Abra Stone, a girl with the strongest shine she's ever come across.  She sets the True Knots sights on Abra, so Abra calls on the only person she can think of who might be able to help her; Dan Torrance.<br /><br />I'm of two minds about DOCTOR SLEEP.  On the one hand, I think it works as a fun, exciting, well-written novel.  The characters stand out, Dan is a likable hero, and the situation, while far from the most original, is still interesting enough to hold your attention.  Plus it just goes by so fast.  I mean 264 pages in one morning?<br /><br />On the other hand, this book is marketed as a sequel to THE SHINING, but I say this with much conviction: the book is NOT on par with THE SHINING.<br /><br />THE SHINING was a close, claustrophobic and intense novel about the breakdown of the family unit under the weight of alcohol abuse, with a parade of very creepy ghosts on the side.  DOCTOR SLEEP is...not.<br /><br />THE SHINING was a highly plausible situation (barring the psychic gifts of Danny Torrance and the ghosts haunting the Overlook).  You could take away the paranormal aspects and still find the horror in this novel.  Jack Torrance is a recovering alcoholic with anger management issues, trapped in an isolated location with his family for an entire winter.  Before the days of AA and the internet, it was very easy to see how someone with his problems, in that situation, could crack.<br /><br />But if you take away the paranormal aspects of DOCTOR SLEEP, you've got Dan grows up and gets clean, the end.  Maybe it seems like it should be a little thing, but to me it's huge, and to me this entire premise rests on the readers ability to believe in the supernatural.  Not just the supernatural, but the True Knot.  Not just the possibility of something so mundane and everyday as \\"ghosts\\", but now we've got psychic vampires.  It just feels like such a huge leap away from the plausible and into the \\"sure thing, dude.\\"<br /><br />Also, there was a twist about 2/3 through the book, the connection between Dan and Abra revealed that nearly ruined it for me because it was wholly unnecessary and felt like something King threw in there because he thought it was clever.  It wasn't.<br /><br />Then there's the \\"action hero\\" aspect of the story (along with several King staples I`m getting really tired of, which I`ll get to).  Back to THE SHINING for a moment.  There was action in that story, and terror, but the situation had us so confined and alone, it forced us to focus on the events through the characters eyes, living the horror with them.  DOCTOR SLEEP reaches a point in the story where now we've got Dan in a shootout, cars crashing through buildings, body swapping psychics, tranquilizer guns.  Dan has gone from recovering alcoholic working in a hospice in New Hampshire to clever action hero and, for me, it just doesn't work, andit changes the tone of the book.  And in changing the tone of this book, it then casts new, unwelcome, light on the world of THE SHINING in general.  They may be set in the same world and follow the progression of one character, but we're dealing with two totally different types of book here.  The whole tone of DOCTOR SLEEP is completely different.  And, no, not one word of DOCTOR SLEEP is frightening.<br /><br />Back to those King staples.  When you examine King's bibliography, it's easy to notice a few recurring patterns.  He has a ton of main characters who are children (FIRESTARTER,CUJO, \\"The Body\\", CYCLE OF THE WEREWOLF, THE TALISMAN, IT, THE EYES OF THE DRAGON, THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON, HEARTS IN ATLANTIS) and many of these kids express some amount of psychic ability (let's not forget the precognitive dreams of Ellie Creed in PET SEMATARY), so I think having yet another psychic kid as the co-main protagonist is just tiresome at this point.<br /><br />But even more than the psychic kids, even more than King's attempts at reliving and imagining a more satisfying childhood than he had, it's no secret to anyone who has read a good deal of his fiction, he's still working through some serious daddy issues.  And it's no surprise; his father reportedly walked out on the family when King was very young, never to be seen again.<br /><br />And many many many of his main characters have this elderly gentleman father figure they befriend during the course of the novel, stretching all the way back to his second published novel, `SALEM'S LOT when Ben Mears teams up with Matt Burke.  And it's a theme he repeats over and over (THE DEAD ZONE, PET SEMATARY, all the way up to CELL, DUMA KEY, 11/22/63 and the most recent JOYLAND--which also featured a psychic kid).  Except in the case of DOCTOR SLEEP, Dan has THREE father figures.  There's Billy, the groundskeeper and first person he meets in Frazier, Casey Kingsley, his first boss in Frazier and his AA sponsor, and there'sJohn Dalton, Abra's doctor and one of Dan's fellow AA members.  Look, we do what the story demands in order to tell it the way it needs to be told, but when the same ideas and character types keep popping up in novel after novel after novel, it gets boring, it gets predictable, and, honestly, it gets annoying.<br /><br />But at the end of the day, the important thing is does DOCTOR SLEEP work?  As a novel, as its own entity, yes, it works.  The suspension of disbelief may extend only so far and certain parts of this story may be lacking in that department, but it is a fun read, it is a FAST read, and it's engaging and entertaining.  As a sequel to what is arguably one of the best horror novels of the last century?  Not so much.  And maybe that's okay, because, let's be honest, how many people are even going to re-read THE SHINING in preparation for this one?  I sure didn't.  And I still enjoyed it.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I was addicted to the charachters wanting more! When is the next book coming out?
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I'm not a vampire enthusiast by any means, but I grew up watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer. When that show came to an end, a little piece of me died along with it. Since I'm all grown up now (I'm thirty years old), I figured I've outgrown teen series.  And honestly, I didn't think there'd be any vampire show as good as Buffy. I was wrong. The Vampire Diaries is as good and engrossing as Buffy. I'm still chastising myself over why I haven't watched this show when it first aired. On the flip side, I now can watch them all back to back without having to wait on pins and needles for the next episode.<br /><br />Even though The Vampire Diaries is targeted for young adults, it appeals to women over the age of 30. Unlike the O.C and other teen shows, the characters in this show are mature. It isn't anything like Twilight, where the protagonist (Bella) is a pathetic weakling.  Elena (played by the beautiful Nina Dobrev) is strong, vulnerable, and likable. Unlike Bella, her self-worth isn't tied to her beau. She has a good head on her shoulders. Her best friend, Bonnie, is equally endearing.<br /><br /> In the pilot, Stefan, a 163 year-old vampire becomes romantically interested in Elena, a seventeen-year-old mortal.  Likewise, Elena becomes interested in Stefan. *minor spoilers ahead* Truth be told, I wanted to see what the writers will come up with once Elena found out that Stefan is a vampire.*end of spoilers*  Initially, I thought that the storyline was plain obvious and linear. Again, I was wrong. The Vampire Diaries is multi-layered and has a lot of twists and turns. As the layers unfold, you're thrust deeper and deeper into the mystery surrounding Mystic Falls.<br /><br />Damon is a character you'd love to hate (played by the gorgeous Ian Smolderhalder whom I've grown to love his baby-blues on Lost). He is malevolent and selfish, yet has a tender side. I loved the history of Stefan and Damon and their love triangle with the enigmatic Katherine. I loved the backdrop ofMystic Falls and its rich history. The Vampire Diaries is fast-paced, intriguing, and addictive!<br /><br />With all the hoopla and vampire craze created by Twilight, you might probably dismiss The Vampire Diaries as another Twilight spin-off. It is not. This series has great acting, intelligent dialog, and a mesmerizing story with more twists than a corkscrew. You'll be caught under its spell from the first episode. I gotta warn you: this series will make you extremely anti-social because you won't be able to stop watching it. So clear your calendar. Don't say I didn't warn you.
B004ZJZQJC|5.0|Wonderful movies that brings back so many memories of when it first came out and we enjoyed it with our kids.
B003HV0TN2|5.0|First book I have obsessively read from cover to cover for a long time.  Starts off a little slow, but then grips and doesn't let go.  The science and explanations behind the system of 'magic' is intriguing and unique, as are the characters and locales in the book, though with enough reflection in our world to make quick connections in the readers mind.  Lots of hints and subtle suggestions for more perceptive readers, or to make re-reads fascinating as new ideas, concepts and carefully planted seeds are discovered.  Most of all the prose is almost poetic in the flowing and easily read style, and a true joy for the reader to immerse themselves in.  This book was a wonderful, wonderful discovery.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I give it four stars only for one reason-there were some very slow parts. I love the idea of her searching for Ky, but I didn't really enjoy the part when just her and Indie were in the canyon, searching for Ky. I enjoyed the intense parts, but I felt that the story wasn't intense enough. I love the feel of the story. I wish Xander was more in the story though. I would recommend this book to people who would like a futuristic/dystopian love story.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This product connected to my network but would not connect to the internet!  Turns out the chromecast has to be within 20 feet of the router or it will not work.  Because my wireless laptop had no problem connecting from the same location, I was very disappointed.
B00ET0PZDO|1.0|Only wish it had more levels. It was fun and challenging but I would have been happier if it lasted longer than a few hours
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I love this book and I can't wait to read the next one that continues. I love action,mysterious books so this really made me want to read more books like this so you guys should get this book and the series of other books that continue it
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I try to read every new book from Nicholas Sparks - His style of writing is very appealing to me.
B00AAZOKS8|1.0|I thought my grandkids would love the book on the kindle as much as the real thing.  NOPE.  The book is so much better.  This makes me wonder if any picture books are worth buying on my kindle.
B006C3Q6GG|1.0|I had previously read this book in paperback and enjoyed it immensely - five stars worth.  If you are looking for non-stop action in a steampunk setting, this is not the book for you.  If you enjoy character development (these are the most realistic characters I have ever encountered!) and a story that really brings you to the time and place you are reading about (and yes, that means you have to have authentic terms and language) then you will love this book.<br /><br />Having said that, don't get the Kindle edition until they have solved the problems of accidental abridgement.  I am in chapter 7 and have already noticed at least three big sections missing.  One of my favorite scenes, the trepanning of the gunner's mate by Stephen is completely missing.  I went back and re-read the chapter twice, thinking I had nodded off and missed it, but it just is not there.<br /><br />In two other places, just before and during the attack on the small harbor on the Spanish coast, the scene changes completely in mid-sentence without any warning and material I remember from reading the paperback is gone.  There may be other less-obvious omissions I have missed since I am not reading to find errors.  Maybe some people have a hard time understanding the book, at least in the kindle edition, because much of the material is missing!<br /><br />Since I don't notice anyone else mentioning this problem, I have to think that I am the first one reviewing the Kindle edition, or that many people are having such a hard time with the language that they don't notice the continuity problems.<br /><br />So five stars for the book, but buy a hard copy - who knows how long it will be before the Kindle edition is fixed.<br /><br />It's really aggravating that Kindle editions so often do not live up to the same proofreading criteria as print books.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Howey deserves the accolades flowing for Wool - it is the first piece of fresh and innovative SciFi I have read in a long while.  From the first chapters, I was captivated by the concepts, and the work has literally changed the way I view the world.<br />Do yourself a favour and escape into this world.
1416972242|5.0|It's perfect! Just looks like you bought it from a store lol love the brand newness...Very affordable and worth the buy!
B00D8HNR5W|5.0|I only had previously had 'with teeth' on cd that was actually a gift and I liked it ok.  I almost didn't buy this one because I heard the first song and thought it sounded just like all his other stuff.  then I sampled all the songs when it was released and it really grows on you.  I love it.  his music is showing his continued maturity as an artist.  I would highly recommend it to any NIN fan.  I listen to it a lot.  all of it is awesome...
1908571055|5.0|I could hardly put it down it was so interesting and heartwarming.  It is a quick read and the fact that it is true made it very engrossing.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I couldn't put the book down, it was exciting and had so many heart felt sweet and smirking moments. I will read it again and again.thank you for being such a brilliant author.
B00819ER0Q|4.0|We enjoyed it. A good way to spend an evening at home. It was rather improbable, but we didn't really care.
B004LR5K0I|5.0|There are a few songs on this box set I don't recall hearing before..... I'm ashamed to say!  Elvis' voice sounds so rich and beautiful on every single track.  I love this era of his singing.  His voice is so beautiful and rich and these songs really showcase it nicely.  I hear heartache and loss in many of these songs, but instead of it being depressing....they are so powerful on so many levels.  I love this box set because it has SO MANY songs on it and each one is FANTASTICALLY done by the King. I can put it on and listen for hours.... I'm so glad I got this and I would highly recommend to all Elvis fans.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a great game. I can't wait to see more challenging games with harder levels. And yes, I CAN ESCAPE. (0:

B00B52FDXQ|4.0|Spartacus was an excellent series and they did this one well. However, this was not one of my favorite seasons but the ended the series with class.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Great, fun, and exciting. Great performance from all cast. I would go watch a magic show like the ones in the movie.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This movie was made right and paid homage to the original series.  The one word that comes to mind is Satisfying!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I've always enjoyed working jigsaw puzzles but space to leave puzzles while working them is a problem. I love Magic Jigsaw Puzzles and even though I have only had it a few<br />days I am addicted. Try it, you will love it. It's easy to use and you can take it with you.
0375831002|4.0|The Book Thief is a great story, this book is very hard to put down! i would defently recommend it.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I love this app 100 percent it works really good fyi this is the greatest app I've seen yet that's why I gave it a five star
B002NWXRYY|5.0|Goldie Hawn is priceless in this movie.  The plot wouldn't work without her.  Love the movie and all the pretenses.
B00CEJ2H6K|4.0|Another good Amon Amarth album, if you've heard any of their last 4 albums you'll know what to expect. Deceiver is a little more in the vein of Twilight Of The Thunder God though.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|My wife and I just returned from Bavaria and a visit to the various locations where the \\"Sound of Music\\" was filmed including the Abbey, Mirabell Gardens, the Alps and the Lake House, etc.  In fact we have always wanted to make this trip as a result of having seen the Sound of Music many years ago.  Well everything was just as we saw it in the film, and the narrative section of the DVD explained some location changes that were necessary.  We also visited and have pictures of the Gold Room where everyone is seen dancing . . . and the Von Trapps are seen having dinner.  Austria is as beautiful today as it was in the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is so cool so buy it and check it put to update it evrry mounth you do not have to up date it i am 8 and i love this app so get it its free thank you for your time
B009GEDP26|5.0|I couldn't make up my mind whether not I should buy this but I am so happy I did. It is absolutely great and I loved every episode!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The book is amazing, I read it when it first came out and  now I have it on my phone. If your only intro is the completely unrelated film, read the book and get a real dose of awesome.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I use this alarm clock when I travel.  The clock is very depenable and I also can view the local weather.<br />Great App.<br />Bill S.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|Easy to use.  Excellent articles.  Great layout.  Overall one of the best apps I use.  Especially like the simple linkages between related articles.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I found this game a little whacked out. Couldn't go very far. Seemed to get locked up or something. There should be some clues you can go to. I gave up on it after several times trying to get out of like the 3rd room
B004NELBPC|3.0|Content is excellent, but app frequently crashes, especially during video playback.  Overall I like the diversity of content and the way the app is set up.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It's a little mystery + love stories + deceit + fate all rolled up into a book! A nice and light vacation book.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I received the product as promised.<br />I gave it a 4 stars because Chromecast has room to grow and does not have the capabilities I would like to see.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Once again the team have excelled themselves, I believe that Diva and Tony are getting a bit closer together, which should prove to be quite interesting.  I was surprised with the ending of the Series.  Once again looking forward to seeing Season Eleven
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I could not put this one down. A very fulfilling ending with plenty of suspense. A great read and I was sad when it was over.
B00915G6SU|5.0|I have always enjoyed watching the team in action throughout the previous Seven Series.  I was a bit disappointed that the team had to loose one of it's members.  Looking forward to Season Nine
1936891026|5.0|This book was recommended by Joe Rogan on his Podcast Joe Rogan Experience (it was not a paid advertisment, but he had read it and loved it also), and I was very happy to get it. I was in a bit of a slump in life, and this book made me realize that that slump is nothing but a speed bump and the funniest way to get over them is by hauling ass and getting some air. This book was great, and it has a permanent spot by my bed now.
B009B4ZEKM|4.0|Lotus is far from jaw-dropping success-worthy, but maybe that's what works best about it.<br /><br />We hear some anger in &#34;Army of Me&#34; on a power anthem in the same vein as Kelly Clarkson's &#34;Stronger,&#34; or Christina's own &#34;Fighter.&#34; Then she does a 180 on the Dance-Pop of &#34;Red Hot Kind of Love,&#34; when she actually seems to be having real flirty fun. Another song with the same lighthearted feel is the feisty &#34;Circles&#34; displaying a true piss-off attitude with enough punk to call it &#34;Dirrty.&#34; On the bonus tracks, the even-more-fun &#34;Shut Up&#34; gets the job done with a choral background and bleeps to edit the obscenities. Normally, this censorship might ruin a song, but it just adds to the fun here. The heart-wrenching country-rock ballad &#34;Just a Fool&#34; is about a couple unable to let go of a relationship in ruins, knowing their effort to hold on is wrong. It's the album's highlight.<br /><br />Lotus is the kind of low-key collection that's welcome from a mainstream pop artist.
B00846REIS|4.0|Lets start off with yes I did read FSOG and I did like that series. That series was the soul purpose of me picking up this series and giving it a try. Some people love it, some people hate it. Some say this book was better, others say it wasn't. For me they tied. They had their strong points, they had their weak points, and both left me wanting more and sad that book was done.<br /><br />Eva has a horrid past, a stalker mother, a stepfather that indulges her mother way to much, a father way across the country, a new job within the Crossfire building, and a new start to the next chapter in her life.<br /><br />Then she meets Gideon. Young sexy, to perfect looking, playboy billionaire. Tortured and haunted by his own past, Gideon is more than the perfect face. Yes there are similarities to the overbearing possessive, fact gathering any way the man feels similarities, but completely different stories.<br /><br />We truly do not know exactly what Gideon has faced and more than likely will soon, but mixed with Eva's past make to broken people meet and share some explosive moments.<br /><br />Again I'm a sucker for the tortured just need the right woman to save him guy that is still dominant, strong, and in control. DO not form an opinion based on other peoples thoughts. I feel as strongly in like with this book as I did any of the FSOG series. Pick it up and read it.
1878424114|5.0|I start applying the  info from the author. Amd it has made a great impact for the good towards my everyday life..its a must read.rereading it now.
0307743659|5.0|I've been a fan of Stephen King's stories via television miniseries since I was a kid but I never picked up one of his books before. I was struck with the desire to finally read a horror novel and this one definitely did not disappoint. I think for anyone who has seen the Kubrick film you must read this book. It is way better and the characters are more complex. You can really see the transformation of these characters and how Jack slowly is taken over by the hotel.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great, easy, convenient for portable daily study. Study to show thyself approved ......a workman that needed not to be ashamed.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|I love Jane Austen.  This is one fine story in the whole delayed romance genre.  There are plenty of people who wouldn't appreciate the fine characters, but I have loved this story after I saw the masterpiece theater version of it.  The printed story is just so much better because you also get more texture of the time through her phrasig.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It use to work perfect on my kindle fire but now it's saying it's taking too long and I should try again, even when I try again it doesn't work. I deleted it numerous types and nothing has changed. Please please fix this problem, I'm probably missing important messages right now.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Awesome Star Trek movie. Great special effects. 3D blu ray BETTER than in the theater.  A must for star trekkers !!
B008KOTNVA|5.0|The set is very good quality.<br /><br />I used this to take apart an Xbox 360 controller. I also used it to remove the screws off a macbook pro to add some ram.<br /><br />I would like to see the set maybe come with a pouch but the plastic case works fine as is.<br /><br />I did read that some people had issues with the rubber grip on the handle spinning ( black rubber O-ring around tip, used to grip). But mine works fine and did not spin on me though I had to apply some torque to get the screws off.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Very unexpected twist to this one.  LOVED IT!!!  Definitely expect a sequel to this one.  Tom and Morgan just AWESOME!!!
B00D48BSBA|5.0|Vintage Forsyth. Detailed, fast, complex, vivid, colorful, technically sound, and well written. Could not put it down until I had finished it completely. Another excellent book by the great author.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Not really a &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; fan, but this was AWESOME!!!  LOVED IT!!!  I can't wait for the sequel!!
B008220BLG|3.0|Somewhere in the post-apocalypse world, a zombie boy (Nicholas Hoult), who only remembers himself as \\"R,\\" falls in love with a girl named Julie (Teresa Palmer). The romantic comedy with this outlandish premise is directed by Jonathan Levine of \\"50/50\\" fame. Though his curiously sweet \\"zombie-meets-girl\\" romance begins promisingly with effective offbeat humor, the film itself ends up with something more conventional than it should be.<br /><br />Based on an Isaac Marion book, the story starts with a flesh-eating undead \\"R\\" who remembers nothing about himself. He thinks he shouldn't be doing what he is doing, but cannot change himself until one day, during the combat with humans, R falls in love with a girl Julie and saves her. Things get complicated when he learns that Julie is a daughter of Grigio (John Malkovich), leader of a zombie-hunting vigilante group.<br /><br />The \\"Romeo and Juliet\\"-like story (with a parody of the balcony scene) is told from the perspective of R, a zombie who seems to have some low-key sense of humor. The film is based on a concept that is stretched beyond its limits. Some of the processes R and other zombies go through are not explained. John Malkovich is wasted in an underwritten role. The players did great jobs, with a memorable support by Rob Corddry as R's friend M, but CG effects of some zombies need more improvements.<br /><br />\\"Warm Bodies\\" starts out as a unique blend of rom-com and zombie genres, but by the time the film reached the third act it starts to feel padded.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|The DVD was very good quality!  We have watched it twice already, never get tired of this movie.  I particularly enjoy watching &#34;special features&#34; and this edition had a great mini-documentary on Alvin C. York.  There was also a special on Gary Cooper, his life and movie career.  Very pleased with our purchase!  Thumbs up!
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|I don't think I'll do much plot summarizing as it's already been done, done well and done repeatedly, so instead I'll just write about how much I enjoyed it and why.<br /><br />Disclosure: I have a young child with severe disabilities (though not on the Spectrum of Autistic Disorders, not even close) and I volunteer as a (children's) Special Needs Advocate, so I come across *a lot* of kiddos with Autism / Asperger's and, understandably, have an affection for them. My brain does NOT work that way as I have thin skin (am sensitive and maybe too empathic) and am \\"neurotypical\\" in the truest sense of that descriptive.<br /><br />That being said, I adored this book. I adored the story, and I adored how Don Tillman, our storyteller, is a near-forty year-old professor with (most likely) high-functioning Asperger's, trying to figure out how to have an intimate human connection with a woman (I don't mean \\"intimate\\" in the sexual sense of the word, but in terms of a committed relationship). While it appears Don doesn't even realize he is on the Spectrum, his psychologist friends, Gene and Claudia, seem to, and quite early in the book Claudia pretty blatantly posits that to Don.<br /><br />I have a few friends who believe their husbands are of the Don Tillman camp, meaning professionally successful men (most are engineers) who are \\"off,\\" without a diagnosis of Asperger's but clearly, that's what is going on. Listening to my girlfriends rail about their husbands' insensitivities, their armchair ASD diagnoses make sense, as do Don's story and bumblings.<br /><br />Because Don is fictional (which helps a lot!) and super high-functioning, he is aware of his difficulties reading / understanding social cues and he is actively working on that. He is still pretty tight, so when Rosie enters his life he is able to work on some of his behaviors for her and understand that with her he is having the time of his life, but he is still immutable in and with his Wife Project (as in, not allowing that even though Rosie doesn't fit it, the fault lies with the Wife Project, not with Rosie).<br /><br />There's a lid for every pot, and with help from his friends and his own inquisitive nature, Don is able to make behavioral adaptations which enable him to feel happiness and make Rosie feel happy.<br /><br />MILD SPOILERS:<br /><br />Some of the reviewers seem to be put off by the ending (going to Disneyland) but I thought it made sense: Don is emotionally stunted and to his mindset, \\"fixing it\\" by going to Disneyland seems like a natural \\"solution.\\" Some also couldn't understand how Rosie could be still angry after twenty years about the broken promise from her father (of taking her to Disneyland). Well, if you haven't had a major trauma as a young child then a) I'm thrilled for you and b) then of course you wouldn't understand how something \\"trivial\\" like a broken promise could take on such huge import. Her mother had just died in a tragic auto accident; pre-puberty / puberty is already an awkward time for girls, trying to figure out their place in the social pecking order, and for Rosie to have lost her female connection and then have something which made her special (in an envious way vice a pitiable one) taken away could end up having deep-rooted repercussions. Of course, since Rosie and her story are made up this is pure conjecture with a few dashes of projection.<br /><br />It's funny, because the bulk of reading I do is on my Kindle and I (like a few others) am noisy about the poor spelling / grammar / editing we are too-often finding there (as lots of them are self-published). I expect books published by a big publishing house (as The Rosie Project is) to be error free but guess what? It's not! My \\"favorite\\" was the use of \\"principal\\" for \\"principle,\\" which is a no-brainer, really. Guess we're all human ....<br /><br />I loved reading it and stayed up w-a-y too late to finish it -- I was really taken with the story, and I'm so pleased I read it. I'dabsolutely recommend it.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book. Filled with hours of suspense and action packed scenes. Definitely a recommendation! Absolutely in love with the book!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game a lot. It's like having a real horse! I really love the competitions.<br />The animation is really realistic, too.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Enjoyable little app lots of fun to while away the hours enjoyed trying to guess what the shape was going to become would recommend
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Solutions to humanity's shortcomings and problems lie in this book. We must continue to open up your minds, broaden our horizons and spread the word!
B00B8BR1YS|5.0|Everything about it seemed so real. A 'young' Shakespeare his new love. Dame Judith Dench as Queen Elizabeth all the characters were adept at their roles. The costumes and setting were spot on.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Great acting, complex plot, terrific series.  Have just the finale to go and I am savoring  it!  Well worth the purchase.
B003Z2LAAO|3.0|The environmentalists are trying to scare us into thinking we are running out of water by using the Grand Canyon as a backdrop. The title should have been &#34;The Colorado River at Risk&#34;.  I was disappointed that there was not much scenery of the Grand Canyon sights at all, which is what the title alludes you to think.  Robert Redford, come on back and make another 3D movie about the Grand Canyon, only lets actually show the Grand Canyon this time.  I live in Arizona and visit the Grand Canyon often.  People need to see this first hand, but a 3D movie would help spread the word.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The reintroduction of Doctor Who to an entire new generation! Great storylines, wonderful cast. Chris Eccleston and Billie Piper have great chemistry.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Loved the story. In my top 5 King novels. Except for the Soap Opera way the connection between Dan and Abra was dropped. Love the connection, just not the delivery. All else was phenomenal.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Engaging story and characters.  The hope to be able to open to love shines through as a theme.  Don't know how realistic, but
B009PNQUXO|1.0|I normally download crafting video tutorials but was not able to with this app.  I could not loacate where the crafting videos where  nor sign in with my youtube account to get my subscriptions.  I found it now user friendly.  Uninstalled it righ away.  Youtube Downloader much better.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Although it gets a little-over-the-top toward the end (which seems to be the norm in action films these days), the film stays true to the franchise.  The main characters are well defined with (I believe) accurate references to the original TV series.  It's helpful, but not required, that you know the players--from more than 40 years ago!  Definitely worth watching, and can be watched repeatedly because the film is just --- fun.
B00867HDTA|5.0|I downloaded this and it is a fun quick entertainment but my hubby whose a soccer fan loves it. He put it on his Samsung and plays all the time.
B009PMEEY2|1.0|Just downloaded it but i was very disappointed. I couldn't even play it. Started the first level and kept crashing. Couldnt play pass it because it would just restart.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I was not able to download a thing.from youtube.  I download crafting tutorial videos, but could not get it to work.  Could not even find my videos.  Not user friendly for me.
0812993357|3.0|Written as a series of well-illustrated articles, the book reflects Grace's background as a fashion editor. She says it's ironic that since she's read only two books in her lifetime that she is writing a book, but she has overseen thousands, if not millions, of pages like these.<br /><br />The description of her childhood pulled me in. You can feel the stateliness of beautiful of the inn her parents ran and the changes in lifestyle brought on by a full house in the summer and the emptiness of winter.  There is plenty for a lonely girl to explore in the woods and the bay. Grace attends a strict Catholic school. She speaks of her shyness around the other girls.  With her family as members of the Church of England, she is an outsider.<br /><br />While Grace's parents ran this picturesque inn, they would never own it. By primogeniture it was inherited by Grace's mother's brother, and when he died it went to another brother.  In this regard, Grace is much like Pamela Churchill Harriman in coming from a family where resources went through the male line with no thought to the future of the daughters, and the view that a high school was sufficient education. Grace, like Pamela a generation before, made her way in the world.<br /><br />Grace is to be credited for her achievement despite the odds and competition. She writes as though her career just fell into place.  I don't mind the understatement, but there is no reflection on the competitive environment or the hard work, patience and savvy it had to have required for success.<br /><br />The narrative, for me, never reached the level of the prose used to describe her childhood. There were some good topics but they were often punctuated with names I didn't know and descriptions of what Grace and others wore.  I'd love to know more about minimalist housekeeping with the first husband, or how one starts a restaurant which he seems to do so easily.  The insight in to the fashion sense of Russia and China at the dawn of their opening to the west were absent from the description of the on site fashion shoots. There was not enough on how the magazines were run or how pages and stories were and are selected and put together.<br /><br />At the end, Grace touches on aging and beauty, but nowhere does she approach any discussion on the requirements for models in today's fashion industry. The photos she presents show the generational changes in the female fashion image with no explanation. Her awareness of this change seems to be limited to nostalgia for glamor of the 50's and 60's. She writes of the falsity of plastic surgery but nothing on why fashion editors continue to promote unrealistic youth and body images or the decisions and pressures she faced in making artistic choices that either led or followed the trends.<br /><br />I was not surprised nor disappointed that Grace did not \\"dish\\". The parts on Anna Wintour were appropriate and descriptive enough so that you understood her presence and leadership in Vogue and what their relationship was and is.<br /><br />As a very creative magazine editor, Grace knows how to make a page look good. Her line drawings make the book. She is also generous with color photos of her life and work.<br /><br />Because of what it lacks, this is a 2 star book. For its honesty (however limited in scope) and the importance (in the fashion industry) of the person it comes from I give it 3 stars.ening to the west were absent from the description of the on site fashion shoots.

B007ZXK08C|3.0|Spoiler Alert:<br />Begining was intriguing. I couldn't put it down. Very disappointed with the way it ended. Is there a sequel?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game ever super addictive. Bonus FREE!!!!!!! Really fun must get. Can not set down. Please get it is super fun. Trying to get 20 words.
B00AL6SM0S|5.0|There are some stunning performances in this box. I was familiar with the fusion of the Walkure broadcasts of Feb19th and March 30th 1941 done by Richard Caniell on Immortal Performances. The recording in this box allows us to hear Majorie Lawrence as Siegliende instead of Lotte Lehmann, Julius Huehn rather than Schorr as Wotan. Marjorie Lawrence has a big dramatic voice and she makes less of the words but she is still excellent. Huehn has a beautiful voice which I am told was underpowered in the theatre. Schorr is a great Wotan but by 1941 his voice is in decline. I enjoy the Caniell fusion more but it also is wonderful to have this broadcast. The sound is a very acceptable mono.  Flagstad and Melchior are both amazing. If you want additional documentation of why Melchior and Flagstad were so wonderful listen to bands 9-13 Act III of Siegfried. The music is incredible and they can sing the roles with power to spare and great beauty.<br />I am looking forward to listening to the other recordings particularly the 1938 Tristan. The 1936/37 Covent Garden and the 1941 Met Tristans with Melchior and Flagstad have always been high on my list of favorite Wagner. The 1938 is supposed to be incredible.  I would have rather the Met and Sony had included the 1941 Tannhauser with Melchior, Flagstad as Elizabeth, Janssen as Wolfram, and Thorborg as Venus. For Lohengrin the 1940 broadcast with Melchior and Rethberg is a historic and beautiful performance.<br />The Metropolitan and Sony deserve many thanks for this box. It documents great music with wonderful performances and singers. The cost is very affordable.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King brought back Dan perfectly. Hats off to you Stephen. I can't wait until your next project. Waiting for it.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Did you ever wonder what happened to little Danny Torrance and his mom Wendy after Dick Hallorann took them down the mountain when the Overlook Hotel blew up? Oops. Spoiler if you haven't read The Shining. Sorry. But seriously, if you haven't read it, go read it right now. Then come back.<br /><br />Anyway, so did Stephen King. Wonder, that is. And some 30+ years later, he wrote it down.<br /><br />Wendy raised Danny on her own; she never remarried. Danny never lost his \\"shine\\", but he learned to control it for the most part, or at least tamp it down with liquor. Eventually Danny became Dan, and eventually Dan became an alcoholic, like his dad, Jack. Except, unlike Jack, Dan made it into recovery, still with a shine, which he learned to use to ease the passing of the terminally ill in his place of employ.<br /><br />All through Dan's sobriety, though, he keeps catching glimpses of a young girl in his head, a young girl named Abra with a powerful shine of her own. He and Abra both become aware that someone was hunting her, stalking her, waiting for that shine of hers to reach its peak so it could be harvested. Abra was food.<br /><br />Those stalking young Abra called themselves The True Knot, or just the True. Disguised as aging RVers, they roam the highways and campgrounds of the United States, using their own shining to search for children just like Abra: those with a shine or, as the True call it, \\"steam,\\" using the psychic energy generated by the torture and murder of these young people to extend their lives. Sooner or later, they're going to find Abra. But not if Dan and Abra find them first.<br /><br />King drags us on the journey through Dan's alcoholism, down to his bottom, and back up to his recovery. It's an ugly and occasionally stomach-churning story, but those of us who've been there need only hold up a mirror to see ourselves in Dan's shoes. And when Abra enters the picture, we bite our nails while we cheer for both of them in their struggle against the True.<br /><br />As for the inevitable comparison to its predecessor, in many ways The Shining may be the superior novel in terms of sheer scariness: that was the first novel I ever read that frightened the teenaged me so badly I threw the book across my darkened bedroom and went running into the living room where the rest of my family was gathered. Damn those topiary animals! But Doctor Sleep holds its own in the quality of its story, the development of its characters, all done, of course, in King's incomparable style. A worthy successor, indeed, and another winner for the master of modern horror.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This is a great game. Beautiful graphics, wonderful controls, and a very steady difficulty curve. I play it all of the time. Highly recommended!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This novel is an extremely well constructed story about believable people in the future living in an unusual closed environment, the origin of which is a puzzle that is only gradually (and satisfyingly) explained as the story progresses.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book is amazing it kept me glued to it the whole time. I loved it and will be reading the sequels
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great puzzle, connect the same-colored dots with &#34;pipes&#34; without crossing or leaving any square in the grid empty.  When you solve a puzzle it rewards you with a gurgling sound.  Looks simple at first, but gets more complex fast by adding colors and grid squares.  The most obvious or direct route is not always the solution.  You can undo any or all attempts, but the game counts number of moves it took you to finish.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is a book which keeps the reader guessing until the end.  I rank it at the same level as Presumed Innocent.  It is a classic courtroom mystery with devious human interaction resulting in a surprising conclusion.  But is it truly the end?
B00867HDTA|4.0|Nice game action with many different levels to play.  Especially like metal rounds and different skill levels for each game.
B00E72OKAS|5.0|buy it worth they money fun for kids and adults awesome controls and nice graphics buy now one of the best games on amazon
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I'm a girl who farts and proudly announces that it stinky and sniffing my own farts.smells like rotton eggs and cabbage
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I love this game a lot. works really gold. but the moose hunting level is difficult. When I put three or more fingers on the screen. doesn't work
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Great story with alot of truths, a true page turner kept me awake many nights reading until I finally finished.
B00499QUK2|5.0|VERY entertaining series and I definitely can't wait for more. You can tell they really thought out every detail and just seeing Benedict Cumberbatch is awesome in itself (MAN can he act!).<br /><br />Sherlock is truly depicted as a logical genius and while you can dig into it and determine it to be unrealistic if you're one of those nit-picky individuals this show is absolutely outstanding and very worthy of a standing ovation and anticipation for every minute to follow :)
1932378251|5.0|This book is exactly what I was looking for. It helped me decide on a name for my new business.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This is a very highly rated series.  It really is great!  But it is very long, so be prepared for many hours of reading.
B000J10EQU|5.0|very entertaining, needed to replace our old copy, it is very enjoyable, recommend it to every one that enjoys supermanmovies
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest because I can pin anything and everything!! I love to follow people and pin stuff!!! I hope every body loves Pinterest because I do!!!!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was awesome! Very well written, has some very intense parts in it, some of it felt like I was watching a horror movie when you know something is about to happen. Really excited for Hollow City!
B00FJU1HLC|3.0|It was funny and heartwarming, but predictable like every other movie of this genre that has been released in the 2000s.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Can't wait for next season DVD, give us more, more, more, more, now, now, now. It's an awesume tv series.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I couldn't put it down! Such a great story. I defiantly recommend this book. I can't wait for the next book!!
0920668372|5.0|The book arrived a day early and in perfect condition. This book is so adorable. My Mom read it to me when I was little and I ordered a copy to read to my son. I cried the first time through. I hope one day my son will be able to share it with his children.
B000P12LWY|1.0|This video has a logo on the cover--CC within a conversational balloon--advertising it as closed captioned for the hearing impaired.  It also has gold letters to the same effect on its setup menu.  However, cycling through the various items on the setup menu skips over those gold letters, making it impossible to turn the captioning on.<br />Fast-forwarding through the video engages the coding in the synch bars from time to time, so that every now and then a caption is displayed.  The original production crew did install those captions at some considerable time and expense, which is now vitiated because the disk manufacturer did not include a simple software switch to turn it on.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|A nice short read. Interesting enough to keep your attention and Sanderson does a good job of making you care about the characters in the short time it takes you to read this book.

B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I want to thank the developers of this absolutely beautiful, peaceful, charming game. I spent two leisurly, magical autumn afternoons with this game and it was everything I hoped it would be. My only cautionary note would be that the &quot;hint&quot; system is really more of a &quot;solution&quot; system, so use it wisely or the game will be over too soon. Have fun meeting the frog, the owl and the squirrel. They were most helpful! If you're lucky enough to have a family, enjoy this with them. MJG.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Fun fun fun fun, game game game game. Was free for me worth some money if you like game. Hate writing review. The quick brown Fox jumped over the lazy dog.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|This is the collection I've been waiting for!  So many memories, now in HD!  Plays just like the original one, which is sweet!
B00BQ4NLC8|5.0|Hard to describe - it weaves together so well, you think you know where it's going, then find you don't. Heat-breaking in some ways, but satisfying in its inevitability elsewhere. Particularly enjoyed the epilogue, tying up a couple of loose ends in the 'what if...' summary. Glad I spent the money.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Several times I have gone into my Facebook app to be greeted by a blue box that tells me to update my Facebook app but when I click on it, it takes me to the Google play store instead of amazon to update. Is there a newer version then 3.3 or am I up to date? Then how do I get the newer version if there is one?
B007XIC1GI|5.0|A wonderful and amazing read - I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am now looking for something similar to read.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|the free version is ok but the ads sick. I'm going to look for a better one that doesn't have the ads
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Wonderful game I really enjoy it takes my mine away from everyday life keeps you going to see who you can rescue next and look forward to the next time the animals from movie interact .had to restart game do to not being able to upgrade but it upgraded this time.
B000SQMLAS|4.0|$ 390. for a 'real' LP version ? good grief.  have sundazed or someone reproduce it in vinyl. my original version is past worn out. Hey I was a kid way back when ...
B005V1WZ10|5.0|Huge fan of KORN and loved the energy in this album with the intermingles of various artists making this a likable work of art. Davis' voice still reigns and the lyrics still hold substance. I would encourage all fans of good hard hitting music to give this offering a try.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|This is really stupid I only have 15min. To play it people ho made the demo are dum like don't get it ever
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Awesome read. Couldn't put it down. Love this romantic journey in Scotland. Can't wait to read more for Jamie and Claire
B004UAKAE2|1.0|and it's the stairs to the basement..... just not that good....some good acting, but not much else, it's nowhere near downtown. abbey, that's for sure
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|The game itself is fun. But for some reason to play it I have to redownload the game and the aquatic park wont download at all. 5 stars if they would fix those problems
B006BAEQB2|3.0|I liked it because I like philippa Gregory's writing and stories but this one just seems monotonous.  3 more words
0385347774|1.0|The seller did a fine job of delivering the book, just as ordered.  But the novel itself was poorly written and plot was not plausible or the least bit entertaining.  I'm sorry I wasted so much time making my way to the end.  Skip this one, but buy another book from the vendor.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Kept me reading cover to cover. Surprise ending that made me cheer for the bad guys! Cool plot and lovable characters.
B00005JOA0|5.0|I am happy with this purchase - enjoyed the video and the shipping was fast and the item arrived safely and in great condition...I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves English type movies.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|It was not as good as the first film in this reboot of the franchise, but certainly a entertaining couple of hours.  The plot seemed a little thin, but I think they were trying to re-imagine &#34;The Wrath of Khan&#34; without just doing a remake of the original.  The original was a much cleverer Elizabethan revenge tragedy, with Khan as a futuristic Ahab; this time around, Khan was just a standard villain with an axe to grind.  Still, it was reasonably good entertainment and certainly worth four or five bucks on demand.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I am an avid Game Of Thrones fan and had to have the Complete Second Season for my DVD collection!  I was happy with the shipping and packaging of this item as it arrived quickly, safely and in great condition!
0765365278|5.0|Many of us sci fi/fantasy nerds know Brandon Sanderson for his work finishing Robert Jordan's epic Wheel of Time series. The Way of Kings shows us that he is perfectly capable of developing his own storyline filled with highly compelling characters. I do not want to go into the plot because I hate spoilers. I found that I had difficulty putting it down. There were enough surprises to make up for the predictability of a few major plot lines. I cannot wait for the series to continue in March. Pick up this book at your own peril. With the series just beginning, we will likely be hooked for years to come.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I am an avid Game Of Thrones Fan and had to have the Complete First Season for my DVD collection!  I was happy with the shipping and packaging of this item as well as it arrived quickly, safely and in great condition!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Kept me glued to the book the whole time. A little bit of something for everyone. Looking forward to the next.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I read this book because a respected friend said it was good. It seemed to me to be many many short stories about how individuals dealt with the zombies. I felt like I never had the opportunity to develop an understanding of any of the characters, there were so many.
B0015DYIH2|1.0|First off, let me say that I have always hated Bella. What's to like really. She would have more dimension if she was made of cardboard! Throughout the whole series she kept saying that she didn't deserve a friend like Jacob. I guess we were supposed to disagree with her? And the birth seen in this book?! I had to literally put this book down and concentrate very hard on not throwing up. Besides, her having a baby with Edward should have been impossible. If only Mrs. Meyer had followed her own rules.<br /><br />  Things that annoyed me:<br /><br />  1. Of course BELLA had to be gifted. Why can't she actually be imperfect for once instead of just saying she is?<br />  2. There was zero action at the end. Seriously? We waited an entire series to end with intense negotiations? I wanted Rose to die, do something selfless fir once. I wanted Edward to die so SHE (I refuse to say her name) could suffer for eternity. I wanted blood!<br />  3.  Her daughter's name is Reneseme. Vomit. Jacob imprints on Renesme. Vomit once again.<br />  4. SHE gets everything she wanted without giving anything up. She basically says Charlie is on a \\"need to know\\" basis, Rene has Phil and Jacob loves Reneseme now so everything is good. What about her friends?<br />  5. Last one, promise. Did anyone think about what would happen when the Cullens have to move?  Would Jacob just leave his pack? Would they come with him?
1885167776|5.0|The book The One Thing has been a true joy to read.  It isn't just for Real Estate professionals.  This is a book about life and how to make changes effectively, I had so many \\"aha's\\" in this book, I am now on my 3rd time reading it.  Each time I gleam something new!  I have given this book to many of my friends and acquaintances in others businesses and they have felt the same way, even if you don't like to read much, this is one to read and keep on your coffee table, its a great book!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Very fun with. never ending challenges.  Recommend for all ages.  It can be very addictive.  My grandchildren have fun with all the games too.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am in the process of reading this but &#34;Oh Boy&#34; is it good!  I would recommend this to everyone.
B008Y212PI|5.0|With the tutorial the puzzles are easy to understand. The written instructions that are included means you'll be playing in no time. A great app.
B00B2GK4KW|5.0|My daughter is into this type of thing and says that she is very happy with it.  The price is also better than the local retail stores.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was sooo good could not stop reading!!!! Mr grey oooolala I can't wait to read the next two!!
B004I744AS|5.0|The easy of use is very helpful. There hasn't been a word i shouldn't find. I foound this to be a dictionary.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|My daughter bought this from Amazon last year as a Christmas gift for her brother who happens to have a hearing problem. The closed captioning does not work on any of the discs. I was very upset. So if you need closed captioning don't bother buying this set.<br /><br />Here is an update on the review I left a few days ago. A nice person replied to my review, and suggested we try using an analog cable to connect the DVD player to the TV for these particular DVDs. I want to say that it worked and my son can use this DVD set! We are so glad, and thankful.<br /><br />Anita
B001KWTBVQ|3.0|If you like lite drama, tragedy and a classic storyline you might enjoy Drew Barrymore in this version of Cinderella.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|No, ASH is not in this film (but watch all the way through the End Credits for a surprise. This was a Amazon Instant Video rental and was well worth watching. The film turned out to be pure horror all the way and did not let up until the end. Don't go looking for comic moments. You won't  find them. Just pure unadulterated horror. If you like 'real horror' in your movies and not comical scenes tossed around, then you should just go ahead and buy this film instead of renting it. You'll enjoy it again and again and again. Happy Halloween!
B0009A21R6|5.0|The quality of the 5.1 mix is astounding, full immersion in the music from the second the audio starts playing.  Rush is my favorite band, bar none, but this SACD is phenomenal.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Forget this movie. When they have to throw in BRUCE WILLIS to save a mediocre film,  then you should just pass on it. If it wasn 't for him and The Rock, I would have only given it 2 stars. I'm sure there are a lot of 'kids' out there that might like this, but due to the violence, they'd be better off sticking to the 'Joe' cartoons. What a waste of star power and money.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Have been a fan of 2000AD and Judge Dredd since 1985. After the disaster that was the Stallone movie I was sure they would never be able to get this character off the ground again. How surprised I was. Urban is a perfect Dredd and really made this movie! It's a shame this was so overlooked when it was in theaters, but let's hope they make a sequel! The Dark Judges!!
B0000399WC|5.0|LOVE this movie! Gripping, exciting, full of drama. One of the best movies I've owned in awhile. Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman at their best in my opinion. I highly recommend it.
B004EHZPEG|5.0|A very informative read.  Takes a look at gaming from a very drilled down perspective.  Highly recommend for all levels of game designer
B009LDCZDC|4.0|One of the better television shows the past two seasons.  Although I'm not a huge fan of Claire Danes, she has done an awesome job in this series
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books I've read. Recommended to all my friends. Looking forward to reading more books by Colleen Hoover.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is fun but they need to work out some bugs I've had to restart 3 times now . But I'm hooked on it.
0547884591|5.0|My fourth copy. I bought it for me, and then my sons who love to cook. A wonderful book, timeless information..
B000000OU0|5.0|I would recommend this album to any Eagles fan.  It's full of their best stuff.  We used to own a copy years ago and wore it out!  LOL
B003B96AOW|5.0|I got mine today and it is beyond expectations and i cant wait to purchase more items from Marvel select and i cant wait to see what they come up with next.
0061122416|5.0|If you are going to own only one Paulo Coelho book, I would suggest this one.  It's a classic, and I believe it will be around for our great grandkids to enjoy.  A beautiful lesson in spiritual principles tucked into a wonderful story.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Outstanding book! Truly love this period of history. Utterly fascinating to read this spin on events. I could not put this book down.
0553801473|5.0|I was so engaged with this 5th book that I found it difficult to put it down to take care of life's mundane chores and pretty much read it from start to finish with few pauses.  So far, this is my favorite of the series.
B00E9E4EC8|4.0|This album has some sweet music. It's hard for me, as a straight-up Bluegrass fan, to call it straight-up Bluegrass...some songs hit that better than others. But Alan Jackson is one of the best country singers of all time, and of course that country sound is going to come through because it's who he is. He's got some great musicians on it, and they do a great job. I'm enjoying the music very much, so no need to get too picky about a label for it.
140006922X|5.0|Although this is not an easy read, the book is so informative on the history of the early years and development of Christianity.  I found it to be enlightening.
1451626096|5.0|This is a brilliantly told historical novel. The characters are brought to life wonderfully. It is a sad tale, but not without beauty and triumph. The throne of England is not easily won and is hardly retained.<br /><br />I highly recommend this excellent book. You will feel as if you have traveled back in history and witnessed the striving of Royals.
B0012GMVDK|3.0|I love this album.  The songs are some of my favorites.  However, track 7 was a problem.  It skipped in two places, leaving out parts of the song.  Other than that, I love this album but wish I had a fully playable CD.
0694003611|5.0|I believe this is one of the best books you can purchase for a small child. My granddaughter and I loved reading this book together when she was small.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Although there are great action scenes, it was difficult to keep track of what was going on which detracts fromj your ability to enjoy the movie. Also there is too much emotional distance so you dont really feel for the characters. It feels too formulaic and not sincere enough.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|I really enjoyed this book! I didn't want to put it down. I could relate to the characters and it was fun to watch the growth Rose accomplished. Can't wait to read the next one.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It's not very trivial to set it up but once it's up it works great. Google's instruction did not say that when it's first powered on, the Chromecast runs as its own wifi network that I had to change my laptop's wifi to connect to its network SSID in order to set up my home network on the chromecast itself. After it's done then I had to change my laptop back to my home network.
B0055SJVPW|4.0|I enjoyed everything about this movie from the story line to the soundtrack and can't he title is so appropriate.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|This device has 2 ports: Apple and Android. I found out that the Apple port pin 2,3 were not bridged and therefore when charging an Android device, it could only draw 500 mA (ok for a smartphone if it's not running all kind of apps, but most Android tablet won't work as 500 mA is not enough to charge a table). The Android port was fine as pin 2,3 were bridged (connected internally)so an Android smartphone or tablet can draw for up to 2A.<br />I wish the description can be more clear or I wouldn't order it.<br /><br />Updated 10/18/2013:  After I posted the original review, Anker customer service contacted me immediately and helped me to get a refund. I applauded them. They are truly responsive providing a great service to their customer.  I procascinated for a week due to other committments and then I bought a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 to replace the Galaxy S2. I tried the Anker again and to my surprise, the Note 2 could draw 2A from both ports that the S2 couldn't.  I went online google it and true enough, the new Samsung is smart enough to draw the Apple port at full 2A required by the new Galaxy. So now I'm happy and I won't return it. This charger is high quality. The build is rock solid comparing to another flimsy one I bought.  It's highly recommended.
6302508878|4.0|Delivery was quick and in tact.  I ordered it for my sister's Christmas gift.  I also ordered King Kong Lives.  She still uses her VCR player and it is hard to find the older movies that she enjoys in VCR mode.  Thanks.
B003VW54QO|5.0|This is one of my favorite John Wayne movie I would strongly recommend it for any John Wayne fan, it's great!
B004GYY714|5.0|I was looking for Spark Radio for the ease of use and do not have an Apple product.  I am really happy that is just as good for what I was looking for if not better.  I am still getting used to my Kindle I just received this week.  I do occasionally have some issues but I am not sure if it's me or the program yet.  I like to have easy access to all local stations although sometimes one of the local stations I like isn't in my list while at work and then later at home it is.  I like the way the stations are categorized so far.
B005MSD6QU|5.0|The episode was great and I love criminal minds. It is always suspenseful. I highly recommend watching this amazing show!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I have to agree with the comments already written about the summer update.It is absolutely horrendous compared to the old app. I deleted it and gave a feedback comment the first day I noticed the change. Today, I just checked back to see if it was back to the old app and saw the comments.<br /><br />PUHLEEEZ bring back the old, USEFUL app...<br /><br />--- a fan of the Weather Channel since day one
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Thank goodness it is once again Dream Theater instead of The Jordan Rudess Band. Obviously it is a matter of personal opinion on whether or not you like this cd. My personal opinion is that I love it. Once again, Dream Theater is a guitar driven band instead of driven by keyboards. I am a big fan of the metal side of Dream Theater and there is only so much room for keyboards in metal. John's guitar sound is fantastic on this cd and I love it!! I agree with everything positive everyone had said about this album. The more I listen to it the more I love it. I can't stop listening! I personally don't understand how anyone who has been a fan of Dream Theater from day one could like ADToE (which is overwhelmed by keyboards) better than this album. Oh and by the way, to all you Portnoy fanboys out there, seriously?? I still think Portnoy is an amazing drummer but just listen to this album and that is all you need to know that Mangini is every bit as good if not better. I don't miss the Cookie Monster vocals from Mike either. That does not fit in Dream Theater. If you haven't bought this yet and are still on the fence, please don't let any of the negative reviews keep you from buying this cd! In my personal opinion (and that is all it is), this is one of their best ever!!!
B001O1O71C|5.0|This  book was a suspenseful, unpredictable, and entertaining book that made me want to keep on reading it and reading it. Definitely a great read for anyone that doesn't mind some historical fiction or sadness.
B004LPLU4K|1.0|Kept starting and stalling! We never were able to finish watching! Our connection seemed to be good and we were upset!
B0000UJFCO|5.0|This DVD/CD package of Symphonic YES Live recorded in Copenhagen, Denmark featuring the European Youth Festival Orchestra provides such a fresh and bright compliment to the YES classics as well as the new  material contained within.  Highly deserving of the 5-Star rating I am placing on this recording, and YES is, as always, in their fine form of musicianship and the true virtuosos' that makes YES who they are for over 45 years, and still going strong.  YES Rocks!!!  This is a must have in anyone's collection!<br /><br />I wish to commend Movieshack for their superlative 5-Star care & service.  My order arrived exactly on the date promised.  I will not hesitate to order from Movieshack in the near future, and recommending Movieshack to my family and friends for their outstanding customer care & service!  Thank you!<br /><br />Sincerely yours,<br /><br />ERIC RAPPLEY
B009PMEEY2|2.0|Cliched and confusing.  Did not enjoy, deleted within minutes.  Has nice graphics and horrible gameplay.  Save yourself some time and pass on this one.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|very realistic.  amazing movie, it makes you realize and reinforce the family values and love for your family and others in a time of need.
0345803507|1.0|Horrible. Horrible. Horrible.<br />I read some of the horribly written novels and literatures in my life but this make it to the very top of horrors. The whole story is circled around the physical beauty but immature and over-rated characters, repeated dialogues and stupid plots. I mean how many times those characters have to repeat the same phrases to get their point across? Please.<br /><br />In the real life, this kind of borderline abusive relationship based on the physical and sexual attraction only, will never work. Christian Grey is nothing more than insecure, obsessive, over-grown 5 years old with terrible temper tantrum. Ana is equally obsessed with any women that ever looked at her husband and can't seem to let go of his past without mentioning infamous \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" every 2 seconds. Any time they attempt to talk about any subjects other than sex, they are fighting. Yeah, their marriage will not last too much longer.<br /><br />The epilogue where Ana is pregnant with their second child and after having sex she said \\"I think the baby already likes sex\\" was icing on the already-having-the-bad-taste-in-my-mouth<br />cake and the very last straw. I put the book down and it went straight to the trash can.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book to anyone especially to the avid readers.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's actually pretty awesome I've never seen anything like it and even though you get lots of goals you don't have to do them and you can just make lots of things in your city and you can get actual cash better then real world stuff I t s fun!
B0087GJ8KM|4.0|I've been in sales for ten years, read tons about it, been to countless seminars, and I gotta say, this book is a welcome addition to my library.  anyone keeping up with the game will be familiar with the concepts, but the data sets are interesting and enlightening,  and the tips on implementation are excellent.<br /><br />I'd say everyone, in sales or no, would benefit from reading this.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A tale of struggles and lessons- secrets and forgiveness.<br />A roller coaster - sad at the conflicts, angry at the decisions, hoping the corner will be turned. Nodding in agreeance and shaking my head at the choicees.<br /><br />Not for the message, but for the love of flowers, I recommend this book for my niece Melissa.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|They are so young and clueless what true love really means. I feel sorry for both of them, especially Ana she doesn't know him at all.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Great game! Opportunity for hints to be given and errors can be made with limited tries.  The shapes are difficult to figure out, however the themes are fun.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|this game us perfect, its fun and cool. and it teaches kids to be safe around trains and other stuff
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|Fangirl is a coming-of-age story about a young woman with social anxiety. The book explores going off to college and the changes that come with it, such as boys and issues with her twin sister. I liked this book; I found Cath believable and easy to relate to. I like Levi as well; I've read people criticizing about how &#34;perfect&#34; he is, and I can see where they get that idea, but this is a piece of fiction. I don't mind suspending my belief for something like this, and I can only wish there was a Levi out there for me. I think Cath and Levi had a solid connection in the book. I like Reagan as well - I wish I had her confidence. The book is full of likable characters who feel very real, now that I think about it, and watching Cath interact with them and deal with situations that many college students face (alcohol poisoning, difficult assignments, etc.) was fun and interesting. Though I didn't read this book straight through in one sitting, it was one that was difficult to pull away from and I found myself thinking about it even when I wasn't reading it.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to re-read this book again.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Orphan Train is a sad but triumphant tale of loss, love, and the resilience of the human spirit. This is a great read for anyone who loves historical fiction. I would highly recommend it!
B005LAIIGW|5.0|The movie is great, the most immersive ever.  Spoiler alert for the rest of this review.  From the dream sequence with the return of the experienced pilot character, the physics of the movie get very dream like. The act of getting the escape capsule to within a few meters over 100 kilometers or so of distance with the use of a set of rear facing rockets meant for landing is the sort of thing that makes winning the lottery seem probable.  Also having enough velocity to close the distance, but yet able to attach to the Chinese station with just a hand hold is similarly impossible.  My interpretation of the second half of the movie is that once the dream sequence starts is that the movie may be like the conclusion of the TV series \\"Lost\\". Possibly as much about accepting death with a clear heart and head than a Homeric saga of miracles in life that return the hero home against all odds.
B004DNWPY4|5.0|It was a very interesting book.  It shows by example that the person who seems to have everything probably doesn't.  That rich person in the big house with a lot of toys is probably spending ever penny he has and is drowning in debt.  The guy next door that does not seem to have a lot might just have more savings than the rich guy.  He'll probably be able to retire way sooner than that rich guy too.  The book put a lot of things in perspective for me.
B008Y212PI|4.0|The puzzles are easy at first but they get increasingly more difficult. Great way to pass the time! I really like playing this game.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This movie has everything; love, suspense, good guys, bad guys, and never knowing what is going to happen next.  You really need to see it. To say more would be to give it away.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Love Alicia Keys! All of the songs on this CD are great! Love that she collab with Maxwell . Fire We Make is hot!
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|a great 2nd entry to this series soundtracks--very engaging and like any good soundtrack --emotionally evocative would recommend this without hesitation
B00F35BV64|5.0|It made me go back to watch Space Seed and The Wrath of Khan to &#34;catch up&#34; on the original stories.  I really enjoyed how the movie worked to entertain another plausible meeting between the Khan and the Enterprise crew.
B004QX07G4|5.0|What a great read. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Typically funny as always from Ellen. She never disappoints. I'm such a fan.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|The best re-do of Sherlock to date! Fantastic story telling and the best cast for Sherlock and Watson EVER!! Pure chemistry, great direction, can't wait for season 3!!
B004T4LUPW|4.0|Easy to use and syncs easily with my other calenders.  This was a good FAOTD and I am glad that I grabbed it.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Another Star Trek gem, a must see for real fans and novices alike! JJ Abrams has brought the genre to new heights, pure sci-fi excellence! Great cast, excellent chemistry, and a knock-out story, what more could you want?
159420229X|4.0|I couldn't believe myself reading this book; I am not a fan of math and/or related any math-related subject, but I do enjoy this book!
B004X2M3SI|5.0|Such an amazing time travel show, there's truly none other like it. You never know whats going to happen next but somehow it seems to be all written to come back to the beginning. Even knowing this, you will never guess whats coming next.
B007HJ96NO|5.0|Cinema Paradiso is a film to be cherished and held in the heart. Utterly superb. It's a personal journey of life that touches every chord like a symphony. Among the top 5 all-time favorite films of this 60 year old film buff.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Short complete Bio<br />Interesting tracking of career and life lone<br />ups and downs<br />Utterly the unsung genius of all times
B00EQRMAJW|4.0|Easy to listen to. Soothing. Much like his debut album. Every song is worth listening to over and over again.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Well this game belongs to one of those \\"jewel\\" type games, where you are supposed to match identical items in groups of 3 or more, but it comes with a new twist. Graphics is great and this game is more fun than it has any right to be.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like this game it is simple and love getting all the coin. I recommend it for any one to play and it was free from Amazon app store.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Excellent quality! The streaming was perfect in my laptop! I want more for sure! Something good to have such great choice of video!
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|When LinkIn came on line years ago, I was among the first to join.  Now everyone is there. I can post my resume, I can look at jobs. I can network with people that I know. They have great articles to help you whether you looking for work or you are trying to promote your business.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've always been a King fan, and he's at his best. Gripping from start to finish. Great &#34;sequel&#34; to The Shining.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I don't like that it shows the characters of your password as you enter them. I think this is a big security issue because if someone hacked into your device they could easily record your password then have access to your email. There are so many ways for people to hack into accounts and the last thing we need is to give them an easy way to do it.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|Yet another fantastic addition to the BTN line. I utterly love the figures they have made. Or should I say the Figuarts. Figurine Art.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote as a college student to hold all of my notes in desperate notebooks. This allows me to have a digital copy that I can annotate and access from anywhere. Let alone if I miss a lecture a friend using Evernote can share the notes with me easily. Best note taking app ever. However, I would like to be able to take notes on my kindle fire with a stylus pen using penultimate but that's not for Android platforms yet. Also would be nice to seamlessly be able to use switch to annotate my pdf notes that I have already placed in a notebook.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|A fantastic movie, great story, excellent production, wonderful special effects, great cast and lots of smart humor! Definitely worth watching and owning.
B00915G6MG|4.0|After all these years it keeps performing well... although pushing Cote to a corner. She lost her family and it is unlikely to score with Tony.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This is basically the remake of &#34;Wrath of Khan&#34; but, with a new twist. Again, the new series of Startrek has scored a big hit that is well worth watching and owning. I can't wait for the next motion picture of this new Startrek series.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|When I was a hyperactive and slightly crazed child I learned to read by reading comic books. And yes I'll admit that at first all I did was look at the pictures, but eventually I found myself running in to my parents to try and figure out what exactly Spiderman, The Hulk, The Avengers, and the X-Men were saying. The comic books instilled within me the desire to learn because I found them vastly entertaining and interesting. At the same time as this I was living out in the country and we only had four TV channels, ABC, NBC, CBS, and KTVU Channel 2 out of San Francisco. I know in this age where we have hundreds, upon hundreds of channels to choose from, that its hard to imagine just having four TV channels, but that's what I grew up with. One of my favorite TV Channels outs, of the big four I had to choose from, was the independent KTVU Ch.2 and the reason I liked it more than the others was that on Friday Nights they would have Creature Feature movies, which were hosted by a dude named Bob Wilkins, who had a great sense of humor and always had great intros to the movies he'd play like, Frankenstein, Dracula, the Werewolf, and a whole bunch of other great black and white horror films. I thought these films were just great because they opened me up to the wild world of horror.<br /><br />And then somewhere around the seventh grade I discovered Stephen King and everything changed...<br /><br />Stephen King took the horror that I saw on Creature Features and made it scary. The Stephen King novels were the first full length books that I read for pleasure. At the time I would have told you that it was the subject matter that drew me to the books, but as I look back now, I think it was more the way he told his stories. The Creature Feature Movies and the Comic Books were aimed at a more innocent audience, but the Stephen King books were aimed at scaring the hell out of adults, and as I was reading them, not completely understanding all of what was being said, I was thinkingthat I was being let into the world of adults, like I was pulling back a door and looking into a world I was not yet a part of. Stephen King wrote in such a way that it drew me in and made me a part of that horrific event at the center of each novel and in doing so he personalized it, he humanized the horrible, and that he made you feel each and every action that was perpetrated on his characters.<br /><br />I wasn't alone in feeling like this, because at that time Stephen King was the absolute Rock Star of writing, every single one of his novels was a blockbuster success, and they were all being made into movies, one right after the other. So it's fair to say that what I was feeling as a reader was what other were feeling too. But really when you look at what he was producing at that time, Carrie, Salem's Lot, The Shining, The Dead Zone, Firestarter, Cujo, Christine, and Pet Sematary and you realize it is a succession of great books that tap into some of our deepest fears. I'm not sure which book I started with, but I think it was The Dead Zone. Today I understand politics, and how the wrong person in office can have dire consequences, but at the time I had absolutely no idea what any of that stuff meant, all I knew was that Stephen King made it scary as all hell and totally engrossing to read about. And from that point I was hooked. I went racing through the books as fast as my little mind would allow me to read. I remember it got so bad my mother would take the bulb out of my light at night so I wouldn't stay up reading too late, but I couldn't be thwarted, I got a flashlight and a bunch of batteries and just kept reading. King had that kind of effect on me, I felt compelled to keep turning the pages until I reached the cataclysmic conclusions of his books.<br /><br />And then came The Shining...<br /><br />Of all the books I read by Stephen King The Shining is the one book that made me sleep with a light on at night after I read it because it just terrified me.The Overlook Hotel, the snow, the moving hedge animals outside, the little girls, Room 217,  all combined together in a nightmarish vision that frightened me half to death. I mean they were stuck, miles away from anything and anyone else, in a hotel filled with horrifying things, and that had this strangulating feel to it, like there was no possible way out, and everyone was going to get killed. Of all the books I've ever read that one made one of the deepest impression Ive ever felt.<br /><br />It was hard to top The Shining. The Kubrick Movie left a bad taste. I started college. I moved on to Clive Barker, and I didn't read anything else from Stephen King...<br /><br />And then came Doctor Sleep.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep was the first Stephen King book I've bought since my last year of high school in 1984. It wasn't as good as The Shining, but it was still a pretty damn good book. More than anything, for me, it was like meeting up with a good friend, where you find yourself falling into the same patterns, and memories, and you walk away with a smile on your face because you remember just how much that friend meant to you. Stephen King ushered me from my childhood into the adult world of reading for enjoyment. He taught me that a writer could be a superstar, that his books could be made into a massive succession of movies and TV shows, and that a writer could have a deep influence on a persons life. Doctor Sleep brought me back to those thoughts. It gave me an idea what actually happened to Danny Torrence and his mother. It gave me new creatures to hate and fear. It gave me a new hero to cheer for. King gave me a story I could deeply enjoy like a fine wine that's been aged to perfection and is filled with all of those tastes that remind you of where the grapes were grown, what barrel it was aged in, and the person who made it. The story wasn't deeply original, and borrowed from a lot of sources, but it was very Stephen King and that was greatly satisfying for me.<br /><br />As I begin my own writing career I've had a lot of influences in my life, my parents, Mr. Murphy in high school english, too many movies to name, a whole bunch of books, and Stephen King. I don't think my head would be filled with all the thoughts I have of writing glory if I hadn't started reading that first Stephen King book. If I hadn't watched Stephen king become a household name. If I hadn't read The Shining. As I went through college as an English Lit Major I remember teachers looking down their noses at what they called \\"populist writer\\" like Stephen King as they tried to get me interested in all of the greatest literature, and yes some of those books and plays were very good, but it was very wrong of them to do that. I don't care if it's Stephen King, J.K. Rowling, or Stephanie Meyer, if the books get people excited and make them want to read, then teachers should encourage that and they should embrace it. You never know where the next writer is going to come from or what is going to influence along the way.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep is a very good followup to The Shining. I couldn't recommend it higher. But I make that recommendation with one piece of advice, read The Shining first, and make sure all the lights work in your house, because you might need to keep a few of them on.
125000098X|1.0|Loved book 1, enjoyed book 2, and then somewhat struggled to stay interested in this 3rd book - but I stuck with it because the entire series had been captivating, AND I'd invested so much time. But don't even bother starting this book! (I know you won't heed my warning though - I wouldn't have either, after so thoroughly enjoying the first two books). It's as if Archer slowly became more and more bored with it all. And that ending??? Are you kidding me???  PLEASE donn't waste your time, or if you do, please listen for my quiet &#34;I told you so&#34; in the back of your mind.
B00AEFY08O|5.0|Instantly a classic,Stupid is,as stupid does! See this in blue-ray,very good.This would make a very good gift.Easy to find,priced perfect.No hassles,fast delivery.A must for anyone who likes Tom Hanks movies.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|just got this for my old gen kindle fire and it works great....  there are many levels to play, the level of difficulty graduates in a nice manner that you can make good progress and still feel like you have a lot of game left. furthermore, there is then a survival mode to unlock to keep you coming back for more.  graphics are good and the music and sound effects are decent.  all in all, I applaud amazon for throwing his one at us for FAOTD.  thanks!
B005HEE186|4.0|The original series,this was very cool.Especially in HD.For all Star Trek fans,this is a must see.This particular episode has Kirk& crew against a humanoid with powerful mind control.Check it out,note the 3 demensional chess game.Worth it!
B00EP22QKG|3.0|I'm a longtime fan of Joan Jett's and I do love this album, however some of the music sounds repetitive. Songs like \\"Bad As We Can Be\\" and \\"Make It Back\\" both good songs but sound too much alike. And the violins... not the best touch for a rock 'n' roll icon like Joan Jett. Call me old fashioned but for me, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts have always been about three guitars and drums. Anyway, my favorite tracks on the album are \\"Any Weather\\", \\"Soulmates To Strangers\\", and \\"I Know What I Know\\". Having also listened to the LIVE performances for \\"TMI\\" and \\"Hard To Hold\\", I wasn't to keen about the lyrics and the way Joan sang them on this album. \\"Seriously\\", seriously? I love the tunes, I like the music but this is definitely not Joan's best work. I love ya Joan but better luck next time.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I really love this game;I wish I could get more neighbors with out getting on facebook but I love it
B00COO2D6O|5.0|this game is a great time killer. It is really fun if you like the first toy defense please check this game out
B000025802|2.0|I'm afraid I've been listening to these for years. One of the most disappointing box sets I ever bought. The recorded sound is sterile and unexciting. I can't even critique the performances because it sounds like the microphones were left in a cardboard box during the sessions. I finally got fed up and decided to check out some other recordings. At the moment I'm listening instead to the Szell Cleveland Sony rendition of the 7th and it's everything the Kubelik is not, despite being a recording from 1958. Lush, detailed, nuanced, great brass textures, swelling bass, spacious. Fortunately there is now Google Music etc and you can actually listen to 20 or 30 versions before buying anything. I advise you to do something like that before shelling out for a box set based on the bafflingly glowing reviews this set has.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Movie not drawn out..held my interest from beginning of film to end..great movie to watch, don't have to think too hard to understand, all ages friendly, great twist at end
B005VT42BS|5.0|It's rare to find a network scanning tool that is as fast as this one.  I find it very useful and easy to use.  Congratulations to the developers!
143911000X|5.0|I bought it as a gift for my husband who loves the show. He is loving the book.<br /><br />Side effect: A husband who constantly quotes The Bro Code.<br /><br />I secretly enjoy reading it too. It is super funny.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This book and all the books in the Hunger Games series are well written and entertaining. They are meant for the teen age group, and this shows in the very G rated love triangles. Some of the writing I find to be very unrealistic and read like a Harlequin Romance. That being said, the action and story lines are good. I think the movie was better than the book, looking forward to seeing this on the big screen.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|Great movie and period piece! If you liked Whisper of the Heart, you will love this movie.  It's one of Miyazaki's best written movies.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|These books in the Hunger Games series are well written, although very teen oriented. They are filled with good action and you get a real feel for the characters mental and physical state; some of the stories are very dragged out and unrealistic; this being said, it is an entertaining, although very tame, read.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|very easy to read.  i gave the book to my teenage daughter upon her request.  she is excited to learn!!!
B001AXME2S|5.0|So many good songs!  And at a great price!  Glad I waited for it!  It's an oldie but a goodie!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Clever movie, Steve Carell's amazing!  Funny for young and old, looking forward to watching the next  one when it becomes available on Amazon.
1885167776|5.0|This is an awesome book!  Easy to read and apply to your life.  Whether it's setting priorities for work, home or your spiritual life, this book will assist in helping you understand what's important in life
B008Y212PI|5.0|So Addictive! It's simple yet complex enough to keep you guessing, and coming back for more. It's really hard to put down! Great pastime!

B003DNH6DK|5.0|Great Movie.  Shows human caring, blindness to color all with a touch of humor.  Based on a true story too!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love playing in Minion Beach. I cannot get enough of this game!!!!!!I learned of its existence when I saw my friends playing it and their parents told me it was free so when I got home I got it on my own kindle and I cannot stop playing Minion Rush!
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Love it a lot. Love the difficulty level. I would like to see an update on more of the specialty balls
B008XBCJ34|3.0|The movie is great but there was difficulty with the 3D part that we didn't have with other movies.  Even after we upgraded our Blu-Ray player and did everything we could, it was barely 3D.  We had other movies that worked so much better.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I wasn't sure what this book was going to be about but it turned out to be very interesting. Something so simple as walking can turn into life lessons or memories of family or appreciating those around you. It was easy to read and I enjoyed it.
B008JFUN6E|4.0|This film by the South African director Neil Blomkamp is set in 2154, in an Earth that has become a planet wide slum. The wealthy classes has migrated to a space satellite called Elysium, which looks like a gigantic gated community, who is protected from the invasion of illegal immigrants by the ruthless Jodie Foster. Matt Damon stars as Max, who lives in a completely Mexicanized Los Angeles, and is on his death throes after being exposed to radiation in a factory accident. He wants to infiltrate Elysium in order to cure himself (the residents of Elyisum has cutting edge medical technology able t o cure all ailments which is denied to the inhabitants of the Earth) and to do that he decides to work for a bunch of gangsters. Though the political undertones and the metaphors of the movies are a bit obvious, the film is entertaining and well done. Many critics have interpreted this movie as a left wing screed, but it could be easily seen as a right wing pamphlet, in which the end of civilization is blamed at the uncontrolled influx of immigrants.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a cool but very addictive game. It's not for the weak minded. You gotta have wits to beat this one.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Great story with the action that you would expect from Jack Reacher!  Nice to have a look into the people he worked with in the army and get a little more back story on him.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I recommend this movie to everyone.  You don't have to be a trekkie to like this movie.  I never miss any Star Trek movie or TV show and feel that Chris Pine and the rest of the new crew of the Enterprise are perfect in their roles.  Zakary Quinto and Carl Urban have nailed their roles as Spock and Bones, and all the rest are equally good.  Benedict Cumberbatch was an excellent Kahn, truly bringing that character to life.  Excellent movie on all fronts.
B009PMEEY2|1.0|Way too easy. Music and sound are ok. The idea of various talismans is fun but this is just way too easy.  Lost interest fast.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|My kids loved it. I thought it was pretty funny as well! I would highly recommend it to all families!
B00003CXA6|5.0|Follows the book &#34; The Killer Angels &#34; pretty closely, brings faces to the character's in the book. Enjoyed it even though it is a might long. Thank goodness it is on two disks. A must for anyone who is a Civil War history Buff.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The game is enjoyable to play for and my wife and my children and me. It is agood game to play
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty shades gets better with each book. I wasn't a huge fan of the first book, but the second was better and the third and final book made me a lover of the series and the characters!!
0399255370|5.0|I would recommend it for Kindergarten for parents and teachers to read to the children and talk openly about their feelings.  The children will enjoy reading it to themselves later and let their imaginations soar!
B00BRUQ3PS|2.0|I consider Margaret Atwood to be the world's greatest living author: the creator of true masterpieces such as 'The Blind Assasin', 'The Robber Bride', 'Alias Grace' etc, ... and of course 'Oryx and Crake'. I found 'MaddAddam' significantly less captivating and real than the 'Year of the Flood' (which, during the past 20+ years I have come to expect from Atwood). It had too much of the key failing that made 'The Year of the Flood' a lessor novel then 'Oryx and Crake' - namely the  silly naming of corporations (AnnooYou, RejoiveEsense, etc). Atwood's previous 'speculative fiction' -- her ingenious and accurate categorization of those of her works that others' wrongly label as sci-fi: 'Oryx and Crake', 'the Year of the Flood', 'The Handmaiden's Tail' and, 'The Blind Assasin'-- transcend the genre, and are simply great literature. Sadly 'MaddAddam' did not achieve her previous level of art.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|This was a blast from page one. I had no idea Ian Fleming lived such an exciting, Bond-like life during World War 2. I really enjoyed the 007 references and the twist at the end was cool. Nice job!
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|I have only one problem with the songs on this album, They keep ending. NUF SED<br />Just when I felt done due to age she does this UNBELIEVABLE work. You are never over. Can't get any closer to that truth. Call me
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I don't ' usually do reviews. I can tell you this book was amazing. My daughter who is 30, told me about it and how good it was. It kept my interest from the very beginning and in the end, I sat and just wondered about how life is.<br />All I can say is.....read it. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />Barb--<br />Colorado
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game. Play it on here and my phone. Fun for all ages too. Highly recommend it for those who enjoy temple run.
B00FF03K0M|5.0|I'm telling you what this should win album of the year at the Grammys.  I've seen Elton many times in concert and this is some of the best music he has put out in a long time.  It reminds me of when he first came on the seen in the early 70s his music was fresh and exciting and this album gets back to those roots.  The piano is spectacular which comes out in concerts but sometimes not so much on albums.<br /><br />This is his best work since Peachtree Road.  A must have for Elton fans and a great addition to any music collection.<br /><br />My cat Sammy gives it 4 paws up because it had her sound asleep and purring in no time which is the sign of a great album.  Yes I know I say album its a generational thing most people have never played an album I'm sure.  Again I digress.  Just buy it and get the expanded additional 6 song version for the extra money.  It is money well spent believe me since these songs are some of the best on the album.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|One of my all time favorite books.  I read it over 5 years ago and just reread it so I could refresh my memory before seeing the stage production in London.  Was AWESOME!
0385349947|5.0|great read, great flow, not boring at all!  aA great book for any career person (man or woman ) to read for inspiration!
B00EDPFJA4|2.0|The music sounds like everything that is wrong with hip-hop...overly produced vocals, cliched subject matters, etc. Not a fan at all of this genre of music and it defines what is wrong with music nowadays.
B00ECL7ZJ2|4.0|Melodic.  Quirky.  Sexy.  Harmony-laden.  Catchy.  Intricate.  Fun.  Explosive.  It has been a long time since I heard an album in which every song has something wonderful to offer.  I thought it was well-crafted, packed with hooks and created with a lot of care and enthusiasm.  The sisters think a lot about sound, texture, mood and atmosphere -- perfect for music geeks like me, but they still bring the emotion and the power.  They are bringing intelligence back into pop music and the wait has been long.  Buy this album legally and support this band so that they have the resources to keep making inspired music.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|The movie was released in a letter box format.  It is in HD but with letter box the picture size is reduced.  I would have preferred a full screen on my big screen.<br /><br />I am happy with the shipping time and all other aspects.
B00CTEMOT0|5.0|Savvy writing, great actors and voices that bring down the house.  I love a good Marilyn story - make it a musical? Genius! For me it's some of the best entertainment I've seen on network TV in a long time.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Really enjoyed the book. Several plots but they all come together. I would like to read more books by this author.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I love Stephen King so I enjoyed the book.  I thought it was a little too long with too many sub-plots but the concept was a good one.  Typical Stephen King ending.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|Azkend has Sharp Graphics with many Colorful items in octagonal tiles that you can touch or swipe to Match 3 or more.  The tiles then change to Blue and the selected items disappear and allow items above to drop down.  Object is to turn all octogons Blue and then lower a Unique Talisman from top to bottom until it drops out and you win the level.  Latter levels add more Variables and increased difficulty to keep you Engaged.  Achievements are awarded for selecting larger numbers of tiles with one swipe,  cool Explosions knock out more tiles, etc.  The Sound Effects, Music and Visual Effects are all Pleasant and Enjoyable.<br /><br />Overall, a Fun and Satisfying game that was well thought out and Nicely designed with player in mind.  Gameplay is easy, Timer is forgiving and you can earn more time with good combination plays.  The Storyline is Nice but does not have to be followed to play game properly.  Good Instructions, Options and Controls make it a well Polished App.  Safe Permissions and No Annoyances.  Thankfully, you can play with WiFi off also.  An Enjoyable game with Moderate challenges that make it a definite KEEPER!
B001B71NOI|5.0|I love it. There is not an album that I haven't liked. I definitely recommend it to any NIN fan.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|Hilarious, This is something very different, treat yourself and just get lost in a funny book. This is about the real &#34;Forest Gump&#34; type of character.
B00001W9G0|2.0|I wanted more romance and less left-wing polemic.  One or two good scenes did not justify the length of the movie.<br />Ralph
B0089LOG02|5.0|I, like most people, had never heard of orphan trains until recently.  This is foster care in its earliest version.  While most children did well, some suffered terrible abuse.  Their stories need to be told and soon none will remain to tell them.

B008Y212PI|4.0|This is a nice game to challenge the brain, especially the 15x15 puzzles. The loss of the star for me was for the two buttons, paint or erase, being one next to the other. I inadvertently hit the wrong one and had to start over several times, especially when I was first learning the game, and before I knew I could ignore the errors. Other than that, I had a hard time walking away and wished there were more pictures!
0470913029|2.0|not easy to follow  Would leave me with cravings Some good ideas but not a diet we could follow longtgerm
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Nothing unexpected here.  Brad Pitt is, of course, the hero.  He scrapes through everything by the skin of his teeth.  Very predictable plot and unrealistic.  All the great minds of medicine can't figure out an answer to solve the problem, but 'he' does!  Filled with action.  After all, he's consumed with saving his family.  Brad wanted to make a movie his children would probably like, and he did.  No award nomination here, though.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|First Jack Reacher film I saw and thoroughly enjoyed Tom Cruise in the starring role  Have always enjoyed all the Jack Reacher novels

B00B8M4IMK|5.0|It doesn't fit in the 12V port on my 2002 Civic LX. Technical support had nothing useful to say.<br /><br />I will keep it for a future vehicle since it's so inexpensive.<br /><br />Doug<br /><br />EDIT There was something lodged in the back of the 12V port which allowed my previous adapter to work but not this one. I removed the obstruction and the Anker works marvelously.
B001ILHY2C|5.0|Prison run by a woman stages races that have to be seen to be believed, Statham who always excels in this kind of part is awesome here. He plays an inmate who takes the champions place when he is injured severely.
B00CP4GSGO|5.0|Hans Zimmer. Fantastic as always. May his children's children be blessed with all of the milk, honey, myrrh and lollipops.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I downloaded this app just to warn people with a review: this is NOT the official Google search app (dev is kyy -- who?) This one is a total waste of time when you can just search within your browser or use the built-in Google search app on your phone.  Don't bother. It's completely unnecessary. Also, I can practically guarantee that the positive reviews are all fake. Read them over to see how generic they are -- they give no detail. This app is a total fake made by devs pretending to be Google. Do NOT install. It's not worth your time.
B00CWGLOY6|5.0|Fast paced with great art and imagery. I was very surprised and am off to buy volume 2 right now!

B00DJZR46G|5.0|i've listen to this album many times since it's release.it's a real good album .i don't understand some of these negative reviews.This album isn't MADMAN ,YELLOW BRICK ROAD,and why anyone expects this after all this time is beyond me.Elton is in his 60's why do these people expect him to do what he did in his 20's or 30's .We all grow up perhaps some of these people should grow up too.Anyway back to the album .It starts off with OCEANS AWAY which features just Elton and the piano not the track I would have started off with but nice anyway.OSCAR WILD has a great piano riff in it just as the next track THE BALLAD OF BLIND TOM.TAUPIN has included some very crafty lyrics throughout the whole album.ELTON has some very nice piano on this album more than he has had in many of his later efforts.DREAM 1'2 &3 are all short little pieces that connect some of the tracks together something he hasn't done too often which I think makes the album flow.MY QUICKSAND I'm thinking is about the many demons that him and taupin have lived through.The middle tracks are my favorite CAN'T STAY ALONE TONIGHT,VOYEUR,&HOME AGAIN.CAN'T STAY ALONE has a country feel to it even an I GUESS THATS WHY THEY CALL IT THE BLUES type.VOYEUR reminds me a little of WHERE TO NOW ST.PETER it's catchy poppy would make a good second single probably my favorite track.HOME AGAIN is a nice ballad a really good ELTON song don't really understand why people have said its boring.If you were to take al ist of the hits elton has made half or more are ballads so why now do people trash him.TAKE THIS DIRTY WATER sounds a little soul like it could have been on SLEEPING WITH THE PAST.I have to say there is a lot of different types of music here so again people are branding it boring I don't get why.<br />THE NEW FEVER WALTZ is indeed a waltz nicely done nothing fancy.MEXICAN VACATION is very similar to THE WASTELAND from another great album SONGS FROM THE WEST COAST.The title track THE DIVING BOARD is also a pretty good song about taking chances just as ELTON has always done.THE BONUS TRACKS excluding the live stuff is also pretty darn good CANDLELIT BEDROOM is a bit like something off his more recent albums like CAPTAIN AND THE KID nice song.GAUNGURN GONE HOLLYWOOD is a story about possibly an old lonely artist this and 5TH AVENUE go back to albums like TOO LOW FOR ZERO and BREAKING HEARTS 5TH reminds me of two older songs BURNING BUILDINGS from BREAKING HEARTS and BLUE AVENUE  from SLEEPING WITH THE PAST.One thing in 5TH AVENUE he mentions 1982 which was the first year i saw ELTONat MSG so i connected with it the first time i heard it.This album won't change the world,it,s not the greatest thing he's ever done but in these days where MYLE CYRUS(hannah montanna) isat the top of the charts for an adult contemporary artist thats been around longer than any of these people will be it's a really good album.
B008JFURKG|3.0|I did a post on the sexiest superheroes and choose Henry Cavill (Man of Steel) as my #1; well move over Superman cause here comes Byung-hun Lee who plays Han Cho Bai, a deadly assassin with a conscience, in D.C. Comic's (Retired, Extremely Dangerous) sequel RED 2.    Han is just one of the reasons to revisit this crazy bunch of supposedly inactive CIA Agents: Frank Moses (Bruce Willis), Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) and Victoria  (Helen Mirren) are all back to their old superhuman tricks and schemes carried out with seasoned skill and lots of luck.    This time the movie opens not with Frank being bored with civilian life, instead it's his girlfriend Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) love interest from RED. The two are in COSTCO, Frank's picking up stuff for their BBQ dinner with Sarah absently munching on a jumbo snack bag of something, looking detached and vacant - trademark MLP.  The action picks up quickly as Marvin enters the picture, trying to convince Frank to help him with a mission, Frank's reluctant, Sarah's all too eager. READ MORE- [...]
B00ET47USI|5.0|I like the game and its fun when you are wanting something to do if you are waiting at the dentist or somewhere else.
B0090SI582|3.0|I always look forward to a new Xmen movie - just love mutants and their plight of being misunderstood and feared in this world not yet ready to accept those with special abilities.  Of course, there are a good number of villainous mutants, so the racial profiling isn't completely unwarranted.<br /><br />The thing about me and Xmen movies, well movies in general (which is why I don't consider myself a film buff) once I see them in the theater, I very rarely get the opportunity or make a point to watch them again on DVD, steaming, VOD etc...  This always puts me at a disadvantage when it comes to a franchise film, cause I can't remember what the hell happened the last time we experienced these characters and stories.<br /><br />Thankfully, all you really have to know to watch Hugh Jackman once again take on the role of Marvel Entertainment's ultimate anti-social hero - The Wolverine - is the basics.  He's indestructible because of the Adamantium alloy that covers his insides from head to toe; and that he had it bad for the telepathic and telekinetic mutant Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), who is presently dead until she rises again as The Phoenix.READ MORE [...]

B00E1LR2B4|3.0|One of my early on fantasies was to either sass my way through \\"Hit the Road Jack\\" as a Raelette, backing up the great Ray Charles. Or grove with the ultimate R&B legend, Luther Vandross, who left us way too soon. Or believe it or not, really wanted to harmonize with Reba McEntire, you'd be amazed at how many of her songs from the 90's I know by heart.  The on the road lifestyle would have suited me well too; there's nothing tying me to being a homebody, a new city every other night, 4 star hotels, the camaraderie of the other musicians and roadies, staying up till 2am, getting up at noon - all of it would have fit right into my idea of living the life!<br /><br />And I would have pursued this dream too, if it weren't for one thing -  I can't sing.  I mean, I can carry a tune, but believe me, there's nobody asking me to belt out a number.  I know other people who also think being a backup singer for famous singers and musicians would be a dream come true - so it's odd that Twenty Feet From Stardom, a documentary by Morgan Neville, decided to show the disappointments and dissatisfaction that comes from being in the background rather than center stage.<br /><br />The idea for this doc came from former president of A&M records Gil Friesen, who suggested it to Morgan Neville for his next project. Neville said when he began researching the world of backup singers he found very little information, movies, articles etc on the subject and wound up interviewing over 50 different singers of varying ages, race and musical backgrounds. And I think in light of this, the subject deserves a second pass with this wider spectrum in mind.  Don't get me wrong...READ MORE [...]
B001KZVQJI|5.0|Delivered in an exceptional amount of time. Still in plastic wrapper, so it's the definition of brand new. The s&h isn't even too bad, so I thought it was well worth it. Not to mention the fact that it's Blu-ray, that makes everything so much better!

B005LAIGOQ|5.0|It's not easy reviewing movies as we all have our individual tastes.  I love scary/creepy movies, especially those that don't have an excess of special effects. Movies like &#34;Paranormal Activity&#34; and &#34;The Conjuring&#34; get 1 and 2 stars from me.  My taste runs to &#34;The Others&#34; and &#34;What Lies Beneath.&#34;  More psychological, less CG.  My husband doesn't usually care for this genre at all, but he really liked this movie.
B002QYNIHU|4.0|This is my very frist sh. Figurarts figure. It is awesome and I love how he's has the articulTion hidden. Also changing faces was easy to I thought it would be difficult but no. Only complaint is that the head was to loose on mine so it comes of when positioning the head.
1579128955|3.0|For a non-scientist like me this a somewhat helpful look at the basic building blocks of the Universe.  I came to this book from a movie I saw, which featured Mr. Gray and his magnificent table.  Unfortunately this book did not do a good job in explaining some things that went by too quickly in the film.  This is essentially a picture book, and pictures of the elements in their unrefined state doesn't help me understand how they combine to produce the world as we know it.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I avoided this book like the plague because the subject matter seemed way too heavy.  Don’t get me wrong, I love a novel filled with angst and sorrow but this would be too much for even me to handle.  I had been told by fellow readers that it’s a book that MUST be read.  With a heavy heart I decided to find some courage and tackle this book with an open mind.<br /><br />“As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.”<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars in an incredibly well written and thought out book, filled with memorable characters and a heartbreaking plot.  There’s even a twist that I did not see coming and I welcomed it with open arms.  Mind you, I think I needed therapy and some Xanax by the time I was done but it was definitely engaging.  The first few chapters did seem a little slow for me but it wasn’t a bad thing, I believe the author was setting up the foundation of a profound story of love and loss.<br /><br />“Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.”<br /><br />This is the story of a two teenagers battling cancer.  Not only do they become friends but they ultimately fall in love and the journey they embark on is one that will move you to tears.  As I read this book I felt like I was running out of time because I wanted them to experience a life without cancer, without the worry of the doom and gloom that was constantly nipping at their heels.<br /><br />“What a slut time is. She screws everybody.”<br /><br />The writing is absolutely stellar and incredibly clever.  The dialogue between Hazel and Augustus was filled with wit, sarcasm and amazing insight on life.  I really don’t have the words to describe what this book did to me.  Could I re-read it?  Probably not because it’s way too heavy but I highlighted a number of quotes that I don’t want to forget.  Yes, the writing is that good.<br /><br />“You realize that trying to keep your distance from me will not lessen my affection for you. All efforts to save me from you will fail.”<br /><br />I don’t know much about John Green but I’ve become one of his many fans and I will definitely be reading more books by this talented author.  He’s written a truthful story about what’s it’s like to have a terminal illness and how it impacts those around you.  While this is a tough book to read for many different reasons, it’s a story that must be read and one you won’t regret.at I don’t want to forget.

1475143389|3.0|The content of the book deserves more than 3 stars the reason I gave only 3 is because at the end of the book is a link where you can download extra information from Michael M. web site once you put your e-mail address in his site so you can have access to the extra information your inbox will be filled with SPAM lot's of them so be warned!! the author shares your info with SPAMERS, I did not expect this and I regret registering in his site.DO NOT DO IT. He might argue this is not true but as soon as I did it I started to get tons of weight loss SPAM from different e-mail addresses. This put me in really bad mood.<br /><br />About the book, the book is good, you will find information that most of the gym trainers will not give you I still have to see the results but most of the information is very useful, I found lacking the nutrition part of the book, save few dollars and get a real nutrition book, The Shredded Chef: 120 Recipes...book from Michael only have recipies and not real information about nutrition facts, if you want to understand \\"why we are what we eat\\" please read this amazing book: Advanced Sports Nutrition-2nd Edition by Dan Benardot goes very deep into the topics but is worth the reading and after that I realized that I would need a nutrition expert to help me balance my diet but now I know a lot of things I really ignored.<br /><br />So it's worth your dollars, yes it is, just don't share your mail with the author.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I absolutely Loved it! I did a marathon run and now I can't wait for season 9 to start in a couple days!
B004L9MFM2|5.0|Brilliant, incredibly detailed world. Epic stories. GRRM is truly the Tolkein of our age (and he has much better writing skills!).
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Never knew Hugh was this musically talented!  Followed his PBS  special,  showing him playing piano and guitar. Also liked listening to his guests.
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|Pretty good. I heard there were some reviews that said it had too much action and didn't focus enough on exploration when compared to the original. The original was a different generation. Those guys weren't really athletes and didn't have the same demands for action scenes. Fitness and exercise has evolved since then. In terms of action in older movies they are hard to watch because they lack it. I love the original. I grew up watching the reruns as a kid...regarding the reboot I wish they had picked a curvy actress that actually looks more like Nichele Nichols. Zoe isn't bad just too skinny, and when conmpared to Nichele....well there isn't a comparison. Nichele wasn't fat, as a matter of fact she was in excellent shape and very pretty....but whatever...the bridge....a little shiny for my tastes too...but still it's a great movie
B00785P2QC|4.0|This app is fun to play. Many positives, like the city still living when not in the app, upgrades, goals, fun things to build. Good way to pass time.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game and love horses. I just wish there was more to do with riding. But recommend this game to all horse lovers
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|***spoilers possible***<br />Tom Cruise really needs to start picking roles that don't require the name \\"Jack\\". In this one, he's Jack Harper, a tech sent around to repair drones. The movie is set in a post-war future where \\"we\\" won but the earth was nearly destroyed in the process.<br /><br />Our hero ends up teaming up with the last vestiges of true humanity and fighting for the freedom of the planet. The dream scenes are kind of a stretch as are some of the major plot points, but if you consider that most science fiction things are farfetched, it becomes reasonable.<br /><br />There were plenty of times in the movie where I just wanted it to get to a point, but overall, it's an okay sci-fi flick. I wouldn't add it to my list of top 100 movies ever made or even put it on my Christmas wish list, but it's worth seeing once or twice if you're a fan of science fiction films.
0345803507|5.0|The Shades of Grey Trilogy was a very good story.  A little trashy but an outstanding story and well written.  I chose this book because it was the last of the three and I had the other two.  I would definitely want any other books that E L James decides to write.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A great lesson about life and how we deal with things we can't change and acceptance. I love the way the author draws you in, inserts the hook...
B0025KVLU6|5.0|Excellent and classic. My son is learning the magic of the Beatles.  As it should be. He will be a Beatles fan for life.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Any game of gameloft is great, because  every game they make that I buy its always a great game. For example brothers in arms 2 , blitz brigade (was Great and free) and many more . Trust every gameloft game that you buy. You WON'T regret it.
B008011XQQ|5.0|Great Santana music.  All but one track are excellent instrumentals.  Sometimes the guest artists seem to detract from Santana's great guitar.  His other instrumentalists are also playing near perfection.
B006BQNJR8|4.0|Okay, let's get this right out of the way: this is a good film, and had Arnold not made the Conan films in the 80s, this would be a great film.  Momoa does an outstanding job of playing the warrior (in truth, his is closer to the literary Conan than Arnold's films), but the truth is that too many folks cannot get that iconic films out of their heads.  All in all the cast makes it an outstanding film, and for your sword and sorcery ones, this is top-notch.<br /><br />The bottom line: it's a Conan film, and in truth more Conan than the 80s films, but it's not a \\"Conan\\" film - and most people see it in that light.  If you're a first time watcher, put aside the Arnold expectations and then you'll have a funtime.
1476727651|5.0|Finally the master story teller is back in form.The early portion of the book rambles just a bit , but I guess necessarily so , as it sets the scene for everything else that follows. I will try to stay away from anything that would be a spoiler . Dan Torrance is now a grown man troubled by alcoholism and his own history. The first part tells of his attempts to overcome the alcohol  addiction.,then he begins to receive mysterious messages from a young girl with even more of a shine. Eventually they will join forces to battle against a cult of ancient people called the True Knot, who have been kidnapping and torturing children for many years . Stephen King again at his best.
B00F96P8S4|5.0|It's Cher. She is an amazing singer, actor, and what a beautiful women with an honest look at life. She is nothing phoney. I could listen to her sing all the time. Her voice is unique. I found this music very close and personal.
6301976622|5.0|I paid my money to watch Quo Vadis in a theater when it first came out. After 60-some years I still remember certain scenes and performances. I was enthralled with Peter Ustinov's portrayal of Nero -- no, he WAS Nero!<br />  Any lover of good movies should see this one. I was surprised to find a used VHS copy of this 2-tape set available for 74 cents (plus S&H). It arrived in timely fashion and was in near-perfect condition.<br />  If you can find other copies for sale -- buy and enjoy!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|So far this game is okay,  but tutorial much too long. It's a GAME! Let us figure it out and have fun. If it's so different/ difficult that we need school to play it then why even market it? Even for free....just okay. Good concept, but seems like makers don't have confidence in the players( actually, in themselves)!!!!!
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|The picture card flash memory cards are no longer available in shops. So I was relieved to find them through you.<br />Thank you
B0018OAOQC|5.0|not my favorite they have, but is still worth the listen. i listen to all the other cds all the time
B00CRS88IO|1.0|Not very good. Sorry I wasted my money. Not interesting, not enjoyable, not even terribly well written. It's not garbage, but not worth anything.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, exciting. A real page turner. It is not only for teens  and it is not just for kids.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is relaxing way to pass the time without having to move around and concentrate too hard. 5 stars :)
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Kept me busy for quite awhile. Good storyline if you choose to read it.  Graphics Are ok. Puzzles are challenging but not overly challenging. Negative... I don't see this as a good choice for replayability.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|this is a awesome game! I would recommend this game to everyone. the controls are shakey at first but you get hang of it.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|This story moved along nicely, but was pretty typical.  I think the explicit sexual descriptions could have been handled more tenderly.
B008602KQI|5.0|A bit slow at the beginning, but well worth the wait. Jennifer Lawrence is terrific. Eagerly awaiting the next installment.
B00FEN000S|5.0|Best Movie I have seen in years. Awesome action with characters you will love and care about. An excellent example of world building done right. Must see!!!
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Well, not really fun for the whole family - kids will probably have nightmares if they watch it. But, when I'm watching a zombie movie, I consider that a mark of success!<br /><br />My wife and I both loved this movie. We sat down to watch it with some trepidation, because of all the low ratings it received on Amazon. We figured we'd give it a shot anyway, because: a) we like zombies, b) the advertisements looked sweet, and c) hey it has Brad Pitt in it.<br /><br />It turns out, we made the right choice. The movie was a blast, from start to finish (A to Z)!
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|I don't remember when I have enjoyed a movie so much that I watched it 2 nights in a row!  I want to own it.<br />Very nicely done.  All music and history lovers should see this film.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers I won't stop playing totally recommend for whoever is thinking of buying it !!!!:)<br />Better than temple run not opsticles dodge uhh dbshdhdhcbrhehdbc free hrudhdfbfhcrhrcfhfhvbrhryryf dbshdhdhcbrhehdbc fhfhdndurhdudh bfueudheuehdhfdddddd dbshdhdhcbrhehdbc sorry it said to review u had to write 20 words so yea
B000QCSA54|5.0|Very make-sense. Very encouraging! The Dip is a book that will get one moving, or stop the movement, whatever one requires in one's situation. Only be the best. Very good advice.
B00B2EWNWG|3.0|It was ok. The action/fight scenes could have been better.  The plot also needed a little more work.  I know they were going for golden age martial arts movie type, but it left a lot desired.
B005KDDUVS|5.0|Es un libro fascinante cuyo contenido logra despertar diversas emociones en el lector. Me gustó mucho el estilo en el que está escrito, el lenguaje que emplea y la capacidad de trasladar, a través de su relato, a escenarios de otra época.
B00ECLU346|5.0|laughed so hard that her sides hurt when she saw this movie. Out of the three Hangover movies, this was the second funniest, with the original being the funniest. The second one was just ok.
B009LOJK1Q|4.0|Great book. I have been a fan of his since \\"The Stand\\" and have read the majority of his books since then except for the \\"Dark Tower\\" series which held no interest to me. Will never look at RV drivers the same again after reading this. Loved the way Dan and Abra teamed up. I must comment on the Kindle Price though. $31.00 US to get it delivered to my Kindle vs $16.00 in Australian currency from my local department store in paperback version. What gives. Love my kindle but may have to go back to paper if publishers think I am going to pay $31.00 for what amounts to an emailed version of a book.
B00DL2W7Q4|3.0|Gladwell does his usual job here but gets it 'more right' than he did in 'What the Dog' saw. Examples and links are good.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|it works really well and I love the max number of snoozes option, it keeps me on track and wakes me up gently.
B005HED11Y|5.0|The Original Star Trek looks great in HD!  The remasters look great and even though I own the Blu-rays I can be lazy and not even leave the couch to put in a new disc.  It's also makes Amazon Prime that much better a deal.  Have a TOS Marathon as Seasons 2 and three have also been remastered and look great!
B00578FKVE|5.0|Great show, wish the series continued for more than just 2 seasons, Watched season one like in three days, lol .
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Absolutely one of the funniest TV series that can be found. You will shoot coke through your nose at some of this stuff. Ed  O'neil and the gang are truly funny.
B000002BHE|5.0|I just recently got into Celine's discography (I only really knew \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" which is one of my favorite songs) and this album was a standout for me. There are fun songs and beautiful ballads paired with Celine's fantastic and unreal voice.<br />There is honestly not one song that I don't like on this album. I think it's a must-have for all Celine fans and the first album that potential new fans should listen too.<br /><br />It's hard to pick just one stand-out track, but \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\\" is an awesome power ballad.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This is by far the most entertaining zombie apocalyptic film that can be seen. Characters will draw you into the drama and their sorrows and stuggles. While the gore is there, it is secondary to the masterful screenplay, directing, producing, and acting from all who involved in this film. From a avid &#34;zombie&#34; addict, I just want to say thank you to Robert Kirkman, Greg Nicotero and all the others who have created...at last, a film that rivals and surpasses the Romero films. Congrats guys! If you are into zombie movies, DEFINATELY get this entire series.
B006RXQ800|5.0|Good movie! Saw this movie on showtime. Took me bout three nights to complete on DVR sooo I bought it.
B008H6GHL0|1.0|This RE does not hold a candle to the first anime RE. Story and plot was were disjoined and made no sense. Not a good movie.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Makes you think of the plight of the German people who didn't want the Nazis. GREAT character development. I'd recommend it.
B008JFUR10|2.0|I can't believe I wasted my money on this. The actors are boring, story boring. I was looking forward to this movie but a little more then half way I had to stop watching. It would have been good as a cartoon in the morning and that's about it. This is coming from somebody who loved transformers and Battleship.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I like using this app on my android tablet. It is very user friendly. Of course I don't like how this survey has a minimum number of words that you have to use to complete the survey, lol. So that is why I added this part.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|Excellent puzzle game / time killer. Amusing premise, fun game play, and just the right level of challenge to be a great time killer.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This is nothing but a temple run rip off . Cheap graphics , and it is so hard that it is annoying for me !!!!! HATE IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|One of my favorite books of alltime! Hugo's use of history and vocabulary really made this a great read, for me....
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Rarity and Rainbow Dash. I didn't mind grinding for Fluttershy as much, but gems to finish the game? Come on, get realistic please.
B00555X8OA|5.0|rew:201310050610<br />With pleasure I return to this text in order to write a short summary in the spirit of the idea that it can be nicely joined as the last Note of the Kindle book and thus included in Notes, Highlights and Bookmarks file which follows every Kindle book and is any time available for the reader. Unfortunately only to be looked at, but not handled as a whole. This handicap can be overcome easily by screen shots. So, why does not Amazon allow it to be directly downloaded for the benefit of the reader for easier use as source material anywhere.<br />But returning to this stunning book I am in lack of sufficient overwords. I do not remember that I would ever have read any psychology book before. So I have read it as a complete layman, but had no difficulty at all understanding every passage of it. As a matter of fact the book is not only psychology, but a lucid presentation of the methods of psychology, common to all behavioral sciences, so to me as economist, too. This book has no side walks, but is the story of thinking, fast and slow, just as the cover tells. These two concepts I meet first time ever, but they are clearly defined so that even a layman dares to paraphrase them as effortless thinking and thinking with effort. Kahneman is a nobelist in just economics and well deserves it. Good thinking is also a matter of economics. That is comp&ouml;etely clear. Another brilliant concept, which I meet first time here in this book, although it belongs outright to the central concepts of economics as well: WYSIATI - What You See Is All There Is. Do not smile, it is a serious term, not at all expressing something superficial, but is a profound characterization of human behavior.<br />Kahnemans presentation is completely based on experience and well organized simple experiments of how we think and decide things. And he does not at all hoist his own profile, but continuously refers to colleagues, quite especially beautifully to his defunt partner with words 'Amos and I'. You get the impression that if Amos Tversky had lived, he would have stepped side by side with the author to the podium of honor in Stockholm.<br />So there is no doubt of five stars for one of the best nonfiction books I ever have read. Already after having read a few pages I ordered a copy for my daughter, a professional psychologist. With keen interes I wait her comments.get the impression that if Amos Tversky had lived, he would have stepped side by side with the author to the podium of honor in Stockholm.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|Building your book for Kindle e-book is very informative and helpful when you need info for building e-books for kindle.
B00EUM4ZQE|3.0|I think it's misleading that Amazon does not label the album as \\"censored.\\"  If you want the album without blips in the lyrics you need to buy the one labeled \\"explicit.\\"<br /><br />Album is 4 stars but I'm knocking one off for the inconvenience.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|This is classics, maybe not for everyone, but one of my favorite books. May be difficult to read for the readers who are looking for thrilling story but the plot is extremely interesting and deep. Your brain will not relax. It is good to get back to this book now and then, you'll always find something new.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A 4 not a 5 but still a must read. For me the events became a little drawn out just past halfway. The 'must read' comes from the unique plot, twist in events, and the way seemingly unlinked characters are brought together in the end.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|A good follow up to The Shining. Whereas some of his more recent books where horrible (Cell) or just not interesting enough to finish (The Dome), this one kept me engaged until the end. Being a recovering alcoholic might have had something to do with this as well.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent read and an original plot. Couldn't put it down, and was very pleased with the satisfying conclusion. Will be reading this authors other books.
B005LAIIGM|5.0|I first heard about the movie Gravity from Phil Plait's \\"Bad Astronomy\\" website. He's a real stickler for scientifically accurate movies, and what he'd heard about Gravity had him very enthused early on.<br /><br />So, early in the morning on the day of release, I went down to the theater, caught the first non-IMAX 3D showing, and was blown away.<br /><br />Let's start with the opening visuals of Earth from orbit. Gorgeous. That alone was worth the ticket price. It gets better as the shuttle and its crew come into view.<br /><br />Once the accident occurs and the two surviving astronauts find themselves in a desperate situation, I was astounded by how realistic the physics felt. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, and in space things behave very differently from what we're used to here on the ground. The way the astronauts yo-yoed about on their tethers as they tried to grab onto each other or onto a nearby structure had my heart pounding.<br /><br />A common complaint from purists about space movies is the all-too-familiar sound of whooshing spaceships or the ear-splitting thuds as things explode. Not in Gravity. The only sounds heard in vacuum are those transmitted by the spacesuits. When things explode, the music is what heightens the drama.<br /><br />The two main characters were played by George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, and they do a fine job of acting, perfectly believable throughout the film. Enough said.<br /><br />As Phil Plait pointed out on his site, Gravity does stretch the science in a few places. In real life, it would be virtually impossible to get from the orbit of the Hubble Space Telescope to that of the International Space Station. That's why, during the final 2009 telescope servicing mission, they actually had a spare shuttle ready on the launching pad, just in case the astronauts needed rescue. But, obviously, there would be no movie if the producers insisted on this level of accuracy, so they fudged things a bit. No matter.<br /><br />As for the PG-13 rating, it's warranted. This is one VERY intense movie. Are you old enough to remember the first time you saw Jaws in the theater back in 1975? Remember the way everyone shrieked when that severed head popped out of the hole in the side of the boat? Well, there are a couple of comparable scenes in Gravity early on. No one shrieked, but it was definitely gruesome.<br /><br />There's also a bit of language, but nothing I can't imagine myself saying if I were suddenly cast adrift in a space accident.<br /><br />All in all, this one is well worth the seeing, and I'm glad I did. But, with this level of intensity, could I stand another viewing? Maybe if I go with a friend.
B008JFUO36|4.0|I thought this was a good movie.  I'm a little bias when it comes to Cruise, I don't think the man has made a &#34;bad&#34; movie, some just didn't do as well as others.
0307595862|5.0|Wow what a book. Highly recommend this author to any mystery fan  Can't wait to read more of he Harry Hole series.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|Really sadden when Adm Pike was killed.  Also missed the inter actions of Capt Kirk's love interests, but all in all really like this installment.
B00008XEOI|5.0|I had missed one of the Lion King's dvds. and I have a grandson who has always loved the story.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|In Super 8, JJ Abrams was successful in re-creating the feelings that were present in ET, as well as several movies from the era: Childlike wonder for the world, camaraderie among friends, and a drive for adventure. He also nailed the \\"period piece\\" effort, making this seem like a movie that was ripped right from the late 70s/early 80s, with nothing that I could detect that disrupted the illusion. Meticulous details were covered, and the effort was very impressive. As for the plot itself, I thought it was a fantastic homage to monster movies, sci-fi, and the aforementioned ET, which was obviously a huge inspiration for this movie (although this one is far more violent, just to warn you). I also really appreciated how the creature design had subtle homages to both ET and Cloverfield, Abrams' most famous monster. The CGI is top notch (as to be expected from a Bad Robot production) and not overused, and the monster is cleverly revealed only in brief glimpses throughout until the final showdown, much like the brilliantly doled out Cloverfield beastie. This was a great movie that took me back to the days of my childhood, successfully recapturing those feelings that I got when watching movies like Goonies when I was a kid... and it's a great \\"alternative\\" Halloween movie for these brisk October nights!
0062200909|4.0|This was a Christmas gift. The grandchild liked it. He is a big Lord of the Rings fan and this had just come out.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Fun, not real difficult game.  Pretty pictures.  Does take up battery with the pictures.  Waiting to see the bonus round.
B000W91RUG|4.0|This was a Christmas gift. It came as advertised. She used it and was happy with it. It was okay.
B0018OIK0E|5.0|Shaun of the dead is a great movie full of action and comedy. Very different zombie movie. The comedy is very different. Great movie.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I've always just used the traditional look.  Like how you can move the board around. Just wish my Kindlw HD would stay powered up longer so I can play longer.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Zombieland is full of great comedy and action. Woody Harrelson is hilarious and is a bad ass. Great zombie  movie. Very different.

B006LSZECO|1.0|This is a well written book that I'm sorry I spent my money on.  I hated the characters, and wish I hadn't fallen for the good reviews of the writing and paid more attention to the reviewers who wished they could erase the characters from their memory.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|We discovered Big Bang last year and have been happily catching up. We haven't finished the whole series yet but this season has more exploration of the characters and their interactions. We thoroughly enjoy it, especially since we are pretty much nerds ourselves. We even get some of the jokes about physics.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I BOUGHT THE WHOLE SET AND JUST PURCHASED THE NEW SEASON.  I CAN'T WAIT TO GET IT.  EACH CHARACTER HAS THEIR OWN SPECIAL PERSONALITIES.  ALTHOUGH VERY SERIOUS EPISODES ARE SO DOWN TOEARTH THE ACTORS DO HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR.  WHO EVER CHOSE THE ACTORS DID A GOOD JOB AND THE WRITERS ARE GREAT.  CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT EACH EPISODE.I EVEN WATCH THEM ON TV EVEN THOUGH I HAVE THE EPISODES ON DVDS.  AM I CRAZY YES ANOUT CRIMINAL MINDS ?I SURE AM.  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!

B00ET7ICEQ|5.0|Easy to listen to after a day of work. Sheryl has such a soothing voice and love to sing along.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Very good game with a touch of faith which is very refreshing in this day and age. Unfortunately I finished it in one sitting. I wish it had been longer, but Don't we say that of all games we enjoy? Graphics were good and so are the voices.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Would recommend this game to anyone. Love the mini games as well. I enjoy playing this game it is fun and entertaining.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game, really addictive. Great for unwinding at the end of the day. Does anyone know what the highest level is that you can achieve?
B0058YPL66|5.0|From the 1st episode I was hooked, & couldn't wait to own the seasons! I have the 2nd already, looking forward to the 3rd series

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I read this happily . KING Rounds up Danny's life. I still can't believe he became an alcoholic. If he had a way to stop the bad ghosts by locking them up why did he have to drink his shining away. It was just a plot device to bring all the people together for the story. But I read it happily. I identify with Mr king. But I know what true horror is.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This book got lots of flack because it was written by a Muslim author.  But, Aslan is obviously well-studied on the history of the region and provides lots of texture about Jesus' situation.  For me it was a chance to meditate on the world where Christ lived, taught, and was crucified.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I mostly only watch the show on dvd as the Australian network that airs it, has no respect for the show - often changing air times; routinely showing it late at night (usually well after 9.30pm); episodes out of order etc etc.  (it's also a plus watching it without the endless ads)<br /><br />A fun show with a great cast that deserves better treatment by TV.
0780622553|5.0|This is one of my favorite science fiction movies.  I first saw it in Mexico in Spanish and despite some comments you might read about it from some folks in my opinion [and of some critics I admire] it is a much underrated film.  It is one of those films I can watch more than once and get something out of it each time.

B00D8HNR2K|4.0|Not bad.  A little more pop than I was expecting, but less ambient than The Slip.  Everything is in 4/4 time.  Appreciate the length of the album, and the number of songs.  I would still categorize this under whiny Reznor, kind of like Year Zero, but there is obvious passion in the music that can bleed through to the listener.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|After two years being fairly happy with my Garmin 405cx the battery malfunctioned rendering the unit unusable. This is a frequent problem with this product which can be confirmed with a bit of online sleuthing.  This is a design and or manufacturing problem not just \\"one of those things\\". Unfortunately Garmin have decided not to stand behind their product so if you are out of warranty too bad, you're on your own.<br /><br />I doubt I'll buy Garmin again.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|3/12 - I had heard a lot of hype and a lot of abuse regarding this book, I read it to see what all the fuss was about. I kind of wish I hadn't as it gave me nightmares and then the next day daymares as well, I couldn't get some of the more violent scenes out of my head and my imagination/memory kept replaying scenes and phrases from the book - I was actually quite disturbed and even now, thinking about what I'm going to write gives me the shivers. I didn't mind the first couple of chapters (probably a 2.5 star review up to there), until the scene where she goes to his house and is introduced to The Red Room of Pain. After that this 'romance' became more like a horror story. There was the fear of impending pain and torture; there was the actual pain and torture, which had my heart rate going and was making me sweat (and not in the good way of a normal romance book); there was a particularly disgusting scene that made me spontaneously exclaim \\"ewww!\\" while I was reading; and there was the climax of the story with the heroine surviving the nightmare and escaping (but it's a trilogy, so she will somehow end up back in the same horror story in the near future). Doesn't that sound like a great, truly scary horror story? In fact if this was marketed as a horror story I would be giving it 4 stars, as it's a truly disturbing book. I think Dean Koontz and Stephen King could take some notes from this book regarding how to truly terrify their readers. Unfortunately this is categorised as a romance, so all that horror/terror/disgust is called seduction/foreplay/sex. A romance shouldn't make the reader feel a bit sick, uncomfortable and/or stressed while they're reading it. I read it really fast, finishing it within 24 hours, but that was mostly because I was worried this 'romance' was going to end with the hero (ha!) beating the heroine half to death because he likes to cause pain. In my humble opinion physical violence of any kind should never be allowed into a relationship - you start out with a bit of spanking and it's not long before it leads to black eyes and broken collar bones. Christian, the hero, is damaged emotionally by his upbringing and feels the need to control, dominate and inflict pain - I want to know how that is any different from the men putting their wives and/or children in the hospital monthly because they like to inflict pain. After finishing this I immediately ran to a real romance in an attempt to scrub some of the terrifying scenes out of my head and replace them with some actual romance. Unfortunately it didn't work very well, the bad memories always stick better than the good.ou start out with a bit of spanking and it's not long before it leads to black eyes and broken collar bones.

B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Love Harry Hole! Have enjoyed EVERY book in this series.Hope we have NOT seen the end of harry for a long,long time!
0345533666|4.0|6/1 - This is a good legal thriller with the ADA's son as the main, if not only, suspect of the murder of a boy from his class. The only evidence of his guilt is the discovery of a single fingerprint on the jacket of the murder victim, with no way of telling when Jacob (the ADA's son) touched the victim; and some hearsay that the victim bullied the defendant given as a reason for motive.<br />That sounds like very weak evidence to base a homicide case on. If Jacob hadn't been the ADA's son then I don't think the DA would have been so quick to take the case to trial, she didn't want to seem like she was being soft on Jacob because of who his father is. Jack McCoy (long-standing ADA in Law and Order played by Sam Waterstone) would never have gone to trial with such flimsy evidence. I like the way Landay gives us little hints and teasers of what's coming up in the last section of the book. I can see something's going to happen between Andy and Laurie and I'm not as convinced of Jacob's innocence as Andy claims to be. I think Jacob is too smug and some of the evidence that the jury isn't going to see, like the violent porn website and the knife that he owned, plus the off-colour 'jokes' about the murder and his apparent desire for his 15 minutes of fame all add up to a boy that appears a lot more guilty than the actual 'evidence' shows he is.<br /><br />8/1 - WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD. I really liked the way the scenes from the courtroom featuring Andy and Logiudice were a trick. As you read it you think you're reading bits from him testifying at Jacob's trial and then suddenly, you realise it's not Jacob's trial it's Laurie's. I thought Jacob might not be innocent and so I wasn't all that surprised when another dead body turned up around Jacob, but I didn't imagine he would be stupid enough to repeat his crime so soon after being set free, plus this time he didn't have ANY obvious motive. Why would he want to kill this girl who was interested in him, unless he's graduated from simply troubled to an actual sociopath. It wasn't made clear, I guess the reader is supposed to make up their own mind. I WAS surprised by the revelation that Laurie killed Jacob. I feel like he has parents who's emotions sat at either end of the spectrum. Laurie didn't believe that Jacob was innocent from the beginning and was constantly planning how to deal with his conviction and sentence as well as how they should deal morally as the parents of a murderer, while Andy believed 100% in Jacob's innocence against all the evidence, even after the second murder (not sure I could be so 100% sure of my child). I don't think either parent handled the situation well, you can't fall apart and you can't implicitly trust whatever your child tells you. I mean, do you trust your 15-year-old when they tell you that they haven't been drinking, even though you can smell the alcohol on their breath? No, so why would you trust, without any qualifications, what you're child tells you about a much more serious crime? Anyway, despite my problems with Andy's naivete and Laurie's idiotic belief in the 'murder gene' I really enjoyed the story especially the misdirection angle.from simply troubled to an actual sociopath.

1416550542|4.0|27/05 - I think Nell was a bit of an ungrateful fool to pull away from her sisters and father and fiancee (I understand that even less) just because she found out she was \\"adopted\\". That doesn't mean that anyone loved her any less, in fact you might say that her parents loved her more as they chose to keep her (not quite the same as giving birth to a baby, you have to love it as that's your baby, you don't get to pick and choose and say \\"no I don't like that one, send it back\\") - her father could have handed her over to whoever wrote the letter looking for her. Her sisters knew her better and for longer than they would have known each other, especially the oldest as Nell would have been the only other sibling she had for a few years. So while I am really enjoying the writing and the other 95% of the story so far, that withdrawal from the people who loved her does bug me. To be continued...<br /><br />1/06 - Still loving this. The intrigue of the mystery has overshadowed my irritation at Nell's earlier behaviour. Until coming back to this review to update it I had almost forgotten that that was how the story began. All Morton's books are atmospheric and I feel like I'm actually there and I can totally see the locations, but this particular location seems to call to me more than her others. I want to live at that cottage. I've always been a loner and an isolated cottage at the top of a steep hill sounds like a good place to hide away with a book and a crackling fire, or in the garden if it's not too cold or wet. No more door-to-door energy salesman, no more red cross volunteers and no more noisy or nosy neighbours peeking over your fence or through your windows. It sounds like the perfect place to become the neighbourhood 'crazy cat lady', except I'd have lots of dogs instead of cats.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Read this with my 10 years old.  We got sucked in instantly.  I loved the characters.  They made such an impact on my son and I appreciate that.  I loved how he understood the complexities of the characters and the reasons for their actions.  It was powerfully written.  We are on Speaker now and so far Card's brilliance continues to impact my son and I.
B008GVD6D8|3.0|14/2 - I keep getting the Fifty storylines confused with Bared to You. In this situation I would usually say to myself that I need to go back and re-read the Fifty trilogy again to reacquaint myself with what happened and in order to separate the plot from the Bared to You plot. The only problem with the normal solution is that, as you can see from Fifty reviews, I didn't really like the Fifty trilogy, certainly not enough to re-read any of them - so I guess I'm stuck with overlapping plots replaying in my head as I read, kind of like a double-exposed photo. Although there are a lot of very similar elements and general plot lines, fortunately they're not exact copies, especially not in the BDSM area. In one scene Eva practically invites him to hurt her and he refuses to saying that he could never hurt her; when I read those lines I couldn't help but imagine what Christian Grey would have done - something that probably involved sore palms.<br /><br />15/2 - According to the back of the book this is a darker version of Fifty. I totally disagree. Reflected in you has characters who are even more stuffed up than Ana and Christian, but there's almost no violence and no one who wants to inflict pain but holds themselves back because it scares the other person (and rightly so). Eva is a much more complex and realistic character than Ana, I didn't find myself silently telling her to run, not walk, away from Gideon before he does some serious physical damage to her (as I was while reading FSoG). And I don't find Gideon physically scary the way I did Christian Grey, I wasn't reading on eggshells waiting for Gideon to explode over something Eva did that he didn't like. Sure he got frustrated with some of the things Eva did, but I never felt like he was about to commit domestic violence against her and put her in the hospital the way I did reading FSoG. I was suprised by how much of the book Eva and Gideon spend apart - they spend half the book fighting and half of what's left having angry sex that doesn't make anything better. One character that I did spend most of the book wanting to shake until his brain rattled was Cary, he drove me crazy constantly trying to ruin his almost relationship with Trey (who seemed like a nice, normal guy who could support Cary if he would let him). This book almost doesn't fit in the BDSM category, it just read like a normal contemporary romance with very complex characters. I can't wait to see how the trilogy is going to end.having angry sex that doesn't make anything better.

0316067938|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because even though it starts out with Jacob in pain it ends with him completely happy with his and Bella's situation. Personally I don't think I would be happy with the idea of living forever and ever and EVER - maybe for a few hundred years or the ability to know what will happen in the future, but I wouldn't want to live for infinity, to see the death of the planet and the solar system. I love the idea of getting all these vampires together for a battle (I wish there had been a battle because that would have been really exciting), with so many of them having extra supernatural abilities. If there had been a battle I'm sure Bella would have had no trouble shielding everyone while everyone else fought and the good guys would have won with only some injuries - no deaths. That would have been great (reminds me a bit of the final battle in Harry Potter). One logic problem I had with the \\"Jacob imprints on immortal half vampire baby\\" story line, what happens when Renesmee lives for hundreds of years - forever? Does Jake simply grow old and die or does he stay a shape shifter and live a lot longer (but still not forever) like the first chief did? Either way it seems to me he's going to die eventually and leave Renesmee behind. That doesn't seem right to me.

B005LLSZNM|5.0|Love this show, however I am a little concerned because above here it says review your purchases, and I did not purchase this, it was supposed to be prime available, the first 4 seasons. If I get charged for this I will not be happy. As I scroll down there is stuff on here that I have bought. I have never bought or rented a video on here, the prime shows are great especially this one. A friend suggested I watch the 1st episode, so I did, had a hard time stopping with 4 seasons to watch any time I wanted. Addictive show, but soooo good !!!

A unique and totally appropriate sound world is created by these two masters - a luminous sound which is at the same time free from excessive vibrato in the violin or from over-lush pedaling in the piano. The lines, winding around each other in and out, are always clear and distinct and yet forming a single texture or path. For sheer beauty of sound, I love the Laredo/Gould recordings also, but this is a very welcome addition to the catalogue.

B000FC1GJW|4.0|I loved the story, but the ending was rather disappointing. Also, many of the unanswered questions throughout the three books were not answered at all. Lyra was supposed to be &#34;Eva&#34; and I didn't get the part in the story in which she acted as such, maybe she did, but it wasn't very clear, neither the part in which Mary was supposed to tempt her. It was all too subtle for the anticipation the story gave the reader.

B00821OX98|5.0|Good. But theres one thing I didnt like and its amazon lets me see the first two seasons on my prime trial for free and when I wanted to see the third season amazon started charging $1.99 each episode.  Thats a real bummer. NETFLIX never does things like that. Wake up amazon arent your satisfied charging almost $80.00 a year in advance.
B005LJITS0|3.0|Not bad. It was entertaining. The best part was all the back story. They turned Hal Jordan into a bit of a clod who had to get his stuff together. The purists might find this hard to swallow...
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The movie was great, my 10 year old has read the first two books in a week. She was dying to see the movie. We definitely had some concerns over the content becoming &#34;real&#34; for her. It was great though and not particularly gory. Me all really enjoyed it.

B005LAIIGM|5.0|No sound in space. They did it right. GRAVITY is one of the best space films ever made. It seems so realistic, far beyond anything done in that regard. I found it to be thoroughly captivating to the point where I was so immersed in this film that I felt like I was really in space. I have not had that experience ever since I saw 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY way back in 1968 in the theater. GRAVITY really is an amazing film. For me the realism, the technical aspects really drive the narrative. They almost are the narrative. I can't say enough about GRAVITY.
0385345054|5.0|Very inspiring, tasteful book, beautiful pictures and very well explained projects. Contemporary paper flower design  taken to a higher level. A must have!!
B00BSWMITK|2.0|First off, I love Satch and buy all his albums. But I cannot get how people would rate this five stars, as it in no way compares to the inventiveness and songwriting of \\"Surfing with the alien\\" or \\"Engines of creation\\".<br />Most Satch songs have either a cool riff, or a beautiful melody, or a killer solo, and his best tunes usually have all three. But those elements are often lacking on this album. Is the execution top-notch? Duh! Is the production slick as? Yip. But the songs? Joe hasn't been saying much new for a while now, and this album continues that, unfortunately.<br />It's great to hear a different drummer for once (no offence to Jeff), and I love how Vinnie Colaiuta cuts loose on \\"Unstoppable momentum\\". But then it's interesting how he sounds remarkably like Jeff on songs lie \\"Celebration\\" and \\"Door into summer\\" with its easily accessible but over-used sound...<br />IMO the keyboards are given too much licence and don't add much value (and the keys/bass on \\"Weight of the world\\" sound like a nineties industrial training video, or maybe a Sonic the hedgehog soundtrack :)<br />Joe does rediscover the beauty of harmonised leads, which find their way into many of the tracks, but at the end of the day its the songwriting that counts, and for me the only song that matches his lofty standards is \\"I'll put a stone on your cairn\\" with Joe at his emotion-tugging best. But it's only about ninety seconds long!<br />It does for cool driving music, but if you're looking for the next great Satch album, this ain't it...
B0006J28L4|5.0|Denzel Washington's best film. What a profound and dynamic man to portray! This is one of my favorite movies ...
B00000JQFM|5.0|This is one of the few (maybe the only) guitar instrumental albums that I've seen listened to by non-guitarists, and for good reason. I've heard many shred albums and this one still tops my list as best. There simply isn't a weak song on it, and they're often so different from the other. The odd thing is, this wasn't a \\"first-listen\\" album for me. I was a little disappointed at first, but then as I listened to it more and more I realised how brilliant it is. For the minorities dishing out one star, maybe instrumental guitar is not your thing?? There's a reason why many tracks on this album still get performed at his live shows 25 years later: the MAJORITY of people love them.
B000EQHHJW|5.0|EVERONE should have this DVD!  Perfect introduction for ANYONE to understand  and appreciate OPERA!!  A BEAUTIFUL production and so enjoyable!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|amazing app works very well but does sometimes freezees up but besisides that it is a very good app yeah!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that this is a great game for all you fellow minion lovers. My advice is to buy this game right now
B001QB9H10|4.0|The first Transporter film was one that just had it all...writing, cast, romantic heat, no shortage of excitement from car chases and fight scenes.<br /><br />I really, really, really disliked [[ASIN:B000I9YX7O Transporter 2]]. I can't ever imagine watching it a second time. There was an attempt to shape actress Kate Nauta into a clone of 80s \\"creepy / hot\\" Brigitte Nielsen and they succeeded with the first half of that equation but not the second. François Berléand...in one of the first film's best supporting roles, Inspector Tarconi...was largely played for laughs, some bumbling Inspector Clousea type, and that's not what the character is at all...he's a sly fox, he's the smartest guy in the room.<br /><br />That said, I wasn't anxious to watch part 3 at all, even though I'd read some reviews and knew that there would be no return to the travesty that was part 2.<br /><br />Transporter 3 HAS the car stunts, the fight scenes, and in many ways, Frank is back to being Frank, Tarconi is back to being Tarconi. The film just MOVES at a slower pace, it doesn't crackle with the \\"downed power line\\" electricity of the first film. That's OK...it's moody and tense, and (in the words of the immortal \\"Farm Film Report\\" critics from SCTV, \\"things blow up real good.\\"<br /><br />Natalya Rudakova isn't Shu Qi (from the first film). The \\"chemistry\\" between her character Valentina and Frank is a bit forced...when I was an English major in college I became very familiar with the term \\"suspension of disbelief.\\" You basically have to turn off your \\"reality filters\\" to enjoy good (or bad) fiction. I believed the romantic tension and heat between Statham and Shu Qi in the first film, I don't believe the Rudakova-Statham pairing. The film uses a gimmick as old as the world itself (Valentina is ridiculously annoying until we \\"learn her story\\" and \\"see her vulberability\\" and then we're supposed to want to snuggle her and tell her everything is OK).<br /><br />The feeling I got at the end of Transporter 3...WITHOUT offering you any spoilers...was \\"OK, 3 is enough. The franchise doesn't end with the sour aftertaste of the second movie.\\"<br /><br />It MAY simply be that the first film was a fluke...serendipity...a convergence of all the right elements into a fun whole. As someone who LOVED that film, my recommendation is to avoid the second film like the plague and maybe do the \\"Amazon Instant Video Rental\\" on this one to see if you really want or need to own a copy.
B00280LYIM|5.0|The story is a lot of fun and I loved how much Greek mythology I learned in the process.  I was reading this as my 12 year old asked me to, but I enjoyed the read.
B00138H0H4|5.0|I love this cd.  I enjoy listening to it over and over again.  I think Brandie has a very unique voice and style to her music.  I am actually considering buying some of her other albums because of how much I enjoy this one.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|I loved it from start to end. One of the best movies I have seen in a very long time.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I could play this game all day long. It is fun. Great way to spend your free time. Fun fun fun.
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|Very, very good movie.  Smart, funny, even has humor for the parents.  Kids love it and watch it all the time.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app tells me what is going on with my iPhone battery and I trust it. I originally got the app because of an iPhone problem that this helped me resolve. So, it was a no brainer to put it on my Kindle Fire. I use it on a regular basis, even when traveling from home. If I had any other device, I would use this app.
039472903X|4.0|I have learned from and admired this book since I was a kid, and it is very insightful.  Some of Mr. Ogilvy's observations or more right on than others, and the layout of the book is sometimes a little cramped.  But it is full of wisdom from the real age of Mad Men, and many of us in the field of advertising and marketing would do well to take heed.
B005VT42BS|5.0|I did not understand what was gong on with my network and after buying this app, it was very easy to see. In fact I use this product on a regular basis and it works perfectly for my needs.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book did not grab my attention. The writing was adequate, but not attention addictive.  It was easy to set aside and move to other books.  I suppose I do not enjoy reading about narsictic, sick minded people.  If you do, then you will find the book attractive.  The author is very creative and imaginative in the script and plot.  I just hope none of the characters are my neighbors or, woe is me, relatives.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|One of Stephen Kings best books ever ..but I think that of all his books. Will keep you. Reading when  you know you should be  doing you're chores..
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this game becasue it's easy to play and moving the cards is so easy on the Kindlle Fire.
B00F6HOW4M|5.0|It's Drake being Drake....a real and great body of music.... the singles are singles for a reason and it truly seems to be Drake telling us his story and separating himself from the other rappers as he drops hit after hit including a ex's name drop explaining his young money issues and loyalty and a warning shot to other rappers
B0089EHWQE|5.0|When I started this book, I had no idea how it would spin out.  I got caught up in the characters which are beautifully fleshed out by the author, and soon I was also caught up in their lives.  As the novel progressed, even though there were hints of what was going to come, I still hung on to the hope that everything would have a Hollywood ending.  It has been too long since I cared enough about the characters in a novel to actually shed tears over the plot, but this novel got to me on many levels.  It is an eye-opener if a person has never had to deal with a severely disabled person, but it is also an uplifting and beautiful story.  Just two words.  Read it.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|'Nuff said. Missed these guys and I'm glad they're back.  They do not disappoint in the least. Looking forward to hearing more!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Very much a Vince Flynn novel. Plot and storyline are excellent and the writing keeps turning pages without wanting to stop to eat or sleep.<br />Very much recommend this book to anyone who likes thrillers.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Book 13 was a far better book.  All of our favorite characters stepped up to the plate and became who they were meant to be.  You cheered, you cried and leapt about for joy at the turn the story was taking.  Heroes worthy of the Horn of Valere were forming.<br />So silly me expected the wonderfullness to continue to the end of the story.  I understand that Perrin needed to kill the killer of the wolves.  But, geeze, was a lot of time spent on that!!  Perrin was doing things that only Rand could do and yet there was no explanation as to why he could do these things so quickly and successfully.<br />75% of the book was spent on the Final Battle.  How many horrible ways can people die before you get tired of reading about it??<br />And so finally it ended - about 14,000 pages later and only about 10 pages dedicated to the ending.  The wrapping up of this whole, long story.  Matrim sent Artur Hawkwing to talk to Tuon in person and yet not one word was written about that meeting.  Surely meeting the Hero that was the reason for the Seanchan Empire was worth a paragraph or two??  Galad lived - did he marry Berelain?  Did the Children of the Light continue or were they now considered irrelevant?  Did Mat Cauthon ever reunite with his father??  No answers, no answers, no answers.  And who was Androl really?  Did Perrin become Steward of the Two Rivers?  Or did he go with Faile when she took the throne of Saldea??  No answers.  And I guess there never will be.
B004XMMSZG|5.0|This is a fantastic product.  Works perfectly on my Bose dock,  in my car and on my Bose stereo system.  Use it with my Android phone and my Nexus tablet. Wish I had bought long ago. Buy this!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Come for the beautiful graphics and music. Stay for the interesting mixture of puzzles. I beat it in a few hours, but it was a mostly enjoyable experience even though I did curse a few times at the finicky controls. I look forward to the sequel later this year. (Purchased from The Humble Mobile Bundle and played on my Nexus 4.)
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I couldn't hardly put it down after I picked it up. It's a good dead for sure. I certainly recommend it
B00992CF6W|1.0|A stupid game no realmes dont work you have to be on the same internet to play with somebody dont buy stupid game dont like it i wont to get my money back soo bad
B003XKAZKO|5.0|If you are a fan of the Moz and/or Smiths, this is a must have. The bonus tracks are worth buying this edition, even if you already own the original release.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|been looking for this for awhile so glad I saw it here . the grand has watched it at least a thousand times. thanks
B0013LPS6Q|5.0|The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby get all the recognition and praise of the Irish quartet that are one of the best bands ever.  However, their debut album, Boy, is still one of my favorites.  The emergence of the Edge's guitar with its signature delay and chorus effects is brilliant.  Larry Mullen, Jr.'s drums are so unique, never reverting to a standard drum line, but always have a distinctive beat and heart-stopping fill at the perfect time to compliment Adam Clayton's catchy bass lines.  And, of course, there are the lyrics and unmistakable crooning of Bono.  With hits like &#34;I Will Follow&#34; and &#34;Electric Co.&#34; surrounded with U2 dire-hard fan favorites like &#34;Stories for Boys,&#34; &#34;An Cat Dubh,&#34; and &#34;Another Time, Another Place,&#34; this is a must have for any fan of '80's alternative rock.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I have absolutely loved both seasons! This one was my favorite so far!! I think Sarah Paulson is a genius, and I can't wait to see her more!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I so love how you guys added the beach it's so awesome this game is the best thing ever next to minecraft.
B005CM1ILQ|3.0|Nice addition to my movie collection. Love horror movies and this is/was one of my favs as a child. Great price.
1476727651|5.0|this is Stephen King of old, writing again! fast reading, couldn't put it down. Definetely a must read for King fans. A continuation of the best seller, The Shining.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Interesting court room dramas woven into the ongoing story line of the principle character's personal lives.  I find the series interesting and entertaining to watch.  More please...
B00E5N8DGG|5.0|I TOOK MY FIANCE FOR HER BIRTHDAY TO SEE HER FIRST DEF LEPPARD CONCERT AND MY FIRST SINCE LOS ANGELES FORUM PYROMANIA TOUR SEPT 11, 1983!!!<br />THIS SHOW WAS AMAZING, WATCHING DEF LEPPARD PERFORM HYSTERIA IN IT'S ENTIRETY WAS A DREAM COME TRUE!!! THE ONLY SONG MISSING FROM THE ENCORES WAS FOOLIN', DISAPPOINTING...<br />WATCHING DED FLATTBIRD PLAY EARLY CLASSICS WAS GREAT, TOO BAD THEY BROKE UP!!!
B000FC1MCS|5.0|Funny, sad, entertaining, with depth. Have prescribed it for reluctant teenage readers with great success each time. One of my all time favourite reads.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|I have watched this 6 times now with the grandchildren and I love it. It's wholesome and funny.  My six year old granddaughter became tearful when the dad was trapped and it appeared he would not survive  I assured her that wouldn't happen.  She was much happier during the 2nd and 3rd times she watched. it. As always, parents and/or grandparents should watch TV/movies with the kids to help with moments like that.  I highly recommend this movie to all ages.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My seven-year-old Grandson is very delighted with this awesome game!  He can't wait to share it and take turns with his little neighbor friend.  And, they both truly enjoy the game.  Thank you!!
B004H4XDBI|5.0|I loved it as much as If I Stay.....I can't wait to see the movie!  This book answered so many questions from the first one.
B00650SSDU|2.0|Mila tries hard but poor plot and JT acting drag this movie down. Will not watch this movie again or recommend it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Great book. I laughed, I cried, and I'm ready to read another book by Christine Baker Kline.<br /><br />This author literally put me in one of those seats on the train. I felt the bumps, shivered in the wind. and felt the hurt inside every child. Everybody needs to read this book and realize the life of an orphan back then and today.<br /><br />If you're ready for a novel you can't put down, Christine Baker Kline is a wonderful storyteller.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I downloaded  this application an  have only use  it for.  Week before  it automatically stops working. I'll try to open again before  I uninstall..
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|Playmobil Pirates is a cute game. The effects are awesome. I'd recommend this game to anyone that likes pirates. The game deserves 5 stars ; in my opinion.
B0046UGSNS|1.0|...and then turned it off because it was just horrible! I read the reviews provided, but I didn't see information on the amount of nudity & sexuality. Not good!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I am an Adrea Bocelli fan and this is a beautiful CD.  I especially like Quisas featuring Jennifer Lopez.  These are old classic songs an very easy listening.  Makes a beautiful gift for those who enjoy and appreciate international pop music etc.
0141439610|4.0|One of the most fun and creepy books out there. And it was written over 100 years ago! Dont let the fact that this book is a classic intimidate you. its easy to read and follow. You will not be able to put it down!
B006ATJXQW|4.0|For the most part I loved this book. Couldn't put it down. Loved finding out what was next in their journey. But the end left a bit to be desired. It was just over so fast. I guess just not what I thought I was in for in the end.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Thrills! Spills! Chills! This is an action movie and as long as you understand that I see no reason why you would not get you money's worth while watching World War Z. There are some really impressive effects and set pieces that really get the blood pumping, never mind that there is no way Brad Pitt's character would ever survive any of them. Don't think, just watch! What are you doing? You are thinking aren't you? I told you not to do that!
B000VI12ZS|4.0|Not a great deal of plot.  Story features Nicolas Cage, but not enough information regarding the windtalkers.  However, this is a  good reminder of the horrible truths of war.
B00C46QUCK|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with this album. Caro Emerald is a gem and I hope we get to see a lot more of her in the US. It's a wonderful mix of upbeat music that really gets you moving. It is fantastically elegant in an old-school, glamorous kind of way. My favorite tracks are &#34;Back it up&#34; and &#34;Dr. Wanna Do&#34;. They both have a nice beat that can't be missed. I would highly recommend to anyone who likes new music with a vintage flair.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Love this game. Great for all ages but can b very addictive. I really like the fact that you have the option to spend money but it does not impede the progress of the game if you dont.
0525953728|3.0|Interesting mainly  because it is the account of taking out OBL.  There are much more compelling and well written books about the SEALs such as Lone Survivor and Fearless.
B008JFUO4U|3.0|Ok Blu-ray.  Good plot but I could not stay with the plao.  More action needed.  Still it is a keeper for the collection.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good book. Enjoyed it very much. Can't wait to read the following book. It gives so much to think about
B001EN71CW|3.0|I wish that the DVD's were labeled as too which series was on which DVD..  You do not know.  Bad labeling.
1577314808|5.0|I read &#34;The New Earth&#34; first.  The &#34;P. of Now&#34; is part of the same mindset E. Tolle expresses in other works prior to &#34;The New Earth&#34;.<br />I especially liked Tolle's description of concsiousness in relation to the dimensions of consciousness portrayed in 'Mysticisms of East and West' as taught by the gifted teacher, Dr. Victor Danner.<br />I would only recommend readers of religious studies and meditations of the East to this book; that is, unless you are an adventurous seeker of knowledge.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Color notes works great, I have it on my phone, tablet and computer. I use it to store notes and other information.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|I like the product - the best part is the steps tracker, especially the elevation tracker.  It's nice if you are moving up stairs.<br /><br />I've found the heart monitor to be a bit erratic.  Not the best thing if you go for a run to monitor your heart rate.<br /><br />Getting replacement parts is impossible.  I've lost the sleep band and the rubbery tracker holder has already torn slightly.  No response yet from the company on how to buy replacements.  So I've stopped using the sleep monitoring feature, even though it appearted to work well for the 2 weeks I was able to use it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The book got boring! It's hard to compete with her previous two books, how entertaining they became and grabbed the audience's attention with suspense, but at one point, I was about to put the book down. I was also very disappointed with the ending, not like every author should have a happy ending like Twilight, but at least an ending where I can go to sleep not unsettled and feeling like the whole series was a waste. Don't get me wrong, I love the hunger Games series and the characters and all, but in the end, it seemed like she got tired of writing and didn't want to make up a future for at least half of the characters she created. I understood the purpose of killing Prim, to end the story where it started, but there were a ton of unnecessary deaths, like Finnick and Boggs. And what about Peeta? Shouldn't the audience get the satisfactory that his mind is fixed and they can settle with the character the fell in love with in the first place?
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book! Make sure to read speaker for the dead and Enders shadow. Enjoyed this book even more since I have read the other<br />books.
0307931803|5.0|Always a winner! Kids love being read to and more so when the person reading has to work to get the words out. Love the tweedle beetle battle with noodles on a poodle. Read it faster and faster and the kids will erupt into laughter.
B003RUZKC8|4.0|Never heard of this movie, but saw it on Amazon. With Jeffrey Dean Morgan in it, you can't go wrong.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Intriguing at times, enjoyable, and easy to read.  Not quite up to some of his other works, and I guess I kept waiting for something profound to be sprung at me, but, oh well.  Still I am very glad to have read this, and I look forward to more from Mr Albom. The profound surprise may be there, and I just missed it.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|Listen to Voyeur, Can't Stay Alone Tonight, Oscar Wilde Gets Out and Home Again. Listen a second time. In my opinion, those are the best tracks (especially Can't Stay Alone & Voyeur). The album highlights the songwriting genius of Bernie Taupin and the musical adaption acumen of Elton. The entire album takes me back (mostly) to the early Elton albums (Self-Titled, Madman Across The Water & Tumbleweed Connection) but there are glimpses of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Reg Strikes Back, Peachtree Road and Songs From The West throughout. Listen again. This is beautiful, eloquent music from Elton, one of his best. Thank you, Sir.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Awesome! Good Action, funny, and very entertaining. Finally a movie that I can enjoy and have given as a gift to many people. No one has told me that they didn't love it
B00B52F278|5.0|A great series and great actors. I loved the story and it has kept me on edge. If you have the time look into it. You will be hooked from episode 1
B00000JNOJ|4.0|Not only is this a classic blues album and the singing is great, the recording quality is one of the best I have heard.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very easy to use this ap. Multiple translations at your finger tips. A must have for your phone, tablet, or computer.
B003L5BRXK|5.0|Top notch RS album. To be honest they have never had a bad album.  But I may be somewhat the wrong person to ask.
B004JP5DHW|5.0|Just a great movie a great insight to how people treat handicap people in America. It is such a good movie
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Love this cd, I Will Wait is my fav song right now.  Be sure to buy it and listen to it TODAY!
B009LDD1X0|5.0|it's a good show everyone should be seeing it a funny show for sure I have all the other years and like seeing them once I have time too
B000W4RFHK|5.0|Great book! My most favorite piece by kerouac. It has a more spiritual outlook on the American life at the time.
B007L6VR12|5.0|first I enjoy Bruce Willis he was very good in this movie plus I enjoyed the movie very much I do at times think it could make more of these a good movie to see
0451531051|5.0|This book is great to introduce or reintroduce poetry and short stories to adolescents and adults. It is a classic.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|One of the best movies I saw this year! Keeps you guessing til the end! I pre-ordered it because I knew I needed to have it!!!
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Wow, after reading some of the negative reviews of this edition, I felt like I should write my own review...  I found this book to be quite charming as it follows the main character, Maggie, on the search for her sister's killer.  And wouldn't we all love to have a charming Frenchman like Laurent, who is not only easy on the eyes but also a great personal chef, come along and sweep us off our feet?<br />Luckily last night was a Friday night and I didn't have to work today so I was able to read to the end all at one time.  I would have had a hard time putting it down otherwise, due to the suspense of discovering the identity of the killer.<br />The Kindle edition is free, so give it a try.  If you don't like it you can easily delete it.
0897502027|5.0|If you are interested in Jeet Kune Do or Bruce Lee, this is a great place to start.  Read this book.
B000FC1PNE|4.0|Enjoyed this sweet romance. Julia Quinn always creates such likeable characters, and this book is no exception. A nice piece of the Bridgerton series.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|this movie keeps you guessing until the end; it does not give anything away; when you think you have it figured out, a new twist appears; great visuals
0399226907|5.0|...and now my one year old does too! This is a genuine classic that should be on every child's book shelf. We bought the version with the caterpillar soft toy, they both shouted with recognition when they first saw it but to be honest it's the counting, the progression from left to right and the ultimate double page transformation to (spoiler alert) a butterfly that wins them over every time.<br /><br />A true classic!
B00BX8PG4S|5.0|Ed Harris and David Duchovny are great as adversaries in this jewel of a movie.<br />It keeps you interested until the end AND it is based on facts...
B00CMQX84A|5.0|I bought this for my son's birthday. It reminded me of the old beach movies. It was nice to watch something that didn't have violence in it. Loved the songs and dancing.
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|I was not familiar with the Jack Reacher books, so I did not know what to expect.<br />This movie is good entertainment, but not Tom Cruise's best work....
B00632HWOG|2.0|No option to log out. My friend checked her email and I kept getting alerts until I uninstalled it. VERY annoying! It would be better if you could log out and sign in different accounts - and STOP with the notifications every ten minutes.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Best riff on the Star Trek \\"space western\\" concept.  Engaging, well written, thought-provoking funny and short lived on broadcast.  Earth is only a memory, but the descendants are still fighting civil wars, producing authoritarian regimes and heroic criminals, and dodging the Reevers.  Who can resist the mix of space, cowboys and zombies?
B00942Y4IY|4.0|I still remember watching this movie in the theater for the first time.  20 years later, it doesn't seem quite as cool, but the special effects here were pretty memorizing at the time..  Considering the franchise this film watched, it makes for a nice 90's Sci-Fi flick.  It's funny to go back and look at Kurt Russell's bad acting, while also seeing James Spader just coming into his own as a great actor.
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|It took a bit of time to get into the characters and style,but after that it became an engrossing an complexed tale. When I finished I wanted to read more books by the author.
B008ODZUN2|1.0|Rachel Weisz is a great actress....but the pace here is just TOO SLOW.  I thought the premise sounding interesting, but the dreadfully slow pace takes that all way. There are plenty of movies with a slow and delicate plot that are nevertheless still engaging, but this ain't one of 'em!  I quit watching this thing about 1/2 way through.  Sorry, Rachel....I really want to like you in this one! :(
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very well written. The author kept the reader in suspense until the very last pages. even after! I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys crime drama.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I was given this book by Multnomah in exchange for my honest review of the book.<br />I have been trying to read more books that might appeal to men lately.  I have two sons and a husband and thus live around men.  I thought by reading a few books written to appeal to men I might gain more understanding.  What I did not expect was that this book does not only appeal to men...it is appealing to women as well.<br />The fact that the office of the Navy Seals did put their seal of approval on the book, and they do not usually endorse books about their organization, also intrigued me.<br />it is about a young man Adam Brown.  I learned about who he was as a child, as a teen, the difficulties he went through and overcame and how the Lord Jesus became his Strength and his Hope.<br />I learned how he worked his way up to becoming a Navy SEAL.  That was very interesting to me.<br />The title \\"Fearless\\" truly described this man and his way of living.<br />It is an inspiring book and I believe anyone would enjoy reading it but especially if you are military.<br />This is one of my favorite quotes from the book that describes Adam:<br />\\" Adam's devout Christian faith matched his toughness and fearlessness.  It was the cornerstone upon which he built his life and the compass that he turned to for guidance.  To truly live one's faith, in word and deed, is a mighty, and a daily, struggle; and Adam embraced that struggle and devoted himself to it. \\"<br />His story is one of overcoming addictions also which makes it very powerful and inspiring for others going through the same thing in life.  Highly recommend.
0671646788|5.0|I first read this book years ago, when I was beginning my career in ministry, and recently re-read it, since success in ministry seems to be greatly dependent on personality variables and the ability to master oneself as much as influencing others.  The central theme of this book is that your attitudes, how you think about yourself, others and the problems you face will predict your success of failure in life, and how happy and fulfilled you are.  In short, the \\"battleground of life\\" is within yourself, not - so much - in the external environment.<br /><br />I chuckled reading that one of the unrealized dreams at the time of the publication of this book, in 1959, was the hope of building an underground roadway from Europe to England, beneath the English Channel. What seemed like an \\"impossible dream\\" in 1959 is a reality in 2013. The Chunnel is one of the great engineering feats of the last decade, brought about by those who understood the \\"magic of thinking big\\"!
0399255370|5.0|Bought 3 copies for the elementary school and a couple of neighbor children.  They enjoyed it, and so did I.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book,it was  interesting all the way to the end It was a love story and a mystery  I loved it !!I would recommend this book to anyone !!!
0525952926|5.0|I reread The Fall of Giants, book one, of this Trilogy, so I could be in sinc with &#34; the Winter of the Word&#34;.  Ken Follett is the best, even at 1000 pages.
0316228583|5.0|I had expected a good story from Rowling, but I found this more than just an interesting tale. It's moving and even tragic.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Reading this book was such a breath of fresh air. Austin manages to cram an amazing amount of hard-earned wisdom and inspiration into a short book that can (and should) be read over and over again.<br /><br />One of my favorite aspects is how it explodes the myth that great art arrives from nowhere, descending on you like manna from heaven. He shows that it requires work, dedication, frustration, and a little creative theft.<br /><br />Bottom line: it belongs on any artist, writer, or even businessperson's bookshelf.
B0088X7YMS|1.0|What the heck is wrong with the sound on this CARTOON?  I'm confuses, it sounds like the voice actors called it in via cellphones.  This is a terrible movie and horrible exploitation of the STARSHIP TROOPERS fanchise.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig brings it all home and into focus with this Bond outing. It finally explains so much about James Bond the person, his early life, his past, and what haunts him. The story is superb, the action (what else-its Bond). It delves into the folds of the longtime characters; deeper, intriguing, and very well acted. Daniel Craig is the Bond that Ian Fleming wrote about; to a tee. This is well done. if I could give it six stars, I would.
B008Y212PI|4.0|lots of fun. gets you thinking. would be better if actually making picture not just the outline. addicting though. needs more color
B007QPFGJW|3.0|I did not care for the premise of the novel. Drug dealing and junkies are not what I enjoy about these novels.<br />Nesbo's writing and phrasing is great, Just didn't enjoy this one as much as others I have read.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This movie is visually stunning and emotionally heartbreaking. The lead actors both do an amazing job of showing the depth of their emotional pain, unrelated to their physical injuries. On first watch you may miss all the important references made in the opening scene; on a second viewing you see more and it all pulls together in a really elegant way. Although much of the tale takes place in an early 20th century hospital, this is not a horror story of old fashioned medicine, and the American settings are as beautiful as some of the exotic locations.<br />Most of all this movie is sad. Very sad. But not like a movie about a dog where you KNOW it is going to die at the end; the sadness is subtle and creeps up on you. The actual DVD was good quality and looks stunning in high def.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun game pretty easy to play. li think each level should have a few more things to do before you can move on.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|More explosions and gory violence brings to mind the current cinema obsession. Spoken of course by a grandma. Still it was an engaging portrayal of \\"absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\"
B004C3DLJS|5.0|Classic Disney movie. Love it. The kids always enjoy watching toy story over and over again. Adults can enjoy as well
1449408656|5.0|i love her art and humor. plus, its about cats, perfect!! i can not wait to get her new book!

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is soothing! Even though it's intended for children, I really enjoy playing the game to relieve stress. The graphics are great
B00DSTBMMU|4.0|This is not a typical Sheryl Crow album.  Don't get me wrong, I love Sheryl Crow and if she did an album covering Opera Standards, I'd buy it and talk about how it was a bold departure from her typical body of work. However, I went into this album unknowing and unaware of anything save for her previous body of work. The last was a compilation of Soul Standards, which was also a departure from her usual.  I've had the pleasure to see her in concert after her recovery from breast cancer and before that when she guested with Stevie Nicks when she'd produced her album. She is an amazing talent and show woman.<br /><br />This is an excellent album, but make no mistake: It's a country album, through and through. With lines like &#34;Thank God for waterproof mascara, because it doesn't run like his daddy did.&#34; Great country line, but vastly unexpected from the queen of Rock and Roll. Her voice and lyrics wrap around the ideas and themes of country music as easily as a bow around a brightly colored package on Christmas Day. The music is solid, the record is definitively Sheryl Crow, but she's experimenting. She has, of course, proven her chops as a Rock/Pop artist. She has established herself as a competent interpreter of R & B and Soul Standards. Now she is channeling her considerable talents into the realm of country music.<br /><br />Now when I say country music, I utilize my Granny's definition of Country Music, which is &#34;Real Country Music tells a story.&#34;  That fully explains &#34;Waterproof Mascara.&#34; She lends herself easily to tracks like &#34;Nobody's Business&#34; and &#34;Crazy Ain't Original.&#34; &#34;Easy&#34; is a hard times love song that makes a &#34;Stay-Cation&#34; sound like a dream vacation, and is likely to put a smile on even the most hardcore Sheryl Crow fan. She twangs without being twangy. She works the conventions of country music without making them into cliches, and in the process, manages to turn out something that is both freshand familiar.<br /><br />As I said at the start, I didn't go into this with the idea that I was purchasing a country album.  I wasn't disappointed, but I was surprised. The first listen through I was iffy, the second, I was hooked.  Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna grab my Stetson and boots, and put on &#34;Feels Like Home.&#34;
B001JIDE3M|4.0|Journey to the Center of the Earth is a great movie.  Brendan Fraser at his best.  I recommend this movie to everyone.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|All the characters grew emotionally. Especially moved by the changing language of the young girl as she matured & became more confident, more worldly.
B00B89LZ4C|4.0|The sculpting on the figure is very close to the likeness of the character. The packaging kind of hinders you from seeing the full effect by putting a clear plastic piece over the figures face. I assume to keep the figure from moving around in the package. But if you're going to actually take it out of the package there's no issue about that.<br />It comes with the famous hat. Sunglasses and a bag of money. A barrel would have been cooler but this came out before those episodes.<br />Could McFarlane have made a better figure? Probably, but thus us still pretty cool.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I was not expecting this book to be good due to the price but I was impressed. Will buy more like thr re buy. Wol buy more.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|Very easy to use, I would recommend this app to friends and family.  I think it is fabulous can't get enough of it. I highly recommend everyone to purchase this app at 3.99. This is a Great Bargain!
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|Dumb ways to die is a great game,but the worst part is that there are a lot of adds and the video is really Funny you should get this game
B00BUGABLQ|5.0|The title says it all. I bought this set for the bonus tracks and the TRY! album which I didn't own. iTunes wanted $14.99 for the deluxe version of Battle Studies, which is the only other legal way to get &#34;I'm On Fire&#34;, so why not get them in hard copy. Same for the rest of his albums up to that point.
B00FEN000S|5.0|This movie didn't get the attention it deserved in the theatres. The origin of the kaiju and the jaegars along with the two pilot system is explained in the movie. Transformers and independence day wished it were this cool!
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|This movie was very creepy. I was jumpy from the very begining all the way until the conclusion. I would not let children watch this movie because of the ways people die in the movie. There was a good plot of the movie and some thought was brought into the deaths it not just another thriller movie. I love this movie and highly recommend it for adults and older teens.
0345803485|2.0|I guess I expected too much considering all the reviews.  This book is definitely not for everyone.  I am not a prude, but I found parts very disturbing.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I loved every second of the help. This movie captures you from the beginning and keeps you until the end. The storyline is amazing and its very different from the normal &#34;racism&#34; movie. The actresses and actors did a very great job in this movie. I recommend this movie for teens and adults.
