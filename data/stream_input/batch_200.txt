B0082BB0SA|5|Love it!
B001BAG38G|5|This is one of my favorite scents to wear any time of the day. I find it fresh, clean, inviting and mellow as the day goes on. You will find that this cologne lasts all day which is another reason why I absolutely recommend and love it. If your looking for a clean, sophisticated manly man scent, then Le Male is the one for you.
B00NWAIHHS|5|Great product. Much better than the any of the drug store eye-lash curlers sitting in my drawer un-used. I love the tweezers that came with it too.
B000IOOJWI|5|My dermatologist told me to use these. I am 63 & still have plugged pores. My dermatologist told me to use these every other day & they are not too harsh on my skin. I continue to use Retin-A also & still not overly dry. My skin now seems to take the moisturizer better (if that makes any sense). I have been using these for about a month & I'm starting to see improvement. My pores look clearer & smaller.
B00BT1TFKA|1|I Had To Give It A One Star Just Cause It Doesnt Let  Give Zero , This Hair Stayed Good For A Few Days ,  If You Wear Extensions Or Sew-ins Like Wearing Hair For A Long Period Of Time Then This Is Not The Hair For You , The Hair Silky ,Straight , Beautiful But After A Few Days It Gets Nasty Feels And Just Feels Like It Needs A Wash If Your Going To Wear ThisFor A Week Or Less Than This Is For You Its bad Dont  Me Wrong It Just doesn't Last .
B00R6P72JO|5|This item truly works just like the nail salons. It is pretty sharp and gets rid of calluses and rough spots. Great item for the price.
B003MUYUU6|5|I recieved this perfume for my birthday in February and have loved it ever since! This is a great price and was delivered quickly!
B00IW6S7W2|2|Didn't like them... wont stay on very well and they are hard to take off, and look more like tomatoes than strawberries.
B0081MQ47C|5|Good product.  It works as advertised.  I am very pleased with it.
B000MAK1SE|5|The pill box is a good product.  Easy to open and stays closed when you need it to. The compartments are a bit small for my clumsy fingers. I would recommend.
B000GIOBY2|5|Was exactly as advertised. Fast Delivery! Thanks.
B001T8JM5Q|3|I've just started using it - this is VERY important, and amazon fails to mention it - the cream has a warning on the back of it strictly saying that it has chemicals within the cream that are known to cause birth defects AND reproductive harm. So use it at your own will, but I feel like the majority of people have missed that note on the back of the cream. Honestly, it looks a little sketchy to me, but other then that it's OKAY. Has a strong smell, and have to apply it on thicker then what I thought. Won't buy again
B00DTDKWWG|4|I absolutely love the look of this. It's easy to clip in and stays well.  I wanted to add some color to my hair but was too chicken to permanently dye it just yet, and this was the perfect solution.  I clip it in on days I want to add purple, and either put it in a pony or braid, and I love the accent color.  I've had no issues with tangling or frizzing.  My only complaint is in comfort - a few of the clips are uncomfortable no matter where I clip it in.  The middle ones are fine, the outside ones kind of pinch.  I've tried different locations and positions, hair up and down, and the outside ones tug.
B005IMHCII|3|Not ouchless. Better than most but still uncomfortable after awhile.
B00FIZGLRI|5|When Head and Shoulders released a line of conditioners a few years back, I decided to give the shampoos/conditioners a try. I have long, dark brown hair ... and even a single flake stands out all too clearly. And, while I do not use Head and Shoulders \\"regularly,\\" I do use it in winter months (when the air becomes dry from artificial heat) and year-round after long workout sessions (for some reason, it gives me the feeling of really clean hair).    When I first tried these, I was astonished that they made women's hair so soft, so bouncy, so shiny! The same remains true today. While these products seem somewhat synonymous with \\"men,\\" they are just phenomenal for women's hair as well (and, I know that P&G has been trying to change the perception of Head and Shoulders as a men's product).    Like all the Head & Shoulders conditioners, this one is luxurious in thickness, smells great, rinses clean (with ease) and leaves GORGEOUS hair. I even use this set when I feel like there is a \\"build-up\\" on my hair from other products. Now, don't get me wrong, it does not \\"strip\\" hair ... it just leaves it really clean and super well conditioned.    Head and Shoulders is (by far) the best line for dandruff treatment that there is. (It is all my father uses ... it is all that my boyfriend uses ... and even I use it on occasion). Invest your trust here. You cannot go \\"wrong\\" with Head and Shoulders.
B00HWPB7RG|1|I am very unhappy ..  I have been waiting for some instructions on this machine.
B0096MIQAE|5|I use one of these 40 Blinks masks every night. They're wonderful I have a very small face, and they fit me well. Totally block the light.
B000V6MZ4C|5|I really enjoyed it! Works perfectly for exercising wrist, hand and all its muscles! I do recommend this product to anyone.
B00ICXMI8Y|5|I love this stuff! I use it on my hair, face, and body. I have fine hair so it gets greasy easily, but it does not with this. It makes my hair silky smooth and protects it from heat. It's also great on my skin and does not make me break out. Love it!
B000NGH3X8|5|It's the greatest rapid spray dry.. You can actually touch after you spray ..smudge less..it's remarkable ..it's a rapid dry..
B000N758A2|5|Smells great. My hair has never been softer. I think I need to buy the shampoo and conditioner for it too because I am in love with this product!
B004X1QY20|1|I took a foundation class at sephora and wanted to get a setting spray like I had used there. I put on my makeup like usual without the spray for a few days while waiting for this to arrive and my makeup was fine during that time. Then I started using the spray and noticed that after an hour or so my makeup would start to conjeal and even drip down my face a bit. I thought maybe I sprayed it on wrong so after a few different attempts I stopped using it and my makeup went back to staying fresh looking for many hours again. This might be find for light makeup but when using a full face of foundation, concealer, etc it just ruined it all. Very bummed.
B0054Y2EY2|5|I used it for a soft looking gel and it does not leave hair dry and brittle looking.You put it on after the you shampoo and leave it in..I have thin hair and it really leaves it bouncy..
B00AN9CHY0|5|Great product  !!!!!
B0095IUQK2|5|Gives me such great volume and healthier than ratting my hair. Love it!!!
B00594TJU4|2|I was looking for something similar to Spiritual Sky's Amber perfume oil, which I love, but was disappointed. This smelled really strongly of cheap incense upon applying and had a sickeningly sweet dry-down that was more like sugary vanilla than amber. It's not too bad if I only wear a little and if I mixit with other perfume to balance out the cloying smell, but I probably won't buy from this brand again.
B0013C5HNY|4|I did not give it five stars because the pump is impossible to release so one has to unscrew the top to use.
B0011E2RTQ|5|Great stuff!  I got a sample at a Health Fair and it worked on my dry skin.  Had to order some.
B000H740DE|1|I love Facial Fuel, it's an excellent moisturizer and I've been using it for years: I rate it on a par with Biotherm's, which is almost impossible to find in the USA.<br /><br />So, the product itself, gets a 5-star.<br /><br />However, the pricing here is a complete scam: on Kiehl's own site [...] you can get a 4.8oz for the price of this 2.5oz, and they even offer free shipping above $50 (the shipping charges on this item are also a real rip-off).<br />The 2.5oz is around $20<br /><br />Avoid.
B003RF82UK|4|pretty refeshing<br />not hydraing for oily skin
B006K3UTXY|1|It didn't fit, so I stretched out the wire to hang it over the side of my tub. It wouldn't hold very well, so I tied it to the faucet. After banging my leg into it on my way out of the tub, I threw it out. It's huge, ugly, and it's a waste of money. I went to ikea, bought a corner shelf, and I use that to hold everything.
B004D2DR0Q|5|We have many sunscreen bottles in our house - sport, baby, sensitive skin, spray. Neutrogena Ultra Sheer is my favorite out of all of them. I use it on my body and face. I applies easily and feels like regular lotion once rubbed in. I will always have this on hand.
B009PIJLMQ|5|Great
B008VP8EMM|2|One size fits all really doesn't fit most
B006E3STSM|1|I have used two tubes and have not seen any improvement in dark circles or wrinkles. In fact, I think my eyes are more droopy than before.
B00158J0EI|5|Easy to use and last for a long time. Much cheaper then going to a dentist with the same results
B000S1TFPW|5|You are so right M. Miller.  I can now walk into any Target store and buy this product for $19.00!!!
B0061OWBP6|5|I never had long nails until I started using OPI products.  Highly recommend them, especially the ORIGINAL NAIL ENVY.  Works like magic.
B002RS6JPI|5|Sexy Hair Big Sexy Blow Dry Volume Gel gives my hair the exact volume I need to give my hair a volume that last for days.  It is not sticky and heavy like most gels.  I highly recomment it.
B000068PBT|2|I have been using Norelco shavers for many years and still believe them to be the best of the electric shavers, but recently the heads just do not seem to hold there sharpness. Years ago I could get over a year an sometimes even two years out of a set of heads. Recently after 6 months they are already loosing there sharpness. In fact this is the second time I ordered these heads from Amazon this year. Amazon's price is the best around but even here the price of replacement heads is ridiculous.
B00RNADLQK|5|This is not an overnight fix. Like it says, take it for about 6 months to really see results. I have been taking it for about 7 months now, so I figured it was time to write mt review. I still have grays, however, I have noticed probably about a 50% reduction in the amount of grays I have already. I am hoping it will continue to transform my gray hairs as I continue taking it, but either way, I am already happy with the results and will continue to take it to maintain, if not improve my hair color going forward. I know seven months is a long time to wait and be diligent about taking these, but completely worth it!
B005IVZ19G|5|I bought it as a Christmas gift for my sister, and she says she absolutely loves the fragrance and how it makes her skin feel.
B000VS6JQA|2|SMALL!! I did not expect it to be so small and it was dissapointing, luckily the person getting it wasnt too picky and she needed a makeup box.
B003O7CR98|3|No instruction in English, when to use the mask: before or after shampooing.<br />For the product imported from another country, it is necessary to have some.
B00384YBE6|5|I like 1 Million!!!
B009LLDAK6|5|These heads are exactly the same as those found in the store but are easier to get.  They work great and last longer than suggested.
B001BAL7EG|3|I've tried the red Nag Champa's, and have decided that I like the gold ones way better. These leave a lingering smell that it not too pleasant.
B001J6O0YG|5|No problems. Fast shipping, great prices (the best I could find online!) and good quality.. Will definitely order from this company again..  PS don't order from videodirect.com - I had so many problems with this company and the same product was only a little cheaper and their customer service is absolutely HORRIBLE!
B001EO5WZE|4|I've been using this for 2 years now and I love it.  No frizz, nice defined yet soft curls.  It's a battle finding a good product for curly hair and this one is it!
B00H2WIKCE|5|Perfect!
B00HG4NZN2|5|Perfect
B000WZSY60|5|Bought it for my girlfriend this Christmas and it's amazing! Not too strong or overpowering. Classy, subtle scent. Much prefer this to the newer versions
B00HW7OVCC|5|Nice size for the price!  It was very gentle on my skin and I didn't have any dryness when used with a very light, oil-free moisturizer.  My skin looks and feels terrific!
B0013NBW5A|2|Way too shimmery for my taste.unfortunately, I think I'm a bit too mature for that whole Sparkly look. It's just to for me.
B00CQSZVVM|5|This is a great summer bag for a great price!  Only wish the straps were bigger to wear on my shoulder!
B008B9QRQI|3|I bought this as a companion to the duffel bag with the same print. It makes a fun set, but the make up pouch is very expensive for what it is. It is super simple, no compartments and I am no sure how it will last.
B005HJTTM4|2|I bought these thinking that it was such a great deal, so many templates so many choices. But, was disappointed. My daughters tried to use them and found the templates were way too shallow. The templates do not hold nail polish to allow the stamps to pick up polish. The engravings are way too shallow. We bought this and cannot use them. Some templates are almost flush with the metal plate.
B001ET783I|5|great product highly recommend
B0002F1UX4|1|Ok, maybe I am using it wrong but I did exactly what the bottle said and also what my beautician told me to do.  I had dried my hair and it was so cute.  I wanted to give it a full messy look so I flipped my head over and sprayed and scrunched my hair.  It felt so gross and sticky, kind of synthetic!  I had to wash my hands and then wanted to wash my hair but I didn't have any time.  My hair felt so stick most of the day.  I didn't like the way it looked or felt and I will be bringing it back.   I thought maybe once it dried it would feel better but it did not.  I also felt like my hair looked dirty.  Never again.    I have thick hair with a little bend that is cut just below the chin in a mod bob.
B002WUCR48|5|I read about this product in a magazine and decided to try it.  I have used it was very pleased with the results.
B00FRYHIQI|5|I have had a hard time finding this item anywhere. I suffer from pleurisy and the pressure and support the body shaper provides helps me to live with a little less pain which is always good.
B00N2WQ2IW|4|I've used Pantene products before with reasonable success. This conditioner works well (though no miracles should be expected) and, importantly for me, smells fine with a reasonably faint scent. While I've just tried it once, it looks like this will be a good conditioner for me.
B001CT079C|5|I recommend it arrived all well greetings from Venezuela.
B00B7W8VPQ|1|I like the smell of real coconut, but this is that fake smelling perfumey coconut scent like in things from Bath and Body Works. It was overpowering and I didn't notice any benefits to the look or feel of my hair.
B000V5OQNG|4|I've used this color for the past 15 years, and I've enjoyed the texture, quality, and color every time.  Difficult to find, often sold out, and there is a good reason for that.  It is a great neutral shade that goes on lighter than the tube photo shows, which is more of a medium color.  Not too dark, not too light.  My friends use this and we are mature women with mature skin.  Back in the day when I used to still tan, it also looked great, but it also does well with fair to medium skin tones.  I no longer tan my face, and this gives my pale lips lots of color without washing out my white with freckles face! I find the color is flattering with most everything I wear except orange and warm reds, which is not in my wardrobe.<br />My color is considered to be between Summer and Winter (Color Me Beautiful book)and that basically means I usually wear the cool colors, not the warm ones. I don't find it to be super long lasting, but I actually prefer that. It feels great on my lips, and I don't mind reapplying it after eating.  Taste is nothing special.  I generally don't notice any lipstick taste, unless I'm using a flavored fruit type of lip balm, so not sure what other reviewers were expecting it to taste like. Hope that helps someone decide which colors they want.  One other add: I bought this on a subscription delivery schedule, but I noticed that it has increased to over $2 more than last month. That was disappointing. I'll be keeping an eye on that before I order it again.
B0018L6V6C|5|I spray this all over my clothes, jacket, scarf, before leaving the house and frequently receive compliments.  This is a very clean scent and very light so you can truly mist it all over and not have it overdone.
B00GXFS6U2|5|Love the quality of this oil so far!
B003CE8BAW|1|It came half full...it leaked...why can't packaging be better sent back question are got no response to it ...sad ..
B007BLN17K|1|My daughters bought these brushes with some of their own precious earned money.  They are junk and almost immediately fell apart
B002KFOX38|4|This is a great cream for your eyes for the day - you see nearly instant results, and it does last all day.  However, I wouldn't call this a truly replenishing cream over time.  You really have to start over each day.  But for the effect, it's worth it.
B00DPE9EQO|5|I love all the OZ Naturals products!  I switched from a  high end brand and I am more please with the results of Oz Natural's Vitamin C Serum and their other products.  My skin looks noticably smoother and feels fantastic.  I am actually excited to use my Oz Natural products everyday!
B004B7KKO4|5|I love this flat iron.  it also curls.  I have very very think coarse hair and other tools don't work.  THis one does.  It's awesome
B001H9289Y|5|Glad to find this - haven't been able to find it in stores.  Great cover for dark circles under my eyes. Doesn't clump in fine lines, light coverage
B0068OAL2E|5|Smells a lot like Essential Faith oil, just $40-$50 cheaper. I luv the roll-on oils, it's paraben free, no chemicals.
B004L18FY2|4|I had a sew-in in my hair for about two months and washing my hair afterwards I felt a HUGE relief. But the shampoo did leave my hair feeling dry but I suppose that was because it wasn't the sulfate free one. But I used the deep conditioner and left that in my hair for an hour before rinising it out. And with the leave-in conditioner I applied that when I was doing my braid out. It left my hair feeling soft and looking healthy. None of the products felt heavy on my hair or like it was weighing it down. And the serum add additional gloss finish when I took my braids out. I gave it a four because of the size. I have really thick hair so I use more than I would prefer but when this is about done I'll get the Sulfate Free Shampoo, Deep Conditioner and Leave In Conditioner in the liter sizes. I really like this product.
B008JVZMDM|5|I love these brushes. They are extremely soft and so cute. They came 5 days earlier than expected. The carrying case is also a plus. I am in love with these brushes !!!!
B001H270RQ|5|This was the best buy iv ever done. It dries supper fast literally inly took 2-3 minutes
B00H4BOME8|4|this is going to be my cream for now
B006XJ0Y0I|2|I tried this henna after using Lush's red henna bricks, and chemical dyes prior to that. I was initially really put off by the color and tried to fade it as much as possible.  It came out an extremely vibrant purple/red that lasted for a week. After no success at fading it myself, a week or two later  it settled into the color I had hoped it would. The worst thing about this henna is that it bleeds CONSTANTLY, or at least it did on my hair. I couldn't really find any solution to that online either. So every time I took a shower, went swimming, and even got sweaty my hair would bleed orange/yellow. If you're looking for a subtle auburn red and do not want to wait for it to fade, then you should probably try something else. However, I wouldn't recommend this product based on the bleeding quality alone.
B00QT14EB0|3|Ok but not that easy to peel off
B000TCD51A|4|Nickel
B0050PRDPA|5|Smells like you walked out of a barbershop and holds pretty much all day with no nasty drip or grease like other gels. Only way to find out is to try it and take my word for it.
B00AAAWJ4K|5|Only thing I found that works on my unwanted spots.
B0066DC68Y|5|Decent product and the best price I could find on the internet
B004P7AXOW|5|Buying again! The smell is great and lasts longer than other brands.
B00OIF4GPS|1|It's to short and want fit around my neck.
B00F4TXSAG|4|Aventus clone?  Yes. Good YES!!!!!
B00FYZZWQS|3|it is okay, I have better I think.  again it is not a soft enough or pliable enough  rubber for my happiness
B004U6TP74|3|i have been on this product for months & my acne looks exactly the same there has not been any improvments whatsoever. i keep spending my money to buy this product and it has not done anything for my skin i don't know whether to give up on it or just keep trying..
B008J54PQ8|3|Packaging is so cute!! Definitely as described and came when expected. Was nice sealed and carefully packed. The color is great for my skin but it does smell a bit flowery and also makes my skin feel dry. It would be great to use when your skin is really oily. Not sure if it's non comodogenic though because nothing on it is in English. Overall I'm pleased. And for the price you can't beat it.
B004NEHR28|5|Nice little block, good quality.
B001KYRZG2|5|Love it but it's way cheaper in Walmart
B00FFW8QTU|4|could be smoother like the hot pink version, but good none the less.
B000OTZLFG|5|I gave Inis a five star review because it is my favorite scent.  I have been using only Inis for the past few years because I love the clean, light smell that is not overpowering and yet smells so fresh and intriguing.  I use only a small amount but I always receive very complimentary remarks about it and others ask what it is I am wearing.
B00HIDT94U|4|This is a very nice brush set and carrying case.
B000BLKYWM|5|Works for me, ideal for small hands.
B00HXOC1BM|2|Sorry Life cell but it's over rated!! People with sensitive eyes will possibly get red and dark irritated under their eyes from this new product. I guess it might help with lines??? But the redness is no good! And making my eyes look darker I don't like. It's in my refrigerator now and I am going to try it cold, see if that makes a difference???? Hummm....--- All my life I've been a high dollar shopper and had to have the best and most expensive products out there. But I have learned through the years and trial and error that you can find some pretty darn good products at Walmart and target, CVS, the lower inexpensive lines YES! believe it or not, I have fought it time and time again. But it is the truth!!! The metal tip applicator is just a gimmick! I've seen it before on products. Silly, doesn't make a difference in how the product works....Life Cell is just really really marketing their products right now and have been, and people like myself buy it! Because it &#34;sounds&#34; so good. Remember, sensitive eyes, dark circles? Walmart, Loreal it's in a white pot eye cream for dark circles and puffyness, it's a winner, top and underneath the eye both. Skin Cell you can only put underneath the eye. And the other one has caffine in it also. which is good.
B00A84H1I2|5|Love it, even works in the warm weather, I never get tired of this color change polish. I would recommend to anyone
B00D3OOPGK|5|my close friend gave it to me as a gift and I so much adore the scent and how it moisturizes my hands.  will buy it when am out.
B000UVZU1S|4|The price was very nice so I decided to try it. The key is to not really rub it thoroughly into your skin. It dries to quickly. I have very dry skin on my face. Not like flaking pieces, but feels tight or dry especially during the winter. So I just put some on my finger tips and push it into the skin. especially under my eyes. I keep a light thin coating on it to really seal my skin. It smells great and I even put a dab on my 12 month old who had a patch of dry skin on her arm...worked great. I can appreciate the amount you get too. All around I am happy.
B00KY7524S|5|I've had a red spot on my face for months from a systic breakout that never emerged and just lingered and hurt for weeks. It left a scar like red spot on my cheek forever. It has diminished almost completely since I've been using this! I can't live without this product!
B00L2XRFXO|2|Ok not what I expected
B009GIOVKC|2|I would not buy this product again. It broke after 6 months. It's worth it to spend more money and get a Clarisonic.
B00161JIJ6|5|None of the Smashbox Brow Tech colors is exactly right for me, so I use a different brand of product, but the brush is the bomb!<br /><br />I love the long handle, which makes it easy to control, the angle is perfect, and the bristles are very stiff, which means it can handle any width brow.  This brush provides consistent results, and is superior to any other brow brush I've tried.  It's expensive, yes, but I've been using the same one for 10+ years which averages out to be pretty cheap!
B005WKJB6C|5|Smells scrumptious and helps alleviate dry skin!
B0057W0N5I|5|My mom love them
B00325D0WK|1|I was looking for a cheaper option to Latisse, which I've used before and loved (was just looking for a cheaper option.)  After just one night of using this stuff, my eyelids turned all red and itchy.  I tried it for 3 nights and it got so bad, I had to stop using it.  I will be going back to Latisse.  Maybe I just had an allergic reaction - really wish this had worked for me...
B00RSBH5G6|5|I actually prefer sample vials of perfume to full-size bottles for the following reasons:    1) I like to try lots of different perfumes and small vials are the most economical way to do this;  2) I switch it up often so my nose doesn't become too used to what I'm wearing and I can't smell it anymore;  3) I wear perfumes according to mood and don't ever really want a \\"signature scent.\\"  That would be too boring/limiting.  :-)  4) In order not to offend anyone else who might be sensitive to scent, I wear only a modest spritz on each wrist so a sample vial can last me at least a dozen uses or more; and  5) Almost all of my perfume fragrances are \\"blind buys\\" so this way, If I end up hating a scent, I figure I'm only out a couple of bucks.    So, having a chance to grab these 12 vials of popular fragrances for $2 apiece was a no-brainer for me.  The seller, JRoBeauty, was prompt with shipping and a pleasure to deal with.   I am still working my way through them, but so far I am enjoying them and do not regret my purchase.  My favorite so far is Issey Miyake's Eau d'Issey, but the beauty of a sampler pack is there will be something for everyone.
B003ZBL820|5|I only used this product once and My hair felt really nice and smooth afterwards.    Someone was asking for instructions.  You can find it here.  Click the \\"How to Use\\" tab on top.  wenhaircare.com
B00R2L69EG|3|After receiving this product as a sample for free from Crest, I was excited to see if it really was worth buying in the future.  The taste wasn't to bad and the whitening effects were pretty good.  The taste it left in my mouth the next morning was not.  Not sure if I will be purchasing this in the future.
B00AUNJJIQ|1|I have used this product for several weeks.  Compared to other eye creams, it is not especially emollient, and I have noticed no visible effects from using it.  Once I have completed the jar, I will return to using other products.
B00CRKHGUS|5|I have used a curling iron for years to tame my locks and keep them under control. Because my hair is naturally frizzy. When air or blow dried, it puffs up to dizzying proportions, making it appear big and voluminous. I've used a few hair straighteners in my time but this hair straightener from ISA does an excellent job straightening and shaping my hair. In no time at all, I had straight, almost professional salon style hair – something I have never been able to create on my own. It straightened my hair and made it very shiny and glossy.<br />The iron itself is very easy to use. It provides a stylish and elegant look in a relatively short period of time. The most compelling feature of this hair straightening include e.g 100% Solid Tourmaline ceramic plates; Fast and safe straightening, curls, waves; 360 degree no tangle cord; Digital Temperature control up to 220 degree Celsius; Full 2 year warranty. This unit heated up very quickly for me, in just a matter of seconds it was ready for use and the cable is really long about 10-12 feet in length and easy for me to use it.<br />I highly recommend this hair straightener from ISA because it works really well and is designed with features that make it easy to use for all ages. It is even shipped in packaging that is both frustration-free and attractive
B000YDMM2M|4|Better that I expected always used a comb dryer,I am a changed person no more combs for me
B00XZ0PIHW|3|It's ok it is not a bad cream but its not something I would use all the time. It's ok. It doesn't feel bad going on and its not greasy or runny but I have used better then again I' have used way worse! I was sent this product free to review
B0009VNI18|5|I had never heard of this product until I was searching on Amazon and found it.  I wanted an inexpensive but effective hairspray.  After reading the reviews I decided to try it.  I absolutely love this hairspray.  It is inexpensive but effective.  It does not weigh down your hair but has a firm hold and it is very easy to wash out.  I would definitely recommend this hairspray.
B008VSA58K|2|Defiantly not worth your money. When the package came half of them were out of the container!
B00170E31Y|5|I love this line of products. My skin feels so soft and the aroma lingers throughout my bathroom for hours.
B00BI9WW9Y|5|Replaces a similar model that lasted over 5 years. I think it really does help keep toothbrushes sanitary. Use it whenever I travel.
B002M095AC|5|Wonderful product and very professional seller. Received my item on time and as described.  I have a hypersensitive skin and it is always dry so this is the only product that works for me. Thanks to this product I can wear make up, other products dry my skin out and irritate my skin. So, love it. Thank You!!!
B00TQEZB2S|5|Great Product...Fast Shipping
B0017QT5UM|5|GENERAL: This conditioner looks super gross in the bottle. I'm just going to be straight with you, it's brown goop and you'll look at it and wonder if you should really put it on your hair. Just do it. You'll be happy you did. Some people don't really like the citrus smell either, but I find it refreshing. The smell doesn't last too long after rinsing out the conditioner anyway if you really don't like it. My hair retains more of the scent of the castile liquid soap that I use. Some people also don't like that you have to dilute the product, but it doesn't bother me at all: I fill up my old conditioner bottle (holds about 1.5-2C) with water, pour in a cap full of the conditioner, shake it up and pour it on my hair - pretty simple. I wouldn't recommend pre-diluting this product unless you have an opaque, closed container. I don't know if this product is not diluted to save money and plastic waste (yay) or because it changes the composition of the product, so you may want to look into that, but my bet is on the former. I also don't know if this product will under go light oxidation, but it being in a opaque container makes me think it will because of the citrus ingredients being so acidic. If your product DOES undergo light oxidation, it may bleach your hair, which some people have reported when using this conditioner and being out in the sun (think like hydrogen peroxide). This may be desirable or undesirable based on the consumer. I haven't experienced any bleaching at all, but I keep my conditioner in the light-sealed container and live in Michigan where the fall season is mostly overcast or rainy.    CASTILE SOAP AS SHAMPOO: I recently started using the Dr. Bronner's Rose Castile Liquid Soap (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083LU5LC) for my hair. DO NOT USE THE CASTILE SOAP BY ITSELF ON YOUR HAIR. I mean it. Don't do it. You HAVE to use a conditioner. I really like the Dr. Bronner's Citrus Hair Conditioning Rinse in pairing with the castile liquid soap. If youdon't use conditioner, the castile soap will dry out your hair. If you use too much of the castile soap as shampoo, it will dry out your hair. It took my a while to figure out the right amount for my hair. My hair is light to medium ash in color, wavy in texture, medium in thickness, and sits just above my shoulders in length. I use about a nickel size amount, rub it in between my hands, and then massage this into my scalp. Then I rinse out the soap and repeat the same process with only about a dime size amount. Another reviewer suggested this and it seems to work well for me even though I have never done the \\"repeat\\" part of hair washing. There won't be much of a lather. The first time I used this shampoo I used WAY too much and it made a rich lather in my hair and my hair felt like straw after getting out (even after using my argan oil conditioner); I had to use oil on my hair afterwards to smooth it out and it make it greasy after just one day. So you will have to play around with the amount to see what works for you.    CITRIS HAIR RINSE AS CONDITIONER: After that, I started using the citrus rinse and still had some problems. For fear of drying my hair out again, I was using too little of the shampoo and letting the rinse sit on my hair, which made my hair really greasy. Now I dilute my rinse a little more than directed, about one cap full for about 1.5-2 cups of water (I use my old conditioner bottle and it works well for shaking it up). Once I put the rinse on I massage it into my scalp for less than 30 seconds then I immediately lower the temperature of the water so it's cool and rinse the product out. This makes my hair so soft and shiny (and NOT FRIZZY, hallelujah!). It is a little straighter (but still very wavy) when I use these products together than when I was using my argan oil shampoo and conditioner (which made my hair more on the curly side). I usually just let my hair dry overnight while I'm sleeping because I like the natural wavy look of my hair,but  I'm sure the curlier nature of my hair would come back if I dried it with a diffuser or scrunched it and let it air dry. I usually only ever finger comb my hair and I never have problems with tangling when using this conditioner.    So if you want an eco-friendly product that makes your hair very soft, shiny manageable to use with your castile soap (or other natural shampoo) this is the product for you! Stay green!
B00OS9YWJY|4|Nice smooth feel.
B001IDZHY2|1|Got this guy at Big Lots for fifteen Washingtons.  It won't hold a charge, feels very cheaply made and if I had the package or receipt I would return it.  I think I was probably busy and lost them both.  Ironically I have an other good Wahl beard trimmer that all I needed to do was order another user replaceable rechargeable battery for, which I just did.  I'm actually surprised at how horrible this thing is.  Especially how it feels like a toy you would get in a happy meal even more so when compared to the good Wahl trimmer I had that I thought died (but found out I can just order a replacement battery).  The GOOD model I have is the Wahl 9876.
B002LMBLTY|5|Tingly. Rejuvenating.<br />Doesn't dry my hair/scalp out.<br /><br />Though, I don't use it every day.<br />I don't think it should be used daily.
B009NNFB0O|4|although it arrived and I didnt realize it was melted. it smells great and is soft!
B004UDK6AW|4|Let's just say that I've seen more than my share of beauty products go through our home. My wife and two daughters see to that.  It seems like every week there is a different shampoo in our shower, sitting closely to the newest conditioner, next to a new beauty soap, by the latest feminine razor, and close to this week's preferred shaving cream.  I can't even begin to comment on all the makeup and beauty products.<br /><br />But one thing I've noticed in the past several weeks is the constant use of this Dermoganic Fast Dry Shaping Spray Plus Hold.  Maybe I've noticed because of the long name, possibly because of the bright green can, most definitely because my wife sent me to the local drug store where I had to pay $19.95 for this product.  Obviously they all love it.<br /><br />I personally didn't understand the magic until my wife used it on my \\"ugly stage\\" first ever pony-tail. Lots of wispy blond hair, but not all of it is long enough to gather properly yet. A few quick puffs of Dermorganic and suddenly I look like Norman Bates mother in Psycho. Just in time for Halloween.<br /><br />Save yourself $5.00 and buy it here.
B000Q4QFX6|5|This item was purchased for a birthday in December so it has not been used yet, but I have seen this exact product in use and that is why I purchased it for my daughter.  It is so fun!!!
B004YD76II|3|explanation of the tip use was poor
B005V3W036|4|I mix this oil with water in a spray bottle and use as an air freshener for my kitchen and bathrooms--it smells so yummy just like vanilla extract!
B002UUT38I|3|It was hard to push out the lotion. It might be old? I thought it will be softer after using it and the temperature of this cleanser gets warm but it didn't. Although I had the issue getting out, I was able to finish all. Do I buy it again? There are so many to choose from that the cleanser doesn't has to be from Olay for me.
B00543733U|3|The product is great but I feel the amount that is actually in this is not worth the price. As with most pump types, there comes a point (way to soon with this) where you just can't get much product out. Other foundations I have used that are the same size/ounces have lasted much longer. Again, love the product but would not buy again unless price drops or more product is included.
B00MB8R4CQ|3|Its ok.
B00ITZGU84|5|I used to use Adidas Cotton-Tech Deodorant for women, and loved it. Unfortunately it was discontinued. I even emailed the company and practically BEGGED them to bring it back, and they said no. I hate antiperspirant because not only does it stain clothing, I still sweat anyway. I have tried Tom's, but it didn't work at all and left me smelling worse than if I had no odor protection on at all! I have resorted to using men's deodorant but I hate smelling &#34;manly&#34;.<br /><br />I have been looking and looking for YEARS to find another women's deodorant that was aluminum-free, when I happened upon this deodorant on another website. Not sure if I'm allowed to post the website here, but it starts with d and ends in rugstore with a dot com on the end ;) It was very reasonably priced. I ordered the maximum it would allow me to order, and I love it! It hasn't irritated my sensitive skin, and it keeps me smelling fresh all day long without smelling manly!
B0079I1HEY|5|Oh love this conditioner.
B001540XWK|5|Shipped on time, everything perfect as I expected it. I recommend ordering from MyBeautyWarehouse.
B003VI0HVA|3|I like the product,a little dab is all u need. The smell is ok. this product really works for me.
B00ANJJUEU|5|very nice fragrance but it doesnt last long!  very soft & pretty! it would be alot nicer if the smell lasted longer but it doesnt
B002QI2TPI|5|Nice product.
B0081NLR8M|4|I didn't feel that it worked as well as the regular red jar regenerist cream I usually use.  I have always used Olay products and I feel like I look younger than I am.
B003U3C5SY|5|Great Product!
B0002KHTG6|5|THE BEST BRUSH HEAD - ORAL B PROFESSIONAL PROWHITE REPLACEMENT BRUSH. RECOMMENDED TO EVERYONE WHO NEEDS A GREAT ORAL B CLEANING
B00K2O3NV2|5|Has help my skin tremendously.
B002N5MHLU|4|clean shave, easy to clean, easy to charge.  A little to expensive but if last long time it would be worth it
B004Y9M2U4|5|Perfect shade! I love it :) the brush it comes with one the top is really soft and smooth, just be careful when you have to twist the part below the brush to make the cover up come out. It only takes 2 to 3 twists to get it to come out but any more than that and you'll have it squirting all over your hands. Would definitely buy again&#60;3
B004UQ6Q62|3|a little noisy
B0013TVEWA|2|I tried the Sonicare and was really surprised by how powerful it is....even in the the \\"sensitive\\" setting. This just seems like too much. Saving time brushing will usually mean you are brushing too hard, and likely cause gum recession and tooth abrasion. You need to brush softly, but for between 2-3 minutes, 2-3 times/day (as well as flossing, which nothing can replace). \\"No pain, no gain,\\" does NOT apply to toothbrushing. I certainly would not recommend this for your teeth. I think if they can tone it down 75%, it might actually be good. The gum \\"massager,\\" mode makes no sense. Proper tooth and gingival care has more to do with the prevention of accumulation of plaque, etc., and \\"massaging,\\" the gum is just a great marketing idea. I think the only people who really need to use an electric toothbrush are those with dexterity issues, etc., and they may benefit from the use of an electric toothbrush, but the trade off, e.g. recession, etc., may not be worth it. Also, you can't really try to put less pressure on it, because then it will not clean that well. I can also tell you that you will spurt toothpaste all over unless you wait to turn it on when it is in your mouth...the vibration is just that harsh. If you accidently hit your tooth with it, and you will, you will feel like there is a jackhammer in your mouth! I know there are a lot of people out there who are huge fans of these....I am not one of them. If you are still considering this item.....You only get one head, so if you want to share this (if you are a fan) you will have to spend more on another head. It does come with different colored rings so you can identify different brushes, but those rings slip around, perhaps because of the harsh vibration (I pressed pretty hard to put the two pieces together). The actual quality is very good, and it feels sturdy and not cheaply made. I just cannot recommend something that makes my teeth hurt after using it, no matter how it feels, or how cool it looks (and it does look pretty cool and hi-tech). For about two-three percent of the cost of the Sonicare (and no operating cost) you can have a superior instrument to keep your teeth and gums healthy.s look pretty cool and hi-tech). For about two-three percent of the cost of the Sonicare (and no operating cost) you can have a superior instrument to keep your teeth and gums healthy.
B002AN5RWQ|5|Bowl is as expected.  Not sure why I paid so much for a small stainles steal bowl, but it fits perfectly in my hand when making up lather.<br /><br />Looks nice when not in use, though you could just use a coffee mug...
B000RLG8JE|5|Hose split on the original in a way that could not be repaired. This item was identical to the original and easy to replace. Saved having to buy a complete new Water Pic.
B008FP6KBU|5|These are supposed to be nail brushes, but I bought them as<br />regular paint brushes to use for watercolors or other paints a<br />young child might use. Good deal!
B0081NLRE6|2|I ran to get this when I read in the latest \\"Allure\\" magazine, it had made the list for one of their 'picks' for best products.<br /><br />I have some really coarse hairs on the chin that are too light for laser and I was really hoping this product would do what it said it would.<br /><br />I used it first following directions to the \\"T\\", leaving it on for 10 minutes (the max per instructions), I applied thickly, and you are supposed to rub the balm in for 20 seconds first before applying the remover cream.<br /><br />It took off ONLY my fine hairs with that time and process.<br /><br />The next day I re applied more thickly and left it on for 20 minutes (even though recommendations is 10 minutes max). Finally it DID take off most of the coarse hairs, but again, a few were left.<br /><br />The good side is it was not as irritating as the other cream hair removal products (which are way to harsh for my sensitive skin).<br /><br />No miracle product and absolutely didn't live up to the hype in \\"Allure\\" magazine. And very overpriced for the smallish quantity they give you.
B001ESKLZQ|5|I have been using these pencils for about two years now and I love them. I use them to fill in my eyebrows as well as shape them. They are simple to use and come with a sharpener which I use typically every few weeks. The product is simple, but it works. I have tried other, more expensive pencils but they do not lay as nice as these. Many others I have used are either chalky or are too dark even though the shade looks similar to these. The color works well with my hair color, which is light brown. I have also used them on my eyelids when I am going for a more natural look and do not have time to apply my liquid eyeliner. I would definitely recommend using this product.
B006HU6CKY|5|Everything I thought it would be. My hair hasn't looked this shiny in a long time!  Would definitely purchase again!
B001R5UJQM|5|I love this product, it is very gentle and my Rosacea has really improved since I started using it. My doctor recommended it and I bought it from her the first time, it cost me a whole lot more!
B00QMRPG5O|5|Like
B0019ZEVZU|4|Comfortable to hold, easy to keep clean, and works very well. Two significant advantages for travelers are that the entire unit is relatively small and that the charger takes 220. The one-minute alert is silly and the necessity to push the on-off button twice is annoying. Hence the four stars.
B000G666I8|1|I am not sure why I am having such a terrible experience with this product as opposed to other reviews. Firstly if you don't take the time to make sure you get your creases right on, which can take a few minutes, you get a double crease. By the time you do this  you could have ironed and got better results. Secondly it simply does not work with certain materials such as a heavier material pair of chinos ( see photo below after 1-45 minute  and 1-30 minute cycle)  In my opinion proper pressing needs a steam component to work. This not only does not have that but also does not get hot enough. Do not buy!!
B000ALFROS|5|I received this as a sample but will definitely be purchasing more.  This glossing cream does not leave a greasy feeling on your hair.  You need to use a pea size amount (not dime-sized as the other reviewer mentioned).  You work it through your damp hair and then blow dry and it makes your hair wonderfully soft without being greasy like other glossing products.  This is a cream product and not an oil product so I think that is why it works better at glossing your hair and not making it look or feel greasy.  This is probably the best hair product that I have ever used.  I am 40-years old but like to keep current with hairstyles and this product worked wonders on my dry hair.
B000143C0K|4|These are my second set of andis trimmers that I have purchased. Great hair trimmers and good quality for the price.
B0006IV9XI|5|This perfume has a rich, sweet and pleasant fragrance. It is not flowery and doesn't smell like chemicals either. It is top quality at a low price and I highly recommend this brand to any woman who likes sophisticated scents or musk perfume.
B000P22X62|5|As described
B004DMEXQS|1|it doesnt work. dont waste your money... dont save some bucks its better to pay more and have quality razor. The package says its a sample...not for sale!
B00B1DSBSI|5|Very good shampoo
B001QT8CVI|4|Really nice shampoo...works well on my hair and not overly scented.
B002XQ1R7E|5|FANTASTIC SMELL FOR SUCH A GOOD PRICE!!!!!  Unfortunatley I broke my bottle the 2nd day of having it, but instead of wasting the fragrance I quickly dropped my couch coushins into the Cuba Orange, I can say that it was quite pleasant smelling for over a month!
B000WI1VU8|5|I found one of these Tweezerman packs at a Marshall's discount store about ten years ago, and given their cheap price I assumed they were a down line for the regular kind.  But no!  They were awesome!  Since then I have purchased many of these sets from Amazon to give as gifts.  Santa brought these for the kids' stockings this year, and now even my son who goes to military school is a convert.  The little pouch is lovely, well-made, and comes in many colors and patterns.  The tweezers are the same as we used to get back in the day, with perfectly-ground tips and a nice, smooth pinch.  The price is so good through Amazon that you can buy an extra pack to keep in your glove compartment for emergency sliver retrieval, or those times you're early for carpool and have nothing better to do than inspect your shaggy eyebrows.
B001E5E2EA|5|Takes care of the frizzies without adding weight...you can't really even tell it is there...not greasy like the old kinds of dressings were.  Great customer service, as always.
B00AG4QCAM|3|I like it and I use it on the especially painful cysts. It is uncomfortable on those ones (no more than an extraction would be) but I found the more pain the heat causes (within reason) the more it pain it relieves. People with cystic acne know how deeply painful bad cysts can be. It also seems to make them come to a head a day or so faster than they would normally but it is not as effective on my cystic acne as some people rave it to be. It is not very environmentally friendly as it EATS batteries. This alone is almost reason enough for me to stop using it.
B00JLAOP3S|5|Really great foundation brush! It's even better than high end sigma foundation brush! Seller sincerely sent e-mail to buyers to ask for feedbacks, really nice business of Keshima. Hoping the seller still keep up the quality and the price! :)
B000F35R00|5|I can really feel the quality every time I use them. They clip the nail without any real effort required.
B00DZITWJE|5|Kept color bright for 5 weeks now
B0045WDQFA|5|This is a very inexpensive to great looking hair. It requires no time and it fixes all summer and treated hair issues.
B000ZLWNOA|2|The cross action tooth brush I ordered June 23 was a replacement for one I had for 2 months and stopped working.  I received the second one with a notice that the charger was being sent seperately and I have not yet received it. I have notified the company and have heard nothing from them.  Being from the Cincinnati area originally, I use a lot of Proctor and Gamble products and for the most part been happy with them.  The failure of this original toothbrush was a disappointment and not receiving a charger for the second was an additional disappointment.  I did appreciate the prompt attention I received getting a replacement now if I only had a charger-----.      I thought it worked well originally but I agree it is bulky and noisy.  It is my first electric toothbrush so I have no other one to compare it to.  I bought the original one from Amazon, a letter came from P & G and the second one was sent from another company.

B000NLJFNY|4|I've been using this product on and off for the last few months.  If you want to compare your hair to mine: I have thick, golden-brown, wavy hair that dries out if I don't take care of it (i.e. heat styling), but mostly is soft.<br /><br />Now, here's my take on it:<br /><br />1 -  Yes, it did dry my hair out a bit, but not horribly so.  If you're a heavy user of heat styling, this probably isn't for you.  I blow dry or iron my hair ONLY once every one or two weeks.  To combat the drying, simply alternate with a heavily-conditioning shampoo and conditioner.  I really like Renpure's \\"My Pretty Hair is Parched.\\"<br /><br />2 -  Yes, it makes my hair grow faster.  I've kind of experimented over the last few months, and came to the conclusion that you have to use it at LEAST every other wash to get real results.<br /><br />3 -  Some reviewers have complained about their hair falling out.  Let's think about this.  Nobody keeps the same hair forever, your hair naturally falls out over time as NEW hair grows in.  See where this is going?  Your hair's growth rate fluctuates depending on a number of factors: health, stress, smoking, etc.<br /><br />When I was kid (long before I even cared about growing my hair out), I noticed that my hair fell out right before a growth spurt.  So whenever I saw a bunch of hair in the drain, I knew my hair was about to grow crazy fast.<br /><br />4 -  Hair growth happens at your scalp, NOT THE ENDS.  So save some money and massage the shampoo into your scalp only - and let it sit for about 5 minutes to let the science cocktail sink in.  For me, the conditioner worked great for ALL of my hair, so long as I used a leave-in conditioner.  I really like Garnier Sleek and Shine Smoothing Milk.<br /><br />5 -  Some tips on growing your hair out (beyond this product):<br /><br />a -  Exercise, exercise, exercise.  How does your hair grow?  By proteins and other ingredients.  How does your scalp get these ingredients to the build site?  BLOOD.  Exercise increases your heart rate... and consequently the health and growth of your locks.<br /><br />b -  When in the shower, massage your hair in a circular pattern with your finger tips.  This stimulates (again) blood circulation, and therefore your hair growth.<br /><br />c -  Vitamins.  Not just biotin and iron (which you need), but a multivitamin.  The healthier your body is, the more efficiently it will operate - and grow that hair!<br /><br />d -  Don't smoke.  This will improve your skin and teeth too.<br /><br />Wordy review, I know, but I have been obsessed with growing my hair out.  I've tried it ALL.  Bottom line is that this product works, but its not magic.  It alone will not makes your hair grow over night.  Just think of it as a helpful boost.  And happy growing!<br /><br />UPDATE 12-23-14<br /><br />I feel I should let future buyers know that this product, while wonderful, can fade hair color.  I gave a bottle to my friend, who dyes her hair black, and she said that she wished she could've kept using it, but it faded her hair color.  I imagine that cocktail in the bottle that promotes hair growth may not be friendly to color pigments.<br /><br />Good luck again!  I hope some of you have gotten longer, beautiful hair since I made the review.
B007ZRZSR6|5|Product came in perfect condition and was a definite asset for my oral care while traveling.  It is a little noisey and the water compartment is on the small side.  I had to refill it once before completing my cleansing routine.  It worked very well and I would recommend this item particularly when traveling.
B00B9FU21M|5|Works well to remove all traces of eye makeup and doesn't irritate my eyes. I will continue to purchase this.
B000VKV29M|1|I really liked the look and feel of this trimmer, and it seems well made.  A major factor in my decision to buy was the power by dry cells.  It's nice to have no wall warts or stands or wires.  Unfortunately it pulls some hairs instead of clipping them.  I didn't want to experiment enough to figure out why, but it will do it when trimming the beard or with the cutters on your face where you do the edge.  It doesn't pull all the time, about 1 out of 5 strokes, but when it does it isn't a clean pull and it hurts more than if you just pulled the hair straight out.  A lot more.  Enough to throw this product out.  I'm guessing they put cheap crappy blades on it.  Too bad.
B00A0GH4X0|5|This is not the basic stylist cape! I ordered this cape for a friend just starting in the salon business. This cape will impress her clients and I would feel special if a stylist draped me in it. Pretty and sophisticated looking!!!
B000PA8PF2|5|Love this product. Have used a volumizing mousse before that I thought did wonders (and it was an expensive salon product), but Phyto takes the cake. Make sure not to apply to the scalp as that will cause build-up. Apply to the roots and you will see instant results. You don't have to use much, so it's worth the money.
B007SOIAUS|5|I never write reviews.<br />But I absolutely LOVE this lash enhancer. I only used it a couple of weeks, but I can see the difference in my lashes.<br />I never want to run out.
B00GYF65TK|1|The eye gel did absolutely nothing for me.  I read the reviews here and thought it made be good.  In fact, it made the area under my eyes look worse.  Hated it!!!
B004BJ6VNG|4|Love the colour and texture, ibut darker than it looks on the picture
B003CY0QL4|4|I cut my hair every two weeks, and love how i can go without the cord, and also without saving multiple clips. The single sliding clip for length adjustment works perfectly and no more having a whole bag to save clips.<br /><br />Big pro- if the battery runs low, this clipper runs full strength on the cord... as opposed to other clippers where you have to wait for the battery to charge. This means you don't have to worry about the battery dying in the middle of a haircut (nightmare if you have to wait for the battery to charge)<br /><br />I although wish it had an adjustment for zero clip... when trimming bare without the clip it pinches and cuts a little... as opposed to my other clippers where you can adjust a little slack so it doestn' cut skin.
B000Z4EI0O|4|I was really happy when I received it. The package is awsome and I use it as a decoration in my bathroom.<br /><br />The products are really good. The smell of Cookies is really warm and makes you want to buy and eat cookies (thanks for the diet). But the Milk one is really weird. It's like hot milk, but cold. It's not really what I expected. But as the smell doesn't last, it's ok.
B00IIECUU8|5|They are absolutely amazing! I would highly recommend this product. They came two days before their arrival date, and when you open them, it has a somewhat of a plastic odor, but it goes away. They are easy to clean and they feel great on my face and helps me get a flawless finish. 5 STARS⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
B001C80Q3A|1|i tired it and i did what the directions said to do and it didnt work at but thanks anyway
B0009OAGXI|5|Smells really good!
B00GMMQZ6I|5|Definitely what I was looking for to add to my soaps.
B005N7YHGS|4|Product as described. 5 star seller!  FAST shipping.  Thank you.
B004C0SUE2|3|This product actually dried out my hair a little too much. I felt like I still needed a conditioning after using it despite it being a 2-in-1 shampoo. The scent was delightful though. It reminded me of something else from my childhood. I would probably buy it again based on the scent alone.
B0002DNZ9I|5|It is by far, authentic and the perfect matte shadow which matches almost any color.  It is a perfect hue for all seasons!  It looks fantastic on my dark skin and I do pair it with an eyeshadow primer.  Thanks again!
B00A3WR5C6|3|It works ok, but it's small and the bottles are small. It's ok for a first timer. The price is equivalent.
B000V0X61O|5|Best fragrance out there.  Smells like spring.
B0049LUI9O|4|Can't seems to cut the one with curbed one...<br />and need to have it clean all the time after...<br /><br />but still good product to have.
B009TJ8B90|5|works and smells great it was a great gift from my wife i put it on right before I go to bed
B0062MPL4U|4|This goes on like velvet and really helps in the makeup application process.  I would buy this product again, but definitly recommend trying this small sample size if you are new to the product.  It takes a little getting used to the texture
B000050B6D|5|In less than a minute I was back up and running. The shave was back to being closer than before. I don't know about the claim that it is x% closer shave. I also don't buy the \\"must change every 6 months\\" as I hadn't changed my blade in 2 years! The blades are very well made and the old head was shaving fine.
B005TKZS76|5|Great price and great value!<br />The brushes are very soft and comfortable, and they aren't like any of those cheap mineral powder brushes with hairs falling over everywhere...<br />This is great! And I love how colorful they are as well :)
B0018BYLRS|5|great buy
B00D3XW8W4|5|I love these hair ponytail holders.  Great colors and they don't hurt your hair.  They do stretch out a bit and don't retract.
B00MAOCXX6|4|I like it! Not sure about the swivel. I can't really tell if the ball has made much of a difference. I'm not sure if I like it so much just because it has 5 blades..  I like the look. Works great. No complaints. Is it better than any other 5 blade women's razor? I couldn't tell ya, check it out for yourself.
B00IW58KEI|1|Don't buy!!!<br />it do not work ;(
B0069HXKNM|1|I took my FASH makeup out of state. I had a carry on bag but the flight was full and they gate attendants asked the majority of us to check our carry ons for free. I said fine. Got back home to see that my eyeshadow palettes were destroyed. I was so made!! Shadow was everywhere. I packed my things neatly and tightly.  But you know when you hand your bags over the people toss em, they fall the the floor and all. Ugh...anyway. I thought to buy this since Amazon was out of FASH at the time. This palette sucks! Even when you wet the brush and tap the specific color you want the eyeshadow is NOT intensified (when using primer). It sucks. I would not recommend this for women of color.
B000P20QKW|4|Brought it for my girlfriend. I live the smell, not overpowering just right nice light and sweet. Good buy for any woman
B000FQ9J5G|5|it somehow brings the curl back to my hair and stays curly all day
B001J6O3HA|5|All ok, thanks!
B00B3U843G|2|Funny contraption. Seems more like a child's toy.
B001B1F93U|5|I was not very confident of incense packed like that...but it was really cheap and I wanted to try it.I did and the results were pretty,I mean pretty good. My whole huge house was filled with a delicate fragance,not too smoky they light easily and when they burn there is no mess.All in all a good purchase and I am quite a fan of incenses,so I know!
B000C1W2DK|5|GREAT!
B002RSU0XU|5|This is as pure as it gets . Only need a couple drops on forearm .
B006ZBP8NM|1|I used this product on a few sunspots and the peel made the spots darker.  I thought I might at least get some peeling, however I did not.  I realize there are those who love this product, and I am truly glad it has worked for them, but my experience was disappointing.  Thankfully Amazon has a wonderful return policy.  I will look around and see if something else works.
B002Q67HRK|5|Stays on a long time. Better than any other eye liner I have tried. This is the first gel liner I tried, but I like it a lot.
B001EJIMRO|4|ok
B0047PSV14|5|This is an easy to use, roomy but portable light.  Cures nails fast & is a great value for the price.  Nails look professionally done every time.  I highly recommend it.
B00NKQQJII|5|I really like this mascara. It was alittle to wet at first but after a week or so it dried alittle and now it's perfect.
B00375L8RE|5|50 SPF, soft and creamy texture, and a delightful scent!
B009AFH0S6|2|Poor craftmanship and quality
B002UU1N54|1|I really liked the description of this, but it's very strong-smelling and it isn't even a pleasant scent. It was also quite drying - I had to put lotion on my hands afterward. Two hours later, even after the scented lotion, I can still smell the unpleasant scent of the Cleanwell Foaming Hand Sanitizer. I threw it away.
B005LFNUF6|5|I agree 100% with previous review. Exactly what I was about to say. I found this at TJMAXX and bought it to use on chest - to save more expensive small bottle retinol's for neck/face.  Now I put it under eyes and on neck in the AM...Saving Retinol for use only at night. I will check at store to repurchase - I hate shipping chrgs. (Amazon doesnt stock much so we have to pay to ship?? No thanks)
B00182JYSS|3|I hate this toothbrush lol I learned I dont like the plastic bits they dont do anythig for teeth have to brush them twice to truly feel like my teeth are clean and forget aboutthe tongue scraper talk about painful jeez I prefer a regular bristle brush
B00703EITY|5|I started using this product on June 23, 2014.  It has been a little over a month and I have seen a huge change in my blemishes.  I am a deep brown and suffer from hyper pigmentation.  I use this product only once a day in the evenings before bed after washing my face with a mild cleanser and rubbing an astringent for a deeper clean.  Once my face is dry, I apply this serum and let it settle before going to bed.<br />I am so happy that someone told me about this product.  My blemishes have lightened up so much and I still have a half a bottle left over.  Now, I only do spot treatments because I don't want the product lighting my entire face. Oh, and as far as I can tell, this product does not break me out. If you decide to use this during the day (which I don't recommend) be sure to use a good SPF over it.  Use SPF in general if you have blemishes so they don't get darker.
B004Y9GV60|5|must have!!!!!
B00ACTL94A|4|Love the color of this nail polish. Very pretty Halo Hue. The polish is a silver color. The polish itself is not as good as some polishes that I have used but its nice. The polish was not as smooth as I am used to with the higher quality polish. Im in love with the hue and will order other colors. Just not as impressed with the polish itself.
B00LZGIYDS|5|Easy to use and very handy...love it!!!
B006GZPKGW|5|I got this light as a birthday present to use with my Gelish polish and i love it! It's so much faster than the little light i was using. It cures really well and it doesn't get hot. Its more than big enough to put all 5 fingers in at once, even if you have big hands. I used it to do my husbands toe nails and he got all 5 toes in with no problem and he's a size 11 foot! lol The pre-set time settings are really helpful, especially if you're using Gelish. I don't have to use the timer on my phone anymore. It turns on when you put your hand in too so you don't have to turn it on and off, although you can do that with it too on the other setting. I highly recommend this light! The same light at the beauty supply store was about $50 more! Great light!
B00KKEMIJ2|5|Love it!
B00RW5XH10|1|Would give zero stars. They suck. Rip when you peel them off, the color rubs off within 2 hours of applying the sticker, they lasted 5 hours total b4 coming off all together
B000GLRREU|5|I recomend this item. It works perfectly!!<br />It cleans your teeth deeply and is very easy to handle.<br />A lot of options for different types of purpurar surprised me!
B006UET5D8|5|Verry nice.<br />Stays on as long as you need it.
B0043OYFKU|5|I was so tempted to get the Clarisonic but did not want to shell out $200 for it and am so glad I didn't. Does what it says, and I leave it in the shower for greater convenience. Have been using it for close to a month now, and the batteries have yet to run out. I have sensitive yet oily skin, and it works great on me. Would certainly recommend this product to everyone!
B002BWOXZ8|5|This moisturizing cream is a wonderful product.  Takes care of my dry skin better than anything I have used before.
B00CWLXGL0|1|It does not look like the original product. Not in the original packaging.  I should have ordered it from pure Fuji. It was the same price just did not come as fast. No stars
B00TWPU9F0|5|Good product and seller.
B008U12YV4|5|This product fits in my medium sized purse, and I am surprised how much space I have acquired just by having it more organized with this product. Yes, Switching it from purse to purse will be easier for me, plus it is flexible if I need to put it in something smaller. I feels like it was made with good quality material and will be an item I can use for the long run. I find items very easy as well. Thank you!
B00BAYWOFY|4|I would buy again if I lost these
B000RBMGMW|1|The product never dries, it stays sticky for hours.  I have tried the ultra violet machine and blowing drying but it is still very sticky after several hours.
B000NZAIC2|5|I love it<br /><br />Dudu-Osun African Black Soap<br /><br />Dudu-Osun African Black Soap<br /><br />Dudu-Osun African Black Soap<br /><br />Dudu-Osun African Black Soap<br /><br />Dudu-Osun African Black Soap
B000R94QYA|1|I bought Nuface back in June and as soon as the product arrived, I noticed a small crack in the plastic inside where the metal heads are.  I didnt' make much of it, and continued to use the machine. Within a few days, the crack started to get bigger and the plastic was completely broken, to the point the head attachment would not hold on to the body of the machine any longer. I contacted the company, they were very nice and they replaced my machine with another one within 1 week. The new machine arrived, and at this time i completely inspected and made sure that everything was 100% Ok with the product. I started using it again, and guess what?? the plastic is breaking AGAIN!! at the same place !! I think the machine does work, but Im extremely frustrated that this keeps happening! At this point I'm not even sure if I still want to deal with this anymore...<br />I think the metal heads are extremely heavy and the plastic that makes the body of the machine cannot sustain the weight... bad engineering!
B000GCUC6O|1|I would hope my product does good..I haven't got it yet...but I'll keep in touch whether its right or not
B009Q9XUYY|5|I purchased this hair dryer for my daughter becasue she was spending a lot of time drying her long hair.  It cut the time down.  The other hair dryers have a frequency or pitch noise that I can't handle.  This one is not as noisy and the frequency or pitch is lower.
B00A3LVMMQ|5|Got this to store my Merkur 180 razor and Tweezerman brush .  The fit for both is perfect and I am pleasantly surprised at the size, sturdiness and beautiful chrome finninsh.  It feels well  balanced and sturdy so there is no worry of it tipping over.  The finninsh is a stylish chrome that matches the finninsh of the razor very well.  Have had it so far for two months with no rusting.  I do however pat the stand dry from time to time.  With good care I see no reason that it would not last for a long time.
B004XNIR1E|5|It's glitter....pretty hard to get it wrong...
B004LXOLFM|5|favorite blush! good pigment- just a tiny bit is all you need. very long lasting and gives the perfect healthy blush
B004HGLA3Y|5|Nice color and even nicer to be able to find it at a reasonable price with running around town at these gas prices!
B00JPO4EPO|5|Love it. Very nice  presented and high quality. Worth  every penny. Highly  recommended! 9
B0036ZA40W|5|I think this is the best toothbrush ever!
B009PZGYJM|5|Nice
B0072ZXFCQ|4|My wife and kids love the smell and I too like it a lot.  The fragrance is very fresh.  But the spray was not coming out evenly, the first spray comes out nice but next presses doesn't seem to have pressure.
B003FLKV5U|5|Great product.  I've used it for years.  Great price here on Amazon!
B0034UBI40|4|I am a 43 year old guy who has dark circles and bags under my eyes. I bought this looking for a miracle. My dark circles havent diminished but my bags are gone. Be patient though....it took a few weeks using it religiously for the bags to go away. I definitely will buy this again. As for the dark circles well thank god for cover up. Lol
B0069UKGGS|5|received promptly, excellent quality
B003JKFEL8|5|I really like this. I bought it after watching YouTube. It gives hair a shine & it's not weighed down. There is a nice fragrance to it also. 05/01/17- I still love this stuff.
B004VN31JO|4|holds a lot of polishes in a variety of sizes and shapes.  looks clean and tidy.  mounts easily to wall.
B001459IEE|5|Thanks
B001ET787E|5|Great Product! Great Price! Excellent Packaging! Fast Shipping! Thanks!
B003CTVSKC|5|This product contains mustard seed which makes the conditioner smell like pickle juice so if you can't put up with that do not buy this product. The smell didn't bother me and I used it with heat for 20 minutes before rinsing. The jar says to use a moisturizing conditioner afterwards and i did. My hair did not get hard and felt sufficiently conditioned. I hope the long term results of this line will be good.
B000CECSAO|5|I put 2 coats  And surprisingly it stayed on for almost 8 full days with only 1 minor chip after a 6 jr water park visit haha. I think this is a great quickie way to add a hint of color. I've not put more than 2 coats on....yet. I would buy again for sure.
B000HGJL4S|5|While it's true that this bottle of frangrance oil isn't LARGE, it has a whole lot of burns worth in it.  (You only use a little bit at a time.) I burn this oil at work and my co-workers LOVE when the smell of it drifts out of my office and into the common areas.  It's a lovely smell for either men or women.  It's really, really nice.
B00G6BCXWK|4|I purchased this hair as a sample to see if I really liked the product. I'm happy with my purchase.<br />First of all the shipping is very quick.  The hair is smooth shiny and bouncy.  I did feel like the hair on the weft could have been fuller but I'll fold it over when making my wig.  This is a good seller to buy from over all.
B003VP1EFG|5|This is a full-sized Clinique Different lipstick--it comes in a Clinique green tube rather than the silver-tone one, but in all other respects it is the same product you can purchase from Clinique or clinique.com.  By the time you pay the shipping cost, this lipstick costs about the same too (it retails from Clinique at $15), but you do save a bit as you don't have to pay Clinique's shipping price.  It's a nice, moderate-coverage lipstick and it's a beautiful color.
B000VEPHYY|5|This brow sculpting gel does the job. No flakes. Goes on smoothly. Holds hairs in place. This price is also Good.
B000BUUVTO|4|I have been using Gillette's Fusion Razor for a few weeks now and it's a nice razor with some pros and cons compared to Gillette's other blades.  Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.<br /><br />- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn't careful.<br /><br />- Shave isn't much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).<br /><br />- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.<br /><br />- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.<br /><br />- Design and look of the Fusion isn't as slick or nice as the M3 Power.<br /><br />- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.<br /><br />- The single blade on the back is useless.  It's very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.<br /><br />In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.<br /><br />This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it's a nice shave, but it's not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.<br /><br />**** RECOMMENDEDworth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.    **** RECOMMENDED
B006PD797I|5|gives a very soft look that I love.
B0009OMU0A|5|Love this trimmer.  No combs to swap, just dial in the right length and start trimming. The blades are sharp and it cuts smoothly, without pulling my wiskars. The battery lasts for multiple shaves before I need to recharge.
B00EEHOOI4|2|I wanted so badly to love this product. I'm in my late 20s with oily, acne prone skin. I struggle with acne daily, so I was hoping this would help. Unfortunately, it didn't. I liked the smell of these products. It reminds me of the beauty aisle at a health foods store. I loved the way the booster serum felt, and the masque tingled nicely. The face wash does not lather up, but that didn't bother me. The moisturizer ran out long before the rest of the products did, which was really annoying.<br /><br />Shortly after starting to use these products, I developed terrible, painful cystic acne on my chin, which I've never had before. I continued to use these products, hoping it was just getting out the impurities, but the issues persevered. I had issues all over my face, with my chin being the worst. When the moisturizer ran out, I started using a new product and the acne on my chin finally subsided. All in all, I just can't use this again. Everyone's skin is different though!
B0088W8E8W|4|Can't find this anywhere and it is my favorite Herbal Essences.
B0056GDG90|5|It does what it supposed to do and I love it better than using a blow dryer and a brush separately.
B002HG7PD0|5|The product is excellent! Buying this product online saved me at least 30 to 40% from what I would have paid at one of our local retailers.
B007SS3G08|1|This glue is terrible!!! Lasts 30 mins if you're lucky
B0072XR560|5|Nice, as described
B000HGHGQS|3|I like the mask. It is very gentle and works well for my oily, acne prone skin.  My problem with this buy is that the picture of the product says it contains 4.8 ounces of the cream.  Yet, the product that I recieved is only 3.9 ounces.  I'm just curious why they did not specify the amount in the description.  Also, if the image of the product is going to be posted, it should reflect it accurately.  I would have liked to know what I was paying for.
B005X2F7KI|5|Perfect!
B0014DGP4W|1|i am using Lanza Healing Color-Preserving Shampoo for about 5 years now.<br />And this time I've placed me regular order and got wrong product! Label on the bottle is the same, but bottle itself is in different shape and product is different color.
B004K1EK42|2|I had one before and it was soft. This one looks like it but is nothing like it. I would not recommend it. The Velcro pulls out hair and it makes it hard o breath.
B005SRTDWQ|1|I bought this product about 8 months ago and used it until it ran out.  My skin never peeled nor did I see any improvement.  I recently researched retinol and now know that it is sensitive to light and air and that it should be kept in an aluminum tube.  this product is not sold in an aluminum tube, which would then render it useless, which is not surprising to me given the fact that this had no effect on my skin.<br /><br />I bought another retinol product from amazon (skinceuticals 1% retinol)  that is kept in an aluminum tube.  it has 1/2 the strength that this product is alleged to have.  w/the skinceuticals my skin had all of the effects that its supposed to have when you use retinol.  it peeled!  it got red!  I had to start using the skinceuticals product every third night, and then eventually every other night, but it did its job very well.  pores got smaller.  btw, I also started to use 'bell essence intensive anti aging treatment' at the suggestion of one of the reviewers and it has helped to keep the redness and peeling to a minimum and my skin is softer and plumper.<br /><br />if the ncn had done its job at the alleged 2% strength, the skinceuticals 1% would not have had any effect.  so, the ncn I think is a scam.  either the company knows that they are selling a useless product, or they don't know enough about retinol to know its useless.  either way, its not good.<br /><br />I just read that a dermatologist said that you need to do three things to change your skin.  a retinol product, exfoliation, and to use a product to nourish the new skin (i.e. bell essence).  that makes sense to me.  I use a cheaper version of clarisonic to exfoliate.
B003OQVX76|5|Great spray! I probably don't use it as I should, but I use it as an every day spray. Gives a nice hold to last me throughout the whole day of work. At night, if I get too lazy to shower, it's all OK! The spray doesn't leave any residues or white flakes on the hair, so you can go right to bed after work and not have to worry about flakes.
B001126Z1E|5|This is a product that is hard to find in stores as they are usually out of stock or only have other colors. I was estatic to find this product on line and from someone who has a quick response and shipping time. Thank you!
B000GG5VCK|3|Smells good, but I do resent manufacturer/bottler making the hole at the top of the bottle way too large to cause more fluid to come out than typically desired by the ordinary consumer. Obviously, it was deliberate company decision to cause product to get used quicker even as it frustrated the user, in the US commercial corporate tradition of sacrificing consumer interests in the pursuit of ever increasing profit. With some effort I was able to cut off the tip of a retractable ball point pen and glue it upside down into the large hole to solve the problem. Thankfully there's Amazon's opportunity for consumers to sound off at anti-people policies with customer reviews.
B00BBR6T0Q|5|This is one of the better Hugo Boss colognes. This is great for everyday type of cologne. A really good scent. Its pretty strong, so only 2 squirts is enough.
B009ASKA9O|2|cheap looking lip gloss maybe good for a 10 yr. Old girl
B001KYS3HC|5|I love love this.  I have almost shoulder length highly textured hair that is often dry when not fully relaxed that can be a real work out (think Macey Gray :) ) to comb out after washing.  I also have a step-daughter who has mid back length hair with a personality that I use it on.  This makes the process sooooo much easier and less stressful.  I have not relaxed my hair in about 6 months after relaxing for years every 6-8 weeks.  I went natural years ago but the hubby asked that I relax it because he felt bad for me as he watched me struggle to comb out and style every week without the relaxer in there.  This stuff makes your hair so soft and easy to comb out it is amazing.  Comb out time before twisting, blow-drying, roller-setting, whatever is reduced drastically.  She is 11 and is so happy that she can wash her own hair and comb it out immediately because you can use a comb or a paddle brush with ease. I would highly recommend for those with tighter coiled/textured hair.
B00HFQQ0VU|4|It function as expected. The only problem is that I couldn't find the power requirements, so i expected it to function on 220 V as well. I had to add a power transformer.
B0017JVI9A|3|A bit too perfumey, grama-scented for my tastes (not that I mind how my grama smells!) I am not a person who can wear strong scents and found it a bit too overwhelming for myself.
B001LNOEHA|4|I love this soap, it smells like Pineapples.  You can read the other reviews about the quality of the soap-it is well worth the money.  But I had to delete one star because I purchased this soap as a gift and it arrived dented. Not just a little but a lot dented (it must have been dropped before shipping).  Also it comes in very cheap thin plastic and nothing else. As usual Amazon made it right. Nevertheless I will purchase this product again-but for myself.  I paid $9.44 for a large sized bar.
B004R0INWG|5|I was using the Jan Marini bio-clear and then my doctor introduced me to this product.  LOVE, LOVE it.
B007ISRNCA|5|My niece encouraged me to get a conical styler.  I really love it.  I dumped the plastic glove and purchased a heat resistant glove for dutch oven cooking.  Don't really need it but it's a &#34;nice to have&#34;.
B007RIC79K|5|I love this item.  Good for my skin gives a smooth feeling.  Makes wrinkles less visible and face relaxed and shiny.
B004VTTTQ2|5|The best lotion I have ever tried. I have extremely dry skin, this does wonders for my skin.
B000JNQSIQ|5|It is terrific in every way.
B000QA7HNC|5|Just as advertised and speedy delivery!
B00OFPTN2M|5|We liked the quality of the hair and the length of the braid on this wig. The hair can be combed and re-braided as you see fit. Sizing-wise, this wig is best on a small child (I'd say age 4-5), preferably one who does not have long hair. Because Elsa's hair is pulled back, there isn't too much room for stuffing a lot of hair. Notice that Elsa's hair comes in tight at the brow. And because it is platinum, it is easy for dark hair to peak out and ruin the effect. We've found this to be the case with other Elsa wigs too, so if you've got a daughter with long, dark hair, consider the Dakia Anna wig. The included hair net was of better quality than is shipped with most inexpensive wigs. Nicely packaged too.<br /><br />**We received a free copy of this wig in return for an impartial review.**
B001BO0KMC|5|BEST curling wand i have ever had! LOVE it and i would definitely buy another one!
B005CHHO46|3|There is nothing permanent about this product. I use it daily just to maintain. Cartridges have gone up in price, I buy two approximately every two months. So around $350 a year for cartridges. For me it's better than going in for hair removal treatments.
B000YHQLRK|4|pretty much the same as the body fantasies cotton candy body spray...ok exactly the same.  Oh well, I like the scent anyway...
B0056PP4IM|5|i just purchased this product can some one please list a simple step by step to use this product cuz i have seen so many different ways to apply i did not purchase any of the other products that have been seeing ppl apply loke the protection cream and root cream or whatever cna i just use regular shampoo and conditioner?<br />plz help!!
B00CWTYFVW|5|love it
B00I32AN4K|5|This stuff is beyond amazing! I felt the difference in my hair after one use and I could not wait to shampoo my hair and use again this morning! I would recommend this to anyone. It's easy to use and smells wonderful and really works!
B00L0R5494|5|Perfect, easy starter kit to use. I've never done my own eye shadow but these colors make it easy to teach yourself and all go really well with each other.
B0048AS1J0|5|This was recommended to me by a medical supplier to help make support hose easier to slip on.
B002XQ1XJG|1|I just received this fragrance from Amazon. Everything was sealed, opened the packaged and saw that serial number scratched off the bottle. Tried to get a replacement from Amazon but they said they cannot exchange. DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON
B00607B6VO|4|The seller was prompt and courteous when exchanging the flat iron. The flat iron makes my hair really soft. Only down side is that my hair frizzes faster when compared to other flat irons. It could be b/c I don't t set the flat iron very high at all (usually set at less than  halfway or halfway on the dial), but I don't have to b/c the flat iron gets my hair straight and soft typically in 1 and at most 2 passes. I also have thick, tightly curled ethnic hair. The flat iron is advertised as 1 1/4 inch but is really 1 inch. Flat iron would be better if it had a damp to dry option as well. Better price being sold on Amazon than paying way more on the pyt website + there was free shipping and returns through Amazon Prime.
B003TI0IUM|5|AND THE COLOR IS GREAT!  I ALSO PURCHASED IT IN PLUM & CHOCOLATE.  IT SURE BEATS A PENCIL LINER & PERFECTLY DEFINES YOUR LIPS!

B00GR0SCI4|1|I have cross posted this from the review I posted on the individual bottles.<br />I will start off by saying, I have very finicky hair. Its very very long, and colored bright blood red. I normally have kinda dry hair, but do not dye my hair more than 2 times a year. It's very straight and can sometimes be frizzy.<br />I am also severely allergic to many additives, preservatives, and colors added to almost all food and beauty/health products.<br /><br />I was looking for a VERY MOISTURIZING but organic shampoo/ conditioner and due to the stellar reviews on alba products, I thought I'd give this a go. VERY VERY poor choice on my part.  I used this the first night and woke up expecting to find large bumps, redness or burning on my shoulders/scalp (I have come to expect this when trying a new product) but to my surprise, it did not harm me at all!<br />HOWEVER. I went to work that day and notice that underneath my hair, I kept having to detangle a large knot that seemed to just respawn in 15 minutes. My hair felt very dry, brittle and frizzy. I clipped part of it back thinking it was just because of being down, ect.<br />When I got home later that night, I went to comb my hair before bed and OH MY GOD....it was just a HUGE knotted dry mess!! I couldn't get a comb through my hair in any part without hearing the terrifying sound of large knots catching! I already have relatively fragile hair due to being long, and dyed so I was frantically combing repair argan oil though my stands and trying to gently detangle the bird nest that had formed.<br />I jumped in the shower and rinsed the argan oil, used some apple cider vinegar and left in a Mill Creek conditioner that I had from before I tried this one.<br />When My hair dried, I could see the damage that was done in just one day. It looked frizzy where it was tangled and felt dry. After about 3 days of argan oil, and conditioning with Mill Creek's products, I noticed it began to look more smooth and shiny again.<br /><br />In short, I have to say, this is the worst product I have ever put in my hair. I would rather have redness on my scalp then a matted-dry knotted mess of a mane. NEVER AGAIN!n short, I have to say, this is the worst product I have ever put in my hair. I would rather have redness on my scalp then a matted-dry knotted mess of a mane. NEVER AGAIN!
B005CGREGA|5|Legitimate product, not a counterfeit. And one of my favourite scents. Long wearing, very aromatic and a touch on the sweet side. If you like armani aqua de gio etc you'll like this. Also great value, huge bottle for 40 dollars.
B00009YJSJ|5|While it may not be the most powerful or versatile hair dryer available, it is certainly the most convenient.  I bought this as a replacement for the exact same model that lasted several years.  My wife wanted this one replaced when the plastic internal fan blades broke apart, but that was after 5-10 years of regular use.  My wife has one or two others that have specialty attachments  and are probably more powerful, but this is the one that she uses as the primary one, because it is always right there, nothing to pull out and plug in etc. It's just there and it is powerful enough to handle most every requirement. I use it infrequently but my short hair is dry in less than a minute.
B0009OAGOW|5|This Classic Scent is Timeless.  I've used this for 30 years with joy.  The suttle hints of citrus and herbs blend to make a sofisticated airomatic scent.
B0080CO2F4|4|I bought this crystal peacock hair clip for my niece to go with the matching bracelet. It is so colorful and I could see using it as a scarf clip, as well. The price was very reasonable and I would recommend this to anyone who likes bling!
B008WBLYS6|5|Love this soap as I have bought this several times and I am in the process of buying more.<br /><br />When we get bitten by any type of bug, we wash the bite with this soap as we try to keep this on hand for the bites or just a good cleansing from head to toe. The sulfur is not too strong of a smell.<br /><br />This soap is safe enough to wash the hair, face and the entire body! It is a little expensive but it works fine for our use.
B00JTOYMVG|5|Awesome
B000JNQSIQ|5|Work as advertised. I cannot use a razor since I have very sensitive skin so these clippers help in that department. Lots of accessories come with it and I love the price I paid for them at the time, $16.99. Can't be beat.
B00CYA5E1O|2|Not really worth it. I should of spent a little more to get a clarsonic.
B005A4P236|5|I love this color. Amd OPI is my favorite brand. I'll be back for more. Stay on longer than other brands.
B005M2C6PS|5|Nothing better on the market that I have come across. This is the beat hairwax available. Hair prone to buildup should probably avoid this
B003CGN8SA|5|this oil is awesome.  thank you for the speedy delivery
B000VS2HYS|5|Crest Glide has always been my favorite. The floss almost never get stuck in between my teeth and always leaves a fresh minty taste afterwards. Will definitely buy again.
B00GI222GY|5|Best I have found
B00I1ISDZM|5|Thank you! I really like this mud mask. I'm a guy, and this is my first mask of any kind. But I definitely notice the effects. After I use it, my skin looks and feels better. (I'm still ugly, but I didn't expect it to fix that.)<br /><br />Best of all - the seller actually called me after I received it to see if I had any questions. That's so nice! I really appreciate the extra customer service.<br /><br />Thanks again!
B00JYKBZ3I|4|Good to me :)
B003UNPS0Q|5|Its Kenra.  Need i say more?  this product does help dry my hair faster, not lightening speed mind you but its definately faster. I have medium texture hair.   It feels super silky in my hair too.  I also like the fact that it is a heat protector,  my hair doesnt seem as dry as it did before i starting using.  I use it everyday.  If there is a bigger size than the 3.4oz I will buy it next time.  Get it, you'll like it.
B003NUNRBS|1|I ordered this product from Beauty Perfect and it came right away but it didn't even last one month.  I only used one pump in the am and one in the pm and at first the red serum wouldn't come out and shortly after that not even the white serum would come out. Don't buy it from them.  It is a waste of money.  I contacted them and told them perhaps the pump was defective and I would return the product to get at least a partial credit and they wouldn't even return my email.  Buy it from a reputable doctor's office where you know you are getting your money's worth.
B00D6XJ3KG|5|Great product, this is my go to product for treating my adult acne.  Yes it is drying, but for me it is what works.
B002UL6XKS|5|These were not cheap, and it is a strange item to buy in the first place. These were a lot higher than ebay and junk store versions.<br /><br />However, the design and execution of this version of the product made up for it, I think.<br /><br />Also, they were shipped in a reasonable amount of time and packaged well to prevent damage.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon for items like this!
B00DMZ3XUO|5|Beautiful
B00G3TMFD2|5|Stays long in my hair and eventually fades to a color that still looks OK. Hair is soft and smooth are using it. Wish they offered ash shade of dark brown.
B0036BI56G|5|i love this.<br />My skin feels like a baby skin in a few days!!!!<br />however.. i can't buy this anymore...<br />I am a college student and there is no way i can fit this thing in my budget.<br /><br />but it works like wonder.
B003JFBXMM|5|Perfect!  Good value.
B0058JYT78|4|I feel much fresher and cleaner after using it. I don't know how much it's whitening my teeth, though. Good product.
B0026IBSVE|5|i used it only once and will use it again on sunday, but for using it for the first time, it cuts and trims very well. the operation is smooth, not loud, and the vibration is minimal. i did have the same kit 3 years ago and after dropping it twice, i needed to replace it. the only thing i would point out is do not loose the oil and the brush. those two tools will help last the buzzer for a long time.
B004CQXZ5U|5|I use these cloths every morning and night. They work so much better than your fingers, and I like the fact that I don't have tons of washcloths lying around.<br /><br />The Good: They leave your face feeling squeaky clean without being too harsh.<br />The Bad: They are too big. To save money, I cut them into fourths.<br />The Comparison: These are my favorite facial cloths because they aren't pre-moistened.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.
B00HA77WLG|5|Works great for my son that has very bad acne
B00128J2YO|5|I was a little worried when it said 3.4 oz but the picture said 1.7 oz but after all it is 3.4. It also comes on time, looks great. I don't use it cause I bought it as a present so not sure about the quality. But good service anyway.
B00J7WDJHI|5|large size, wonderful product. Would highly suggest buying from this seller. Got 5 scents from the seller and have to say i am very impressed.
B00JI7AI3A|1|While I love the neck cream - was disappointed in the eye cream.<br />Not a great product.  But to be realistic it might not work for me and do wonders for others.
B001126XLQ|5|very pleased with color.
B0009OAHKA|5|best cologne i own
B0008GGH58|4|I don't make candles but I do make wood projects. The size and shape of these refills are perfect for waxing plane soles.  Mike -- [...]
B000UZEQFU|5|Just what I wanted. It fits and works and was a good price.
B00OZWE3AW|5|I would recommend!<br /><br />At first I noticed it has a great scent, not too strong and natural. It lathered up well in the water and a little bit went a long way. It was easy to wash off in the shower and left my skin feeling smooth and clean. The polish is amazing, I will be definitely be continuing to buy this in the future.
B005MG86TY|4|Just used to replace one of my nails after having a manicure 2 weeks ago, bought everything to do a complete manicure and as yet have not done it, so far the base and top coat did the job, happy with these items.
B00CZH3FGM|5|This is such a cool and convenient way to upgrade a toothbrush.  I am considering it giftable.  This set is a tote packed with the top of the line Oral B 4000. My dentist has actually recommended the Oral B electric toothbrushes to me.  Your teeth feel so clean, you tend to smile more.  This toothbrush also comes with 4 settings, but typically I keep it on whitening.  My teeth do look whiter, and I feel like I am attacking my stains on all fronts.  The genius of this set is that it comes with replacement heads.  This is a huge convenience to me, and the way I want to purchase toothbrushes going forward.  Plus there are other goodies, toothpaste, mouthwash, whitening strips—you feel like you are getting an insane value.<br /><br />My only compliant on this brush has always been charge time; the charge lasts for several days but not more.  Be prepared to constantly keep this charging and to take the charging station with you when you travel.
B002HSM6BO|5|Makes you smell like your dad after a hair cut
B00IS6XPQY|3|It was a gift for my mom. She says it doesn't work as well as other products she's tried before. Bummer.
B008GRR21O|3|Its an OK wig for the money. I bought it to mess with because I'm going to be bald in a few years. Shake it out, wear a hat, it'll look pretty real.
B003TW9SE0|5|Great deodorant.  When showering, it washes off easy, which is why I purchased this item.
B0000DK5LW|5|Bought for my wife! She live it. She removes hair under her chin where it is hard to see. She loves it!
B0056IJRV4|5|I really love the soft  clean scent of this lotion. It leaves your skin feeling soft And smooth. I will order  more soon
B003S516XO|5|One of my new favorite flat irons. I have nice, fine and middle back length hair so it only takes me 30 minutes to straighten my hair.<br /><br />I would purchase again if I have too. I also have the Remington curling wand which is very good.
B004Q8GYES|1|Doesnt really clear up face or anything like that. Constantly having to change foam pad since I have really bad acne. A scrub would probably clean your face better than this product. This product is only good for massaging your face and thats about it!!
B008LOI2X4|5|Love it!
B00K0LUG2G|5|Love it
B00C0XWH06|5|I just love the textures and feel of the bracelet. It is very pretty and unusual. Can't go wrong with this bracelet
B004KEON0U|5|Inexpensive but definitely not cheap. You may use this alone or with your favourite perfume for the layered effect. This product is great to use alone as well as it is long lasting. Best when used after your bath and shower. It is like a pheromone.
B0065FE488|5|I received these very fast. They are adorable. I will order more from this company.  11 11 11 1 1
B001IMSIYY|5|This product gives your hair a no significant different feeling then the Wen Cleansing Conditioner but lets face it we need the deep conditioning that the Wen Re Moist Mask Intensive Hair Treatment gives. If you only used the Wen Cleansing Conditioner then the only difference is your pocket book because this is a lot cheaper. I buy this and the Wen Re Moist Mask until someone makes a generic version of that too.
B00O14R17Q|5|daughter just had baby .Works well
B0006Q01PC|5|I have four little dogs, and I use these to clean their eyes/snouts every morning.  I'm able to gently clean the corners of their eyes without leaving any fibers behind, which was sometimes a problem with typical cotton squares.  They are also much softer than gauze, and less expensive.  I wet them with saline solution to make sure I don't irritate their eyes.  Whereas with the cotton squares the dogs would squirm and fight me (because it would take longer, and more wiping to really clean their eyes/snouts), these wipes are so efficient and gentle all of the puppies just stand still, as they know how fast it will be. Mornings are a quick snout swipe for each dog, a few minutes of brushing, and then off to breakfast.  These wipes really help me do an effective job to make sure my puppies are clean every day.  Four paws up!
B0009MFUPO|5|The new cutters were long overdue - they returned the shaver to 'like new' performance.<br />However, inside the padded envelope was only the cutters - NO PAPERWORK whatsoever.
B0041HTTA0|4|Satisfactory.I will order again as necessary.
B000W8JZII|5|I've suffered since I was a kid from dry and irritated red skin around the bridge of my nose, under my eyes on my cheeks, and between my eyes on the forehead area.  I also deal with really dry flaky skin around my mustache and goatee areas when I shave, and the opposite with itchy, red irritated skin if I let my facial hair grow out in the slightest.  So, I've been between a rock and a hard place for many years because of it.  Even though I'm a guy and not really self conscious about it, it does drive me crazy and can be very annoying to have your skin in a constant state of irritation.  My grandmother has probably bought me every Avon lotion that has ever existed to try and none of that ever worked.<br /><br />My wife works as a cosmetologist and a manager for a national chain, so she can get access to professional product samples and buy them in larger sizes than what's offered to the public at discounted rates.  Well, she brought me home a small sample of this Bioelements Sensitive Skin Cleanser.  It gave me enough to work into my cheeks and forehead and the effects were immediate.  It left my skin feeling soothed, had a slight cooling sensation(sort of like a mild Icy Hot), and my skin felt dry(not flaky) as well as super smooth.<br /><br />I asked my wife to go ahead and buy me a bottle, so she bought me 16oz bottle and I began washing my face everyday with the product.  I just keep it in the shower, pump a few squirts of the oil, massage into my face and rinse.  After the first two days, there was a dramatic reduction in the redness in my face that was noticeable by everyone.  My skin is no longer irritated, and there is no more dry flaky skin all over my facial hair areas of my face.  If your a guy and have suffered like I have with these same symptoms, I strongly recommend this product.
B008J2NM3S|1|It didnt remove my hair and it pulled.  I would not recommend this product.
B00CFTEDYI|3|Another Sublime Beauty cream. I'm not a fan of the smell of this one. Since I'm in my 50's, I'll continue to use this. I don't think I've had it long enough to know if it is making a difference.
B000P20V0M|5|They are all the real thing at a fraction of Dept. Stores prices;I recommended the perfumes to many of my friends and acquintances.
B009Z60OA6|5|Yep! love this flavor. Love that I found it online as the stores haven't sold it in months. Yay!
B00TYMEJ9S|3|Bought as a package. Next time I'll buy individually. I life the eyeliner and eye shadow very much but not a fan of the mascara or coverup.
B00BPAO48S|2|Don't really care for this.  It's very soft and there really isn't much in the package.  The smell is ok.  I don't like perfumery smells so this works along that line.  It's not my favorite but it's really a matter of taste.
B00538TSMU|3|Good for the price. Not real, however good for a night out.  Only used one pair.  Not bad.
B00IIZG80U|5|I use these gloves while driving. They are nice and also it's easy to use your phone if you need too.
B005WI7B2U|1|Saw no change, except lots of itching of the scalp
B00I4A9PMM|5|I've been using Revitalash for the past month and I can definitely see a noticeable change in the length of my lashes. I've tried Latisse before but it was too strong for me and made my eyes red, swollen and itchy. (I am still using Latisse on my eyebrows though, which doesn't seem to bother me.)     Revitalash hasn't irritated my eyes at all. I'm loving finally having longer lashes without any irritation or other negative side effects!     P.S. This is Graham's wife's review. Of course Graham is a typical guy who has long lashes and doesn't need any help.  ;)
B008XWYBF2|4|This is my first product from this brand (bareMinerals).<br />I decided to buy it because I love and use a lot of makeup that even with a lot of care is damaging my skin (Supposedly mineral products are lighter).<br />On first use I can say I liked the cover and the product had a good fixation on the skin.<br />The application was easy but it didnt came with a sponge or brush. The price was not the best but the product is also a factor 20 sunscreen.
B000K7MDGW|5|Nice and worth the money.
B000050FDX|5|This combo perfectly replaced old parts.<br />I'm very satisfied with the quality. Now my Brown works as new or even better :)!
B00OPA0L5K|5|I love this soap! Very fresh smelling, pleasant and invigorating. Lathers well and the packaging is an added adorable bonus. An added bonus to this soap is that it is made in the USA. Win, win all the way around.
B002PMSVIO|1|I just used the Medium brown and it made my hair BLACK!! I had to use a color removal kit and recolor my hair. This is a terrible product!! Do not buy this. This was my first try and I will never do it again. I will stick with Revlon Colorsilk. You can trust the color and it is prices 1/2 of this product.
B00LXTX4EQ|1|Smell is good but make dry skin after use it<br />I returned them
B00N6G36WE|4|Got this to cover grey's in eyebrows, still have to use a pencil a bit to cover but this hold brows in place and doesn't run at all.....might give better coverage in a darker color - I got the lighter brown cuz I was worried about looking too made up - might try darker brown next
B001FB5HDI|5|Great price for a great natural and healthy cosmetic/personal care product! This is by far the best toothpaste I have found. My kids love it and Amazon price beats that of competitors.
B00NOMGOYC|5|This is berry moisturizing!!! Acai'nt get enough of it.
B00BX9GPRO|5|love
B0018AGB7M|4|Easy installation, easy operation.  Since it is entirely plastic, I don't know how long it will last, and I wish it pulsed more like a normal waterpik, but I do use it every morning when I shower.
B00O2A61JS|5|This is wonderful! I love the lemony scent. My skin loves it too. I  really like this brand.
B000ARDBH2|5|EXCELENTE...
B000L596FE|5|All the bristles slowly fell out of my 20 year old brush that gently detangles my hair. I have bought 5 brushes, over that time period, in hopes they could replace this old deteriorating brush. None could do it. I was down to less than half the bristles and a ripping pad when I found this brush. Gave it a try and it works BETTER than the one I held onto for so long. Now my long hair is safe and will quit breaking off. I love it.
B00771UGV8|5|the smell is amazing just need a bigger bottle, the scents lasts almost all day will definitely buy again would be awesome if it was cheaper tho
B000E7WHLY|1|I bought this cologne for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day because he loves the way it smells. It was perfect for the price and he loved it. For the first week it was ok but I noticed the scent faded faster than when he had this cologne before. About a week ago the top cracked into two pieces (it was not dropped) out of nowhere and you could tell that the two pieces had been glued together which the authentic bottle does not have. Now I feel like the cologne is fading faster when he puts it on and barely smells to begin with. I am highly dissatisfied with this product and will never buy cologne from amazon again.
B00THESCSW|5|Love it!
B00D6TQLBO|5|i love this works so easy rolled right up into a big bun and stays nice and tight on my head!!
B0006M56BK|5|As expected
B00V6HTURU|2|I really like it unfortunately the press button on /off very easy get stuck  . It broken after a month I used it.
B00SFQQGSG|5|Bought these for vacation. I bought one set for the sailboat and 1 set for the hotels. The suction cups on the back will be perfect to put them up out of the way in the head on board.
B0089JVDPK|4|I would say these are the second best cleansing clothes I've used.  What really surprised me about these is how moist they are.  I hate that most of the brands I've tried are really dry.  These actually had bubbles on them when I pulled them out of the package, that's how saturated they are with product!  They are a nice texture, great for a light scrub but not abrasive.  The smell is nothing overwhelming or offensive.  The thing that I dislike about these is that they seem to really dry my skin out.  The other ones I like, yes to cucumbers, is a really moisture rich cloth.  These promise moisture but they really don't deliver.  It doesn't bother me too much because I use a separate cream every night after cleansing.  I would definitely buy these again and will continue to try more ponds products.
B00KX1ZX9E|4|It is nice. The item came which wasn't broken or missing rhinestone. I was worried about broking while shipping but it came nice. Thank you
B00PL4UDH0|1|these are terrible.  don't last even 1 session.
B006MNILCS|4|Razor size is perfect.  So much better than the 5 blade razors that you can't shave half your mustache with because they are too big.  The feel is good but wish it had just a little more weight to it.  Much better than the disposables though!  Most importantly you can't find the 3 blade handles any more in the stores since all they sell are the 5 blade and disposables.
B0077SNY42|4|The toner is pretty good. When I check the ingredients though, I saw this called 'Benzoyl Alcohol' and its basically stuff that adds smell or perfume to your facial lotions, makeup creams, etc. I think the pleasant smell was a little too much plus alcohol isn't good for your skin whatsoever. It's gonna dry your skin badly if you have dry skin and may irritate.
B0007P2OMK|5|I know wet shavers consider these pucks kind of low end but I like them. Laters easily and is plenty slick. Smells great too. I find the more expensive creams that explode into thick lather don't last as long and the thicker lather just clogs up my razor faster. Fit right into my shaving mug without any trimming also. Great value.
B0064QVBFC|4|Works great as toothpaste, but not for its intended use.
B00H59IA8S|5|After buying this at Burlington and using it for the first time tonight I must say my dark circles that were under my eyes are gone! I then wanted to know how much this product was selling for at other places. After coming on here and seeing it was for $25 I knew I got a great deal, but then I read the review about black mold in the product. WELL after being paranoid and researching ALL the ingredients, I am happy to report there is NO black mold in the product!!! Although, it took a few hours, I now know everything that is in it.
B001V9OWNU|4|Yesss!!...I used the sulfur powder, mixed w/ Olive oil & tea tree oil to relieve hair scalp dryness & itching. So far, so good!!... It was worth the buy!!...☺
B002N5MI3C|5|Awesome
B000C49RXA|5|This works! It didn't dry out my skin or cause it to flake and peel. No redness. I haven't had skin this clear since childhood! One side note, the hydrogen peroxide cream made my eyebrows lighter--oops! Just remember not to get it on your eyebrows and you'll be fine!
B005GLSDN4|5|I use this product for my skin and it keeps me very soft.  This is absorbed very well and doesn't lay on your skin like some oils do.
B008Z3ST16|3|The triple does exactly what it was designed to do.  But for me it is a little more aggressive (cuts too much at just one pass) than I thought it would be but I just have to remind myself to *go easy* and everything works out okay.
B00336EUTK|5|The Crest 3D white strips really do work. I had noticeable results within a week. Just follow the instructions on the box.
B00IJEDL9Q|5|great!
B001KYUA2S|5|This lip gloss is perfect for me.I have very fair skin and anything with a lot of colour looks cheap on me.I bought this gloss in 105 \\"born with it\\" it's a really subtle natural looking pink.It plumps your lips slightly and tingles a bit when you put it on(I like the feeling of the tingling though)It is a discontinued product,Unfortunatly every make up I really love always seems to become discontinued:( Thank goodness for Amazon and Chasity's cosmetics!It shipped to me super fast and I couldn't be happier to have my favorite lip stuff back:)
B008X0LA12|2|These are made well, but the elastic is not strong enough to hold the hair inside of them
B0050QJ1HM|5|I've been looking for this iron for a couple of years and decided to look on remington.com<br />I sure was suprised to see it pop up. Thank you so much.<br />  A well satisfied custoner.<br />  Barb
B003UH1Q3U|5|What can I say? This product is simply an exact replacement for the original head. It's fine!
B00AW691P2|5|This line of beauty care of Dr. Dennis Gross has gone through many name changes and packaging changes in the past several years.  I'm guessing for marketing reason.  It started out as MD Skincare by Dr. Dennis Gross to now just Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare.<br /><br />Another example, this particular product it has gone through a complete name change for their moisture tint from Moisture Tint in a white and orange bottle to now CC Cream in a beige bottle even though they are the same product.  I only take time to mention this because I have had a challenging time with reordering because I'm not always sure I am reordering the same product.  BUT...I do love this product line anyway.<br /><br />This moisture tint is something I have used for years (6+).  It is light to apply, absorbs beautifully and gives good coverage without the heavy feel of foundation.  Even though it is SPF 18 I recommend using a SPF lotion base (GloTherapeutics) under the tint to be sure that you are getting the sun protection your face needs.<br /><br />I also think it every important to lightly exfoliate your skin every morning and use a good vitamin C serum before applying the tint.  If you search my reviews you will fine the vitamin C that I use and love it's called Earth's Glow Vitamin C Serum also sold of course right here on Amazon.
B006HJR2Q8|5|I got it on time, a very nice colour! very good quality  and texture, I recomand it for summer fun!
B002HP1HEE|3|Too light
B001GSQ5YK|5|I bought this mainly because it seems more natural to me than other brand name products out there and I was surprised that this was actually quite lovely. It adds a subtle hint of shade with a bit of sparkle. I don't really need a whole lot of product to add the effect.
B008Z0TC0Q|5|We wanted to go back to basics and find an organic hand soap. The smell of this soap is amazing. I love it and it doesn't dry out my hands.  Highly recommend it.
B00ECBTFAY|4|It does what supposed to do . Avoid the ear to get burn!  I just wish it was a bit more confortable .
B0046797WK|5|Best mascara I have ever used. Can't seem to find it in stores anymore :(
B0036FTEIU|5|Bought this as a gift for my mother. She loved it!
B0068G8EZ8|5|Everything perfect
B00BN7FFBI|5|Love, love, love my Boots #7!  I'm hooked--it works fast and effectively.
B003S17772|5|Their very light and look very real when I put them on definitely buying them again soon I love these lashes.
B00HE881JS|1|Got Wat I paid for👌
B0018A32XS|3|It does a fair job, just have to keep going over the areas, it doesn't chafe or pull. I would recommend it.
B0037HP9OA|1|The pivoting head on the shaver is uncomfortable and inconsistent. The pivoting head nicked me on several occasions. So If that was corrected this would be an awesome product.  I love having the convenience of the groomer on the other end.
B000GCKALQ|4|It was what I expected
B001B0YMB6|5|Sturdy and we'll put together.  It exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend it.
B00023IXPE|5|I LOVE this stuff and have worn it for over 30 years. When I was a girl, my first little bottle was a prized posession bought by my mother who stood in line for hours to get some German imports (in Riga, Latvia, 1970's). It's still a staple fragrance for me and hasn't lost its' charm.   No wonder, it's been winning raves since 1720's. It's not too sickly or synthetic and really makes me get up and go. (yes, I do let my husband steal it.)
B004TGUKG0|4|I usually don't write product reviews but for this one I felt I had to. There are soooo many epilators available out there and I read the reviews on many of them before making my decision to purchase this one. Everyone has their favorite and I think with an epilator, you get out of it what you put in. I received my Braun SE 7181 yesterday and briefly tried it out on the back of my hand to see how it felt. It wasn't too bad so I felt like I could proceed to my legs when I was ready. I have read a lot of reviews with complaints of ingrown hair after epilating and I have had this happen to me after waxing many years ago, so I went out to Rite Aid and got myself a loofah pad for $2.49 and will make sure I use it regularly to exfoliate my skin so that this does not happen to me again. When I arrived home from work tonight I epilated my lower legs for the first time. I'm not going to lie, it definitely hurts, but it was completely tolerable. I last shaved my legs this past Sunday, and had short stubbly growth. I have very dark, thick and course hair. I believe that the shorter the hair, the better. I can't imagine doing this with a forest growing on my legs, it would definitely hurt way too much. I also noticed that if  you pull your skin very taut, it helps with the pain as well. I had to make several passes over each area I did, but the light really helps in seeing what you missed, and the more hair you clear out, the less it hurts in that area. For me the trick seems to be pulling my skin very tight and moving the epilator in short but slower strokes. Now I know that no one wants to prolong the torture but I found that if I picked it up off my skin too quickly, it was breaking the hairs rather than pulling them out. I got through both lower legs in about 1/2 hour and the epilator seems to have plenty of battery life left.  My legs are a lot more smooth than when I started, but there is still some stubble left which I expected since hair grows at different rates. I am going to keep up the epilating every other day or so and I feel that with time, I will need to do it less and less. I have been shaving my legs for probably 25 years, and I definitely do not expect a miracle after one use. After the epilation my legs are red and splotchy which I expected as well. I am sure that they will be back to normal in the morning. I wiped them down with a cool washcloth and moisturized them with pure coconut oil. I do NOT recommend using any type of lotion or cream afterward as I feel it would burn. Organic virgin coconut oil is totally natural, very soothing, has antibacterial properties, and is a great moisturizer. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase so far and will try to post updates as I go along.
B00KUYXU80|5|Love these Wet n Wild Lipsticks!!!!!!!!!! Love the colors. This is an identical dupe of MAC Rebel and I love it!!!!!!!!!
B001LQY1X4|4|This hair dryer is fast, and compact. It has a high and low setting, and gets the job done effectively because it has such a strong blow. The only problem I had with it, is that the back end of it kept sucking in my hair, and it resulted in it giving off the smell of burning hair, and accompanied by it no longer working as well as it could, after 3 weeks of having it. The only reason why I gave it a 4 and not a three is because you and me both have the responsibility of keeping our hair away from the back end of the hair dryer. The reason why it does not have a 5 is because, although it is very strong, could not handle a few pieces of hair getting into the fan part, which is understandable, but still an engineering flaw. It's golden for travel, and great for short-term usage.
B008MJ1V3G|5|Delivery was fast! Awesome light! Must try!:)
B00103DFSU|2|I don't see anything special about this product.  I'm using it as a hand cream now because I have more useful face products for my 50+ y.o. skin/face...<br /><br />It does list good skin care ingredients.  Maybe I'm just too quick to judge on this.  But personally, I won't buy it again.  (It doesn't really have a scent, tho, so if you have sensitive skin or don't like fragrances, this might be a good cream for you.)
B00I5VGIHU|4|I've been using this eye cream for two weeks.  I like the texture.  It looks thick but glides onto skin smoothly and leaves the eye area soft and supple.  Absorbs completely.  I can't honestly say that I've noticed a significant decrease in lines, but I do like using this cream.  I don't have dark circles and can't say if it would reduce them.  Overall, not miraculous, but at my age (60), nothing short of plastic surgery is miraculous.  It might work better on younger skin to prolong  a youthful appearance.
B0040UV0YG|5|ive been suing this shade for like 3 years now LOL  i love it suuuperr cuteeee just need to apply lip balm here and there but overall the color is tres beautiful!!! heheh :)
B0062A47VU|5|I tried the Dermorganic shampoo because it was recommended to me and I loved it so I ordered the Dermorganic Daily Hydrating Conditioner. I was using an other conditioner with the shampoo until this one came and it was night and day! Using them both together is what works. My comb goes thru my hair like butter when I wash it and my hair is half way to my waist and baby fine. I rarely have any tangles at all. Its the best combination I have ever had. I also added the Argan Oil Treatment with it and it will always be in my shower as long as it is available!
B00HDZGF4K|5|I love the vitamin C serum.  My skin feels wonderful & after a few weeks, I think my skin looks great too.
B0062IWQVU|5|I went into this experience pretty skeptical. Most trimmers/stylers say they do all this stuff but done. Not with this pro glide styler!!<br /><br />It provided a smooth shave and the trimmer ( which comes with three guards) worked wonders!!! It fit to the contours of my body and didn't knick or cut my skin. The motor isn't loud which is great! I would defiantly recommend this to anyone who likes to keep their body clean shaved and smooth.
B004YNJZUA|3|The topsy tail's are fine, but the package says five count, meaning two topsy tails and three worthless ponytail holders. It would be nice if the product description specified that.
B003YW0XXA|4|This product is great after using the Cre-C Shampoo for people wih thinning hair. It helps new growth. Small problem, it does not detangle hair as much as I wanted.
B00H5HYKI4|2|The design is cute...but the size is too small!  Should have had more info to determine that.
B003K2RMSS|5|I have to say this product does work. I have been using it for years now.<br />It all started probably ten years ago, I had long hair and it was falling at a very fast rate, I started seeing patches with little hair. I even cut my hair to see if that would help, but every time I took a shower, I found hair everywhere.<br />My father has very little hair, he has fought against baldness for years, so I thought I should try to do something.<br /><br />Now, after many years, I can say that it works, my hair is thicker, stronger, and not falling anymore. I use it every other year for maintenance purposes.<br /><br />It is expensive, but totally worth it, even though it probably won't work the same for everybody.<br /><br />It does not grow hair, but keeps the hair you have in place.<br /><br />Hope this review helps others.
B00AJS8N4I|4|Brushes serves the purpose.
B004R662QY|5|I ordered this with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised by how much I like it.  The such cups actually grip our stone countertops and keeps the dryer out of the sink
B001QTW2FK|4|This little hair dryer is very light-weight, nice & small for traveling and just as nice for every day use. It is quite powerful for being so small but drys my hair in no time at all. I love the travel bag that comes with it.
B00BZU2PVG|2|The perfume is lovely. It came about 2 weeks late and I paid for faster shipping. It was a present for my Grandmother who was visiting. It came after she left. Very disappointing.
B00I624YRY|3|really irritated my eyes after a couple of days
B001XURHBQ|5|The scent is enjoyable and nice for the fall or winter time.  The container is easy to travel with, but because of its size it gets sudsy and a bit messy.
B0030O3VRW|5|when I first got this, I put it on to try it out. However, I hadn't waited for it to dry. So my eye shadow rubbed off. I was upset. Then I found out you have to wait for it to dry before applying your shadow. It works MIRACLES.
B001ET7G9E|5|This is an excellent toothpaste for controlling bad breath. I'm very satisfied with it after two years of use. Recommended.
B007OUMS1I|5|Really like the product
B0041K5I48|5|Living Proof shampoo fulfills all of its promises. Your hair comes alive, it shines, it stays cleaner longer--I've never used a shampoo this good before. I don't remember how I chanced upon Living Proof, maybe I saw an article about it, where the developers explained in detail about all of the research that went in to making their products. I do remember that they 'pitched' it to Jennifer Anniston, who fell in love with the way it made her hair feel and look. I also seem to remember that she invested in the company, but cannot advertise for them because of contracts she has with another cosmetic brand. I do remember, she loves the shampoo.  So do I.  Of course I'm not beautiful, I don't have a gorgeous head of hair like Anniston does, but I can say that Living Proof fulfills its promise of a new life and lift for your hair. I am so pleased with it that I've purchased the shampoo and conditioner for my daughter and my two little granddaughters to use. They like it too. I hope Living Proof hits drug store and other store shelves, so that more women can use this great shampoo, as well as the conditioner and setting lotions.
B0018662UW|5|I love this cream.  I get it at Bed Bath & Beyond.  I've used all sorts of night creams (nivea, olay, clinique) and this is by far the best.  I wake up and think my skin actually looks softer and fresher.
B00JSACNMG|5|There are many different uses for this product. I decided to use it mainly to moisturize. I found that it was a very light oil, and that it was not greasy at all so it was able to absorb into my skin/hair quickly which i liked. I thought that it worked great to moisturize my hair, skin, and even nails! I used in on my hair by just warming up a bit of the oil in the microwave, and then smoothed it onto my hair. It really made my hair shine! I loved the effect that it gave. I used in on my skin to moisturize, simply by dropping a few drops onto my hands and then massaging it onto my skin. While researching this product, i found out that it can have great anti aging benefits and also can help with scars and acne! More on that later in this post. The final way i use this product is just to moisturize my cuticles/nails. All i do for this is drop a tiny bit onto my fingertips and then i just massaged it into each nail. It seemed to help my cuticles from being dry, and over time i hope it will help my nails become stronger and less likely to break!<br /><br />Another quick random thought: To me, it kinda smells like tea! The scent didnt bother me though, it isnt overpowering.
B00642AC74|5|I JUST got my wand yesterday and used it right away & OH EM GEE it is fantastic. I loveeee it. I didn't even use hair spray and today my hair woke up with the curls. And I'm a Latina, I have curly hair and I usually flat iorn it and use my regular clip curling iorn but I have to use hair spray for the curls to stay for atlst 2hrs. I am obsessed with this wand. Totally recoment it. I have pictures of my hair on Intragram @xo.gloryy :)
B00OPF6DVQ|5|What can I say, this is my second set of lamora brushes and I love them. They blend so well and don't shed at all!! The softest brushes I have ever had. I loved  the white color of brushes and the container they come in is very handy. The only suggestion I would give is to label these brushes like the 10 piece set are labeled.
B000XEZ35A|4|I love these gloves and how they help to exfoliate my skin. I also like the azulene oil that comes with the gloves as it helps to keep my skin soft and supple.
B001Q85672|5|One of the best ones I have found. Doesn't break me out like some of them do. The color is spot on and feels good.
B007HJ9VFM|1|when you use the nose trimmer, it's clogs and stops constantly. You have to turn it off and take the top off and reset it and than do it over and over again to get it to work. stopped using nose trimmer. because it is to much hassle to mess with
B0095IMNI0|5|Compact, good quality, good price.  I like having everything in one place.
B004OL0ZSI|1|this is the hair that I get from my local beauty supply store...It is decent, but is good for only 1 wear...which is NOT virgin indian remy quality!!! it feels nice, but after it is won after about 2 weeks it turns ugly!
B00756HQNQ|5|makes lite work on my feet
B000K3I8CE|5|Good for the skin.
B00AQX7CI4|4|This product was not exactly what I was expecting. It is very watery, but it woerks really well. It leaves your skin feeling very soft. There isn't much of a smell to it, but overall I would recommend this product.
B00I9267YO|5|All I can say is wow, My face felt so dry and I put this on it and it immediately felt soft and smooth. I honestly thought it would take a little bit to absorb but nope, instant relied. Not only that it seemed to give my face a glow. I absolutely love this and would recommend it to anyone. I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review
B000FZEPYW|3|Packaging was good. But, I opened up the little Surgi box and the lid was half closed, kind of ajar. Did this happen to anyone else?<br /><br />I'm really nervous about waxing myself, since this is my first time. I read the directions over twice. So, there are no strips or anything to remove the wax with. I'm assuming we yank the wax off.<br /><br />I'm going to try it now, and will come back with an update.<br /><br />**Update**<br /><br />Omg, I have no idea what I'm doing. The lip of my jar is covered in dry, hard wax, the wax drys fast and I think I pull the wax off too early because it doesn't take off all of my hair.
B003NSPOF2|5|Both like this face lotion. One is over 50 and the other just 13! Great purchase. Will buy again soon.
B00GR4TPW2|5|I was expecting this pallets to be heavier for some reason but nonetheless, its the shades that are of importance; the colours are beautiful for my skin tone and I am of African decent.
B0021Y1SCW|5|[[ASIN:B0021Y1SCW Bariatric Bath Chair With Back Each]]  I highly recommend this bath chair for use in the shower.  This product is very helpful in bathing in the shower over the tub.  I previously had a bath stool which was rated for the same weight (250 lbs.) but it broke after only a few weeks of use.  It was bought at a local store.  I have been using the chair from Amazon for a few weeks now.  It is sturdy and comfortable to sit on.  One of the things I particularly like about it is the bracing of the legs.  The cross bracing makes it sturdier than chairs without this bracing.  Also this chair only cost a few dollars more than the first one I bought - which broke!  I recommend this product as a helpful aid for those under 250 lbs. who need to sit all or part of the time when taking a shower.  Enjoy!
B00MMO72B2|3|the product does work but the amount of product you get is like a sample size product that you would get for free. So I was not that happy with this product because to fully review a product you must be able to use it a few times
B00E96XELS|5|I generally apply eye cream only once per day so I use a lot more than is directed, with no ill effects. I really like this product and will continue to use it, but at least initially, the first time you apply it, USE AS DIRECTED! I applied.. a lot, as I customarily do, and it stings pretty good. As directed it's just nice and &#34;tingly&#34;. Way more concentrated than any other brands I've tried, AND THAT'S A GOOD THING! Does what it says it does too! Very nice product!
B000GD03TO|5|Thus product has helped with my child's dandruff. He uses it once a week and that sufficient.
B000SQTJZ8|5|Let me preface this by saying that I do not believe in using expensive skin care products.  Drug store products are just as good as the vast majority of designer ones, in my opinion.  However, I was able to test this for a few days and was astonished by the results.  I have bad allergies which leave dark circles under my eyes.  I have tried countless products to get rid of them, all with minimal success.  When I began using the Bioelements Vitamineral Power Pen, the circles cleared up almost completely.  I would say that I have maybe 20% of the darkness that I used to have.  Admittedly, that's not perfect, but it's much better than it ever has been before.  Now I can cover them up with foundation and they become invisible.     I still cringe at the thought of paying $40 for a tiny little vial of roll-on vitamins but for the first time, I have found a product that is worth it.
B003ILUQPM|5|I love this plates, they are very beautiful and they work perfectly.  I got them at home on the day that I was nominated, I loved the service, excellent seller.  Recommend this seller  Tk you
B001AO0WCG|4|I purchased this product for my mother because she heard about it by word of mouth.<br />After one treatment, she was sold! The product far exceeded her expectations. She<br />was impressed with the way her looked and felt.<br />She was also impressed by the fact that it was easy to use and didn't require a lot<br />of extra work.<br /><br />Thanks and great job!
B0042L1XJK|1|This product is not authentic. What ever is in the bottle is not Paul Mitchell. Don't fall for this scam. Don't waste your money.
B00766SGE8|5|This is the REAL Barbie Pink Lippy. It's the perfect shade for summer. I do agree with other reviewers that it goes on matte, though personally I prefer it matte but if it's bothersome then just use chapstick or maybelline baby lips in quenched. I guarantee you'll love it! :)
B00006592X|2|I was disappointed with this product.  The rollers that are supposed to decrease pain are useless.  All that attachment seems to do is make the unit less effective.  Using the regular attachment without the rollers works a little better, but still left way too much hair behind.  I have waxed for years so there isn't much pain for me.  On the other hand, that should also make my hair easier to remove and this still didn't do even a halfway decent job.  I have returned it and will try something else.
B002XWZH6A|5|I have fine hair.  It is easily damaged by sun, wind, salt water or pool water.  In only one or 2 shampoos my hair is noticeably shinier and softer. I am so hooked.
B007HOCQVS|5|I have been a Wen user for years, but had never tried this &#34;flavor&#34;.  It is just scrumptious!  Get it!
B00GWF4AS0|4|This feels great on my face and neck. A small amount on a cotton pad goes a long way...the whole job in fact, which is fabulous. Since I've just started using this toner, I can't say more, but I do like it and the lovely fragrance of roses.
B000B65IXC|2|I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend after having fond memories of smelling it years before.<br /><br />I feel like this fragrance is one-dimensional.  once I breath it and try to inhale it through, it's like hitting a wall.<br /><br />This is supposed to smell like lilies, but you can sniff a flower and not feel like your nose is stuffed up.<br /><br />the best way to describe it is that it makes my noise feel stuffed up vs. a real flower is refreshing to smell.<br /><br />I tried the 'citrus sport' version of this and found it 'breathed' much better and was actually refreshing--not so heavy and one-dimensional.
B003UKKHB4|5|Have only been using for a week and I already feel a difference!
B0064F4CXG|5|This product is a bit more expensive than I'd like but I started using it right before my wedding and loved it so I purchased more! It tends to dry out your face a bit so have an extra moisturizer on hand.
B001MP0T2Q|4|Works exactly as expected.  The only slight drawback is that I thought the handle would be longer.  However, the length does not hinder its use.
B001CYERMU|5|Great eyeshadow applicators!
B00DG8EZY0|1|The Nivea lotion has Parabens.
B000C1UDPO|4|All four of them are good, Gold being the best.
B000BUUVTY|1|The product was received on time but the Gillete blades are not real. They are fake. I am not able to use them, they hurt so much. the blades are not sharp and not aligned properly. they don't have the serial number as the real Gillette blades have. I'll never buy anything from this retailer.
B00H9A40R8|3|Doesn't give a close shave, but still nice. I wish it shaved closer!! I gave this to my hubby for a Christmas gift thinking it was time to upgrade his shaver. Although initially the shave is smooth, but the end of the day his face is course like sandpaper. His other razor gave a much closer shave. This would be good for those first starting to shave, not a 31 year old man who needs to shave daily or will grow a beard.
B003KJBK3E|1|Wasn't paying attention when the description said a 3 pack... silly me for judging it by the picture of 6 brushes! Deceptive! I would not have paid 12 dollars for 3 brushes if I would have know!
B00AC2KDXK|5|Love!!!!!
B003B7RT08|5|What a great product this is. I will for sure recommend it to my friends and family! Keep the products coming.
B0087O4XKE|2|I bought this item for nail art. It's very messy and really fine specs of glitter. Looks nice on the nails, but is very messy. I wont use it very often.
B00NPWQUNG|5|I have not used this very much, but recently I found a very good use for it. I used it to clean the glue that is left behind when I take the lables off plastic and glass containers. It works great! I also use it to clean up kitchen  and bathroom counter tops. I have got to find more uses for this.
B00C7WG9MM|5|Great value.  Item was just what I expected.
B00DDVAVN4|5|wonderful!  i am so pleased.  much better than cornstarch or baking soda alone.  scent is very light and pleasing.
B00006IV2L|4|Very durable and simple! I can't believe its so cheap because it works so well!! I am so happy I got it!
B00RWIMD08|5|I've wanted one of these for a long time.  It's such a disappointment to get into a luxurious warm bath and then put one's head on a cold, hard tile.  This transforms the experience.
B000JWQ3N2|5|Seems to moisturize and strengthen hair from the inside out.  Leave in overnight if the scent is not too strong for you (cover pillows to protect from green oil) otherwise, wash out after an hour or so-will render same great results.
B004TI9KHS|5|Great price
B000CCFY8Y|4|The wrinkle revenge cleanser series contain ever increasing amounts of glycolic acid to exfoliate and brighten skin.  It really does the trick! My skin feels great when I use this (along with toner and everything else that should be a part of your skin care regimen). I'd give it five stars, except I don't like the sulfates and phosphates that are included in the ingredient list.  Unfortunately I haven't found a product with this much glycolic acid that doesn't have those pesky chemicals, so I'm sticking with Dermadoctor.
B001ET78BA|5|Awesome conditioner for unruly hair. Curly hair can be kept close by using this conditioner
B00M4PLBDE|5|Works well.
B001ET7KBI|4|Good item
B00GUDR4XC|5|My daughter wanted this for her birthday. I was a bit skeptical about this at first, I was afraid that it would be EVERYWHERE, break into tiny pieces, and either wouldn't work, or worse, wouldn't come out, but I figured it is better than actual dye, and my fears were soon put to rest!. I'm glad that I got it for her! Before, she would always just pull her hair back into a ponytail and be out the door for school (I'm not sure she would even brush it) but since  getting this she actually does her hair everyday now! She has had such a great time creating different colorful designs in her hair, and her brother's and sister's as well. As soon as she opened this, her and her friends were off to the bathroom in a flash, ready to color their hair. You do have to dampen the hair a bit for the chalk to show, you can't do it dry. While it is a bit messy, you are suppose to curl your hair (or use a straightener) and hair spray to set the color - this way the color doesn't rub off on their skin or clothing. If the color does get on something, don't worry, it washes right out! After they are done styling their hair, the chalk comes out with generally only 1 wash! If you have blonde or lighter colored hair, you may have to wash a couple of times. Most of the colors show up pretty vibrant, however, the browns, white, and dark dark colors are kind of dull. The best thing about it is that the chalk itself won't damage their hair, unlike hair dye. We have been very happy with this product and are already looking into buying more.
B001WAKU0W|4|This product is as close to the Redken Straight 05 that I can find.  Since Redken doesn't make the Straight 05 any more and I do not like the Redken 06 replacement at all, I use the Prive`.  It is pretty good, although not quite as good as the Redken 05, but almost!  It is the best that I can find for curly and frizzy hair.  It smooths, relaxes and adds shine, while not feeling heavy or gooey. It has as a light natural feel yet does the job.  Thanks Prive`!
B002TTN7RS|4|This is good palette for the price but if you do not use have an eye primer then dont waste your money. This has to be applied with a good brush and a primer. I like it bc there are alot of color options. Not all of the colors are matte but the shimmer ones are at a minimum and are actually good to add with the matte colors in my opinion. I wouldnt buy another pallette since this one has so many colors, but i will definitely put this one too good use.
B008L0AIUS|5|Wonderful and I have never used wax before
B0080L9FUM|5|The ingredient list in this toothpaste has none of the bad stuff that many of the conventional products have, and it still does a great job.  Don't expect a lot of foam, but the taste is very good and leaves your mouth feeling very clean.<br />The SLS and who knows what other ingredients in other products gave me headaches, but I am having no problems at all with Earthpaste!
B000C2359E|5|I have always heard friends say they love this perfume... and i must admit that i do too!!! i love wearing it to go out and the scent lasts for a few hours. just love it. i would definitely recommend it to my friends
B009AWNR6I|3|it works but i like a little larger than this one,, don't like the texture that much, wish i did
B0067F998G|5|these were perfect for displaying the hats I make.  I love that when I am teaching a class they fold down flat for transport and then go together fast.
B00H0MFCT0|5|My favorite smelling perfume mist! Yummy
B0009XH6TG|5|Dries your hair a lot quicker, hair is super smooth and less frizzy!  Love it!!!!
B00DHX4PN0|5|I love this collar it is well made,it feels good on the neck.It would make any outfit pop.cant wait to ware it out.I would buy it again.
B004N095YK|5|Good product
B00DZ3YTGK|5|Exactly what I needed!! Great product! I used it to make homade sunscreen. Powder is very fine, blends well with no lumps.
B00KJL4G1E|5|It works for my pool and I'm happy with the price!
B001DKGK0A|5|This toner turns your hair a wonderful shade of purple and then fades with everyday washing to a perfect platinum. If you mix it with conditioner you can sometimes avoid the purple tint but I personally love the effect.
B0048IFLBI|5|great cruelty free product. this company never disappoints. leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh. Smells great too!
B000VKBJPE|5|If you are in the need for some tight curls, don't mind sitting under the dryer for a little while and looking for they style to last you, this is the product for you. I suggest using a good setting lotion (lottabody). After the curls loosen a little you can put some mouse and the style can last even longer. A good look and a lasting hair style for those looking for low maintenance and something that will last, even in humid environments. I like them because they don't pull the hair too tight and come off of the hair very nicely. You can make the curl tight or loose ringlets. Either way the curls will last for a while.
B000TX5UCG|3|I would like to have been able to give more stars, but.....what they say about a not long enough tip to keep from burning your fingers is spot on. OUCH! I'm being a slow learner after going from an expensive curling iron that I finally had to retire. It had a long tip and the cord actually did not tangle (it does on this one).<br /><br />If this had a Med. heat setting, that would make me happy. I go from burning my fine hair to not curling it at all between the high and low setting.<br /><br />Couldn't beat the price, but it sure could use some improvements.
B00BI9QTDE|1|Beautiful colors but not too sure about the water base because by the time the makeup is put into the airbrush, it is a clogging nightmare. Never make it onto the face and we spent over an hour trying to get the airbrush un-clogger and cleaned up. Not at all happy with this product.
B001CJE0MW|5|This product definitely a balm in that it glides on very easily and is absorbed quickly. I much prefer this kind of preparation to a cream. I find it very moisturizing and will order for the third time. The container lasts a long time.
B00DPE9EQO|5|OZ Naturals is an amazing product. I see a noticeable difference in my skin and feel it protects my skin well from the sun. I have used products that were not as effective and cost much more.
B00IALDHDI|3|I received Bombshell mascara from influenster surfs up vox box! I have used it a few times and am pretty happy with it. It I'd a little hard to take off though and at first can be kinda sticky till it dries. Overall like the look and enjoy using it
B008U8N26I|5|Amazing results!  I have not had eyebrows since the 80s!  I feel like they are darker than I remember, but it has been so long since I had them. This stuff definitely works as advertised and is easy to use.
B00FFKP5YG|5|Quick delivery great produxt
B0060P0DVK|4|foot switch was junk. other than that nice product. would reccomend. good price. i would purchase agian in the future
B002AT0K1I|4|Not Trufitt and Hill but a strong lather and I find the scent mellow and pleasing .  And I like the whole Eton College image as well as the price.
B0009R16O8|5|Great soap. My wife and I share the large bottle and it works well and smells nice. You can use it when camping and you need to take a quick swim to wash off. No chemicals and a little goes a long way. buy it!
B00P3D8E84|5|This Argan oil is one of the best I have used.  It is lightweight, and has your hair feeling very moist and not weighed down.  I wish it came in a huge jar.
B0036JLJ2K|5|I have been using this for a couple of weeks and have noticed an improvement in my skin. After 2 weeks of wearing the serum every night, the fine lines around my eyes disappeared. The serum is very light, smooth and non sticky.I love how this product brightened my skin and made it look more youthful.
B00367BQUM|2|It wasn't what I expected. The aroma was a bit too loud. It clashed with my perfume.I'm looking forward to trying some of your other products.
B001QD75YE|5|Great, i love this!
B000C21762|5|This perfume is discontinued but is the freshest scent I have found in 20 years.  On me, it smells very light and it is noticed as a faint good smell by others.  I guess you can over do the application, but only a little is needed.  My teenage niece and much older women have asked about it and complimented me.
B001EMHJ2K|5|I've been wanting dredlocks for quite a while. I've been looking on a site and was thinking about buy some. The thought of making them myself hadn't crossed my mind because I'm all for helping someone make a profit, seeing how the economy is now adays. This girl was selling dreadlocks saying about $200.00 would cover my full head. So I looked up this. I'm making my own now. Because asking $200.00 for somthing you paid probably $20.00 to make isn't a profit anymore, its selfish. So thank you amazon, and whoever has theese for sale. I will be buying them friday!
B005FPDCOG|5|I'm glad I bought the wider 2 inch iron. I have long wavy hair and this makes it much easier to get it straight. Great product!
B003FZ6Y84|1|These do not work well. They simply cause hairs to break and do not grip well at all. Not recommended!
B000VV0APS|5|I love Burt's Bees! This Coconut Foot Creme is beyond Amazing! The heavenly scent will leave your feet smelling so good, and feeling so so so soft! I highly recommend! Burt's Bees will forever be one of my favorite brands! R.I.P Burt thank you for the high quality amazing products you have made! The world is truly a better place because of your exsistance, you will be greatly missed!<br />I received this Burt's Bees Coconut Foot Creme at a discounted price for my honest, unbiased review, and opinion, and it was an Honor to do so! Thank you!
B000C1VSUS|2|Smell is different from when I used it few years ago.  Feels like it's either a different formula or old one.  It just is not pleasant smell anymore.  Feel just too strong yet unpleasant.
B001FWXIOW|4|quite a sensual fragrancel
B000GRXDYM|5|I'll buy these again when the time comes. Works as advertised.
B005GLKRJM|5|I have extremely sensative, dry, reactive skin.  Tried this product for 2 weeks with extrodinary results,  no breakout, no redness and my skin is soft with a noticable reduction in the fine lines.  I have ordered 2 more bottles.  Do not want to be without it.
B004NPQQLU|5|This is a good hairdryer, bought like two years ago and it is still going strong!
B000J45DTU|5|I read the opinions on this product and figured if the product was half as good as other reviewers claimed, it would be worth a try.       Before the Denco easy Grip Foot Smoother, I needed a pedicure once a month to shave off the callous on the soles and heels of my feet.  The cracks in the callous split to the live flesh below and caused pain and bleeding.  After a month of use, the splits are substantially reduced and feet are much more comfortable.      So much for the testimonial, now a description of the product.    There are two sides to this.  One medium and the other course.  The medium side is recessed in the holder and the opposite course side is more fully exposed to allow some serious removal of callous material.  The holes are punched so as to allow removal of dead skin from the surface.  The holes also function on the course side as an added scraping surface, as there is a very slight edge on the holes facing the course side.      The handle is ergonomically shaped and bends slightly toward the course side to allow excellent grip and more pressure during use on the course side of the foot smoother.      The cost of the unit is about the price of a foot massage in my region of the country and while I will continue to have pedicures, my feet are in much better shape due to the use of this item.    BTW, I have also used a variety of other methods including foot razors, graters, stones, etc.  None work as well as the Denco.
B00JSYXTFM|4|Love it..
B007ISRNCA|1|The curler did not come in the original packaging and was not functional. It was not authentic and when I contacted the company they were very unprofessional and refused to give me a full refund.<br />Simply said: DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! I would have much rather spent the extra 5 bucks for an authentic product.
B004RRGOIE|3|The construction is good and the material is sturdy enough to protect the content.<br /><br />However, the inner division is just a fabric section, without closure.
B00A0J0A8I|5|That's probably one of the best post-shave balms I've ever used. It doesn't burn your skin, has a nice barely noticeable smell to it and really softens your skin. It also lasts a long time as it takes only a dime size or so per application. Highly recommend
B002YR2D5W|4|Does fill in pores nicely, provides a matte &#34;halo&#34; look to the face. I use a brush to apply, the powder is very fine and tends to fly everywhere. Best to use with a stubby bristle kabuki style brush, than with a whispy bristle powder brush.
B00461F4PA|4|definitely works!!!!! my feet are not as rough as they were after having kids.  great product.  Just be careful to not walk around, you'll fall
B003CYKDDA|5|Love this
B00B4XCOSS|1|It worked well on my hands and legs but I got a red patch when I used it on my chin area.<br />Disappointed :/
B006KBFXSC|5|I been using Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer for a few years now, and for this fall I decided to expand my collection with it in Plum. Just like all the other shades, it applies evenly and feels great on my lips (pepper-minty). And the plum shade itself is amazing, matches online image. And you can apply a second layer to make the plum color even darker. Love it!
B000C1VT70|3|It didnt smell like the original one I had for some reason....and the scent doesn't last on the skin, like the original one does.
B00014FKZK|5|A good way to wake up the senses !
B003607ZNG|3|Not much scrubbing action. Try Jack Black Face Scrub.
B0015NZ6FK|3|I can see why they show this product on a woman's face.  It just barely fits over my head.  I wear a 7 3/8&#34; hat and this mask is adjusted out to the max.  It is very comfortable, but it doesn't work well on a big guys head.  I would give it five stars if I were a woman and had a smaller head, because it is excellent is all other respects.
B00Q3P9552|5|Very happy good service
B000GLRREU|1|Strong water pressure, plenty of water volume. Takes up less space. Seems well made. This replaced an older one and the new one is better (much to my surprise).  Update: I was wrong. The new one was NOT better, just a bit stronger flow. Broke down a short while later. Changed my rating. Sick of water piks, tried something called H20 Floss. (You can find it on Amazon, but the hyper-link isn't working so I didn't add it.) It isn't perfect, the on-off button and the intensity buttons are reverse of what they are on water pik and this isn't as effective, but the flow is better, stays strong, and it seems to be doing fine for a long time. Don't like water piks anymore, won't buy them unless they improve the quality.
B00J88FEUQ|5|I got this based on the recommendation of 52weeksofbeauty on You Tube. Works! I have Vomor extensions and the salon had ALSO glued, not just taped, the extensions in... and still got them out! Although I think it will be less work next time since I reinstalled myself without added glue.
B001H4I7ZS|5|I find Sarah Michael's Gardenia oil the most authentic smelling oil I have tried. It does not change fragrance when worn or get rancid.I have received many compliments when wearing this.
B002IVGAMG|2|The comb is very sturdy and works well with thick hair. However, there were not 12 like the item description says, there was only one comb.
B00S032W3M|5|This is a very full brush capable of creating a great lather. For the price, this can't be beat.
B000VV07L0|1|I cannot attest to how well this works in keeping bugs at bay, because the moment I applied it (thankfully to myself and not my children) I began to gag. It smells like rancid vomit (and being a nurse and a mother of two children I am well versed in the smell of vomit) and I immediately ran into my sister's house to try to wash it off. I tried soap, I tried hand sanitizer, I tried scrubbing with a wash cloth and soap, NOTHING helped. We ended up leaving the BBQ because I couldn't stand the smell and needed to shower immediately.
B0067F28ZW|5|Very nice gift for a teen (it's soft, it's cute). She loves this set!
B003YJ8ZX8|5|Ordered this for a Christmas present for my son.  Item arrived quickly and exactly as described.  As far as I know, my son is pleased with it since he had requested it for a present and hasn't mentioned otherwise.
B00DYQE33C|2|It smells like old lady flower perfume
B002GZYEMM|1|Does not last.
B004QLOFT6|5|after having this product this is a must have! i love how my makeup last all day long! without oil breaking through!
B00005A43X|1|This product should not be in the market. The first one I bought was broken into pieces.I sent it back and was replaced but same thing happen again broke into pieces<br />when I tried to switch the other attachment. Send it back to China cheaply made.
B0000YUXI0|5|My two-year old sucked her thumb consistently while sleeping and it was causing her teeth to move.  In fact, her bite was affected dramatically.  I tried some of the other \\"thumb sucking\\" products on the market that you can purchase at the drugstore and they all failed.  She didn't seem to be affected in the least.  I also tried the old methods of lemon juice, etc....yeah, right!  When I first tried Mavala Stop on her (I painted the entire thumb nail), I realized that when she would pick up her food with her fingers (as toddler's usually eat---picking up a green bean, whatever..) she would get the bad taste in her mouth and stop eating.  To alleviate this problem, I began to paint only a small part of her nail, right over the cuticle and onto the finger itself.  A tiny tiny bit!  This worked because when she would use her fingers to eat, she would not put that much of her thumb in her mouth to taste the cuticle area.  However, when thumb sucking, that part of the thumb does enter the mouth.  The only thing is that with lots of hand-washing, you may need to apply it more often (maybe each night) because it washes off more easily.  Also, if you have painted the entire nail and you wish to remove it, acetone will remove Mavala Stop--you just might have to work at it with several cotton balls and then wash hands VERY WELL to remove the acetone taste.  My daughter stopped sucking her thumb immediately.  I kept up the Mavala for about a month just to prevent her from picking up the habit again.  A last note, her teeth moved back into correct position in about 6 weeks and her bite is perfect.  I highly recommend this product.
B003NRYG4S|4|Serves the purpose for travel. At first I was not sure of the brightness, but makeup appears to be on my face in the right place.  Compact.
B004ZHTM2G|5|Nice variety. quick delivery.
B0011Z3WXU|4|Works for me...
B001ECQ54S|5|I love things that smell like mint. It is like aromatherapy, especially in the morning when you need a wake-up.<br />I even e-mailed Axe and asked them to start selling it again. When this runs out, I'll have to use the Axe Apollo.<br />It also has a refreshing scent, but not as good as the Sharp Focus.
B00BXJVV6E|4|Comes with a little drawstring bag that protects it and stores all the parts.  Works great (AFTER I had to ask my husband why the battery wasn't working - guess I'm an idiot because it didn't work for me when I tried it!).  Even better than the micro-touch I'd been borrowing from my DH.
B00K7PO996|5|This cream is amazing. Look at the ingredients!! wow!! I used this as an all over face moisturizer (it says on the bottle can be used all over) and it is better for a moisturizer with very high end ingredients/antioxidants but my eyes needed a different anti puffy product to make my eyes feel better in the mornings. Either way, this cream is most certainly a must have for every ones facial skin!
B0056YGW2A|5|they work good and make it feel like your eyelids are floating if your into that type of thing ..
B0090QJ8HQ|5|Fast delivery, Cheap and good products.
B001Q257M2|1|GRUND IS EXCELLENT.  I received a product named  ProDesign Sessions.  It is not the same!!  Further, the spray did not work and I had to pour the contents into another container.  I have ordered from Amazon for many years and  this has never happened before.  I would not order this product again from Amazon.
B000PNXBVW|3|I tried this twice now. I can't see any difference yet. I have a lot of brown spots on the cheeks. I think I left it on too long before I rinsed it off. I thought I rinsed off very well and put on a good amount of lotion after. I felt stinging during the night. The next morning, the skin around the cheek bone was red and looked like I got scraped. I still like to keep trying this product. Maybe I will use a timer.
B005E98NCE|5|Love this mask - makes my skin look and feel great. I would highly recommend this mask and the whole line.
B005OW7Q0Q|1|NO USE. I don't understand what it is supposed to do to the hair. It does nothing. I expected the hair to soften and free the frizz, but it does NOTHING. If you still want to buy it, good luck.
B002DOO1VA|3|Are these Mac brushes? No. But for the deal I got these are good enough. Can you tell what brush is what? Not without feeling them. It would be nice if they were numbered or named. Also they shed like crazy
B000JWQ4E0|5|I was having trouble with  acne on my face and tried  numberious products but this Neem soap did the job.  It also help fade dark spots. Thanks.
B005KJ3508|1|Horrible!  I received this product yesterday.  It is old and expired.  The packaging is outdated from 2011. Three years ago!! The product was delivered after the date it should have arrived. I am soooooo disappointed!
B005OJ55T8|5|This product acts like a tinted moisturizer.  Great for summertime when you want something light.  Blends to your skin tone, which I find amazing.  I have an olive complexion and my skin tans in the summer easily, this will change along with my skin.  I love to mix this with [[ASIN:B004NA31MM Origins Halo Effect Instant Illuminator, Golden Potion, .17 fl oz]], then apply it to my face.  Gives me a nice glow for summer, and a pick me up in winter.
B002UYBDD2|5|More than natural, I love the organic certified ingredients. The texture is very soft and provides the right amount coverage on the eyebrow without looking overly dark. Very natural looking. No weird smells or shimmer. I will buy this and other products from 100% Pure again.
B0083FNJH0|1|I did not care for this product.  Did not produce the advertised results.
B0076XEQJ0|5|It was a Christmas gift for someone that I ordered late (but it still made it on time) and they love it!
B00D879BFW|4|Does wonders for my nose. Great product
B003AYTXGA|5|My daughter has the thickest hair in my family.  Instead of buying the cheaper dryer's for $20 or less it is worth the little extra to buy a good hair dryer. It takes her less than 5 min to dryer her with this dyer. And one swipe with the straightener. I have very fine and thin hair no kidding about 45 seconds my hair is completely dry. I bought this for one of my daughter's friends for Christmas. My daughter has had hers baby bliss for over 2 years no problems. We switched because the chi iron was burning and breaking her hair an mine as well . We  Love this product would not use anything else. Great buy it is a must have !!!!
B002ZNJI80|5|Good facial quality and very nice hair
B001G7PM4U|5|I know it says it is for men - but I use it all the time.  My hair feels so nice with it that I don't care that it says it is for men.  The scent is very mild and pleasant, and it doesn't take very much (about the size of a nickle does my shoulder-length hair.
B000J5UERU|5|It makes my wig so soft and easy to work with. I hope you keep making it available because I will need some more soon
B004GE4I9A|4|This is a great product for quick hydration of the skin after a shower or just in passing. But if you have very dry skin, you should probably look for an Aveeno product to soothe the dryness. This is more for temporary moisturizing, but it feels really nice on the skin and it smells great (in a very slight perfume kind of way, not in a fruity kind of way).
B009SDJQCI|5|best nail polish remover ever!! glad I bought this brand good value price for the size
B003V3AZJY|3|it's working only on 110 Volt.
B0116EYR2A|5|Bought it for my sister and she was very happy with it. Thank you for the great product and service
B006RFZ9IK|4|I have been using Olay cloths for many years and been very satisfied. These are very similar. They seem to lather about the same and feel the same (neither more or less coarse). I do not notice any remarkable scent-which for me is good. I have not experienced any change in the condition of my facial skin from using these cloths. I think they are a fine option for most people who use these types of cloths. I use the Olay version that is for \\"older\\" skin so I will stick with them because they have worked well for me and I think that they anti-aging properties have been beneficial over the years of using them.
B00CW51OG0|5|Budget device and it works great.
B002HTI2TI|5|Closes nicks on contact without the harshness or sting of regular styptic pencils. Disappears but still works when lotion is applied over it.
B004OOBSA4|2|i have been using this cream for a while now but it does not work, you can give it a shot if you want
B005B0ZCTI|2|Yo use esta peineta cuando ten&iacute;a 15 a&ntilde;os pero era suave esta es dura y hace doler al agarrar el cabello :-( no Good
B001ET76EY|4|iv used this product before, i have always had very problematic skin and when i began using the product everything has cleared up. i tried nuetrogena, im highly allergic to garnier products and i just tried the olay swirly blue one that was advertised on tv. well im back to this-cetaphil. it quickly dries out the pimples i do get and i read a review on here she also uses the ddf (great stuff i found at tjmax) but some people say they feel their face is still dirty and then another review said this stuff contains chemicals used to clean car engines. so i guess what im trying to say is if it contains ingrediants to clean car engines i guess getting a little oil and dirt off your face is no problem for cetaphil.
B00MOL4AIQ|5|This was a Valentine's Day gift for a dear Lady friend and She really enjoyed them!  Thank You!!
B000X2UCJO|5|For $19.99 this is one of the best buys out there.  Wall mounted the cord and dryer are out of the way and off the counter.  Only 1600 watts but dries better then our bigger old one.  Small, compact and you can take it with you when traveling.
B0023UTL7S|1|It dried my hair and did not helped to grow.
B007W90ZI4|1|Bought this through a Living Social deal.  First of all, they have some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced.  They never sent any shipping info.  You can't even contact them directly.  You had to give them your e-mail and phone number and hope they will contact you (they won't, even if you 5 times over 6 weeks).  When this thing finally showed up it was great... for a few weeks.  Then it stopped taking a charge, making it a very expensive still brush.  I tried to contact the company many times and only after publicly decrying them in the internet's version of a town square did they get back in touch with me.  Did they offer to replace of fix or anything?  Nope.  They just sent a tiny sample tube of teeth whitener (that nobody asked for and I certainly didn't want).  Bottom line:  Save your money, go to the grocery store and buy one of those under $10 electric brushes.  It'll last 10 times longer than this overpriced piece of garbage.
B006QB4BSE|5|i have used this in my hair on my dogs hair, on my skin and feet also.  it feels great and smells wonderful
B0035LCZOK|5|😃
B002K4KLMQ|5|Fantastic!
B003654SVS|1|This is hands-down one of the most atrocious perfumes I have ever had the displeasure to smell. Regardless of how I feel about Kim Kardashian, this stuff just smells god-awful. For the record, I am not a Kim K. hater and I'm not out to get her or whatever. I just think that her perfume smells really, really bad. I don't really know what hand she personally had in making this, but whoever did make it obviously tried to make something that smells \\"high end\\" and it just fails miserably. Many of the notes in this particular fragrance are ones that I like (especially sandalwood, jasmine and the ambiguous \\"crisp\\" top notes) but somehow the balance is just totally off. This perfume manages to smell nasty and cheap at the same time, which I would assume is the exact opposite of it's intent. I'm not a big fan of celeb-created scents, but this one really takes the cake as far as it's awfulness goes. I see that this has been popular enough to earn a flanker, but I will get poked in the eye with a rusty butter knife before I smell that. There are plenty of better options for a warm, sultry, sensual scent, so try those instead. You might pay a little more, but at least you won't smell gross.
B000Q6SU3C|5|I purchased the shaver for my friend, he really likes the shaver although I must admit, the first one stopped working after only 4 weeks.  Amazon was really great about sending a replacement pretty quickly.
B006RJRFBK|5|All I can say is WOW. I always thought the Physician's Formula would be garbage because of it's cheap looking packaging. Boy am I kicking myself now. These are the most creamy, pigmented, long lasting, smudge proof eyeliners I have ever owned! My Mac and Urban Decay pencils don't hold a candle to these. I can put them on the back of my hand and wipe them a few seconds later, and they stay put! I am super impressed. Wore these for 12-hours and they looked THE SAME as when I put them on. Didn't even use a primer. There's a little sharpener on the bottom of the pencils that you would never know was there unless you read the packaging. Will be buying more colors in this line and repurchasing these.
B000JNQSIQ|3|it's not that precise for fine trimming of beard. It's not stainless and if moist, blades catch rust.<br /><br />Would had been better if had two separate combs for creating guiding line near right and left ears.
B008SOJRI6|5|Just the right size.
B0080AC73U|5|Been wanting to try a primer and setter, so glad I did. keeps makeup in place in over 100 degrees weather
B002RCBHYM|5|like
B007ROD0ZE|5|Great
B0070P65RU|5|Just as described
B000PKFHDU|5|just as I expected ! Thank you.
B005JFUWCC|5|Redkens good yards yadda
B001440150|5|oooooh such a sweet morning shower every day
B001DYM62C|5|I bought one for a trim and my mom and her friend wanted one so I purchased 2 more.  The price is good and so is the quality.
B005XUNG5I|5|I can't believe how this has conquered my dry, hard, nasty heels. It's easy to use, easy to clean and meets all my expectations.
B004P2LL2K|5|Amazing product
B007M81B4W|4|It helped somewhat!
B005V247N8|5|I like it very excellent soft and high quality .... I advise you to buy it is wonderful i like it
B0007RAYWA|4|I like this product. It's gentle on my skin and has a fresh, clean scent.
B002RBF1PO|5|A solidly built and beautifully finished piece. I've used it for a few days but given that it's all metal, I can't imagine it breaking or wearing down over any number of years.
B00G5L867C|5|Kids love these - especially when used in conjunction with Brush Busters, the Sonicare app.  Excellent product. At this price, wish I bought one of these as they are no less functional than the adult version (just fewer bells & whistles which to be honest, most of which I never have used)...great brush for kids or adults I think!
B00I1ISDZM|5|I've suffered from years of acne and I struggle to maintain a half-decent complexion. My friend recommended a particular peel-off mask to me, but it was way too expensive. I tend to look for products at a great price, so I decided I would see what Amazon had to offer in terms of facial masks. This one seemed to stand out. Everywhere I looked, I saw outstanding reviews, and I saw claims that it helped with acne and facial imperfections. I decided I wanted to try it out, and I couldn't be more grateful. I opened up the mud mask and was pleasantly surprised by the smell. It kind of reminded me of lemons. I applied the mask and it dried pretty quickly. I could feel a little bit of tingling, which reassured me that it was working its magic. The mask wasn't too tight on my face, which made for a pretty comfortable experience. After 10 minutes, I washed it off with warm water and patted my face dry. The mud mask came off easily, and the result was great! My skin felt incredibly supple and soft, and the size of my pores has visibly been reduced. I'm excited to continue using this product, and I would recommend this to anyone thinking of buy a facial mask.
B00Q37XTK2|1|Afgter usiung the product for over a month I did not notice any difference in wrinkles or age spots.  I will ot reorder.
B000TAE0RK|5|I immediately loved the natural smell when I opened the box. I used it right away and it lathers up VERY quickly.  My skin felt, moisturized, soft and clean. Immediately put on your moisturizer for the best effect. I also used it on my face which had a fresh look to it after washing. Great value, will definitely purchase again.
B0096OEHLE|2|While I originally liked this model because it runs at the same power whether the light is on or not (some other models don't use 'fullpower' unless the light is on which drains the battery faster.)<br /><br />However, after not that much use, the green 'cover' at the end became loose and does would not snap back in properly.  Now it will work for a few seconds before  it becomes loose again.<br /><br />Basically this no longer works and I will need to find a replacement...  All of these trimmers are cheap, but I usually get at least 6 months of use before it needs to be changed out, but this lasted maybe 2-3 months at most.
B00C2ECIIY|4|Good product and fast delivery
B008V9BBJG|5|Used this for years.  Light and non greasy and has a pleasant smell.  Its a little expensive, but a little goes a long way and wearing sunscreen everyday is cheaper than dealing with skin problems later in life.
B000KRTCCU|5|great self care tools. the index knobber is great for trigger points. i wish i could buy these for all of my fellow massage therapists :)
B007TA5V76|2|disappointed in fragrance- vanilla was my favorite but not available
B00CN4GQT0|5|My granddaughter had asked for these for Christmas.  When she opened the package, she was thrilled.  She loves the huge variety of brushes.
B003MPJWY0|5|This is one of my favorite colors of Chanel.  So happy I found it.  Thanks for posting this on line.
B000C219QA|5|I am always hesitant when ordering cologne online because from what I read even on Amazon it can be a mixed bag.  I actually received a sample of this fragrance in the mail and I immediately loved the smell and came straight to Amazon to buy.  I received exactly what they sell at Macy's or Dillard's for a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />This is a great summer cologne and the bottle should last for quite awhile.  My purchase was through Amazon and the cologne came in the blue box still in the plastic and I can say without a doubt this is the real thing.
B006DR2BQU|5|Great
B001AFGLI4|5|The adjustable heat actually works!! And that's a hard thing to say about many hair dryers - it's the perfect compliment to all bathroom accessories.
B008J10ESU|4|This is a very cute head band, but it doesn't stay on my head very well. (This is a common problem for me though!)
B000PKMA2G|5|My husband loved this.  Great Shaver....great cleaning system.  Performs as advertised.  However, he will keep his old Norelco for traveling.  New one would be bulky to travel with if he took the cleaning system with it.
B00CK9227S|5|Item was delievered on time and as advertised.  I am happy with my purchase.
B00D2KW68Y|4|I really like this product. It's effective at preventing odors and doesn't irritate my skin. I also really like that the product doesn't leave any residue which I noticed with conventional deodorants. Also it lasts a long time, bought a jar in Dec. and now its nearly March and I still have 3/4 of the jar.
B00AE07CRA|3|I was not impressed with this product. I think it kind of stinks.  I know all Axe products contain scent, but most are less overwhelming than this item.  The smell is to potent to be pleasing.  Other Axe hair products have a more pleasant level of smell, in my opinion.<br /><br />The texture is kind of slimy and the results do not appear to be clean hair.<br /><br />I did give it three stars because the smell does, fortunately, reduce as it dries.  And I realize that the resulting look may suit some styles.  To each his own.  However, I remain unimpressed.
B00065IBKK|5|Very happy works good very smooth cuts hair good
B0046HHGNC|5|great brush i actually bought it for my border collie after he runs he loves it cleans his fur without being to corse but also not to soft where it won't penetrate the coat love it,
B000142P12|5|I like it.  Feel like it is adding protein in a gentle way but that's not a scientific observation on my part.  I used to use Giovanni Vita-Pro fusion but I imagined it was making my hair softer.  I have fine 4c hair and a lot of it.  It was getting limp so I tried Apogee 2 Step with great results and wanted to see if using this in between could help.  It adds much needed H20 and has vegetable, silk and keratin proteins.  I've been on the hunt for silk protein.  There scent is not strong my opinion.  It's a fruity tropical scent but doesn't last and/or I'm using other products with a stronger scent.
B000RJPCE8|5|These really work if you have corns . Nothing works as well, not even going to the podiatrist.<br /><br />I found these at a drug store last summer as a last resort, could not walk without pain, bought these and I was walking again.<br />After they wore out about three weeks later I went back to look for more, should have bought them all as there were none to be found, anywhere!..I did a search and found these on Good ole  Amazon and now I have all I need and want.<br /><br />They help so much that there are times I can go without them for awhile as they help heal by keeping the friction off the sore area.
B0042G1IJK|1|Don't be fooled by the pretty colors. They go on waaay too obnoxiously and bright. Great for a little girl just to play with, but not for everyday use.
B004NZ8JLA|5|nice file
B003ZPCMAI|5|every woman must have one of these if you like perfume. i would definetly order again and again!!
B0045PCAI6|5|Good stuff.
B0029MMD3Y|1|Man I love organic products. This does not moisturize my thick, heavier red hair. It feels like it just glosses the surface and leaves a little bit of a greasy residue on my scalp, while leaving my hair dry. I love the smell and cucumbers. The lid is a serious defect, too.<br /><br />I've used many fine hair products. This one felt fine the first few times, but something wasn't right and my hair got cranky.<br /><br />They should try again with a new, deeper conditioner and new packaging.
B00J21EFHM|5|Great price, great product, fast shipping! Love these.
B008R1Q6CA|5|These work great for demoing Mascara. Good value for the money. No too cheaply. No problems with bending etc. when applying product.
B001OI0YQ2|5|this contains a carrying pouch, a &#34;soap dish&#34;, and 4 mini bars of soap.  I recently went on a short trip and took this with.  Based on other reviews I took 2 bars of soap for a 3 night stay.  For just using this for hair on my long (6&#34;past shoulders) hair I still have some left from the first bar and never broke into the second.  The pouch was just convenient.  Period.  And the soap dish, which I thought was kinda dumb, was really awesome.  It helped the soap not get all melty on one side and/or dry up and stick to the side of the tube.  In the future I will probably just use a regular bar and slice it into smaller pieces to save $$ but the pouch and soap dish were worth this purchase.
B000F35R00|5|I've had many clippers over the years, but none as good as these.  They cut cleanly and easily.  I just have to find a place to hide them so my kids don't walk away with them.
B004AI97MA|5|good。
B00C32Z3GO|5|Fast Shipping Exellent seller Strongly recommend it thank you .👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
B00JVAO5LA|4|I have been using these for a half a month, they smell terrible! I'll update my post if I see a huge difference in my hair skin or nails.
B000UQ3WNQ|2|After reading reviews on this item in several makeup articles I was under the impression this mascara made lashes really noticable without clumping.  That was the main point on why this item was so wonderful.  Well I just have no idea how to apply this without it clumping.  I'll try whatever ways I can think of, but at this point I'm really not optimistic at all.....
B005IHEB3M|5|Thank you.
B00KOW827M|5|for how cheap they work AMAZING. great product and I love them. I usually don't like cheap brushes because most of them they break easy or don't work well but these work amazing.
B000ODKGY8|3|It made my skin feel tingly which I thought might be a good thing but I've been using it for two weeks so far and don't really see any results.  MY WARNING:  if you bruise easily like I do, this will not be a good item for you.  I have bruises all over my thighs.  :(
B00BFZFVW6|5|Love using this in roller bottles for all my CPTG essential oils! Definitely recommend this FCO to others.
B000FZXGCE|5|It adds a mild hold that makes your hair look natural
B000P20U80|5|I've long liked this cologne. I ran out, so I needed some more, hence my order to get some more of it.
B001QX4GDC|5|Didn't realize how badly I needed new brushes. These worked out great.
B008QDXSO8|5|What an awesome addition to my skin vac products !!......I love that they are so precise at getting in the tiny areas around the nose.....I can't say enough about how wonderful this whole skin-vac system is, I'm 52 and I've always taken, what I thought was good care of my skin, until I discovered this system, this has taken my home skincare regimen to whole other level...I wish this was around years ago.... believe me, I'm not that easy to please, I'm really picky, especially when it comes to putting anything on my face..... I love the skin-vac products, they are just so easy to use.......:)
B001BTNIZS|5|I love this stuff, but the manufacturer has stopped making it, and the price that distributors are charging has become prohibitive.  It is a shame that its acquisition has become an opportunity of greed for sellers of the product that remains on the market.
B001E5E23G|5|I'm seriously sad that Gillette opted to discontinue this shave cream. It is by far the best shave cream I've ever used, and I was happy to be able to still find some on Amazon.com.
B0039OLUDU|4|Was on vacation with my boyfriend and they had the Westin products in the bathroom!  Absolutely loved the fresh scent that when we came home I went online and ordered it for myself.  It's a little pricey which is why I gave it only 4 stars .
B001Q537NU|1|Doesn't stay on, but fast shipping.
B001ECHLBY|5|I have seen significant results.  You can feel the product working its magic.
B001ET6YPG|4|This product actually does what it says. Leaves it soft, no frizz, and it smells good. They no longer sells in stores so I was really pleased that amazon had it  and got my shipment in a shorter time.
B00DI7HW2Q|3|I'll give you one tip though-- one &#34;tub&#34; works fine for two eyes and that makes the product (which isn't exactly cheap) last much longer!
B004S6YGBG|5|I just love this product and was so hard to find lately. I was so happy to find it on Amazon.com and the small size is great for travelling.  Thanks!
B004U2JVYA|4|Works better than I thought.
B004NMA8PS|5|I purchased this for my daughter when she was in visiting and had forgotten hers.  She absolutely loved it and said it was the best straightener she has ever owned. Left her hair very soft.
B008K2EG50|5|I purchased the Sigmax Essencial Kit about a month ago and I am absolutely in love with them.<br /><br />The brushes are super soft, great quality and the application: flawless!<br /><br />The F80 is THE perfect brush for foundation application. The P86 is perfect for concealer application. I use this set on a daily basis and highly recommend these brushes for everyday use. If you're looking for a great set of brushes, look no further!
B00GLS58OS|5|Gorgeous.  Made my hair shiny and soft.
B000A2LRBY|5|I have used this as a dryer and styler when my hair was very short, now that I am growing it out, its easier to blow dry my hair with my regular dryer till hair is damp. Then style it. I do have to say you must hold it im place a few seconds for curl or wave.  It is used a little different than a curling iron, you hold it against the roots and turn the styler to wind hair then hold for a few seconds. I think it is alot easier than a curling iron, plus you dont burn yourself.
B00E8JQLWK|5|best product i ever use for my skin,help for dry ,itchy skin.I recomend that to any one with  same problem.
B00S9V6GJQ|5|This serum is amazing and this presentation is great for travel or for your purse.<br />Truly knows what your skin needs.
B001CT08KU|4|A little stronger than I remembered from 30 years ago.  Also the plastic bird was chipped on the wings and various other places.
B001MP2O2Y|5|Fits and works great.  Not much else to say :)
B00144QW5I|2|It may be a wonderful product; however, if you do not use it on a daily basis, the product is difficult to be expelled from the container.  My paste has &#34;dried up.&#34; I will never buy this again.
B003BQ6QXK|5|Easy to mount with the silicone provided.  Hot water keeps it form fogging
B007HSOLR6|5|I love almost all of the Chanel Line, so how could you go wrong with this one.  This scent is very nice.
B000L1Z9GS|4|I cannot quite place my finger on what this reminds me of and it's incredibly frustrating actually! This is a very mature scent and is really clean. It's definitely a summer or spring scent and has a very refined scent.
B0006PIRRW|5|This is the best hair oil I've ever used.  As an African American woman who has worn her hair natural for 15+ years, this oil is the best oil blend I've ever used! EVER.  Definitely worth the $$$.  I've seen more products from this vendor and I look forward to buying more products from them. The vendor is professional and on time.
B0083EP6OU|5|Very cool
B00283O7LK|5|I've been using this file for a very short time, but already love it. The file seems like it would be fragile, since its glass/crystal, but after getting use to the weight of it I think it is very durable. As it is glass/crystal I wouldn't bear down on the nail using it - but you shouldn't do that when your filing anyway. The grit is gentle and works very well on my natural nail. I didn't need to keep filing the same spot over and over again to get the shape I wanted to. I am hoping that with long term use I can prevent splits and breakage (as the description claims) of my nails. I would recommend this product, the price is decent and it works.
B00BWKT91S|4|Works on dark circles does not get rid of them but definately helps
B000VON94O|5|The perfume has a fruity scent that takes you on a journey to a beautiful spring day.  It's a perfect scent for spring and summer.  It is one of my favorite scents, so I like it no matter the season.  I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.  It goes perfect with apple scented hand lotion.  It was delivered promptly and in good order.  My husband ordered it for me as an Easter present(I had run out and no other scent would do).  I truly love this perfume.
B0001F3QQE|4|I had quit wearing mascara.  I naturally curly lashes and inevitably, before the mascara dried it would clump and end up all over my eyelid. Then there was the mess with taking it off.     With this product I am able to bring my little peepers out of hiding.  People have actually commented on how bright my eyes are.  It couldn't be easier to apply....or remove.  LOVE it!
B0012C8TXU|5|i purchased this from one of indiana's local tanning salons &i love it the smell is awesome&whatever it has in it.if you also have a cut or something like that it heals it up as well so this product can be used for after tanning of course or even to heal cuts&even my neighbor had a cold sore i put a lil in his hand he put it on that&it was gone in 1day so perfect for lots of stuff.main thing i love the smell&how shining it leaves my skin=]
B00C83BVH8|1|The problem with emjoi micro-pedi pro rechargeable callus remover is that after 16 hours of charging it, the red light stays red.  It should turn green to indicate the the emjoi is already recharge.
B001DKMY9Q|4|Works well. I gave four stars because nothing is perfect. When you are using this razor make sure its wet and have some shaving cream being used.
B001JK6N3I|5|This wonder product got me through Ironman Canada without any issues or irritations. Easily the best anti-chaffing creme I've come across. I'll be lathering up again for Ironman Coeur d'Alene.  Customer services is equally excellent.
B00325D0WK|5|Love it and it works.
B0030O3VRW|4|To all my makeup lovers...... Wearing eyeshadow that are bright can look nice during the day but after a couple hours it   Smear off but with this product it last all day... It also make the eye shadow 100x brighter .......
B00898EG28|5|Yes, a mirror with a nice warm wood handle and no cheap plastic.
B00B2ARZC8|5|I have had trouble finding this product in recent months. It appears that Alterna has changed the thickening compound but it still meets my needs (just not as well as the previous one).
B0045WFN56|5|Good product, my salon uses this product.
B00GEL0W2A|5|I love this flat iron. I have very thick hair and it works like a dream. Would recommend this product to anyone.
B000H6A02A|2|I had very high hopes for this razor, which is rated a \\"Best Buy\\" in Consumer Reports.  The problem with this type of razor is that is could not shave closely in and out of the contours of my neck, and I would have to repeat the process several times before hair was removed.  It was also noisier than my 17-year-old Norelco.  In the end, I sent back this razor and bought a cordless Norelco, which is far better at removing facial hair in less time, and it is much quieter as well.
B002LCBBMQ|2|thought this stuff smelled like Pine Sol cleaning liquid. Almost any of the other choices top this one so avoid.
B0047ENKDE|5|I have issues with my lips always being chapped. Since I got this, my lips have never looked better. It smells and feels great.
B00141G4PO|5|Great for a 24 hour shadow look or trimming other areas of the body... For crew cuts I go no smaller than a number 2.
B00CHHL1AW|5|This is my all time favorite mascara and I don't think I'll buy another kind.
B0002KHU3I|4|It's good
B0095CQOE0|5|This product arrived early and was in perfect condition to give as a gift even though I am keeping it for myself. The packaging wasn't damaged at all and arrived exactly how I expected. Thank You
B00BCON55A|5|This product is excellent for treating dry chronic wounds. A good product for direct application to the dry wound bed. In addition, I have found it to be a good product for moistening gauze used as the wound contact layer.
B00011JZWW|5|I have used this product for about two years and my heels are as soft as a baby's!!!  The price and super fast shipping can't be beat.
B00A46OKDS|5|I like this smell.
B00EQP9CHM|5|Just what I needed!  Thanks for the quick shipment!
B003ILBO62|5|I have not use it yet but  it's exactly  what I expected. I assume it's better than using the brush.
B002VWL2L6|5|Smells wonderful!
B001CT07PQ|4|I always prefer a perfume to an eau de toilette, but this one is quite nice. It is not sweet and my daughter says it smells very nice on me. Or course, fragrances behave differently on different skins. This one lasts 4-5 hours on mine. I'm very likely to buy it again, although I'm always open to new fragrances.
B00B8UIERM|3|I was dissapointed when I opened this and saw that I really couldnt see any holo in the inside light... even under a bright lamp it was VERY fant. If you are lookin for really good holos try the color club halo hues... China glaze is my favorite nail polish company but this just wasnt impressive for a holo. It is a very beautiful color though.
B000GGD3HK|3|A little smaller than I expected that's probably my fault though. Brush wise it is a nice brush.
B00BT9TWCS|1|Full of fiber, don't look like the picture. The color is off. Black is a number 2 in color. Don't buy.
B00JKCUCOS|1|The acrylic liquid is too sticky. Frustrating to use. Worst product ever. Doesn't deserve a star
B001TMFXBE|1|This pill crusher doesn't work at all.<br />I tried to crush caplets.  .....Nope.<br />I tried to crush capsules .....Nope.<br /><br />The screw action top simply stops turning when it reached the top of the pills or capsules in the bottom.
B00852JKK6|4|This is a nice color that is perfect for summer or spring, my daughter loves it as well, good buy.
B00A8Q970K|5|awesome product sealed my split ends and made my hair super soft n shiny .love this product 5 stars
B001ET6XDE|5|This is a super moist lipstick and this color gets many compliments when I wear it.  The ordering process was simple and I'm glad I can still buy my favorite lip color.
B004LQGQ48|5|I love gel shellac and was going to to the salon to get them because the manicures lasted so long.  It is so nice since I purchased the USpicy Professional UV Acrylic Gel & Shellac Nail Dryer, I can do my own manicures at home and save the money and time going to the salon....  It works wonderful and my nails turn out just like the salon...
B004OHQR1Q|5|The only problem I have with this is that two of the sticks have one end that are the same size. Though this doesn't really mater since there are already plenty of sizes on these.
B003YJAZZE|5|First couple of uses I wasn't all that impressed but if you actually pull your skin taught and take a little time this thing really does give an amazingly close shave. You do have to go over the tricky spots a few times but it really is a comfortable shave that with some patience can give a closer shave than my blades. Does a great job on my face, neck, chest and belly with very little irritation.
B010CKP520|2|These travel bottles leaked all over my bag. I'm positive that the cap was on securely and the bag wasn't anywhere it might have been smashed or mishandled (it happened during car travel, not on a flight). The design and size are great, but when 2 out of 3 bottles leaked I had to return them.
B0027LSEPS|5|This Oral Irrigator is simple, easy to set and use. It is portable and work great!<br />I highly recommend it to everyone, your oral health will improve as well as your smile!
B009653PQ6|3|Very pleased, good price and good product!! I am using twice a week. Delivery was quick!
B0086VI9TO|5|I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for nearly four years now, and I've finally convinced my wife to start using one. She prefers small toothbrush heads, due to an over-active dental gag reflex, so we bought a supply of compact brush heads for her. I use the standard size, also available here on Amazon, and find that both sizes last about six months is normal service, with proper usage.<br /><br />As I suggested to another reviewer who felt these brush heads wear out very quickly, it's important not to press too hard with these brushes.  As my hygienist told me, \\"Let the toothbrush do all the work.\\" Pressing hard against the tooth surfaces while brushing with the Sonicare does not increase its cleaning power, and probably causes the brush bristles to wear out faster. I have even been reluctant to replace them after six months- they look and feel fine.<br /><br />These replacements are a perfect fit for the appropriate Sonicare devices, and, at about $8 apiece, may seem somewhat expensive. But they provide good service, excellent cleaning, ease of use (compared with a manual toothbrush), and are a darn sight cheaper than dental work!
B0037HP9OA|4|this is a pretty good trimmer with a few flaws, theres 3 trimmers for this 1 for longer hair for months of hair growth , 2 the trimmer for closer cuts after you used the one by itself... right next to number 2 trimmer is  trimmer 3 which is like a foil type of shaver is the best part it cuts close like a shave without any irritation,<br /><br />cons,<br />1 trimmer by itself is ok could be wider<br />2 trimmer sucks because it pulls hair<br />3 trimmer/shaver is great gets really close without irritation and its powerful, this part alone is what made me happy
B00GPHBZCO|5|Love the way my heels and the bottoms of my feet feel.  Worth the money.
B0067K7XDY|5|thank you
B00IIC0EOE|5|Awesome brush.  Just the right size and angle for me to use.  Doesn't scratch and appears to be well made
B004CQZL9S|5|What I like best about this face wash is that I can use it to remove mascara (non-waterproof) without having to be rough on my eyes. I have been using it for years, and my skin was the happiest after I stopped using harsher cleansers (even during my acne periods in college) and used this with a spot cleanser for blemishes. Also, the smell is understated and pleasant. I had to buy it here on Amazon because my local stores weren't carrying it anymore. :/
B0001BNNZM|5|absolutely perfect!! great scent!!! I would definitely recommend to others to buy. I'm looking forward to ordering it again. One of kind scent
B008RQNFIS|5|Great cushion, gives a very natural finish.  Not exactly matte or wet but just gives a real nice glow.  All-day stay for most of my face- well my forehead is just supernaturally oily.  I used the Innisfree long wear cushion and Hera is wayyyy better, no contest.  This cushion is also more saturated and contains more product than the Innisfree one.
B0013NBWAA|5|Sorry to see this discontinued in local stores. Thank goodness for Amazon. Perfect for those with light or thin brows.
B00F008GFQ|5|No.. I won't buy this again.. Cause the quality is so good I don't think I need another brush anytime soon... I have all three of there brushes, Angled and the tapered foundation brush... I wash them after every use and have not seen any shedding so far.. I do sort of dampen the brush before applying foundation.. but it does give a beautiful finish.. Definitely recommend it to anyone who would like to try a high end product at an affordable price..
B000C1Z4X0|5|Very cool smell
B00O8ODHOA|5|Great toothbrush my mouth always feels clean and with Bluetooth it is like a toy. Makes oral care fun!!!! And I am 55.
B00VQHMQWG|5|Awesome oil. Can't wait to keep using it!!
B000KOI6RK|5|Love it!  It's gentile enough to keep your hair in place.
B00TP000GK|5|Great service & product
B005DJ5AFS|5|these are quality gloves that are very comfortable, wash well and do not loose their shape!  I recommend them they are great!
B00L5O4IRG|5|works miracles my face never looked this good.. although its drying i use a moisturizer to help with that. i prefer the dryness over pimples all over my face
B004GT440S|3|This product works great for my dad who has thick hair, but I have fine hair and it tends to weigh my hair down. It looks more oily than with other products for me. But as I said, if you have thick hair it's great.
B00FRDPPRS|4|smells great and thickens hair. IT DOES NOT ADD MORE HAIR it makes it look fuller.
B00OI4ANG0|4|I bought this product for my husband. He had been embarrassed about his recently thinning hair so I decided to helpd as much as i could. We decided it would be best to stop the hair loss before it was too extreme. I bought this product for him to try. He says he loves it! He says he can see a difference in he hair and that the product is much simpler to use than other hair regrowth products. Hair loss can be a sensitive subject for some men, thankfully they can order this product with peace of mind.
B00HHG128O|5|Amazing.
B000QV9YXW|4|I am a massage therapist and am always looking for tips for my clients.  I love this for myself.  It saves me trips to the chiropractor.
B001R2S8HM|5|I bought the peppermint bodywash and the shea butter bodywash from Burt's Bees. Vitacost, which is the amazon dealer, delivered the items in record time at no charge as long as I bought $50 worth of product. The peppermint bodywash is fantastic and foams up. The shea butter is OK, however, it does not foam and it does not smell that great. The peppermint tingles; and I would buy it again.
B0050HO9MI|5|I don't have a $50 German razor to compare this to, and now why should I? I wanted to experiment with safety razor shaving without investing a huge amount of money. I'm not into shaving as a hobby and am more interested in functionality than aesthetics. This does the job just fine.
B008PEMR0O|3|I would say I love it because it's so much better than my 1000 model I used before (especially love the sensitivity function so you don't push too hard on your teeth) but I'm a little freaked out that item delivered to me may not be new because when you buy this at the store, the toothbrush and all its parts are prepackaged in one hard plastic container. I've seen them for over $100 at the store so I bought it online for $65 but it was delivered in pieces! maybe its refurbished or something. have no idea. so gross that I don't know how many people touched it or did what to it. Just didn't seem new which is super gross since it's a hygiene product for your mouth!
B003FIP504|5|Medium to light coverage, but overall the best foundation I have tried. Does not bother my skin at all. Color is similar to the 3-C loose powder foundation from Larenim which works well as a good summer color for me.
B001ECQ3Y0|5|i am a germophobe so i wash my hands constantly, they use to crack and clued until i started using this soap. when i ave guests over they always say how much they love the smell of my soap :)
B00H09L558|5|Great product! Great price.
B003UM6TJG|4|I needed a mini cup to hold acetone for working on false nails. This did the job. I wish it was slightly bottom heavier, but otherwise it was small and worked well. Made of glass.
B001AM6484|4|Love Burt's Bees, this color was too light.
B005R99LT0|5|this was perfect for a sampler of the moroccanoil hair line products. THe conditioner detangled my hair, and the oil was amazing! I LOVE the way it coaxed my hair without the need of using a lot! this was a great way for me to determine that I NEED the original size!!!!!
B005ESAMQU|5|I purchased this travel set as a starter kit for my new (but small) wig collection. I did a litle research on the company beforehand and finally decided to order it afer reading \\"bad smell\\" reviews on several other brands. I love that it conveniently has everything you need to properly care for your wigs for a reasonable price. It smells pleasant like regular shampoo and conditioner and helps tone down the synthetic smell in all wigs. It also improves the texture of kanekalon fibres (though it says you can use this on human hair as well), making it softer and more natural-like. Overall a great buy!
B00JUJ1E0W|5|We really love this product.  I won't buy anything else.
B002RS6JPI|5|So far so good. Product arrived on time. I like the light feeling of a gel on my hair. I know there is no product that is going to make my hair thick again but this product gives the illusion of thickness. It provides volume with no stickiness or extra weight. I also like that it doesn't seem to make my hair dry or frizzy looking.
B000WN45ZG|4|This is certainly not the best constructed tiara. If you were thinking of getting this for a perfect wedding you may be disappointed when viewing it up close. But it is very pretty once in her hair and viewed from a few feet away. It was big hit at the bachlorette party, and is cheap enough to buy it just to wear around the house and feel like a princess. Overall, a great buy.
B000IEOHEI|5|I LOVE spackle!  I am a mature woman, and need something to \\"fill in\\" the lines and large pores, before using foundation.  This does it!!  With the aging process, using foundation, just wasn't working for me.  Every small wrinkle and pore was accentuated with foundation, even with cream foundations.  However, I came across LG Spackle quite by accident, and now use it every day.  It completely \\"smooths\\" out my look.  I haven't tried the eye spackle yet, but I am going to order it too.
B00FZESMKG|4|Good product.  Has integrity
B00AK4ZGB4|5|It's perfect! Just what I wanted
B006QB4OCM|1|Very disappointed with this egpytion musk oil no where near what the original one smells like,I could of saved my money went to a Dollar Store and received better results. Is there any company out here who sells the Real Deal Egyption Musk Oil please let me know,I'm so disgusted with this now it's only used as a oil burner around the house I wouldn't dare leaving my house with this scent on smelling like cheap perfume if only I knew Egyption musk oil would become distinct Lord knows I would've stocked up years ago from the Muslum guys selling the real deal..
B00AFFGQF8|4|my mom i love your gift recommended
B000GGKPS0|5|I was having real difficulties and had tried several products but this proved to be the one I was able to use and it works.
B004UL1AFE|1|It burnt my skin. I will not use it again or recommend it.
B0057GWGI6|5|I have multiple cats in the house and need something like this in order to make sure the house smells fresh.  The scent is not overpowering and the house smells clean.  Thank you for this product Febreeze!  It makes living with cats a lot easier.
B00BH2EC04|5|Love it!
B0000691JH|4|So far I am impressed with Moom. This is my first time using any sugar or waxing product, so I did have some missed hairs/broken hairs, but I'm sure that's just user error and won't be an issue with some practice. There were plenty of cloth strips included, and they were very easy to rinse clean. It hurt, but that is expected when you're pulling out hair. Afterwards, my skin was left very soft. The jar is small, but if you're using a thin layer as directed, I think it will last a long time. I am looking forward to throwing away my razor.
B003X4G23O|5|Been using this for years and it's still the best.
B00HMEBRKO|1|Worst razor I ever used.  It took me 14 minutes to shave with it.  I had to go over my whole face 40+ times to get a mediocre shave.  I've been using safety razors since I was a teenager, and my wife gave me this because it looked similar to my 50 year old Gilette, but looks is where it ends.  I hope she kept the receipt.
B0073YKJHK|1|It wasn't a problem with irritation, as I had little to no irritation with this product.  The problem was, it removed zero hair under the surface of the skin.  Much like most other products on the market, it simply burned off the part of the hair that it touched, which makes it pretty much as effective as shaving.  I could see hair at the skin level immediately after use, and I had serious stubble the very next day.  The product was a complete waste of money for me.  To be fair, not every product works for everyone, but also to be fair, realize there are a rash of products sold online that pay people to give them positive reviews, so I don't know where this one fits.  Could be either way.  On a side note, it looks like this company is run out of someone's basement.  It came in a Ziploc bag, and the instructions were photocopied.  I'm not kidding.  They were actually photocopied.  Couldn't afford printing costs for real brochures, I guess.  The glove is pretty lame too.  Looks like something a five year old lost on his way to kindergarten...in 1962.  Very disappointed.
B001JK6EZU|5|This is the authentic stuff. Do the math and if you like Aveda's volumizing tonic, then you should buy it in this size.
B009NE5Q3U|3|Does not work well with thick hair. Has a hard time holding tightly. Friend with fine hair had no problem.
B000VOLD5Q|5|Gave it 5 stars because this is my daughter's favorite perfume, going back many years. I also ordered it for me, since the smell pleased me too.
B00CSBJBUO|5|lovr love , the only complaint was, they were silver rather thab gold, put i didn't complain,they were still beautul.
B0013MTHWQ|5|I have fairly sensitive skin and am extremely prone to razor burn on my thighs and in the \\"bikini area.\\" Venus Embrace blades are the best I've used both in terms of minimizing irritation and getting an amazingly smooth shave. I'm guessing it has something to do contour of the razor head as well as having moisture ribbons on both the top and the bottom, but whatever the reason I'm glad I found these and I highly recommend them.
B003IXP6P0|5|My wife has used Original Noxzema frequently for over 60 years and couldn't find it in local stores any longer. She was delighted to be able to get Noxzema again.
B00690ED0I|5|A little irritation the first time I used them, but have used them several times since with no problems. Love how well they clean.
B00NMZVXOM|5|great!
B001K1EQ26|5|This one piece ileostomy appliance works, at least for me, the best for me. One piece ileostomy appliances have advantages over the two pieces and the Convatec 22771 is one of the better ones.
B00GYF65TK|5|great
B00GMP1S3U|5|Love this product!
B0058E3XJI|5|This one is very good! Smells good, feels nice. Bought a second bottle for my sister as a gift and she equally loves it
B004YRTZG0|5|I am recently transitioning to natural hair.  I have used Wen with no complaints.  The CON argon oil shampoo makes my hair look and feel amazing.  I have very thick course hair.  This shampoo tames my hair while adding so much volume.  Yes, the smell could stand some improvement.  However, the product works really well for course, dry, brittle hair, and transitioning locks.
B00ABTV7WU|4|It's a nice otaku-item for those who like Gintama or just cute chibi boys (my case). Print quality and fabric quality are  fine. However, the fabric was not polyester peach skin, as the description said, but some sort of corduroy-ish textile. It's also nice, but I wish I knew it in advance.<br />You can remove the pillowcase to wash/iron it if necessary.<br />Looks nice on practically any sofa without patterns (like ours).
B00CLKX9WS|5|love this product. ive had such a hard time trying to find this shade for a decent price. i recommend you apply chapstick before use.
B0026SFVXK|4|My wife used them and really enjoyed them they were very nice, and would recommend them to anyone that does nails.
B003UROGOG|5|great sissors
B005C2NBCK|5|I was looking for a body oil that wasn't outrageously expensive and didn't contain any petroleum-derived oils.  I picked this body oil for it's ingredients--olive oil, jojoba oil, almond oil, and vitamin E are all in this bottle, with olive oil (which will absorb into the skin) being the primary ingredient.<br /><br />I absolutely love this product, and it's been excellent for my skin.  I use a small amount all over my skin after my shower, and my skin is soft and moisturized, even in the middle of winter.  The oil smells great, which is another plus.<br /><br />I was able to purchase this product for $10 at Target, and it is well-worth that price.<br /><br />TLDR:  effective moisturizing oil with quality ingredients usually found in higher-priced body oils.
B00CE2JC9W|4|It's too soon to determine if this really works.  I have noticed some difference in stretch marks, but I'm not sure if it's the roller or the moisturizer that I'm using.  Previously, I had given up on getting rid of stretch marks.  We shall see.
B0009ION0G|5|TIGI Catwalk &#34;Your Highness&#34; Root Boost Spray is the best of the best.  Goes in easy, dries without clumping, holds for hours.  You won't be disappointed!
9790791240|5|This was purchased for my wife.My recomondation to all males species is! Spend more on perfume,a lot more than I did.Not to say, this is not a nice perfume.After all, your sins will dictate, what ammount you gonna spend!
B00BSYHUIC|5|Much more effective than plastic ones I've used before. The extra cost is worth it to me. And being made of metal it will last for many years.
B00005JS5C|4|It does the job but I wish it could shave closer. So, I want to try maybe a men's electric razor so maybe I could skip the shaving part when I use this.
B009740IOS|2|These eyelashes are of very poor quality (you get what you pay for....). They are very rigid and cheap and do not suit the lower lashes at all.  However -- I'm using them two ways:  I snip the band into tiny segments and glue three or four &#34;individual&#34; hairs to the bottom eyelid, and of course toss them at the end of the day..  They look much more natural that way.  Also, when I want a total natural look on the top eyelashes, I will use them to supplement my upper lashes, making them appear fuller, but not longer.
B000GBID0M|5|There are all kind of electric toothbrushes on the market at all kind of prices.  As far as I am concerned this is the best value.  It is economical and does a great job.
B00JVXVCS6|5|Product is so good. I have always been a Shea butter advocate and this product truly works wonders for my skin. It's also great on hair too!
B0009F79EQ|5|I've been using this on and off over the years for my piercings, it works really well in cleaning and reducing swelling caused by inflammation and also reduces the size of the bumps that normally pops u when you have a cartilage piercing. I use it in conjunction with coconut oil to add moisture after this has dried up. I'll always go back to it. the price on here was good with free ship.
B006TJ0OX4|5|I have sensitive skin and it has been really hard to find products that suits my face.  As soon as I received this, I tried it and I absolutely love it.  It leaves my face nice and clean, and I can already feel my face firmer.  but most of all, I did not have any irritation to this at all.<br /><br />The shipping was not trackable, but it arrived way sooner than the expected date.  I am truly happy with this product and also with the seller!  its A + + + for me.
B00CO4DUSE|5|Arrived before time, came in one package, none broken, however the only negative thing I can say is the nail tips are for smaller nail plates, I have larger beds and the #1 fits my index so I would have to build one for my thumb and I'm not a heavy person. But overall I'm very satisfied got lots of GOOD tips at a low price, very well worth it.
B003XDQ77G|5|I used Aquafresh sensitive toothpaste for years and then it became very difficult to find in stores, so I switched brands.  The other sensitive toothpastes that I've tried never did the job thoroughly.  I always seem to have some sensitivity. Aquafresh works very well for me. I never experience sensitivity was long as I use it regularly.
B00R78RXUI|5|I didn't get mines from amazon ...but is my most favorite face washes ....I love the smell of it and it's not harsh on my oily/ sensitive/ acne prone skin.it never broke me out (always a plus) glad I can get it on amazon when I run out
B001VEK1IU|1|People have stated that this cutter may have recently changed for the better--the answer is NOPE.™ I ordered these on June 1, 2015 and it's the same exact blade I've been using for at least 3 years. Despite being brand new, it still PULLS my hair out of my face. Do you get how much that sucks? It's not fun to have hair being ripped out of your cheek.<br /><br />I'm not even talking about a thick beard -- I couldn't grow a beard to save my life. Thin, short, white peach fuzz and this cutter can't even handle it. Are you nuts?<br /><br />I have the Braun 360 model 8985 that says &#34;Made in Germany&#34; on the back that I bought sometime in 2007 or so and the original blades I had in it as everyone said were perfect. Can anyone with confidence tell me where I can buy an ACTUAL good replacement cutter for this model? I've had enough of misinformation and I've had enough of bracing myself for pain each time I shave. Unacceptable. Please, someone, anyone, direct me to the Quality Cutters.™
B000FED5D0|5|This was a great purchase and the 3rd Norelco trimmer I have owned. It was priced right and trims perfectly with multiple settings. <br /> <br />The vacuum feature of the trimer is fantastic compared to the older  models which shot trimmings out all over the sink area. <br /> <br />The only draw back is no travel pouch is included like my older models, but it fit in the older model pouch which I did not throw out.
B00JJIP1T4|5|Loved them
B005UKT9LG|3|This pallet looked so promising. I have to admit the colors look amazing they are all gorgeous and great for playing around and exploring. I love almost every shade! however the pigment payout is AWFUL. some colors are more pigmented then others. they looked great when I swatched with my fingers but when applied they seemed to barely show up. to the point where its almost pointless to apply. however there are so many great shades in here i'm glad i bought it. it's great for a lazy day when you have a lot of time to play with your make up and take your time applying enough layers that they show up. be careful because the colors almost look muddy if you use too much product. theres some great shades and it was well worth the price but this pallet is not a go to every day one for me.
B0041TXR1A|5|Works great as an insect repellant when diluted in distiller water.  Great mixed with lemongrass essential oil too!
B0013L7GE8|1|This Fendi perfume was sent from Jerusalem.  It was NOT the Fendi fragrance that I had purchased and worn for over twenty years before the manufacturer took it off the market.  It certainly was not worth the $194.00 that I paid for it.
B000B9H2JW|5|This bath scrubber is fantastic!  I can reach all the parts of my body and the bristles feel as if they are massaging my body.
B00A8XHCC8|5|Refreshing smell and lightweight. Nice for summer.
B0049LUI9O|5|This is the third brand I've tried but the first one that actually worked. In fact it works very well. Thank you Panasonic for a wonderful product.
B000CP0MMO|3|Ehh...I wasn't too impressed with this polish. It looked like White-Out on my nails and chipped/peeled very easily. I guess I expected it to be a little more sheer and not so chalky white looking.
B004679YTG|2|Used for 30 days no physical change
B003MT2UF4|5|I can finally scratch my back!
B003GRD5ZG|4|a bit expensive, but worth it; thick and creamy - perfect for night time, and day us in very dry areas. i recieved the product in a timely manner.  thank you.
B004YL64RE|5|Love these wipes.  Just like bigger name brands, at better price (and I'm a bit of a product snob). Great for travel (why I first bought them - so I didn't have to bring travel size containers of my face wash and use up precious space in my 3-1-1 baggie), but I now use them for everyday makeup removal too.
B00HDP7CHY|5|When I ordered this product it came fast!  I was glad there was no waiting around for it.  I have been using it on my feet and feel that it has helped my mood and given me a more calm throughout the day, especially during my monthly cycle.  I also used it on my face combined with Tea Tree oil to clear acne.  I pulled a muscle in my back shoveling snow and massaged it into the area and the next day the pain was gone.
B001M4XYK6|5|As a healthcare worker, constantly washing my hands, this is by far the best lotion bar I have every used.  I have ordered more for my co-workers.  Even my manicurist made a comment on the softness of my  hands.  This stuff is incredible.  Lindy Friedman
B00O7I9H0U|5|Perfect accessory for a cosplay I was doing. Fits and stays put. Love it!
B003UKM90Q|5|We have had our Oral-B tooth brush for over 10 years and it just bit the dust 2 weeks ago, so I was on the hunt for a new tooth brush. Well, as you can guess, this one ended up being the winner! And I am glad we purchased this model over the higher end ones OralB has in their product line.<br /><br />Out of the box, you have to charge it 16 hours before your first initial use. And once this baby was fired up, YOWZA! I don't think my teeth have felt this clean in a long time. Which I am attributing to the floss action head that we are using with this.<br /><br />I do wish this had a charging light, with seeing that gives me comfort that it is meeting the contacts on the base and I can rest assured knowing it is charging, without it, I can only \\"hope\\" it's working.<br /><br />I also love that we have a variety of heads to choose from, being as my husband does not like the same tooth brushes as me.
B00BCO386G|1|Does not work at all. They should put the money they spend on ad to  product and let word of mouth do the marketing.
B000N2MWCO|1|Too thin on my face and rubbed off very easily even with setting powder. Very white cast on my face.
B00GN8I36G|5|perfect size and good price
B000JPMHWK|3|Truth be told I prefer the shave I get from the Gillette twin blade razor and that includes multi blade razors
B00EOYQFVG|5|Bought at the 99 cent store and it's the best thing I've ever tried
B008RCTPR2|5|Love the dewey  shimmery finish it gives,  without beingtoo sparkly.  I haven't been able to find this in stores any longer, thank goodness for Amazon!
B005CYK8SI|3|The basic browns in this eyeshadow quad are an essential for every woman's wardrobe.  The four shades blend and complement each other regardless of which combination you choose.  If they have a flaw, it's that the colors faded somewhat and had to be replenished midday.  Some creaminess might help with this. Otherwise, it's great.
B0018C0MJS|4|Writing the review after using for couple of times in 4 months duration.<br /><br />I like this product and saves me the money that I would end up paying the the hair saloon.<br />Pros:<br />Its powerfull.<br />Good number of clippers of different sizes.<br />Cuts the hair well.<br />Cons:<br />Somewhat heavy so it is bit difficult to cut hairs on the back of your head when you are doing it by yourself.<br />Leaves some hairs un-cut even after running over multiple times.<br />I would have loved it if we had a more bigger size clipper from the biggest size provided
B00JWS9HT6|3|Way Way overpriced....check out other prices before purchasing from this person.
B007PV4756|5|I was given one for Christmas and was very skeptical as I have always spent $200 + on a good quality straightener.  I must say I LOVE it.  The curls I get are amazing and last for 3 days (by the third day it's more like beachy waves but still looks awesome).  I also love the cord that spins so it doesn't get twisted and knotted.  I see comments on here about people getting refurbished ones but those reviews should be going towards the mall kiosks they bought them at for reselling defective product.  I also recommend getting the stand that goes with it!
B007CTNHL6|3|these are cute, they are tiny but really cute, unfortunately they burned my eyes so i gave it to my daughter she liked it
B000WH6HM6|2|I purchased two Kinerase product several weeks ago based on a friend's recommendation, one was this night cream.  I'm in my late 30's with dry skin but prone to breakouts from time to time. I take very good care of my skin and was looking for a new night cream, so I thought I would give this a try.  On the plus side, this product has very little fragrance and very little is required.  But there are no dramatic results to using this $125.00 face cream.  It's average.  I didn't notice that my skin felt any softer or supple than it's felt when using a less expensive brand. No dramatic change in the appearance of fine lines.  There are face creams you can buy in a drugstore that do exactly what this cream does.
B001KYS87M|5|same as before,not repeating myself,if interested try it for yourself, what more can I say?? Lets start to move on
B00OAW1MQA|5|Perfect, Great Fit!!!
B004KVBQKS|5|It does what it is supposed to.  The diffuser works and fits perfectly on my hair dryer!  I love it!
B003H1HCIM|5|I love this perfume! I was not sure, but it is work!<br />May be there is auto-suggestion, but it seems to me that men especially look at me :)<br />I like its smell also - fresh and unostentatious.<br />Sorry for my English!
B00157YWYC|5|This is my 3rd bottle, I use it for burns and it really works to take out the pain as well as no blistering!!! it's really amazing stuff people!
B0002RSW2E|3|I used to use this product years ago and then it got to be hard to find.  I purchased this item thru Amazon and have only used it a couple of times.  The fragrence that I remember from Apple Pectin Shampoo just isn't the same. Apple Pectin Shampoo used to have this bold apple smell, this product does not. Disappointed in the product, that's for sure!
B000GI0O6G|5|Love, love, love this toilette water spray &#34;cologne&#34; however it doesn't seem to last long at least as far as I can smell.  Other people can smell it when I spray it in my hair though.  Received lots of compliments.
B005OJ537M|5|It seems like quiet a bit of money to lay down but it is durable and will last a long time. It wipes clean easily and there is one magnified side and one normal sided mirror. It makes a good gift, especially for older Hello Kitty lovers.
B007O7AYYE|4|if you over wash them the bristles will fall out...  other wise great!
B007G0GRUE|1|THESE SUCK~DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!<br />NO FRAGRANCE~TEENY TINY BOMBS!<br />THIS PRODUCT BOMBS IN A BAD WAY!!
B006UUTNCU|5|I ordered this product on a whim after seeing my Dermatologist numerous times over the course of ten years. I have a dozen Sun spots of brown [and blackish] tint on my forehead and temples. She said there is nothing operable here and no cancer. After using this product for two weeks on clean dry skin, twice a day -I can report the results now. I see a noticable fading of the most distinct sun spots. The contrast between my natural color and the spots has reduced 50%.    I consider this good news and suggest other men try it.    Thank you.
B001CDYN6Q|5|As expected.
B000UK16AI|3|Should be more reliable/durable.  Replacement is too expensive to be so short.  I can buy a lot of throwaway blade razors for the same price.
B002N5MHLK|5|The only thing this is missing is internet radio.  That's it!  :)  Best shaver I've ever owned.  Very smooth.  Feels like I used a blade.  It appears a little bulky at first, but surprisingly comfortable in the hand and very maneuverable.
B003UNPS0Q|5|I love it and works great on my hair by keeping it soft and sleek. I have natural thin frizzy curly hair,  this is good.
B00RFX553W|5|I was looking at a more expensive curling iron on another site, it had the same rotating barrel and heat options; I am so glad that I chose this one instead. Heats quickly and easily gives me the beach you waves/ curls that I wanted.
B000GGKQ16|5|No one in my family has dentures, but I buy these tablets to clean out Sigg water bottles and other bottles that aren't dishwasher safe. These work well and leave a nice, clean fragrance to the bottle. They do not impart any flavor to your beverage as long as you rinse the bottle well.
B00M6B6YWE|5|I waited purposely to give a review because I wanted it to be based on long-term results.  Well, after six weeks of use, I can say that I love it and have noticed a difference in my skin tone and overall appearance. This product is definitely and permanent fixture in my beauty routine.
B00FKNIHC0|3|I attempted to use the gel immediately after my chemical peel, and I must admit I did not feel the cooling agents at all!. However because I was uncertain of the results I would have with this product alone I painted my baking soda solution onto my face atop the gel. The effects of the acid were neutralized and I was then able to rinse with cold water. Because there was still discomfort I applied the gel again and followed the directions as printed and it added additional relief neutralize the peel.
B000NWGCZ2|5|Amazing cream! I am impressed.. I live in Montreal Canada and winters here are someting you have to get used to...having temperatures of<br />-40C  or less your skin is goes thru a war during the winter. This cream is so rich that you can feel like a &#34;protection&#34; layer over your hands afte you apply, it does not feel greasy at all...so harde to describe....I guess PROTECTION is the key word here.<br /><br />It may be a litte more expoensive that other &#34;regular&#34; creams or skin lotions but in the end, Vanicream is so rich and effective that you end using less in the long run.
B009GEUPAG|4|It arrived on time and in good condition.  I thought that it would have more of a tint to it. It is creamy and a little thick.  It also has SPF which you can smell.  I was really looking for something to apply either day or night.
B00HK6BCKY|3|This a very comfy bra. Not as much support as it claims and the band rolls up a bit, but a good around the house bra. All I can say is do NOT put it in the dryer! Mine got ripped to shreds. :(
B00J14PD1C|1|They need to change there picture to just the blue one. Because that's all your going to get. I feel scammed. Wouldn't buy from them again.
B005FVSH0O|3|These take off make up and have a pleasant scent, however they didn't leave my skin feeling refreshed. My face felt sticky afterwards each time. I'll look for another brand that is cruelty free.
B004GTJWTG|3|The smaller sheets didn't act anything like skin, didn't take ink hardly at all, and smeared when wiped. Oddly enough, the larger sheets were much better but still not perfect. Overall it was worth the price but I don't think I'd order this product again. Shipping was prompt though.
B00AN0O61G|1|This polish peels off within a couple of hours. I followed the directions exactly. Both times I did my manicure same bad results. After it dries it feels rubbery not the way polish should be. I was not even going to write a review but I don't want anyone else to waste their money.
B00APPLSVA|5|This is a very pretty pink that is suitable for those with light or medium skin tones.  I am light myself and it's very flattering on me.  I love the matte texture and it lasts quite a while without being dry at all, which is surprising for a matte lipstick.  The price on Amazon is outrageously expensive.  Sephora has this item for $24.  The only thing I don't like is that I have to carry a sharpener in my purse.  And having to sharpen it wastes some of the product.  But this is my only complaint.  Sex Machine is a pink with blue undertones and it looks great on those with pink or neutral (like me) undertones.  It is not a bright pink but rather, a soft one.  I have several of these pencils, Bettina (a light nude with a glint of pink), Sex Machine, and Dolce Vita (a soft red).  I wish there were more colors.  The matte texture is not at all drying and it has a creamy feel.  It lasts longer than other lipsticks I have, which is a selling point for me.  I highly recommend this product and also recommend buying somewhere else, as the price on Amazon is ridiculous.
B00LJI6X3A|5|Ok, this stuff actually works.  It works wonders on that bumpy skin on the back of your arms.  Apply it on in a really thin coat, otherwise it will be flaking and rubbing off.  Great product, I will buy it again.
B000NNHSTA|5|This is a great way to sort your pills and keep from spilling them on the floor and easy to get them back in bottles.
B00BPUAUB8|3|Bought these before using the first six and found out a few of them leak. I like them for the most part.
B003V264WW|4|Didn't realize it was PINK!<br />colored items more &#34;manly&#34; lol<br />But it's a good machine and should last a Loooooong time.
B002RXW5BA|5|All the colors in this palette are of high quality and has colors and combinations for any occasion. I was a little hesitant about purchasing this product cause we live over seas because of my husband's job in the navy, and I was worried that when the palette DID arrive, that many colors would have been broken and flaked all over. But when it arrived, it was packed very carefully and not a single color was out of place or harmed.   I love bright and outstanding eye shadows and being able to match whatever color shirt I'm wearing. I definitely recommend this product. I'm a very satisfied customer. :)
B009086340|5|Have been using these for two weeks. Great scissor with features not normally found in this range. Excellent 440c hitachi steal
B004I6EZGM|4|My mom loves this fragrance.  Delivery packaging. Well satisfied with this purchase.
B004FVROT0|5|I love the Salon Care brands at Sally's Beauty Supply.  I have the 30 volume and 40 volume developers, the Salon Care Blue Flash lightening powder, and of course a bunch of other products I can only find at Sally's.<br />The developer works and smells great - I highly recommend it - plus it's CHEAP!
B001VE6KJ4|3|This box is different from another I received from the same company. The sticks are darker in color, burn differently, and not as pleasant to smell. Not bad, but not as good as I was expecting.
B001Q26X8E|5|nice wide tape
B00LTN9Q7K|5|Makes the face look younger somehow.
B004YBW5T0|3|Very fast shipping.  I will give them that.  However, what I received looks nothing like the picture.  It has little to no smell like some of the other reviews but it has a off white greenish tint to it. Not a big deal for what I'm using it for, but not exactly what I expected either. Was packaged in a Bag which was inside another sealed bag.  Would probably look elsewhere next time I need some.
B0083ZLXFU|5|Love this fragrance! I wish that it lasted longer on my skin but I love it so much anyway!
B00ITITKU6|1|didn't work on me at all
B00E4MNQQA|5|Great product for the sensitive skin. Always used Noxzema when I was a young, but stopped. Now that I'm older, it's been difficult finding products to work without over drying. I decided to go back to Noxzema and so thankful I did! It is amazing to see how much dirt these blemish pads take off even after washing my face!
B006H780AM|5|I actually ordered Medium blonde but was sent medium brown.<br />It looks fine anyway, so I kept it.<br />The product does exactly what is intended, to fill in the look of thinning hair.<br />It's easy and quick to use.
B000Y1FXUM|5|Repeat customer.  Excellent product for dry eyes.  Good buy and convenient to purchase through Amazon.
B00CCG7UQC|5|These are great little scissors and at at decent price. Very sharp, not for the  little ones - sharp points, sharp blades and sharp appearance.
B006R5HM6M|5|If you're a guy who doesn't want a perfumy shampoo, this stuff is great. I like to leave the conditioner in for about 1/2 hour. My hair looks and feels wonderful afterwards. Recommend.
B003S56KNK|4|Good service, good price'
B00IJQDZTU|3|It does make your eye lashes fuller and longer however the fibers land in my eyes every use...
B000ALCJR6|5|Great dryer! Drys hair quickly and leaves hair soft with out the frizzies! <br />Great price shipped quickly with no shipping charges
B00WV2ZF4Q|5|This eye cream has a dewy feel and left my eyes feeling moisturized without being oily.  Helped some with the appearance of wrinkles, however did not make them go away.  Would continue to use to protect the delicate tissues around the eyes.
B00AUFSS90|4|was good for the price
B00383I8T6|3|I bought this hoping to be able to quit shaving and because I'm not overly tolerant of pain so didn't want to try lasering...I was REALLY enthused about it thinking it would be the thing for me.But it turns out it does not work all that well...it didn't work at all on my legs where the hair is quite coarse and black.Nor did it work on my underarms or bikini line where the hair is also coarse and black.It worked fairly well on my arms and face where the hair is much fairer and finer...but it still left stubble.So now I'm back to shaving my arms, which I don't really like to do, and epilating my legs,which is painful,and if you use Dr. Numb is a long process.I do still use it on my face but not really regularly.I haven't noticed that the hair is thicker or thinner...just about the same.The buffer worked the first time I used it and got most of the stubble off ,but hasn't worked very much since.So if you have fine hair,this will work for you but if not,then I wouldn't advise trying it.
B000MDDSUY|1|After faithfully using this product as directed, I saw no improvement.  I came back and did some research.  Majority of the 5 star ratings come from folks who have left only one review. Should have checked before buying.
B004GFWSUA|3|Stays on petty good.  My sister let me try hers.  Expensive wish it was cheaper.
B002LE8P96|4|GREATT CURLING IRON! It gets hot really fast and makes cute curls. The wand is different from the picture. It is like a baseball barrel instead of a flat top.  That is the only con.
B000N758A2|5|but the package was not secure on shipment and my cap is broke.
B0065I0UMO|5|I've been told by my dermatologist that I have the driest skin she's ever seen. I live in metro Phoenix, Arizona and it is DRY here! I've tried several different moisturizing lotions and creams and only two have worked, and this is one of them (the other is PCA's Body Therapy). Both products keep my skin soft and supple for more than 24 hours. I also use this on my feet as they get very brittle and dry, then bleed. This helps my feet immensely. I don't mind the fragrance...in fact, I like it.<br /><br />Different people and different skin conditions will either like this cream or not, but for me, it has been immensely helpful.
B00I3OYLSM|5|Like many of the reviewers here, I've burned through quite a few options (some pretty silly, in hindsight) in my attempts to combat snoring. Finding the right option for your own unique issue can be challenging, but Theravent is definitely that right option, for me. The initial period necessary to adjust to sleeping with Theravent (3 nights for me) was slightly annoying, and I'm still considering minor adjustments with the Lite and Max offerings. But once I adjusted, the problem disappeared. Or so my girlfriend tells me. I feel better-rested, and she's less cranky - the definition of a win-win.
B003UKM9CO|3|The toothbrush works fine but I wonder if I got one that was sitting around in the warehouse too long. The instructions say that you can leave the toothbrush off the charger for up to a week, but I've noticed the motor runs more slowly if I leave it off the charger for even a day.
B001CT0AH6|2|I got the cologne a week ago and I wish I would have ordered the original. Fraiche just lasts like 20-30 minutes and I am not exaggerating. I would stick with the original Issey.
B008AOTPMC|1|We use the little pumice pads you get at Tractor Supply for about $3-$4 but they wear out quick.  I was hoping this stone would last longer.  It is too smooth and didn't remove the bots at all.  I tried to rough it up on concrete but it doesn't seem to work or get the stone rough enough.
B001RAULDI|4|I really like this perfume, however it comes in a plastic bottle :(  Maybe I am weird about these things, but I really love perfume in a glass bottle. I understand that for travel purposes (or carrying it in your purse) plastic might bemore practical. I really hope the regular size bottles are not all switching over to plastic...
B005WWQXB6|5|I absolutely love this. Though it's just a brush, it is a SUPER brush. I give this 10,000 stars. I have very long hair and have yet to have this pull or yank at my head at all. Love love love.
B009X75NDU|5|I really love them. I love doing nail designs on them. They are perfect for what i was looking for. You get 100 nails to design. Also, they came sooner then i was expecting! the only thing i would complain about is that nail polish remover doesnt really work on them. But i only wanted to take away a design once. One of the best purchases i've made.
B000GIOBY2|5|excelente
B004XOM4PS|2|This product is basically just baby powder that has a slight brown tint. It still leaves a powdery looking film on my brunette hair even though it says its for darker shades. I can use it, very sparingly, in a pinch to freshen my hair - but it really is a minimally adequate product. I much prefer spray in dry shampoos that I have since found. I use the big sexy hair dry shampoo when I have a lot of product in and would like volume and hold, and paul mitchell for more natural days.
B000HGGP5G|5|Arrived earlier than expected.  Only negative was the shipping which cost as much as the product itself.    I've always been a fan of Nivea lotion, and this bottle didn't disappoint.  It's not greasy and goes on pretty smooth.  Not much of a scent which is fine.  Definitely feels refreshing.  Will buy again.
B008MN7QDG|5|LOVE this brush, firm enough to whip up a good lather let soft and comfy on my face, don't listen to the talk about the smell it is VERY VERY minimal.  I washed it a couple of times with shampoo and conditional and shaved with it twice and it is barely noticeable.  I bet within a week there will be no smell at all.  I like that this brush is a natural hair brush and not synthetic yet the hair was harvested without killing the animal.
B006G56CP0|5|The product is fine. What they don't tell you is that there is a plastic disk between batteries to prevent battery drain. Take that out. It seems to work, I know that most professional whitening uses trays, gels and uv light. Does it 100 produce results? Hard to say, but it seems to help so why not?
B009XHGGMM|5|great blades.
B00A6G0T9U|5|I've been using Glacial Blue for over a decade and love it.  My dentist is always surprised at how little cleaning my teeth and gums need at visit time.  I also love the fresh, sort of minty taste as it makes my mouth tingle in a good way.  I use it morning and night!  New drip bottle is even better and easier to travel with.
B00H5WB4U6|5|Very pleased. Love it!
B00QWV9HQY|5|Rosehip oil is an important part of my daily skin care routine.  100% organic (a must), no animal testing, and an easy-to-use dropper bottle make this product great!  Shipping was fast as well.
B006J6R23M|3|I bought this hoping it would help me with my fine limp hair. Although it did wash my hair good and not dry it out as much, my hair was just as limp as before I started to use this shampoo.  It does smell really nice and leaves your hair with a very pleasant subtle scent.  My husband liked that. I guess I am still looking for the shampoo to help put life back into my hair.
B00NGZE17E|5|super seller!  Item arrived promptly, well-packaged and exactly as advertised.  Caldrea soaps are wonderful, but hard-to-find. Thanks much for this item!!
B003UBGIM0|5|great!
B00K72JFK2|5|This wig is stunning. The bangs are a little long but nothing you can't pin back, Its long and the curls are great. Works amazing with a curling iron
B001OI0YOY|5|I got this for my wife and she loves it. She uses it when she gets out of the shower all the time. She likes the way it smells, and it's never greasy. This is her new favorite.
B0008GGH58|5|Bought this for my mother. She says it is awesome, also; she loves that it is so cheap and comes in such a large amount.
B004SGKMA0|5|Works great.  I have a thick beard and change the blade about once a month.  But I have gone two months without changing the blade and the blades still cut great.  At 100 count - this should last for many years.  It's nice that some companies still make a quality affordable product.  Great job Derby!
B00853F2K2|1|In my make-up routine I apply a light layer of BB cream and add another light layer of foundation in pressed powder form with a kabuki brush (the BB cream is too dark, and the pressed powder helps get the correct tone. When buying this I wanted to use it as another way to apply the powder. Instead wording the bristles were too stiff and wrong for the use of foundation. I bought this a Wal-mart and instead of taking it back I now use it when painting (as in making art, not painting a room).
B004CR1Z5Q|4|I have extremely sensitive and reactive skin. I'm a full time student right now and have polymorphic light eruption from the fluorescent lighting. I hate having to wear thick sunscreen, so I thought I'd try this with a light amount of sunscreen and it works wonderfully. It's very moisturizing, not greasy, non-comedogenic, and I don't have an allergy to any of the ingredients.
B00SJ61X8U|5|Best set ever! After leaving my old one behind at a security check point. For these I will run back to the car to save them!! LoL.
B004C7QZEM|2|I wanted to give this a try after experiencing at Spa, I am getting few acne as a side effect of my thyroid medication ( I believe). My acne versioned immediately after using this for couple of days. Had same experience after restarting. Did not work for me.
B00EVFY722|3|I like the design and the material on the outside and inside of the case/sleeve. The inside material is fleece-like and very soft. However the case/sleeve has two zippers and one of the zippers broke on like the third day of me using this product. Luckily the other zipper works and I can still zip up the case.
B000PL0RGQ|5|They are very good and cheap there are a bit longer than I'm used to but they are nice. It's a good buy.
B00N996X4G|5|I recently purchased this eye cream. So far, I am loving the results. When first opening the package I found the cream to have a pink tint to it. There seems to be no detectible fragrance. The cream itself has a very smooth texture. It is very easy to apply and somewhat cooling to the skin. I have noticed less under eye puffiness. I am happy that the product is paraben free. For the short amount of time that I have used it I would have to say it is a good product. I would definitely purchase again.
B00ID8H4NC|5|This is a great very light-weight blow dryer.
B000WFWM86|4|Was expecting item to arrive in a box suitable for gift giving.
B0057NE7NQ|5|I have tried other brands of dry shampoo and they all somewhat work.  NYM Dry Shampoo seems to leave the LEAST amount of whitish residue.  The scent is lightly lemony when it is sprayed on, but the smell quickly dissipates and I'm left with odor free, clean hair. I will purchase this again.
B00127X0U2|2|The band portion of this ponytail holder is attached to the plastic with very sharp edges. Not only did it cut my hair, it also cut my finger! Too bad because it's very attractive.
B00HNKXSZO|5|Great product...glad something finally came on the market for mouthpieces
B000MWF3CG|5|Nightly grinding occurs less often when using this convenient guard.  It is comfortable and sanitary and keeps upper and lower teeth from scraping against each other.  I found it to be easy to wear while sleeping and I woke with no damaged enamel or loose crowns.
B00LUKIP10|5|Arrived in great condition and are beautiful
B0046XNEBE|1|I am pretty sure the original description did NOT say tubes. I noticed the ounces of it seemed small, but they show a photo of a JAR as the product. So of course, I think I am getting 2 jars - small, ok, but 2 JARS nonetheless.<br /><br />I uploaded a photo - imagine my surprise when I saw what little product I got 10 bucks a tube? No thanks.<br /><br />It smells amazing and feels great on my hands, but this is going back. I highly recommend more accurate photo descriptions. I buy most of my stuff online, and I am a total beauty addict. I say this because if I could get confused, many others will. At least they added \\"tubes\\" to the description but I still feel that showing that photo is very misleading to people who may not read the whole description.
B00943LO8G|4|Seems to actually be helping!!! Will keep using combined with exercise. Price seems fair for product which is lasting longer than expected...Yay!
B0038F0Q8A|5|I've always liked Avon's products.  The water colors are very nice and I use them often.  I would like to try another color set, someday.
B001AYHNG4|4|The Bad:<br />-It's very thick and sticky. It leaves residue on everything it touches. No kissing your SO with this on!<br />-The brush bristles bent in crazy directions after the first use, making it hard to put on with any precision.<br /><br />The Good:<br />-It looks great over lipstain, which can make your lips look dry.<br />-It does make your lips appear a little bigger, though this is mostly due to the glossiness.<br />-It does sting a bit when you first apply it, especially if your lips are chapped. I personally enjoy this. It feels kind of neat.<br /><br />I recommend using this as a topcoat over lipstain or dry lipstick.
B005IG6XAM|5|Love it!
B001WAKI9A|4|I like Softsoap anyway, but have never tried this scent. It's good, but I' going to stick to the Shea butter scent, it's unisex.
B00C4M4H3I|4|Best nautral-feeling wig I own. The color I got was a reddish light brown but I'm not complaining,  it looks great on me. If I had been really wanting black I'd have been very disappointed though.
B00K2XSLS8|5|Great stuff!
B000K7MDTO|5|I've had dry, cracked skin for years and have tried just about everything out there. Found this cream in the bathroom at the Aria Hotel in Las Vegas. This is the best hand/foot cream I've ever used. It absorbs quickly, it's not greasy, and it lasts for hours. Expensive, however.
B00HZHKTEI|5|I love this! It looks like it does in the picture. The colors are consistent through the day, and it never looks dull! This is a good, cheap alternative to the Naked Palletes by Urban Decay. It works for younger children first starting out or adults. Any age group!<br /><br />I absolutely love this product, and I hope to be buying more in the future.
B00G9MV6TM|1|I have acne prone skin.  Made me break out something terrible.  Trying to find another use for it.
B001G7PMP4|5|eXCELLENT.
B007O099JM|5|What can I say, it is easy put on and it does not smudge like other eyeliners and love the color.
B0086VI9LC|5|I absolutely love this toothbrush just wish the replacement heads were not so expensive but it sure makes brushing your teeth more fun!!
B00JXIJTKM|5|I've been using this supplement for about 2 1/2 weeks and can see a definite improvement in the appearance of my skin. I will continue using this product and look forward to even better results. I will order again.
B000EM9D0W|5|I am 67 and my hair was beginning to lose it luster. I was told about this product and wow what a difference. My hair is healthy again and shines.
B003U8ESI4|4|I like it. I also have a Remington MB4040. The Remington is okay as well, but I find it under-powered. I posted a review on it a little while back. I rated it as a good trimmer, but it takes quite a few passes and patience to get a good trim. This Norelco is MUCH better trimming my beard, AS LONG AS I HAVE IT ON TURBO MODE. On regular power, I find it no better than the Remington. I keep my beard at 14mm-16mm. This trimmer is very good at that, on turbo it cuts better, and is faster than the Remington. The vacuum feature is also pretty good. I don't have near the mess I do with the Remington MB4040. The Remington does have one distinct advantage: close shaving neck hairs. This Norelco can't do it nearly as close.  :-(    Except for that, though, I've moved on to the Norelco QT4070. Battery life is good and it can run on AC as well if plugged in. The Remington won't do that. It will only run if charged.    UPDATE - AFTER 3 MONTHS: Two things - (1) With no attachment the blades do get neck about as close as the Remington did. (2) DO NOT TRY TO CLEAN UNDER RUNNING WATER! Yes, the instructions are very clear this unit is not waterproof, but I tried it anyway. MISTAKE. Took me a couple days to get it all dried out and the electronics back to working properly, this included a rice bag followed by near total dis-assembly. I think I got lucky.
B000C20ZSS|5|Good product, good price
B00JUBQM9S|1|It did nothing for me. :(  I was so hoping it would. Bummer!
B008TWV6OK|3|This scrub is reasonably priced, has a nice odor, and has true moisturizing effects.  However, I found it to be extra greasy.  Although this makes your skin softer, my tubs/showers were slippery and required daily cleaning.
B00VV2MYBO|1|Was not correct size my phone WILL NOT fit it :(
B001CI6RQK|1|I bought this product seeking an all-natural deodorant.  Immediately upon application, I experienced significant skin irritation and a burning sensation at the application sites.  This was not an Amazon Prime purchase, so I was stuck with the purchase given the return shipping expense (not worth it).  I was very disappointed.  Since this experience, I have have tried several other products and have found that JungleMan is the very best all-natural deodorant out there.  A bit pricey, but absolutely worth it.
B006WBPVNW|5|I've always wanted to read a book while having a glass of wine and sitting in a bubble bath. Now I can!
B000NXWGGU|3|The bottle reflects Nantucket Mist as the color, however it is not the true color.  It is more peachy. Almost as if it was mixed with something which has caused the color to change. $30 for two botttles that are not the exact color is disappointing.
B00GHUHJGK|5|I have only just begun to use Simply Touch but find it an extremely efficient and simple tool for administering eye drops.  I sent an email to Simply Touch to confirm about proper usage for prescription glaucoma medication and was pleasantly surprised to receive a call from the creator of Simply Touch, Dr. Silverman (it is so seldom to receive such a personal touch nowadays).  My method now, based on the instructions given to me:  using Simply Touch, put a drop in one eye; close that eye; while keeping that eye closed, put another drop of medication on Simply Touch and put that drop in the other eye; close that eye as well; keep both eyes closed for a minute or two; then wipe away an tears/excess medication from around the eyes.  The common instructions for glaucoma medication when administering eye drops in the traditional manner is to have the head leaning back and to press against the tear ducts with your fingers to avoid the medication running down into the nose.  With Simply Touch the drops are administered with the head upright; it was explained to me that there is no need to put the head back after administering the drops, nor is there need to press against the tear ducts; it is blinking, not gravity, that forces the medication into the tear ducts, so just wiping away any excess before opening the eyes/blinking is sufficient.
B001FWXKMW|5|Works well with the Vicks dehumidifier, no strange smells, great product
B004H02GE2|5|A kiosk at our local mall was selling these sets for $60! The product is good, but I was so grateful to find it on Amazon for $15.  My nails looked smooth and shiny for at least 2 weeks.
B006L1O9DG|5|9 pound baby. No stretch marks. This does what it says. This product delivers. I also used it on my feet with great results.
B00LMOJR02|5|First Impression & Packaging...<br />I was really excited when I saw that this line was coming out, as I am a die-hard fan of matte colors. Not that I don't like sparkle or shimmer -- I do, on occasion -- but my go-to type of eyeshadow is definitely matte. This new addition to the Color Tattoo collection is packaged just the same as the original colors.<br /><br />I bought the colors Creamy Beige and Vintage Plum from my local drugstore, as I knew these were two colors that I would use frequently. I was really excited to try out Creamy Beige, as it looked like a color that would be perfect to wear as the base to my eyeshadow.<br /><br />Product & Application...<br />I was rather surprised when I found out that these two shades both swatched and applied differently from each other. As you can see in the picture below, Creamy Beige came off very rich and pigmented, whereas Vintage Plum was rather patchy and sheer.<br /><br />I just swatched them both once on my arm. But just from that I knew I was going to like the Creamy Beige a lot more than the Vintage Plum. I've had the chance to try these both out on my lid over the past few weeks -- both alone and with power eyeshadows on top. I definitely love -- and constantly reach for -- the Creamy Beige. On almost a daily basis! It's just a great color to use as a base for my eyeshadows. And since (for me) it is just a few shades darker than my natural skin color, it suits me well for those natural eye looks.<br /><br />The Vintage Plum comes off patchy (like in the swatch) but if you blend it in, it won't have that patchy look anymore. Though it will be sheer. It still works well as a base under eyeshadows, though, and prolongs the staying power of my eyelooks -- so at least I will still get use out of this product.<br /><br />Major Likes & Dislikes...<br />The lasting power on both of these are great. I typically have oily eyelids and if I don't have a primer underneath them my eyeshadows won't last half the day. But I've used Creamy Beige under my eyeshadows (without a primer) and when I take my makeup off at night my eyeshadows still look as pigmented as when I first applied it!<br /><br />A definite dislike would be the Vintage Plum. I like using purple in my eyeshadows (that was the color I used for my wedding eye look), so I was hoping this would be a rich base that would enhance the purple. But, as you can see from the swatches, it doesn't apply well. And while you can blend out the patchy-ness, it leaves the color very sheer. I am able to build it up suitably, but it just takes extra work.<br /><br />Final Thoughts...<br />From my experience (with just 2 out of the 5 colors), this looks like a hit and miss collection. The Vintage Plum is nice, but I don't feel it gives off enough color to be worth buying to wear under your purple eyeshadows. I, personally, would just use Creamy Beige and then good, pigmented purples on top to get a purple eyeshadow look.<br /><br />(As if you can't tell yet...) I definitely highly recommend you purchase the Creamy Beige. I think any woman would benefit from having this color in their collection, especially if you have a darker skintone. It works great for those natural, every-day eye looks. And even if you go for dramatic and colorful, it will still work great as a base and ensure that the look you worked so hard to blend to perfection will last all day long.<br /><br />I purchased the products mentioned above with my own personal money. I was not compensated in any way for posting this review. I only recommend products that I have used personally and believe will be beneficial for my readers.<br /><br />Link to Blog Review Post -- http://www.frommyvanity.com/2014/08/maybelline-color-tattoo-leather.htmlused Creamy Beige under my eyeshadows (without a primer) and when I take my makeup off at night my eyeshadows still look as pigmented as when I first applied it!<br /><br />A definite dislike would be the Vintage Plum.

This guy features 2 settings for both the tweezer and shaver attachments.  Both are easy to remove after pressing the button for quick swaping.<br /><br />The Emjoi comes with a power supply that is required to make it run (no batteries required).  The cord has a good length to it, excellent since it does need wall power to work.  The kit also comes with a tough vinal storage bag to keep all the attachments and the Emjoi together.<br /><br />The tool and gears are mostly made of plastic, so I do hope they hold up to extended use.  Overall though, the unit works as expected.<br /><br />[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]
B001MA0QY2|5|The straightener works great! I have very thick, wavy hair and with this product I was able to get it sleek and smooth in 15 minutes. It's lightweight so my arms don't get as tired and it has a great case taking it along with me. The long cord is also a plus! Best part was the price! Definitely a great deal!
B00SKQFT4I|5|It is better than expected!  Have had many brands of hair dryers and this is the very best.  Would purchase another, but will be surprised if it will need to be replaced in the new future.  Glad to have found this product....and the price was very reasonable.
B00AE07EGO|4|I like & will buy again.
B00028LYO6|3|The shampoo bar started to work well after one week or two. The first several washes were horrible, my hair was sticky and oily, yet very dry at the same time. I am using Aussie 3 minute miracle with the shampoo now, it is working pretty good. But I started to have some splits on the end of my hair. NOT HAPPY. I NEED A WAY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. And, the soap goes so FAST. My hair is no where near long, but I still need a whole bar for ONLY ONE MONEY. It turns out to be much more expensive than liquid shampoo now!
B00C7YL55Q|5|Very refreshing and does not dry out my skin.
B00112DWY2|5|Excelente

B003NB19U8|4|This is a very soft and great eye linear which lasts for a long time on eye. I got the navy one. it has a nice color. The only thing is that it's kinda expensive.
B00FU24G9O|5|Estee Lauder's double wear foundation used to be my favorite until I discovered this. It's a whipped creamy foundation that covers amazing. What I like the most is that you can adjust the coverage to what you like or need. I put a thin layer over my entire face then go back and add a little extra under my eyes, the bridge of my nose and my chin. You can layer it as much as you like and it never looks caked on, I have very dry/combination skin and a lot of times foundation with make my dry spots look even more dried out but this foundation doesn't do that.
B00I8R7C62|4|Have really noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin.
B00658LP7I|5|Great product and works!
B00CQ7SQ3S|5|It helps. I use this when I play soccer. Too ease to use. Good price. My son likes to use too.
B007R6BMK2|3|I have been buying these events for quite a while, but this time I was not happy. The latest batch of the chocolate peppermint variety has a very distinctive cinnamon note to it. Although I received them a couple of months ago, they have been stored in a dry area, still in all of their original packaging including the sealed box and bag. They basically taste as though someone didn't clean some of the equipment at the factory between batches. Not necessarily bad (although chocolate, peppermint, AND cinnamon is a weird combination), but certainly not the flavor I ordered.
B00I0GDIWI|4|Product works great! There were a few broken glass pieces when I received but overall happy with my purchase!
B00AFPX4BW|4|[[VIDEOID:6c165d5de52c1d0928c0fe06fc596514]] One of the hardest things for me personally in going Paleo, is finding a good whitening, freshening toothpaste (I have an obsession with white teeth!). Out of all the \\"natural\\" toothpastes I've tried (and I've tried A LOT), TOM'S botanically bright has been the best at whitening. However, it leaves a weird residue in my sink and mouth, which makes me hesitate to use it.<br /><br />For more on how additives and such in toothpaste affect health, and how to easily adopt a natural lifestyle, check out my book [[ASIN:B00ODSGWPW The What When Wine Diet: Paleo and Intermittent Fasting for Health and Weight Loss]] :)
B00016XJ4M|5|Love this, smells great and is perfect to use before reading a book, magazine or do anything where you don't want to leave oily fingerprints or marks.  My husband has very dry skin but refuses to use moisturizers because he doesn't like the greasy feel.  This he'll use.  If you have really dry skin, this won't do but I love it because sometimes I need &#34;clean&#34; hands; the moisturizer will just ruin things.
B001V9AHE8|5|excellent sale. great shipping
B00HT6E2JI|5|This Schick Hydro Razor was sent to me months ago from BuzzAgent.  I love it!  It is long lasting and very effective.  I have already purchased more razors with the coupons buzzagent also sent me.  Just to have as backups.  Until they come out with something better than this, this is my holy grail razor of choice.
B00O9HLQIU|1|Found the cream too thick to spread, but at the same time, saw no difference. Maybe if I used it for a couple of months or something, it may show improvement. Not sure.
