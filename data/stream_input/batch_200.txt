B00005QZ7U|4.0|Moulin Rouge is a strange bauble of a movie-musical. It is nearly undone by its own weight, especially musical numbers that seem earnest and silly, but then win their way over you with that same magic that has been lost in cinema, a magic that only the most exciting musical films can deliver.<br />Ewan McGregor brings chills as Christian, especially as he delivers &quot;Your Song&quot;. Nicole Kidman sheds her ice princess mannerisms and invests a warmth I doubt she has ever delivered this strongly before.<br />The film is a 4 1/2 star effort, but the DVD feels a little too packed with promotional items. Sure, it has the &quot;Marmalade&quot; video and MTV performance, but I didn't care about that. The additional disc has some interesting tidbits, but exemplifies what is wrong with &quot;special&quot; packaging in that it becomes a commercial for its investors and promotions team. Moulin Rouge is definitely worth having, but aside from film discussion and extra camera angles, the additional disc isn't anything special.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|A great movie for adults. There were a few things that caught my attention for which I would not recomend this for kids (especially for conservative families or families with Islamic values). One of the scenes where the King/Prince looks at the mirror for her bride and is laying in bed sipping Martini, lifts up his blanket and says oh...anyone can get a wrong idea. Second, when the princess tried to pull the arrow from Shrek's hip, she falls on top of him and Shrek says to the Donkey, Nothing happened....<BR>Good for adults and grown ups.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I like this cd much more than any of her other ones. This cd has a different sound that is very good. Justin Timberlake is also featured on this cd with britney and the song is great. If anyone is looking for a great cd this is the one.
B000002A46|5.0|Way 2 go Mariah..this album was amazing..i gotta admit i wasn't a Mariah fan before but after{thankfully} i was forced to listen to this record, i can fully appreciate the virtuosity of the divas voice. The best selling female artist of all time, still occupies her throne...FORGET IT J-LO! AMAZING vocals ..and she doesnt go over the top on the vocals which Christina Augilera can sometimes be  a slave to...oversinging..but not Mariah! A sensational christmas album to keep you warm inside during the cold but festive Christmas period..keep it up Mariah! Glitter was great too!
1572702095|4.0|Agatha Christie is the world's best-known mystery author, and she is the most widely published author of all time in any language, outsold only by the Bible and Shakespeare.<BR>In her lifetime she wrote 79 crime mysteries and her books have been translated into more languages than Shakespeare.<BR>Agatha Christie was born in Torquay in 1890, and she died in 1979, after a lot of written novels and plays.<br />  The plot takes place in a small village, called King's Abbot, and the book features one of Christie's most famous characters, the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. <BR>Even though Poirot wants to retire after a long career, he becomes involved in a strange and mysterious murder.<BR>  The victim is Roger Ackroyd, a wealthy man who knew that the woman he loved had poisoned her brutal first husband, and also suspected that someone had been blackmailing her.<BR>After she commits suicide he gets a letter where she has written some fatal information. Unfortunately, before he can finish the letter, he gets stabbed to death.<BR>This confusing murder, which takes place in a large mansion, causes everyone at the crime scene to become a suspect.<BR>  Poirot, who is assisted by the village doctor, Dr. Sheppard, have this magical way to collect all the clues he is after. You get really surprised that he finally gets all the clues together and also how he can think of and see all things you do not even have thought of.<BR>  You read this book mostly through Dr. Sheppard's eyes and he tries to understand all the clues that Poirot gets, but he does not.<BR>Hercule Poirot unravels a lot of complicated secrets about all the suspects and you, through that, get to know the characters. You read the book, through clues and reveals, until of course he finds out who the killer is.<BR>  My personal reaction over this book is that it is very well written. All the clues and all the descriptions are very thought through. <BR>I got really surprised and shocked over the ending of the book.Actually I never suspected the person who eventually turns out to be the murderer. The thoughts that Poirot had never entered my mind, and I think this was the thing that made this book good, the astounding end.

B00001QEE7|5.0|I love this movie...  I don't know if its that I can relate to Ariels struggle or the music is great or I just think she's hot, but I love this movie.  I've only seen it in French and Spanish on the DVD version, but when I was young, I saw the english.  When she sings &quot;Partir L-bas&quot; (Or parmi ces gens for the quebec) i just get chills.. its my favorite scene.  this is just a truly great movie!

6305907145|4.0|Don't get me wrong... I love Jane Austen.  I have all her books and several theatrical adaptations, and although I am all for faithful adaptations (for Jane Austen need not be improved upon, as is exhibited in the A&E/BBC version of Pride and Prejudice), I did thoroughly enjoy this movie.  The story, though shockingly unfaithful to the actual book, was not only written from the perspective of Jane Austen's book, but also from her letters and journals (which is made clear at the very beginning of the movie).  If you are totally closeminded and cannot see the beauty in a well-made film, then I do not suggest this movie, but if you are open to new interpretations (even if they are a little modern and not quite faithful) I recommend this movie highly.  It is not a matter of being a \\"true Jane Austen fan,\\" but more about taking the movie for what it really is - an attempt to entertain - and I will end with a tantilizing quote from Fanny Price, \\"Remember, run mad as often as you like, but do not faint.\\"
0440416027|5.0|I really liked &quot;Skellig.&quot; It's about two kids, Michael and Mina, who find a strange being in their garage and try to figure out what he is. An angel? A bird? Or just a weak man with wings? This book was awesome. It was a little boring at first, but keep reading, because by the middle of the story your eyes will get practically glued to the pages.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I found Moulin Rouge a brilliant technical exercise, but completely without any meaning or any kind of good drama.  All I could ask myself watching this DVD is...why?  I wish the director would concentrate more on telling a strong dramatic story (like &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot;), rather than trying to asault his audience with MTV quick cutting indulgent &quot;coolness&quot; that masks how shallow this film really is when you look beneath its glittery surface.
B00001ODHF|1.0|let me just say that i am a big fan of the first two evil dead movies but when i finally saw this movie i was disgusted.<br />the first two might have been low budget but the make up effects were really awesome but in this one the effects were horribly done. second of all the evil dead series was set in a cabin in the woods and that's where it should've ended not in medieval times which is why i never really got into this movie.The third major point i have to make is this: Ash is supposed to fight zombies and not fake looking skeletons. I'm really thankful that they made a video game in which Ash goes back to the cabin but as far as Evil dead movies are concerned i'll stick to the first two.
B0000048V8|5.0|The snowman is about a little boy who lives in Canada? One day he decides to build a snowman. The snowman comes to life and as the story goes on, the little boy shows the snowman around his house.This is an amazing movie to watch. 1. the story doesn't have any noise. Any story that can capture the viewers or readers without any words or speaking is very special. 2. The scenery and illustrations are beautiful. 3. it's simple and sweet. This movie is especially great to watch during the holidays.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Other have dicussed this film's cliched script and insipid acting. I agree with the bulk of their criticisms. My problem is with it's arrogant and/or idiotic parade of historical inaccuracies. Torpedo planes bombing Hickam field? Radio contact between between Doolittle's Raiders and Pearl Harbor?(this technology didn't exist!). Radio contact between a walkie-talkie and a P40? (again, impossible in 1941). Survivors of the Pearl Harbor attack manning Doolittle's B-25's? (not ONE of any of the B-25 crews were present at the Pearl Harbor attack). The list goes on and on. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is a disaster in American filmmaking as well as a disservice to the &quot;Greatest Generation&quot;.
B00005OWEG|3.0|I saw this when it was first released in theatres over 20 years ago and have watched it 10 times on VHS over the years. Its a great film. A truly great, magnificent film that permanently expanded the \\"war genre\\". <br />This version undermines the classic with scenes that SHOULD have been left on the cutting room floor. Remember the surfing scene? \\"I love the smell of naplam in the morning...\\" right? Well now it ends when Willard and Lance run away from a wacky Robert Duval and they steal his surfboard! Next scene the boat is hiding under tree cover with a First Airborne chopper overhead with loudspeakers as Duval pleads \\"Please give back my surfboard.\\" Boooooo....<BR>Remember the Playboy Bunnies? In this version our heroes in a boat find them up river at a muddy tent camp in the rain and trade diesel fuel to screw them. Boooo....<BR>And then there is the scene where young Larry Fisburne rants about a GI, his Playboy magazines and the person who ridiculed them until the GI shot him\\". Larry's (excuse me, Lawrence's) mom must be the only person who voted that scrap of celluloid out of the trash can.<br />Redux? I'd call it regurgitation. I'll take my Apocalypse \\"standard classic light\\", thank you very much.
B0000028PI|5.0|One of 10 best hard albums of the 90's, if I can allow myself to sound like a trumpy CNN-style reviewer. This has all the pieces gravely missed by people who play guitar music today: experience, theatrality, taste, attitude, exquisite professionalism, lyrical craft, and even AN IDEA other than that life sucks and we should all die.<BR>Alice is at his best, pulling legs all over while sounding like a cross between the Devil himself and Snoopy the Dog. Songcraft is top-notch, with practically half the album worth a place in the general history of rock. The band, studio work and general production is typically Alice-style good; that is outstanding for the rest of us.<BR>Feels like going to rock-opera, which is amusing and entertaining without a dime of posing or rock-stardom. In one word, awesome!
B000003TSP|5.0|Dummy was great, but this is better. With this, they seem much more comfortable in the music and Geoff's creations shine through. The biggest change is that Beth seems to have lost the hesitation you hear on the Dummy tracks. The music matches her voice and pulls you in. You feel the pain with her, you feel the love. I feel drained just listening to it. It is darker and more daring than Dummy, but it seems more sincere too.
B00005R23S|5.0|A director on another concert DVD I own said that it was impossible to fully capture the essence and nuance of a show on film. Here is the exception-you will feel as though you are in the Garden with Bruce and the band. It is impossible to not get caught up in the performances, all of which are outstanding and full of incredible energy. While I am not a huge fan, I was lucky enough to catch two shows with some friends when they came through NYC and witness firsthand how great his shows are. This DVD serves as a great souvenir from those two nights.<br />The sound is fantastic and comes through clear as a bell. Not the most impressive Dolby 5.1 I have heard, but this will not disappoint any home theater owners. The video itself is also top notch-they did a great job capturing the performance. My favorite moment was when he was doing Out In the Street. Great crowd reaction shot (can't tell you what happened-that would be cheating!). My only minor quibble is with the Costas interview, but that has more to do with how much I don't like him as an interviewer. Not terribly enlightenening.<br />This DVD is a must have for fans or anybody who enjoys great rock and roll. You will not be disappointed.
B00005ATQC|1.0|I'm giving this movie only one star and it pains me to do that.  This movie was so awful and boring I could not stick with it.  Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's acting are very stiff and forced and that stupid one-tone-key piano playing throught out the movie just drove me crazy.  Before the movie was released all any entertainment magazines and/or shows talked about its strong sexual conent.  There wasn't a good enough story so the director through in a lot of sex.  It sounds just like &quot;Showgirls&quot; to be.  All that hype and then nothing.
B00005K3NR|5.0|After many, many viewings of my VHS copy of \\"Carrie\\" that I purchased in 1986 watching this DVD is like seeing it for the first time. The widescreen format and spiffy new color made me notice things I had never noticed before such as: the inside of the White's house, the set is actually like another character in the story. I watched the extras first which set the mood in regards to how much work went into this film creatively. There is no director's commentary track. Instead there are 2 separate documentary features one about the actors experence with the film and the other about the director and crew's memories of the production. All the special features are very interesting most noteworthy is the actors behind the scenes stories. All the lead actors are interviewed with one glaring absence, John Travolta. There are many quotable lines form this film most of which are spoken by Piper Laurie (Mama) Many times my friends and I uttered such phrases as \\"The're all gonna laugh at you\\" or \\"I can see your dirty pillows\\" to name a few. Bravo to Sissy Spacek and Ms.Laurie for their stellar Oscar nominated performances. You go girl(s)!
B00005R2M3|4.0|I am a huge Shakira fan, and really love quite a few songs on this album.  Great first english album, great spanish songs. I just feel like she can't express her beautiful voice as well in english as she can in spanish.  The lyrics in spanish are more soulful than their english counterparts.  I still highly recommend this album, but would recommend Pies Descalsos to those new to Shakira.  Those songs will definetly get you hooked even if you don't understand the words.
B00004Z459|5.0|I heard of this group from a friend of mine whos brother has their Cd. i heard their songs before, and i loved them, but i didn't know who they were by. when i first heard the name &quot;kinkin park&quot; i said, oh thats just another hard rock group- all shout and no lyrics. but i went out and bought their CD and it is the best Cd i have possibly ever bought, and i have alot of them. &quot;crawling&quot; has this great screaming rage on the top, but has really deep lyrics underneath. &quot; in the end&quot; is my personal favorite. it has the soulfull beat, but has great lyrics that im sure everyone can relate to. &quot; one step closer&quot; is just awesome. i love the screaming lyrics and the soft begginning. Every song on this CD is coolies- every song, not just a couple. this is a rockin CD that everyone- even britney spears wannabes- have to get!
B00005B36H|4.0|If you're too much into the really heavy stuff, then this is probably not for you, but if you're a long time Tool fan, or fan of other industrial metal bands like Nine Inch Nails or Stabbing Westward, then check this out.
B00005RIKD|5.0|&quot;All this time..&quot; reminds us why Sting is such a great artist. After the disappointing &quot;Brand New Day&quot; and &quot;Mercury Falling&quot; albums, this live album returns Sting to the higher echelons of popular music.  Its intimate jazz flavour is instantly appealing, as Sting swings through his greatest hits.  Almost all of the tracks are performance-perfect (with the exception of the usually haunting &quot;A Thousand Years&quot;)and most are superior to the studio versions.  Even the weaker songs from Sting's back-catalogue are rejuvenated in these new arrangements (even if &quot;Don't Stand So Close To Me&quot; is a little disturbing...) The new track, &quot;Dienda&quot; is one of Sting's better compositionns in recent years, and goes to show that Sting is at his best in the soft-jazz groove.  A final note: any album that features such delectable cello solos has to be a must. Here's hoping that any future Sting material will be in the same vein!
B00003CXZ1|3.0|LARA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER as just a movie is average but the DVD version is way better. Ok, first thing, TOMB RAIDER is based on the popular video game by the same name. Lara Croft is the character in the game. She's an adverturer who hunts and collects ancient artifacts. Now in the movie version Angelina Jolie plays Lara Croft and the plot centers around her finding a clock that can stop/alter time. That's the basic plot. I thought Angelina was perfect for this role. She even looked like Lara a bit. I thought the accent was too fake and at times you couldn't even understand what she was saying. The special effects in TOMB RAIDER were well done. There were a lot of cool scenes and great looking locations. The acting was average. But who cares? It's an action film! Now for the extras. I really suggest getting the DVD version 'cause the bonus features are great. It comes loaded with deleted scenes, interviews, how Angelina prepared for the role, how the special effects were created, and much more. It even includes a playable 3 level demo of TOMB RAIDER CHRONICALS! Plus U2's music video and more!
B00000063U|3.0|I am a long time fan of Richard Thompson, and rate him as a superb musician and songwriter. I was inspired to buy this CD based on the consistency of the reviews below, but on hearing the CD I was disappointed. There are no doubt some good tracks on here, but by and large I felt they were outweighed by the average ones. One track in particular, 'The Little Beggar Girl' I found to be distinctly repetitive. In summary make sure to listen to Richard Thompson if you haven't done so before, but I personally don't rate this as his best, and prefer 'Shoot out the lights'
0596000480|5.0|Unfortunately, there are more JavaScript books available than there are stars in the sky. For someone trying to learn JavaScript, I can only imagine the difficulty of trying to pick a good book. I've read several, sold several, thrown away several. You're luck finding a decent book would almost be as good as walking into a book store, closing your eyes, and pointing randomly. That is, EXCEPT for this book.<br />I cannot stress enough the QUANTITY of information contained in this book, nor can I stress the QUALITY of that information. The first section provides an understanding of the framework and fundamentals of JavaScript. This is a thorough explanation that will NOT leave you wanting like some &quot;Nutshell&quot; or &quot;Learn in 24 Hours&quot; book. The second section is an alphabetized list of every JavaScript element, and here's where the power of this book comes out: each element is defined including any browser limitations, all possible properties and functions of that object, and, in most cases, an actual working example. Yet, with all of this, my admiration for this comes in the last section: a detailed explanation of all the exceptions to the rules. You WILL NOT find this in any book, at least none that I've seen. More than once, my entire team was hung on something only to look in this book to find the problem described with an explanation of how to get around the limitation in the language. This alone is worth every penny, believe me.<br />If I could give this book more than five stars, I would. To this day, it remains *THE* most valuable book in my bookcase.
B00005U2LM|5.0|This album blows the last one away.  The last album was horrible.  But the Wu is back with Iron Flag, and this is a great album.  There are 12 songs, and every one of them is a banger.  Definitely check this out.  This could be a Wu classic.
B000002IOY|5.0|Overkill is one of, if not the greatest metal band ever assembled.  Combining Bobby Ellsworth's unique vocal stylings, Sid's extraordinarily riveting drum work, D.D.'s rich and powerful bass lines, and Bobby Gustafson whose technical guitar mastery rivals even the likes of Yngwie Malmsteen and Michael Angelo, helps create an unmistakable sound that is OverKill.  If you are prepared to step through the void of ordinary metal and into a higher state of metal consciousness then Years of Decay is the album to get.   <BR>  <BR>     Also, I am sick of hearing people complain about Bobby Ellsworth's voice/singing style.  Yeah, his singing is admittingly over the top... but think about it...  The band is called Overkill, a word synonymous with too much, over the top, or in excess of, so its supposed to be that way.  Unfortunately many people just don't get it.  Overkill is excessive guitar, overpowering drums and bass, and over the top vocals.  The band is too much... but that is the way its supposed to be!
B00005QDW1|2.0|1. Rock Steady (Intro)- Has those annoying x-mas bells sounds I can't stand!<br />2. Hella Good- It's an ok song. Not bad at all. I would not dance to it though.<br />3. Hey Baby- Great lyrics, and music. One of the best in the album.<br />4. Making Out- Too dancy. Too \\"pop\\". Hate it.<br />5. Underneath It All- The \\"Gem\\" of the album. The BEST song in the whole CD. Even that rapper Lady Saw sounds ok. Would have been better if she was not there, rapping, it gets annoying.....but all in all, \\"Underneath it all\\" is the best song in the CD.<br />6. Detective- Hate it.<br />7. Don't Let Me Down- Great song, with great lyrics. Love the guitar licks.<br />8. Start the Fire- I absolutely hate this song! Hate it hate it! It almost sounds like no doubt are stealing lyrics from The Doors \\"light my fire\\". The worst song in this CD. God Aweful.<br />9. Running- Oh my god, another song I hate. Those x-mas bells again. What is it with those x-mas bells! This is not a christmas albums. Sounds like x-mas bells computer sounds. I hate the song, lyrics and those special effects x-mas bells.<br />10. In My Head- Good lyrics, bad music. Could have been more of a \\"rock\\" song and add some drums and guitar.<br />11. Platinum Blonde Life- GREAT song, and Lyrics. Nice beat. It's actually a rock tune! Yay!<br />12. Waiting Room- Hate it. The beat annoys me. I thought this was No Doubt not Britney.....This sounds like something J-Lo or Britney might sing.<br />13. Rock Steady- Great lyrics and beat. BUT those stupid x-mas bells sounds appear in this song too!<br />What happened to No Doubt. Well...they are mostly gone. Now we have sell-outs.<br />God wonders what there next album might sound like! Disco?
B000002C2E|3.0|I'm puzzled at the large numbers of wildly enthusiastic reviews for this c.d. Yes it is a dark album, Dylan has never been afraid of adressing loss, betrayal, complex truths. But what is lacking here is beauty. Man in the Long Black Coat from Oh Mercy covers similar territory, yet the images in that song for example paint a much more vivid picture than anything presented here. The whole feel of the c.d. is more like a scribbled drawing rather than a painting. I try to imagine a stranger in a bar singing these songs and I don't think it would be very impressive. This is about as close to despair as I've ever heard him, dosn't sound like a good place to be.
B00005QDW1|3.0|Does the world really need any more candy rock?  I mean, aren't Britney Spears &amp; Christina enough to make us all sick?!  I'm a huge fan of Gwen &amp; I couldn't wait for this album to come out.  She's always been the get-out-of-my-way innocent bad girl, if you know what I mean.  It's a disappointment to see her becoming so mainstream.  The album has a great electronic pulse, but the lyrics are so one-dimensional.  Seriously, there are too many tracks on this album that have to do with a crush on some guy.  Come on Gwen, give us something to feast upon, make us think a little.  Leave the elementary school crush content to the ones who do it best...and should probably be there (Brit &amp; Chris).<BR>Overall, this album wasn't horrible, but it wasn't their best work either.  For all of you who wanted a kick-a** cd to pop in &amp; jam to, sorry.  For those of you who can only understand things if they're spelled out for you, well...here ya go.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|Ok so here is the run down. 5 college students go to a secluded cabin in the middle of spooky and smokey woods(are we getting a premonition yet?)While there, they come across the Necrinomicon Ex Mortis(The Book Of The Dead) and a tape recorder with incantations from the book on it. And, of course, They play the tape, release evil, become possesed, the whole 666 yards. I know  that you have seen a movie like that before, but you don't understand what makes the movie so great. the effects, while (not great), are simpley amazing. Decomposing zombies, (...) trees(cool), Lots of dismemberment. and, of course, Gallons upon gallons of everybody's favorite Plasmatic substence,BLOOD! Enough about the movie. Let's move on to the DVD itself. A steep little on the price, but well worth it. The 2 commentaries(one by director Sam Raimi, one by star and co-producer Bruce Campbell) are amazing! Raimi's is a good look on how the movie was made. Campbell's, on the other hand, is just funny!Now, don't be fooled. The \\"Behind-the-scenes\\" is nothing special. Just a bunch of cuts and inaudioble advice to the actors. No interviews, no funny outtakes, but still cool! This movie spawned two sequels. Both great. Not as scary, but good. Oh, to all the people who say evil dead 2 is a remake of the first one... WRONGWRONGWRONG!!! Watch the end of evil dead. Remember what happens? And how that happens at the BEGINNING of the second one? SEQUEL!! The first part of Dead by Dawn is Just a quick recap. Listen to the commentary. They said they had to reshoot the opening because they could not get the film from the film company for some reason. OK. That is the end of my rant. (...) so in summary, BUY THIS DVD!!! And if you are ever in a secluded cabin in the middle of the spooky and smokey woods, don't read any books, and DON'T PLAY ANY TAPE RECORDERS!!!! Later!!!!
0553565915|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely and I would recommend it for anyone who is interested to know that there is a good God beyond our skies. Betty Eadie is a remarkable woman who has shown us what to expect from a loving God.<br />I would also recommend another book that reveals the wonder that is God, &quot;Apocalypse Angel,&quot; by Charles Rivers.
0743424425|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite books of all time. I can't find a single thing about it that I don't like. It's well written, the characters take on a life of their own, and is creepy as Hell. The atmosphere Stephen King creates and the tension he builds is spectacular. The scares are powerful to the imaginative mind, and the characters are realistically tragic. I don't want to give anything away about the book (although with the amount of other reviews I doubt my silence hides anything), you should read it, if you haven't already. If you have, well, read it again.
0140186409|1.0|Pee, u.  This book has all the makings of a real crapper.  At first I thought it might be interesting but then came Grandpa Jode and the book went downhill ever since.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|For anyone who rates this album as messy, not up to his musical past.. they either have a closed mind or have been brain washed by the weak &quot;pop&quot; music of the past 5 years that has been played repeatedly over the radio.  The arrangements, musicianship, the tightness is uncomparable.  For those who say the lyrics or the message is too out there for them, sure maybe the deep voice can get you a little annoyed... at 1st... but after listen upon listen the music shines and the voice fits.  As for the message... it's just Prince doing what he has always done.  Look at songs like The Cross or albums like LoveSexy... he takes it a step further and deeper here on TRC.  He doesn't promote a single religion as the media would like you to think.  He sings about what he always has, loving GOD, being your own person and loving one another.  This album is not only musically superb, it is hope filling and inspiring.  Prince's best work in years and easily can be discussed as musically his best.
B00005NWM3|2.0|Nickelback's second album is a collection of generic hard rock songs.  The Canadian quartet is the 21st century version of such 70's acts like Kansas or Molly Hatchet, faceless bands who play faceless music.  The band's number one hit &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; is actually a good, catchy song with some stinging lyrics about a broken relationship.  Unfortunately, the rest of the album is one derivation after another of that theme that aren't quite as catchy as &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;.  Silver Side Up doesn't offer anything groundbreaking or original, but if you like hard rock music, then this album may be for you.
B00005U2LM|5.0|Wu Tang's last album was okay but this album can be described as one of it's best.Call it a classic for true Wu-tang Fans. Check tracks like &quot;UZI&quot;, &quot;Rule&quot; and &quot;Back in the Game&quot;.&quot;In the Hood&quot; is a good jump off for the album. Each Mcee is holding it down like they were going to lose their records deals.  The production is hot and shows similarity to 36 chambers with the samples of the Chinesse cinema and Iron Flag quotes. Production done by Rza,Mathematics, tone and Poke on track 10 and Trumaster. Wu defiantly have their Uzi back and is letting the world know on each track. One of the Year's best. Grab this one right now. I give it a 4.5. One
B00005QZWI|5.0|The soundtrack to the first installment of The Lord of The Rings trilogy perfectly captures the essence of the film.  Based in the mythical middle earth, the scenery is misty and smoky and Howard Shore's score plays off that imagery. Celtic sounding in style, the songs are intersperses with choral arrangements that provide a haunting sound.  New Age chanteuse Enya provides two songs to the soundtrack that are solid, but don't compare with the rest of this elegant collection.
B00005T5VE|5.0|Madonna has been known to release her work as specially packaged editions. I have this one and it's really nice. The cover is the same as the original, but inside, more pictures are included and the CD itself is a beautiful picture disc made to look like a phonograph record. The track listing is great, but it would have been much better if the songs were in chronological order. Because they aren't, this CD doesn't flow as easily as The Immaculate Collection. Madonna has been interviewd about this CD and she said that these are the songs she enjoys listening to, so it's not really a Greatest Hits album, it's a &quot;Madonna's Favorite Songs From The Last 10 Years&quot; album! All in all, this limited edition is a great collector's item, but if you're not a Madonna collector, the original is just as good and cheaper!
B00005RFAI|3.0|Pink's first album was made up of heavy r&amp;b songs that positioned her as a white girl who was down.  On her second album, Pink throws a curve ball, by mixing in heavy doses of rock and roll to her sound.  The first single from the album, &quot;Get This Party Started&quot;, is more in line with her first album and is a great, funky song that has a loose vibe.  &quot;18 Wheeler&quot; is a pretty strong rocker and &quot;Family Portrait&quot; is an intimate track with deeply personal lyric. Former 4 Non Blondes lead singer, Linda Perry is Pink's rock inspiration and that is part of the problem with the album.  Pink's strong lyrics are bogged down in the over the top sound that Ms. Perry favors.  Songs like &quot;Numb&quot;, &quot;My Vietnam&quot;, &quot;Dear Diary&quot; and &quot;Gone To California&quot; have alot of potential, but don't quite work.  Mizzundastood shows that Pink can be competent in several different styles and that she has the confidence to try different sounds, even when they don't always work out.  For that, she should be applauded.
B00003CXDD|4.0|This movie is not only part of my childhood, but it's also one of the very few well done fantasy movies.  For those of you who enjoy the Lord Of the Rings, until now this was the closest you could get to it in a live action movie.  A great part of nostalgia and a great movie on its own.
B00005JKES|4.0|...well that goes without saying.  i'm not even going to get into all the tv shows that owe a debt to twin peaks (x-files, picket fences, buffy the vampire slayer, northern exposure)...yea, the pilot is missing (has got to be something contractual) so i couldn't give the package five stars.  but the pilot IS available<br />on dvd as an import - check e-bay...anyway, i've started to delve into the special features and the whole set-up is pretty damn cool.  not to metion how crisp the picture and sound are compared to my ten year-old vhs tapes.  this is a MUST for any true twin peaks fan OR a newcomer.  just make sure to watch the pilot first,<br />just as miguel ferrer (albert rosenfeld) succinctly points out in<br />the extras...although i thought twin peaks was excellent (for the most part) its entire short-lived run, it really never got any better than these seven episodes...
B00003CXN4|4.0|The film, well, is okay, and probably relatively better than any other movie released in 2000.  For that 4 stars is fair I think.  Soderberg used a few big names, in large and cameo roles, to give the film star power so it can sell.  Those who went to see the film solely because of the &quot;stars&quot; deserved their so-called boredom.  Films, at least good films, transcend those who are in it.  It doesn't matter if Benicio Del Toro played the Latino cop or my next door neighbour Santos, just as long as the role is performed well.  In Benicio's case, the performance was adequate and effective, but not electrifying.  He supposed to be a bit reserved and cool in the role, and he did a good job of that.  The scene where the viewer gets a &quot;first person view&quot; of the young white girl getting &quot;rough treatment&quot; by a black man was excessive and pretty much digusting.  Which reflects her drug use, which is excessive and disgusting.  Politically incorrect?  If every time a black man is portrayed as violent and somebody gets a hernia over it, then we might as well not go to movies.  It fits the film and its bleak tone.  It doesn't have to be politically correct all the time.  Not every detail has to fit some liberal mode of thought.  If that was the case, then every studio would have a rep from the NAACP, Greenpeace, feminist groups, MAAD, the Vatician, gay and lesbian groups, and so on so as not to offend any certain view of group.  Then what would movies become, a vehicle for all of these groups to put their slant on things, limiting the creativity of the writers and directors.  I agree that films must meet a certain standard (langange, nudity, etc.) and should not directly offend any groups and races.  But a few details, surrounding a greater lesson, should not be nitpicked at.  Traffic ranks as a film of its time, not transcendent of it.  One would be remissed to recall it at the end of the decade, for it will most likely be overshadowed by more impactful films (by Soderberg among others).  But in a year of medicore films (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Gladiator), it was most probably one of the best just a notch below the coming-of-age Almost Famous.
B000059XVS|5.0|Combine one of the most fascinating figures in history along with the directing efforts of one of the unquestioned giants of twentieth century cinema and you have the winning combination that exemplifies the 1962 international blockbuster, &quot;Lawrence of Arabia.&quot;<br />T.E. Lawrence was an enigma to himself as well as those around him.  Too short to qualify for the British Army during World War One, Lawrence was given entry by special exemption.  Due to his passionate love for Middle East arcana, substantiated by archivist visits to the area, the erudite Lawrence was put in the Cairo Bureau office headed by General Edmund Allenby.  He proved an irritant and puzzle to the Sandhurst military types he confronted due to his uncanny ability to unearth the most minute details from maps as well as for his unconventionality, highlighted by an absence of military protocol.<br />A deal was ultimately struck in which Allenby, believing that perhaps Lawrence could aid the British cause in the field, assigned him to the Arabian dessert in what would be described as a freelance effort.  His superior officers in the Cairo Bureau were delighted since he made them feel awkward and they were happy to rid themselves of someone they considered a young upstart lacking the requisite mindset to be a good British soldier.<br />The rest is history as Lawrence was able to achieve unity by bringing together disparate tribal warriors who generally fought each other.  He filled them with incentive to rid themselves of the rule of Turkey's Ottoman Empire.  Those familiar with the hit and run tactics of the Viet Cong in the Vietnam War will see similarities in the way that Lawerence's warriors wait for the opportune moment, then strike when the better equipped, far more numerous Turkish forces are least aware.<br />The project of bringing Lawerence's fascinating life to the screen was a challenge of veteran British director David Lean, who also crafted &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; and &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;.  In the manner of &quot;Lawrence of Arabia,&quot; the other films were also magnificent technicolor dramas with broad international scope.  Screenwriter Robert Bolt crafted his superb script from Lawrence's autobiography, &quot;The Seven Pillars of Wisdom.&quot;  I found Lawrence fascinating enough to concentrate a lengthy chapter on him in my Middle East historical work, &quot;Struggle for the Holy Land.&quot;  Lawrence is brilliantly captured on screen by Peter O'Toole,who vaulted to international stardom with this role.  The film won 7 Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Cinematography.<br />William Hare
020530902X|5.0|Twenty-one years ago, a professor in one of my English Lit. classes brought out a book that was NOT one of those texts that you thought you were going to have to take along into the next life in order to finish it. The book was quite the opposite. It was a small 78 page publication that was no more intimidating than a comic book. <br />I was a student that needed help in my punctuation, word usage, and style. I hoped, as did all the students, that the day would come when we would be published. The professor said, &quot;If you're ever going to make it in the writing field, this book will be your best guide. Stick to the principles mentioned in its pages and you will achieve your goals. That is, assuming you have any writing ability in you at all.&quot; <br />Currently, I am taking a refresher course through a correspondence school back East. Guess what book is part of their curriculum? You're right, it's The Elements of Style. This time I have given the book a strict credence, and in the next few months I will have my first publishing credit.<br />I believe, The Elements of Style, is still the best book on correct writing techniques there is on the market. It was so tweny-one years ago and it will be so twenty-one years from now.<br />M.D. Cummings
B00005QDW5|4.0|Over all, the songs here are nicely mastered, but I agree with other Pink Floyd Fans, either they should have added a 3rd CD or made better choices with what they had. Echoes was always my favorite Floyd masterpiece, chopping it 7 minutes was definatley a mistake. I will be spending an additional $30.00 now on the Master recording of Meddle to hear Echoes as I enjoyed it for the last 30 years.
B00005B6C9|4.0|Over the past four years,the Bee Gees would record and release two albums.They were the studio album Still Waters and the live album One Night Only.For the next few years,the brothers would be busy writing songs for the next album.During this time,we were all very patient as we awaited what the brothers had in store for us.<br />When 2001 began,we heard that there was a new Bee Gees album on the way.We all probably wondered &quot;Was The Wait Well Worth It?&quot;

B000050XEI|4.0|The number of reviews alone should indicate the impact this long awaited album has had on people. First of all some of the criticism is accurate, in that the album is very short and that some of the songs do sound very similar to past tunes and styles.<br />But what lifts it are 2 truly outstanding songs : &quot;Wild Child&quot; and &quot;Only Time&quot;. The first is simply exhilarating , the music , lyrics and Enya's lovely voice blend seamlessly like colours of the rainbow, its impossible to separate the 3 into separate components. Another interesting feature is that you only appreciate the harmony if you set your CD volume at the right level : too soft and you miss some of the rich tones , too loud and the voice begins to sound dissonant and dominate over the other two components. I have noticed the same feature in some of Bach's piano sonatas. I guess this shows that what seems like effortless joy hides a great deal of structural complexity. Astonishing as it seems , I think Enya has yet to reach her peak as a creative artist. Some of the reviews suggest she is just recycling old tunes and randomly mixing them up like a Boy Band, but the ability to produce something like &quot;Wild Child&quot; shows how wrong they are in writing her off.<br />The second outstanding song &quot;Only Time&quot; is as melancholy as &quot;Wild Child&quot; is refreshing. And yet Enya's voice sounds the same in both , showing that she is able to control her vocal range at a very subtle level.<br />The rest of the album has some tunes you will find yourself unconsciously humming the more you listen to the album. There are also songs like &quot;Deora Ar Mo Chrol&quot; where one does not care what the words mean, you are just overwhelmed by the delicate beauty of her voice.<br />To summarise , its much easier to criticize than it is to create. When you compare this album against the monotonous, ubiquitous trash produced by MTV &quot;artists&quot; it stands out as something rare and fine.The famous fantasy writer Stephen J Donaldson coined the memorable phrase &quot;Something there be in beauty&quot; in one of his most famous books. The same could be said of Enya's composing style. <br />I once read in one of her rare interviews that she spends much of her time in silence in cathedrals as she loves the atmosphere. Perhaps the long time she spends composing and perfecting her work is her way of giving back a little of<BR>what she has so evidently received.<br />I look forward to her next effort, and feel blessed to have listened to A Day Without Rain, parts of which I'll treasure forever.
B000001FAW|4.0|When the Bee Gees signed to the newly formed RSO records in 1973,they began a whole new era in their career.The brothers looked at this as a way to regain their status in the U.S.A and also to broaden their own artistic horizons.The only problem was that the new era was getting off to a very slow start.Their first RSO album,Life In A Tin Can(see review)was a disappointing seller.After an album that was rejected by both RSO and Atlantic,a replacement album entitled Mr.Natural(see review)was their weakest selling album.A year later,they rebounded with Main Course(see review)and they were once again on their way.In 1976,the new era was getting revamped.Stigwood had switched RSO distrubution with Polydor worldwide.To the Bee Gees,it was like a breath of fresh air.They were already at work on their next album.To hype it,a single entitled You Should Be Dancing would be released in June of 1976.It quickly became their third #1 single and their fourth stateside gold single.Children Of The World would be released two months later.It would quickly climb to #8 in the U.S.A. and would be the first Bee Gees album to be certified platinum by the RIAA(Recording Industry Association of America).<br />One listen to Children Of The World and you'll know why it was so successful.This album is chock full of great sounding R&amp;B/Soul songs.While not as polished as Main Course,it still sounds superb.The brothers would also return to producing themselves.<br />This album features some of their finest songwriting and vocal moments.You Should Be Dancing encoursges people to getb on the dance floor and start dancing the night away.It also features Barry's best falsetto at the time.Love So Right(a #3 single and fifth to go gold)describes the difference between love and infatuation.It also features Barry attempting a Marvin Gaye styled falsetto(Marvin Gaye probably influenced this song.This is the type of song he would write and sing).You Stepped Into My Life(the B-Side of Love So Right anda turntable hit in its own right)is about a man showing how thankful he is for the woman in his life.Boogie Child(A #12 single)is about a lady who loves to be on the dance floor and the man who wants her to be one and only.It also features an extreme rarity,a lead vocal by Maurice with Barry and Robin singing in the background.Lovers(the B-Side of Boogie Child)is about a man telling a lady what they'll be when they get together and it's also a great Barry and Robin duet.Love Me(a song that Yvonne Elliman would later record)is about a man yearning to be loved and is another great Barry and Robin duet.Subway(the B-Side of You Should Be Dancing)is about a man who wants to take the subway home and also hightlights Barry's falsetto.Can't Keep A Good Man Down is about the one thing that keeps a man up and running,a good woman.It would also become part of their live staple as well as another turntable hit(it would also become the B-Side of How Deep Is Your Love? a year later).The title track exemplifies what we all are.All these songs,including the closing ballad The Way It Was,further demonstrate the fine songwriting and vocal talents of these three brothers.<br />Musicaaly,Barry plays some of his best guitar.Maurice also contributes some great bass work.Along for the ride is Stephen Stills who contributes additional percussion on You Should Be Dancing.Gary Brown plays KILLER sax on Boogie Child.George Perry plays additional bass on Subway and The Way It Was.Altogether,the brothers alongside Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson produce an infectious and funky R&amp;B/Soul album.<br />So Bee Gees fans everywhere,you must have Children of The World in your CD library.Once you have it,you can enjoy it as much as you want to.Get it now and start dancing the night away.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I thought this album was stupendous.  It shows Britney has evolved from a girl to a mature women.  The songs are very meaningful.  Like, &quot;overprotected&quot; it shows independence and &quot;let me be&quot; to me shows growing up.  I think she has an astounding voice and a great career ahead of her.  I can't wait until her next album.  All the songs have a special message.  Don't miss out get this record right away.
B00005BJMQ|5.0|Well, what can be said?  Ummm...  It's excellent?  Stunning?  Heartrending?  Yup.  All of them.  If you've seen the movie then you know what I'm babbling about. ... <br />...I'll tell you about the music.  The first song is \\"Lady Marmalade.\\"  I hate this song.  It ruins the CD.  There are SO many better things to listen to.  Next is \\"Diamond Dogs\\" done by Beck.  It's nice and suitably poppy.  \\"Children of the Revolution\\" is one I could do without most of the time, but sometimes I feel like acting goofy and I listen to it.  \\"Nature Boy\\" is sung by David Bowie.  Wow.  It is SO pretty and it fits the story PERFECTLY!  One of the lyrics is the main grab line for the movie, \\"The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.\\"  The next song is \\"Le Tango de Roxanne\\".  It is SUPERB!  The song is filled with passion, pain, anger, and hurt.  Ewan McGregor's voice on this track is EXCELLENT.  \\"Because We Can\\" is a goofy little medley made for dancing and capering around your room when you're alone.  \\"Sparkling Diamonds\\" is deep and sultry.  \\"One Day I'll Fly Away\\" is Nicole Kidman's most stunning song on the CD next to \\"Hindi Sad Diamonds.\\"  \\"Rhythm of the Night\\" is also made for capering.  \\"Hindi Sad Diamonds\\" will be liked by anyone that liked Sting's Desert Rose.  It is very much alike to that song - what with combining a bit of traditional with Hindi music.  Very cool.  The next is \\"Your Song\\" originally done by Elton John and redone by Ewan McGregor.  This song is so earnest and heartfelt.  \\"Elephant Love Medley\\" is my second favorite on this CD.  It combines so many songs together.  The first time I heard it, I had a good bit of fun trying to figure out what songs they had used.  \\"Come What May\\" is the biggest hit to the CD.  This is a song to play at wedding receptions.  I actually think that I will.  LOL.  Anyways, the last song is \\"Complainte de la Butte.\\"  This is a song that is in French and it is very beautiful.  It is nice and mellow andit puts me to sleep when I'm having trouble falling asleep.  It's very much like a lullaby.<br />...I hope that you buy this CD and that you love it as much as I do.<br />...
B0000025LS|4.0|Let's see, Santana 1, Abraxis, one or two more, Caravansari - Neal Schone and Rollie depart and form Journey (the good Journey before Steve Perry shows up).  Carlos and Johnny Mac from Mahavisunu collaborate for an awesome album (which the record moguls never felt comfortable with)...  Disco...  Metal and Zebop!  Santana is back... Zebop was back then what smooth is today... only the fan base today is larger and the capital gains are phenomenal...  Zebop launched the new Santana, pop like yet cool - great hooks, solid lead work, heavy rhythm section and hard working percussion.  It had it all and what's more it resurrected Santana's Marque to the masses.  Great stuff!  Why 4 stars and not 5?  Five stars belong to those who bring in a major shift in genre.
0060934913|5.0|This is not the type of book that I usually read ... I'm not a &quot;foodie&quot; or whatever they are called. But I had read his &quot;New York Times&quot; article and I was intrigued.<br />WOW! I could NOT put this book down! Mr. Bourdain is an excellent writer whose startling and evocative sentences are surely as delicious as his striped bass in butter.<br />People who get offended easily should avoid this book, because it's not for uptight prudes (aka the &quot;well-done crowd&quot;).<br />Mr. Bourdain tells it like it is, and reading this book is like eating a stolen twelve-course dinner of fresh and spicy delights.
B00003CXRM|5.0|For a while I stared at the Box at my local video rental trying to figure out what kind of movie this would be.  I had not heard of the movie, I had seen no reviews.  Day after day I considered it, but passed it by.  Then a friend at work mentioned that he was looking forward to renting it for the third time, for a relaxing weekend.  He was in love with the &quot;Old-Timey&quot; music.  When my parents were here for Thanksgiving, I was looking for a movie that would appeal to them, and I remembered the recommendation.  What a hoot!  We were sitting there watching it over and over, and everyone in my family from age 14 to 74 enjoyed it.  My only complaint is the over use of mild profanity, mainly taking the Lord's name in vain.  They should have left that out.  Otherwise, it was the wierdest, nuttiest, funniest, most touching, and yet suspenseful movie I have seen in a long time.  Must see (and hear).  I bought the sound track right away.

0553812173|5.0|I have to say I like epics based round empire building and political intrigue where the distinction between villian and hero can be at times blurred. A brutal example of the former and the latter is how I would describe Steven Erikson's first novel. I also liked the fact that for most of the characters he only gave sketches of who they are relying on their actions to reveal their motivations and to give insights into them as people. It's not original but then very little is in todays fantasy genre. I mentioned in the title of my review that the book reminded me of Glen Cook and it does. The comparison between the Black company and it's accompanying wizards and on going battles with very  powerful sorcerers and gods can't be missed. As well as it's leaders Croaker and Whiskeyjack. Nonetheless it is a well written book with excellent pieces of sparodic action and an interesting system of magic. If you are a fan of Eddings this book won't suit you and if you are a fan of Wheel of time fan it might not be your cup of tea as well. The female characters within are much tougher certainly more intelligent. They are preoccupied with the bussiness of war and sorcery as opposed to discussing their boyfriends. Ooops hope that didn't sound as too derogatory? Ah what the hell yes I did!<br />I'm looking forward to his new book!
0451204530|3.0|I gave CODE TO ZERO 3 stars, because it sucked me in. The plot starts out great. Guy loses his memory, and he must find out who he is. I found myself intrigued with what was actually happening in the story. But, a lousy and predictable ending cost FOLLETT two stars.  Where's the drama? The Twist? Nothing! Straight as a board.
B00005AAFS|5.0|You might have expected anything from the German guys but the unbelievable power of their Dance-metal that crashes the walls, making their fans to sing along every line of the lyrics, and that make us all believe in the future of the modern nu-metal.<br />Everything is very special about their music and themselves: a theatrical or rock-opera-like approach to vocals that at the same time sound very heavy rock-like, the fast, rhythmic, and extremely heavy guitar riffs mixed with a general industrial sound, perfect lyrics, and, of course, the incredible live show Rammstein manage to perform every time they are on the stage.<br />The whole list of the tracks from Mutter is a collection of equal quality hits, and though you might have liked more Ich will, or Sonne, or Links due to having all of them on radio or MTV every hour, no other song would be a disappointment, you'll easily like most of the material.<br />The tracks like Mein Herz brennt, Feuer frei!, Zwitter, Rein raus, und Adios may probably impress you even more - with their energy, their lyrics, and the talent of their creators that is coming out with every sound.<br />The whole separate chapter is Mutter, a very rare case of succesful mixture of nu-metal and old hard rock traditions, one of their best songs ever. Nebel is not far behind, and really adds to the cd.<br />Forget your problems with German (or just get the dictionary), buy the cd, and enjoy the most original music of the recent times.
B00004Z459|1.0|I think it's embarrasing that people who like this band promote it as &quot;metal.&quot; Machine Head (old), Napalm Death, Pantera, Pro-Pain, and Tool are examples of metal. By now plenty of other groups have copied them, and it's probably very likely that fans of this group have never even heard of them!<br />What annoys me the most about this band (among other alter-naive &quot;rap rockers&quot;) is despite all the &quot;angst-ridden&quot; and &quot;gloomy&quot; songs, they thank their family and friends in a memo on the album sleeve. Surely they had no family, friendship, or relationship problems to cry about,so,what's all the fuss?All these modern &quot;rap-rock&quot; groups do is profit off the maudlin emotions of teenagers. If you want reassurance of that, check to see where a band is from. Riverside, CA, is pretty affluent, isn't it? If I were still a kid I would prefer to grow up there over Watts, CA, Southside Chicago, or Spanish Harlem. But you get the drift. This will publicize the truth of any band that fashions itself as a pathetic crybaby.<br /> It shouldn't be long until these 5 guys sell you chili-fries at a drive-through window, while another group of college-age kids (living in a well-to-do upper-class suburb) plan another rap-rock scam to fool the masses - in their neighbor's garage.
B00005QIPH|2.0|Yes, we've all been hearing about them for the last 7 months. We've all succumb to the hype in some shape or form.<BR>Some of us have even fell into the brainwashing the Strokes are the saviours of rock, the next Beatles, the ultimate song smiths.<br />What they are in reality are 5 trust fund kids from NYC whom through spending more money than any punk rock band ever sees in a lifetime on PR. They had inside people in every publication from Rolling Stone to Time Out NY. Having your friends work in the press is one thing, but how about having a mogul dad whom is one of the titans of the fashion world? Or a father whom made a living off the record industry in the 70's. <br />The Strokes were basically handed their deal on a platter. They press gave you all the necessary gossip to get the machine in motion. <br />Sure the Velvet Underground & Television get mentioned in every sentence. What the press don't mention is that the songwriter in the band was actually influenced by Pearl Jam & Jim Morrison. <br />I can go on forever, bottom line is The Strokes aren't all their cracked up to be. There's a couple of OK songs on \\"Is This It\\". But that's it, their OK. I'd be surprised if this band can even top their debut. <br />\\"Last Nite\\" is the strongest track, listen to the tracks before you buy it.<BR>If you could find this CD in the used bin it might be worth the ($$).
B00005A46T|2.0|Folks, Slipknot's music is nothing fresh. Listen to Sepultura's &quot;Roots&quot; in the middle of both Slipknot albums...you'll seriously think it was all the same band. The singer's voice, the sampling, the percussionists, guitars, bass, etc., totally the same. &quot;Roots&quot; had much better production, so if you like groove-oriented metal, get that.<br /> Probably the best song on here is &quot;Gently&quot;. Unfortunately, it's not original, either. It sounds remarkably similar to &quot;Exhale the Vile&quot; by Machine Head.
0064430227|5.0|that makes him timeless!  I remember reading this a few years ago when I was in kindergarden and was thrilled to find it again to share with my elementary aged children, they love Harold too!  In a very simple, imaginiative way, Harold will creep into your heart and live on your bookshelf as a prized possession!
B00005B36H|5.0|All those lame hip-hop rock wusses got you down? Have no fear, the whackos from Tool are here, and here to stay!<br /> Make no mistake, you won't find any rapping, guest appearances, simple 3-string guitar riffs, or mindless singing about angst on &quot;Lateralus&quot;. Although Tool has unfortunately been copied from other bands over the years, there are several trademarks which make them completely distinguishable: for one, Tool songs are longer, MJ Keenan's voice is stylishly temperamental, and often the band experiments with various instruments and sounds in the vein of 70s art rock. Not all songs have singing (some just extended, experimental instrumentation) which is what makes the band quite unique while other groups make an album for a one hit wonder and filler.<br /> The Grudge, The Patient, Schism, Triad, and Ticks and Leeches are probably the best songs the band has done, perhaps topping &quot;Stinkfist&quot; on Aenima and &quot;Sober&quot; on Undertow. The extended wait for this latest album proved to be no disappointment. Recommended highly for anyone who loves music.
B00005QZWI|4.0|I am a long time Lord of the Rings fan, and I have been waiting for these movies, and this soundtrack for quite some time.  This soundtrack shocked me at first, as I was not expecting such dark overtones to most of the score.  The chorals were well done, and the a good deal of the music was fairly original.  Durring the song &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot;, I could just picture a little hobbit, in his chair, blowing smoke rings in mid afternoon.  To anyone who enjoys a good, energetic, and even exciting score, this is a MUST have.  Very strong score, from a very good composer... but again, it is not the best out there.
B00005BL2A|5.0|Since the album &quot;Some Great Reward,&quot; when Martin Gore took over the songwriting, every DM album has had a theme that expresses the band's feelings and experiences of that time.  Exciter seems to be influenced by their hunger for peace, beauty, and ambience in a chaotic life.  <br />The music matches the lyrical tone, very lush and hypnotic, focusing less on electronic wizardry and more on experimentation with acoustic instruments, although their electronic roots are not forgotten.  &quot;Dream On,&quot; is the best example of this, mixing a simple guitair riff with sizzling synth beats overlapping.  The more ambient tracks are &quot;Shine,&quot; &quot;Freelove&quot; (my personal fav), and &quot;The Sweetest Condition.&quot;  The more adrenaline pumping tracks are &quot;I Feel Love,&quot; and &quot;Dead of Night.&quot;  The only weak track on the album is &quot;Breathe,&quot; only because the lyrics seem to be somewhat lacking and hokey.<br />I would consider this album to be a cross between Violator and Ultra.  But this is definetly a strong and unique album by itself.  Martin, Dave, and Fletch are continuing to grow and evolve through their music, making this album a classic.
630289915X|5.0|I LOVE this movie! It is my favorite and there is simply no point in telling the story since I don't think there is one single person on the planet that hasn't seen it at least once. From beginning to end, this is the greatest movie ever made. Why? For the simple way it sends a powerful and important message. It has the message that we all must appreciate life in all its richness and fullness, with all the struggles and triumphs, with all the sadness and joy, life is always worth living for the love we give and the love we receive. Every time I see this movie it always reminds me that no matter what struggles I may be facing in my life, I should always think myself lucky and be thankful for the things I do have, the love of my family and friends which make me feel rich indeed. <br />This movie has it all, a talented cast, memorable scenes, great lines and a wonderful story. From beginning to end, this movie is sure to move you to laughter, it will make you think and it is guarantee to make you shed tears of sadness and at the end, tears of joy. <br />Don't just watch the televised version, get this on video to enjoy as many times as you want (without those annoying commercial interruptions) during the holiday season or at any other time of the year.
B00005JKHP|5.0|Star Trek: The Motion Picture I have to admit was a good film  but it really took things too slowly, slow devloping plot, slow developing characters, and more dialouge bore. There was some good things about it had a good story, great SFX (they would use better ones in later films), and solid acting. I have the T.V. version which runs a 143mins which great but still was slow. So now Paramount has released a 2 disc edition  which i got on my birthday and also i got a 60watt Subwoofer. So after i got all that plugged I got ready to pop open the case and stick the DVD in. I was quite amazed of how it was done the picture was good but could better. The 5.1 Surround was really marvelous its been remixed and sounds different. I enjoyed the commentaries Robert Wise was very informal about that movie. I was surprised that i heard it never got a test screening because they were still trying to finish the film so they barely made it and I understand how much work they had to go through because they didn't get the visual effects they wanted and now thanks to Paramount we get to see them. The new effects shot are quite excellent my favorite is the wormhole and the new exterior shot of V'ger's ship and also exploding at the end. I think new effects really do help out because they add to the atmosphere of the movie and helped out some of the scenes that didn't quite made sense. Overall its a good Director's Edition movie and Excellent DVD. Below is the ratings of both the movie and DVD<br />Movie Ratings:<BR>1979 Version: *** of *****<BR>1983 T.V.

B00000K19E|5.0|This by far is one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood in a very long time. I love it! When it was in theatres my sister and I went to see it, not once, not twice but Four Times! When it was released on video and DVD we knew we had to get it, and believe it or not, we got it on both formats. (We have DVD on our home computer but since the screen is small we also wanted a version we could watch on our large screen T.V. Oh well!) We are definitely hooked on the Matrix. It is action packed and it has a story that leaves you scratching your head and wondering \\"What if?\\" long after you see the film. Keanu Reeves was made for the Matrix or perhaps the Matrix was made for Keanu, whatever, the point is that he is perfect in his role as the reluctant hero Neo. Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity is the perfect female role model, she's beautiful, she's feminine, she knows how to take command of a situation and she kicks major you-know-what. The more times I see this movie, the more I grow to love it and the more questions I have. The Wachowski brothers have outdone themselves with this gem of a film and I can hardly wait for parts 2 and 3 to come out in theaters.<br />If you don't own a DVD then you must run out and get one. Although it is OK to see it on video, the DVD version has so much more to offer and the special effects were meant to be seen on a digital format. My only problem, I wish I had a DVD for my T.V.
0930289234|4.0|It is well accepted in the comic industry that Alan Moore's Watchmen, along with Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns, revitalized the comic industry in the early 1980s, turning it from a medium largely exploited for children into a more &quot;adult&quot; sort of way to tell a story.  Although the Japanese have been producing mature stories for years using both comics and animation, Americans are just catching on, but it's great to return to books like Watchmen to see how the entire movement developed here.  Moore has done quite a bit of work in the comic industry, but Watchmen seems to be the piece he's most well-known for.<br />What Moore presents is a story where super-heroes are nothing more than human beings.  With the exception of nuclear accident Dr. Manhattan, every &quot;super-hero&quot; is only a masked vigilante, and society has long since turned their backs on these &quot;uncivilized&quot; crime fighters.  Little more than a fad in the 1950s, super-heros have become a footnote, and now it seems as if someone's out to either kill them or put them in prison for good.  Giving away much more of the story would be doing Mr. Moore's perfectly-paced writing a grave disservice, but the struggle to discover the &quot;villian&quot; takes place against a Reagan-esque background of the threat of nuclear war as the Soviets invade Afghanistan, lending a sense of both urgency and historical siginificance to the work in general.<br />What matters here isn't so much the story, although it's interesting to read on its own, but the character profiles.  Watchmen, which refers to the old Latin saying &quot;Quis custodiet ipsos custodes&quot; - &quot;Who watches the watchmen,&quot;  is a study of what would possess a person to actually don a costume of, say, a giant owl, or a mini-skirt and scoop-top, and go out and fight &quot;evil.&quot;  What is evil?  Is the &quot;hero&quot; who destroys a family and ruins a child's image of his mother any better than the mother herself?  Can rape be excused if the rapist has saved thousands of other people's lives?  At what point does vegeance and morality clash, or coincide?  How sane are these people?  And, most importantly, who is watching them - who's making sure they act in the best interests of the people they are supposed to protect?<br />These are never easy questions, and Moore doesn't resort to easy answers - except once, and that is the single flaw in an otherwise perfect stained-glass window.  I won't give specifics, but let's just say that Dr. Manhattan's final answer to his Mars question is a real disappointment, especially considering the quality of the rest of the book.  I wouldn't let it ruin my good time, though.<br />Watchmen is a great work of art.  To call it a comic lessens its impact.  To call it a book is a mistake.  It's simply Watchmen, and it's worth owning.  Moore is a master writer, and reading his work is as delicious as Nabokov or Sherman Alexie.  It's not to be missed, even if it isn't perfect.?

0385505833|1.0|I agree with all the other one or two star reviews of this &quot;Holiday&quot; story. Mr. Grisham should donate his profits (including my few dollars) to the Salvation Army. Many things were irritating about this book. One of the things that stood out to me was the fact that main characters were running to a tanning booth before their cruise - but on the other hand the father was afraid that his daughter's Peruvian boyfriend was dark skinned. It was OK that he was a doctor! What garbage! Don't buy it.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I'll try to keep this somewhat brief. I would actually give this 4 and a half stars. Why? It's about time that a &quot;pop&quot; artist is actually able to play an instrument (at all, let alone as well as Mayer)! Ok, I am somewhat of a music snob. Being a musician/songwriter I am nauseated by most of what the radio and MTV have to offer. Mayer seems to have successfully mastered the art of writing music that is &quot;poppy&quot; enough for the radio and mainstreamers, but actually has intelligent lyrics and some genuine musicianship. Not only is Mayer's guitar playing great on this album, but he has found ways of changing the tunes up so as not to fall into the &quot;G,C,D&quot; chord progressions of most pop songs. And as for the &quot;Dave Matthews wannabe&quot; vocals (to quote Mr. Wright), he does have a Dave element to his voice (&quot;Why Georgia&quot;), and it works well with his music. But other songs like the chorus of &quot;Neon,&quot; are reminiscent of Peter Gabriel. Besides, look at Nickelback and all the other carbon-copy Creed type bands, not to mention Blink 182 and the 50 million punker groups. (Hmmm, so much for brief. . .) For my money, John Mayer beats the tar out of them and all the dime-a-dozen assembly-line songs the boy bands and others sing, of which the writers are sitting back and laughing that people are actually paying money for a song that took them 10 minutes to put together. Lyrically, Mayer's work is very good. &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; is a well-written song where, in the first line of the second verse, Mayer cleverly makes a play on the words of the chorus. It's not Shakespeare, but this is his first effort. Like ANYTHING on the radio these days comes close to having any intellectual depth. . . &quot;I'm comin' out so you better get this party started...&quot; WOW, those are some DEEP lyrics, Pink.
B00005RHGK|1.0|THIS MOVIE JUST PLAIN OLD (...). I could have gotten better entertainment from Sorority Babes at the Slimeball Bowl-A-Rama!<BR>The only thing appealing is the sister is HOT! WHY DOES THIS CREATURE WHISTLE? The plot was original, I'll give them that. But they should have kept this movie in its original form...... an idea in someones head!
B00003CXTG|1.0|I wish to God I could have that two and a half hours of my life back.  If you do decide to rent this piece of... get the DVD.  At least you can enjoy the extra features and the ease of skipping ahead to the cool war scenes.  The rest of the movie is a bunch of generation X'ers running aroud pretending they know what its like to live in the forties.  Chick flick to the max my friends!!!
B00005QDW1|4.0|Yes, it's true, Rock Steady is a lot different than Tragic Kingdom, but it's not a bad album by any means. &quot;Hey Baby&quot; is actually better as a video, so get it if you can. &quot;Making Out&quot; and &quot;Hella Good&quot; are also good. <br />Oh, and if you download one of these songs from the 'net and find that it's just a chorus looped over and over...that's not the real song. Duh.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is a powerful science fiction novel that takes place in the future, when two alien invasionshave previously occured.  Ender is a military genius bred to save the world from the aliens.  He is shipped off to Battle School, a remote place set in space.  At battle school, Ender must struggle to deal with his special gift, as the adults are pushing him to his limits physically and emotionally.  He must prove himself, and on the way he must also grow up.  He must struggle with the choice society has chosen for him.<BR>      Although science fiction isn't particularly my favorite genre,  Ender's Game is still a book i love.  Orson Scott Card is able to create images in the imagination that are unbelievable.  The characters' personalities are all so interesting that one feels like they know them personally.  I recommend this book to everyone that is looking for a real page-turner.
B00005QDW1|4.0|Yes, it's true, Rock Steady is a lot different than Tragic Kingdom, but it's not a bad album by any means. &quot;Hey Baby&quot; is actually better as a video, so get it if you can. &quot;Making Out&quot; and &quot;Hella Good&quot; are also good. <br />As for why it's so unlike earlier albums...well, it's hard to write punk songs when everything's going well. And life has been good to No Doubt as of late. <br />Oh, and if you download one of these songs from the 'net and find that it's just a chorus looped over and over...that's not the real song. Duh.
B00003CY0V|5.0|Let me reaffirm what another reviewer said: Don't the so-called professional critics scare you off this movie IF you like lots of action, sex ..., adventure, a few plot turns and more than a few explosions.  If that is your bag, though, Swordfish is certainly a movie worth checking out. <br />The plot is startlingly simple, but takes a while to get developed.  Travolta is fine as a smooth, in-control antiterrorist agent.  He somehow has Halle Berry (Lord have mercy, she is fine!) Help him recruit the greatest computer hacker in the known world.  Their scheme is to transfer a cool ten million bucks which found its way into secret government accounts to Travolta's own end.<br />...I found the climax and the plot turns to be satisfying and it certainly was not my \\"passive attention which was held.  And I don't care if the computer scenes were somehowy \\"unrealistic\\", because I was still wowed by the opening scene at the bank with the hostage-turned-into-a-claymore-mine.<br />This is a movie that is certainly entertaining.  If I need to be more intellectually challenged, I will read some Einstein.
B00005JKES|5.0|First off, for all the people who complained that the pilot was not included, it's a shame, but while the television series is owned by Artisan Entertainment, the pilot is owned by another company.  Given the circumstance, this is without a doubt one of the best DVD collections released to date. Technically superior, the bit rate is on average 9, as opposed to the superbit collection which tops out at 8, and regular dvd's, which are in the 6-7 range.  From what I understand, this is one of the best looking transfers ever. <br />As for the actual content, well, neither me nor my roomate had ever seen Twin Peaks before, being too young when the show was on, and even without the pilot, we sat rapt throughout the seven episodes on this disc.  We couldn't stop watching them, and ended up doing the whole set in one night.  This is great, great stuff, which has obviously had serious influence on other shows that followed it.<br />In closing, if you like Twin Peaks, or David Lynch, or great television that really makes you think, then buy this set. This is the only way that Artisan will release the following seasons, and possibly acquire the rights to the pilot to release it as well.
B00005B36H|5.0|This album is pure genius.  The music is so beautiful and perfectly written.  Only Tool can have music so original, so far out, so intelligently written, and still be filled with beuaty.  I have seen Tool in concert 5 times, traveling over 8 hours for one concert.  I have all their cd's, videos, all related muscal acts (Peach, APC, etc.).  I would have to say this is definitly their best album yet, and the best album of the last 10 years at least.  It strikes a place in my soul listening to the music, and I hope that they have more to come.
B00000K19E|5.0|What can I say. Even Keanu Reeves is good in this one. Carie Ann is the bomb. I love this girl, she should have been laura Croft! What were they thinking. If you dont like this movie you must be dead.
0448060191|4.0|I read this book when I was 10 and on a vacation, and for my lil brain at that age it was great, but now it's just a little too simple that the children always try to do the right thing no matter what, always do as their mother tells them to, and always end up learning something wonderful. For the young reader, read it! If you're older and you want to read a children's story, read it! but if you want to read a book that seems realistic, don't
B000031WD9|4.0|Four high school friends (Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas & Eddie Kaye Thomas) near finishing their years thought school. Four friends make the ulimate pact to lose their virginity by Prom Night. But the four expierence their teenage years, some good unexpected things will change their lives.<br />Directed by Paul Weitz (Down to Earth, About a Boy) made a clever funny comedy about grown-up and coming of age to being a adult. DVD's has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer & an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. An entertaining commentary track by Director:Paul Weitz, Writer:Adam Herz & Cast Members:Thomas, Biggs and Seann William Scott. The best thing about the film is the Cast makes this one appealing (Including Eugene Levy as Biggs's Father) . One of the few good surprises of 1999. Casey Affleck appears Unbilled. Written by Adam Herz (American Pie 2, Ameican Wedding). Grade:A-.
6305364613|1.0|This rendition of Romeo and Juliet begins with a fight at a gas station.  The house warriors have been made into punks with trench coats and magnums. Each one of these running and jumping characters is freeze framed and kindly introduced to us with big white letters.  Naturally, the gas station explodes.  Even the combat scenes in this movie are boring and I would favor the sword fighting in Zeffirelli's classic any day.<br />The cinematography is overstylized and self absorbed.  Much of the film is shot in dead sepia tones; watching it is like drowning in stale beer.  There are also many garish light effects and glib camera tricks that make it look like a trashy music video.  Bring out the disco ball!<br />The acting is unforgivable.  Leonardo DiCaprio speaks Shakesperian blandly, as though he were ordering pizza.  When his performance isn't lacking in passion, he overdramatizes.  When he shoots Tybalt, he screams for about a minute.  When he comes to the line &quot;I defy you stars&quot; he screams for about a minute.  <BR>Clare Danes is like a sexy trick-or-treater in her little angel outfit as she, like DiCaprio fumbles through the script.<BR>Perhaps most lamentably, clever Mercutio is somehow transformed into a mindless transvestite that shouts a lot.<br />This most recent version of Romeo and Juliet falls only scarcely short of a deliberate attempt to defame a great work of literature.  Unfortunately, it has been a popular movie because of Dane's and DiCaprio's teen icon status.  This production of Romeo and Juliet has become a fetish of pop culture and it is as thoughtless as a Friday night drinking binge.  The only worse film I can think of is Street Fighter the Movie.  If you like Shakespeare on the screen, STAY AWAY.  Watch Franco Zeffirelli's rich and beautiful masterpiece instead.
B00004U8JV|3.0|After four years of the disater of the could've been Popular Theme Park:Jurassic Park. Now two groups are in a race against time that will determine the fate of the remote island's Prehistoric inhabitants.<br />This sequel has great visual effects by Industrial Light & Magic. But the film suffers a weak Screenplay by David Koepp  (The Trigger Effect, Stir of Echoes). This is Steven Spielberg weakest film to date but this film is still entertaining. DVD's has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer & Superb DTS 5.1 Surround Sound & Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround Sound is also alivable. The weakest in the series. Grade:B-.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool is a group of four excellent musicians that produce something greater than the sum of their individual parts. This is the kind of album that evokes the kind of dark-room-with-headphones-on sessions where you get transported a la Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon'. Like fine art, this album touches and releases a different part of you every time you listen to it ... no matter how many times you do so. This is a true classic and will remembered as such decades from now.

She experinces seizures and bloody wound associated with the crucifixion of Jesus. A Priest-Scientist (Gabriel Byrne) investigates while a Cardinal (Johnathan Pryce) emphasizes public-relation spin over the truth.<br />This supernatural thriller plays at times like an Big-Budget MTV long music video but it's a very stylish film. DVD's has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an Strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The best extra of this film, you could watch this with the Original theatrical ending relase or the Original altertive ending. An running commentary track by the Director:Rupert Wainwright. Super 35. Grade:B+.
B00000DHR0|4.0|This is my favorite Christmas album, and also my favorite Celine Dion album.  I like a lot of Celine's music on her other albums, but I could do without the heavy-handed production and power ballads.  For the most part, there's a lighter touch to the songs and arrangements on this album.  Its nice to hear Celine sing.
079283318X|4.0|The world best Spy 007-James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) years before James Bond had lost his partner in a mission & he blames himself for the death of his Spy friend. Now he's team with a gorgeous computer programmer (Izabella Scorupco), Bond battles a renegade Soivet military officer (Sean Bean) planning to wreak worldwide havoc with a lethal orbiting setellite.<br />Pierce Brosnan is Perfect as the new James Bond. Famke Janssen is a hoot as a Horny German Hit-Woman. Directed by Martin Campbell (The Mask of Zorro, No Escape) shows flair & he also helps, an above average script making the film looks good. A suspense Spy thriller film mixed with good action scenes & humor. One of the Biggest Hit of 1995. Panavision. Grade:B+.
B00005U2LM|4.0|In the generation where Eve and Nelly receives the honor of being the 20th and 21th greatest mc's by BET, hip hop has fallen off terribly. It seems people forgot the 10 emcees from Staten.<BR>The W wasn't a bad album, but it lacked something. Iron Flag capitalizes on somethings the W didn't. &quot;Back in the Game&quot; featuring Ron Isley is produced by the Trackmasters, but you wouldn't know that judging by Fiesta,Fatty Girl and etc. Other Standouts include Ya'll Been Warned, Radioactive, Babies, Soul Power and Uzi. If you are tried of the &quot;jiggy&quot; rap, pick it up&gt;
0385505833|3.0|I do not believe this will be a Christmas classic.  In fact I do not consider it a John Grisham classic.  Nevertheless it is light reading and enjoyable.  The author spins an interesting tale of a couple who had reached the point of not wishing to participate in Christmas activities, at least for this particular Christmas. Perhaps most of us at one time or another were not enthusiastic for Christmas decorating, Christmas shopping or Christmas parties.  This particular couple dicided to do something about it.  As a result we are privy to the obstacles they faced laced with a fair amount of humor. Some Christmas spirit did find its way into the story.
B00005RYQO|5.0|Everything about the movie was great, I loved the cars, the racing, the actors/actresses who were in the movie.  If you like fixed up cars and racing, this is the movie to go with.....Gone In 60 Seconds has nothing on this movie.

Based on a true story, he finds that he cannot attend because of his grades, and goes to a junior college to try to get them improved.  He finally gets accepted to become the smallest, least talented, member of the Notre Dame football team, because of his heart and persistance, only to be on the practice team but not in the playing lineup.  Because of his persistance, the team rallies around him for his Dad and his family because they don't believe that he is on the team, having not seen him even on the bench.  A real heartwarmer.  Don't miss it.
B00005AQF7|4.0|Snoop Dogg's debut 'Doggy Style' was another classic in rap/Crip hop history. A Dr. Dre produced album just a year after \\"The Chronic\\" in 1993. Snoop introduced his layed back G-funk pre-crip hop flow Hit singles like \\"Gin & Juice\\"  \\"Whats my name\\" \\"Murder was the case\\" and \\"pump, pump\\" made Snoop Dogg one of the most successful rapper's in rap/Crip hop history. Any fan of Snoop own's this lp, but for those who don't, let me tell its worth every penny you spend on it.
0671027344|5.0|I also am one who absolutely adored this book. Not only did i find the characters and situations realistic, but i loved the relationships Chbosky created. He made teh peopel seem real adn intense and really allowed you to be brought into the story, the scenes, the complications that each of the characters encounter. As i said in teh title, it was almost depressing to see that i only had 10 pages, then 5 pages, then the last paragraph to read. You want to learn more about Charlie, about Sam and patrick adn you want to continue to hear of their lives. This is a great book that gave me a new insight into life. But like previous reviewers said, it's more of a teenager's book.

In Enders game, by Orson Scott Card the students on this space station are constantly manipulated and forced to encounter situations that could be harmful, so the teachers can know more about them, and therefore decide how to and prepare them to command an army.  Unfortunately, dangerous and harmful things will sometimes happen because of their teachers' decisions.<BR>The book isn't exactly science fiction, even though it deals with things like aliens and space stations.  Instead, much of it is about the human mind, and what is right and wrong.  Should the childrens' lives be at risk so the military can have better commanders?  It takes the reader inside the mind of a child who is in this situation and shows what happens and how he thinks, and what the results are of this school he goes too.  I would recommend this book to people who like science fiction or books that make them think for a long time after reading it.
B00005R2M3|2.0|If you like Alanis you will definitely like Shakira (Shakira was doing this way before Alanis came out).  <br />If you dislike Shakira's little shrieks and choral vowel prolongations then stay away. Sometimes she just loses the tone and is only rescued by the dance beats backing her vocals. Give her some points for the few rap verses - some originality involved.<br />Take away Shakira's voice, and you have some great beats, good melody and great dancing material.<BR>Hopefully, she may get continue with songs like Ojos Asi (English version in this album). She is best when original and when not pretending she has the vocal quality of a Cristina Aguilera.
B000000H66|5.0|In case anyone out there hasn't already heard, Chuck Schuldiner passed away on Thursday, December 13.  He'd long been battling cancer, and was doing fairly well, but it ultimately took his life.  The death metal genre has produced some really great bands, but Death was one of the best and most influential bands of them all.  They combined heavy, thrashy elements with more melodic, progressive parts.  They paved the way for bands such as Children of Bodom, Opeth, Arch Enemy, Morbid Angel, and many others.  IMO, they never made a bad album in their entire career, but this one here showcases their abilities like no other.  Chuck was an amazing guitarist, one of the greatest of all time (up there with Yngwie).  He could create a perfect balance between heaviness and melody that was just awe-inspiring.  And, as if that wasn't enough, he was one heck of a songwriter.  The lyrics on this album are the most intelligent and introspective I've heard in a death metal album.  His vocals were great too, very harsh and abrasive.  Then, there's Gene Hoglan.  Now this guy can play the drums!  Very few drummers can match this guy's speed and technical skill (I wonder who would win between him and Mike Portnoy in a drumming contest?  That'd be interesting.).  Man, I just can't say enough about this album.  If you love death metal, you need this album in your collection.  Just listen to &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot;, &quot;Crystal Mountain&quot;, or the title track, and you'll know what I mean.  God bless you Chuck, the metal world will never be the same without you.
0743216385|5.0|I viewed both the HBO series and read the book  Both were faithful to each other and to the brave soldiers of the 506th Inf Regt and the rest of the 101st Division.  The book is a &quot;must buy&quot;.  When the video becomes available, that will also be on my &quot;must buy&quot; list.<br />Sam Carlson<br />US Army (Retired)
B00003CY0V|4.0|This is the type of movie that would wake someone up after viewing all of the other (stuff)released this year. I totally enjoyed this film, and I always like a movie that isn't easily predictable, this one had some interesting twists and turns. When I say \\"Eye candy\\" I'm of course talking about the spectacular 10 second sequence involving C4 and ball bearings that set off a beautiful explosion. This is definately on my list as one of the 10 best films of the year.
B000007O9L|5.0|The Stones have actually put out a ridiculous number of live albums, some of which are quite good and remain in their catalogue justifiably.  &quot;Stripped&quot; is by far the best, because in reality it is a bunch of alternative performances of some of their best songs that wouldn't sound good belted above the roar of a stadium sound system.  Such as: Sweet Virginia, Love in Vain, Angie, Wild Horses, The Spider and the Fly.<br />The playing on this album is a preview of coming attractions--the Stones in the 2010s, when they will sit on barstools at little clubs and amaze their fans with intimate, tasty versions like these of their vast repertoire of music.  Everyone sounds great, but especially check out Charlie Watts, the drummer's drummer, who plays with a jazzman's delicacy here.
0553210246|1.0|IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS BOOK, SAVE YOURSELF SOME TIME AND WALK INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC NOW!  I was forced to read this book for my english class.  It was terrible!  Sure the plot line, and even some of the characterization was fine, but MY GOD THE DESCRIPTION goes on and on and on and on.  Theres almost 4 pages dedicated to describing a building!  If I was given the choice between reading this book, or hitting myself in the head with it for the rest of my life, I would go with the hitting on the head one...becuase i'm sure its even less brain-numbing than Hardy's writing.
0767812387|5.0|i named it that because after watching this film all u think abou is music this film is brilliant. Its by chance we switched it over and saw it chayanne a ndvanessa make a great couple and they dance brilliant. while watching this you feel like getting up and dancing its by far in my top 3 dance films better than dirty dancin i did not know vanessa could dance like that the cuban music and caribbean music is similar calipso i guess thats why i love this film so much. Ive watched this film around 12 times and ill keep on watchin it worth you last 20 quid. excelent.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Wow! I am amazed by Skaira. I must admit, the first time I heard the album, I was a little disapointed. It didn't really catch my attention right away. But after listening to it a few more times, I must say it is one of the greatest albums to come out this year! She uses a lot of different styles on this album, including pop, ballads, spanish, and dance. I was impressed with her ability to write in english, as she did write all of the songs on this album. You should definitely check it out, It's not your typical pop album. Shakira shows that she has the ability to crossover into the english language market, and she will be around for years to come. BTW- I just recently saw her live at a radio show, and let me tell you, she is just as amazing singing live as she is on the cd!
0790738074|5.0|This is a classic, old favorite.  Why don't they make movies like this anymore?  Have our senses dulled so much that we have to be run over before we like something?  I don't think so, and that is why I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  I know he'll like it.  Everyone does.  I wonder if Philomath City could have a boy's band.
0446608955|5.0|I thought this book was one of the best that I have read in a long time.  I have already read it twice and I'm sure there will be many more times I pick up &quot;A walk to Remember&quot;.  I have read other books by Nichalos Sparks, and I think, by far, this one is the best.  I give it two thumbs up, and I can't wait to see the movie when it comes out.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The best drama ever made.  Was not to fond of #3 but the first 2 are masterpieces.  The Corleones Rule.
B00005OB0A|5.0|This is an incredible CD.  I love Kylie's new, breathy, girlish voice - she's the post-modern Marilyn Monroe.  CGYOOMH is incredibly catchy, and I love the 'La, la, la' chorus.  'Come Into My World' is great, too.  But for me the standout track is 'Fever', which is poppy and fun, but has a strange melancholy, especially when Kylie sings 'Don't you feel the fever like I do?' People are hung up on comparing Kylie to Madonna, but Kylie is very different from La Ciccone; Kylie is both campier and more down to earth.  American audiences may have caught Miss Minogue's cameo as the Green Fairy in 'Moulin Rouge'; for me, those few minutes of film sum her up - campy, sexy and cute as a bug's ear! I HEART KM!
0790734850|5.0|A movie that made you feel for the characters and at the same time made you think.  Although I was saddened (...to..) discover who the real bad guy is.  Great movies like this just arent made anymore.  If you like this watch \\"The Usual Suspects\\".  Also with Kevin Spacey.
0441003257|5.0|I've only read two Discworld books, but I've loved Neil Gaiman's Sandman for ages.  I had heard great things about Pratchett, though, so I knew this would be a good one. It certainly didn't disappoint, as the book is almost Adams like in its absurdity.  You'll laugh out loud from the first couple of pages.<br />Starting out with a mix-up during the birth of the Anti-Christ, things spiral out of control from there.  Crowley and Aziraphale (a demon and an angel) try to stop armageddon from happening because they like living on Earth too much. Of course, Armageddon is already having trouble starting since the Anti-Christ is nowhere to be found.  Throw in a couple of witch-finders, the descendent of Agnes Nutter (author of The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch), a gang of school children, and many, many more memorable characters, there's a laugh on almost every page.  Even the bit parts are good.<br />Gaiman's mythological humour makes a good combination with Pratchett's absurdity.  Underneath all of the weird situations, you can see Gaiman's knowledge of myth and legend shining through.  The dialogue is great, so much so that the most absurd situations seem very real.  The reactions of the characters, while really strange when you think about them, seem very proper and realistic.<br />I have just finished re-reading it, and I had forgotten just how much enjoyment I got out of this book.  It's a heavy subject (the end of the world), but done with such a humorous touch that it's not a heavy book.  If you've read any of the Discworld books, or Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker books, you'll find the same style of humour in here.  If you like this type of humour (and not everybody does), you will love this book.  It may offend you if you're a fundamentalist, but that's the only worry.<br />And whatever you do, don't leave your cassette tapes in your car too long...I'd hate to have to listen to Britney Spears sing &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; or Pavarotti's &quot;We Are the Champions.&quot;i's &quot;We Are the Champions.&quot;
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Hands down the best computer animated film ever made.  Even better than the two Toy Story filmes (which I both loved).  The voice acting by Mike, Eddie, Cameron &amp; John were awesome.  You cared for the characters and it was very funny.  Way to go Dreamworks.
B00005PJ6M|4.0|Much funnier than the original which was funny by itself.  Too bad Alex Winter hasn't done more work even if what he has done since is hilarious.  Seeing Steve Vai brings back bad hair band memories.
B00005Q4CS|3.0|I had no idea what to expect from this film, having ordered it for a Christmas present for a relative (it was on their Xmas list).  I couldn't resist watching it before wrapping it up, though.  I was really impressed by the DVD itself.  The surround sound is excellent, especially for such a low budget film, and the transfer is really great, too.  As for the movie itself, I found it technically well executed, especially the editing, but the whole experience left me empty and vaguely depressed.  I found the plot and characters to be manipulative as opposed to realistic.  While this isn't always a bad thing, I didn't feel like it really worked as far as believability.  And the characters were unlikeable at best, so the impact of watching their downward spiral was really diminished.  For MTV addicts, this film may be right up your alley, but if you're looking for an involving story--rather than a technical acheivement on the level of music videos--look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a film dealing with heroin addiction, I'd recommend Trainspotting, which towers over Requiem on every level.<br />I'm giving this film 3 stars solely based on the technical merits.  Had I rated it exclusively on the plot, characters, and emotional impact, I'd probably have given it one star.  I'd put this movie on the same plane as Gummo; while Requiem is far more slick and flashy, it shares Gummo's depressing pointlessness, viewer manipulation, and lack of realism in its overall outlook. <br />Having viewed the movie once, I certainly won't be doing so a second time. And that's saying something in my case since I'm an avid collector with several hundred DVDs, many of which I watch multiple times.
6304510861|5.0|If you have not seen LOST HIGHWAY, do not read these reviews, as they will spoil it. My advice is to go and rent the film, and then read online reviews after you've seen it, if nessesary.
B000002JPA|5.0|What? Average of 4.5 Stars? - can't be. This album is the birth of prog-metal and still the best in this section. All prog-metal albums have to be compared to Images &amp; Words and only one has reached to be on the same level yet: Mt.pt.2. <BR>That the worst/simplest (but still very good) song, 'Pull Me Under', of I&amp;W is the most famous shows me, that 'normal' music listeners aren't able to understand those other masterpieces like 'Mt.pt.1', 'Surrounded' and 'Learning To Live', which is maybe DT's best song. Everybody who's interested in demanding music and willing to Take (The) Time to get inspired of it, will love I&amp;W and also give 5(!) stars, because it's simply the best rock music can offer today.
0792837916|3.0|Funky Elmore Leonard tale that gets in digs against Hollywood.  Hackman has a knack for playing smarmy characters, and Dennis Farina (a former Chicago cop) plays a good heavy.
B000002ADT|5.0|This album is smooth the whole way through.  So perfect for every mood and I haven't yet met a person that didn't enjoy every second of it. If you own only one jazz album, make it this one!
6300246787|4.0|Ms. Streisand was too young for the role (she was in her late twenties), but she belts out the score with exuberance.  Walter Matthau was always perfect playing grouches, and he does a great job here as Vandergelder.  Michael Crawford (pre-Phantom of the Opera) is appropriately nerdy playing Cornelius Hackl.  Watch for leggy Tommy Tune as the boyfriend of Vandergelder's niece.  I could see why this movie wasn't a big hit, though; it was an old fashioned musical released in 1969, when audiences were looking for film entertainment that was more hard edged.  An pleasant way to spend a couple of hours, anyway.
B00004U28G|5.0|My friends and I rented this movie the other night and were totally in stiches at the madcap hijinks of the film! Car racing is so cool and it's such a great idea to incorporate that theme into a comedy. Hardly anything is funnier. Jackie Chan is a total riot! Jamie Farr...well, who can say enough! Farrah Faucet is a complete knock-out and plays her part so well. Her comic timing is brilliant! Burt Reynolds is his sexy self, as usual. My friend Karen liked it best when Dom Deluise was dressed up as his superhero alter-ego. I'd tell you what Carlson's favorite moment was but then I'd ruin the plot so I better keep it to myself. Go out and rent this immediately  (or, better yet, buy a copy so you can watch it over and over again!)
B00004WGC4|5.0|Basil Fawlty says things to customers that I wish I had the nerve to say when someone at my job gets on my last nerve.  I actually find myself cheering him on esp. when he encounters a really difficult hotel guest.  For example, I was dying laughing when he yelled into the hearing aid of that one woman who kept snapping at him and the staff.  When he socked it to that guy (comic Bernard Cribbins) whom he thought was a hotel inspector, I was clapping in approval.  Nothing beats watching Basil handle folks after coming home from a hard day at work!
B00000INEX|5.0|I bought this video for my then 4 month old grandson. Even at 4 months old, he loves it! It is so amazing to me to see such a young infant be so ingrossed in a video of any kind. It's like he can't take his eyes off it.  Great video- I can't wait to get him more of this series!
B00005B4GU|5.0|This is a big departure from OK computer. Recorded at the same time as Kid A, it is understandable that Amnesiac was released secondly and seperatly - If what was included on Kid A was a natural progression for the band, then this is a few steps farther off the deep end. Great music for your head, but I'd suggest listening to Kid A before getting this one (although in the long run this is better).
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The wide range of colors used in Moulin Rouge is fantastic. The sound is also wonderful. Great DVD to show off your home theatre system.
B00005QG9J|5.0|ok all incubus fans can admit when they heard science they immediatly said &quot;can they release a follow up as good as this?&quot; . the answer (in my opinion) was no. make yourself was a close second to science. now another question...... can the new cd &quot;morning view&quot; match up to make yourself???? the answer (in my opinion) is no. but not selling it short its a great cd. from &quot;nice to know you&quot;, to &quot;aquaneous transmission&quot;. when it comes to diversity morning view is more diverse with emotion and good solid just plain rockin tracks......they perfect both styles. &quot;nice to know you&quot; which i believe is their second single is great, an opener that made you want to listen on, &quot;circles&quot; got a little annoying. and to tell the truth i got sick to tears of &quot;i wish you were here&quot; mainly because of the long wait you had between the release of that single and the album release. &quot;just a phase&quot; comes off as very emotional, certainly one of the brightest of bright spots. the strings play well into the instrumental in the beginning of the song. and the lyrics were holeless. &quot;11am&quot;, very sweet song, i guess its about losing a love but i am not good at these things.&quot;blood on the ground&quot; is SCIENCE like in its lyrics and Make yourself like in its music and adds something i cant put my finger on to make it great. &quot;mexico&quot; very sweet song, if i were to compare &quot;drive&quot; (the make yourself acoustic song) to this song Mexico would be so much better. mexico is a lot more detailed and its an example of incubuses perfected emotion.&quot;warning&quot; i hear alot of people saying this will be a big single if they choose to release it. i am not one to agree, not taking away from the goodness of the song but its not of the calibur of &quot;just a phase&quot;, &quot;have you ever&quot; is one of my liest favorite tracks. its just a little annoying the guitar riff, to start off and as youget deeper. &quot;are you in&quot;, the instrumental, this one has words, it doesnt matter though, i liked battlestar scralatchtica, i liked magic medicine and this one landed somewhere in between,&quot;Under my umbrella&quot; i like because its very magistic, at first then its kinda angry in the chorus, and finnally &quot;aquaneor transmission&quot;, the long lasting song that seems to catch your mind until the last croak of the frogs,i dont know why this song is so magical it just trances me, puts me in another world, it actually puts me in the situation where i am alone and just floating down a river and not caring where i am going. <BR>well thats about it, if you managed to read the whole thing i hope you found this review helpful
B000002UA9|4.0|Millions of people around the world consider The Beatles to be the greatest rock and roll band of all time and this was their beginning.  Simply put, this is fourteen songs of good, early 60's, young man's rock and roll.  While there are some cover songs/songs written by others, including the slow groovin' &quot;Anna (Go to Him)&quot; and the raucous &quot;Boys&quot;, it was notable at the time that a band of four young men would release an album containing eight original songs out of fourteen.<br />Among those are the great &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; (definitely a top 20 Beatles song for me), the title song (also great), and &quot;Love Me Do&quot; with excellent harmonica by Lennon.<br />One minus: there are times when noise can be heard behind the songs. This, I attribute to early 60's recording methods but I would think that the sound could be cleaned up a bit now. That aside, this is good music by a great band and the beginning of an era that would change music forever. For those that do not like anything pre-Revolver or Sgt. Pepper, there's no way those albums could have been created had there not been a Please Please Me a few years before.
630463949X|4.0|If you've forgotten about the magic these five hyper-talented musicians are capable of on stage, then spend a few minutes watching &quot;I'm So Afraid&quot;, &quot;Silver Springs&quot;, and &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot;. Nicks may have lost her upper register, but she traded it in for one of the most powerful rock and roll voices we've heard since Janis Joplin. Buckingham's guitar work is masterful and along with Nicks he still manages to bring chills and smiles to fans around the world. Christine McVie is as usual, a little boring when it comes to stage presence but she wrote some wonderful songs over the years - so it's nice to watch her on stage with the rest of Fleetwood Mac. Now if they would only lose the back up musicians and singers, we'd have the old band back playing at the peak of their carreers.
B00005QDW1|3.0|Its nice to get a cd from No Doubt again. I think 'Simple Kind of Life' is my favorite. Also topping my list 'Hey Baby', 'Rock Steady', 'Marry Me'. At the bottom of my list would put their 'reggae' experiments such as 'Start the Fire' and 'Underneath it All.' I really didn't care for them at all.<BR>Compared to previous cd's this one isn't as good, but for a No Doubt fan its not a bad buy.
B00005OWIU|5.0|John Williams has done it again, like he did it with the Star Wars Trilogy..<br />He has composed a gathering of tracks which reflects the mood of the BOOK and the MOVIE together... It's incredible to put it shortly..<br />If you ain't gonna watch the movie,you should ATLEAST buy the CD..
B00004U8P3|5.0|What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said in thousands of reviews previously.  I love this movie.  I love dinosaurs.  Ever since 1st grade(I'm almost 34 now)I've loved these beasties.  The whole Jurassic Park Trilogy (and how long will it simply remain a trilogy?!?)are simply great, sit-down, grab a bucket of popcorn, eye-candy movies.  Plot?  They have some, but if you want plot, watch Shindler's List, or Gone with the Wind.  This is dinosaurs running wild, and what's wrong with that?  Oh, the Tyrannosaur scene is still the best &quot;movie monster&quot; scene ever!
B00003CXTG|1.0|I love Ben Affleck.  I love Ben Affleck in tank tops or otherwise snug shirts.  That alone is not enough to make a movie, though.  I thought this movie was dreadful.  Abysmal.  Hackneyed, trite plot mechanisms, historically off-base in many ways, and an insult to the memories of the people who really lived and died at Pearl Harbor to serve up tripe like this as \\"tribute.\\"  You want to learn about Pearl Harbor?  Go to the library, or down to the VFW and ask someone.  But save your money and do not bother with this stinker.
B00004U8JV|5.0|It's hard for me to write a review of this.  This is more of an editorial.  I love dinosaurs.  I love the whole Jurassic Park Trilogy.  How can someone with a passion for dinosaurs NOT like these movies.  Yet a lot of people dislike, even hate, The Lost World.  Why?  The effects are as good if not better than the first.  You get not one, but TWO Tyrannosaurs.  Alot of &quot;new&quot; dinosaurs not seen in the first.  And best of all, the Godzilla/San Diego scene of a Tyrannosaur running amok in the Big City.  Like the first movie, this is Eye Candy.  It's a popcorn movie.  To be honest, I actually like it a little MORE than the first.... which I adore.
B000002MY3|5.0|The ultimate in feminist rock, this album became a best seller and the biggest selling album by a female ever until Shania Twain's `Come On Over' was released.<br />`Jagged Little Pill' defined a whole new genre in female rock.  With Alanis's vocals perfectly fitted to the angry lyrics, and this is an angry album in general.  Tracks like `You Oughta Know' have become legendary, with many suggestions being put forward as to who inspired the tune.  What makes the album special though is that whilst being personal, Alanis never loses sight of what the listener wants and there are no songs on here that are so personal to the extent that you can't relate to them.  Also impressive is the fact that this isn't an album that consists of singles and filler.  Tracks such as `Right Through You' and `Forgiven' stand up alongside such greats as `One Hand In My Pocket' and `Ironic'.<br />If you're not into the highly fuelled anger behind many of Alanis's songs, then you'll probably find songs such as `Head Over Feet' and `Shower' (the hidden bonus track) more to your liking.  Without a doubt these songs show that Alanis isn't all feminist anger, but there's a lot more to her as well.  This remains the best of all of her four albums, deserving its success fully.  This album is greater testament to the fact that both Alanis Morissette and Glen Ballard, who produced the album, are geniuses.
B00003CXXS|5.0|People are strange animals. Dinosaur lovers are even more so. Until the Jurassic Park Trilogy, we only had Godzilla, Dinosaurus!, Valley of Gwangi, and a few others with guys in rubber suits. So why do so many JP Lovers, dislike, even hate, this movie?  So why a JPIII?  Why not?  The first two were boxoffice hits for Universal, so do the math.  The whole Trilogy has taken spfx to new heights, these dinosaurs are ALIVE! JPIII has a lot of fun scenes, great action, and you gotta love the whole Spinosaur/Tyrannosaur fight, right outta King Kong! It's great stuff!!! And the Pteranodons were fantastic! Here's looking ahead to Jurassic Park IV!
0385335482|5.0|From the moment I saw this book, I knew I had to read this.<br />From the moment I started I knew it was very much like me, many times I've just thrown away those credit card bills because I didn't want to see what was inside of them. Rebecca has the same idea I have, why worry about paying off that debt just go out and buy yourself something to make you feel better.<br />Now onto the book. Rebecca has a job that doesn't make as much money as she needs. She struggles to find something that makes her more money. She takes a few jobs but at all of them she fails out. Finally she hits a point in her life where she can't escape and she has to finally figure out ways, after a few bad choices she finally comes upon something that is just right for her and everything works out just fine.<br />Overall this was a very quick and light read. I would recommend this to anyone who is in debt and needs a good pick me up.<br />I can't wait for next book about Rebecca.
B0000027RL|5.0|I feel that you are missing the point of one of, if not the greatest release of our young generation.  Where Nirvana reluctanly hogged the grunge spotlight, and the subsequent critical acclaim for their 'Nevermind' album, Pearl Jam was developing a sound that would be their signature for years to come.  Far better than can be said for any other band of the genre, considering that not a single one of them still makes music today.  Melodic, while rocking out, the soundtrack that is 'Ten' made an indelible mark on millions of angst teens that has since helped shape the world we live in.  <br />Pearl Jam is one of the great bands of all time, and certianly the best since the 90's.<br />Just my $.02 worth.
B000059HAI|5.0|Simply the best movie about the attack on Pearl Harbor made yet to date. Accurate and spectacular, a great combination. A must have for anyone.
B000002UAI|4.0|This album has always, through the years, taken it's share of knocks from critics and fans alike. To the ears of this old Beatlemaniac, though, Beatles For Sale holds up very well.The group was clearly up against it: they had recorded, in 1964, some great singles (&quot;I Feel Fine&quot;/&quot;She's A Woman&quot; &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot;) and an absolute gem of a soundtrack LP (all original compositions including some wonderful songs like &quot;Things We Said Today&quot; &quot;Anytime At All&quot; and &quot;I'll Be Back&quot; that didn't even appear in the film!) Already, by the autumn of 1964: dozens of terrific songs recorded and released, constant international touring, an acclaimed film completed, but STILL...the record company demanded a new LP for the Christmas market! So the challenge was laid down. I don't think the Fabs backed away one inch. Yes, they filled the gaps with some rock and roll chestnuts from their Reeperbahn days (&quot;Mr.Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Kansas City&quot;.) But surrounding the tiny chinks, John and Paul heaped on another five or six songs every bit as good as the gems from A Hard Day's Night including &quot;Eight Days A Week&quot; &quot;No Reply&quot; &quot;What You're Doing&quot; &quot;Every Little Thing&quot; and &quot;I Don't Want To Spoil The Party.&quot; First class writing and recording, absolutely. Please put this achievement in context. At the end of the most exhausting and demanding year in their history, the Beatles didn't resort to scraping the bottom of an old barrel. They marched into Abbey Road Studios and hand-crafted a pretty solid little treasure chest!
B000002J1O|5.0|Simply this is one of rock's most beautifully crafted albums. For me the best Genesis ever did with Peter Gabriel. Every player gave their best in terms of musical &amp; writting ability to contribute to each track. All of Genesis trademark sounds are included: Gabriel (and the rest of the band as well) lyrics, Collins excellent drumming, Hackett soulfull solosand both Banks clever keyboard sound and Rutherford bass and arregements. What makes this recording so good is who well the tracks are sequenced and linked to each other.

B00005RIKD|5.0|Sting has stayed on top of the music business because he has always found ways to discover new sounds and angles in which to appreciate his own music. Like Peter Gabriel, he has had the ability to move foward on every record he makes. I compare this live recording with the Live video/dvd taped at the begining of the Brand New Day tour a year early and he and the band have developed new arregenmets to the songs that they have played for over a year. This is, from my point of view, quite  amazin as it shows how the band has mature by playing together over time. Also, I own a series of live Sting concerts both CD and video and each time Sting and Co.deliver something different and entretaining. <br />Interesting to note, ...All this time is more jazz and soul oriented of Sting's albums and for the first time uses violins &amp; cellos as part of the live setting. The performance, as expected, is superior. The set list is well balance covering songs from Stings solo career albums and Police era. My only complaint is that a single CD is too short. Sting has enough material for a double CD so I hope in the future there could be a chance to have a Live Box set that gives us a comprehensive overview of his music development over time.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|And it ends right here. Without question, the DVD edition of 'Moulin Rouge' is by far the best-produced DVD of the year. Its obvious that the people making this disc were lovers of the film. Every scene sparkles with digital mastering that we've only thus far dreamt of, and the soundtrack is a hundred times better than the ones we've come to expect of DVDs in recent times. If you already own the soundtrack, the songs take on new life on this disc. This is a sinful delight if there ever was one.<br />Alright, so by this time you probably know the story. This review is to focus on the quality of the DVD and its' content. To be fair, the DVD for 'Moulin Rouge' could well be compared to one that was released earlier in the year - 'The Sound of Music'. Like that film, this is a double disc set, and like that film, it has extras all around. The only distinct difference is that the film quality here is markedly better (natural, since 'Moulin Rouge' is a product of the 2000s). It is heartening to note that despite the loads of trite and useless titles published by the studios each week, there are still a few worth buying and not merely renting. This DVD is one of them. Get it now. Emphasis on all three words, my dears.<br />Fans of the movie will be pleased to note that the makers of this product have given due respect to the word 'extras'. First of all, I must bring to your attention that this is the Widescreen version of the film, and NOT the standard version as was originally advertised on DVD talk forums early on. There is no standard full screen mode here, so if thats a problem for you, don't get it. However, for those of us who have no problem with widescreen and the two black bars on the top and bottom, this is a purchase well worth investing in. The film is close-captioned, by the way. And it has Dolby Surround Sound.<br />Disc One : Aside from the entire film, this disc also has a commentary by Baz Luhrmann, Catherine Martin, and Don McAlpine. I dont know if any of you have seen the Bravo TV Special on the movie, but it seems that these bits featured on that show as well. For some reason, watching Baz talk is not as interesting as I thought it would be.<br />Disc One also has writing commentary by Baz Luhrmann and Craig Pearce, and 8 behind the scenes branches. An interesting note here : most of you who buy this DVD will realize that the whenever the musical pieces come on, the sound quality automatically betters itself - could it be that the spoken portions are actually in mono? I don't think so, but you decide for yourself. Since the songs were all prerecorded in a studio, their quality differs from the dialogue portion, leading to some interesting results. It takes a while getting used to. Musical numbers to watch out for are Nicole Kidman doing a Marilyn Monroe/Madonna take with 'Diamonds are a girls best friend', and the poignant duet 'Come what may'. However, the song I most liked (and its not on the soundtrack) was the version of Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' sung by a chorus of fat old balding men. Incredible, but it works.<br />Disc Two : I don't know what they did with the Bravo TV Special which was infinitely better than the HBO documentary. In any case, we get The Making of Moulin Rouge HBO Special in all its glory here. Gosh, Nicole looks really pasty.<br />The second disc also has 5 &quot;Star&quot; featurettes, Earlier drafts of screenplay (this is not as exciting as you'd think it would be, believe me), 6 extended scenes &amp; 4 re-cut dance sequences (this is the BIGGEST BOON for all us fans of the film. To our delight, it includes the MUCH-LOVED version of 'Spectacular, Spectacular'). There is also an interview with John &quot;Cha Cha&quot; O'Connell and Caroline O'Connor.<br />There are also a few 'Easter Eggs' : hidden clues and little baubles that take you to the special parts of the DVD. Unfortunately, this disc is also very heavily dependent on DVD-ROM, which means that you cant access much stuff through your basic DVD player. The last thing I wanted to see were screens that said 'Insert disc into DVD-ROM drive'. But oh well, the disc on the whole is great.<br />On a more dismal note, the second DVD also includes the music video for 'Lady Marmalade' by Christina Aguilera, Mya, Pink, and L'il Kim. I don't know if this is a good thing, but its there, just in case. Sound quality is absolutely fabulous throughout.<br />All in all, a fabulous attempt to put one of the year's best films onto digital disc. The only thing I was upset about is that my favorite song off the soundtrack 'Complainte.' by Rufus Wainwright is not featured prominently.<br />On a side note, the making of featurette also introduces us to Kylie Minogue, the UK's biggest singing star, who plays the Green Fairy (shes adorable). There is a sequence where she sings 'The Sound of Music'. You may want to replay that one for a while.<br />Come to think of it, you may want to sit through both discs more than once. The jury is out, well, to me at least, 'Moulin Rouge' is a desert island DVD, one that you can't do without. And if you like this one, do keep an eye out for 'The Princess and the Warrior' and 'The Children of Paradise' releasing on DVD in January 2002.<br />Highly, highly recommended.our basic DVD player.

B00005R87Q|5.0|A movie.  What is a movie?  A movie is the chance for people to step, if only for two hours, into a world they can never be a part of.  I have read many of the one star reviews for this film and I can't believe that these people have seen the same movie I have.  This movie is a visual and audio &quot;ride&quot; throughout.  <BR>I highly recomend this movie for anyone that enjoys a fun two hours watching some cool cars going really fast.  Vin Diesel is one of my new favorite actors since seeing him in Pitch Black and I enjoyed watching him in The Fast and The Furious.<BR>Please keep all arms, legs, and head inside the ride at all times.  Please remain seated until the movie comes to a complete stop.  Exit to the right and please, Drive Home Safely.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie is hands down the best movie of 2001. A true mind bending experience that has you second guessing yourself everytime. Just when you think you have figured out the flicks nifty twisted plot you are fooled.<br />Chris Nolan's direction is superb and innovative. The movie starts at the end and goes backward in ten minute intervals. Taking you to the beginning to see where it all started. The flick has a great leading man in Guy Pearce. New Market Films should push his performance for Oscar consideration. He turns in one of the best performances of 2001. The supporting players are cool, Carrie Ann Moss delivers a solid performance.<br />This was one of the best flicks of 2001. It is rare that you find a movie with plot twists that aren't hokey or dumb like &quot;Vanilla Sky.&quot; If you haven't seen it you should soon.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Howard Shore's score to The Lord Of The Rings is so powerful. And it's great that Enya did two beautiful songs in the film. Some of the score is harmony music and some are dark and powerful with a choir. I like the powerful choir music best, like in the track \\"The Bridge Of Khazad Dum\\". But when i saw the film I notised that there where more music in the film. It was some fighting music that was missing in the soundtrack. And the opening music in the film was missing in the soundtrack. The film builds up higher with this score.
0920668364|4.0|WELL, I THOUGHT THIS WAS A GREAT BOOK, BUT AS I CAN SEE FROM SOME OF THE OTHER REVIEWS,SOME DIDNT!  I, TO AM REALLY CURIOUS AS TO WHY THE REACTIONS TO THIS STORY ARE SO EXTREME??  MY BOYFRIEND AND I WERE BORED ONE NIGHT AND WENT TO THE BOOK STORE AND I MADE HIM READ IT.  HE HATED IT AND SAID IT WAS FREAKY.  I, ON THE OTHER HAND, LOVE IT AND SO DOES MY NIECE.  I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON THE WAY U LOOK AT IT...I ONLY SEE THE MOTHER DOING THESE THINGS AS A SYMBOL OF LOVE, NOT TO PUSH MOTHERS TO ACTUALLY HAUL UP A LADDER INTO HER SONS WINDOW.  MAYBE WE SHOULDNT LOOK THAT FAR INTO IT, ITS A KIDS BOOK.  THEY THINK ITS CUTE! :)
B00000K3D4|4.0|In the the 80's, a load of fantasy movies was released, both animated movies and real movies, and 'Labyrinth' was one of the best, and you have to watch it sometimes to find out what's really going on, i think you never get tired of watching this philosophical fantasy movie.<BR>I think that David Bowie should have won an Oscar for his acting as The Goblin King, he is not only evil, but both smart and he shows his heart.<BR>The art direction is dazzling, the acting and the many different characters is too, and the music and the songs are outstanding, but the movie gets slow at times.<BR>The Goblin King, Sir Didymus and Ludo steals every scene!<BR>If you love fantasy movies, buy this classic masterpiece!
B00005U2LM|5.0|This album is very similar to, but much better than the W. That is, it is not like Enter the Wu-Tang, because the feel is more artsy like the rest of their new ish. If the Wu went back to making more posse cuts and the songs like on IRON FLAG, I would write a letter to Amazon demanding I be able to give them six stars. This is a great CD, there are heart-felt story raps like &quot;Babies&quot; and of course the Wu-Banga's like &quot;Uzi&quot;. The clan keeps more to themself this time around, that means no Redman, Nas or Snoop. This is a mixed blessing. If you like U-god, Masta Killah and Cappadonna, then u get to hear a lot more of them on this album. (U-God most underrated MC of all time!!!)However if you only like big name MCs then u will not like this as much, but you will still like it.<BR>    All in all, this is a great album, and everyone should get it if they have a pulse- and if that pulse beats to the tune of RZA production.
0748662731|5.0|Minimum violence, sex, profanity but full of a charming and unforgettable characters, Precious Ramotswe, her able assistant Mma Makutsi, her fiance Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni and a colorful cast of others.  Set in Botswana, Africa, it has widened my appreciation of that country and it's culture.  I could not stop until I had read all three books in this series and I enjoyed each one more than the other.  Buy these books because you will want to share them with your friends.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|One of the greatest things about music is that there is so much of it. Everyday you hear new bands and with some, you actually go out and buy their albums. A year ago a friend of mine introduced me to At The Drive-In (ATDI). When I first listened to the cd I can honestly say I wasn't a fan. At the time I was all about Emo and had softer music going in my cd player. When I finally sat down and gave them a chance I came to realize just how amazing this band is. ATDI has come to be one of my favorite bands. <br />When listening to ATDI you have to go deeper. At first the guitar sounds sparattic, but the more you listen, the more it makes sense. I usually compare these guys to a Heavier and faster Radiohead, with the intensity and sometimes similar sound to Rage Against the Machine. The Guitar parts use many sweet effects and quirky lines. The guitar parts, if played on their own, would make no sense. But, when combined, are awesome.<br />Pattern Against User has to be one of my all time favorite songs. One Armed Scissors is a great song and made it on the radio. Enfilade has a kinda eerie begining, but the bass line is just too good. <br />I could talk about why this album [rocks so much], but then you would be reading, and not buying. I personally cherish this CD a lot in my collection. There are no bands like ATDI and since they are now broken up, I hope there never will be. <br />This truly is a 5 star album. Do yourself a favor, and get a copy.
0385484518|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  It is amazing how much Albom was able to pack into 192 pages.  I never thought that Albom would be able to portray a life in such a slim book, but he does that and more.  By the end, I felt like I had sat at Morrie's knee.<BR>Mitch Albom is a lucky man.  But how many of us might have a Morrie in our life and take it for granted or not even know it?  Thanks, Mitch and Morrie, for reminding us of what is important.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin, though they may not be pretty or artsy or anything could throw down some damn good rock music.  This album is second only to Led Zeppelin 2 in my opinion as far as Zeppelin albums.  And these guys weren't brain dead musically either.  Have you ever wondered why every garage band in the whole world seems to screw up Black Dog?  Well let me tell ya, it's because it's not in 4/4 time like every other song ever recorded so they always try and bully it and make it fit into a typical rythmn.  Rock and Roll is classic Zep and The Battle of Evermore is sufficently moody with it's refrences to Lord of the Rings.  Stairway to Heaven is of course a masterpiece and a very atypical song.  You tell me how many times you've heard a recorder played on a blues based rock album and it works great as a giant creschendo.  Misty Mountain Hop is a pretty good song and Going to California isn't bad either.  When the Levy Breaks and Four Sticks are vintage Zeppelin tunes and pretty good straight up blues.  So overall great musicanship, vocals, and an all around good band putting out a good album.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Let's face it.  If you're like me, you haven't been really into the Floyd since high school or maybe college when you sat for hours with glazed eyes and enlarged pupils, lying on the floor jonesing for more doritos and putting every iota of your energy into &quot;seeing&quot; the seagulls in &quot;Echoes.&quot;  You probably have some combination of &quot;The Wall,&quot; &quot;Dark Side,&quot; &quot;Meddle&quot; &quot;UmmaGummma&quot; and &quot;The Final Cut&quot; on vinyl or tape which you can't or don't play anymore.  <BR>If that's the case, as with me, then you will love this disc!  You won't care that &quot;Echoes&quot; is 6 minutes shorter, it's a great tune; it rocks, funks, spaces out -- all in 17 delightful minutes.  You'll get all the early Syd tunes you'll ever need, except &quot;Careful with that Axe, Eugene,&quot; and every tune, with the exception of most of the post-Roger Waters stuff, will take you back in the most pleasant of ways.  <BR>The sound quality is superb; the selection is solid, and the non-chronological presentation makes you listen anew to songs you have long liked and introduces you to the songs you don't already know.  So replace the vinyl and take a trip down memory lane.
B000002IOW|4.0|Presto is like a little shining diamond in snow. It is absolutely unlike any other Rush album and is so far removed from its studio predecessor (Hold Your Fire) that it is the very staple of the Rush spirit - change.<BR>What was so refreshing about this album upon release was the lack of synthesizers, this is not a complaint however; Signals through to Hold Your Fire is one of the most exciting phases of Rush's career but I think it came full circle with the breathtaking beauty of Hold Your Fire. Rush had taken this style of their music quite simply - to the limits.<BR>The Pass and Presto perfectly showcased the new sound of Rush with the latter track featuring acoustic guitars aplenty and one of Lifeson's most simple, yet effective solos to date. Indeed Lifeson's guitar work as a whole enjoyed a healthy step towards the forefront of the Rush sound, an attribute unheard since their classic Moving Pictures album.<BR>Presto stands alongside Counterparts as one of the landmarks of Rush in the 90's. Counterparts developing the musical themes of electric and acoustic (guitars and percussion) sounds combined.<BR>Lyrically, we can see some of Peart's most poetic efforts, the best of which can be found within Chain Lightning and The Pass.<BR>I would recommend Presto to anyone who loves music and would add that it is worlds apart from the lacklustre Test For Echo - an album that sounds more like a demo than the finished product and is, in my opinion, the weakest album in the Rush cataloge; although it does boast at least six excellent songs but that's another story!<BR>The magic of Presto lies in the midnight winter atmosphere it evokes and the finely air brushed production helps shape and define these cool, diamond like songs.
B00003CXTG|4.0|If you can let yourself be entertained, this movie is exciting and beautifully done. If you have a decent home theater, you will find the effects (both sound and picture) are superb. I particularly liked the fact that facts were assembled from living witnesses and woven into the story. That added lots of interesting detail. Ok, the romance part of the plot was sappy and somewhat shallow. It wasn't that bad and was carried easily by the action and effects.
B000001EAQ|5.0|This album was U2 in an experimental mode.No other band with U2's credentials,with a reputation like U2's on the line,would have the [guts] to put this kind of an album out.As Bono had said,this album was made at a time when rock-n-roll had gotten very dull and boring,very \\"long in the tooth\\".Grunge was down to it's last breath,and people were looking for something interesting.U2 was working with a famous British DJ(Howie B)trying to create something interesting,an alternative to the \\"alternative\\" rock that radio programmers were trying to spoon feed an audience that had eaten too much of that type of music.What they came up with was a kind of dance rock on acid that the listener was being allowed to surf on.This album was pigeonholed as \\"techno\\",when in fact it contained some of The Edge's best riffs since Achtung Baby.Unfortunately this album came out ahead of it's time;if it was released now maybe it would have recieved more positive attention.For those people who think that this album was a mistake,I say.....when you are in a band that has the same 4 members 25 yrs. later,has put out as many multi platinum classic albums as U2 has,and are as relevant today as they were a decade ago.........then come talk to me.

B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets was the first album in what I consider to be Metallicas peak creative period.  Starting with this album, then And Justice for All and finally the black album.  The stuff before is raw and full of energy but unpolished and unfocused, while the latter stuff is too polished and pretty much corportate rock.  But this CD is Metallicas best.  Their isn't a major radio darling here like Enter Sandman or One, but it really captures the essence of Metallica.  Battery is so cool it hurts, and Master of Puppets just hits you right away.  Damage INC is a classic as well, heck the whole album is good.  So overall some very inspired playing by Kurt, James, Cliff and Lars, and Master of Puppets is about as good as Metallica,(or heavy metal for that matter) gets.
B00000DQSV|5.0|This is so great. I always loved them and I was so happy to find again the cd. If you like this type of music you'll be in love with this cd.
6305878323|4.0|&quot;Mary Poppins&quot; has been around so long that it is hard to review objectively. I saw the film in the movie theatre in 1980 when I was 14 years old, and all my expectations were surpassed. There is so much to love about it, it's hard to analyze it without evoking sentimental memories of childhood.<BR>While not quite in the same caliber as &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, yet much better than &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, the movie does have irresistable assets: a lovely score, great sets and costumes, as well as infectious acting, singing and dancing by all the leads. The movie itself is somewhat episodic, with no real tension or conflict (unlike the tense and scary scenes of conflict in &quot;Wizard&quot;), and is about 45 minutes too long for contemporary audiences (1960's audiences didn't have short attention spans as they do today, and lumbering musicals could just take their own sweet time). Despite the accolades regarding the film's special effects, some of the blending of live-action and animation is just not on par with Disney's earlier classic &quot;Song of the South&quot; (1946). Even the wires used to fly Mary and her cohorts are sometimes glaringly visible, especially on a great DVD print, not to mention in the movie theater. Perhaps some of these shortcomings caused the film to not receive mention on the AFI's 100 Greatest Films list. Nevertheless, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; is a bona fide Disney classic, with a wonderful message about life and family.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|This is going to be short and to the point. I purchased the soundtrack over 3 weeks before the movie was released in the US and I listen to it once a day while at work. Having seen the movie last night (opening night), I can say that like, The Phantom Menance, this first CD is only a highlight of the various themes found in the music. I'm sure the marketing geniuses at New Line will release a complete soundtrack for those who feel 70 minutes is not enough. As for the individual tracks. The music itself definitley goes with the movie but it also conveys the emotion and the immediacy of what the Fellowship is going through. Specifically, The Bridge at Khazad-Dum. This piece captures the essence musically of the battle with cave troll, orcs, and finally the Balrog. I give it five stars. Can't wait till next year!

B00003CXCQ|5.0|&quot;Snow White&quot; is a gem on DVD, and is a classic for all time. Not only did this film influence every future animated short and feature film, it also was directly responsible for MGM bringing &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; to the screen. All the computer animated wizardry in the world cannot replicate the charm and craftmanship of the detailed animation in this film. Its only weakness is that some of the comedic antics of the dwarfs simply go on for too long. Yet that's a minor complaint about a lush and enjoyable film such as this. Don't think the Wicked Queen isn't scary to young kids- SHE IS (just ask my four-year old niece). Also, I have to say that &quot;Snow White&quot; is more of a liberated heroine than she is given credit for. She uses charm, friendship and negotiation to set up refuge in the dwarf's cottage, yet is old-fashioned enough to still want romance. Too many of Disney's modern animated heroines are just too abrasive for their own good (I know this is not politically correct, but so what?) The DVD transfer is great, but why do we have to wait through endless commercials when we play the disc again, as well as having to sit through the Magic Mirror menu over and over? A small price to pay for such a great product, but still a price!
0441003257|5.0|This book is most likely one of Gaiman's finest works. No matter how many times you have read it, you can always come back and find something new. The story never grows old and the jokes are always amusing.<BR>One thing though, I would not recommend it to those who can't look at life lightly. It does have the capability of being offensive to some. This book looks at theology in a way that reminds me of Dogma by Kevin Smith. On the same subject, American Gods is another along the same lines. If you're the type of person who likes to find the humor in subjects most find serious, you'll love either of these books.
B000002UA9|4.0|Please Please Me was famously recorded in one long session and it sounds like it. Song for song, this is probably the weakest of the Beatles' albums (except for Yellow Submarine), but it's still a very enjoyable listen. What distinguishes it from all the later albums is a total lack of self-consciousness. This is the Beatles as their earliest fans knew them: a raucous, unpolished straight-ahead rock'n'roll band going for one song right on the heels of another, without stopping to bring in a symphony orchestra. This is, essentially, the spirit that the Beatles would try (and fail) to recapture on the ill-fated Get Back/Let It Be project. <br />The album kicks off with I Saw Her Standing There, still one of the greatest rock'n'roll anthems ever recorded, and closes with John's famous raving assault on Twist And Shout. In the middle we have the curiously underrated title track, one of the most gloriously carefree songs of all time. (Why did they stop using that harmonica?) Then there's the Beatles' first single, Love Me Do, a pleasant but less-than-classic affair. The penultimate track, There's A Place, gives us a glimpse of the inner world Lennon would return to four years later on Strawberry Fields Forever. <br />The rest of the album is a mixed lot. George would never sound as young and unbothered again as he does on Chains and Do You Want To Know A Secret, but Paul is as lugubrious as he'll ever get on P.S. I Love You and A Taste Of Honey. Ringo does okay with Boys and his drumming on the first and final tracks is amazing. The star of the show, however, is John. His vocals on Anna, Ask Me Why, and Baby It's You, while falling short of his later heights as a singer, are achingly soulful and haunting, cementing his position for me as the all-time great rock performer. And before you accuse me of bias, allow me to mention that his vocal on Misery is actually pretty poor.
0452282152|5.0|Although classified as a fiction, Girl With A Pearl Earring, exposed me to 17th century Holland and the fine details of Chevalier's people's lives.  The book was interesting, the characters captivating, the settings mesmerizing, and the prose was simply lyrical.  Once I started, I could not stop!  Thank you Ms. Chevalier!

There style of music combines all sorts of genres creating a most pleasant &quot;hybrid&quot; experience to the ears of anyone with any rock music taste.

B00005JKES|5.0|The issue of who owns the pilot and who's allowed to distribute it has been fought over for years, which is why it's not included in this set. But a DVD version of the pilot does exist, and it's not a bootleg and it although it's a Japanese import it works fine on domestic players and is inexpensive. I got mine for twenty bucks from a seller on eBay. It's not perfect, but it's far better than the VHS version. (...)
6305265666|5.0|After all the years of interpreting the fairy tale of Cinderella, here is one rendition that is as it should have been in the beginning. Drew Barrymore gives her best performance as the deprived Cinderella and Andy Tennant is not nearly as charming as a prince as Walt Disney has led us to believe for 20 years. I love the darkness of the film, bringing out the gloominess of the era it was set in. The original costuming designs are true to period and the storyline is addictive. I recommend this film to anyone with a passion for romance.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|I've seen this movie several times and it gets better with each viewing. When I first saw it, I thought &quot;very good movie&quot; but as I see it again and again, the details emerge and this a truly well-written, well photographed and touching story. <br />The performances in this film are terrific - even despite the robot-like acting of Zooey Deschanel. <br />Even though the story seems to have some gaps in it, the dynamic between Fugit/Hudson/Crudup is amazing throughout. Francis MacDormand should have gotten an award just for her multitude of communicative facial experssions. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives one of the best performances and delivers some of the best quotes, &quot;...the only true currency in this bankrupt world is what you share with someone when you're uncool.&quot;  <br />Crowe did an excellent job in selecting the music for this film. It captures the period and does well to capture the emotions of the moments that we get to hear them. What a great feeling it was to watch and listen as the whole band and crew sings &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot; together when the stability of the band is largely in question. Beautiful!!!<br />In all honesty, this has become one of my all time favorite movies. The combination of the love interest and the fantasy of being on tour with a wild rock band as a teenager is magnificent. The characters are rich and realistic and the naivete of our hero (William) makes him that much better. You can do much worse than this film but not much better. A great movie with integrity and passion.
6304618344|4.0|There hasn't been a good action film since this one came out in the summer of 1997. This one was so good and action packed in a brilliant way, that there was nowhere else to go but down. One awful action flick after the other. This film, directed by the brilliant John Woo, has something that few action films have. It has intelligence. Those don't come along too often. John Travolta stars as an FBI agent who's son was killed a few years ago by Castor Troy(played very wickedly by Nicolas Cage). Travolta finally captures Cage and is sent to prison. Travolta then has Cage's face graphed onto his to fool Cage's brother into revealing some information. Well, Cage gets wind of this and soon he escapes with Travolta's face. Still with me?. All of a sudden, our two stars are playing the other. Got it?. The two actors are wonderfully over the top. Their performances are big and flashy and fun. Neither one has ever been more interesting to watch. Then, there's the action. I have never seen action scenes like this before. They are bigger than life. John Woo is a brilliant man. The scenes come off almost like a well choreographed ballet. Their absolutely intoxicating. And, might I add, beautiful, in a very twisted way. It's a non stop crowd pleasing film. Joan Allen co-stars as Travolta's wife. &quot;Lolita&quot; star Dominique Swain portrays Travolta's punkish, angst ridden teen daughter. &quot;Face Off&quot; is a great ride that hasn't been topped yet. Find out why.
6300213501|1.0|Triskelion is quite possibly the worst episode from Star Trek, TOS.  Nothing wrong with that -- they couldn't all be gems, and they weren't.  The later ST-TOS episodes began to get trapped in a rut in which the characters were trapped on planet surfaces and tortured by cruel captors; whereas, in the earlier episodes, the villains were not all one-dimensional.<br />If you enjoy sadomasochistic themes, I suggest you try the much more interesting 3rd-season episode, &quot;The Empath.&quot; And if you're a newcomer to ST-TOS, try &quot;The Cage,&quot; &quot;City on the Edge of Forever,&quot; &quot;Other Side of Paradise,&quot; &quot;Conscience of the King.&quot; Personally I am very fond of the unjustly-maligned &quot;Man Trap.&quot;
B000021Y77|5.0|this movie is simply the best i have ever seen. i am very into film, but this is simply great because of its wonderful story line, a great art direction, and wonderful camera work...all out A++++movie...everyone should have it!
0790729725|4.0|The movie itself stands on its own.  You go to Blockbuster and rent a movie if you want to watch it.  You buy the DVD because it has great picture quality and features.<br />So, my review is about the DVD itself.<br />The first and biggest negative is the fact that it is on two sides of the DVD.  There is nothing more annoying than having to flip the DVD halfway through the movie.  There really isn't much else on there.  For me, seeing a grainy theatrical trailer isn't very exciting.  It gets a 4 only because the film itself is so good.
B00004TDRD|5.0|This 1975 blockbuster by Steven Spielberg became the first real summer blockbuster film. Having grossed about $260 million at the box office, it opened the doors for the epic summer film. Not<BR>many of the films in years since, has been able to equal the sheer brilliance of Jaws. Roy Scheider stars as a local sheriff who's quaint little coastal/tourist town is suddenly in terror as a great white shark begins attacking swimmers at the beach. In<BR>comes Richard Dreyfuss, who plays a shark specialist, who tries to help the sheriff. Robert Shaw is also on hand as a local fisherman who wants to hunt the killer down and kill it once and for all. There are numerous scenes that are classic and incredibly memorable. The shark itself looks undeniably real and is scary as hell. There are scenes that are destined to make your heart beat faster and your pulse to race. Spielberg executes it so well, and gets his actors to deliver such real performances, that it all comes off as very real and believeable. There is nothing more scarier than when it's real and hits close to home. Know what I mean?. This is one of the finest thrillers ever made hands down. It spawned a pretty decent sequel, but then went downhill(fast)with Parts 3 and 4. Jaws is still one of the best movies ever made. Nothing can match the terrifying theme music either. A classic.
B00005RFVL|5.0|Mister Robbie Williams dares singing American standards.<br />Well, he does it his way and it is just perfect. The DVD of his show at the Albert Hall is also great : Robbie is a true entertainer and Americans just love that. He knows how to talk to the audience, to play along with them, to invote co-stars on stage ..
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I rented this film only because a friend of a friend recommended it. I took a gamble...I won.<br />This film grabbed me from the begining and had me hooked till the end. <br />The whole production is fantastic. The cut's in the scenes dealing with the main characters memory loss is just creativily planned out.<br />Great movie, a must see for action and movie fans alike.
0385493622|5.0|It's quite nice book, even though it took me a while to read(not because of it's content, but because of school).  The way it leads you to the solving of the problem makes it extremely interesting.  It really isn't a book about math, it's more of a book about the history of math, which makes it much easier to read. I'd recommend it to anyone who has an open mind on the subject of math.  As i said before, it's quite a nice book.
6304509154|4.0|Is there a better duo to concoct a scary, haunted house ghost story than Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper?. No, I don't think so. There has also been some controversy over who directed what. There are rumors that Spielberg had stepped in and directed some of it himself. I guess we won't really know. Anyways, the movie is about The Freeling family who have moved into a new home into a new housing development that looks like it's in the middle of nowhere. Suddenly, strange things begin to happen. Their not all that bad at first. Then, it starts getting more serious... and dangerous. The family learn their house is haunted and is on top of a burial ground. Isn't that always the way?. Things go from bad to worse when little Carol Anne(wonderfully played by the late Heather 'O' Rourke)is kidnapped by the nasty ghosties and kept in their spiritual world. Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams are on hand as the haunted parents. They give very effective performances. There are numerous scares and classic scenes throughout this rollercoaster ride of a scary movie. The scene with the clown?....oh my god. I still have nightmares. I guarantee you will too. The film is so chilling and scary, you'll have a hard time remembering it's fake cause the film is done so incredibly well. It is, without a doubt, one of the best scary movies of the last 20 years. Right there with \\"Halloween\\" and the original \\"A Nightmare On Elm Street\\". There is also said to be a curse against the film. Dominique Dunne, who played the oldest sister, was murdered by her boyfriend. A few years later Heather 'O' Rourke died from intestinal blockage. It's very, very sad. The film spawned two lackluster sequels that ruined this classic's image. Horror veteran James Karen also stars. See this scary classic tonight!. It's a must!.
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya hasn't changed, and has succeeded in creating another delightful cornucopia of melody.  Again, not for anyone looking for pulse-pumping tempos.  As before, she <BR>sticks to her ear-pleasing tunes, and doesn't disappoint those looking for a way to unwind.
0385501560|2.0|Palahniuk has created some of the most entertaining literary works of the last several years, but misses with Choke.  All of Chuck's novels share nihilistic themes that start small and easy to grasp, only to lead you down a demented plot line full of exciting characters and an eventual plot twist.  This worked well with Fight Club and Invisible Monsters, but seemed tired and well worn with this attempt.  <br />Choke is based on a character that was abused by his single mother at a young age.  Now, through some twisted guilt, he is forced to support her in an expensive medical ward while she rapidly deteriorates.  His minimum wage job at the historical park, Colonial Dunsboro where it is perpetually 1734, does not begin to approach the mounting medical costs.  To find a second source of income our main character (Victor) pretends to choke at every restaurant within 100 mile radius.  Every time Victor does this an innocent bystander is transformed into a \\"hero\\" and this \\"hero\\" seems obliged to give Victor money.  Not only does he get money on the spot, but on the \\"anniversary\\" of the heroic event as well.  The justification behind this is that once a person has saved Victor's life then they're responsible for it and want to help out in any way they can.  Pretty thin if you ask me.  <br />Throughout the book you get a Fight Club feel as Victor attends help sessions for Sexaholics.  The only reason I gave this book more than one star was for a specific chapter where Victor meets a girl at one of these meetings who likes to get fake raped.  Victor tries to meet her needs only to see the event go amusingly awry.<br />What worked in Chuck's other books do not work here.  The inevitable twist is lame and the nihilistic themes were weak.   If you want a good Palahniuk book, I strongly recommend \\"Invisible Monsters\\" and \\"Fight Club\\".  The only readers that will get any level of satisfaction from this book are those who have read Chuck's other three novels and can say; \\"I've read them all\\".
B000002LCI|5.0|One word can describe this album, MAGNIFICENT.<BR>This is truly a masterpiece of art.  I sometimes have trouble deciding if this album is better or &quot;Violator&quot;.  I love them both the same.  DM reached its peak with both of those albums as far as music and lyrics are concerned.  Martin Gore's song writting skills are at its finnest.  David Gahan's voice is compelling. The band had a plan to break through the sound barries of synth-pop and evolve it into a more safisticated dark sound that is very unique.  Powerfull songs like &quot;Little 15&quot;, &quot;Sacred&quot;, and &quot;Agent Orange&quot; along with songs like &quot;Strange Love&quot;, &quot;Never let me down again&quot;, &quot;Behind the wheel&quot; and &quot;Nothing&quot; blow everyone away.  Rose Bowl was never seen the same after the performance of &quot;Never let me down again&quot; at the 101 concert.  Dont forget Martin's melodic voice on &quot;The things you said&quot; and his compelling erotic performance on &quot;I want you now&quot;.  DM is band that revolutionized and blended synth-pop and Goth and produced something magnificent.
B00000ICD9|1.0|This movie is among the worst movies I've ever seen.  It lacks a coherent plot.  The story wanders all over the place without ever getting anywhere. The movie relies on maudlin scenes between the characters.  Unfortunately, the characters are so weak that you don't really care what happens to them.  Save your money.  This movie isn't worth your time.
0780622545|4.0|On the recommendation of Siskel and Ebert, I rented this movie several years ago. I enjoyed it so much, that I purchased it shortly thereafter. Funny thing is, it's the ONLY movie that I have ever purchased. The majority of movies are just mediocre and subsequently never been worth buying.
B00003CXSP|1.0|Silence was a classic book and exceptionally well done movie.  Both the book Hannibal and the movie were a disappointment from beginning to end.  Replacing Foster with Moore is a big reason NOT to make the movie.  It didn't work when there was a new Batman in each film and new kids in each vacation movie so why do it here.  Also, how can Hannibal Lechtor a very well known nut-case walk around in public w/o any sort of plastic surgery.  No one except a washed-up detective recognized him?
B00005BL2A|3.0|Considering the fact that I am a die hard DM fan, this album didnt really do it for me. I do like it but I guess deep down, I was expecting a little more than what was given to me. (...) The music is not very good at all. Its much worse than the music in ULTRA.  I certainly miss Alan Wilder's musical genius. The music is very plain for the most part. I do like the music in \\"Breathe\\" which I think Martin did a fantastic job on. I do like the lyrics in this album and Dave and Martin both do a good job on delivering. I am just a little dissapointed in the music. Songs like Shine, Freelove, Breathe, Comatose, and Dream on are certainly great. \\"The Dead of Night\\" has a very dark and hard edged sound to it that was totaly unexpected from DM. They have showed that they can be hardcore if they want to and pull it off very well. I guess they are really trying for the Gothic sound. This is definatly not my all time favorate DM album, but it did take some time to grow on me.
B00000GJ2B|1.0|I love De Niro movies typically.....that smile of his, his acting potential, which cann go from extreme insanity to totally hilarious actor but this movie, De Niro or not De Niro, my son and I rated a &quot;negative one-halve&quot;.<BR>Every movie my son and I watch, we rate them after as a family thing, if you will, from 1 to 10...............we rated this movie negative one-halve.  The acting was when they were young and little was demanded from him nor demonstrated.  Everyone in the show talked and walked the IQ of about 65.  I guess what I am trying to say is it was very very shallow storyline and the actors showed little to no depth.<BR>Bob :o)
1556154844|5.0|This is really a fantastic book.  It contains hundreds of pages of pratical information you can use to design efficient, reuseable, and debuggable software.  The book cites many research studies to support its points.  Some may say that this book is not useful because it was written before the advent of object oriented software.  I totally disagree with them.  Many of the same concepts are involved in writing good object oriented software, and many programs still exist in C or Fortran.  The book is still as useful as it ever was; though, you will need to supplement it with a book covering object oriented concepts.  I suggest this to veteran and new progammers because the book has information that will help the veteran and has techniques that will get the new programmer off on the right foot.  Take the time to read the whole book because it is all good and none of it is repetative.  All professional programmers should read this book early in their career.  In the long run, it will save time, money, and effort.
B00003CXDD|4.0|A good movie with great actors(Kilmer),good f/x and a good story.<br />The extras are right but the original featurette has a bad quality(maybe tranfered from video tape).<br />Recommend to your friends.
B00005U122|5.0|This is the Portland, Oregon concert. This DVD rocks! I am a true Floydian and Waters fan. I highly recommend it to all Floyd and Waters Fan. Pop it in your DVD and sit back and mellow into the past. A true breathtaking experience and Memoribilia if you went to any of the concerts he performed in. The beeding in and out of visuals is awesome!
B00005JKT8|4.0|Kate and Leopold is a fine movie if you go into the theater with the right expectations. <br />Don't expect a great storyline, logical science, or even complete causality. Don't expect it to be Jane Austen.<br />Kate and Leopold is a pleasant diversion, a place for Meg Ryan to look adorable and romantically helpless. It's a surprising showcase for Hugh Jackman, who pulls off a very respectable English accent and an excellent (for the material) acting performance. It has good (if not necessarily plausible) performances from Liev Schreiber, Bradley Whitford, and Breckin Meyer, and generates an all around feel good atmosphere, where even the lecherous boss comes off as a good man with foibles instead of the usual characatures of the genre.<br />While there is a little bit of depth to the movie, its best enjoyed as a frivolous date movie, so find someone special to take out to it, and get an extra large popcorn to share.
B000002ILG|3.0|Granted. This is not the most essential record out there. But it's not bad either. I myself lean more towards Bon Jovi, Megadeth, and King Diamond. But this record shows that lighter music can have charm too. If you are a strict heavy metal fan, then this record is probably not for you. But there is beauty to be found in this effort. 'Hungry,' 'Lady of the Valley,' and 'Join Our Hands' all carry a nice sound. Also, I do commend this group for not hiding behind excess noise, obscenities, or trite issues. This record is probably not worth a long trip to an expensive 'you name it, we got it' place. But if you are able to find it, pick it up and give it a chance. You may be pleasantly surprised.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|When I saw this movie I fell in love with it, especially the music, and the love and fire you can hear in the two leads.  They may not be seasoned singers but the harmonies they create make my heart swoon (music is definetly my first love, and this is just my type.) The mixing of pop songs into original words and new music with the actor's voices creates a stunning soundtrack that make me want to sing &quot;Spectacular!  Spectacular!&quot; right along with the singers.<br />I recommend seeing the movie first as it adds so much to the soundtrack and vice versa.  One thing in particular I loved about this soundtrack was the fact that it included the songs in their entirety and before they were spliced for the movie.  You get to hear bits and pieces that you've never heard before.  The only downfall is that if there's dialogue in songs and there's a gap in the song for the dialogue, it ends up sounding a little off.  But I'll forgive it because the rest of the CD makes up for it!
B00005QZ7U|3.0|There are many outstanding moments in this jazzed up versionof the Moulin Rogue story but somehow the film as a whole left me unsatisfied.  I had the feeling that it was just too &quot;Australian&quot; and that film musicals should be left up to Hollywood. These were supposed to be French characters, but they looked strictly Aussie.<BR>There is far too much fast cutting and almost subliminal editing in parts.<BR>Some of the sets seem kind of chintzy.<br />Contrary to what many have said, I believe a major flaw was in the casting of Nichole Kidman as the ill-fated prostitute.  She is just not believable to my mind.
B00005U11Z|5.0|Deen Castronovo, new drummer for Journey, could not have been more on the money when he said the moment you hear the opening line to Seperate Ways you will think &quot;Oh, my god...it's Steve Perry with a perm!&quot;  Well, buy this DVD and you will not have to wait very long because Seperate Ways is the opening track and it only gets better from there!  Superior picture and awesome sound quality!  A must have for any AOR, melodic rock fan or just anyone with a superior home theatre system. - Journey For Two
1587990717|5.0|The talent of Dr. Taleb lies in his ability to connect things<BR>that lie in front of our eyes but that we are unable to see <BR>by ourselves. Once we read his text, we wonder why we didn't<BR>think about them before. Very enjoyable read.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|How can an incredible movie not make for an incredible DVD?  Only when it makes two extra-incredible DVDs.  This movie is at the top of my charts, but the abundant extras on the DVD are extraordinary -- exploring the story, the reality, the characters...I've never been so thrilled to go through such a satisfying quantity of extras after seeing the vibrant movie come to life in my living room.  I wish I could give it twice as many stars.
B00005QDW1|1.0|Take another listen.  EVERY single song is just a 15 second verse repeated over and over and over and over again.  All Gwen needed to do was sing one line and the producers took the rest into making it into a 3-4 minute song.  I certainly hope the rest of the band is annoyed - it doesn't sound like they contributed one note here.  I simply can't believe this was allowed to be released.  One song done this way is fun for parties and dancing, but when you get an album full of them it sounds like somebody just wasn't feeling very creative....This should have been released as a single.
6303441378|5.0|My all time favorite Christmas movie.  I love happy endings and the Muppetts are always upbeat.  I already own it but am afraid I will wear it out.  I wish it came on DVD.
B00005QXXO|5.0|Given the huge amount of processing that went into the creation of Kid A and Amnesiac, a live album makes perfect sense.  It's a full length album (at around 40 mins) that feels powerful and vibrant with a big range in styles and texture.  Required for any fan, whether you liked the last two albums or not - a new masterpiece from a band that works musical miracles.
B000006MS3|5.0|This album is as old as I am by now, but still it's one of the most daring, complex, beautiful and highly emotional albums I own. Really lightyears ahead of it's time; &quot;The Dreaming&quot; is without a doubt a true masterpiece. That's, ofcourse, been said more than 50 times by others here, but I just have the feeling that I should contribute something too, because Kate Bush really gets my deepest respect for making this album. Instantly hooked on &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot; and &quot;There Goes A Tenner&quot;, this album demanded my interest, but is was several listens later the other songs kept spooking around in my head too. I do mean SEVERAL listens though, because apart from a few songs, there are only toughies to be found. From my experience, &quot;The Dreaming&quot; and &quot;Get Out Of My House&quot; will scare you off. I hated those songs at first, as well as I couldn't listen to the screaming in &quot;Pull Out The Pin&quot;. Just keep trying, as it suddenly will grow on you and you'll hear the multiple layers of the songs. <br />Every serious lover of music should go out and get this album. A song like &quot;Houdini&quot; should bring tears to your eyes; it's so incredibly well done. As is everything here. It's a must-have product of pure passion and the genious that is Kate Bush. <br />I also wanted to add that I don't understand why everyone keeps saying this album paved the way for &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; on &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot;, as I think they're both totally different albums. &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot; is good, but almost drowns in it's eighties-sound (especially the drums), while &quot;The Dreaming&quot; uses rhythms in a complete different way (listen to &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot; and you'll get my point) and is really 100 times more varied. &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot; just isn't better than &quot;The Dreaming&quot;; maybe for people who are kind of dissapointed that there's really not that much catchyness to be found here; only adventure and stunning beauty. It's without a doubt Kate's best, and I'll keep listening to it until I die.
B00004Y7SF|4.0|This was pretty decent. Christina sang mostly traditional christmas songs with her special style. All of the songs were well done and sounded nice, but I think Christina definitely could've done better.
630341964X|3.0|It is my opinion that this movie was well done.  I thought the cast carried their parts with alacrity and I applaud them for that.  I always enjoy seeing MacCaulay Culkin in a picture--he is such an effortless young actor and yet his talent is monumental.  Edward Herman is a delight as always.  No, I simply don't agree that this is a bad picture.  Hurrah for Richie Rich!
0446604844|3.0|I came across this bestseller thriller by David Baldacci quite accidentally. David is a new writer (for me), my research shows that not only has he an official website (...) where he participates actively with the readers to answer their messages etc. but also that he  has produced a string of best sellers in last 5 years, one of which has been made into a movie.<br />David, in his early 40's has a good writing style, functional and interesting enough with good narrative sans the pomp., concentrating more on action and description rather than on introspection and philosophizing. This book, an action-suspense thriller is of Ludlum genre, and seeing the good job done by David, he can well occupy the niche vacated by Ludlum.<br />It is a taut story with a complex plot is full of non-stop action, and a pace that leaves you breathless.<br />Lee Sawyer, an accomplished FBI agent is investigating a mysterious case of a plane that fell down from the sky has reasons to believe the crash to be an act of sabotage.<br />Sidney Archer, a young attorney with a lovely 2-year-old daughter, and a loving husband Jason, a software geek successfully employed in an IT- giant has a life that one could ask for. One fine day the whole thing comes crashing down with sudden demise of her husband in the plane crash that Lee is investigating. Lee meets her and is sympathetic to her tragic fate.<br />The investigations point to a deadly plot to eliminate an important passenger on the flight, and Jason who never took the flight is alive, but in hiding. Jason is declared a fugitive and the investigators as well as conspirators are hounding Sidney who has accessed some data in Jason's computer. Sidney is on the run and in process has been declared as an accessory.<br />The story narrates the determined investigations by Lee, and the dogged fight by Sidney to unravel the conspiracy and exonerate her husband. In the process, David also unfolds the enormous power and reach of the information technology and computers that are and can transform the future drastically...for good as well as the bad. Though David has made Sidney the central character, to me Lee Sawyer appealed more as the central character.<br />After graduating from the old masters of yesteryears like; Maclean, Wallace, Hailey,Lecarre, Forsyth etc. I had come to depend on the ruling trio of Clancy, Crichton and Grisham. Now I have added a new writer David Baldacci to my list and he seems to be a promising writer who will go places in coming years.
B0000028TN|5.0|This is what I grew up on and it sounds every bit as fresh today as it did then. When friends come around and feel like a toe tap I just put on Brazillian Love Affair. To quote from the title track \\"I found a lover, by the seaside.. with sexy brown skin and ...\\". Up from the sea it arose and ate Rio is another track that really gets me going. This album also features some of the best talent in the Jazz/Latin world, Airto, Flora Purim to name a few. All I can say is go get it and you will not be let down.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Okay, I admit it...I'm thirty-something, and I REALLY like Pink's music.  I mean, let's face it, her voice is wonderful!  I loved most of the songs on &quot;Can't Take Me Home&quot;, and I even love more of the songs on &quot;Missundaztood&quot;. My favorites on this cd are &quot;Don't Let Me Get Me&quot;, &quot;Just Like A Pill&quot;, &quot;18 Wheeler&quot;, &quot;Misery&quot;, &quot;Dear Diary&quot;, &quot;Lonely Girl&quot;, &quot;Numb&quot;, and &quot;My Vietnam&quot;...ohhh forgedda 'bout it, ALL the songs on this cd are good!  Of course, I was awakened by the poignant lyrics in the song &quot;Family Portrait&quot; which I have to say, I admire Pink for singing and putting on this cd.  It's sad, brutally honest, and every parent in this world should listen to these lyrics as if they were sung by their own child.  But thankfully, that's the only song on here that makes me want to cry inside.  The rest are bluesy, jazzy, rock/pop sensations that just make you want to listen to them over, and over, and over, and over.  Get the point?!  Go ahead, buy this cd, you will not be sorry you added it to your collecion.  And to Pink, if you ever read this - Keep up the good work girl! (and take care of that voice of yours, it's Golden!)
B00005R2BG|4.0|I must say being such a metalhead I am, I never thought in all my life that I would like such a movie like this.  Really just because I cant stand musicals, but this one kept me going for some reason, i went on and rented the movie because I heard some people say it was good, and Iv always been a big fan of Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor, as well as John Leguizamo. And wow the stars Nicole and Ewan actually sing, they have such outstanding voices.  Give this movie a chance its actually well worth it, and what is really outstanding is the layout, the scenory, maybe the best picture of the year as well.  If you dont even like the film, its worth watching just to look at the background of the beautiful perfect city as well as the night time sky, enjoy it and give it a better chance.  Personally I dont think anyone should hate this movie, if you do, try to watch it again.
B000002UAX|5.0|This,in my opinion,is the best Beatles album for many reasons. One being that this album went in quite a few different directions with all four making many eclectic and even abstract contributions. Another being that The Beatles went ahead and made this a double album despite their producer George Martin almost begging them to release it as a single album.  This album has so many great Beatles tunes it would take alot of time to go through each one so i'll say(in my opinion)which are the best songs on the album:  CD 1: Back in the USSR/Dear Prudence/While my guitar gently weeps/Happiness is a warm gun/blackbird/piggies/Don't pass me by/I will/Julia              CD 2: Birthday/Yer Blues/Every body's got something to hide(except me and my monkey)/Sexy Sadie/Helter Skelter/Savory Truffle/Cry baby cry. As you can see there are quite alot of great songs on this album so i urge every Bealtes fan to check out this great album!!
B00005U2LM|5.0|Wu-Tang is back on top. Masta Killa has peaked as a major contender next to Meth, Ghost and Rae. I need more GZA!!!! RZA's beats are blazin. The whole thing is good stuff. Good job. True fans need more of this. Stay grungy! Word.
B00003CXZ4|1.0|Everybody I know, who has seen this movie, loved it.  I absolutely hated it.  I thought it totally sucked.  It was difficult to follow, but that's not why I dislike it so much.  I found it to be really stupid.  The story line is lame, the characters are under-developed, and it is very unrealistic.  I mean, jeeze, does anyone really believe that you can give yourself a tattoo with a syringe and some ink from a bic pen that is perfectly legible and looks professionally done?  Also, when one gets a tattoo, doesn't it take longer than a few hours for the skin to heal and return to normal?  WEAK !!  None of the characters in this movie are worth caring about at all.<BR>Don't waste your time or your money on this one.
B00005RDAF|4.0|Britney's DVDs are always so good to watch, 'cos she's very pretty, dances very well and she's really amazing when it comes to live performances.<br />This DVD, &quot;The Videos&quot;, had everything to be a 5-stars DVD, but as someone else said before, you can't name a DVD &quot;The Videos&quot; if you have only three videos on it...It would be way cheaper to record it all from the TV and that's it.<br />I still hope that someday i'll watch in a DVD the videos for &quot;Born To Make You Happy&quot; and &quot;From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart&quot;. I'm sick of watchin' em on my computer.<br />As i'm one of those crazy Britney's fans, i bought this DVD, and i have no regrets. After all, it's Britney on its cover.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|I tried two times to get through this movie and fell asleep both times.  The opening scene is by far the best part of the movie - It is all downhill from there.  Who's bright idea was it for Angelina to talk with an accent?  Accents are not easily faked!!!  There is no plot - just a lot of focusing on Angelina's great body, which if you are a guy - that's not a problem!!!!  Angelina has several other movies that are more worth the time!!!
B000002ACR|5.0|..just mean (folk) rock albums. A splendid, almost peerless, quality CD with great well-arranged songs, usually accompanied by the Byrds special 12-string, with among the best vocals and harmonies ever! Yes, I bought this one in the late 60's. Time has not lowered this record's (CD) appeal.The best here are &quot;Thoughts and Words&quot;, &quot;Everybody's Been Burned&quot;, an outstanding ballad, and &quot;Have You seen her Face?&quot;  The rest are all outstanding too, except for &quot;Mind Gardens&quot;, maybe an experiment which, thankfully, is the only dud here. The add- ons, &quot;It Happens Each Day&quot;, and &quot;Don't Make Waves&quot; tilt toward the cowboy/western sound that came afterwards, and are worth a listen. And &quot;Lady Friend&quot; is a great addition, a song among the Byrds' rarities,before it's inclusion here. In sum, a 34 year old recording that easily compares with the usual names on all the lists!
B00005OWIU|5.0|I fell in love with the music from Harry Potter without even seeing the movie, just from listening to the trailers when my roomate watched Television.  The score is so subtle and yet it defines fantasy.  The first time I heard it in full, I had to stop and catch my breath, it made my heart soar and weep in turns.  I was not at all surprised to find out that the composer was John Williams.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I watched this movie while I was vacationing in Florida with friends.  We had no expectations upon entering the theatre and were so completely blown away that we saw the movie again three weeks later.  I do not go to the movie theatre often and this movie was truly exceptional.  I was so taken by the movie I talked a friend into seeing it (for me a third time).  He in turn took his sister and best friend for a second viewing.  Nicole Kidman shocked and surprised me with her incredible talent.  This is a DVD that will certainly be viewed more than once.
B000002KDZ|5.0|Very nice work from some great musicians in this album. The song &quot;Nena&quot; shows it all, great horn section with one of the best in Luis Casca a one time Janis Jopin band member. The percussion work is a recorded treasure and a lesson for all percussionist. With the Coke Escovedo and conguero Raul Rekow of Santana fame, Jorge and Abel Zarate's guitar work is very nice and dont compare it to Carlos because he is Jorge not Carlos. Arcelio's vocals are clean and with his Puerto Rican style spices this band just fine. You can get all of this and more in the Best of Malo but any true fan will have this one also.
B000000OAL|5.0|Queen's break into the music world was a quiet one. Even though they were already working together for over two years, and were fairly successful as a live act, they haven't yet made their break in the record business. The one single they released, 'Keep Yourself Alive', never charted in the UK; neiter did 'I Can Hear Music' released under the name Larry Lurex, or 'Earth', released two years earlier by the band Smile (consisting of Queen members Brian May and Roger Taylor, and lead vocalist Tim Staffell). In an unusual and bold move, Queen chose to release an album before having a charting single to promote it. The album did rather well, but didn't create much of a fuss either; it charted at number 24 in the UK and 83 in the US, and was awarded a gold record. Quite an impressive fit; after all, it had some tough competition. It was released in 1973, a year in which classics like Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side Of The Moon', Deep Purple's 'Machine Head' and Bowie's 'Ziggy Stardust' were dominating the charts.<br />It would take Queen two more years and three more albums to release their first chart-topping album and single and base their stand as a supergroup. Retrospectively, though, listening to their debut album reveals great talent and promise at this very early stage of their career. The 'Queen Sound' isn't quite there yet, and the songwriting still needs some polishing; but musically it's one of their best. Instrumentaly, it's already clear that Queen were one of the best bands to appear in several years. Brian's guitar was and remains one of the finest, though his style wasn't yet very developed; drummer Roger Taylor supplied a fantastic, solid beat, and John Deacon (called Deacon John for some reason) gave a heavy, powerful bass. And most importantly, Freddie Mercury's voice, one of the most beautiful in rock music.<br />The album's weaknesses, of course, are quite clear. The unique sound and style that made 'Sheer Heart Attack' and 'A Night At The Opera' is still very vague, and is only hinted on songs like 'My Fairy King'. The production values are very low, making some of the songs sound pretty bad. The remastering fixed most of the problems, but not all of them, like the drum sound. More importantly, there is a lack of teamwork here. Brian and Roger are still Smile, Freddie does his own stuff, and John is hardly a member of the band. The songs, though, make up for that. Unlike most of Queen's albums, this debut is purely rock, and is greatly influenced by the heavy metal and psychedelic rock masters of the late 60s. Brian's wonderful heavy rocker 'Son And Daughter' has a lot of Hendrix in it, and the lighter 'Keep Yourself Alive' shows some signs of Led Zeppelin, as does Roger Taylor's brief 'Modern Times Rock n' Roll'. Freddie wrote 'Great King Rat', one of his very few real rockers, and more importantly 'Liar', a rock epic which remains one of Queen's finest songs. Other standouts are 'Doin' All Right', a fantastic remake of a Smile song written by May and Staffell, and 'The Night Comes Down', a half folk-rock, half psychedelic tribute to the love generation. One of my favorite moments in Queen's recording career is the sudden move from Brian's nostalgic, 60s sounding 'The Night Comes Down' to Roger's 'Modern Times Rock n' Roll'.<br />A fantastic debut album all around, a standout in Queen's career, even if it is slightly rough around the edges. A great album to be enjoyed by all rock fans, and worth the purchase if only for the brilliance of 'Liar'. It's great. Buy it.
B000002BUY|5.0|this is incubus's best cd and the best metal cd i own. this is real different from their new more slow stuff(their new stuff is still good). you can listen to this cd from start to finsh only skipping track 6, which has no singing, and listen to the cd over and over again. if you want to get any incubus cd get this one, and if you want a great cd that is kind of like this get snot &quot;get some&quot;.
B00005R2BG|5.0|This story is for only those of us that can understand the beauty of love, and feel that nothing is more important in life than being with the person you love, against all odds. I've heard it said that this movie offers a very thin plot. I will say that the music and emotions (and the love) of the characters is often more prominent than anything else...but what is more important in a movie...heart, feeling, and emotion, with a great story backing it up (Camille), or an exciting plot? <br />   The story is actually based on one of the most tender love stories ever told, which must explain the timeless quality of it.  If you remember Greta Garbo in her most famous film, &quot;Camille&quot;, then you will openly embrace Nicole Kidman in this film. For she is timelessly beautiful, gives a bravura performance, and manages to re-define what it means to have glamour. She is glamorous in a new way, as Greta Garbo was in her day.<br />There is but one worthy oscar winner this year...it is not Julianne Moore, whose role in Hannibal was completely without emotion. It is not the star of Bridget Jones Diary...obviously.. It is the star who gave a full dramatic performance that harkened to the golden days of glamour and beauty...Nicole Kidman!<br />  The music in Moulin Rouge is very affecting and brings us closer to the hearts of the stars that grace the film. I've heard some say the film is too sentimental and melodramatic.. That is not true, for a film that is not at all sentimental is not a film I want to see! I want to see movies like Moulin Rouge, that know exactly what love is about.<br />  BTW, Ewan McGregor was also stunning in his role as Christian..
0446677450|3.0|Redundant but interesting, Kiyosaki gets the point accross to the reader.....many times.  However, I found most of what he said quite interesting and realistic, about building assets and what not.  it's a good read for those who want to learn the games of the rich or just to laugh.
B00005R87Q|5.0|If you liked Gone in 60 Seconds, you'll absolutly love The Fast And The Furious.  This movies got it all: hot chicks, buff guys, and lightning fast cars.  Ohh what I would do for one of those cars. Anyway, this movies got it all, for the older viewing audiance that is. I deffinatly reccomend buying it right away.  Don't wait to rent it, because you'll only want to end up buying it.
0793518326|1.0|An unrivaled work, despite slight errors throughout.  HOWEVER, it is unusable for playing (are you listening, publisher Hal Leonard?).  I had the humiliating experience of being asked to leave a major photocopying chain for making enlarged copies - copyright infringement.  Musicians, buy the book only if you want expensive filler for your bookshelf.
6305127638|5.0|And the only hope for the federations survival lies upon Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), and &quot;The Next Generation&quot; crew. The sequel to the popular TNG episode &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot; has Picard take his revenge on the Borg(a half-organic and half machine race) who once assimulated him into Locutis of Borg. Led by the evil Borg Queen(played by the beautiful Alice Kridge), the Borg plan to assimilate Earth in the late 21st century. This is around the time where Zefram Cochrane (James Cromwell) and his assistant Lily Sloan (Alfre Woodard) plan to make the first warp drive experiment leading to first contact with an alien race(well, lets just say its a very special Star Trek moment). While this movie does borrow from some scary sci-fi films like &quot;Aliens&quot; or &quot;The Terminator,&quot; it does show that &quot;The Next Generation&quot; can handle the big screen by themselves. A truly great entry in the Star Trek films. Bravo TNG!!!
0440219078|4.0|I thought the giver was a great book. It was neatly written, and had a nice plot. It seemed that there was always something interesting happening, that made me want to read it more and more. The one part I thought that could change to make it better, was that the giver could be something cooler, that could capture everyone's attention. The one part I didn't like, was when I finished the book, because I didn't have anymore good books to read.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I thought this CD rocked. It does not sound like Pop or britney spears like those other reviews tried to say. In fact, it is VERY alternative and ska. It has a lot of different sounds in it but mostly ska,reggae, and alternative. I must admit, I wasn't expecting much from this album when i bought it but it has easily become my favorite album by NO Doubt. It IS a different from other NO Doubt albums but so was &quot;return of saturn&quot;---and every other album. They change their sound every album they make. So for all you people complaining about how it doesn't sound like No Doubt---you need to listen a little closer <BR>because it sounds more like NO Doubt than ever!<BR>   Also, you can still see the influence of Gwen and Gavin's relationship on the songs. She just doesn't come out and say it as clearly as she did in &quot;return of saturn&quot;. My favorite tracks are &quot;Underneath it all&quot;,&quot;In my head&quot;, and &quot;Rock Steady&quot;. I gave this album 5 stars and i mean it. This is a great album!!!
B00005QZWI|5.0|With the movie fresh in my mind from watching the midnight premiere, I'm still moved to tears listening to &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot;. A wonderful compliment to the movie, the score is both musically &quot;comfortable&quot; and intelligently modern in its sensibilities.
B00003CXTG|3.0|Don't expect to see the historical value of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor as it was portrayed in the Classic Movie &quot;Tora Tora Tora&quot;. This is a romance story that eventually gets around to Pearl. After viewing on VHS and having to change the tape to see the second half I feel that the editor could have done something to get to the point somewhere. This was a true dissapointment if you are seeking a real shoot-em-up action packed movie. It does portray the events well but is also a full length feature romance.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix. When anybody hears that word they would usually think of Keanu Reeves in a trench coat bending over backwards as  bullets graze inches over him in slow motion, or Carrie-Ann Moss suspened in a kick in mid air while the camera spins 180 degrees around her. These two things are some of what made the greatest movie of the millenium, the Matrix. The funny thing about this movie is how I didn't have any desire to see it when it came out, it just never caught my eye. I regret every bit of that. I never saw this movie in the theater. The first time I saw was on the little six inch screen in my friends van. Although the soung was coming out of two little speakers and the screen was about 300 times smaller than that of the one in my local movie theater, I was still more immerssed, more blown away, and more impressed than I had ever been by a movie before in my whole life. Everything about it was perfect, the story was amazing, Keanu Reeves easily put on his best performance to date, and the action/kung-fu scenes just blew me away.<br />The story is not something I should tell, although nearly everyone has seen the movie, I bet there is still one reader out there who hasn't yet experianced the total awesomness of this movie.  The story is exactly what sci-fi story should be.  Science fiction is the one genre where the rules of reality cannot hold the writer back, allowing them to just let their imaginations run wild.  That is exactly what the Wachowski Brothers did, they applied every element needed to make not just a great science fiction story, but an all around amazing movie.<br />The Matrix will be looked one of the greatest movie achievements ever.  It went beyond the limits of any movie, went where no movie had gone before, the Wachowski Bros. dared to mess with our minds, and the result was amazing.  You must see this movie.
039492472X|5.0|Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator<BR>Visit Willy Wonka's Wondrous World Again!<BR>* * * * *  (5 Stars)<BR> I chose this book because when I looked at the cover I thought it was cool.  The cover shows and elevator flying up in space, so I thought it would be about space and cool inventions.  The book wasn't like that at all.  It was about Mr. Wonka, a man who owns a chocolate factory, and Charlie, a kid who will be getting the chocolate factory, and Charlie's family.  They go into space and help people from dying and as a reward having a party.  Since the book was different from the cover, I do like what's in the book better than the cover and the idea of the cover.  <br /> Mr. Wonka, Charlie and Charlie's family got into an elevator and ended up in space.  They stayed in a Space Hotel for a day and later had to save it from space aliens.  This book is for children 8 - 10.  I couldn't put this book down.  It is a great way of using your imagination.  This fantasy is written by Roahld Dauhl.  <br /> I liked imagining what aliens looked like, and how they saved the space hotel.  <br /> You'll miss out if you don't read this book!
B00003CXFV|1.0|Let's start with Julia Roberts.  Let's face it, she is a hack actress.  But she is a &quot;star&quot; and she puts butts in the seats.  Only 30 plus women admire her and buy tickets.  Let's see, an Oscar for being another one of her usual on screen loud bombastic characters?  Given that her character was one of today's PCims's most popular--the struggling single mother, I can see why she won.  That isn't merit!<br />More disappointing was the brilliant director Steven Soderbrugh.  What cinematic genius when he made stuff like &quot;Kafka&quot; &quot;Sex, Lies, and Videotape&quot; to name a few.  I am a fan.  But now he has become a Hollywood sell out.  Like this made for TV crap with &quot;stars&quot; in it, and now &quot;Ocean's 16 or Whatever.&quot;
0671510991|4.0|I will assume if you are looking at this book and reading reviews about it, you are probably pretty smart.  Good, you are going to need it.  This is a heavy read and requires immense concentration to get a lot out of it - this isn't night table reading.  <br />That said the book and the information it gives out is really fantastic.  His cold war analysis is sensational, as well as his ability to dissect the motivations and histories of countries involved in different disputes.  For instance, he is able to lay forth a compelling case for the conduct of Germany prior to WWI.  He goes throught the history of the Balkans and the historical strategic aims of each primary world power.  If you love history and geo politics, you definetly need to pick up this book.  But, just don't read it lying down.
B00005BCPC|1.0|Unfortunately, this version of Mansfield Park hardly resembles Jane Austen's book, both in tone and in content.  The issue of slavery was never addressed in the book and distracts from the storyline of the poor relation (Fanny) living with wealthy and mostly unkind relatives, with the exception of Edmund.  Fanny's morality toward slavery is overpowering to the central theme and horribly overdone. Especially the scene where she views the upsetting drawings by the eldest brother depicting the anguish of slaves.  Since when was the brother an artist??  Lame, Lame, Lame... Mansfield Park is not one of my favorite of Austen's novels and I was hoping that the screenplay might take a view that I had not divined from the book..It DOES, but one that is wholly an invention of the screenwriter.  Sadly, it is not even a rich, costume film, which we have come to expect from these period pieces.  Dont waste your time.
068484267X|4.0|First, I liked this book a lot.  Now that I've got that over with, let me tell you that the laughter to tear ratio for this book is about 1 to 4.  Remember Grapes Of Wrath from High School?  This is much sadder in parts.  I always have at least one book with me when I travel and this one was the right size as well as being about the Irish.  (I am of Irish descent, so that alone is enough to interest me.)  I usually avoid the most popular books - I guess I'm not a joiner.  But when I saw this in paperback, I figured it was time.  This book goes a long way to enforce the misconception that every Irish mail is a potentially unemployed alcoholic.  And that they have such large families to make up for the fact that so many children die.  Sometimes it seemed they had children dropping like flies.  I was in a plane at 30,000 feet at abbout 11 PM reading about another child having died, with tears rolling down my face.  If you are looking for a good emotional catharsis, this might work for you.  It is certainly cheaper than an hour with a psychiatrist.
B00005U2LM|4.0|I'm a true Wu-head. I've managed to collect all of Wu-tang's CDs, solo adventures including U-God's wack sh!t. Iron Flag reaches out and pulls you into a hipnotic Wu-state of mind until the last track ends. I was highly pleased by the out come of this CD. Being that radio in ATL didn't play any singles before it's release, so this was a complete blind purchase for me. But I'm a Wu-head, I don't need to hear a track when the Wu gets together. You just grab it!<br />Other than the stale ryhmes U-God continues to spitt,  The Wu Gambinos step up to the plate bashing flamable homeruns with every verse. The 4th quarter of the year is mostly reserved for the &quot;big dogs&quot; to release thier music on the market. This one fits in the top 10 of all releases in the 4th quarter. The Wu needed this one to stifle some doubters. <BR> <BR>oh yeah,....check out Nas new one. much better than his last 2 releases<br />oNe
6304143184|5.0|This is a film beyond any words.  It is simply the most wonderful fantasy film of all time.  Anyone thinking differently hasn't really searched his/her heart to see all the wonderous moments.  Beautiful visually, the soundtrack is out of this world and a story which is timeless.  I can't wait for the re-release in March where a whole new generation can see it for the first time in a theater, and the old-timers can experience the wonder all over again.  I also can wait until it comes out on DVD with additional scenes, etc.  A GREAT FILM FOREVER!!!!!!
630516889X|5.0|First DVD bought and with home theatre and large screen 16:9 tv, it is great.It is not dated inspite of its 80's release. Color and sound are execellent. Action is almost no-stop. The Predator character is truly a masterpiece of special effects. Certainly the plot is believable and list of players (including the now governor, Jesse Ventura) are cast perfectly. Arnold of course steals the picture and shows what &quot;brung him&quot; to tinseltown, his muscles and stamina. Ending is or should be a classic!
B00005U2LM|5.0|After two sub par releases, the Wu get back to the basics with hard production and ill lyrics on &quot;Iron Flag&quot;. Forget Outkast, the Wu proves that they are the best rap group ever. <BR>The hottest song is &quot;Y'all Been Warned, every Clan member shines on there. Other joints include, &quot;Back in the Game&quot;, &quot;Babies&quot;, &quot;Radioactive&quot;, &quot;In the Hood&quot;, and &quot;The Uzi&quot;.<BR>My favorite Wu members are Method Man, Ghostface, and Inspectah Deck, but everyone puts it down with the lyrics on Iron Flag. Every Wu fan needs this album.
B00005R87Q|1.0|As one viewer said &quot;did not expect much, got less&quot; If you are a baby boomer completely forget this movie. It is full of idiotic racing scenes in city that must have been evacuated for anthrax scare to have been possible. ridiculous  Plot has the usual good guy and girl mixture with redeming bad guy thrown in. Must commend film on low level of vulgar language and indecency . Young viewers( 12-21) only.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I was not immediately taken with this film but after repeated viewings I have become a huge fan. The cinematography is dazzling. Russel Crowe is perfectly cast. The script is well written. To the reviewers below who have pointed to the historical inaccuracies, I simply say..this IS NOT a documentary. Many good films about ancient Rome have taken artistic license to make themselves entertaining. Even PBS' &quot;I Claudius&quot; took such liberties. The imagination required to create a spectacle like Gladiator is justification enough to watch and enjoy. Historical accuracy be damned.<br />In addition to the many other merits of this film the action sequences are riveting though quite graphic.
0515127485|1.0|I write this review as (1) someone who loved _Fatherland_, (2) teaches Russian history professionally, (3) has lived and studied in Russia many times since the late '80s.  And I hated this book beyond belief.<br />To explain why would take a small novel to begin with, and I'd give away whatever lame excuse for suspense Harris's writing contains.  I'll stick with three things.<br />First, the excitement of the novel is based largely on the fact that a secret has been kept from Stalin's death in 1953 till the mid-1990s, when a British historian of the USSR happens to stumble across it.  The secret's location happens to be the Russian city of Archangel -- which, as it happens, is the last word screamed out (in the novel) by Lavrentii Beria, the secret police chief who's killed shortly after Stalin's death (in real life) and goes to his grave knowing where the novel's secret is kept.  The word \\"Archangel\\" is supposedly baffling to Beria's interrogators, and no one connects it with the actual city.  The problem here is that, as anyone who's taken 2 weeks of freshman Russian knows, the Russian word for the city is \\"Arkhangelsk,\\" while the word for archangel is \\"arkhangel.\\"  So no Russian would be confused by Beria's last words.  The fact that Harris makes so much out of this linguistic confusion shows that he doesn't know nearly as much about Russia as he does about Germany.<br />(...)_.<br />Thirdly, Fluke Kelso -- the British historian who serves as the main character -- is totally unappealing.  Harris has created the most boring, cliched, unlikeable picture of an academic imaginable: hard-drinking, womanizing (is there a novel anywhere that doesn't depict a professor sleeping with his students?), and self-absorbed.  One of _Fatherland_'s greatest strengths was that Xavier March was (like Arkady Renko in _Gorky Park_, a novel _Archangel_ falls far short of) a tremendously appealing character that you'd have to be inhuman not to empathize with.  As far as I'm concerned, Kelso could get a bullet in the back of the head, and I wouldn't bat an eyelid.<br />So I hope Harris's next novel is truer to the _Fatherland_ mold.  _Archangel_ is bad beyond conception.Kelso could get a bullet in the back of the head, and I wouldn't bat an eyelid.<br />So I hope Harris's next novel is truer to the _Fatherland_ mold.  _Archangel_ is bad beyond conception.
B00005LOUP|3.0|Basketball commentator Dick Vitale uses the term &quot;Dow Joneser&quot; to describe a player whose game is up and down, and never consistent.  It is the same way with this film.  It is good, even terrific, in spots, and in other places, it borders on awful.<br />The fault for this movie's inconsistency lies squarely with the editing.  The best evidence of this is found in the deleted scenes that are included with the DVD.  They're all pretty bad.  This would lend creedence to the argument that this film sould have been cut down to 75~80 minutes.  Take out those weak scenes and do a &quot;Dumpit to Crumpit&quot;!  That particular length worked for Disney for many years, and it would have been a good length for this one also.  That would have make the film that much stronger overall.<br />The biggest reason for this inconsistency is that, fundamentally, the film is trying to stretch a 23-minute animated Tv program (which itself was stretched from a 12-minute book), into a full 105-minute feature.  As a result, there are some extremely thin spots.  Some of the crude humor that was thrown in not only detracts from the story, but makes it more unsuitable for the kids who make up a decent-sized chunk of this film's target audience.<br />There are a number of highlights, though.  Jim Carrey does a suprisingly good job as the Grinch, most of the time.  In classic Carrey style, he takes pauses for commentary on various subjects along the way, with various results.  The absolute highlight of the film, which occurs just before he torches the big Christmas tree, is his one-man (one-Grinch?) diatribe on the hideous commercialization of Christmas, much of which is dead-on.  He also delivers the best subtle joke not long after.  As he is leaving Whoville, he vainly tries to catch a cab.  Think Danny Glover here, and you'll get it.<br />The supporting cast is there, and not much more than that.  Their characters are as plastic as their surroundings, except for Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), who is fairly-well written.<br />Overall, this yet-another-attempt-as-a-remake-of-a-classic-Tv-show film does an above-average job as remakes go, but still misses the mark.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|this film is a 5.  It is an empty and shallow piece of work decorated with pretty flashy images.  I will be disappointed in the academy for the first time ever if they nominate this film for any categories other than technical accomplishments.  Put your visual abilities to use on a piece of drama that is worthy of your talent Baz Luhrman!
B00005QW4K|4.0|Ok First off, Let me just say this. I LOVED Army Of Darkness. It was witty, funny, action packed, and a gold mine of great one-liners! However, This \\"official Bootleg\\"(an official bootleg, that still cracks me up!) could have been better. First off, Captions. No, I am not deaf, but sometimes I have a hard time understanding what Bruce is saying(mabye I should turn down the Pantera!) So I like to watch movies with the captions on. Also, the commentary was OK at best. But the worst thing about this DVD has got to be the new ending. Now I did like it, but wasn't it just a little depressing? Also, You would think there would be room on here for both endings! The original ending has the BEST one-liner ever!\\"Hail to the king, baby!\\" However, on the plus side, the deleted scenes help the movie make more sense. Also, in the movie itself, they have included several parts of deleted footage It is kind of funny, you can tell when they put in new footage. The quality just goes down the [toilet]. But, whatever. Well, I'm done. In my opinion, The movie was good, but I would buy the regular edition of this movie. But, then again, what do I know, right?
B00005JKGV|4.0|Alot of people who are writing reviews on this film simply don't get it.<br />If you don't like the work of David Lynch, all I want to know is....why do you bother watching his films, and then complaining about them.  Anyone who knows his work knows what to expect, it doesn't always make sense and is far from the norm.<br />But true fans of his, like myself, appreciate his art, even though it is flawed at times, we give him the benefit of the doubt.<br />I'll say what alot of others have said: &quot;If you are a Lynch fan, you'll enjoy this film,if you are not, you probably will come away confused and frustrated.<br />It is a haunting, mellow and truly surreal experience, and in my opinion a very good film.<br />It's hard for me to compare anything to Twin Peaks, which I believe is the greatest work of the 20th Century in pop culture(the TV series, not the movie).  Blue Velvet was also terrific.<br />Lost Highway is a mind blowing trip, and a &quot;thinking man's&quot; movie.  Great performances from Pullman, Arquette, Blake and especially Loggia, who I feel stole the film.<br />I tend to agree with most of the reviewers who believe that the 2nd half of the movie played out Fred's mind.<br />Definitely worth a watch.
B00005K3OT|4.0|This is an overall beautiful film.  There are many strong female performance in &lt;Chocolat&gt;, including Judi Dench and Juliette Binoche.  Johnny Depp does not seem convincing as a wandering Irishman, but this is a minor flaw in a thoughful feel good film.  4.5 stars...
B00005R2M3|3.0|I love Shakira. It just seems to me, that in Spanish, she *was* somebody. In English, she's just another Christina Aguilera or any other blonde singer. Except that this blonde singer is harder to understand than the others. Funny, I'm just learning Spanish and I can understand her Spanish songs much better than her English ones, and English is my native language. The English version of Ojos As (Eyes Like Yours) is catchy, but is much more poetic and beautiful in Spanish. Don't get me wrong, there are some gems on this cd (I absolutely love Suerte) but compared to Dnde estn los ladrnes?, Laundry Service lacks spark.
0345350499|3.0|To begin with, the mists referred to in the title are the mists summoned by the priestesses of the Mother Goddess, the Celtic Diana-Ceridwen, to cover the isle of Avalon and to shield it from the corruptions and hatred of the Christian clergy in an Arthurian England. The oppositions between pagan-Celtic worship of the Goddess and the patriarchalism of the clergy in Christianity are a pronounced part of the novel, and the novel structures itself around the narrative voice of Morgan le Fay, who recounts the story of her life as priestess of Avalon and lover of Arthur, to the effect of creating greater sympathy for the pagan faith that she adheres to. <br />There is no discounting that Marion Zimmer Bradley deserves accolades in her portrayal of Arthurian women as individuals who have a voice of their own, psychologically and socially. Her female characters defy stereotyping in their multiple psychological traits. To name a few, Morgan is both justified lover of Arthur, as well as a justified priestess of Avalon, despite her reputation as a harlot amongst the circles of the clergy and the Christian court; Guinevere is more than just a frail woman seeking for love from both her husband and Lancelot, for intertwined with her fate is also the fate of the rule of Camelot and the predominance of the Christian faith in court. But the real problem with such character portrayals and the depiction of such acute characters lies not so much with their lack of autonomy which Bradley steers clear of more than the absolute anachronism that Bradley falls into. As pertinent to most fantasy and fiction based on a historical world or time period which really existed, in this case, Dark Ages Britain, Bradley does not use the novel to reveal mimetically the mentalities and mindsets of women living in the Dark Ages. Under the novel is a suspected veneer of women in our modern society who are struggling against social mores of sexual and religious discrimination (such as the Wiccans of theDianic tradition persecuted by the fundamentalist Christians, and the anti-feminist backlash). The novel appears to be more of a treatise for modern feminism disguised under a romance plot of paganism, magic and human history and pageantry. <br />Men are, however, portrayed with very little space for depth, and Lancelot and Arthur's characterization are particularly problematic. Lancelot turns into a medieval equivalent of a 'closet' homosexual who confesses his love for Arthur before Morgan le Fay; Arthur becomes nothing more than an indecisive wimp who turns to swear allegiance to Avalon by bearing its holy regalia--the blade of Excalibur and its scabbard--and then betraying it to bear a Christian banner in battle instead of his father's battle banner(the Pendragon's dragon-emblazoned banner) when advised so by Guinevere. The mention of the menage a trois between Lancelot, Arthur and Guinevere starts taking on more homoerotic overtones and it seems to be an implication of a love story or affair between Arthur and Lancelot than between Lancelot and Guinevere. <br />The problems of characterization, coupled with the remarkable slant towards proselytizing a belief system of \\"All the gods are as One\\", do seem to get in the way of an audience's possible whole-hearted enjoyment of the novel without critical intervention. The risk of \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" turning into pure ephemeral vapour is the biggest risk that Bradley possibly has to incur in her attempt to be historically anachronistic and to be unapologetic about it.

0060922583|5.0|After reading this book I threw out my old college physics and physical chemistry books.  This is the type of book that should be REQUIRED reading for everyone beyond 10th grade.  So much of what is still taught in traditional schoolrooms and colleges is based on outdated BELIEFS, not FACTS. Broader reading and understanding of books such as this might lead the way for the next budding Einstein or at the very least lead people to question &quot;common knowledge&quot;.
0671042858|5.0|This book was excellent.  It was the third book I've read by Mr. King and I was very impressed!  Having been lost once in the woods (Eagle River Wisconsin school trip), it scared the h*** out of me, it brought me right back to that personal low point in my life.  The thoughts that go through her head, except the Tom Gordon stuff of course are very real.  You see everything as a potentially harmful animal in this situation (when it gets dark).  I also loved the short &quot;diary&quot; of his son's baseball filled summer at the end.  Brought back great memories (football instead for me, but same idea and atmosphere basically, any sports stories grab my attention).  Not too long so anyone can finish this in a day, a great book to start with from his library!!
B00005R2M3|5.0|I am so surprised by the reviews! I bought this a week or two ago and haven't stopped listening to it since. My only complaints are that there aren't enough individual songs on the CD since she does two of them in english once, and then again in spanish, meaning you're sort of getting two less songs on the CD. My other is that &quot;Ready For The Goodtimes&quot; reminds me of some &quot;not so good 70's or 80's song that I can't quite remember the name of but have already heard way too many times&quot; kind of thing if you know what I mean. I personally am amazed at what I thought was her UNACCENTED english. And I just love &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot;. It does seem like maybe a lot of words are squeezed in so maybe the translation from &quot;ojos assi&quot;(I think that's what it's called in spanish) added more words. I think it's possible that the negative reviews may come from people who have followed her spanish language career because I am relatively new to her and she's just great. If this is a disappointment to them I have just got to run out and get her other CDs because they must be better than anything I've ever heard.
B000002U9W|5.0|Atom Heart Mother is one of the most inventive albums I have ever heard by anyone. Who would have bass, french horns, drums, guitar and keyboards mix together to create a beautiful masterpiece? The title track is truly mind blowing. If and Fat Old Sun are some of Pink Floyd's best acoustic numbers. Summer '68 comes back with the french horns and is another one of my Pink Floyd Songs. I will not lie to you, Alan's Psycadelic Breakfast is not as plasent to listen to but it shows how Pink Floyd developed their sound effects and humor from Syd Barret. I first listened to this after I had discovered Pink Floyd from Meddle to Animals. I couldnt believe how well done this was and it doesn;t get much regocnition. I recommend this for anyone who can appreciate real music
B00003CXXS|3.0|with all the hype JPIII got when it was coming out in the theatres, I was expecting a very good movie, possibly even better than the first.  I was very dissapointed when I saw this movie last night.<br />The plot was probally the worst part of this movie, obviously rushed and thrown together.  First of all, Dr. Grant is convinced way to easy to go BACK to the island as if he never learned about what happened in the first two movies.  Secondly, this movie totally leaves you hanging about the outcome of JPII. Dr. Grant mentions it ONE time in the entire movie, and even when he mentions it, he asks people not to ask him about it (what a way by the writers to get out of actually doing work to try to fit the ending of JP2 into JP3, laziness).  JP3 could have very easily been a movie on its own rather than a sequal because it does not seem to fit into the previous installments.  It kind of fits into the plot of the JP1 but definetely not JP2.  Finally, one very interesting thing about the plot, is that there were only three kills in the entire movie.  The first two kills happened in the beginning and the last one happened in the middle and thats it the rest of the movie involved the characters running from the same big dinosaur and of course, raptors.  In addition to this the little boy that was trapped on the island was there for 8 WEEKS before the other people arrived.  How could you survive even more than a week on an island full of flesh-eating carnivores?  Impossible in my opinion.  In addtion to this, how in the world did they get off the island losing only three people when most of the time they were just sitting around outside talking.  One more thing about the plot, it seems that the writers made up stuff as they went along instead of actually THINKING about what they wanted to do in the movie before they wrote it.  Many times throughout the movie, new situations would be introduced that would have had no relevance to the story line if they had been left out.  But the fact that they introduced them forced the writers to keep talking about it, which made the plot even worse.<br />Now the action sequences.  Other than the first scene on the island, there was no creativity in this movie as far as this goes.  As one reviewer said, just alot of screams, roars and running.  The visual effects themselves were good, as they have always been, but just no creativity in the actual scences.  I won't spend much time on the action portion, because there is not really much to talk about.  If you saw the first two movies, then you basically won't see anything new in this one.<br />JP3 was rushed and no thought was put into making a very good movie.  I kept waiting for something &quot;good&quot; to happen that would make the movie more interesting and enjoyable.  I keep waiting, and waiting and then before I knew it, the movie was over.<br />If it wasn't a couple of scences and definetely the last scences of JP2, I would say that JP3 is the worse movie in this series.  However with JP2 being totally stupid and corny, I do not dare say JP3 is worse than JP2, but it is pretty close.<br />Unless you want to collect the entire JP series, just rent this movie.But the fact that they introduced them forced the writers to keep talking about it, which made the plot even worse.<br />Now the action sequences.

B00005NWM3|4.0|The first time I heard the single &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; was when this guy I like let me listen to it in class, (too much personal info, sorry) before that I hadn't even heard of the band. Well' I heard the song and immediately fell in love. It was very touching to me, and has a catchy beat. Since the first time I listened to it, the song started following me everywhere. Every time I turned on the radio- they were playing it. Every time I turned on MTV- the video was being shown. It was like my calling to buy the CD. Now that I have it- I love it! It's really good. &quot;Never Again&quot; is a wonderful song against domestic violence, and kind of sad (to me at least). One of my favorites on this album is &quot;Woke Up This Morning&quot;- I love the rythim and the words, too. That song always reminds me of something. &quot;Too Bad&quot; is also a very good song with lyrics that seem to speak raw truths. I didn'gt really care that much for the song &quot;Just For&quot;- the lyrics were funny, but I didn't enjoy the beat much. (Sadly, I'm more of a peppy pop person) I really loved &quot;Hollywood&quot; and &quot;Money Bought&quot;- those songs make me laugh. &quot;Where Do I Hide&quot;, &quot;Hangnail&quot;, and &quot;Good Times Gone&quot; are all pretty good songs, too. Overall, Silver Side Up is one of the best rock CDs I have ever heard- right up there with Staind, 3 Doors Down, and Lifehouse. :)
B00003CXE7|5.0|The plot of this movie had the potential of being a very, bloody, gory, stupid, and meaningless movie if it landed in the wrong hands.  Thankfully that didn't happen and Rob Ridley did nothing less than a spectucular job on this movie.<br />The movie starts with the main character, Maximus leading his troops to victory.  After the war, the king tells Maximus that he would perfer that he become king over his son, when he died.  Of course the King's son, Commodus, did not like that and after the king dies, orders Maximus be killed.  Maximus escapes his assilants, is found, and becomes a slave.  As a slave he is forced to fight as a gladitor, and he eventually fights his way to to appearing in the famous Roman colliseum.  He gains the supports of other slaves and even his master, and he vows revenge on the new king, Commodus.<br />The action scenes in this movie were perfect, nothing was overdone or underdone.  There was alot of blood and violence in this movie, but they were ALWAYS in the right place and fit perfectly in the current scence.  Maximus was not a cold-blodded killer, until he was in the &quot;ring&quot;.  In the ring, his skills, ruthlessness and sometimes arrogance were very pleasing to watch.  He knew that no one could beat him even if it was not a fair fight.  And the creator of Gladiator did an excellent job in getting these facts across without actually coming out and saying it.<br />The acting of this movie was also superb.  The two main charatcters played by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix did spectacular jobs with there roles.  Crowe had a very convincing performance assuming the role of Maximus.  Phoenix also did a very good job in betraying the cowardness of Commodus, and also betraying the flat out &quot;jerk&quot; (since I can't use another word) that he is.<br />This movie shows that there are still people out there that can produce quality action movies.  Alot of action movies these days are rushed and thrown together and bombard the audience with meaningless overdone action scenes where they are not appropriate.  Not the case with Gladiator.  This movie is easily in the top 5 of my all time favorites.  I rarely give 5 stars on a review, and usually when I see a very good movie I give it 4 stars as I would feel much better giving a movie 4 stars when it was actually a 4.5 rather than just giving it a 5.  However I did not want to give gladiator just 4 stars because it is much better than that.  If there was one movie I would feel good about giving 5 stars, then Gladiator is it.dience with meaningless overdone action scenes where they are not appropriate.  Not the case with Gladiator.

B0000013GT|5.0|Since their inception, OutKast has yet to release an album that falls short of excellence.  That is an even greater accomplishment when you take into account the fact that they have released a new album every other year since their debut in 1994.  However, in my humble opinion, &quot;ATLiens&quot; (the duo's sophomore effort) is their best collection to date.  <br />When &quot;Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik&quot; dropped OutKast proved that there was hip hop in the South that could hold its own with anything released in the east or west underground.  But they did it with their roots firmly planted in their southern heritage.  The duo could have easily copied that successful formula with their second release.  But instead, Andre stopped smoking and drinking, started wearing a turban, and along with partner Big Boi, declared that the crew was from another world.  The result was &quot;ATLiens.&quot;<br />While there is no denying the southern funk that has been a staple of the OutKast formula, they also took a chance with the concept of the album. It would have been very easy to alienate (no pun intended)some of the fans that made thier debut so successful.  Instead, however, OutKast showed their artistic growth.
0345350499|5.0|&quot;The Mists Of Avalon&quot; isn't simply a novel. It is a world unto itself, a complete fantasy shrouded in themes, morals, and characters so pertinent to modern day society that the balance of these disparate elements seems at once impossible; yet Ms. Bradely has done it in her novel. Five stars simply isn't enough praise.
B00005QK39|5.0|It's sad to find no reviews on this album, considering it as the peak on the evolution of this group, wich was suddenly and sadly interrupted when Fish decided to leave Marillion. Having other excellent albums, like 'Misplaced Childhood' or 'Fugazi', Clutching at straws shows the total engagement between all members in the band. Fish and his deep and emotional lyrics, and the finesse of all the members as well, shows us the great moment they were through.<BR>     If you buy this CD (buy the one with the bonus CD), you will listen what the next album was going to sound like, and you can compare it with 'Seasons End', which has some of the same tracks, but arranged to be played with the new vocalist.<BR>    This is my personal favorite album from this outstanding band.<BR>    You should get it !!!!

B00001U03Q|5.0|Eric Clapton remains as one of the greatest guitar geroes of all. In the 1990's he hailed a impressive comeback to the charts. A feat very few artists from the 70's have ever captured.<br />This collection contains hits from his career in the hard to handle 80's, to his rebound with Tears In Heaven in the 90's. Songs like Change The World, and Blue Eyes Blue from Runaway Bride, are companion songs that fit nicely here.<br />While people still prefer Eric Clapton from his days with The Yardbirds, Cream, and his solo efforts from the 1970's, Clapton Chronicles is a collection worth checking out.
B00005U122|5.0|The audio and video quality of this DVD are top notch.  In my opinion In the Flesh (Live) is up there with the best concert DVDs available from a video production point of view.

I was at the San Francisco concert in June 2000 and thought this DVD really captured my memories the performance well.

B00005B3Z6|4.0|I had seen 'Queer As Folk' in its original cut in the U.K., and I was dutifully impressed by how realistic, breezily fun and uncompromising this series was.  As sexy, glitzy and prettily-cast the American version is, it doesn't have the heart or depth of the British original.<BR>One of the most obvious things the U.K. version develops better is its characters.  The non-chalant and irresponsible Stuart is not as cut and dry as his American counterpart (though I personally find the American Brian to be more attractive), and the multi-dimensional character is served by a more interesting actor.  The hapless character of Vince, with his babbling unease, obsession with 'Doctor Who' and endearing modesty is never hard to watch, and he is played with absolute earnest by Craig Kelly.  Nathan, as played by Charlie Hunnam (late of Fox's 'Undeclared') is a fresh-faced and honest character with a well developed transformation from innocent boy to more worldly young man.  <BR>Without the need to stretch stories out for whole seasons at a time, this miniseries is able to spend just enough time on all the fun and serious moments which comprise the plots of these 8 episodes.  While this series isn't as graphic or as dependent on sex as the Showtime version, it certainly has more than its fair share of controversial situations and characters, and as a result it is a far more daring and relevant production.<BR>The DVDs are a bare-bones presentation of the series, condensing all 8 episodes into 4, and editing some scenes while severely altering the soundtrack into basically a series of generic (read: cheap) dance tracks.  While the original score is left largely untouched, there is no 'Sexy Boy' or 'It's Raining Men' for instance in the C1 version, which is disappointing to say the least, as the songs chosen for the original soundtrack added so much.  There are no extra features of any kind on the DVD - a scene selection menu and subtitles would have been in order at least.<BR>In theend, this is a must-see miniseries, a triumph for television and a tribute not only to the gay lifestyle, but to good old-fashioned smart dialogue and honest characterization.  The skeleton DVD and the annoying C1 edits may diminish things slightly, but not to those who have never seen it before - it's such a compelling and sincerely fun series.  Gritty, frank and unapologetic, the British 'Queer As Folk' is a testament to truth and realism, obscuring nothing but serving to open many eyes.

B00005QK3W|5.0|I've been a McCartney fan since the early sixties. I loved the LP's Ram, Band On The Run and thought that Flaming Pie was brilliant. Now, about Driving Rain. I can't get the songs out of my head. Driving Rain is the most captivating cd I've ever heard. It sneaks up on you and then all of a sudden you're hooked. I hope George Harrison heard &quot;Riding Into Jaipur&quot;. I think of him everytime I hear this song. &quot;About You&quot; is my favorite, but all the songs paint a different picture. Some with bright colors, some with dark. Paul's love for Linda was more than his fans ever understood. It was &quot;Magic&quot;.

From that moment on this man goes on a path of civil rebellion, commenting on it from beyond the grave. This movie show's how important life is, and how much we should treasure it.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I thought this was not by far, but probably the best ever Incubus album.  Don't get me wrong, i love all the others and bought them the second they hit stores.  Many people have said they didn't like this album as much as the Make Yourself or S.C.I.E.N.C.E. because it doesn't rock as hard, but you have to keep in mind that a true Incubus fan has to like more than just the hard energy put toward the music.  You have to also appreciate the well thought out lyrics and how they still show the same energy in more mellow music. That's one of the great talents of Incubus, their expression of energy through even the most mellow of songs, there's always something driving the tempo.  So, even though this album is a little more smoothly composed I'd suggest it to any real Incubus fan.

It shows that your childhood tends to effect your adult hood.
B00005N9CV|3.0|Her latest album continues her slide from her best album, All For You. She is becoming more of a commercial singer, and less of a jazz pianist with every album. As her popularity rises, with each album containing less and less piano, I'm sure she will lose most of her early jazz audience, who contributed to her early success. Bring back the piano!
0736041850|5.0|I am currently studying for my Diploma in Sports Therapy and Health and Fitness and found this book the most educational book I have seen. The illustrations were fantastic, well labled and very informative. I also found this book very encouraging as it is the first book that I have seen that covers the female body in detail as well as the male. This book will never find its way onto my book shelf as it is a book that I find myself constantly refering to. Frederic Delavier must be a very proud man producing such a fine book.
B000001Y5J|5.0|This is arguably the greatest work of NIN. I was tentative to buy this becuase of its brevity--I wanted something that took more time to develope, and how can something take such little time to develope? Well I bought this CD reluctantly, and I must say that \\"broken\\" transcended the high expectations I had for \\"fragile\\" (I had low expectations for \\"broken.\\")<BR>The lyrics are great and the music is even better, giving Trent's words more meaning. But if there's one thing I can't stand, it's people complain that this album doesn't sound broken.<BR>Trent did not call this piece \\"broken\\" because he thinks his own music is broken! What kind of an (...) would ever do that?! He tries to explain his state of depression. He tries to explain what his wretched last few years had done to him. He's \\"26 years and on\\" his \\"way to Hell.\\" He is broken, not the music.
1587990717|4.0|Taleb's discourse on the role of randomness in investing and, more importantly, in performance testing, is an important initial contribution for that small segment within the investment industry that conducts back-testing and attempts to get to the core of performance results.  That the general public understands the wider implications of his conclusions is doubtful, but Taleb isn't targeting his book to those with Plebian tastes. <br />Of particular interest are his attempts to explain the intellectual underpinnings that led to the dreadful result of lumping economics with the hard sciences.  Taleb makes a stab at discussing so may important and interesting topics, but leaves readers hanging on for more.  He only begins to touch on important topics such as behaviorial economics, or the role of &quot;noise&quot; in the marketplace. <br />This book, while a solid tongue-in-cheek primer on the esoteric topic of randomness, begs for a serious follow-up that focuses more on solid examples and recommendations for action, and less on classical name dropping.  Taleb should see a therapist to figure out whether he wants to be a serious classist, or stoop to the level of an intellectually curious, but &quot;bored with money,&quot; investment pro.  Then, on second thought, as Cavafy would say, life is the journey, and I doubt Taleb really wants to arrive in port...
0375431624|4.0|The Kranks have decided to take a cruise this year and just skip Christmas altogether. Is that possible in a neighborhood that holds their plastic Frosty the snowmen hostage till once a year when each and every person on the street climbs up on his roof and lashes him to their chimney?<br />When Luther Krank refuses to take part in the yearly Christmas contest for the most decorated street, he opens a can of worms, and it looks like there is no going back. There will be no office Christmas parties and no big Christmas Eve bash at their house. No lights, no tree, no cards, not a thing to remind them of Christmas.<br />At the last minute their daughter calls to say she is flying home from the Peace Corps to introduce them to her fianc&eacute; and show him a good old-fashioned American Christmas. All of a sudden Christmas is on and the last minute production will have you rolling in your seats. All I can say is thank goodness Scrooge had neighbors.<br />The beginning of this book was irritating and the characters were far from likable but the last 100 pages redeemed the story. It was a fun Christmas read. I read it in two short sittings.
B00005O5CM|5.0|This movie is so fun and cute!  I have to admit, as a blonde, I loved Reese as Elle Woods, the cute, sweet California girl who goes to Harvard and proves them all wrong.  She tries to get her boyfriend back, but in the end she gains so much more. All I can say is this film has GIRL POWER!!
6303282237|4.0|Those of you familiar with Anthony Mann's gritty Westerns (Winchester '73, The Man From Laramie) know that he always pushed the envelope for brutally intense action sequences. In El Cid he again directs one of the fiercest encounters put on film.  It is a scene where the Cid must face the king's champion in a joust to the death. The desperate ferocity and energy that go into this struggle are breath-taking. The graphic gore of today's action films can't begin to compete with the furious athleticism that goes into this fight. Beyond this great scene, the movie is full of sweep and splendor. El Cid is a good man who seeks to bring reconciliation between Moors and Christians. &quot;El Cid&quot; is one of a series of epics produced in Europe during the early '60s by Samuel Bronston (&quot;King of Kings&quot;, the &quot;Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, &quot;55 Days at Peking&quot;). It does slow down at times, but over all it's a sumptuous treat for those who love epics. Sophia Loren is visually stunning, if somewhat wooden, as Chimene, the woman the Cid loves. Anthony Mann was the first director on &quot;Spartacus&quot;, but was fired during filming by Kirk Douglas. Charlton Heston, concurring with Douglas, thought the Mann got lost working on epic films. Be that as it may, Mann turns in a quality work and no one can deny his brilliance in staging close-up action.  Even Heston admits that it is fun think of Mann filming the chariot race in &quot;Ben Hur&quot;.
B00003CXTG|4.0|If you want accuracy well I suggest that you visit your local library. The film is very entertaining with something for everyone, romance, action and excellent special FX. The 3 hours in the cinema went very quickly, it certainly will find it's way into my DVD collection.
B00003CX95|5.0|Well, by now I think everyone has seen Braveheart, but who cares, this movie is one that you can see over an over, it is very good, the acting, the story, the soundtrack, everything is awesome, except the DVD, what a let down, practically nothing, just a commentary, trailers and a little documentary, no featurettes, deleted scenes, alternate ending, talent files, or all the other great special features that make a great DVD. Sure it was not a special edition, but why not, this film deserves one, another letdown by Paramount, like Apocalypse Now Redux, or the Untouchables, great movies, not so great DVD, just the film and a little stuff which is not enough, you see bad movies that get awesome special features, example, MIB, not so good a movie, what a load of special features, but these films, they deserve better, the quality is not such a problem, good sound, good picture, but where are the features, we need the features, the film is worth it though but dot be so lazy. Anyhow, the film is so good it deserves the money.

He was right take a picture of me as a bambino of 10 years, put my Yankee hat on, and my son said from home movies he saw of me---that could have been me riding on the bus with DeNiro. I grew up in the Bronx in the 50's and 60's. This movie never wandered from the truth ---- that was the way it was growing up during the DOO-WOP era in the Bronx. Capra and Chazz gave bravo performances, but DeNiro was still the man. A working class Italian from the neighborhood---his part was small but it was<BR> loaded with TNT as all his performances are. <BR>DeNiro's directing debut was nothing short of excellent. A must see ---- for all ---- extremely entertaining --- and it will keep you in your seat from beginning to end.
B00000J7S8|5.0|Ms. Krall is a world-class jazz pianist who sings with a warm, seductive voice that has extraordinary character. Some people say she \\"over-mic's\\" (sings too close to the mic?), the point being that anyone can pull it off but your better songstresses don't need to. Well, over-mic ME! I love the intimacy; it's like being chin-to-palms, leaning over her Steinway. It all contributes to the breathtaking clarity and gorgeousness of this album.<br />This was the first DK album for me and she showed that it wasn't the \\"standards\\" that were dreary but the singers. What a revelation to hear the Krall treatment of \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" -part of the stock in trade of crooners and croonerettes coasting along on their laurels. I haven't listened to (ugh) rock since. One of my favorites on this or any DK album is the Clint Eastwood-penned \\"Why should I care?\\" Beautiful and exquisite (but not listed on the liner).<br />Disregard the mean reviews. It must be personal. She's blown out of the classic jazz format (which she excels at, BTW, -check her previous four or so albums) and shows she's lots more than that. That must bug purists who think one should dwell in obscurity and cater only to jazz scholars. Maybe she's not perfect --who is?  There's no accounting for tastes and Ms. Krall suits mine better than all the rest, even the \\"legends.\\" Decide for yourselves.
B000000W5L|5.0|Everybody says this is the best Stones album ever.  I disagree, and would put Let It Bleed far and away at the top, Sticky Fingers a distant second, and Exile a close third.  Exile is probably the most interesting and complex Stones album, but for those seeking the pure Stones sound, I think the other two DEFINE it.  That said, the three albums represent the birth and the peak of the modern Stones sound, Let It Bleed being the first to be released after Brian Jones' death.  The Mick Taylor era was when they perfected the sound that they still have today (at least on stage when performing their older tunes).  These three are all 5 star albums by the self-proclaimed (and hard to dispute) Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World.
B00000JCB2|5.0|This is the Bizkit's best CD.'Significant Other' is better than<BR>'Three Dollar Bill Y'all$' and far better than 'Chocolate Starfish and The Hot Dog Flavored Water'.This isn't critising the<BR>other 2 albums,but it's true.Take &quot;Nookie&quot; and compare it to &quot;Boiler&quot; on Chocolate Starfish,&quot;Nookie&quot; is far better and more emotion driven.&quot;Break Stuff&quot; is one of the most aggressive songs ever written,it's great.'Significant Other' is definetely worth buying,cause Fred's not a gangsta-wannabe like on 'Chocolate Starfish and The Hot Dog Flavored Water'(although no songs on that have &quot;gangsta&quot; or &quot;G&quot; in them),but at least with Limp Bizkit you can tell all 3 albums from each other.
B0000009TK|5.0|This material should be heard along with the two companion pieces Broadway the Hardway and Best Band you Never Heard in Your Life. You will own a great set of tunes from Zappa's final tour in 1988 which only lasted for 5 months. The show begins with Stinkfoot and the great new tracks are Yuppies go to Hell, Fire & Chains and Star Wars Won't Work.
B000056PWV|5.0|When Grace Kelly utters that line to James Stewart, she like he has her gaze riveted to the window watching the goings-on across the back courtyard. Now we know that she finally believes his fantastical claim that the seemingly innocuous nearby apartment dweller (pre-Perry Mason Raymond Burr in a white wig)has in fact murdered his nagging invalid wife.<br />Stewart has been laid up for weeks in his apartment with a leg cast, unable to pursue his adventurous life as a daredevil photographer. Bored, he has taken to watching the antics of the apartment dwellers across the way. Things look a little strange about Burr and his now-absent wife, so Stewart's long-dormant imagination takes him into a cat and mouse game with dangerous consequences.<br />I like &quot;Rear Window&quot; quite a lot: the speaking actors are all first-rate, like the aforementioned Stewart and Kelly, and also reliable Thelma Ritter as the visiting nurse who has her own pet theories about where &quot;things&quot; might be buried. Then there's a  pile of non-speaking actors, the pantomine players comprising the apartment dwellers, whose skill makes the whole movie work. Costuming for Grace is great, too; there are numerous occasions for her to spin about in haute couture outfits while trying to tempt the wheelchair bound Stewart away from his voyeuristic habits.<br />If you've ever tried to piece together what the folks across the courtyard from you are doing, whether behind drawn shades or out in plain sight, throw open &quot;Rear Window&quot; and take a peek.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento is the sort of movie that, when reading the DVD case, you really don't know what to make of it. As such, it's also the kind of movie that leaves you scratching your head, pondering what has become of the main character. Of course, there are some plot errors, but it's to be expected with such a different kind of movie. Watch it.
B00004XONN|5.0|I've been a huge fan of Radiohead for about 3 years now. You cannot see this album in the same light that you see The Bends or the legendary Ok Computer. This is a different style of music. It would be the same if some death metal reviewer reviewed a Dr Dre album with a death metal mindset. It just won't work. <BR>This is a new direction for Radiohead. It's not as intense as OK Computer, but that's not a bad thing. It's very relaxing. It's a ballet of music, weaving it's complex web in yor ears. A very well done peice of art work.<BR>I was slightly dissapointed in How To Disappear because, if your a good Radiohead fan, you'll know that How To Disappear is not new. It was never officially released on any albums however it was played live. Only under the title of &quot;How TO Disappear Completely and Never Be Found&quot; I prefer this title. Also the lyrics are changed  a bit. I prefer the old lyrics too.<BR>Most people were/are surprised by this new road. But I am very pleased with it. I think this is a good path for Radiohead to take. I only hope they don't forget The Bends, or OK Computer. <br />A VERY good album. Check out Ideoteque, How To Disappear, and Everything In It's Right Place
B00005Q66T|5.0|This woman never stops. It's crazy to think how successful she has been. &quot;GHV2&quot; is actually her 3rd hits compilation! 3 hit-stuffed retrospectives in less than 20 years is pretty damn good. This one covers all the hits from the nineties that weren't a part of her last hits CD &quot;Something To Remember&quot; (save &quot;Take A Bow&quot;). The track listing speaks for itself. Songs like &quot;Deeper and Deeper,&quot; &quot;Secret,&quot; &quot;Take A Bow,&quot; &quot;Frozen,&quot; &quot;Ray Of Light,&quot; &quot;The Power Of Good-bye,&quot; &quot;Beautiful Stranger,&quot; &quot;Music,&quot; and &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; all still get radio play well after they were originally released. These songs have earned their place as 90's pop classics. Also included are songs that weren't big radio hits but still managed to gain popularity in terms of videos and in mass media, like &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl,&quot; &quot;Drowned World/Substitute For Love,&quot; &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina,&quot; &quot;Bedtime Story,&quot; &quot;Human Nature,&quot; and &quot;Erotica.&quot; This CD truly showcases the roaring 90's in Madonna's career...each track representing some kind of milestone in her career that has brought her above and beyond icon status to this day. It doesn't get any better than this. Pick it up, along with &quot;Something To Remember&quot; and &quot;The Immaculate Collection.&quot;
B00005AAFT|4.0|It's a really good album.  I was a little disappointed that there wasn't any really nice melodic numbers like the other two previous albums had, but it's a sound investment.  My favorite song on the album is &quot;Mein Herz brennt&quot;.  Another couple to check out is &quot;The Bhse Onkelz&quot; and &quot;Die Toten Hosen&quot;.  Deutsch Rock Kicks
B000002AGE|5.0|There's nothing more I can say that hasn't been said in the previous 25 reviews, so I'll keep this one short. One of the most important jazz albums ever, probably the best one in fusing jazz with rock. Ok, so everyone knows 'Birdland' but the rest of the album is also fascinating. Amazing solos by Zawinul and Shorter, which by the way is one of the most lyrical and emotional sax players out there. And of course, there's Jaco, the indisputable master of the fretless bass. Why? Hear for your self.<br />A lot of people seem to dislike this album, considering it a jazz sellout, but don't listen to them. Not everyone can make such great fusion. The production is also pretty slick and done nicely. 'Heavy Weather' is fun and interesting. Also a good place to start with the music of Weather Report.
0345451325|4.0|I am a die-hard PS2 man. I don't plan to get an X box (now if someone wants to GIVE me one...). I don't like military science fiction--Starship Troopers was excrutiating! (I had to read it for a class). I am not a fan of FPS games (I like RPGs & survival Horror and weird stuff). And unlike some of my fellow reviewers, I have never heard of Eric Nylund (sorry Eric).<br />Despite all that, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I read a LOT, and it's rare a book will hang on to me when I have other things to do...this one made me late getting back from lunch because I just had to finish the chapter and kept me up too late, so the kiddies had a tired librarian for storytime.<br />All I'm saying is this is well wrought, fun science fiction. It is WELL worth the tiny price and your time. Comparison to the excellent Hugo/Nebula award-winning Ender's Game is NOT unwarranted. So BUY it already! :-)
0782008372|4.0|Despite the often-mentioned shocking quality of the DVD Picture, it's still a must-buy at this stage, mainly because there's no real alternative. I'll be looking for a better version of this in the future though if it's ever re-released &amp; cleaned up.
B00005QIPH|1.0|Yeah, this is \\"real\\" raw stuff alright. Though I can't speak for the VU's true NYC hype years in the 60s, for the local NY Punk scene 25 years ago, it most certainly *wasn't* about spoiled rich kids from Upper East Side private schools posing as dissillusioned, disaffected, disdainful layabouts. (...) <br />Musically, the word derivative shouldn't be tarnished by it's employment in a critique of these hooky fabrications, whose \\"authenticity\\" is more contrived than the biggest selling Nsync disk. (When leader Julian Casablancas was a mere babe, his pops, John was pushing Disco to Baby Boomers, not as far as I recall, Punk to Punks...). (...) <br />You want \\"real\\" New York? There's dozens upon dozens of amazing, (actual) talented and native bands constantly showcasing their wares in clubs and venues; many of whom don't have the benefit of a well-connected music business father or loaded European parents.
B000000WJZ|5.0|It would only let me pick up to 5 stars out of 5, the person who came up with that idea obviously hasn't heard siamese dream.<BR>This album is the best in history so far....and I doubt I will see it toppled from this position in my lifetime (with Mellon Collie taking number 2).  With the pumpkins its like ultimate extremes, you love em or you hate em, but if you love em, it truly redefines music. <BR>My picks are Cherub Rock, Disarm, Spaceboy, and then there's Mayonaise which is just in an entire leage of its own. This song is beyond description, just listen to it every day without fail for 7 years like i have and you'll see...
B00003CXXS|1.0|This may have been the worst movie I've seen in about two years (and that's saying something because I saw 'Reindeer Games' in the year 2000).<br />I wish I could give a positive to this film.  I guess if I really had to reach, I would say that I didn't have to pay money to view it, as a friend had rented it.<br />Perhaps the worst dialogue in motion picture history...and I could live with that if the effects didn't look like they were created from the team that brought you 'Anaconda' and 'BATS'.<br />It's a giant puppet show, really.  I swear that 3rd Grade kids collaborated on making some of the dinosaurs.<br />No redeeming quality at all.  No characters, no dinosaurs worthy of screen time, another horrible kid actor, a pathetic attempt at a love story, another really dismal sequel.<br />Ten times worse than 'The Lost World'.  Don't waste eighty cents on this complete mess.<br />Take that eighty cents and throw it into a muddy pond...much more exciting.
B00005JHCP|5.0|Those who are familiar with the book obviously they are going to notice that some parts were omitted,but that happends often in a movie  when you have limited time to present the story.<BR>In my opinion this version was well put togheter,it`s very entertaining,delightful, worth getting one to watch and keep.
B00005U2LM|4.0|I was content when Ghostface Killah came out with his &quot;Bulletproof Wallets&quot; but then I hear that the entire Wu-Tang Clan is coming out with a LP soon called &quot;Iron Flag&quot;.  Well I was reluctant to go out and buy it right away due to their last LP together (The W)which was wack to me.  Well I bought it and I am glad I did!!!  This is the Wu-Tang Clan that I remembered!!  This LP is classic RZA production laced with the Clan's style of &quot;dart throwing&quot; aka spittin'lyrics!  The beats are good and the rhymes are rapid just like the old days.  Get this album. But there are draw backs to the LP, the guest spots!!  Flavor Flav and Ronald Isley?!?  What's the deal with that? Plus where is Cappadonna?  Is he still with the Clan? Anyway, with that it can't take anything away from the quality of this album.  The MVP of Iron Flag in my opinion is....RZA for the beats.  He went back to the sampling formula this time around.  The usual suspects like Ghost, Rae, Meth, INS, and GZA holds it down.  U-God and Masta Killah did their thing too!!  So with that get the album it is way better than &quot;The W&quot;, and Wu-Tang is still showing you that they are nothin'to f'wit!!
B0000028W9|5.0|When the air turns cold and the daylight hours diminish, I think of when I became familiar with Leonard Cohen's the Future. One December, my mother, whose love of unconventional, eclectic music I inherited, used Christmas money from my grandparents to expand her CD collection, including the purchase of the Future, an album from which the two best songs of her adored Natural Born Killers soundtrack were taken. I gave the album a few trial listens, as I had always expanded my tastes by waltzing through Mom's tape and CD collection.<br />The Future, however, was much different from the Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin I picked-up from her. To a high school student whose favorite bands were mostly FM radio staples, Cohen sounded dark, sober and distant. The Future's simplistic arrangements, slow pace and Cohen's gritty, tuneless voice made the Future a failure on the scale that I rated Led Zeppelin IV and Hot Rocks as classics. Yet, the brooding articulateness of the album was something I slowly found to be spell-binding. Lines such as \\"Things are going to slide/Slide in all directions/Won't be nothing/Nothing you can measure anymore/The blizzard, the blizzard of the world/Has crossed the threshold/And it has overturned/The order of the soul,\\" had both an immediate impact and an abstraction and complexity about them that made the lyrics mysterious and affecting after several listens, even after memorization. Songs of love and of anger I had heard but the precise lyrics of Cohen, speaking of that disappointed feeling of one who loosens-up in celebration and struggles to find a hand to hold (\\"Closing Time\\"), of desperate patience (\\"Waiting for the Miracle\\") and intellectualized hope (\\"Deocracy\\") were fresh, exotic and intriguing to me. Even the slow-paced music began to engage me, with its sleekness, craftiness and exact appropriateness to the song. All in all, to a high school student whose favorite bands were mostly FM radio staples, Cohen was somebody bizarre and astonishing.<br />He was a musical persona more multifaceted and more vibrant than any other I had known, a writer of consciously futile protest mantras; a desperate romantic always embraced by love to the point of entanglement, a witty old man (three times my age) sitting lonesome at the edge of a bar waiting for someone to pour his wisdom and wry observations into. This was the person I saw as a listened to the Future, relentlessly - with headphones on the bus, driving to my part-time job, alone in my room - always surrounded by cold air, falling snow and the sense of wonderment only a poet can provide. The Future was my introduction to a more cerebral, more mature side of popular music. Even today, after absorbing the Velvet Underground and Nico, Astral Weeks and Blood On the Tracks, I have yet to hear an album that stimulates me in the way the Future does. I am thankful that I discovered Leonard Cohen's best album during that lush, white Pennsylvania winter at the age in which every new discovery in music seemed supernatural.
B00005QDW1|2.0|I can't believe how gimmicky No Doubt has become.  Their ragga dance hall music smells of cheap imitation.  Record stinks.
B00005Q45W|4.0|In October 2001, his adoring legion of fans finally received the third installment of the revamped, synthesizer-infused second phase of rock-poet, Leonard Cohen's career. The nine-year gap between releases can be accredited to Cohen's long stay at a Zen-Buddhist monastery, adopting a life of meditation and reflection. The mind-set of that environment is reflected several ways on Ten New Songs: the secluded recording sessions (Almost all of Cohen's accompaniment comes from back-up vocalist, multi-instrumentalist, cowriter and producer, Sharon Robinson); the ever-placid pace of the music; the spiritual nature of songs like \\"By the Rivers Dark\\" and \\"Love Itself\\" and the album's considerable increase in reflection and introspection. Where on 1988's I'm Your Man and 1992's the Future, Cohen often criticized society, on Ten New Songs the focus has been shifted to the intimate as Cohen evaluates the nature of living on tracks such as \\"Here It Is\\" and \\"A Thousand Kisses Deep\\" and his own role in it on tracks such as \\"Boogie Street\\" and the gorgeous \\"In My Secret Life.\\" Obviously, Cohen had gathered much insight during his retreat from music. Ten New Songs is the distinctive, engaging and deeply inspired follow-up for which we have patiently waited and hoped.
B000002INR|5.0|This is one of the best hair metal albums around! I rate this<BR>with Van Halen's debut!
B000005IU1|4.0|Before Nirvana, before the Misfits, before the Clash, the Sex Pistols, the Ramones and the rest of the so-called first wave of punk rock, the Stooges originally used thrashy rock and roll to epitomize average young angst. It not an overestimation to say that every distressed grunge rocker, raging metal head and disenfranchised punk can trace his or her roots back to the Stooges' eponymous debut, an album that was woefully misplaced in the idealistic, flower power era. With the exception of the faulty artrork endeavor, &quot;We Will Fall,&quot; every moment of the 1969 LP surges with the rage of pent-up, unruly youngsters. Lead singer, Iggy Pop, takes the role of a ...everyman, tunelessly wailing about awkward sex drive (&quot;Not Right&quot; &quot;Real Cool Time&quot;), youthful apathy (&quot;No Fun,&quot; the pounding, perfect anthem &quot;1969&quot;) and misplaced passion (&quot;Ann&quot; &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog,&quot; which is likely the most frighteningly forceful song of devotion ever recorded). The band backs his idiosyncratic frenzy with thumping drumbeats; sling-shotting, quasi-psychedelic guitar riffs and a generally, delightfully rough sound. This was an approach and a sound so revolutionary that it reverberated through the Woodstock era, inspired the countless disenfranchised youths who became the punk movement in the mid-seventies and continues to echo today. True, bitter teens and twenty-somethings would have likely used music as an outlet even without the Stooges. But Iggy and company should be accredited for founding the style by which so many of them did.
0345448898|5.0|My friends were pestering mew for about a year to read these books.  I cant believe I put it off that long.  The characters and everything about this book can be vividly seen in your mind.  The third book, The Amber Spyglass comes to a heartwrenching conclusion.  These are the best books I have read since The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings(also must read and see the movie, extremely good).  If you are of any age or reading level, you must read these books, no matter how long it takes you.  If you cant read, listen to the unabridged tapes.
B0000026J6|4.0|During that musically confused decade, the eighties, an artist who debuted twenty years earlier renovates his style, adapting to new technology and a new lyrical approach after a long period during which his work received little attention. It sounds like a recipe for absolute ruin. Surprisingly, cult hero, Leonard Cohen, undergoes this process and comes out as a shining success, creating one of the best albums of his career with 1988's I'm Your Man. Despite introducing significant changes to his form, such as a polished, synthesizer-infused sound and a darkly ironic approach to lyrics, similar to recent work by alternative rock pioneers such as the Pixies and REM, the songs of I'm Your Man emphasize many things fans have always loved about Cohen: the wryly confrontational attitude (\\"First We Take Manhattan,\\" a sinister song about Cohen's disdain towards the placid, yuppie fashion and music industries of the era, \\"Everybody Knows,\\" which echoes disappointment at the post-civil rights era), the glum self-depreciation (\\"Jazz Police,\\" the magnificent \\"I Can't Forget\\") and the helpless romanticism (\\"Ain't No Cure for Love,\\" the title track, in which Cohen sounds like either Allen Ginsberg attempting to woe a woman or Dean Martin trying to creep out his usual audience). Cohen does not come off as desperate and he does not sell-out. On I'm Your Man, he merely reevaluated his musical persona and was ready for the exceptional second phase of his career.
B0000542D2|5.0|I'm having a lot of trouble to get this dvd movie of The Beatles, the best band ever was and ever will be. Anyways, if you can buy this item - don't even think about other possiblety except buying it.   \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" is a terrific movie about The Beatles on their prime, watching  their real lives behind the scenes. And also to take an unforgetable look at the guys who made music what it is today.
B00004R99M|3.0|My 3 yr old son loves so many movies. But Mary Poppins just isn't one of them for him.  Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and the Muppet Movie were even a hit with him. <br />I still love this movie myself though. It's a beautiful movie!
B000002KYR|5.0|This album is definitely one of my faves, and I think you'll all enjoy it as well.  The bluesy rock feel to it is very appealing and makes you experience almost every musical/guitar tone.  This is really the only album of ZZ Tops that you can actually listen to without wanting to hit the SKIP button to go to the next song.  Except for maybe &quot;Thug&quot;.  All the songs mentioned in all other reviews are obviously exceptional but I can surely tell you that &quot;I need you tonight&quot; is hugely UNDER rated!  I don't understand why people think it's a so-called &quot;sleeper&quot;????

B00000K19E|5.0|This is one of the best sci fi movies you will ever see.. It can be viewed and appreciated on a dozen different levels. The story, editing, and cinematography are all stellar, and the special effects are second to none.<br />The storyline and plot are way out there... but the film is carried off well enough that the viewer has no problem suspending disbelief. But on a completely different level you can go back and watch the film just to check out the incredible camera work and editing. The sets and wardrobe combine to create a sort-of postmodern, neo-apocalyptic cool. The soundtrack is very well matched to the action/feel of the film. The fight scenes are nothing short of jaw-dropping, especially considering the fact that most include Lawrence Fishburn and/or Keanu Reaves neither of whom are world-class kung fu masters (There ARE a dozen or so real life Kung Fu masters in the credits so I'm sure there was some stand-in action going on... but it is very smoothly done). Fishburn is awesome as &quot;Morpheus&quot; and really carries a lot of the plot development... Reaves is a little &quot;cardboard-ish&quot; in places but has really come a long way from &quot;Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure&quot;. If you are looking for some escapist brainless action, see this. If you are looking to have your mind blown by an incredible story with fatastic effects, see this. If you are looking for a masterpiece of the cinematographer's art... see this... but above all SEE THIS MOVIE!<br />Oh, by the way...  Is somebody on your list getting a dvd player from Santa?  Get'em a copy of this movie so they can appreciate all that hi-res, hi-fi, super-mojo digital magic their new goodies can provide!
B00005OM4Q|5.0|I first saw this film on an airplane ride. At first glance I knew this would be interesting so I watched intently. Since the plane ride I must have watched the film more than 50 times and that is not an exageration. Every 15 year old boy would want to tour with a rock and roll group and this rivetting performance brought together with the music of stillwater, led zeppelin, and elton john is a sure win. This should have won best picture at the oscars!
6303168507|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time during a matinee.  It did not cross my mind until later that my friend and I were by far the youngest people in the theater.  The youngest by about 60 years would be my guess...  It began to dawn on me what was happening when I noticed the gentleman in front of me reciting the Hebrew prayers and scriptures along with the screen, and on the way out to the lobby after the film I noticed more than one person with a number tatooed on their wrist.  Later in the film everyone in the theater was moved to tears, and I was weeping openly right along... thinking &quot;my friend is gonna think I am a wimp!&quot;...  then I heard him sob, and decided it was o.k.<br />This film is one of the most powerful and moving experiences of my life.  I think it should be mandatory for all World History high school classes to see it, because it really helps the reality of man's inhumanity to man sink in in a way that a history book seldom can.  It contains a beautiful true life story set in the midst of true life horror.  A definate must see for the subject matter and story alone...  but when you add in the fact that it is also a masterpeice of the cinematographer's art in every way...  it is a film you can rewatch on many different levels.  Get it....  See it.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Explosive -and real- Lara Croft.<BR>The video is perfect, the sound next; but I miss more rear effects. But it's not a problem because all your senses are following the gorgeous girl.<BR>The film is very good, too. Good history, landscapes, buildings...<br />It works great in MULTIZONE (original european) DVD players.
B00005QW5X|5.0|Once in a long while a movie comes along!!!!! Finally HEDWIG arrived!!! This movie is an amazing piece of art-from beginning to unfortunately the end!!!

This is a must see and must BUY film!!!!!  BRAVO JOHN CAMERON MITCHELL!!!!!!!
0345413377|4.0|Here we are at an end of Phillip Pullman's surprising trilogy.  Whew!  A sigh of relief that I can get back to normal life.<BR>Pullman is what &quot;they&quot; call &quot;spellbinding&quot; in &quot;their&quot; more hackneyed moments.  But he's more than that.  Like most good authors he doesn't fit into a preprepared box.  This is not fantasy of the Tolkeinesque variety.  It is not children's writing (although clever kids could well love it more than Potter).  What we can say is this: it's a clever man, who's widely read, and a brilliant story teller, making an honest tale about big stuff.  (Theology meets physics: Fritjof Capra's Tao of Physics meets John Milton: its an ugly soundbite but gives something of the flavour.)<br />Its deceptively challenging stuff because beneath the excellent story lies a theology...far from &quot;simply&quot; mystic as some people seem to complain.  Much more rigorous (although would you really complain that, say, St Francis wasn't rigorous?), along the style of C.S.Lewis's Last Battle where the children find themselves in heaven - and then find out they are dead, but less Catholic and therefore (theologically speaking) less successful.  The tyranny of the God of Paradise Lost is a line taken by a famous critic called Empson, Pullman runs away with it.  He wants to kill the God of the church(es) and maintian mysticism.  It's a worthy aspiration.  The solution is to make God not God (ie not what we define him as - omnipotent, omniscient, eternal etc.) and therefore make something else logically prior to God.  For Pullmann this is a form of collective (un?)consciousness married to the environment (although he cleverly avoids animal rights by makin this consciousness a form of self-consciousness).<br />I'm going on too much.  I don't want to put anyone off - you can read it as you would any cracking read.  But if you want maybe that gives you a hint of what you could try and think about?
B00005R5G9|1.0|What a waste of marketing and production dollars.  Was there anyone who rented Mannequin on VHS in the last five years who thought &quot;Gosh, this movie would be so much better in digital widescreen&quot;?  Could be worse, I guess.  It could come bundled with Mannequin 2.
0446677450|4.0|This book is an amazing book that really teaches people how to become rich. The concepts of the way you should manage and take care of your money is a very important concept that i believe people lack. This book at times though uses repetative boring storys to get the point through so at times you just want to skip a section. But the book is well written and is comprehenisve to the &quot;normal&quot; person. Its easy to understand terms and diagrams along with the great deal of information makes this book a awsome book to read.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I have to admit that the first time I saw Phantom Menace, I hated it.  Jar-Jar was irritating, and young Anakin was sickeningly sweet. It definately was not the Star Wars that I remembered from my childhood without Luke, Leia, and Han (who I still think is a very nice looking man).<br />I've gotten to where I like Phantom Menace.  It no longer irritates me to the point of exasperation, and Jar-Jar has actually grown on me. I think that it sets the stage well for the next two episodes and I am looking forward to seeing Attack of the Clowns..oops, Clones...when it hits the theatres this spring.  I still miss the old cast, but it'll be interesting to see how the characters are developed.
B00004R99I|5.0|i love this movie because  i like pochantas!
B00005LMBK|4.0|Anyone who does not like this CD needs to understand something and that is Gorillaz is for those who like many styles of music. Second of all as a fan of Blur I can tell you that Damon Albarn's voice always sounds like it does here.  Its a little thin, but it works for my taste.  That out of the way I have to say that this sounds a good deal like Beck.  Its an interesting mix of many styles, and as when Mr. Hansen is in top form, it works.  &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot;  is a good example of why I like this CD.  It feels sad, but you still want to move around to it.  &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; and &quot;19-2000&quot; are just plain fun.  &quot;Latin Simone (Que Pasa Contigo)&quot; is a cool mix of Blur's sound, Latin and hip-hop.  &quot;Rock the House,&quot; as we're told, would not be out of place as a Parliment song.  Everything else is quite good as well, with the exception of &quot;Man Research&quot; and &quot;Slow Countr&quot; being not quite as good as the rest.  If you ask me it does say something about a CD when the slow, sad songs still make you feel like moving around.  A very good, interesting mix of diverse styles and talents.  It makes you wish there were bands willing to take these chances and try things done on this CD.  Check it out if you want something different and fun!
B00005R87Q|5.0|I think that this movie is prof that the (japanese) sport \\"karts\\" are no way near the power of the legendary american muscle cars. The (japanese) sport \\"karts\\" in this film were in there maximum power (nitros oxide + twin turbo cars)could not match the the pure power of the CHARGER (not in its full potencial), an all steel car, or any of the AMERICAN MUSCLE CARS of the past or even today MUSCLE CARS. I think this movie is prof for those who think that today import cars are the fastest. My SS CAMARO easly can go 160+ MPH with no problems and without any modifications at all, not like the \\"(japanese) fully modified Sport Karts\\" that are breaking bolts to go only 150 MPH!!!! What a shame:(  (...)
B000002GW5|5.0|Not many records can mark a time, an era.  Even fewer can help create it.  This record surely does, and the proof is that after all these years you can continuosly hear this record and never feel bored.  Magical...
B00005636I|3.0|Despite the black metal voices and aggressive musicianship, this is neoclassical heavy metal of the previous generation done up in a newer style. While sweetly dissonant and churning emotion in its scenery of changing moods, this release is ultimately unsatisfying to the mind while the body is sated. A better band in this style would be At the Gates or Sacramentum.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I honestly dont think that a  lot of peopel who revewied this CD negatively, even bothered to listen to it, because much of teh information was incorrect. First of all, teh album is great and much different than her otehr two, with funky beats and a different sound. Proof of this is producers such as teh Neptunes, and Dido. Its great club music, and i just want to clear up one thing about the album. Not all of britney's fans are 9 and 10 years old. I happen to be univeristy-attendee, and am a huge fan of Britney's as are a lot of other older people that I know. No- we don't have her posters on our walls, but we nevertheless love her music. Her songs such as &quot;Boys&quot;, is targeted towards a older crowd and teh entire CD can by no means be labled as &quot;bubblegum&quot;. IN short, Brit's new CD is somethign different for EVERYONE, contrary to popular belief.
B00000720W|2.0|The early days of Mayhem shows mostly tuneless songwriting with cludgy, battering rhythm that achieves little more than Hellhammer although with enigmatic simplicity. Unless you are a Mayhem maniac and like their older stuff quite a bit, avoid this Venom-inspired primitive offering.
B00003CXTF|4.0|Now I have read some of the reviews on this movie and I don't think it deserves all the critisism it's received. For starters, I love historical movies and am a big fan of the History Channel. I didn't really know a whole lot about the attack on Pearl Harbor until I watched the movie. Sure it may not go entirely on fact and some things are exaggerated but isn't that how all movies this day and age are? As for the love triangle, sure it could have been better but I don't think it was all that bad. Many people, myself included don't care much for war movies, but when you add a little romance to the action it makes it worth watching. How many people can think of Titanic without thinking of Jack and Rose? Adding fiction with real events is what makes a movie. The acting didn't seem bad to me, I didn't find any difference in it then other great movies. The war scenes were great in my opinion, I was glues to them unlike other war movies I've seen before. As for the widescreen, when I got into the movie, I didn't even notice it was there. I have to say I hate widescreen movies. In my opinion, Pearl Harbor brought me action, drama adventure and romance all at the same time, and yes I do compare it to Titanic because its on of those movies that add to the tragedy of what happened, exaggerated and fictionalized a little or not. It changed my perspctive of what happened that day in 1941, and gave me more of a clue on how it changed the history of our country. Take this review any way you like, but don't not watch the movie because of the reviews. You never know, you just might like it.
0385505833|1.0|John Grisham is not what you would call a great prose stylist, and his canon is not what you'd call brain food.  Character development isn't a particular strong suit either.  (Can you even name any of his characters more than a couple of days after putting down one of his books?)  But when he's at his best the man does spin a good yarn.  Unfortunately he is far from his best in SKIPPING CHRISTMAS.<br /> The premise is fine.  Luther and Nora Krank, facing their first Christmas without their daughter, Blair, who has joined the Peace Corp, decide to forego all the trappings just this one year and take off on a Caribbean cruise.  Who hasn't dreamed at one point or another of avoiding the commercial morass that Christmas has become?  I'm single with no children, and I spent close to $4000 meeting my Christmas \\"obligations\\" last year.  I like Christmas, but I can relate to the Kranks.<br /> There's a wealth of comic material to be mined here, but Grisham's plot is a contrived mess, his characters (caricatures) a faceless mob, his ending an unabashed rip-off of \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\"  It is unlikely that the fascistic, shallow, vindictive, downright nasty families of Hemlock Street could have anything to teach the Kranks or anyone else about the meaning of Christmas.  The book, short as it is, needs editing: too many of the descriptions are repetitive.  There are too many unresolved plot points: just who is Marty Whathisname, the mystery guest?  Worst of all, and I don't remember this from any of the other Grisham novels I have read, he's offensive.  The Kranks' concern over the skin color of their daughter's South American fiance is resolved thus: \\"He wasn't dark at all! At least two shades lighter than Luther himself!  They hugged and squeezed their daughter as if she'd been gone for years, then, with great relief, met their future son-in-law.\\"  End of subject.<br /> When I was in med school I was part of the transcription service.  I'd end each of my transcribed lectures with a couple of relevant quotes.  I'd like to do the same here:<br /> \\"A classic tale for modern times\\"--from the dust jacket, SKIPPING CHRISTMAS.<br /> \\"Bah, humbug.\\"--from a true classic tale.ures with a couple of relevant quotes.

B00005QDW1|4.0|After being somewhat dissointed with No Doubt's third cd &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;, I have to say that &quot;Rock Steady&quot; is much better. This cd has a definite techno sound to it, and although I'm not a big fan of techno by any means, I really like this cd. By far, the best song on this cd is &quot;Hella Good&quot;. No Doubt has been through a lot of horrible things over the past fifteen years, and their maturity is starting to show in this album.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|OK so people were upset when Disney's Bambi dies and some people are upset that the word 'damn'is use twice in the movie Shrek but give me a break, today's youngsters are not as fragile as some parents would lead you to believe. <br />We put this DVD on when a few 'rugrats' were visiting and their eyes were glued to the set watching the show. When we asked them if they liked the movie we got a resounding 'NO' but, their eyen never left the set and when they were leaving they all wanted to stay and asked their parent to came back so that they could watch more great movies. <br />My kids are pretty well grown now and I remember that we used to take them to the movies regularily. Unfortunately some of them were so sweet that I think they should be banned for 'cruelty' to the parents that have to endure them and avoid from falling asleep. I certainly will never forget jumping at least 4 feet out of my seat when one of the mean bears in the 'Care Bear' movie jumped out of the bushes and growled so loud that most grandparents got heart palpitations. <br />This movie at least is presented in such a way that its a pleasure for all to take a monet with the kids to watch and laugh. What a great story ....
B000003TAW|5.0|Ahhh...weezer...Where do I begin? Nothing can cheer me up like weezer...Whether it's a gentle song like \\"My name is Jonas\\" or a song that kicks total (...), like \\"Say it ain't so\\" this whole album should be considered a work of art. Weezer gained an almost cult-like status with this cd, and a bounty of geeky punk-rock fans. Rivers Cuomo is my favorite lead singer of any current band hands down. Pain brings great art for Cuomo, and this whole album is proof of that. With only ten songs, I don't know how my cd collection survived without this album in the first place. Ten songs may seem fairly short to many people, but Weezer packs so much into each song, it seems like much more. With the drving bass in \\"Say it ain't so\\" and the awesome lyrics to \\"Only in dreams\\", Weezer will draw you into their music one way or another, and that is in no way a bad thing.
B00003CXDZ|4.0|I have never been a musical movie fan. The last musical that I saw was &quot;Grease&quot; and that was like centuries ago. But after seeing this film I have to say I really missed out. The thing that was drawing about Moulin Rouge is the fact that the actors of the film are not known for their musical skills, well that's my opinion and my knowledge of the people in the showbiz world amounts to a little more than nil. However after hearing Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman sing bankable songs and music that I'm soooo familiar with, I was just hooked. I guess that's what I liked about it and the story line was so well if I can say &quot;believable&quot; because life can be so tragic. Ok-OK not always. <br />Well to cut my rambling short - it was touching, and very entertaning. I hope you go and see it or even own a copy to make it part of the archives of great musicals.<br />To the makers and actors of the film - you did a great job, be proud - Come what may.

0380973650|4.0|Mr. Gaiman's writing efforts, in the past, have pleased me immeasurably (Stardust and Neverwhere).  This novel was also well planned and delivered but became a bit wordy as time went by.  I think Mr. Gaiman needed a slightly better editor for the piece.  But his research and obvious enjoyment of the material (mythological gods) came shining through.<br />The story revolves around a recently released convict named Shadow.  He'd spent some time in jail for assault and was ready to come out and rejoin society...and he does...except as soon as he's released he learns that his wife just died in a car accident while performing a not-so-flattering act of adultry on his best friend (who was driving and was also killed).  Thrown into society and now dealing with his wife's funeral, Shadow soon meets up with a stranger named Wednesday.  Wednesday, as it turns out, is one of many of the Gods that Shadow will bump into on this long journey into Godhood.  Godhood?  That's right, Godhood.  Shadow learns his lineage with the help of Wednesday and soon all the pieces of the story begin to fall into place.<br />There's also a pivotal battle that builds from the beginning of the novel til near the end (the war of the Gods from the old world --- Odin and such --- versus the Gods of the new world --- the internet Gods, TV gods, etc.).  But this is merely a big sideline to the main story: the development of Shadow into his rightful place.<br />Which Gods are in here?  Well I'm not exactly sure of all of them (indeed I'm not sure if anyone except a scholar with a degree in mythology would know), but I do know that Odin, Kali, Venus, and quite a few others play pivotal roles in Shadow's development and rise.  And how does he come into this role?  Well the book will have to tell you that.  It's fun, it's a bit long, but worth your reading time.  I'd give it an A-.
0440234743|5.0|This book is an excellent display of Grisham's talent.  He has a mind that surpasses all others.  The plot is amazing, and captivates you from the beginning and then takes wicked turns that will apall you.  If there is one book that you have to read it is this book.
6303979882|4.0|I don't often sit thru' an entire movie without moving at all, but I sat through this whole movie. It was good in that the story was told fluently by the mature acting of the young cast. I think the adult cast merely cameoed. In fact, Rosie O'Donnell and Demi Moore's face looked devoid of emotion most of the time. But the young cast was brilliant. The camaraderie among the four girls was brought out in such an awfully touching manner. A good movie about childhood should be one that leaves the audience wishing people never have to grow up, and this was one of those movies.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Truly an imaginative way to experience a movie - and, while certainly not for the &quot;weak-minded&quot;, I think of the line I just read from one review that stated that it was &quot;courageous&quot; to make this film in the US. While I do not agree with his brutal assessment that we are as dimwitted as he thinks we are, I DO think that we are far too accustomed to the &quot;linear&quot; approach to movies - bad guy does bad thing, good guy gets him, blah blah blah. Twists and turns everywhere. Excellent dialogue, especially for Guy Pearce. What is unclear to me, even after a couple of viewings (and with a substantial IQ), is how Natalie <BR>is involved with the story - it is a little blurry towards the end. All in all, fits into my top 10 favorites of all time (displacing Pulp Fiction)
B00005R2BG|5.0|This movie is the best the dancing intermixed with new up to beat music makes this movie very enjoyable.  Nicole Kidman has the most beautiful singing voice let alone her acting in this movie.  Ewan McGregor is great with the acting and singing as well.  This Movie is one of my personal fav.'s! Hope you enjoy.
B00005U122|5.0|Roger Waters In the Flesh DVD is, simply put, extraordinary. Captured live in Portland, Oregon, the DVD delivers music engineering at its cutting-edge best (thank you Mr. Guthrie) and is as visually breathtaking as it is seamless. At long last, the work of rock and rolls' most unique, powerful lyricist has been given the attention it deserves, and the result is nothing short of remarkable. On a scale of one to ten, I'd say this one's a 12. Mark Hunt / producer /Tom Dowd &amp; the Language of Music
B00005R2BG|4.0|I gave this film 4 stars minus one star for its flaw of not finishing most of the songs in the film.  Otherwise, this is a great film.  I loved it, the visual effects were great, the story, and the music, was all spectacular. Nicole Kidman was abosolutely beautiful and her voice very similar to Helen Reddy.  I think Ewan McGregar was great as well, didn't know he could sing either.  <br />However, my husband thought it was the dumbest movie ever.  I'd say rent it first, and if you like then buy it.<br />Unfortunately it is only available on DVD.  They did the same thing with A Knights Tale (another great film).  Hollywood dosen't seem to realize not all of us are rich enough to own a DVD player yet.<br />Thanks.
B000003TAB|4.0|If you are looking for your first Nirvana CD get Nevermind, or In Utero if you don't want the poppy sound of Nevermind. But, whatever you do don't get Incesticide first. It is a great CD spanning all of the sounds of Nirvana, from pop,to punk,to pure grunge. If this is your first Nirvana experience you may, quite literally, be scared away from them. Let's just face it, the lyrics of the last songs are just disgusting and sick, but if you've gotten used to it through Bleach and In Utero it won't bother you too much. Just make sure you are used to it. I reccomend this Cd to Nirvana fans who don't JUST like Nevermind. By the way the linear notes don't come on new cd's.
B000059MPH|3.0|Agatha Christie's complex MURDER ON THE NILE comes to the screen with the obligatory star-studded cast and a script that--while reasonably faithful to the original story--sacrifices the novels' sense of atmosphere and one of Christie's more celebrated plots for the sake of broad performances with a comic tone.  The story focuses on a romantic triangle, with Mia Farrow in the role of a young woman who has been cast aside and now stalks her ex-lover and his wealthy wife on their honeymoon, even going so far as to book passage on a tourist ship with the couple.  Needless to say, the newlyweds take a dim view of her presence, and the tension of the situation errupts into murder.<br />Peter Ustinov is obviously miscast in the role of Hercule Poriot and therefore plays the role for humor; much the same may be said of David Niven in the role of Johnny Race, a character clearly adapted from the Capt. Hastings of several Christie novels.  Like Ustinov, Mia Farrow is poorly cast in the role of the woman wronged, but the supporting cast--including Bette Davis, Angela Landsbury, George Kennedy, and Maggie Smith--offer good value; their over-the-top performances make the film quite watchable.<br />This adaptation is truly &quot;Christie-Lite,&quot; an effort to cash in on the popularity of the earlier film MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS without going to the same effort.  It's mindless fun at best, and many will enjoy it as such, but those expecting a fullfledged adaptation of a Christie classic will be more than a little disappointed.
B00005QDW1|1.0|I would give this album 0 stars if I could.  The album is horribly repetitive and even the songs are repetitive as well.  The songs are essentially a chorus repeated from the beginning to the end of the song.  I admire No Doubt for exploring a new sound, but this is a terrible choice and I hope this is not the direction they will be taking the music in the future.  Tragic Kingdom and Return of Saturn are both fantastic albums worthy of anybody's collection, but if you haven't got this album and you are considering it, at least make sure you give it a listen before wasting your hard earned cash.
B000002G1Y|4.0|I wonder what would have happened had Don Smith produced this record rather than Matt Wallace?  There's a harsh quality to the sound of this record that contrasts sharply with the subsequent Smith-produced &quot;Walk On&quot;, and to a large degree it hampers my enjoyment of it.  I'm not an expert, but I think the harshness has something to do with the key in which the songs are performed, which seems to be on the high end of Hiatt's vocal range, and the way in which the record was recorded and mixed.  Since Hiatt always writes thoughtful lyrics, I like PGG, but I don't think the recording reaches the potential of the songs.
B00000DATR|4.0|I was very surprised to see TB3 at the music store two years ago since I hadn't heard anything about Mike Oldfield releasing anything new. Of course \\"Tubular bells\\" is a very strong commercial brand and one can't help thinking that the good old Mike is trying to get the most out of the impact this label has on music lovers instead of calling this album, I don't know, \\"The top of the morning\\" or \\"Far above the clouds\\". But since I adored TB and TB2 I decided to give it a try. As a matter of fact the techno intro made me have second thoughts about buying this album, but since I am a patient guy, fortunately I didn't skip it. I ended up buying it as I loved the rest of the album.<br /><br /> Everyone, throughout their life, experiences what they call the tastes' evolution. There were so many bands and singers I was mad about in my teen years whose music seems so childish to me now, and on the other hand, there were so many other ones whose music took so many years to reach me, like classical music for instance. I remember my dad taking me almost by force to every symphonic concert or opera (since he was a musician) when I was around 10-14 years old. I own about four hundred CD-s now and, thanks to my dad, half of them are classical music.<br /><br /> Mike Oldfield is one of the few musicians whose music I loved in my teen years and I love even more now. Yes, TB3 is inferior to TB and TB2, but the Beatles never wrote anything that could at least equal \\"Yesterday\\", Led Zeppelin never wrote anything that could even come close to \\"Stairway to heaven\\". What is common to all sheer masterpieces is that they're simply hard to top.<br /><br /> And hey, in the nineties' music desert, this album comes out as a true masterpiece!
B0000507R0|5.0|This album was meant to be listened to in surround.  DVD-audio is the perfect format for this classic recording.
B000002IOW|4.0|I can remember how much I was looking forward to this album when it was released back in 1989. Just two years before, one of my favorite albums was released in Hold Your Fire. Yes, you read that correctly. I think it's a great album by a great band. The follow up to HYF, Presto, is also good, but not quite as good as HYF or the earlier Power Windows.  Having said that, I can recall some whining by the Rush faithful when they first heard this album. It's almost as if some want every album to be 2112, Permanent Waves, or Moving Pictures. While those are good albums, this is a band who refuses to stand pat, almost as if they're always asking &quot;what can we try next?&quot;<br />From the first loud crashes of &quot;Show Don't Tell&quot;, we're given one song after another of varying musical direction and the typically thoughtful lyrics dealing with a wide range of topics. &quot;The Pass&quot;, on the melancholy side, is a great song along with &quot;Hand Over Fist&quot; (which received limited airplay), &quot;Available Light&quot;, and the title song. Others, including &quot;Chain Lightning&quot;, &quot;War Paint&quot;, and &quot;Red Tide&quot; are not quite as strong but there are no bad songs here. <br />This is only one of several albums by the band from the late 80's/early 90's that now needs revisiting so that some of the faithful can see what they've been missing. I suspect many will be surprised.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is such a beautiful movie, and it's saddening to think that this is the last of the &quot;Red Curtain&quot; trilogy by Baz Luhrman.  In a style like Strictly Ballroom and Romeo + Juliet, Moulin Rouge tells a story, a tragic in this case, through ways of music.  As for my opinion, I truly loved it because of everything: acting, singing, choreography, story, visuals, everything.  Nicole gives one of best perfomances-this year seems to be Nicole's best, along with The Others-while Ewan plays a charming yet shy character so perfectly.  Moulin Rouge will be a classic in years to come.
B000000IVW|5.0|Appetite for Destruction is simply one of the greatest rock albums ever made, and is one of those albums that is unreal from start to finish (see The Joshua Tree). The album came around just in time to give the music industry the shot in the arm it needed amidst the <BR>endless supply of hair and &quot;boy&quot; bands in the late 80's. Mr. Brownstone, Sweet Child and the incredibly underrated Rocket Queen contain some of the best licks ever. Say whatever you want about Axl Rose, but the man flat out has vocal chops, and absolutely soars on this album with his range. Izzy Stradlin provides the most powerful yet tasteful balance of rhythm guitar since Keith Richards. An absolute must for anyone who considers themselves a hard rock fan.
B000002UAU|4.0|The only reason why I gave Sg. Pepper 4 stars is because I got sick of it. But I remember every night listening to it striaght through, over and over again. Some say that &quot;Within you without you&quot; is the one song they skip over, but they obviously haven't given it enough consideration. They hear the sitars and they just bug out. This is world music. Yes, it's different than the normal electric guitars, bass, and drums for a band, but it's a great song. It's very melodic. A Day in the Life is a classic, and I think often overlooked, Beatles song. From the beginning fatalism and surrealism to Paul's little solo vocal down to the crashing last piano chord, the song is just powerful. This may be one the best CDs to give someone who is just being introduced to the Beatles or they dont have it and they are fans. That or the Imagine Soundtrack. That is a great CD too.
B000007OY0|5.0|I recently caught &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot; during one of its 962 yearly showings on TNT (whenever they're not playing &quot;Top Gun&quot;).  I won't try to encapsulate my rapture like the other reviewers have done here (almost) uniformly and very effectively.  It's as good or better than every word written on these pages.<br />What I will say is that I savaged Tim Robbins' &quot;Cradle Will Rock&quot; in an earlier review, and now after seeing &quot;Shawshank Redemption,&quot; I'm feeling no small bit of remorse about that.  Robbins' stunning work in &quot;Shawshank&quot; gives him the absolute right to pursue projects like &quot;Cradle.&quot;<br />Tim, if you're out there: sorry about that, man.  Keep those creative juices flowing.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I got this cd on my birthday, which was before ever actually seeing the movie, and never having read the books, I was still happy to receive it. It has excelent music! Some fun songs like &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; and the beginning of the song &quot;Dark rider&quot; is light hearted (not for long though). It has great action music that makes you want to know what's happening just by listening. Also some sad songs, like enya's theme for Aragorn and Arwin, and May it be, the song playing during the credits is one of Enya's most beautiful. This is a fabulous cd to add to anu collection! And besides that, each cd has a card of a different charactor (Arwin, Frodo, Bilbo, Gandolf, Aragorn, ect.) I personally have frodo sporting a smashing new sword. Underneath the card is the reall cover. So what I want  you to do now, is scroll up to the top of the screen and click the add to cart button. There is no chance you won't like this cd, unless you have serious mental problems.
B000002GFC|5.0|In its short carrer of three years Cream set the standard for many rock supergroups to come. Their style was pioneer to many hard rock/heavy metal bands to they also experimented with more pop oriented material (Anyone for Tenis for example). Their albums made an important contribution to rock but its the singles or hits that stand as jewels today. This reissue of the best of Cream offers the best single CD collection in the market today. All the key songs such as Badge, Sunshine of yur Love and White Room are presented. Also, the remastered work makes Clapton, Bruce and Baker shine as it gives the recordings new life and clarity. This is all you need to have if you are interested in searching about Cream. If you like this and need more material the best place to go is the box set that givesyou their complete recordings.
0385505833|5.0|Skipping Christmas is great and an enjoyable read.  I like the way Grisham deals with Christmas from various points of view.  His portrayal Luther and Nora Krank is XLNT.  I saw a lot of my thoughts and feelings in them.  To go into detail may take away from such a good story, so I won't.  Pick the book up and read it.  It is good for some laughs as well as a multi-faceted view of Christmas.
B00003CY5J|5.0|This is just one of those perfect movies, if you like no-tongue-in-check drama/action. Just Great! Both Deniro and Norton can produce sub-standard fare, but this is not one of those. All the actors in this are in PEAK form and the movie deserves to be right up there with the &quot;In The Line of Fire&quot; class of movies. Picture clear, sound perfect. More than I could ask. If I could find one of these a month, I would be a happy guy.
B000002L9J|5.0|this album is brilliant. lyrically and musically, this was the apex of the two meshing together. the hilarious lyrics of \\"frankly...\\" and the aggressive strumming of \\"bigmouth...\\" indicate a mature band at the peak of their ability. songs such as the beforementioned and \\"there is a light that never goes out,\\" and \\"some girls are bigger than others\\" are perfect pop songs for the ages. 15 years after their release they are just as relevant and beautiful as they were back in the day.
B00003CXCQ|3.0|Movie is EXCELLENT!<br />DVD is AWESOME!... when it works!<br />You can read most of the other reviews to get an idea on how great this DVD is, however, be aware that it might not work in your PC, XBOX or even your DVD Player!<br />We purchased this DVD and gathered everyone around the TV to see one of the best Disney movies ever.  My kids were EXCITED however, when it started to play it skipped and stuttered.  OK, break out the XBOX... it says the DISK IS DAMAGED.  Doesn't look like it, so I go over to the PC, can't play there either, over to another PC and yet another... still same problem.  So, we watched Shrek (a good movie but a let down from the Snow White incident.)<br />I took it into a store and played it on their DVD players, it worked on some and not on others (older players and low end players had the most problems.)<br />Writing to Microsoft (re: XBOX) and Buena Vista receives a form letter reply (if anything) saying they are working on it.  It has been almost a month without any resolution.  The DVDROM Players have since been updated to watch it, but I don't want to gather the kids around the monitor.<br />So, beware of the poison DVD er Apple.
0375507507|5.0|A maxim that is often repeated is that history is written by the winners. This personal narrative of growing up in Africa is written by one of the losers in the Zimbabwe/Rhodesia conflict. Her parents were determined to remain in Africa on their own terms and paid the price for their fight. This is probably the best account of the personal struggle of the last of the colonialists. Fuller's writing is intense, economical and unsentimental.
B00004WKII|5.0|Jimi Hendrix is the most influencial guitar player that there is and after listening to this box set is the most influencial to come!!. It is amazying just how much material this box contains. The best thing is that it contains previously unreleased alternate takes, demos and lives recorgings that let you dig deeper into this gifted musician.<br />Just about every step of Hendrix career is covered by this boxed set: The Experience period, the Band of Gipsy the New Rays of the Rising Sun... Its simply gigantic. Jimi Hendrix recorded only three studio albums and one live set while he was alive but I had already lost track of how many post death releases are out there. I though that there could be no more new material that could impressed be but this box set proved me wrong!!<br />The inner book its filled with photos and commentaries from producers and musicians. It complements the music very well and explains the tracks for further appreciation of them<br />The thing with this set is that it brings value to those who already own the studio albums. It is not a good starting point as it is no easy listening and is no greatest hits package. For that there are some other single or double CDs available that can work in that direction as well as the the official reissues of the studio albums.
B00005QFE5|5.0|It is really unbelieavable sometimes, how a truly simple story can be transformed into a strong film. Zhang Yimou did it again!<BR>When watching this film, listening to this beautiful music I felt in love with this calm and pure world, long lost in the hectic life of our &quot;western civilization&quot;.<BR>Pure - unaffected acting, some time it seems like a documentary.<BR>Zhang Ziyi confirms her acting talent. See this movie and feel the calmness, the love, the Aristotelian &quot;catharsis&quot;.<BR>Highly recommended.
B00005U2LM|5.0|I bought this and Ghostface's 'Bulletproof Wallets' within quick succession and it is easy to see which one got the more attention. There are some really good examples of RZA's production on this, with him displaying a swing towards the funky, souly edge of the genre. I agree with other reviewers about Flavor Flav being annoying, and i don't like the tendancy for U-God to growl hooks. I was also a bit concerned that some of the lyrics were a little - over-materialistic (especially some of Rae's verses) but they are compensated for by some great work by GZa and Masta Killah. I did wonder where Cappadonna was and the album does miss ODB. I loved almost every track and it is definitely the best album to come from the Wu-Fam (along with 'Fear Love and WAr' for a good while.
B000002UJQ|5.0|&quot;In an inter-stella burst, i'm back to save the universe!&quot; croons Thom Yorke in the opener &quot;Airbag&quot;.  What he is really saying is that this paticular work, i call it a work because it is much more then just music, has saved rock as well as all music.  In a world where Youth is more interested in mindless noise that gets pawned off as music, this is truely a revalation.  I could go into the in's and out's of every song, but that is pointless here.  What people need to understand is that this is much more then a collection of songs, it's art.  It's magic.  It's a band who said that they would push not only the limits of music today, but also the listener's limits.  Every time i put this album on (and i only listen to it on headphones for the full effect) i am taken aback by it's beauty, originality, and bravery.  It is truely a masterpiece.
6301871952|3.0|There are two versions of this movie around.  Remember that scene wher Christopher Lee walks up to Billy and sais he saw a gremlin?  On the video, the picture gets screwed up (because the gremlins are sapposed to be fooling around with the projector) and then they get in a gun fight with John Wayne.  However, when this is on movie channels (HBO, Encore, Starz) a very different version of this scene happens.  The picture gets screwed up and then we get some very quick shots of Black-And-White nude woman, followed by watching a mother (in color) pulling her daughter out of a theatre and complaining to a manager.  Then, a man comes down with a tangled up projector and screams &quot;There are Gremlins in the projector&quot;.  The manager walks into the theatre and talks to a big guy named Hunk, who screams &quot;You Gremlins run the rest of Gremlins 2 right now!&quot;  He then looks at the screen and sais &quot;Sorry folks.  It won't happen again.&quot;  The whole gunfight part is not there.  I think a DVD should be released with both versions of the movie available, because there is no video featuring this scene (fortunatly I recorded it) and I'm sure fans would like to own both cuts of the movie.  Don't you agree?<br />If you found my reveiw helpful (I hope you did) please vote for me.  Thanks a lot!
B000002G23|5.0|The Police will rank as one of the most influencial rock bands in the 20th century. Their musical recording career started back in 1977-78 until 1984. This is only about six years but they were very productive and creative. During that time, The Police experimented form every sound from punk to ska to reagge and rock. To me they were as influential as the Beatles. Modern bands like U2 and Depeche Mode have been inspired by this british trio. <br />This is what makes this collection a must have. It covers every studio album ever released by the Police plus a few singles and live tracks. It is not one of those cases when you wished a track was included. It is simply all you need to have as their complete catalog is included. The only thing that this collection does not cover is the Live CD that was released a couple of years after this box was. But  the Live CD is still in print and available if you want it.
B00005JKES|5.0|This DVD collection combines the best experiences from watching Twin Peaks on television.  It brings with it the original episodes and the recap of previous episodes as seen on network, but also allows us to watch the Log Lady monologues that were only available when the show replayed on the Bravo network.  Sound and picture quality, of course, better that how we originally saw it.  Nice features in the DVD without going over the top.  I only hope that when they release the Pilot it will be the actual pilot as broadcast on network and not the &quot;European Version&quot; that is currently the only version of the pilot available on VHS.
0671027573|5.0|I read this book from cover to cover in one evening!  The mix of mystery, romance and friendship was very entertaining...it also helped that the book takes place in the Detroit metro area; which is an area to which I am very familiar. Regardless, I enjoyed this book very much and have already recommended it to several of my friends.
B00005RFQ5|2.0|I had been a Prince nut since 1982. At 12 years old 1999 was a life changing album for me. Personally Sign o' The Times is my favorite album still. During the 90's he shined briefly with The Gold Experience. Other than a few stand out tracks its been downhill from there. The Rainbow Children for me is the most lyrically restrictive album he has ever released. Musically the most organic sound he's done in a long time. Which leaves me bitter because as much as I could enjoy the music, the lyrics leave me feeling alienated. Comparing slavery to the Holocaust is a new low. I feel a pit in my stomach every time I think of it. His idea of women and their role in the world is out of time and frankly ignorant. I could care less about a Pharaoh and his muse. His cryptic musings on &quot;The Wise One&quot; is tired and boring. The last thing I need in my music is preaching about religion. I get halfway through this album and I have to turn it off because it causes  a huge depression in my mind. Please listen before you buy. I noticed two rainbow children cd's in the used bin at my local record store already. If you are a Jehovahs Witness you might enjoy this album. But then again maybe not. I never could have imagined this. I feel like a &quot;banished one&quot;. So long P.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge has got to be the best movie of 2001. I sat down, when I was sleepy, to watch it, not expecting to finish it before I fell asleep, but I never even yawned. Moulin Rouge was one of the most spectacular (&quot;Spectacular Spectacular&quot;...lol) movies I've ever seen. I had to get use to the quick changing of scenes and such, because it's a fast paced movie, but that's what made it good. The music was awesome, and in a way, I feel the soundtrack cheated us out on some of the songs. The soundtrack is still pretty awesome anyway. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor and all of the other cast could sing, dance, and wonderfully entertain. Nicole Kidman surprised me majorly. She's wonderful. This and The Others has made her one of my favorite actresses. Words can't describe her performance here. It was unbelievable. Ewan McGregor was also very good. I haven't seen many movies with him in it, but this showed he has very extraordinary talent. John Leguizamo, as always, was hilarious. And to be honest with you, I'd never cried and laughed so much at a movie. When a character would feel anger, I would feel it. The actors did a superb job. Baz Luhrman is pure genius!<br /> The DVD, like it says on the box, is a groundbreaking and breathtaking experience. The menus are great and go right along with theme of the movie, and are navigated by The Green Fairy.  On the first disc, the commentary with Baz Luhrman is there, and a neat special viewing of the movie called Behind the Red Curtian. During the movie, The Green Fairy pops up and we are treated to different entertaining featurettes. The second disc is full of extra features. There are extended dance scenes with the multi-angle viewing option. I found this very interesting and fun. The Cutting Room includes director and producer interviews, deleted or extended scenes, and a &quot;mockery&quot; by Baz Luhrman. all very fun. There's an extensive look at the Marketing of the movie that's very worth the look. There are alsosections on the choreography and the music.<br /> The Moulin Rouge 2 disc DVD has got to be the #1 DVD ever produced as of now, and the movie will always live on with me.
B000002J2B|5.0|This album showcases the best of both worlds, long-instrumental prog tracks + pop ballads.It is the perfect mix.The early stuff like Foxtrot is great, but too one-dimensional, they never came down to earth.You have great tracks like One For The Vine (typical old Genesis), mixed with a smattering of what was in the future(your own special way,afterglow).Even with the very-sappy &quot;Special Way&quot;,there's still a beautiful electric piano solo in the middle that redeems it.The last few songs on side 2 remind me of Abbey Road in how they are completely different but end up blending seemlessly.The next album (and then there were three)was great too, but it seemed like a bunch of good bits just thrown together,with little semblance, and time -changes that didn't fit the songs.Blood On The Rooftops is the stand-out track on W+W, and without it I dont think this would be their finest.I'm a drummer, not a guitarist, but it has the finest guitar i've ever heard. Genesis 83, I think also has this fine mix of art/pop.Mama is not a toe-tapper, but probably the most unique song they've ever written.With the Invisible Touch LP, they strayed too far from their roots,and had enormous success with an album that didn't deserve it.W+W is the album that should have been that successful.It was the first CD I ever bought in 1986, though I had the LP since 77.I've bought this CD twice,86+94 to get the remaster.The remastered version now includes lyrics.The only difference is there is less hiss.They did not REMIX it, thank god.Learn the lyrics,Go out on your backdeck at night,turn off all lights,play this album start to finish, and just look at the stars, and you'll understand this album.Try it, ya might like it!!!
B00002Z88D|1.0|Metallica was one of the most greatest metal bands for the past 8 years, but after 2 dissapointing albums (load and reload), this is just trash, poor orchestral nonsense, the only two songs I Like are master of puppets and sad but true, but this cd is nothing more than a rehash of led zepplin's classic, This cd is about as bad as an boy band album.
B00005R23S|1.0|This music DVD has very average video quality, and below average audio.  Bruce Springsteen did not do a very good job of producing and performing on this video.
B00004WKII|4.0|The estate of Jimi Hendrix has been going through the archives and has been releasing CD's. The first was the absolutely fantastic Blues.<br /> This is a typical 4 CD boxset that chronologically goes through the career of an artist. What is better about this one than most is that all of the material is previously unreleased.  When someone buys a boxset, they don't want previously released material. The typical boxset buyer already owns all of the previously released material.<br />Unfortunately, this boxset doesn't get off to a good start. Except for three tracks, most of the first CD is a waste. It consists mostly of studio outtakes of half produced songs, and things that were not good enough for the original releases. Sure the intro to Third Stone from the Sun is cute, but how many times are you going to want to listen to it. There are two unnecessary versions of Hey Joe. If it were possible to play a Hendrix tune to death, this would be the one.<br />Things start to pick up on the second disk. However, alot of the live music is very similar to what is already available on other albums.  If you already have the boxset Stages, you have heard most of this before. I have always found the grunting on Foxey Lady to be eerie and unpleasant. But there are more good tracks on the second CD.<br />It really gets moving on the third CD. And the fourth CD is absolutely amazing. That is because Hendrix was still growing as a musician at an exponential rate up to the time of his death. The fourth CD does slow down near the end (who would guess that a live version of All Along the Watchtower would be so bland), but overall, the fourth CD makes this boxset worth considering.<br />If you are so into Hendrix that you love to hear him play around in the studio, this boxset if for you. If you don't already own everything by Hendrix, this is a maybe. This boxset is certainly better than most (compare it to the Stevie Ray Vuaghn boxset, which is mostly rehashed material, or Jefferson Airplane, which is 40% previously release material). You may want to get Blues, Electric Ladyland or Band of Gypsies first.
B000006CCG|5.0|No bubble gum, poppy, speed metal trash here! Forget what you've heard, just get this for one listen and you will be hooked! This is pure ROCK METAL in thunderous magnatude. I remember when this first came out, that I had never heard of this band. The album cover at first glance was enough to know that it was going home with me to get cranked. I have over 1200 CDs and this one still ranks high for face splitting crunch! Also, check out a band called SWORD. The album is &quot;metalized&quot; ......... get it as well and put it right next to this WASP album for future hellraising! You won't be disappointed.
B00005U2LM|4.0|True Wu Tang fans will be a little disapointed in this album due to the fact that there are many hooks on the songs, and that the beats and lyrics are more watered down than albums like &quot;Wu Tang Forever&quot; and all the first Wu solo releases. However the album is better than the pathetic &quot;The W&quot; cd which was an embarresment to the Clan's reputation. It would be nice to see the Wu Tang Clan return to more experimental beats and rhymes(Ie. Wu Tang Forever, Supreme Clientele), as the beats are not that cutting edge on this album. Over all the album is good, but their are no real suprises, as they are still going after the mainstream audience, but not as bad as &quot;The W&quot;
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Jimi Hendrix hated hits, hit lists and so on. He hated music being commercialized; listened to for a while and when the song is no more at the hit list people forget it and move on to the next hit. Thats not the way music should be treated. But thats whats going on here.<BR>The music on the cd is absolutely great, no doubt made by a genius. But Im just asking that who can say what were and are Jimis best songs? Is his first hit \\"Hey Joe\\" better than \\"Burning Of the Midnight Lamp\\" or \\"Ezy Ryder\\" which are not, by the way, included at the cd. The trouble is that when listening to this cd, I cant feel the true meaning of these songs, the feeling Jimi had when he made his masterpieces. They are just songs put on a record not even caring about which song comes after which. It leaves you cold. For example, First Rays Of the New Rising Sun has a LOT of soul in it and when you listen to it, youll be taken to another, very sweet, sensitive and beautiful world... but that doesnt happen when listening to this cd ( read my review about First Rays if you got interested =)...). <BR>Anyways, Im not saying that the songs are bad, no way! but the idea, making a \\"greatest hits\\" -album of Jimis song (...). No one can ever say what are his greatest hits, YOU have to decide it for yourself. But this is just not the real Jimi... this cd was made for the money. Dont give the money to them. Love, music... thats whats important. Not the money.
B00003CXN4|4.0|i am relenting in giving it only 4 stars instead of 5 just because it is so long, this movie was turned down by most of the major studios, most likely because it dissects the drug war and just like the politicians, everybody is afraid to tell it like it is.  A FAILURE OF MASSIVE PROPORTIONS!  i'm sure the studio heads are eating that decision 4 Academy awards and untold accolades later.  Even the Drug War supporters were forced to employ their spin doctors to deflect the huge reaction caused by Traffic.  BRAVO! BRAVO! for Traffic and for Soderbergh and for the brave decision of the studio to take this on.  Soderbergh is a superb director and I have been following his career since \\"Out of Sight\\".  This movie got people thinking and THATS what makes it so imortant and SO timely.  It is also riveting from beginning to end.  It amazes me so many people give this one star and have nothing but bad things to say about such a fine film.  I have to ask these folks-what is your criteria for a good movie?  Guys who dodge thousands of bullets and never mess up their hair?  Traffic has plot holes, but guess what?  So does the drug war and any plot hole highlighted in Traffic also underscores the absurdity of the Drug War.   Cops DONT protect every witness and some witnesses do get whacked. Thats not a plot hole, its reality!  Maybe the movie doesnt have big cars and topless women and shiny things that go BOOM! [...]  HURRAY for a real movie about a real subject. Traffic isnt anti-drug, its anti-drug-war and simply portrays the facts. [...]
0800187814|5.0|WOW!! Here's a film that takes completely unsympathetic characters, and yet, makes us care about them. No small task for Milos Forman as director, but casting this film with Woody Harrelson and Courtney Love as Larry and Althea Flynt respectively, was sheer brilliance.<br /><br />Woody Harrelson gives a knockout performance as formidable pornographer and publisher of the controversial \\"Hustler\\" Magazine. We meet him as a little backwoods boy selling moonshine with his brother, then a grown-up Larry selling a peek at bare-naked ladies, first in the flesh, and later in print, as he starts his publishing empire with his brother. I thought that casting Woody's REAL life brother, Brett Harrelson, as his brother in the movie, was a terrific touch.<br /><br />Speaking of authenticity, a role has never been so perfect for anyone like the role of Althea Flynt was for actress/musician Courtney Love. I think she is a fascinating dynamic personality, and that works for her extraordinarily well on the screen here.  From the moment she saunters out onto the stage to strip for Larry in the beginning, and for every moment she appears on screen through the end, she is truly mesmerizing and captivating.  Love accurately captures the innate self-destructiveness of Althea that comes to fruition once Larry is paralyzed.  When he recieves heavy narcotic pain killers by injection, she decides to partake as well, while injecting him.  We have to assume she was seeking a substitute for the physical pleasures she and a paralyzed Larry, could no longer share.  A little timeline shows us how several years go by.  When the bedroom vault they've been holed up in opens,  Althea is a  stumbling, drug addicted, disheveled, punk caricature of her former attractive strong self.  Love is SO great in her portrayal of this tragic figure, it is a crime she didn't win an award.  She certainly deserves one for this outstanding performance.

0385334206|5.0|A must read Vonnegut book.  What is great about him is every time I reread him, I get more of the jokes.  I love the pictures, sketches, and storyline.
B00005JKQX|5.0|Saw ABM at a preview showing on Tuesday night.  Had a hanky in my pocket - prepared to cry, but was pleasantly surprised that it isn't that type of film.  The movie is awesome, the acting superb, the subject matter pretty heavy-duty but presented in a easy-to-follow mode.  It was hard to believe that I was watching Russell Crowe.  All I can say is that he is just about, no - he is the best actor out there.  Can't wait for the DVD to come out!Cleo E. Blackstone
B000002P5R|5.0|This album gives you wings and lets you fly to another world. Jimi makes so wonderful sounds with his guitar... you just listen to this with your eyes closed and a smile on your face. <BR>I believe that if he had lived a little longer he would have made his last album exactly like this. The songs come in a perfect order, you just drift from song to another... and every song leaves a mark to you. You cant help laughing at Astro Man, which shows Jimis sense of humor; tears will run when you listen to Hey Baby (New Rising Sun) and &quot;Ezy Ryder&quot; has a catchy tune youd like to sing along even if you cant sing well...<BR>But anyways, this is Jimi at his best. The songs are pretty similar to &quot;Pali Gap&quot; (wonder why thats not included) but a step from songs you can hear on Are You Experienced.<BR>I know my review sounds like a silly, sentimental bunch of **** written by a teenage girl but man, just listen to this and it will open your eyes. These songs are not just songs that made it to the hit lists or to the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; -album (sorry for this little sarcasm)... they are true pearls of music. And beautiful music lives forever. This will live.
B00005BF9Z|4.0|This is quite nearly a perfect album-- thematic, catchy...multilingual.  I went through a phase during which I would ceremoniously listen to this CD at the end of each day-- it's earcandy, and it does what music should do: help you transcend.  The big stupid grin that appears all over my face whenever I pop in &quot;Esperanza&quot; is evidence.  When will Manu play in the US?
006016848X|3.0|The worst thing about this book is its repetition. First he tells you what he is going to say, then he says it, then he tells you what he just said. Then he repeats the gist of it between dotted lines in the middle of the page. When Gray cites examples, he lists so many that I, for one, don't have the patience to read the whole list. Plus, you may already be familiar with many of the ideas expressed, so you may find yourself skimming most of this book.<br />The best thing is that if you take away the repetition, the ideas expressed are true and useful for most people. At least, I think so, and I scoffed at the title, insisting I must be from Jupiter, and refused to read it for years.<br />Much of the advice to women I had already figured out on my own. (Example: you notice the garbage can is overflowing and wish your man would empty it. You wonder why he didn't notice &amp; empty it already, and wish he would do it without being asked. You feel tempted to deliver a long lecture about why he should have done it already, and present an airtight case that he is guilty of neglect. The question is, which is more important, 1. proving you are right and he is wrong, or 2. getting an empty bag in the garbage can? If the answer is 2., skip the lecture and just ask him politely to do it.)<br />My favorite chapter was \\"Women Are Like Waves.\\" In it, Gray describes a cyclical fluctuation in women's moods. Just when it seems a woman is on top of the world, she plummets, and has to reach bottom before feeling good again. Gray's wife Bonnie calls the down part of the cycle being in a well. When a woman is in her well, she confronts whatever is difficult in her life. Gray advises men to resist the temptation to try to \\"fix\\" the problem, and just be there for her and listen. He warns that the woman will feel worse before she feels better, because she has to &quot;bottom out&quot; before she can rise again. The most important point is that the whole thing will reoccur. Any unresolvedissues in a woman's life will reappear whenever she's in her well, whether they are from her past, problems with her current relationship, her career, etc. This can create a sense of \\"déjà vu\\" in an intimate relationship - \\"didn't we talk about this already?\\" From my own experience, I believe this pattern exists, at least during difficult times, and I can understand how these reoccurring conversations must be puzzling and frustrating for men. Gray's advice to them is right on target.<br />This book has often been criticized for perpetuating stereotypes or insisting everyone is the same. Many readers seem to have ignored this caveat on page 6: \\"I make many generalizations about men and women in this book. Probably you will find some comments truer than others...after all, we are unique individuals with unique experiences.\\"<br />I don't know why some readers have thought this book is insulting to women. It describes women as caring, feeling individuals who want to connect with others. It could just as easily be said it insults men by portraying them as pre-verbal, insensitive troglodytes driven by power, competition, and the fear of intimacy. Personally, I think both sexes are portrayed fairly. The aim of the book is not to pigeonhole people, but to alleviate misunderstandings brought about by common differences between men and women in what we value, what motivates us, and how we communicate.<br />Because of the repetition, I don't think the book is worth buying. But it's worth going out of your way to borrow it from a friend, from the library, or to spend some time with it in your local bookstore.

B000006TRV|5.0|This album is absolutely necessary listening.  It must be heard from beginning to end, preferabbly repeatedly.<br />As another reviewer pointed out, there are two (actually more) ways to interpret this album.<br />The wall is a story, a message.  What is being conveyed, is the thought of conformity.  Everyone fits within the wall.  Everyone keeps to themselves, watches tv, and etc. so that they begin to lack individualism.  It's easier to build a wall when all the pieces are the same shape, size, etc.  If you watch the movie, you'll see this.  The man within the wall.  The screaming face protruding form the wall.  The man jailed within the wall.  etc. etc. etc.  Then there are other ideas conveyed by this movie, but I'm still working out my interpretation of the comformity issue.<br />Another brick in the wall (pt. 2)'s lyrics are a cry against the comformity and will breaking done by the public education system (though it's not as bad as it was back then) of England and the U.S.  Anyone who thinks it's meaning has to do with keeping children ignorant needs to open their eyes up a little bit.  It's still going on today.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I peronaly like this new album, but I think that you should be the judge of if it's good or not in your opinion. But if you want my opinion, buy the CD. It's very good and Gwen is such a good vocalist! I like all their CD's, but this is one of their best!
B00005Q66T|5.0|After the IMMACILATE COLLECTION people would probably expect something almost the same. New record, remixes. But not now. This comes to show the continuous change in Madonna's style in music. She never does something the same again and again. She always pops out with something different. So in my opinion, this collection is not more about showing off pop hits, although all the songs where hits in one way or another. Its more to show Madonna's evolution through this decade. But not in a chronological order. &quot;Deeper and deeper&quot;, &quot;Erotica&quot;, &quot;Human nature&quot; are the reminders of Madonna's sexual revolution. &quot;Secret&quot; and &quot;take a bow&quot; are the lovely, chart topping ballads. Now &quot;Bedtime story&quot;, in my humble opinion is a blend of spirituality and sexuality (accompanied with a fantastic video). &quot;Dont cry for me Argentina&quot; is slowly taking us to the new Madonna, the more mature one. And we come to &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;Power od goodbye&quot; and the tracks from &quot;Ray of light&quot; that remind us of her very influential spiritual phase with a Madonna who is not only an icon, singer, sex symbol but also a mother. Finally the tracks from &quot;Music&quot; show a funky diva that can still BOOGIE WOOGIE. All the above tracks and more are mixed and as i said in the beginning, not in a chronological order so you're not getting one phase in Madonna's career for a long time but you move through each one of them. OOPS did i say too many things? Sorry, i could talk for Madonna for a whole day.<BR>What i want to say basically is, buy GHV2 and you wont miss
B000002UVZ|5.0|When Life's Rich Pageant first came out I was a bit put off by it because I was still enjoying the obscure style of REM's earlier recordings so I shelved it for almost a year. When I again listened to it, I realized I had been sitting on a gold mine of hard-rocking and beautiful pop songs. I thought sure this was the album they would never be able to top...until I heard Green (which turned out to be that album). Every song is a unique thread and all are woven together to create one of the best rock tapestries ever created. This album will always be on my &quot;stranded on an island&quot; top ten list.
B00002ND77|5.0|Spike Lee's account of the life of Malcolm X is an excellent one, however, Spike could have made the film about an hour shorter than it was, primarily by editing the beginning and ending of the movie a little tighter.<br />However, this film's greatness starts and ends with the performance of Denzel Washington. Denzel becomes Malcolm X in this film in a way that is almost frightening. Truly the most powerful performance I've ever seen in a biographical context.
B0000029DD|5.0|This is one of those albums, those rare albums, that should simply be in every CD collection.  I don't just mean people who like Pop music, or Rock, or Folk, but EVERY CD collection.  If you like classical music, buy it.  If you like showtunes, buy it.  If you ever listen to music on occasion, buy this CD.  It's that good.  And this album has acheived almost a mythic quality about it being the only studio album Jeff recorded before his death.  He is the James Dean of the music world.  Just a few recordings demonstrate his depth and range and leaves you wondering what greatness was still to come.  So do yourself a favor, get it.  Listen to it.  Learn what all the talk is about.
B00005QGAX|5.0|Although it's a CD that came out back in 1987 the special edition is good for anyone ages 5-500! It has those great songs that we all like, Man in The Mirror, The Way You Make Feel, and more. It also has a great song that was never released, Streetwalker, it might be one of the best songs on the CD too. Buy it now and as Michael once said you &quot;Wont Stop Till You Get Enough&quot;
0790729652|5.0|I think that &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Batman Returns&quot; should be separate from &quot;Batman Forever&quot; and &quot;Batman and Robin&quot;.  They didn't promote &quot;Batman Forever&quot; and &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; as sequels 3 and 4. There is nothing in the first two<br />that continues into the last two except Alfred and the cop. Why not make a new Batman film and call it<br />&quot;Batman 3&quot;. Everyone that worked one the first two like Tim Burton, Michael Keaton and Danny Elfman should work on &quot;Batman 3&quot; to keep the same dark style that we all loved so much. &quot;Batman Forever&quot; and &quot;Batman and Robin&quot;<br />should be left separate as sort of spin-offs from the first two but no real<br />connection. I think the public would be quick to disregard the last two films as they were a totally different genre. Burton, Elfman, and Keaton would be able to<br />make more great sequels to the first two classics.
0316777722|5.0|I have all of David's books - think I'm a bit of a fan?  Yes.  But of them all this was easily my favorite of his collections based primarily on the second half (the book is divided into parts &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Deux&quot;) which recounts his time spent living with a partner/boyfriend in France.  I nearly burst a spleen when he recounted his difficulties with shopping.  David's caustic, observational. and self depricating humor is not for everyone - though everyone I know thinks his stories are laugh out loud funny.  If you've enjoyed any of his earlier works, don't miss out on this one!

B00002Z88E|1.0|I can't believe all the 5 start ratings for this hunk (...).  Metallica hooked me back in the Lightning days, and I was a fan until the Black album.  I can not believe the sell-outs they turned into.  When you start making music just to sell records, it means you sold out.  It's as simple as that.  These guys are ridiculous.  Has any one of you actually listened to the old Master of Puppets?  That used to be the baddest song ever done, but this (...) orchestra is awful.  It sounds like elevator music.  Plus, James Hetfield has decided to TRY to sing now, whereas in the past, he just yelled on key.  Much better back then.<br />I feel sorry for all you poor shmucks.  You just dont realize good music when you hear it.  DO me a favor, pick up a copy of Soulfly - Back to the Primitive, or Slayer - Reign in Blood if you want to hear good music.  Metallica is for losers.
0671024256|5.0|I'm a published writer, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in starting to write seriously, or to a more advanced writer looking to improve his or her skills. This is one of the best books I've ever read on the art and craft of writing. With wit, his characteristic approachable, delightful style, and gut level honesty, Mr. King tells us all exactly how he works and how it can work for you, too. One of the important writing resource books I often suggest to writer friends.
014118213X|5.0|More than a piece of England, Howards End -- the place-- can be seen as a metaphor of the world, and all the people who somehow are related to it, are examples of real human beings. Even though the novel was written almost a  hundred years ago, it is still very suitable for this XXI Century. It seems to me that the story is all about the different moral and background that every class of the society had by that time, and the consequences of it during their lives.<br />The main characters are the two Schlegel Sisters, Margaret and Helen, who are keen on arts, books, philosophy, feminism and other things that have a relation with the soul and the thought. After a misfortunated love affair between Helen and the Paul Wilcox, whose parents they met in a trip to German, their lives change forever. Magaret becomes a close friend to Mrs Wilcox, and her sister starts to despise the family. When Ruth Wilcox dies, she leaves Howads End to her friend, but the Wilcoxes feel betrayed and don't follow up the lady's last will. Years later, Mr Wilcox marries Margaret, and in the very end of the book, after a serie of extremely unpleasant events he tells her that Howards End belongs to her.<br />This brief summary I've just done misses a lot in details and the feeling that anyone only gets reading the novel. There are so many brilliant and subtle nuances in Forster's work. His works bounces from comedy to tragedy in a turn of page. I burst out laughing the first time Helen meets Mrs Bast -- a.k.a.Mrs Lanoline. Sometimes, many things are just left between the lines. For instance, I doubt whether Henry Wilcox feels anything for Margaret but guilt for not telling her about his wife's last will. Personaly speaking, I think he likes and respects her but does not love her until when Charles is arrested, that is when he falls apart, and she is there helping him.<br />As I was saying, I see the whole story as clash between the different cultures that each character have .  The Schlegels may feel very confortable in the XX Century. They are very open minded, enjoy discussing, and were not afraid of showing what they think or fell. On the other hand, the Wilcoxes are very worried about social position and not used to letting women express themselves. And to represent the lowest classes are the Bast : Leonard and Jackie. He likes arts and books, but his older wife prefers the joys of the world - and Mr Wilcox used to know it years ago.<br />The prose is so alive that sometimes I felt extremely agry with some characters, mainly Charles- the oldes Wilcox boy. He is so snobbish, self-centred and xenophibic. For instance, he doesn't face up the fact to that he's killed Mr Bast and after telling the event to his father , they both go and have coffe, as if nothing had happened. Mr Wilcox is the character who goes though the most drastic transformantion, and in the end he is a vey different man, in many senses.<br />Finally, I love the film version of this book. I only regret I hadn't read the book before watching the movie. I think I would have had much more surprises. But, anyway, both book and film are worth reading  or/and watching.feel very confortable in the XX Century.

0060001941|5.0|I first read this book in high school, and remember it to this day.  There is also a well-known movie made from the book which follows the story closely.  The book is the touching tale of a family with 12 children, much spirit and love, and at times very little money.  It's an inspiring, very moving tale that shows how determination, hard work and the love of your family can get you through anything, good times and bad.
B00005U2LM|4.0|Staten Island's intractable collective returns with &quot;Iron Flag,&quot; their latest argument in their hopes to wrest the crown of hip-hop away from others that have usurped the once mighty Wu-Tang throne.  Sporting RZA's best production since &quot;Enter The 36...,&quot;  &quot;Iron Flag&quot; definitely will placate already won-over fans, but the prospect of garnering new converts seems unlikely - beats are standard Diggs's fare - dusty high-pitched soul loops over simple drum patterns (which as usual falter occasionally).  Personally, Method Man still possesses the most distinctive flow and delivery although the rest of the Clan are in fine boasting form, showcasing lyrics that revolve around the Clan's self-perceived state of seige.  A straightforward, solid effort that should sate fans, but may not enable Staten Island's shaolin soldiers from falling prey to the affliction of most rap acts - the dreaded 'no longer in vogue' syndrome.

B00003CXTG|3.0|Given the choice between producing a popular film and a great film, producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Armageddon, Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop, ConAir) will always choose the popular film.  He is nothing if not consistent.  His films always make lots of money and seldom deliver much more than slick eye candy for the masses.  Bruckheimer has a golden opportunity to depart from his blockbuster mentality with this film, but he goes with his business instincts rather than taking a chance with a filmmaker's approach.  The result is another big budget crowd pleaser with a cotton candy plot and terrific battle scenes, aided by impressive digital effects.<br />The script by Randall Wallace of \\"Braveheart\\" fame is the biggest problem.  Wallace is clearly capable of writing an engaging script, but that obviously isn't what the boss wanted.  It seems that Bruckheimer has Titanic envy and tries to use the same formula of wrapping a piece of history around a love story.  Either that or he is trying to follow in the footsteps of \\"From Here to Eternity\\", the much acclaimed 1953 story that occurs as a prelude to the attack on Pearl Harbor.  However, FHTE did not pretend to be a story ABOUT Pearl Harbor, and only included the attack as another disruptive event in an emotionally tumultuous story.  While FHTE was a gripping and powerful story of love, hatred, lust and honor, PH is a trite and predictable love story that serves an interminable prelude to 30 minutes of terrific battle scenes.  The inadvertent love triangle between best friends could have been predicted by a teenager (which seemed to be the target audience of this film, based on the PG rating and the sappy dialogue).  And of course the resolution of the dilemma is just as neat and obvious.  Personally, I would have preferred it if they had killed Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) in the attack and given Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) an opportunity for some real soul searching as they went on their top secret mission.  Butsuch nuance is far too risky for Bruckheimer.<br />Director Michael Bay (Armageddon, The Rock) isn't known for his subtle and insightful direction of human stories.  Bay is known for his explosions, and predictably the human story is bungled while the battle is extraordinary.  Bay directs a period piece without much regard for understanding and reproducing the 1940's.  It seems all he cares about is the military angle.  The costume design and hair for the girls costumes was merely good while the military costumes are perfect.  Mostly, the `40's feel is missing.  The music is all wrong.  It should have been big band music instead of the standard blockbuster symphonic compositions which did not fit the period at all.  Various details are overlooked, like the fact that well more than half of young adults of that era smoked.  Not one character in the film smoked, nor was there a single cigarette to be found in the nightclub scene.  Rent any film from the forties and fifties and notice how many people smoke.  Everybody.  Another thing that is incredible is the fact that Evelyn, who was having morning sickness on December 7 is not showing in mid April, more than four months later.  Perhaps if she were 200 lbs I could believe that, but the lithe Evelyn would have shown more than a little pooch by then.<br />Also missing are the colloquialisms of the day.  Not a single \\"swell\\", \\"dame\\", \\"jeepers\\" or \\"ain't\\" in the whole film.  No Brooklyn or Chicago accents.  Everyone speaks perfect twenty first century Funk and Wagnall's College English.<br />The battle scene is a marvel of action filmmaking.  It is highly realistic as a depiction of the battle, but there was a lot of cheating that didn't escape the notice of WWII buffs.  It is pretty amazing that Bruckheimer got so much cooperation from the US government in being able to film in the Harbor.  The government even loaned the production company numerous mothballed ships.  Unfortunately, a lot of them were ships designed and built after WWII and they didn't bother to clean them up in post production.  They built a complete digital world and left post WWII ships in the picture.  That is just poor attention to detail in a film that is all about detail.  Still, by any standard, this is fantastic action sequence that could not have been more realistic than had one actually been there.<br />The acting is mixed.  Beckingsale is excellent as Evelyn.  She creates a very appealing romantic figure.  Ben Affleck is too moody and sarcastic in the role.  Josh Hartnett is much better, coming across as far more sincere and relating to his character better than Affleck.  Affleck seems content to play Ben Affleck in uniform rather than trying to actually flesh out a character.<br />Cuba Gooding Jr. gives an excellent performance in a minor role.  Veterans Alec Baldwin and Jon Voight do a marvelous job as Colonel Doolitle and FDR.<br />I rated this film a 6/10 on the strength of the visual effects.  It would have been much better if it had been about Pearl Harbor instead of being a schmaltzy love triangle story that coincided with the attack.  The entire event that is Pearl Harbor is shrouded in intriguing questions.  Did Roosevelt know about the attack in advance and allow it to happen to get us into the war?  Many historical facts indicate that was the case (it is thought to be more than just lucky that the aircraft carriers weren't in the harbor that day).  What was really going on in the minds of the Japanese?  Were the diplomatic efforts of the US designed to force the Japanese into attacking us as a matter of honor?  As much as I despise Oliver Stone, this film would have been substantial if it had been done in his docudrama style (without the historical rewrites of course).<br />Instead we have another puff piece by the master of puff.  Thanks Jerry.

B000056VIY|4.0|So Jennifer Lopez isn't the greatest singer or songwriter in the world. Big deal. What makes her awesome is her genuine in enthusiasm for her music. This album is constantly in my cd player at home, and with me at the gym. It's got awesome dance tunes (Play, I'm Real) and of course, Lopez's staple latin style (Carino, Ain't It Funny) and even some tracks you don't know how to qualify (Dame, That's not me, That's the way). I love this cd for it's energy, it's just so much fun to listen to. Pop it in and have a good time with it... Jen's never claimed to be a serious, hardcore musical artist, so don't expect it from her, but she gives her all not matter what she's doing, and i think she's done it again.<BR>Best Song- Si Ya Se Acabo, Play<BR>Needs Work-Walking on Sunshine
0525946284|5.0|The book reminded me of Ken Follet's earlier books, ex Eye of the Needle, Key to Rebecca.  I was pleased to see that he has returned to his original style of writing.  I very much enjoyed the book.  It only took me a couple of days to read.   I would recommend this book.
B00000J7RZ|4.0|If you've seen my review of J.Lo, you'll remember me saying Jennifer Lopez never claimed to be this big, serious singer/songwriter, so let's not treat her like one... Now, having said that, Jen's ambitious On the 6 is Jen trying her damndest (and tripping over her feet occasionally) to do just one more  thing really well. And you know what? she almost does it. Thank her team of writers, producers, Marc Anthony etc.. for that, but Jen's got drive and she's gonna keep on trying. Waiting for tonight is beautiful, thumping beats, gorgeous vocals, and that danceable beat that drags you to the dance floor. Feelin So Good is a great anthem for anyone whose having a good day, or even a bad day. Stumbing blocks for Lopez- Promise me You'll Try, where she struggles to hit those high note. Potential &quot;Ballad Princess&quot; track- Talk about Us and No Me Ames, cuz when Jen gets the right key, there's no stopping her. Most fun tracks-Open off my love, Let's Get Loud.<BR>Let's give Jen a break, she's trying, and she'll keep on trying til she nails it. I'm proud to say i'm a fan, and i hope when she makes disc numero 3, she'll have figured out exactly what works for her, and blow the critics out of the water.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney rocks. (...) Britney can sing. This Album rocks. I love it. Ever since I got I have been listening to it over and over again. \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" (which is a song about being a slave to music by the way) is a great song to dance to. I really love \\"Overprotected\\", that is an awesome song and so is \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" and \\"That's Where You Where You Take Me\\". Anyone who likes Britney Should get this. (...) BRITNEY ROCKS!!!(...)
B00003CX5P|4.0|All right, I agree - Star Wars Episode I has many unforgivable flaws. If you pay close attention to the plot, you will notice many flaws that I can't belive George Lucas allowed to happen. I am not going to list all of the movie's shortcomings since any Star Wars fan knows them anyway (Jar Jar Binks anyone?). <br />However, despite all of its flaws, the movie simply is amazing. With todays technology this is arguably the best visual spectacle ever created. Everyone will agree that the lightsabre fights are out of this world - a reason enough to own the DVD. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGreggor make great jedis, and young Anakin handled his role very well, despite some &quot;Yippie&quot; comments - but this is the fault of the script, not the actor. Even Jar Jar Binks, while painfully annoying at the start, grew on me and is much more tolerable now.
B00005RDAE|5.0|I love this video. It is a great video and who cares if it doesn't have a lot of videos it is still a collectable and is A MUST FOR ALL BRITNEY FANS especially those who don't have cable and can't get the videos-&quot;Don't Let Me Be The Last To know, &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot;, &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot; and Overprotected (with scenes of the her movie Crossroads)and it even has the &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot; performance from the 2001 MTV Video Awards and the Making of Crossroads and of course her famous Pepsi Commercial (the long version). THIS IS AN AWESOME VIDEO-I recommend it-especially if you want to see a bigger Overprotected video (what I mean is that the one that is included with her CD is a little to small)!!!<BR>GO OUT AND BUY THIS VIDEO AND THE CD IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT ALREADY!!!<BR>BRITNEY ROCKS!!!!
B000002P86|3.0|I love BB, but this album swamps BB with its all star cast and misses the mark. The album ends up presenting an R&amp;B front rather than the blues. While I enjoy some of the tracks such as 'The thrill is gone' with Tracy Chapman, in general it disapppoints. The absolute lowlight is BB contributing to a rap song.
B00005AQF7|5.0|In my eyes, the greatest album ever recorded. Each of the albums tracks remain classics from beggining to end. One of the first rap albums i ever bought, so it lasted 7 years and still is certified of gettin a play. i never let this album go dusty underneath the Nelly's and Ludacris' which have pushed older albums off the shelves. My favourite track of all time is also on this album, the classic Who Am I. I think classic is the only word to describe each track on this, reading off it is like reading a greatest hip hop songs ever track listing. Songs all hiphop fans have heard...Gin and Juice, Lodo Dodi, Murder Was The Case, Ain't no Fun, Doggy Dogg World. One thing that makes this album so good is how i can press play and just sit back and not have to do anything. No having to skip filler tracks, no having to skip annoying interludes. Though there are skits, they are either too short to have to bother, funny or are related to the song as with the skit before Murder Was The Case. This is a must have for every hip hop fan anywhere, anyone who has ever thought about buying a hip hop album to see whut the music genre is about should make this the album to buy. Dre's classic production, Snoop's ever recognisable flow with appearance from Daz, Kurupt, Lady of Rage, Nate Dogg and Warren G. what more could any hip hop fan ask for?
B00005QDW1|4.0|Well well well!  I now see who the real No Doubt fans are!  All of you that say that the cd is horrible don't know how much Gwen and the band needed this cd.  Instead of being a deep deep band for one cd, they venture into just having fun!  I am sick of hearing SELLOUT at every turn when the bands decide to try a new sound.  The sound on the Rock Steady cd are balanced and catchy while doing exactly what they have always done.  They have not &quot;stole&quot; the sound of hip hop or Jamaica, they just like the beat and the feel.  I admit, Hey Baby is not the breakthrough song of the year, but it does give you a good feeling inside.  Do you want every good band out there to copy their previous works so they won't be called a sellout?  Gwen is having fun and that is what matters.  I was never too fond of Return of Saturn but I stuck it through.  The best still is their self-titled because of the true punk/ska feel of it, but Rock Steady is still going to stay in my cd player for a while.
B0000024ZC|5.0|The opener Prologue starts with the best drum roll ever which leads into an inventive extended riff/theme. The song verses contains some interesting alternately voiced vocal effects and a trademark \\"And now for something completely different\\" middle section. These sections don't always work, the song \\"Think of me with Kindness\\" from Octopus is a beauty sullied by the same tendency, but in Prologue it works for me. It's as perfect an example of a marriage of whimsical organ, synth, bass, guitar and gentle drumming I've ever heard, the song fades out to the opening theme.<br />Next up is Schooldays, a perfect evocation of the experience of a genteel holiday spent at a British Seaside resort, think St Ives, Penzance, Aldeburgh rather than Blackpool. So nostalgic it transports me to my childhood/adolescence every time I hear it. Exquisite jazz tinged Guitar/Vibraphone interplay, and nice soft vocals eventually give way to a velvety, double-chocolate Grand-Piano section during which Kerry Minnear goes all \\"Slow Movement Concerto on us\\". Here he demonstrates that he can do melody as well as anyone. This progresses to a fast jazzy section and an ending only Giant could have conceived. If you know this song and you've heard it 1000 times already, listen again and focus on Ray Shulman's bass playing, it's out of this World!<br />Working all day is announced with a contrapuntal passage which has had a variable pitch-shift trick played on it by a tape machine. It's a good enough song, heavy production coupled with Derek Shulman singing as only he could, like Peter Gabriel with Balls. I don't have much else to say about it except it contains the best Organ solo I've ever heard. It's totally emotive and used to make my spine tingle every listen in my younger days, and still touches a nerve. Why did Kerry Minnear never bother much with emotive Hammond solos after this? Apart from a brief flirtation in the middle section of \\"Playing the Game\\" from \\"The Power and the Glory\\", duringwhich the Organ sounds like an early solid-state attempt to recreate the Hammond sound to me. In my mind, the Working all Day Organ solo sounds like a full-on love affair and any subsequent solos say,\\"I won't get hurt like that again\\".<br />Peel the Paint shows us early Giant Rocking at their best. OK, the riff doesn't fit under the hands as well as a Zeppelin riff, but augmented by the Macho Sax and Hammond and benefiting from a heavier production than later albums, it oozes power from every pore. Derek Shulman gives a rip-roaring almost wreckless performance and the Guitar/Drum solo.... When I was younger, I used to think this solo must have been scored it's so good, now I'm of the opinion that it must have evolved from several takes in the studio, surely it couldn't be just one take. I like the big ending to this song as well, they didn't do this often and generally I'm not a big fan of big endings, but this one is just right.<br />The intro to Mister Class and Quality starts with a quote from the Three Friends which is the next track. If I was being picky, I'd say that the intro doesn't gel with the rest of the song but I've grown to love it, like a Cat with 3 legs and a limp. The song proper is moderately paced and foursquare with a nice Derek Shulman vocal. Midway through, you get the sense the band have a few tricks up their collective sleeves as they set the scene for a carefully chaotic instrumental section. This is proceeding very nicely when out of nowhere, even though it's been hinted at before, comes a comical synth passage which culminates when most of the the rest of the band stop playing and the synth plays an ascending arpeggio ending on a long note. Don't ask me what it is it about this that is so unique, so Giant and so unexpected? It's like under-stated slapstick and so bloody funny. After this, comes a quasi-improvisational section containing some nice blues Guitar, the section gets a bit blurred as if it's screaming for resolution, even thoughit doesn't outstay it's welcome. It's rescued by the 3rd and final verse, the last line of which sounds to me particularly plaintive, the instrumental suffix of the verse leads directly into the last song.<br />If Schooldays was the memory of a Holiday, Three Friends conjures The Beach complete with Seagulls, Waves, Deckchairs, people laughing and flying Kites, as well as Afternoon Cream-Tea, Ice-cream and even the bag of chips at the end of the day. With the Organ set firmly on the \\"Coastal Resort\\" Voice and the Strings sounding to me like they've been carefully voiced with the Organ part (I might be wrong), the Hymnal harmonies conjure up a moment of pure nostalgia. This is one track which even Giant can't write an end for; they have to repeat and fade-out in the yearning outro to end all yearning outros.
B00005JKES|5.0|I won't try to sell you on the series in this review.  I just want to say that this is, flat out, the best that Twin Peaks has ever looked (unless of course you were David Lynch and had the original master copies.) <br />Before the series was released on DVD, we had two options: We could either watch the high quality VHS version of the first season, or we could watch the low quality VHS version of both seasons.  The first season boxed set was pretty good--you even got to see the &quot;previously on Twin Peaks&quot; montage, but it only covered the first seven episodes of the show.  The complete box set had quality issues as all of the episodes were crammed onto 6 tapes--gone were the &quot;previously on Twin Peaks&quot; montage and  there were issues with the picture/sound quality.  Boo!  <br />But I have received the DVDs and just love them.  The show looks outstanding.  If you want to share Twin Peaks with someone this DVD set is the way to do it--just a spectacular looking picture with great sound and no picture issues.  Overall, Artisan did a great job and I would highly recommend the set to anyone looking for a high quality copy of the first season.
020161622X|3.0|The title &quot;The Pragmatic Programmer&quot; is very apt.  Not a book written by a professor for teaching, this book is written by actual programmers to be read and used by actual programmers.  There is a wealth of sound practical advice, and a gift for the memorable phrase or anecdote.  I found this book to be a useful refresher, and well worth reading.  The writing style is excellent - clear, entertaining, appropriate level of humour.<br />However I've given it only three stars.  My favourite book on programming, &quot;Code Complete&quot; by Steve McConnell, is equally readable, but covers similar ground in far more depth.  I make Code Complete required reading for my programming teams.  The Pragmatic Programmer doesn't make it past &quot;Suggestions for further reading&quot;.
B000007MVM|1.0|Over the years, I have heard so many Floyd phoenatics flaunt this album and Syd as a masterpiece.  So many consider \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" to be Floyd's magnum opus as well as a work of genious.  Huh?!?  I am a Floyd fan.  Had all theirs on vinyl up until 1986, have their solo works.  Having said that, Barrett's departure (although unfortunately due to personal problems on his behalf of which I feel bad about) from Pink Floyd and his replacement (David Gilmour) are the best things to happen to Floyd and it saved Floyd from dying as a band in 1968/1969.  Those who say Barrett is the icon and the legendary figure of the band don't fool me.  His goofey lyrics and corny pop melodies sound rediculous at best.  For me, Floyd started as a band with \\"Saucerful of Secrets\\".  I had this on vinyl and tried to listen to this quite a few times.  It just got worse and worse with every listen and it finally made its way on a garage sale display.  Nobody bought it so I ended up getting 35 cents for it (and it was in mint shape) from a record exchange store that buys used vinyl.  35 cents is about all it's worth.  There was nothing redeeming about it.  The best part of the album is when it ends or when you stop it.    Syd Barrett may have had some mental problems (and I feel bad for it) and a tragic life.  I sympathize with him.  Musically though, he was a disaster and so is this album.  If you want early Floyd, skip \\"Piper\\" and get \\"Ummagumma\\".    Also, on many occassions, Floyd fans tell me I don't like Barrett because I can't understand him and am not capable of understanding what Syd was trying to portray (as if Syd is only for sophisticated folks).  When I say \\"No, I don't understand, please try and explain\\", I usually get no reply back from them.
0783225733|5.0|Everything about this movie is fantastic.  There's a great story, great acting, and extremely realistic special effects.  I was amazed at how I was at the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie, even though I knew how it turned out.  Ron Howard did an unbelievable job of keeping up the suspense.  Enough about the movie though, everyone has seen it.<br />All of the extras on the DVD are fantastic.  However, if you're a history buff, and a stickler for historical accuracy, then the commentary with Jim and Marilyn Lovell is what you are looking for.  They go through the entire movie and clear up any embellishments made to improve the &quot;story&quot;.  Most surprisingly you find out that things you thought were made up, are actually true.  It was a very interesting addition.<br />Fantastic all around DVD.  If I didn't own one DVD, I would consider this a candidate for my first.  MUST HAVE!
B00003CXUM|2.0|I can't understand all the hype. This movie was quite booring. As I left the theater another man and I looked at each other and said &quot;what was that?&quot; I'll give it 5 stars for beautiful shots, but the unrequited love thing didn't appeal to me and it went nowhere. Don't bother unless you can see it for free. And then maybe do it on an empty stomach so you will fall asleep.
B00005JKES|5.0|David Lynch's reputation grows with this DVD boxed set review.  Without once appearing on camera, there are many more than happy to wax lyrical about his massive influence upon their careers.  <br />Dozens of the shows stars appear in brief interviews to discuss their memories of the show.  It is very interesting to see how they have changed, or not in some cases, over the 12 years period since series one was filmed.<br />The show content itself?  Outstanding.  After recently selling off my VHS collection, I was eagerly awaiting this first DVD release.  I know it was bigger in the US than over here in Scotland, but no programme has ever had a bigger effect on me than Twin Peaks.  Anyone interested in buying this item will no doubt already have seen the legendary show, or at least been given a hearty recommendation from someone who has.<br />This is not available in the UK yet so I was grateful to purchase it on amazon.com, I am VERY keen to know when the second series will be launched in a similar crystal clear format.<br />THANKS!!
B00005B4GU|4.0|After album number two, Radiohead began its quest to stop spoon feeding the masses with the usual rock/pop fare. \\"Amnesiac,\\" an insular, more coldly recorded and produced Radiohead CD than any prior to it, may represent the apex of that goal. The album takes some getting used to, but it's worth discovering if you like music from these guys. The slow, synthetic groove of \\"Packt Like Sardines...\\"; the lush piano and swaying melody of \\"Pyramid Song\\"; the sheer overprocessed weirdness of \\"Pulk/Pull\\" -- this was Radiohead at an interesting moment in the band's history. Despite obscure-sounding song titles, \\"Amnesiac\\" is full of strangely comforting sounds for the 21st century that, once they fully resonate, make for great music. If you can get past some of the meandering moments and Thom Yorke's occasional caterwaul, it really is good stuff.<br /><br />Needless to say, Radiohead continued on an evolving path with \\"Amnesiac.\\" The record doesn't boast the tuneful guitar crunch of [[ASIN:B000002UR7 Pablo Honey]] and [[ASIN:B000002TQV The Bends]], nor does it show off the ambition or convey the opus-like feel of [[ASIN:B000002UJQ OK Computer]] and [[ASIN:B00004XONN Kid A]]. What it does possess, however, is an experimental vibe and a strange magnetism that makes it irresistible in the end. Additionally, the CD does have a few easy-on-the-ears, radio-ready tracks like \\"I Might be Wrong\\" and \\"Knives Out,\\" so listeners won't feel completely alienated. Along those lines, the vocally gorgeous \\"Morning Bell\\" is a stunner that can also be heard as a longer, less rough version on the great \\"Kid A\\" album.<br /><br />Interestingly, as \\"Amnesiac\\" winds down, it gets more organic and free-flowing. \\"Hunting Bears\\" is a sparse solo guitar number that comes from left field, and the closer, \\"Life in a Glasshouse,\\" with its slinky piano and intermittent trumpet, feels like the atmosphere of a downtown Chicago bar at 2:30 a.m. With Radiohead, even the lulling, potentially dull, songs have a way of sneaking into your consciousness with a hidden melody or cool sonic moment that gets you coming back for more. \\"Amnesiac\\" is chock full of such moments.of sneaking into your consciousness with a hidden melody or cool sonic moment that gets you coming back for more. \\"Amnesiac\\" is chock full of such moments.
B00003CXZ4|1.0|Totally unrealistic and stupid.   The tattoo concept was so dumb!
B00004THAY|2.0|This CD was a huge disappointment to me as I was really expecting something great.  Instead, this is really a very middling effort for these two masters.  Some of the tunes (Marry You sticks out like a sore thumb) are downright hard to listen to.  Of course there a few good numbers on here,  but on the whole this is a very disappointing effort.
B000002MZ6|5.0|I've been an Oldfield fan for a long time, and this is the album that got me into his music. It's really a shame that most people who classify themselves as Oldfield fans will tell you that this work isn't good. This album has Oldfield's remarkable genius woven through it, but unlike his other works, it uses a lot of synth and has a very distinct, fluid sci-fi feel to it, making it different enough to earn the ire of some of his earlier fans who got hooked on the likes of Amarok and Ommadawn. Don't get me wrong, the synth is fantastic and used to enrich the music, not overwhelm it as with most sci-fi music. The guitar work is outstanding, definite trademark Oldfield, the themes beautiful, and the music very original and non-repetitive. I often use this CD to introduce people to Mike's music. Even friends I have who seldom listen to anything but longhair classical or heavy metal can't resist this album, it nails everyone every time. If you are reading this, take a chance and pick it up, even if you don't think you would like it. Listen to it a few times, as with all Oldfield's music, it takes time to reveal itself to you. I'd place it as his best work, but I'm in a very small minority of Oldfield fans on that. If at least two of the sound clips intrigue you, definitely pick it up and give it a shot. Grock the net for &quot;Pat's Mike Oldfield Page&quot; if you want to view the definitive website on Oldfield's work.
B00005QG9J|4.0|if you lie incubus' less-edgy work (i.e stellar, drive, pardon me...) you'll like this album a lot. its sorta mellow, very introspective. great music.
0316779237|1.0|Sedaris writes in the same style as Nick Hornby but his stories aren't nearly as humorous or interesting.  I found 'Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!!' to be particularly annoying and disturbing. I was going to give this book as a Christmas present, but after reading it, I threw it in the garbage.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|This is a phenomenal film... for the love god people just buy it!
B000000H57|5.0|...would have been an equally appropriate title for October Rust.  You don't normally think of &quot;metal&quot; as being music to seduce a woman by, but this album brings that old assuption into question.  Lush, atmospheric soundscapes and dark, sensual lyrics over a backbone of slow, heavy riffs topped with Peter Steele's trademark &quot;deep-enough-to-make-your-girlfriend-swoon&quot; vocals pervade here.  Present also is another Type O trademark:  a tounge-in-cheek lack of complete seriousness, sarcastic irony delivered with a completely straight face.<br />My personal picks on this album are &quot;Love You to Death,&quot; &quot;My Girlfriend's Girlfriend,&quot; &quot;Cinnamon Girl,&quot; &quot;Wolf Moon,&quot; and &quot;Haunted.&quot;  But those are only my favorites.  The entire album is great, listenable music, ideal stuff if you're looking to &quot;ease&quot; a non-metal friend or sweetheart into this, the greatest of all music genres.<br />The key to this album's greatness is the fact that it stands the test of time.  After four, five years, this CD still gets frequent rotation in my home and on the road... especially when I'm out to set a mood...
B00003CY0V|3.0|Lets face it folks- this movie has very little in the way of a plot, and even less in the way of depth. Nonetheless, its a good movie to drop in after a long day @ work. There are plenty of explosions, cool toys and attractive women to entertain me for an hour or so. Also, its an impressive home theater film, esp the opening scene. Of course, if you're looking for a film with any sort of meaning or artistic value, dont buy it.
6300184269|5.0|this movie is so good, i am almost in tears thinking about all the great times i've spent watching it. I can watch this movie a thousand times and never get tired of it. Anthony Michael Hall totally ruled this movie. I am speechless. Buy this movie NOW!!!!! it's a movie party!!!!
0385015364|5.0|Like C.S. Lewis, G.K. Chesterton is one of the greatest apologists of all time. &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; is a masterpiece of Christian literature, my favourite part being the chapter on paradoxes. <br />Only the most ingrained skeptics won't find intelligent and useful insights in this book, but that's because they refuse to find anything insightful in any Christian's work. <br />G.K. Chesterton has a great sense of humour, a wonderful style of prose, and is clearly a most amazing thinker and a uniquely brilliant Christian. I highly recommend it to all honest seekers &amp; thinkers.
0375703764|3.0|While I enjoyed this book, I can't say that this is &quot;fiction that makes all others seem less important.&quot; Having unique, changing type-face is not new: William Gass &amp; Georges Perec. The story itself of HOL is reminiscent of Nabokov's Pale Fire &amp; Jorge Luis Borges' Ficciones or Labyrinth. The relationship of Reader Writer Character is tested in most of these works, usually involving a corrupted or unreliable narrator (with exception of Perec).<BR>The book is good, I just don't think it has &quot;perfected&quot; anything, or that it is &quot;eons&quot; ahead of all fiction. Mr. Danielewski has written a solid, entertaining book with glimpses into the horror &amp; isolation within man's heart &amp; mind. A solid 3 stars (I rarely give anything more than three).
B00004U8JV|5.0|Nothing can top the first one, but this is worthy enough to follow it. If you want to see the real sequel to Jurassic Park, then this is it.  If you want to be sit though a bad movie then I suggest seeing Jurassic Park 3.
B00004Y2FT|5.0|As far as I know, this title is only available as an import, going for around 25 bucks. It is worth every cent of your money. Greatest hit collections appeal to me because I don't have the budget to get every release by my favorite bands and in this particular case, I couldn't be happier having shelled out more than average money for this insanely great collection. The track listing is chronological but the Cocteau Twins retain their unique wall of sound throughout, it sounds like all of the songs were created within the same space of time. The liner notes are almost as warm and majestic as the music itself as well. There isn't one bum song on the whole thing, it's just a constant flow of beautiful and alien soundscapes with the most heavenly voice ever recorded floating in and out. I'm so in awe to actually own this, to actually have all of these wonderful songs on one CD, that I'm out of words to explain anything. It is spectacular.
B00003CXXS|1.0|It has to be one of the worst movies ever made, and the fact that a few people even likes this film is even more scary. To those people, I really feel sorry for you. You probably never saw a good movie in you life.
B000002IKR|5.0|Before I started listening to Testament, I judged all thrash by early Metallica, up to and including ...And Justice For All. All I can say is that when I popped this album into my stereo, it about knocked me over. And the ferocious opening to Over The Wall was just the beginning. This puppy thrashed and smashed for the entire 38:55. I could not believe it. Here was a band that made Metallica look like ametuers. Hell, they made every other thrash band in existence look like ametuers. Eric Peterson's riffage puts Hetfield to shame and Alex Skolnick makes Hammet's leads sound dated. Louie Clemente easily puts Lars  to shame. But I will not compare bass players since I have too much respect for Cliff. And Chuck Billy screams like a madman especially on The Haunting and Apocolyptic City (my personal fav.) Other good tracks include Raging Waters, Alone in the Dark (kick @$$ intro) and Burnt Offerings. And I don't care what anyone says, these guys don't sound generic. If they write like this for their next album... It could happen, too, with Alex back in the mix. So don't hesitate to pick this baby up. And if you like it, get The New Order as well.
B00005JKES|3.0|I have to reiterate what a lot of these reviews say.  I bought the box expecting &quot;The First season,&quot; but what I got was &quot;The First Season Excluding the necessary, informative pilot.&quot;<BR>  The big problem I have is this: why burn the fans?  I would expect about 90% of the people buying this would be Twin Peaks fans who can recite the quirky dialogue.  These are die-hard viewers who have suffered with the VHS version long enough.  The DVD's look great, there's no complaining there.  <BR>   These fans will keep Twin Peaks alive and popular for years to come, why spite them?  Why rip them off?  Why deceive them with this phony &quot;First Season?&quot;<BR>   Being a fan, yes, I will buy the pilot if and when they release it.  Will I be happy? No.  Will I praise the money-hungry studio execs who pine for my every dollar? No.  Will I continue to be a fan? Yes.  Do I respect the series? No.  <BR>   Apologies are needed all around, and you can start with the fans.
B000000JO3|5.0|this cd is so good. every song on it is amazing. every punk should own this cd.
B0000039QA|5.0|Featuring one of the best rappers of all time, Notorius BIG, and one of the best entertainers of all time, Puff Daddy/P-Diddy, this album may be one of the best hip-hop albums ever. It features two legitimate hits, Mo Money Mo Problems and Hypnotize.
B00000CQJZ|1.0|LaserLight's DVD of &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; has low sound, but that I could tolerate.  Every 1-2 minutes, the DVD skips several frames, causing the picture to freeze for a few seconds &amp; the sound to be lost, losing a word or two of dialog each time it occurs during speech.  Because I'd read a favorable review of this version, &amp; because my LaserLight DVD of &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; plays fine, I thought it might be just one defective DVD.  I tried a different seller--with the exact same defective results.<BR>My DVD player has had no problems with any other DVDs I've played on it.
B000059XY5|3.0|Ok , I liked this movie quite a lot: the batsuit , batmobile , and the way batman is played . But . hey , that doesny amount to an all round great movie , i was shocked when i read some reviews for this movie. It isnt 'great' or 'amazing , in fact it is poor. Do people forget that special effects and costumes do make a blockbuster? take the blair witch project. The villains are played poorly and have no real sense of evil especially catwoman who barely has a say. what about penguin? please!! danny de vito is annoying and frustrating in the role and his cause of death still confuses me - he seems to spit out some black stuff and die can someone enlighten me on this. is this intentional or is it a copout , more importantly is it a perfect example of how this movie was thrown together without regard for true batfans who want bats to stop being so two dimensional and solve crimes instead of just showing up out of the blue for no reason but to kill a couple of circus baddies. Michelle pffiefer may look good but has no depth or feelings. And the climax is a true......well........anticlimax . Please!!!!!!! hundreds of penguins with rockets tied to their backs! its embarassing and while selina lives we never hear of her ever again. michal keaton tries but fails and at the end of the film plays no part in penguin or catwomans dowmfall except to show his true identitiy for the sake of it, and wheres robin? . bruce and selinas romance is doomed from the start and their is no way their will be a happy ending for any character least of all bruce. this movie is sad not only because their is hardly any humor or happiness and not only because this movie is a lesson in how to make a movie make lots of money and hope no one notices how flawed it is but because had this movie have had afew tweaks before it was let out it could have been somuch better , only buy this if you have the first , the next too are much better.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Can you say &quot;here to last&quot;? It's obvious by this album that Britney Spears is here to stay for the long haul.  The third album entitled simply &quot;Britney&quot; is the most mature material to date from America's pop diva. The title explains it all, this album is all about Britney and truely reflects her as a person and proves herself as an artist. The album starts with a bang with the indie heavy beat first single &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot;. The lyrics clearly states that she's no longer a little girl, and proves this with the next song and future single &quot;Overprotected&quot; where she claims how &quot;overprotected&quot; and &quot;shut in&quot; she is. Then Britney goes into a rock driven song &quot;Lonley&quot; where so ohh and ahhhs her way along. On the contrary the next song &quot;Not a Girl, Not Yet a Women&quot; is the mega ballard Britney has always wanted and now can finally sing this mature piece co-written by UK's leading lady, Dido. Then Britney transitions into a funky Mariah Carey Loverboyish song &quot;Boys&quot; which Britney claims might be a future single. Although no definate chorus jumps out, it clearly relies on catchy lyrics and driven beats. &quot;Anticipating&quot; penned by Spears is a bubble gum pop old school Britney song and sound. Her version of &quot;I Love Rock and Roll&quot;, produced by R&amp;B producecer Rodney Jerkins, follows. Spears tries her hardest to put on her rock and roll edge and does it well. &quot;Cinderella&quot;, another Spears penned song is obviously a filler, but, however is an excelent song with catchy lyrics and fresh beats. When I hear &quot;Let Me Be&quot;,the next on the list, I can't help but think of Michael Jackson's &quot;Leave me Alone&quot;. It's the same idea. &quot;Bombastic Love&quot; is next track. Although an odd title, the song proves refeshing and quite well done. Second to last is &quot;Where You Take Me&quot;. This is one of the less great songs on the album. With cheesy lyrics and breathy vocals, it's not a high scorer. Lastly &quot;What It's Like To Be Me&quot; written by Beu Justin Timberlake and co-written by choreographer/friend Wade Robson is and unbelievable colaberation where Justin provides back-up vocals.  This is no doubt, next to &quot;Not a Girl&quot;, the album's star track. All in all, Ms. Spears has done it again, and, as i predict, will do it again for many weeks to come. My best wishes and prayers to her and her family.
B00005U122|5.0|I was amazed watching this great concert. Sound and picture quality is good enough.Camera shows team players from different<BR>points so you can see all of them. Technicaly players are very well armed so everyone can make a solo.Roger has gathered most buityfull songs from most famous albums - &quot;Dark side of the moon&quot;,&quot;The Wall&quot;, &quot;Animals&quot; and so on.Plus there are some new<BR>songs too.I can watch it over and over again.I'd like Roger<BR>to issue more DVD's.
0385505833|2.0|thought it would be a great novel, since grisham is amazing, but wound up falling asleep w/in the first 20 pgs.  woke up, gave it a second chance, thinking it would be a cute little book, but just got irritated the more i read.  sorry.  i love john grisham, but this is one i wouldn't recommend, esp. if you've read his other books.
B00000J6AG|4.0|I don't know where I've been but I missed Moby along the way. I caught him, Jill Scott and Blue Man Group on an award show last year and really enjoyed it so picked up this CD. I can understand why so many advertisers buy up the rights to use even snips of his material. Though I usually find tech music rather cold, I feel a spirit and warmth behind the beat. I also recognized a few melodies from commercials. Enjoyable to listen to when driving. . . almost mandatory to be played loud so you can feel it and hear the texture of the music.

0962477060|1.0|&quot;Reading&quot; this book like reading &quot;Philosophy&quot; book. It contains so much theory and Logic without much of anything else such as something to use it on or how to apply to &quot;Music&quot;. Not much showing you &quot;how to make music&quot; but &quot;how music/guitar works&quot;. It just plain dead mind messing. Don't waste money on them. Very disappointed after reading others review and buying them.

B00003W8NM|5.0|This is a very good movie, but if you can't stomach violence and look past it to the deeper meaning of the film, then don't watch it.  The movie is very well cast and very well directed.  The story is entertaining and fast moving. <br />But this movie should make you think.  It has a strict anti-materialism message to it that makes it rather intriguing (whether or not you agree).  How many of us men in our late twentys - early thirtys have spent considerable time searching for the larger meaning of our lives?  We have had soft lives with no great challenges and this movie really chronicals a group of men searching for a primal challenge and searching for an opportunity to be primative.  It encourages people to break away from who they are (or who they have become) and turn into who they want to be.  I will say that the creation of a &quot;cult-army&quot; of mislead souls was, to me, the most disturbing aspect of the movie - much more so than the violence.<br />This is a great movie - it should have won best picture if the Academy had any guts - but it is violent and disturbing for both the violence and other reasons and shouldn't be watched by people who don't want what they know to be real to be confronted.
0671027344|5.0|Smart and Witty, I am a 14 yr old boy, and i could really see alot of things that happened to Charlie happen to several of my friends. I don't think all of the bad things in his life can happen to someone, but it might. I started reading this on a Tues. and couldn't put it down, i read all through the Christmas parties at my school and i finished it today. It was truly amazing and had alot of interesting things in it. I would suggest this book to anyone over 12.
B000000XB9|5.0|People occasionally ask what 3 albums I'd want with me if I were stranded on a desert island.  Well, I'd have to think about #2 and #3, but this disc would definitely be #1.<br />Why?  Well, although the 20 tracks on this album were released before I was born, each one of them sounds as fresh to me today as anything I hear.  Backed up by solid musical composition and performance, the lyrics relate to enduring facets of the human experience.  I think these songs would do just as well if they were released for the first time today as they did in the late 1960's.  CCR's songs are more than just Classic Rock; they are timeless classics.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This is a great rock album! I got it on a whim (after hearing the name-dropping of the band's name over the past few months) and I've found that I can't stop listening to this CD.  Sure there's Velvet Underground influence here, but you can also hear bits of the Clash, the Pixies, the Cure, Morrissey, and even Guided By Voices in the rhythms and jammin' melodies.  Great tunes that'll make you glad you found this diamond in these rough, slick, and over-produced times.
0393317552|5.0|I really enjoyed this one, as I am in the select group of thinkers similar. I strongly agree as science is in fact hard cold facts of life whether social or physical. We live in a fair world of the physical sciences but an unfair world of our social desires, which have been weighed and unfairly balanced, fate has been partially determined. I especially agree with the Euro influences spoken of by Jared. What has me happy with this book is that here is a person not afraid to break mainstream thought, tell it like it really is and be able to capture the mainstream reader. I must highly recommend another book (Which has this Scientific thinking but adventurous) that you should not be fooled by the title, Karl Mark Maddox, SB 1 or God
0385484518|2.0|Tuesdays With Morrie disappointed me for several reasons.  Although Morrie Schwartz obviously has many lessons for the world, I quickly tired of hearing them in &quot;fortune cookie&quot; form.  Albom's utter idolization of Morrie is annoying.  In fact, by the time I finished reading TWM a second time I was livid with Mitch Albom marginalizing Morrie into an old man who randomly belts out a proverb.<BR>    I was interested at first, but after a few chapters the lessons blur and Albom's arrogance becomes intolerable. Albom moans and whines about how much he sacrifices to visit his old professor.  All I can see is how hopelessly self-centered Mitch really is.  Mitch mentions how he continued to bring food to  Morrie for months after Morrie stopped eating normal food.  How oblivious and rude can one be?<BR>    There are important lessons taught by Morrie Schwarz, lessons everyone should take to heart and teach to others.  Unfortunately it appears that Mitch Albom is a very poor student.
B000002U82|5.0|1973.Dark Side of the Moon,how could you rave anymore about this mind-blowing MASTERPIECE.From generation to generation,people keep on discovering this monumental recording.Enough said because it keeps proving itself year after year,generation after generation!1975.Wish You Were Here,WOW!This recording is another awsome C.D.from start to finish.Not as physcedellic as DSOTM but it still remains one of their best.1979.Along comes The Wall to impress some soon to be Floyd fans.There are maybe two songs or sound effects I could live without but it is classic all around.If I was starting out buying Pink Floyd C.D.s these are the 3 I would recommend purchasing to anyone.The 70,s were Floyds most productive and best years for them ever.LONG LIVE ROCKANDROLL!!
0446677450|4.0|This book is interesting because many times I hear that if I study hard, I will make it big in life, but after reading this book, I realized that I have to learn how to make money, not just be smart.  This book made me think about certain things and made me realize that I have a lot to learn about the world of money.
B00005JKES|4.0|I absolutely loved this series and am happy to be able to get some of it on DVD.  (I still have a copy of &quot;Laura Palmers Diary&quot;)  But it's been WAY too long since I saw the pilot, and it wasn't included in this set!  It _really_ needs to be offered as another DVD.
B00004U5SC|5.0|Great movie with wonderful cinematography. I have been to Jackson Hole several times and to see the Tetons will take your breath away. This movie has it all action, suspence, a plot and good acting. Alan Ladd put up a terrific performance all should enjoy. The last scene always brings tears to my eyes as little joey calls for shane to come back. It hits to close to home for when i was a boy of 9 my father left my mother and me and I called to him from our street corner only to see him drive away never to write or call me.
034537410X|5.0|I have noticed that many of the lucid dreaming books are new age  airy-fairy fluff...and lose a lot of credibility..This is the classic, a majority of the books on lucid dreaming are spin-offs of the ideas contained in this book.   If you seriously trying to learn how to have lucid dreams...this is the source.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is one of the few movies that I have found myself watching twice in the movies, and I also own the soundtrack.  It's a spectacular journey and it is a beautiful movie.  Both McGregor and Kidman are great and their singing causes goosebumps.  If you think the movie is kind of weird in the beggining, just sit still, it's great.  The costumes and the scenery are eye-popping.  The DVD has some great features and it's one of the best DVDs I own.  The full dance sequences are breathtaking and a wonder.  The DVD also includes insightful interviews from the main actors and Baz Luhrman who has truly created an amazing masterpiece!
B00005AQGH|5.0|Two months after the tragic death of one of rap musics greatest talents, the 7 Day Theory was released.  This album was Tupac Shakur a.k.a. Makaveli's last great album, with the following releases just being what the public needs to keep interest.  The 7 Day Theory is a collection of deep, almost surreal songs chronicalizing what Tupac appeared to have recognized as his last days.  The digitally remastered version only has the music video for &quot;To Live and Die In L.A.&quot; as a difference from the original.  Songs like &quot;Bomb First&quot;, &quot;Hail Mary&quot;, and &quot;Hold Ya Head&quot; are blatant disses to his rivals, yet are lyrically exceptional and backed by more than good beats.  &quot;Toss It Up&quot; could be labeled as &quot;How Do U Want It Part II&quot; with its sexually charged lyrics and vocals from KC and JoJo (who also accompanied him on &quot;How Do U Want It&quot;.)  &quot;Krazy&quot; is personally my favorite track, it shows us the depth of Tupac's soul and gives us a peek at how fame his changed himself and his life.  He speaks of how the only thing to silence his soul is his drug because his life is krazy and out of his control.  The accompanying rapper, Bad Azz puts forth a decent effort and blesses us with a deep, intellectual rap about life.  The song is classic and is among one of Tupac's best.  The melodic beat is the perfect addition to the silky smooth lyrics.  &quot;White Man'z World&quot; gives us a view of Tupac's anger towards the opposite race and makes it quite clear that being a woman is damn near impossible, especially being a black woman.  &quot;Me and My Girlfriend&quot; is an interesting song about a special object in his life, one that has protected him and brought him safety.  Tupac valued his life and never felt safe, which makes the object of this song the appropriate object to label as his love.  Listen closely...A few times if you have to.  &quot;Hold Ya Head&quot; is an excellent song, and I love the beat.  The 7 Day Theory is a timeless classic, an album only comparable to &quot;All Eyez On Me&quot; and surpassed by none.
B00000JYGX|5.0|This musical totally rocks! Awesome music, awesome singers, awesome music! What else can one ask for? It even rivals my all-time favourite Phantom Of The Opera! Spectacular performances by Patrick Fiori, Bruno Pelletier, Garou, Hlne Sgara (my fav), Daniel Lavoie, Luck Mervil and Julie Zenatti (basically all the leads) and emotions are felt clearly through this live recording of an Intgrale performance. Best songs are all the featured duets and triplets (is there such a thing?) such as the awe-inspiring and most beautiful &quot;Belle&quot;, the pretty &quot;Ces Diamants-L&quot;, the heart-wrenching &quot;Les Oiseaux Qu'On Met En Cage&quot; and the attention-grasping trial scenes between Frollo and Esmerelda &quot;La Torture&quot; and &quot;Le Procs&quot;. This musical is also great visually and I would recommend that you also get the DVD to couple with this double live Cd. Then you might both see and hear this record-making musical touted as the most successful in french history. I am pretty sure that this can also appeal to non-speakers of French since the storyline is not too hard to follow and one can actually catch a gist of what is happening through the arresting music and voices! I lent this recording to my non-french-speaking cousin and he was simply blown away! He told me that at the end he cried buckets when Esmerelda died and then he asked me where he could get this double-cd recording. I was amazed ... truly music is universal. This recording is an essential addition to any musical theater aficionado and a superb introduction to the French musicals scene. I also recommend Romo et Juliette as another fabulous introduction to French musical theater. So what are you waiting for? This recording is simply a must-buy and while you're at it, grab the DVD live recording of the same performance! And you'll be enjoying it so much, you'll be pressing the rewind button a thousand times!
B00004ZAV3|1.0|The review by Gregg Holycross, November 28, 2000, is entirely correct.  I wouldn't have known why the music quality was so bad without his analysis but I knew it was bad.  I hope to get my money back when I return the cd.
B000002LIX|5.0|It's the LP/ CD/ cassette to get if you dig Jane's.<br />Many people would claim it as one of the best alt-albums of the 90s, and that's tough to dispute.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|This soundtrack is a wonderful collection from the movie Lord of the Rings.  The music is powerful and moving, making you relive the scenes of the movie as you listen.  The two tracks which feature Enya are so wonderfully composed and so very heartfelt.  You absolutely must have this!
B000002LEE|5.0|In comparison to \\"Ritual\\", this is a better rocker and has the ability to get you moving quicker.  For alt-rock comparisons, this is really an essential disc to your collection.<br />That's actually the real selling point for this release: listening to it explains a great deal about where alt-rock was and where it was headed.  You can put many other artists of the time alongside Jane's and get the context rather easily.<br />Highlights?  Easy: \\"Had a Dad\\", \\"Mountain Song\\", \\"Ted...\\", and my favorite is \\"Thank you, boys\\", because Perry Farrell is all about delivering the goods on this disc.
B00005QK3W|5.0|I'll concede that Paul McCartney certainly made some good music here &amp; there after the breakup of the Beatles in 1970 (&quot;Ram,&quot; &quot;Band On The Run,&quot; and hit singles like &quot;Live And Let Die&quot; and &quot;Silly Love Songs&quot; are obvious standouts), but admittedly, his songwriting HAD gotten a tad soft after his Fab Four days. The main theory for this is that after the Beatles parted ways, McCartney was in such a hugely blissful state with his devoted wife Linda and their family, lovey-dovey pop was pretty much all the man could write during this time. As McCartney's old friend John Lennon once said, genius is pain, and from 1970 to 1997, McCartney did not appear to be experiencing *any* kind of pain in his life (Lennon's murder in 1980 notwithstanding), and his sometimes-fluffy songwriting back then reflected that.That all changed in 1998, however, when McCartney, very sadly, lost his lovely Linda to breast cancer. Three years later, after getting through his grieving process---and enjoying a new romance with the new love in his life, fiancee Heather Mills---Paul McCartney has rediscovered his long-dormant songwriting genius once again, delivering &quot;Driving Rain,&quot; without question the best album McCartney has done in many, many years. With a tight four-piece band behind him, Paul totally sounds inspired on this set, delivering some truly outstanding material (his singing voice and musical chops are still in top-notch condition, too). He runs the gamut on this one: the lovely &quot;From A Lover To A Friend,&quot; the heavy, steady rock of &quot;She's Given Up Talking,&quot; the breezy pop of the title track &amp; &quot;Tiny Bubble,&quot; the excellent head-bobbing rocker &quot;About You,&quot; the heartfelt &quot;Heather&quot; (gee, who's that, I wonder?), the African-tinged &quot;Riding Into Jaipur,&quot; and the incredibly thunderous workout, &quot;Rinse The Raindrops&quot; (nevermind that the man is heading toward 60---he stillknows how to rock, as this track plainly shows). And if that weren't enough, &quot;Driving Rain&quot; concludes with a marvelous bonus track, McCartney's live rendition of &quot;Freedom,&quot; the excellent anthem he wrote that was inspired by the 9/11 tragedy.While it's sad to think that it took the death of his beloved wife to get Paul McCartney back on the right track musically, back on track he most certainly is, as evidenced by this great album. &quot;Driving Rain&quot; is an instant winner, the most inspired collection of tunes that McCartney has delivered in a long, long time. Welcome back, Paul. We knew you could do it. :-)
B00003CX5P|1.0|Let me just get it this straight: I'm a fan of Star Wars, but I'm not biased towards thing I'd generally rant and rave is good, I have a pretty good opinion on what I like.<BR>But this I do not like. Why? It treats the audience like idiots. It treats us like idiots with half-efforted and sub-par CGI effects. It treats us like idiots with a bad plot, characters, inane characters (except Maul, Kenobi, and Jinn) and writing, and with a child actor who can't act (so why is he called an actor?).<BR>The thing is, the CGI effects look fake enough, but Lloyd's acting is worst. The thing is, he acted as though he ENJOYED his life of slavery. They should have had Haley Joel Osment to show a more sad, scared, tormented kid like he did in &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; but the thing is OSMENT AUDITIONED FOR THE ROLE AS ANAKIN SKYWALER YET THEY STILL CHOSE LLOYD FOR THE ROLE!! The thing is, they used cuteness over talent when they where on audions, when it should be vice-versa. It was as though Jake Lloyd was throwing animal crackers at me boasting how cute he was.<BR>Ouch. What could possibly be worse?<BR>Wait for it...wait for it...JAR-JAR BINKS!!<BR>This poorly animated character is worst than the Ewoks from &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. It takes far more than bad Home Alone 3-ish (ig: electricution, etc.) slapstick in TPM to make me laugh, and I'm positive I'm not alone on that opinion. &quot;'I, YI'm Yar-Yar 'Inks!&quot; &quot;Hmph, How wude!!&quot;
B00005QDW1|4.0|Ok, I'll admit that maybe this album is not quite as strong as Return of Saturn in some ways, but lets face it, 'Return of Saturn' is the 'No Doubt' 'classic' which any album they release in future will be compared to. <BR>I was disappointed with the first track 'Hella Good', It is very 'pop' orientated and I was almost convinced that it was Kylie Minogue!! A simple bouncy and uninspiring piece of pre-teen pop, your baby sister or brother will probably like it though.  The next track 'Hey Baby is almost a cross between Britney and Madonna - alright to listen to, but once again it does get a bit boring with it's mainstream pop influence - but don't be disallusioned because from the next track onward this album goes from strength to strength.  In my opinion track 4, 'Making out' really brings out the 'sexiness' in Gwen Stefani's vocals, and although it's not the strongest one on the album, it's fairly fast paced and it kind of gives you a good happy feel. Track 5, 'Underneath it all' is a great bit of ska and once again, Gwen's haunting vocals are used to the full. This is certainly cool to listen to with a haunting melody and brilliant ska feel, I love it and could listen to it all day. Tracks 6, 'Detective' and 7, 'Don't let me down' are more typical upbeat No Doubt tracks, not frantic but full of energy and yet again, Gwen's sexy vocals are used to the full on both of them. 'Detective' is not the strongest on the album but No Doubt fans will like it and 'Don't let me down' is full of energy and vitality. The next track, 'Start the Fire' is undoubtedly one of my favourite's on the album.  A strong 'funk' bass foundation with underlying electronic riffs are complimented brilliantly by an attractive melody line, and yet again Gwen's vocals make 'Start the Fire' a track that sticks in your mind all day. Track 9 on the album, 'Running' is somewhat slower and more haunting, but this does not detract from it's strength.  If 'Running', with it's haunting melodies and amazingly sexy haunting vocals, doesn't grab you, in my opinion very little will. I adore this track amd absolutely melted listening to Gwen stefani's voice (will you marry me Gwen).  The next track on the album 'In my head' is a little unusual for No Doubt.  It certainly has a strange 'feel' and is hard to catagorise. The best I can do to describe it is to say that it is 'bouncy', almost commercial in fact, but non the less enjoyable and it does kind of get into your head.  I think the saving grace of the track is the underlying 'spooky' melody line and Gwens vocals yet again. Not a strong track but ok and it grows on you.  Most No Doubt fans will instantly be comfortable with track 11,'Platinum Blond Life'.  The intro kicks straight into a typical No Doubt rock based track, full of energy and drive. For some obscure reason Gwen's vocals and the atmosphere of this one reminded me very much of Marcella Detroit (Shakespears Sister), but that's not a criticism as it is an excellent track. Next comes 'Waiting Room' and is undoubtedly the weakest track on the album in my opinion. It has a very 1980's 'Janet Jackson feel and I honestly do not think that it suits No Doubt or Gwen Stefani's vocals.  No, I'm afraid I absolutely hate it.  On to the final track of the album, 'Rock Steady'.  What can I say, it has an amazing rock steady (slow ska) bass riff, totally brilliant haunting vocals from Gwen and a melody line that will almost certainly have you singing to it at the top of your voice by the time you have listened to it a few times.  Not only my absolute favourite track on the album but probably one of my favourite 'No Doubt' tracks.  I fell in love with Gwen Stefani (yet again) listening to 'Rock Steady'.<BR>Overall I feel that this album is not as strong as 'Return of Saturn' and there are certainly a couple of weak tracks here, but these are well compensated for by the rest of the album and five or six excellent tracks which make the album good value for the money.  Thelyrics are not exactly 'deep' and are a little too much in the 'love theme' mould for my liking, but then again Gwen Stefani could sing about onions and gravy for all I care with her sexy vocal style.  In my opinion if you are a No Doubt fan then go buy it and you will not regret it, and if you are not already a No Doubt fan then buy it anyway and I think you will be. An album well worth spending your hard earned pennies on .
B000056K04|2.0|Dave Matthews Band is probably my favorite thing to listen to.  I own pretty much every CD and bought &quot;Everyday&quot; because I needed some Dave to get me through the rest of high school.  However, instead of the original, creative, and .. lets face it, amazing work I expect of him, I got some boring pop. When confronted with Britney Spears and NSync I'd always just look to Dave to represent my generation.  However, he seems to have joined these synthetic CD sellers for some reason. To anyone who is just getting into DMB, I suggest Under the Table and Dreaming.  I wore my first CD out and had to get another one--it's great music.  Before These Crowded Streets, Remember Two Things, and Listener Supported are also good, but all of their CDs previous to Everday are worth listening to at every opportunity.  I'm being optimistc and hoping that DMB's creativity and pure magnifcence is just hibernating and not actually dead.  Hopefully he'll drop his new management, but it seems like that's improbable...  For recycled pop music, this CD is fine.  I might have even left &quot;The Space Between&quot; on the radio while driving if I didn't mourn the loss of a great band every time I heard it.  Instead of &quot;I Did It,&quot; I'm craving a song that gives me the feeling #41 does, or Ants Go Marching. Let's all ignore this CD and hope it goes away.
B00005IC2H|5.0|music touching to the soul.  spirit reverberating to spirit.  you can listen to this music for weeks and not notice you don't know the language.  while i sculpt and enter into the 'flow' of creativity, this music gives the abyss a memory of where we stand.  this music enhances the chill caught by the spine; if you haven't felt, you may not appreciate.  I personally have tired of all cd's when having heard them up to 10 times (except for maybe the 'pink and jimi)and this one has been played continuously for a month.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Coming from a broad history of musicals and stage acting, I went in expecting much from Moulin Rouge and came out with my expectations shattered and my views of music, movies and everything in between changed forever.  Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet impressed me but Moulin Rouge blew me away like no movie I have seen before or since.  It's scope, acting, music, and beauty (yes, beauty) is breathtaking.  By the way, Ewan MacGregor should be on broadway because his voice is absurdly good.  Nicole Kidman, while lacking the punch of Ewan MacGregor, is excellent as well.  This movie also has an incredible range of emotion displayed.  I laughed out loud one moment and cried like a baby the next.  It's the best movie I've seen all year, bar none.  Go buy it.  Now.

0385505833|5.0|I picked this book up on a whim while at Costco.  I read it quickly; in one day, I think.  I could relate to each and every feeling of the Kranks.  Wanting to stop the world and jump off even if it were for just 10 days.  I LOVE Christmas passionately but I work at keeping it fun, believable, nearly stress-free and family-centered.  It's so easy to want to experience everything and become almost inflexible about how holidays should be.  I was really hoping that the Kranks would get to experience their cruise.  However, when you have children, you will scale Mount Everest for them.  Life is precious and uncertain, especially these days.  This book I will keep and re-read during the holidays to remind me of the simple kindnesses of people that you don't always realize until you need help.
B00005N9CV|2.0|Will the real Diana Krall PLEASE WAKE UP. I have every CD that she has released and seen her live several times. She and her quartet have a hot tight sound. After waiting so long for a new release, this was indeed a disappointment!
0312117337|5.0|Some friends are marvelous tarot readers. I've always wanted to learn tarot. The Rider-Waite would never work for me, never felt right. Then I was loaned an OZ deck under strange circumstances during a time of transformation. This deck was a key. I've learned much about myself through using this deck.<br />The first striking feature of the deck is the beauty of the illustrations. Some are just striking and powerful, especially with the interpretations from the book.<br />I do energy healing, Reiki and shamaniam. I find the OZ deck helpful to my clients and to me in giving insights into personal problems and blockages. The OZ deck is about &quot;personal&quot; responsibility for your circumstances, not guilt or blame, but responsibility. It shows it isn't what is happening in your life, but how you react that is important. People may not be happy with the readings from the OZ, but no one denys the power and insight of them.<br />To use this deck effectively requires a lot of personal reflection.  This isn't a deck to be used or taken lightly and casually.  This is very serious and not for fun and entertainment. The biggest complaint I've gotten about the deck is, &quot;I hate this deck. It's far too revealing.&quot;<br />My only complaint is there is no provision for reversed cards. In my personal experience I've found that I can come up with reversed meanings for most of the cards though.
6302842174|4.0|Question:  What is better than listening to Kate Bush's The Whole Story?  Answer:  Watching the Whole Story-The Videos.  Kate Bush is as imaginative in her videos as she is in her songs.<br />&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;The Man With The Child In His Eyes&quot; are mere performance clips.  The former is the original vocal version from The Kick Inside, not the new vocal version on the Whole Story album.  The latter makes great effect of Kate's lovely face, framed between her leonine brown hair.  &quot;Wow&quot; has her singing over a mixture of concert footage taken from her Live At Hammersmith video.<br />&quot;Cloudbusting&quot; is a story video which has her the daughter of a scientist who has made a rainmaking machine.  I could be mistaken but it looks like Donald Sutherland playing her father.  Someone let me know.  I don't know if Kate is supposed to be playing a little girl, her mannerisms are akin to a seven to nine year old.  Memo to Kate:  you look better with long hair.<br />&quot;Breathing&quot; is probably the best and most bizarre video in the collection.  Kate, wrapped up in a mounds of transparent plastic, portrays an unborn baby, complete with umbilical cord, and sings the horrors of nuclear war.  The song takes on a more disturbing meaning, when she sings of breathing in her mother's nicotine, especially when the part of the song with the authoritative voice on the effects of an atomic explosion comes in.  Kate is shown violently thrown around her mother's womb.<br />&quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; features a ballet duo, Kate is the female, whose routines take on a wrestling and even sexual nature.  The bizarre imagery in that one is the shot of many people walking towards us, wearing xeroxed faces first of the male, then of Kate.<br />&quot;Army Dreamers&quot;, shot on video camera and in a studio setting, effectively captures the anti-war sentiment of the song.  Her closing eyes are in rhythm click-clack sound.  The two scenes of import are of Kate, who upon seeing a young boy in camouflage, drops her gun and rushes toward him, mother instinct in full throttle.  The second is of Kate, charging with a &quot;kowabunga&quot; expression of her face, only to be thrown backwards into the bushes by an exploding shell.<br />&quot;Experiment IV&quot; is a story of the song, with the deadly sound personified by a ghoul resembling the vengeful spirit in Raiders Of The Lost Ark, who ends up killing everyone in the top secret bunker.  There is a twist at the end.  Who is seen getting into a van, giving us a conspiratory wink?<br />&quot;The Big Sky&quot; shows her fun side, as a gathering of characters, including British pilots, Superman, and Soviet soldiers come together on the rooftop where she is stargazing and transform it into a stage.<br />Bush's videos and the ideas that spring from her head may not always be comprehensible but like characters in Fellini's movies, leave an undelible impression, and is leagues better than today's MTV fodder.t are of Kate, who upon seeing a young boy in camouflage, drops her gun and rushes toward him, mother instinct in full throttle.

0385505833|4.0|not having read much of mr grishams work before I didn't know what to expect.  I was thouroughly delighted by the characters and the theme for this story.  He took an odd situation, with lots of challenges, and brought it to an only conclusion that could happen.  Everyone should be so lucky!!!
B00005U2LM|5.0|Wu Tang Clans last album [the w] did not have a large commercial sale, in my opinion do to the lack of quality.  I was expecting another straight hip-hop album but from the first track [in the hood] I was straight amazed by the scratching and total digital style of Iron Flag.  RZA's influence as a producer on this album shows in the amount of vocals he does on the album, and the clean crisp digital sound Bobby Digital [RZA] is known for.  Overall this is a AMAZING album.  Many different sounds from track one through twelve.  An awesome dozen of digital hip-hop songs finely produced and engineered to a perfect new Wu Tang sound, proving without a doubt that Wu Tang is one of the illest groups.  The lack of O.D.B. [old dirty bastard] really doesn't effect the album, it still has a definite Wu Tang Clan sound. Overall a must have for any true Wu fan.
B000059HAI|5.0|If you were not entirely pleased with the recent \\"Pearl Harbor,\\" then \\"Tora Tora Tora\\" might be more your style. The title is taken from the code issued by the Japanese Air Task Force Commander when he saw while approaching Pearl Harbor that they had achieved complete surprise against the Americans.  It is a very good movie of epic proportions, featuring a large assembly of vintage aircraft, and the production filmed on location at Oahu. There's no love story, the operation itself and historic events leading to the attack are the main features.  Most interesting is the movie comprised of two productions, a collaboration between American and Japanese directors to achieve an accurate depiction of the event that brought America into World War II. The portrayal of Admiral Yamamoto's profound remark about awakening a \\"Sleeping Giant\\" at the end of the movie has a much higher impact than the more recent scene in \\"Pearl Harbor.\\"  Fans of naval history will enjoy this one. This version does not follow-up with Colonel Doolittle's raid on Tokyo, but you can try \\"30 Seconds Over Tokyo\\" with Spencer Tracy to see another depiction of that operation.
0684830515|3.0|I read this after reading Michael Palin's Hemingway Adventure. Unlike many others, I was not forced to read this in school. I later visited Pamplona during the San Fermin festival. The description of Pamplona is good if you remember that nearly 80 years have passed since it was written. According to Palin, this book by Hemingway is solely responsible for the international renown of the feria at Pamplona even though there are similar events in other Spanish towns. The story centers around an expatriate American writer living in Paris and his circle of friends. They travel to Pamplona to attend the festival. I found the novel to be dull. I was able to read it through but I don't consider it a particularly good book. Unlike people in the real world, the characters in The Sun Also Rises don't seem to have to work for a living. It does provide a good description of  bullfighting and fishing in Spain's Basque region. While the novel's protagonist spends two weeks in the Pamplona area, I was bored after one day. Hemingway fails to describe the drunken mobs (dressed in vomit-stained whites with a splash of red at neck and waist) roaming the streets, sleeping on benches and vomiting into gutters that I saw.
0385505833|3.0|This one gave me mixed feelings.  The beginning was great but the last part almost forced me to put it down.  I found myself completely agreeing with the absurdity of Christmas spending and decadent traditions.  There's a lot to relate to in the first part of the book.  The middle takes a disturbing twist with the subtle and overt coercion of the protagonists (the Kranks).  I wanted to tell the Krank's neighbors and friends to &quot;cram it with walnuts.&quot;  Unfortunately, the last part takes a frustrating turn into absurdity.  The marathon events during the last day are completely unbelievable.  The &quot;rescue&quot; and heartstring ending is a bit predictable but makes for a warm finish.<br />&quot;A Painted House&quot; was a refreshing and wonderful tale about simple life.  This story, however, is not nearly as compelling.  It's a decent quick read but is not on my recommended list.
1565113306|4.0|Great story (ten stars), as you probably already know. About 5 hours on four cassettes, each with its own case. No sound effects, just straight reading. Reader is J. Todd Adams from, ahem, 'Days of Our Lives'. He's not bad, but if you've already seen the film, Edward Norton's voiceovers are matchless.<br />The printed book is short, and there is quite a bit of repetition (albeit effective repetition). For these reasons, I think the story lends itself to the printed text version more than to audio.
0316776963|4.0|Enlightened people know that David Sedaris is quite possibly the funniest person on the planet. I bought this book at a book signing (and enlightened people also know that even better than reading Sedaris' work is hearing Sedaris read Sedaris' work -- so you might want to look for the audio). He read several excerpts and I was laughing so hard during &quot;Jesus Shaves&quot; I thought I'd have a heart attack and they'd have to cart me out of there. In dark times, books like this keep you alive.
0553212443|4.0|\\"You will be haunted by Three Spirits.&quot; So forewarns Jacob Marley's ghost to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge, a miser of stingy, unfavorable traits. And so begins the enduring Christmas classic distinguished by almost everyone. Come along on an erratic journey with the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future, all of whom attempt to point Scrooge onto a virtuous path. Meet the most notable characters ever introduced in literature: Bob Cratchit, angelic Tiny Tim, and good-natured Fred. With vivid descriptions of Victorian England and enlightening dialogue, 'A Christmas Carol' will enrapture both the young and old throughout the year with a vital lesson on hope and benevolence for humanity. This, I find, is treasured most of all in this brief story marvelously crafted by the creative Charles Dickens. No matter how many adaptations of the book one has seen on television or as films, the real source is highly recommended and should not be missed. For if you do pass the book up, you are being just a Scrooge (metamorphically speaking, of course!).
B00004Z459|5.0|I bought this CD about a month ago or so and haven't been able to put it down since. Unlike most other highly rated musical groups who only have a few good songs on their 13 or 14 track cds, every one of Linkin Park's songs are enjoyably enertaining. All of the tracks are very unique in different ways, but the band seems to sign all of their songs with an unmistakeable sound. Linkin Park takes so many different elements of music and mixes them all together so fluently that it's just fun to lie in bed and pick everything out. One thing can certainly be guaranteed- you will definately find at least one song you won't be able to get &quot;out of your head&quot;. If you're having any doubt about purchasing this CD, shake it off and buy!

B000003S5H|5.0|I bought this album on the strength of Sexy Boy and was absolutely astounded at the depth and variety it had to offer.As someone who mainly buys indie and alternative rock music I was surprised at the extent to which this album appealed to me.Every track has something new to offer and yet they flow together perfectly, taking one track away from the selection would break the balance. My favourite songs on the album have to be All I need and La Femme D'Argent, the former a dreamy, mellow beautiful track whilst the latter a jazzy, funky number.This is the sort of album I want people to know I own because it is that good. Everytime I play it I feel like I should be in some drinks lounge, 70's style, or alternatively on a sunny beach with the sun setting (a cliche true but this album produces a base reaction that defies thought). Since buying Moon Safari I have expanded my music tastes, so I have Air to thank for introducing me to music that doesn't just contain guitars.
B000002KBH|5.0|This was the one when they &quot;finally got it right&quot; in the studio.  Love every song on here. Love Grisman mandolin parts on Friend of the Devil and Ripple.
B00000K2W1|5.0|No &quot;best of&quot; album ever reflects the total output of the artist concerned. That being said, however, most genuine attempts to re-package an artist reflect the view that the compiler has of that artist. And this album is no exception.<br />This same general track listing has been released in several different countries under several different titles, for different labels. &quot;New&quot; Janis stuff should come through Columbia, who hold most- if not all- of her recorded material. Better still if it is authorised by the Joplin family.<br />This album is a general grab-bag of stuff from across Janis's recording career; from Big Brother, through Kozmic blues, to the posthumous &quot;Pearl&quot;. The emotinality, timbre, and at times raw and unadulterated power of Janis' awesome voice get good representation on this compilation.<br />It serves as a good primer for anyone wanting to pursue Janis as an artist, or female blues singers and female rock pioneers, in general. There is a decent body of material besides the three studio albums to search for.<br />If you want to read about Janis' life, the best biography is Alice Echols' &quot;Scars of Sweet Paradise&quot;.
B00004W510|5.0|While &quot;Big Pink&quot; was the album that changed Rock and Roll, this one went back to the roots of R&amp;R.  This one is more fun to listen to.  Its pure foot stompin sing along music at times, and sweet folky ballads at others.  If you were to buy one Band album, this would be my reccomendation.
B00003CXTG|1.0|If I could have rated this movie less than a single star, I would have.  As it is, I purposely avoided paying full price when this film was in theaters, and must have had some kind of mental breakdown to actually rent it.  There are so many different ways this movie is bad, I won't be able to list them all.  Here are a few examples: <br />1. On the bridge of a Japanese ship, the camera zooms in on a wall calendar and shows the day &quot;Sunday&quot;...in ENGLISH! <br />2. Army Air Force pilots were given physicals by the Navy.<br />3. Our brave heroes dogfight in the thin freezing air above the clouds wearing Hawaiian shirts and no oxygen masks.<br />4. These same pilots participated in the Doolittle raid.<br />I will admit that there were a few facts that were accurate (yes, Pearl Harbor is in Hawaii).  But for each of them there were dozens that were not only false, they were offenses to the intellegence of the audience and to the memories of the brave people who were actually there.  As an historical portrayal of WWII events, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is the motion picture equivalent of &quot;Hogan's Heroes&quot;, only that series had much better acting, writing, and directing than this pathetic waste of celluliod.<br />PLEASE, don't waste your money by buying or renting this DVD!  Instead, for the same type of experience, buy yourself a case of Hostess Ding-Dongs and stuff them down your throat until you vomit.<br />Seriousy, I can't stress enough how bad this movie is.  I am disgusted that younger generations will see this movie and believe it to be a true account of our nation's most tragic day of the 20th century.
B00004Z459|5.0|the only complaint about the cd is that i wish it was longer.  its that good.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|I think this cd is great! She has kind of a jazz style throughout the cd, which adds a little flavor. She has also added a very well done music video for the christmas song. All in all a very well done NOT overdone cd.
B00005U2LM|5.0|This CD Is a step in the right direction for the Wu, it sounds much like their first with a little modern twist to it.  All the songs and beats are top-notch, the songs that stand out are; &quot;Rules&quot; &quot;Uzi&quot; &quot;Ya'll Been Warned&quot; &quot;Iron Flag&quot; and &quot;Dashing.&quot;<BR>There are a few minor things I found to be wrong in the album, a few of the beats sound too awkward, the beats in &quot;Chrome Wheels&quot; and &quot;Soul Power&quot; sound like something out of Saturday Night Fever, but the lyrics are good so I didn't pay too much attention to it. All in all I would say that it is a must-buy for any rap fan.
B00005QZWI|5.0|The only classical music I ever seem to like is on soundtracks, and &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is no different.  The Celtic sounds of pipes in &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; to the ups and downs of &quot;The Knife in the Dark&quot;--this is possibly the greatest soundtrack I've ever heard.  My favorite is &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship.&quot;  Wait until the end and be treated with a sweet, sad voice and lyrics.  Enya's &quot;May It Be&quot; and other contributions fit nicely with the movie.  I am a huge fan of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and I was happy to see that this soundtrack lived up to my expectations and added perfectly to the movie.

0790736322|5.0|It is with trepidation that i watched this film, having heard so much about it. <br />I am glad that i did. This was an unbelieveable experience. It is truly a great film. The acting is first class, and the basic idea is extremely original, and quite disturbing. <br />But, i have some minor quibbles with it. I cannot know how anyone can say this is a scary movie. I watched it at 11 at night, and when it drew to a close my final thought was &quot;is that it?&quot; Honestly, i thought there was more to it. It ended quite abruptly, and seemed very short. Surely there's more? I thought to myself. And &quot;Is this what they've all been talking about?&quot; i thought, perplexed. Because it was simply not scary. I didn't flinch once, as i was expecting to. Call me a liar if you want, but you would be wrong. <br />I cannot understand the fuss about this film. It is disturbing, admittedly, but hardly scary. the scariest moment was when the mother (forget her name) goe sinto the loft with the candlestick. Apart from that, it wasn't frightening in the least. I really cannot believe how everyone claims this is the scariest film ever made. Even the demonic taking over of the young girl seems like just a natural progression, and i found myself thinking &quot;so, what's new?&quot;. <br />However, i suppose i am forgetting the time gap between my seeing it and its being released. In those intervening years we have been hardened much mroe against such material, by authors such as Thomas Harris, Stephen King, and al the other novelists who have turned gore and horror into the new &quot;in thing&quot;. Attitudes toward such material are now much more liberal. When this first came out, i suppose the like of it had never been seen before. But now, i do believe it has lost it's bite. <br />However, it is still an absolutely superb film in it's direction, topic, acting, and all other things. This will go down in history. Deservedly so.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Never have I been this excited about purchasing a DVD. I literally bolted home to watch all the 'bonus'on this DVD release and it sure was worth every penny. Not only do you get an amazing movie with out of this world audio transfer, especially if you have surround speakers, the extras in the DVD release is so much fun. You get The Making of, music videos, interviews with the stars, director, designers, extended scenes and so much more. I saw this movie twice in the movie theatres and am glad that I can finally take the experience home with me. This is not just a movie, watching Moulin Rouge was an experience I shall cherish and never forget.

0385505833|4.0|When Blair Krank leaves home for a year in Peru, her parents realize that Christmas just won't be the same this year. Luther Krank, a tax accountant, calculates that last year Christmas cost them $6,100 and decides that this year the Kranks should skip the Christmas festivities altogether and take a Caribbean cruise instead. With the cruise booked and word out that they won't be celebrating this year, the Krank's begin to prepare for their departure on 25 December but what they aren't prepared for is the reaction of their friends and neighbors who are determined that they won't skip Christmas that easily. But, when 'disaster' strikes the neighbors all pull together and show that they really are full of the Christmas spirit. This short novel is a quick and funny read. I recommend it to anyone whether you love Christmas or can think of nothing better than skipping Christmas yourself.  Also read &quot;Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Little Book of Wisdom&quot; by Taro Gold.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Even when some people try to save this insulting sequelae of SW, This film is an example of how easy is to fall in the temptation of using the past glory of a masterpiece as Star Wars to atempt to fool the educated espectator. This is not only not a fun movie, but a disgrace for the film industry itself. In spite of all those special effects, the overabuse of computer animation is worse that those seen in Jurassick Park (sequelae II and III), and the lack of inteligent and coherent plot is discouraging. It might be fun for people without filmic pretensions, but is so heartbreaking for us Star Wars lovers. Please Mr. Lucas, can you change the title of the next movies and separate them from the marterpieces we saw 20 years ago?, don't ruin our memories.<BR>Thanks
B00001OH7N|5.0|While Bowie showed signs of his talent briefly on Space Oddity, his first great album was Man Who Sold the World. This was my first Bowie album and since I've bought 25 more, but this is still among my favorite early Bowie. It brilliantly melds very eery, but creative music and metal with his dark, futuristic visions. This album could be considered metal, as the guitar playing of the fabulous Mick Ronson sounds very metal, but this album is so much more well thought out and written (yet raw and underproduced) than most metal albums. He shows no fear on this album (wearing a dress on the front) and singing about topics in ways that no one else could or would. Every track on this album is brilliant but some are out of place (Man Who Sold the World and Black Country Rock, but still fantastic tracks). This album is on the brink of anarchy and insanity, with insanely brilliant lyrics and music, plus the best singer and writer of alltime, was the genius behind, so you know it's good. If you like this album then go with some of his other metal albums, like Outside or with his glam rock classics Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane. Although the best ones are Station to Station, Scary Monster, the Berlin Albums, and Outside. THis album is bowie in a style that he never covers again and that is brilliantly done but only once. Enjoy the album and purchase some of Bowie's other brilliant albums.
B000001FY9|5.0|Everybody knows a couple of Bob marley songs, here they are, not his best album in my opinion, but truly the difinative benchmark for popular Regge music. A must have for any collection, or if you are just starting to build a solid foundation, this is the CD that rome was built upon
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|This movie was by far one of the funniest spoofs I've ever seen! I usually find movies of this type PAINFULLY predictable, but this one had loads of things that came out of nowhere! The only complaint I had was that it mostly spoofed Scream (KILLER movie!) and I Know What You Did Last Summer. There were a few quick references to other movies/tv/commercials we've all seen.. but not really enough. I went to see this expecting it to be dumb and a waste of money. But instead, I bought it as soon as it came to video and am going t get the DVD soon as well :)
B00003CWPR|1.0|I can't believe I wasted time watching this movie.  I kept watching it in hopes that a plot would unfold and unfortunately one never did!  A huge waste of time.
B00003CX95|5.0|Ok, most men will love this movie.  Yes, its got a love story blah blah blah, but it has BATTLE, and WAR, and KILLING!!! WOHOO.<br />Ok, seriously, this movie is one of my all time favorites.  If your weak of stomach it may not be the movie for you (or you can close your eyes during the bad parts).  There is a lot of war, and they do not hold back the struggles and difficulties of battle within this movie.  You feel terrible for those that have to run in on the battle lines and hope to survive the fight.<br />However you also get a rich storyline with struggle, love, and deception.  All the characters are full of life, detail, and history.  There are comic acts to help break the tension as well.  All bundled into a short 3 hour movie called Braveheart.  It is a movie you will not soon forget.
B00003CXXI|5.0|SHREK is one of the best movies of 2001. Granted it's a CGI film. However, before the holiday season, there weren't many movies to arrive in theatres in 2001 that were so entertaining for both children and adults.  Like The Simpsons, The Muppets, Veggie Tales, and the TOY STORY films, SHREK contains a lot of obvious humor that kids seem to enjoy (especially the fart jokes), but also tons of jokes that most children won't get, but that adults will chuckle at.The basic plot of the movie is this. Shrek is an ogre who lives alone in his swamp and is quite happy there until one day he saves a talking donkey from a group of guards. Donkey befriends Shrek and before the ogre knows it, his swamp becomes a safehaven to all sorts of fairy tale creatures who have been displaced from their homes by the Napoleon-complexed Lord Farquaad. Shrek and Donkey set forth to meet Farquaad and end up going on a quest to save the beautiful Princess Fiona (who happens to have a beauty secret).SHREK is a modern-day fairy tale told using computer animation. It doesn't deconstruct fairy tales as some have suggested. However, it does rip on Disney big time. That specific satirical cartooning is one of SHREK's biggest treats. And even if you don't pick up on or enjoy the Mouse House bashing, there are plenty of flatulence references to make you laugh.
B00005TO7C|4.0|Britney's Third album shines in it's import form. Containing two extra traacks that were foolishly deleted from the US release of the Album. 'Before The Goodbye'  and \\"When I found you' are some of the stronger songs on the album.<BR>I'M A SLAVE 4 U- Bumps & Grinds its way onto the radio everywhere for her break out single, it was a wise choice because this album is intended to bring britney to an Older fan base.<BR>OVERPROTECTED- reminds us that britney has not yet left her pop roots and will be released as the second single in Europe. In the song it seems as though her writers have echoed what she has said in many interviews, \\"But who am I to say what a girl is to do, God I need some answers!\\"<BR>LONELY- again helps to not push the album too far away from what fans come to expect from Britney. Empowered, angry and in the mood for revenge this song borders britney on cursing \\"I won't take your 'huuuuuh!' no more.\\"<BR>I'M NOT A GIRL, NOT YET A WOMAN- The Second Single in the US is the only real Ballad on the US album, A low key ballad co-written by DIDO the song seems to fit spears' voice better then past ballads.<BR>BOYS- The second song on the album produced by the Neptunes (who produced Slave 4 U, has a similar sound as slave, but breaks into a missmatched ballady part towards the end.<BR>ANTICIPATING- One of the Best songs on the CD, just fun, makes you want to go out and dance.<BR>I LOVE ROCK 'N' ROLL- Pretty much a straight cover of the Joan Jett hit, could have left this one on the Crossroads Soundtrack, would have helped sold the soundtrack, and seems missplaced on the CD.<BR>CINDERELLA- A great song that tears a little from some great madonna hits, the spoken word seems to bite too clearly from Madonna's \\"rescue me\\"<BR>LET ME BE- Still back to basics pop, with a strong beat.<BR>BOMBASTIC LOVE- The Song has a great beat, (Used in the opening of the Overprotected Video) However Lyricly it is just well (...).<BR>\\"Bombastic love, so fantastic. Where I'm completely yours and you are mine!\\"<BR>THAT'S WERE YOU TAKE ME- Fun and bopy! Nothing special.<BR>WHEN I FOUND YOU (BONUS)- What can I say a great Ballad that just should be on the US release!<BR>BEFORE THE GOODBYE (BONUS)- The BT produced song that is missing from the US, though not as good as 'I Run Away' (the other missing song only on the asian release) BTG definately is differnt for Britney and would have insured a new fanbase.<BR>WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME- with Justin Timberlake on back up vocals this song really should just have been on an N'SYNC CD... ew Justin!<BR>  In the end this version may be better then the US (the US is WAY too short. However, the Asian version had I Run Away instead of Before the Goodbye and well it is just a great song. Her Best Ballad by far. \\"Lets pretend that I've Moved on, then I'll tell myself that life goes on without you...\\" So if you have the choice I would put your money on that one. However I wish there would be a version with all three missing songs, that would rock!
B00005JG6R|5.0|For many, like myself, Akira was the film that got them fascinated and often infatuated with Japanese animation. Katsuhiro Otomo created a masterpiece with this film and the much longer manga that accompanied it.<br />The action in this story does not let up. The motorcyle scenes are just so well conceived -- they're breathtaking. You also begin to relate to the characters of Kanaeda (the cool popular leader type) and Tetsuro (the quieter runt member of the teenage gang).<br />The deeper meanings of human evolution and the huge metaphor for Japan's resurrection after WWII are not to be missed. But there are some small side-plots going on in this film. You can watch it numerous times, and get a little more from it. A must buy for anyone who considers themselves an anime fan!
B00005JKES|1.0|i have always been a HUGE fan of Lynch's work and couldn't wait for Twin Peaks to be released on DVD but on getting the box set, what do I find?  The 90-minute pilot is MISSING so unless you've already seen the series previously or have no sense of continuity, then a huge chunk of the plot, the fun, the atmosphere is missing.<br />sure, a summary is included with the box set, but why not save yourself ($$$) and just find an online review of the whole series and read that instead?  Artisan seem to think that a summary is enough for how it all began, so why bother yourself by watching the rest of it?<br />Wouldn't have been soooooooo upset if the packaging had at least give some clue to the absence but no, it quite clearly states THE FIRST SEASON.<br />the technical quality of the set, however, is great - the commentaries and additional features are brilliant, but i would happily have swapped them for the FIRST EPISODE.
B00005QATY|5.0|I'm not going to try and be profound.  Simply, this movie was an unexpected delight.  I had no idea what the plot was - didn't even read the box.  The story is based on Homer's Odyssey set in the 1930's, but that's really irrelevant.  Clooney was great and I applaud him for taking a role so unlike anything he's done before or will ever do again.  Wonderful supporting cast - why don't we see Holly Hunter in more things?  Sit back, pour a glass of wine, and do something really different tonight.  Watch this film.
B00003CXTG|5.0|You guys, this movie (Pearl Harbor) is NOT, repeat, NOT that bad!!  I really don't see the need for all the criticism.  After reading some of these reviews, you would think it was the WORST movie made in history!!  Trust me, it's NOT that bad.  Sure, it has it's romance, and it DOES have a love story, but it's basically like any other love story mixed with disaster. It's not JUST a love story though.<br />Some say that this movie was all computerized.  Oh, like &quot;STAR WARS: Phantom Menace&quot;  wasn't??  That whole movie was basically made on a green/blue screen.  Plus, the only thing computerized in PH were some of the attack explosions (like the arial bomb) and some of the zeros.  They used a couple of the authentic zeros that they could find, but some of them couldn't get airborne since they were like 60+ years old.  BUt most of the dynamite and explosions were REAL.  Those were real people falling off the ship (Arizona).  Unlike in the movie &quot;TItanic&quot;.<br />Besides, I think that a lot of people only see this movie as a LOVE story.  Did anyone forget to mention how graphic and heart-wrenching that hospital scene was??  It really made my stomach turn.  Imagine, some people ACTUALLY went through all that torture!!  Seeing all those dead bodies and people getting blown up in mid air (those were REAL people in the movie by the way) really shocked me.  I can't imagine how I would react today if I saw planes shooting down bullets right at my feet.<br />SO, bottom-line, this movie DOES have a LOT of romance in it (so what?)  but I think MOST people are missing the point, and are not seeing the WHOLE movie.  It's NOT just a love story. YOU get a sense as though you're actually in the 1940's (which is hard to do).  You have to actually put yourself in the character's shoes.  And I think that Micheal Bay did a pretty good job of conveying this.<br />Definitely WORTH renting/if not buying!!!  :-)
B00005R87Q|5.0|This movie is great if you like cars and girls.  There are alot of people that think bigger is better.  Well there just wrong.  The people that think mustangs are good don't understand this movie. Everyone needs this in there dvd collection.
B00005RFVL|5.0|what can i say, robbie williams does it again, what a great cd a great recopilation of the greatest songs of 50s and 60s with his great voice. BUY IT NOW.
B000003TA2|5.0|I'm a huge Sonic Youth fan, I own every LP they've released and if I had to choose a favorite I'd pick this fine gem.  It doesn't have my favorite SY song, that being Star Power found on EVOL, but every single track on this album could be considered a classic. The opener Dirty Boots is kind of laid back  and has expected excellent guitar work.  The next song is my 2nd favorite SY song, that being  Tunic (Song For Karen), it's powerful, Kim is at her best.  I love the lyrics to it.  The next 2 songs are great too, Kool Thing a rather unique collaboration with Chuck D of The Public Enemy.  The next song is my 3rd favorite SY song, Mote.  The main part being pure musical exstacy.  The lyrics and Lee's vocals are great.<br />The rest of the album follows the greatness the first 5 songs have, My Friend Goo...being kinda strange and the album closes perfectly.<br />Very recommended, a classic of the 90's.
B000002BPS|5.0|this 1997 album by the offspring is simply brilliant.I bought the<BR> album yesterday and I was hooked to it.it has a variety of songs<BR>ranging from punk,hard rock to ska.so if u r a punk fan or a hard<BR>rock fan this is the album for u.
B00003CXTG|4.0|First of all, Pearl Harbor is a good movie.  I thought it was a tribute to the &quot;Greatest Generation.&quot;  The Pearl Harbor battle scene is the best war scene ever.  It bests the Saving Private Ryan D-Day by a wide margin, also when the R-rated version comes out next fall, it will leave no doubt as to the absolutely astounding quality of the battle scenes.  The love triangle is a tad overwrought, but so what, it is adequate, just like Titanic was adequate.  The atmosphere created by the filmmakers greatly overshadows the inadequacies of the plot.  You could spend all day pointing out little historical discrepencies in every war film, Saving Private Ryan involved a mission that never happened, I won't name others.  Basically, Pearl Harbor was a movie that got canned by critics who love their films pretentious and self-serving aka Waking Life or Memento.  Anyway, it's entertaining and it does justice to the Pearl Harbor attack, not much else can be said.
0780625129|5.0|Everyone told me that i would love this movie, and after giving in and watching it, i almost kicked myself in the head for not watching it sooner. I wouldnt classify myself as racist, because everyone is equal, but what Derek ( Edward Norton) said in that movie, well to be honest some of it made so much sense. This movie is about skinheads, and the major skin head who brutally kills two black men for trying to &quot;jack&quot; his car. What this man goes through is enough to make anyone loose their marbles, especially the ending. Just when you think that everything is going to be ok, you want to cry. Great movie, i recommend you give it to all the rebellious teenagers out there who just don't care anymore.
B00005RFVL|5.0|After watching Robbie's knockout treatment of &quot;Have You Met Miss Jones&quot;? on &quot;Parkinson&quot; a few weeks ago, I had to buy this CD...a fantastic effort from track 1 to 15.  <br />The opening &quot;I Will Talk and Hollywood Will Listen&quot; (while a good number) does not exactly fit into the scheme of things here, but it is &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; that really sets the tone for the rest of the album (I only wish Bobby Darin were around to hear Robbie's swinging take on this classic, as well as &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;). I must have played &quot;Mack&quot; several times, and each time it knocked me out!!! <br />The other tracks are fine, including his duets with Jon Lovitz (&quot;Well Did You Evah&quot;), Rupert Everett (&quot;They Can't Take That Away from Me&quot;), Jane Horrocks (&quot;Things&quot;), Francis Albert Sinatra (loved the vocal on &quot;It Was a Very Good Year&quot; incorporated into Sinatra's original recording with Gordon Jenkins), Jonathan Wilkes (&quot;Me and My Shadow&quot;), and Nicole Kidman (&quot;Somethin' Stupid&quot;). Thank you Robbie for doing justice to &quot;Mr. Bojangles!&quot; <br />Robbie's a recent discovery of mine (thanks to BBC America), and I have to thank young artists like him for helping keep alive the tradition on singing these great American standards. He has the support of excellent arrangements (Steve Sidwell), and knockout backing by some of Hollywood's greatest jazz musicians, many of whom backed Sinatra on record, etc. Thank God that much of this album was recorded at Frank's old stomping ground (Capitol), and engineered brilliantly by Al Schmitt.   <br />He may be no Sinatra, Darin, Martin, etc., but I hope Robbie makes another album of this type in the near future...can't wait to get my hands on the video/DVD of his Royal Albert Hall concert.
B00005NTNU|5.0|A dvd collection to watch over and over. It's been proven that noone will match Clint as &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;. The other cop heroes will use his style and humor, but they fall short in the &quot;originality&quot; category. Buy it..watch it!!
B000002L99|4.0|I don't sense this album as having a new singer, (Sammy Hagar), as much as I sense it as being a further development upon the melodic heights which the band reached on 1984.  &quot;Dreams&quot;, and &quot;Love Walks In&quot;, are among the best 5 songs of the Van Hagar era.  Along with &quot;Summer Nights&quot; they make this album well worthwhile.  It has a very fresh sound.<br /><br />Hagar is about 10 years older than Eddie, so here VH began to write from a deeper and more adult perspective than was typical even during 1984.  Ed looks noticeably older as evidenced by the band photo, as though his alcoholism had finnaly caught up with him at the age of 31.  But regardless, the band sounds anything but stagnant as was clearer on OU812 and Balance.  This is certainly an inspired effort.<br />&quot;Good Enough&quot; says welcome to the new VH.  Listened to from a lighthearted, fun 80's perspective, the song is enjoyable.  &quot;Why Can't This Be Love&quot;, is an upbeat, if somewhat cheesy synth based tune.  &quot;Get Up&quot; finds Sammy strutting in the vein of his father who was a pro boxer.  It's very motivational in both a cerebral and physical way, if tiresome due to the near constant double bass pedal drum beat.  On &quot;Dreams&quot;, Sammy finds himself within his new band, hiting the high notes with greater ease than Roth could.  A great use of keyboards by Ed.  The first guitar solo is interesting, and the second solo punctuates the lyric: &quot;And in the end on dreams we will depend/Cause that's what love is made of&quot;.  &quot;Summer Nights&quot; is the best rocker of the album.  Ed's Steinberger has a searing growl.  The riff right before the chorus is very cool.  This is a typical VH girl chasing song, but with less sleaze than Roth would give.  Check out the breakdown: Anthony's slow rock groove makes the perfect foundation for Ed to wail over.  Then just before another verse comes in, Ed shreds the song to pieces with his inhuman pic slides up anddown the fretboard.  It's a classic feel good party song.  &quot;Best Of Both Worlds&quot; is a respectable rocker.  Credit Sammy with good lyrics here:  &quot;You don't have to die to go to heaven/Or hang around to be born again/Just tune into what this place has got to offer/Cause we may never be here again.&quot;<br />&quot;Love Walks In&quot;, is undeniably the jewel of the album; Very atmospheric.  The opening is so beautiful.  Sammy's melodies and singing are elegant throughout.  The guitar solo is like a fairy tale.  Ed has never played with more passion.  With keyboards in the backround, the song absolutely melts you.  The unusual &quot;5150&quot;, is a progressive song which works quite well, although is not neccessarily radio friendly.  &quot;Inside&quot; is Sammy's turn to ham it up as the band makes fun of itself.<br />As a power ballad, &quot;Love Walks In&quot;, is even better than OU812's &quot;When It Love&quot;.  Here Van Halen finds itself securely nestled in the forefront of 80's pop.  It was a very special time, and this album had a certain purity that will never be duplicated again.
B00005R87Q|5.0|Quite surprisingly I found this to be one of the most entertaining movies of the year.  While it is certainly not an oscar worthy movie, it is simply a movie that entertains.  The action is amazing and seeing a movie about the world of import racing was something I've been waiting for and this movie didn't disappoint.  The only problem is the misrepresentation of the true import racers.  While it is true that people of various nationalities do participate in this import scene, the majority of the people are Asians.  And I found it sad that they could only fit Asians in as the bad guys or as background people.  Come to my town of West Covina and I guarantee you that every five minutes you will find an Asian driver, male or female, behind a customized, dropped import car.  Still, I found myself enjoying this movie tremendously and the DVD has some amazing features.  If you have a home theater system, the sound is awesome.  Definitely a must buy for you action fans.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Quite simply, it's Private Ryan takes the Titanic to Armegeddon.  Special effects cheesy, all the airplanes were out of trim.  Melodramatic to the max.  Even my wife thought it a bore.
0385505833|1.0|NOTE: If there was a minus one star I would have chosen that.<br />It seems you will either love or hate this little \\"story.\\" I just wanted to LIKE it, but alas, its insipid story and two-dimensional characters kept reminding me of an episode of some moronic TV sit-com. I cannot believe an author of Grisham's talent and storytelling ability would come up with a piece of tripe like this. It has all the earmarks of a bunch of publishing suits wanting to create a \\"Christmas Classic\\". Who is this book aimed at? Obviously people who drive Lexuses, who live in some kind of mind-controlled neighborhood, who are wealthy with more money than they know what to do with, who spend upwards of six to ten thousand dollars a year on Christmas folderol, and whose personal values are thoroughly selfish and self-serving. Sorry, John, I don't relate to that world. I don't relate to the valueless Christmas or even the kind of sketches you call characters. There is absolutely no self-reflection or self-enlightenment that comes through the &quot;events&quot; this story tries to tell. This is not a satire, nor is it a parable of modern values, nor is it even a good read - it is a clear example of a good first or second draft of something that may have potential if you got rid of the characters, the story, the dialog and the idea. Even the ending (a feeble attempt to be Frank Capra-like) is contrived and maudlin. Skip this book... save your money. Better yet, find a good charity and donate the money you would have spent on this waste of paper and ink.
0553212737|1.0|There is one principle reason that Emma is remembered.  It was written by a woman.  If Jane Austen had been a man, her works would be regarded as banal and inconsequential works of little literary merit.  The work is impressive considering that Austen came from a culture that repressed women (a characteristic that most female authors share), but beyond that it is a poor work.<br />There is a profusion of works of greater literary merit by women than what Austen offers, Mary Shelly's &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, Kate Chopin's &quot;The Awakening&quot;, Alice Walker's &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, &quot;Nectar in a Seive&quot; by Kamala Markandaya, or a very fine piece &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; by Zora Neale Hurston.  All of these works have better characteristics than &quot;Emma&quot;, and prove to be superior to all of Austen's writings.<br />Trust me, &quot;Emma&quot; is a waste.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I will admit that I am not that big of a pop fan and I wasn't a Britney fan either. But this cd has converted me majorly! I heard it in a friends car and I fell absoulutely in love with it! I bought the next day. This is music that teenagers actually can relate to and all of it is extremely catchy. I am sorry but I can stand it when people say that her music has no emotional depth at all. COME ON! She is only 20 years old! She hasn't even experienced life yet. What do you expect? Her to be singing about drug abuse, depression, or suicide like most rock singers. And if you don't think I Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman or Let Me Be aren't personal, what is? <BR>Anway this is an awesome cd that everyone should have! It is fun, catchy, and positive. Britney should be proud of herself!
B00005RFAI|5.0|i heard the song &quot;Get this party started&quot; at a skool dance and i loved the song!! when i got the CD, i was amazed! she is definately comin out! this is so much better than her other CD. i luv the song &quot;get the party started&quot; and &quot;dear diary&quot;. Pink has the best music ever, cuz who wants another stupid pop girl singer like britney?!!?
B00005QXXO|4.0|I just purchased the new Radiohead live album, and let me tell you what this album kicks ass!   There are only a few groups that I would even consider buying live albums from, Rush and Radiohead are probably the only two.  I did not even know this album was coming out, I just happened to see it listed on Amazon.  The track listings are as follows:<br />The National Anthem<BR>I might be wrong<BR>Morning bell<BR> Like spinning plates<BR>Idioteque<BR>Everything in its right place<BR>Dollars and cents<BR>True love waits<br />The majority of the album is from Kid A and Amnesiac.  My favorites included: The National Anthem, Morning Bell, Idioteque, Everything in its right place and True love waits. The majority of my favorite songs are off Kid A. I especially like True love waits; I have never heard that song until I bought this album, the acoustical song is a great ending to the album. The only drawback that I can see from this album is that they don't put anything on from before Kid A.  There are a TON of good songs from OK Computer and The Bends that they could have added to this album but did not.  A single Live album does not do this group justice a double album would have been awesome!  But all in all this was the best ($$$)I ever spent, do yourself a favor and go get this album!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The movie itself is definatly the most incredible movie I have ever seen. It has everything that a movie goer would want from it. The DVD comes packed with so many great features. Deleted Scenes, extended dance sequences, music videos make for an incredible DVD experience to go along with the incredible movie experience.
B000002MNR|5.0|I'll never forget the day, in 1977, when I first heard \\"sultans of swing\\" from Dire Straits.  I was totally fascinated with the guitar licks.  In my opinion, Mark is the best in the business.<br />I've watched him grow over the years, and he's only gotten better.  Anyone who loves this work must own \\"Golden Heart\\".  You may no longer hear Mark's music on \\"Popular stations\\". That's because these days, it's about the MTV thing.  Look is more important than talent.  But hey, Mark was the first to tell you that with \\"Money for Nothing\\".  Enrich your life.  Purchase this CD, or the individual CDs.  Either way, you're going to love it.
B000001IPL|5.0|From one of the, at least I think, the best bands ever comes one of the greatest cd's of all time. The music and lyrics of this cd can get anyone to enjoy it. The raw emotion that Dexter Holland shows in songs like What happened to you and Gotta get away make this one of the best. Songs like Come out and play and Genocide have great music by guitarist Noodles. The cd also has the song Self Esteem, which is te best song ever, or at least i think so. Take the advice of a person you don't know. Buy this cd.
B000000OAL|5.0|You might take a bit of time to get to appreciate the genius of this but this is certainly a masterpiece and I love it . My favourites are upbeat rocker  'Keep Yourself Alive' , the beautiful  'Doing Alright 'the brilliant  'Liar' the sad and imaginative  'My Fairy King and Roger Taylor's 'Modern Times Rock 'N Roll -classic 1970's  hard rock  at its best.  We would see more examples of by Taylor in subsequent albums  ..These are all masterpieces which should have got much greater recognition than they did .<br />There are also numbers with some rather nasty  verses such as 'Great King Rat and 'Mad The Swine ' which we would see toned down in the later albums ,  and 'Son and Daughter' is rather strange . Jesus sounds like Queen's tribute to Gospel music and is actually quite memorable with it's melodic choral chant. Nevertheless  all of them are important in studying the development of the band.<br />It definitely worth getting.Listen a few times and you'll love it .Its one of the best rock albums of all time.
6305428352|5.0|Hey, Forget It, sorry to put it so bluntly but you missed it.  <br />Richard Dreyfus's character is so great because he's not perfect.  He never wanted to be a teacher.  It's a story about how someone can not realize how their life really was important and valuable until it's all laid out in front of them. <br />If Dreyfus's character was a nice guy when the dissapointments of his life happened, then the whole movie would not have made sense.<br />Dreyfus's performance is incredibly realistic and his reactions are completely human.  It's really one of his best roles, but I think maybe you need to have lived a little bit and experienced the dissapointments as well as the joy that life deals you to appreciate the movie. <br />Recommend this movie highly!!
B00005ATQH|5.0|If you are a big fan of lolita subject movies, then this DVD is a MUST HAVE!!!So far I have found THREE &quot;5 Star&quot; lolita-subject movies at amazon. My #1 favorite &quot;Lolita (1997)&quot;, a very close second #2 &quot;Beau-Pere&quot;, and a distant third place #3, this DVD, &quot;Lolita (1962). I must confess, that if it was not for the rarity of this subject matter on DVD, I would give this DVD about FOUR (4) STARS, due to its lack of EROTIC STEAM. But being thankfull to have a third lolita-subject movie in my collection, I will give it FIVE (5) STARS.NUDITY: Their was absolutely NO NUDITY in this movie. In &quot;Beau-Pere&quot;, there were plenty of topless scenes, a scene of her nude butt walking to the shower, and even some scenes of her laying on top of the guy half naked and doing it!STEAMY SCENES: Their was also no scenes in this movie of a steamy erotic nature. The scenes did not go above the level of a &quot;playfull coy flirt&quot;. In the 1997 remake of &quot;Lolita&quot;, their was plenty of hot steamy scenes. The girl did not have to be half naked to generate erotic steam. The sexy poses, mannerisms, touching, rubbing, kissing, face expressions were VERY HOT!!!STORY and PLOT: What gives this movie its 4 or 5 star rating and it's advantage over the other two movies mentioned is its clever and ingenious plot. This movie had the better story line and character development. The story ended just like a very clever detective story.ROMANCE: However, their was plenty of sweet romance. If their was no romance between the girl and guy---no matter how great the story---this movie would get a THREE STAR rating and would not even count as a lolita-subject movie and would be a total waste.QUESTION: Why do so many reviewers give the story line and even much detail about the movie, taking up much space, when the person reading the review already knows what the movie is about? Or if he does not, he can go to many other places to find out what the movie is about. REVIEWS are intended, and SHOULD stick to discussing the pro's and con's of the movie and a measurement of how good the movie is. Each movie review should be a UNIQUE REPORT, and not a re-telling and re-telling of the story and plot.SUMMARY: If you like movies about an older guy and a teenage girl who share a relationship, then this movie is FOR YOU! BUY IT TODAY! This movie is full of sweet and cute romance scenes. Their is also the rage and jealousy stuff. The chemistry and acting of the characters are OUTSTANDING!ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005176F|5.0|blur: the best of, is a brilliant compilation of the band's songs so far. The cd includes almost all of the favoured songs of Blur, and is NOT compiled in a chronological order (which is good, and managed very successfully). There is &quot;to the end&quot; which features the wonderful voice of Laetitia Sadier (of stereolab) and &quot;no distance left to run&quot;, beautiful Blur tracks. A must buy, an essential both for those who own other Blur records, and for those who want to know what the band is about. The cd art is neat and clean, well done and the portraits of band members by Julian Opie are wonderful. Overall this set is a beautiful thing to own. <br />What is expected and needed now is a compilation of Blur videos for these tracks, which (mostly) are also innovative and beautiful pieces of work.
B00003CXXS|3.0|I read reviews about this movie, and nobody seemed to really hate it, so I bought it.  I'm not disappointed.  I've watched it 3 times, plus (thanks to DVD) skipped all the BS and watched the spinosaurus and T-rex throw down a few more times.  Yes, the story is pretty lame even the first time you see it.  It follows the standard Jurassic Park &quot;teach-you-a-lesson&quot; format.  In this one, we once again learn that we shouldn't be messing with prehistoric animals.  The dinosaurs look pretty good, especially the raptors which seem much more real than in the past.  I just wish they'd quit holding back this series' potential because some kids might see it.  Man, let's get some people on this island for a legitimate reason, not because some hang-gliding punk has been missing for two months.  That's stupid.  And who goes to the rescue?  Mom and Dad.  Catch my drift?  Dumb.  Make this thing rated-R, put a lot more swearing in, and give a Jaws vibe to it.  Remember how scared people were to go in the ocean when the first Jaws came out.  I want to be scared to walk through the woods.
B0000029AL|5.0|This album is incredibly underrated and should be bought by ANY rock fan. A great start is Make It, which has a great beat. The next song, Somebody, really gets you moving. Dream On, one of Aerosmith's greatest contribution, is next. One Way Street is next, and it gets into seven minutes, but it's  well worth listening to. Mama Kin is just amazing. The second best song on the album, it's first minute and two seconds is an awesome guitar solo, and the rest is just creative lyrics and ear catching tunes. Write Me a Letter is kinda bluesy, with cool lyrics. Movin' Out, the next song, starts slow and quiet, but ends fast and loud. The last song, Walkin' the Dog, is just rockin' out like the rest of the album. A last word: buy this album.
B00004T9UF|5.0|After I saw the commercals and saw the videos on mtv I picked this album up.Ever since then it's been at the top of my collection leaving his old cd in the dust.If your a rap fan I highly recomend it to you. But if your under 17 or whatever the hell the limit is, don't bother listening to it.It sends a lot of bad messages.It sends a lot of bad messages. beat up by some fool...<br />I'm white, and I try to act black, but then I say that I'm white, and then make fun of whites and act black, while trying to appear white, talking like I'm black, while throwin' out the racist terms.... YO!<br />I like my mother, but then call her a ho, just so my father doesn't get jelous &quot;Don't worry dad, get ready yo&quot;... Backing that ass up, because I act like I hate gays, because I'm in denial... YO!<br />I tell you that doing is drugs is cool, just because I can't afford any and hope you'll send me some soon.  Hey look, I made a complete sentence... recognize!<br />!@@#@$#@ the @#@#@# @#@#@#@ yo... be @$#@#@ my #$#$#$@#@ #@$#$ son.. you @#$#@$# better recognize!....... YO!<br />The Marshal Mathers LP is a masterpiece of music.  It has such beautiful lyrics, insightful overtones, and it's fun for the whole family.  Buy it for your kids... cuddle around the campfire, and enjoy a night of family bonding... word to my pseudo-homies!e &quot; I'm Back&quot;, &quot;Who Knew&quot;, &quot;Criminal&quot;, &quot;Stan&quot; and many others.  I suggest you purchase this album yourself and make your own assessment of it.  Peace out, Jonathan, or rather his alter ego Slim, discusses.  It is there for shock value; and give the guy credit: he certainly knows  how to shock people out of their mindless complacency and intellectual  slavery to stupid ideological abstractions.   My major problem is that this  album (as well as most rap music) is geared toward kids as a target  audience. Children should NOT be exposed to material like this. My kids  certainly won't be listening to it. But maturelisteners who have had their  fill of liberal propaganda should get a kick out of this highly  &quot;insensitive&quot; material.
B00003CXXI|5.0|The animation is superb,the story well-written and the songs are unforgettable.You'll crack up at the little jokes in the movie,and there's a good lesson to learn:Don't judge others by the way they look.This movie is a wonderful film that will continue to entertain young and old alike!
B00005NWM3|4.0|Face it, music today really is crap.  Nickelback certainly isn't breaking ground, but they are talented and they put on one great live show, meaning they are better than most bands today.  Whether that means anything ... who knows.  But if you can see them live, run and do it.<br />Anyway, this disc is solid, but if you liked it ... go get The State.  It's much better.
B000002C1V|4.0|Anyone who is a true Floyd fan will not be find this to be at all lacking. It is incredible, the emotion, the lyrics, the music, it's all there. It's almost a conclusion to the wall. It is a tribute to hero's and innocence lost. Gunners Dream and Fletcher Memorial Home are incredible. Wish they were here....
B00005OAIE|5.0|I bought this CD because I loved the song &quot;No Such Thing&quot; and now that song has become my third favorite on the CD.  I have listened to it over and over!  &quot;Neon&quot; and &quot;St. Patrick's Day&quot; are my favorites.  It is so hard to belive that this guy is so young!  I saw him in concert (where he opened for Stevie Nicks!) in San Francisco.  I was totally floored with his confidence and talent.  This is a &quot;feel-good&quot; CD and I just love it!
B000002JS8|5.0|This is Bon Scott era ac/dc at its finest. Starting off with the classic song Highway to Hell and with other great tracks such as Walk all over you, the brilliant touch too much and shot down in flames just to name a few, this is Bon's peak in my opinion and his final studio album with the band.<BR>The album has a touch of a commercial feel without losing the trademark rawness of the band. I highly recommend it for any AC/DC fan.
B000020617|4.0|This is my first Foo Fighters album. I bought it because I loved &quot;Learning to Fly,&quot; but aside from that track there are a number of other great tunes on this disc. &quot;Breakout&quot; is an unforgettable ride that sends shivers up and down my spine. &quot;Stacked Actors&quot;, &quot;Generator&quot;, and &quot;Live-In Skin&quot; are also compelling, driven rockers. &quot;Next Year&quot; and &quot;M.I.A.&quot; are mellower but equally engaging. The remaining tracks on the album tend to drag and don't do as much for me. If all the songs were as good as the ones I cited, I would give this disc a five-star rating. Instead the four stars represent a solid album that's worth the purchase for some really good tunes.
B00005OM4N|1.0|This album is full out cheesy cornyness!  All of the songs start to sound the same after a while, the only two songs that I think are even slightly promising are Cinderella and What It's Like to be Me, but after a while I'd get sick of them too!  This album sounds so different from her other two albums but it hasn't changed for the better!  Take a listen to the samples and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about!  This is deffinitely one of those albums where you must listen before you buy it!  See for yourself!  Happy hunting!
B00003CXZ4|3.0|While this movie is not a classic, it certainly was worth watching twice. The first time is very interesting, and the second time allows the viewer to make their own interpretation about what is REALLY happening.
1891252089|3.0|Well, if you're one of these 'power' yoga people and want a book with all the correct Hindi terms, descriptions and pictures, this is it.  A large, oversize book that will likely daunt a beginner, and serve as perpetual reference for the would-be yoga teacher who finds personal satisfaction in likewise daunting beginners.<br />It is WAY more than the average person wants (or needs) to know about yoga and, sadly, like so much of pop-yoga these days, seemed to emphasize the physical form over the spiritual and meditation limbs of Ashtanga yoga.  (In case you didn't know, the purpose of the physical postures and vinyasas are to strengthen the body so it can sustain the intensity of pranayama and meditation practices, which in turn lead to higher states of consciousness and eventually true liberation.)  <br />Instructors like David Swenson seem to regard yoga as a masochistic obstacle course where the goal is to be a kind of contortionist extrordinaire.  While he lists all eight limbs and touches on some spiritual aspects, the vast majority of the material focuses obsessively on the physical form and thus fails to correctly provide the true purpose of yoga.  Swenson apparently hasn't yet realized he is much more than his physical body and that the aim of yoga is nothing less than the union of the limited Self with the Infinite.<br />If you're studying to be an Ashtanga yoga teacher in the Pattabhi Jois tradition, this is the ultimate reference to all the essential asanas, vinyasas, bandhas and their accompanying Hindi names.  If you're out to impress people with how many Ashtanga postures you can do, you'll want this on your coffee table.<br />For the rest though, it's likely more than you ever wanted to know about the physical side of Ashtanga yoga.
6304140711|5.0|After channel surfing for about 15 minutes I noticed Reese Witherspoon on the television. After seeing her hilarious role in Legally Blonde, I decided to see what this movie was all about. Then I noticed the incredibly gorgeous Mark Wahlberg, and decided to watch it. From start to finish I was on the edge of my couch wondering what would happen next (cursing when a commercial would come on). <BR>    I thought this movie was very well put together. The characters were very well thought up. Reese Witherspoon played a lovestruck teen Nicole Walker, who fell in love with David McCall (Mark Wahlberg). Nicole's family is then stalked and terrorized by David and his friends after she breaks up with him. <BR>  This movie was an edge-of your seat thriller and you will love it!
B00000K19E|5.0|This is the coolest movie i have ever witnessed! Getting this on VHS is not good enough as the movie itself is too much for a pathetic VCR to handle.<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />okay, basically if the whole fake reality is real them we are living in a computer generated dream world designed to keep us under control to turn a human body into a battery for the use of AI(artificial intellegence) machines. A scary thought yes but with the help of some renegade humans who escaped from the matrix, the \\"agents\\" are gonna be put on a run.<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />I would explain more but as no-one can be told what the matrix is, you'll just have to get it for yourself untill the truth is clear to you.
B000005ITX|2.0|I really love music of the 1960's and early 1970's. Not just the<BR>usual top 10 stuff that is grossly over played on the radio, but bands that have been unfortunatly forgotten by time.While searching to see if someone has released Clear Lights'debut album or Elephants Memorys' &quot;Eat,Sleep,Enjoy&quot; album I stummbled upon Loves' &quot;Forever Changes.&quot; Looking for a new band to get into I bought the Love album but was sorely disappointed.<br />I just didn't hear what was sooo great about this album. I agree with the other reviewer who stated that the lyrics are pretensious. I've heard this album being compaired to &quot;Pet Sounds,&quot; my question is HOW?? The musical arrangements weren't anything special at all.<br />Wanna hear something different? It's A Beautiful Day,Strawberry AlarmClock, The BeachBoys' &quot;Smiley Smile,&quot; Vandyke Parks'&quot;Song Cycle,&quot; The PeanutButter Conspiracy, Vanilla Fudge, The Move, Harry Nilsson. However,if you just have to hear it, proceed. You might really like it. I respect that others do enjoy this album.
B00003CX9S|3.0|It was nice to see such a beautiful and elegant movie like 'The Elephant Man' released on DVD. Even with the slim pickings of extras (trailer and make-up docu) that could be forgiven, just as long as Lynch fans and fans of good cinema had this movie in pristine DVD format. Well, it's here, but it's a long, long ride. For reasons I don't understand, Lynch decided to release this without chapter stops (a similar thing happened with his awesome 'The Straight Story'.) This is such a disappointment. I have never even heard of a DVD without scene selections, and it really hurts the disc. No skipping to favourite scenes, no taking the disc out midway through watching. Definately a mistake for this fine film release.
B00003CXTG|5.0|First of all let me tell you that i am a guy, and since i saw the trailers, i was telling to myself, a movie about the attack on Pearl Harbor?&quot;, by Jerry Bruckheimer and Micheal Bay?, this going to be good&quot;, i truly don't see why do people where expecting a masterpiece, i mean we were about to see a movie by the guys who brought us Armageddon, but Pearl  Harbor is better than Armageddon, the acting was very good, specially by Josh Harnett, Kate Beckinsale, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Jon Voight, and the script was good, the love story was not as bad, as i was expecting, but it beats Titanic, the film is truly dramatic, and i almost cried, i am preety sure, it's because of what happened on September 11th, which in my opinion Pearl Harbor is another movie to push patriotism,in my opinion it was an excellent,with a few but non importants flaws,too bad that people keep misunderstanding Micheal  Bay and J.B.
B00005OWEG|5.0|Apocalypse Now. Where do I start? First of all. anyone who has seen any of Francis Ford Coppola's films knows that they are almost always great. But, besides The Godfather Trilogy, this is most certainly Coppola's masterpiece.<br /> This film stars Martin Sheen as Willard, a soldier in the Vietnam War. Marlon Brando plays Kurtz, who was on his way to having a huge military career, but for unknown reasons, created a following of people up the Mekong River that poses a threat to the U.S. military. Willard is informed of the situation, and is given the mission to find Kurtz and &quot;terminate&quot; his position there. Willard is told that he shall kill Kurtz on a charge of murder. As he makes the journey to find Kurtz, Willard encounters <BR>a chopper pilot who loves to surf(Robert Duvall), among other things.<br /> The pacing of this film is perfect. At the beginning, everything seems like a military mission. But as time progresses and you see the horrors of the Vitnam War, this no longer seems like a mission. It is now a mythical journey in which the hero must destroy a former hero who has now proclaimed himself king. Also, when the mission begins, the dangers are man vs. man, but later on, it becomes man vs. nature. When you finally meet Kurtz, Marlon Brando pulls off the performance with absolute perfection.<BR>He has gone crazy, but he is still a very calm man. Realizing that man is just a plaything of nature, plus having to endure the Vietnam War, Kurtz has established himself as a god, doing as he wishes with all the surrounding people. Some join him, others fear his reign. Kurtz thinks he has outdone nature. And maybe he has.<br />All in all, this is the best movie about the Vietnam War ever. It is also about how the need to survive can drive a sane man to insanity, even if what he has seen makes him question whether or not he wishes to survive.
B000001GQ1|5.0|When I first heard these sonatas I felt a little disappointed; however, after repeated listening I have been completely drawn into Kempff's vision of Beethoven, and won over. Kempff has an incredible grace and lightness of touch, so that his playing seems to float over Beethoven's developing dramas, seeing everything and holding it all in perfect proportion. His renditions of the Pathetique and Moonlight sonatas are exquisite, justly famous, and perfectly suited to his approach to Beethoven. I really enjoy Kovacevich and Brendel here, but with Kempff it is incredible how he seems to make every note count, and the clarity of his understanding is just mindblowing. It is his performances of the epic middle period masterpieces--the Waldstein and the Appassionata--that seem to invite controversy.<br />The Waldstein has never been among my favorite sonatas, since it seems to me to be quite devoid of emotion--more a showpiece for Beethoven's utter mastery of classical form than anything else--and this often shows in many interpretations of it. Too often what you get is a cold expostion of techinical mastery and apprehension of structure, and I think Pollini and Gilels are a case in point here. However, with Kempff the entire sonata is a rich flow of uninterrupted bliss. There's an aura of sublime inevitability about the entire performance, so that the conclusion is a dramatic rather than technical triumph. For me, there's nothing better than being allowed a new insight into a piece I thought I knew so well, but that's where Kempff's greatness lies.<br />As for the Appassionata, it took me a while to came around to Kempff's interpretation. It's a gliding rather than slow, measured take, and at first I thought Kempff simply lacked the power and grand scale in his playing to bring the Appassionata off. Arrau is for me the touchstone here, since he is so in tune with the Appassionata's epic-heroic qualities. Again though, Kempff has his own vision, and it's completely valid and compelling. While the first movement is still a bit quick for my liking, the slow movement just sings, and the finale captures the sonata's overall unease without becoming overwrought. <br />It's difficult to decribe the overall, cumulative effect Kempff's Beethoven has, but you have to experience it. There's no reason why one can't like Arrau and Gilels on the one hand, and Kempff on the other. This set is a perfect introduction to Kempff's Beethoven, and I'm looking forward to buying the re-release of his recordings of the last five Beethoven sonatas to set alongside those I have of Pollini, Arrau, and Gilels. Just remember, it's impossible to have too much of Beethoven, or for that matter too many interpretations of his piano sonatas.
B000002VCU|2.0|It's amazing how emotionally attached people get to the first songs they heard that turned them on to a style of music. Since it is the first time they heard that style of music, they automatically elevate the music to classic status. They cannot go back and revisit the song and listen to it with a critical ear. If you say something negative about the music it is as if you are attacking that person.<br />For many people, this was the first album to introduce them to Alan Parsons or progressive rock. So in many peoples minds it must be a classic. But, it you listen to it without the unemotional attachment, you find it isn't one of Parsons best. <br />I followed Parsons from the beginning. For us old time Parsons fans, this was a major disappointment when it was released. But, it was geared for a wider audience and introduced Parsons to a whole new legion of fans.<br />This is a silly concept album about gambling. Parsons has made some very good concept albums where his electronic, spacy style of progressive music works well with the theme (as in I Robot or Eye in the Sky). A rock album about gambling would be tough to pull off, and Parsons doesn't quite make it. It wouldn't matter how dumb or pretentious the concept is, as long as the songs are good. There just aren't very many good songs on this album. Even the best stuff doesn't equal the standards on Parons other albums. The song writing is weak and the music is bland. There is some really poor guitar playing. The last half of the CD (The Turn of a Friendly Card suite) is just a complete waste. <br />The concept album was one of things that destroyed progressive/art rock, along with over indulgence and nonsensical lyrics. There were many great concept albums (Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, Jefferson Starship's Blows Against the Empire and Willie Nelson's Redheaded Stranger), but there were also really bad ones (Yes's Tales of Topigraphical Oceans and almost anything by Rick Wakeman). <br />Alan Parsons is theconcept album king. He got his start as a studio engineer, working on such albums as Abbey Road and Dark Side of the Moon. He got the concept album bug and \\"formed\\" the Alan Parsons Project. The Alan Parsons Project is not a real group, but a studio excercise. This has allowed Parsons to expand the music beyond the confines of a structured group, but has produced some uneven results.<br />Parsons started with Tales of Mystery and Imagination, putting the words of Edgar Alan Poe to music. It was a pretentious concept but it worked fairly well. He then made the fantastic I Robot, where his style of music and the Isaac Asimov story blended perfectly. After that, he went on a slide, bottoming out with this album. He rebounded nicely with Eye in the Sky.  He still pops up now and again.  Most recently, he was in an \\"all-star\\" tour that played Beatles tunes.
B000002H97|1.0|this is one of the worst most overrated piece of (...) I have ever heard. metallica was once good and then I play this and it is poison to my ears. Listen to Megadeth, Halford, Black Sabbath, and Ozzy they are way better.
B000002J0B|5.0|This is the first Led Zeppelin I actually bought (a friend had lent me III prior to me purchasing this disc), and though it wasn't my &quot;introduction to LZ&quot;, I think that if you're going to start a Led Zeppelin collection or are curious about their music, pick up Houses of the Holy first.  <br />This album has those great rockers we all love like The Song remains the same, Dancing days and the closer The Ocean which are great for rocking out to.  It has a seven minute epic entitles: The Rain Song,which has beatiful guitar work.  When listening to it (the rain song that is) you get the feeling that the band were jamming out on a hill somewhere in the country and it began to rain a little, I mean this song captures this very outdoor type mood.  This album has a sort funk song,(the Crunge) which starts out with Bonzo and JPJ grooving along, are those trumpets I hear in the background?  No the lyrics aren't dumb!  What LZ album would be complete without a reggae song?!  Yeah, that's right a reggae song!  Only a great outfit like LZ could be this diverse and get away it, I mean they pull it off really well.  <br />While it's hard to pick a favorite from the bunch, mine would have to be No Quarter.  I heard the Tool cover of this song first, so I was curious to how this one would sound.  I feel the original is a much more mystical song than the Tool cover.  It's best to hear this one in the dark, especially during a snow storm, for the music and lyrics sake, trust me it makes the song that more powerful.  The keyboards fit in perfectly, the orchestrtion is superb, the band really put some effort into this one, though it flows so smootly and doesn't sound strained at all.  <br />Well like I said this a diverse album, with something to please everyone, it even opened me up to some new types of music.  Like many reviewers have said: &quot;it's a summer time album&quot;, boy did they hit the mark.
0385505833|3.0|I will keep this short and simple:<br />A fun, quick read but save your money and check it out from the library.
B000000OAH|3.0|Jazz was relesed in 1978, na d contains some of Queens more well known numbers, like &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot; and &quot;Bicycle Race&quot; as well as some great songs that usually get overlooked, like &quot;Dreamers Ball&quot;, &quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot;,and &quot;Don't Stop Me Now&quot;. But it has a lot of diverse styles and directions going on, and it doesn't switch between them in a subtle manner, it just dives right into them. A gentle ballad follwed by a pop masterpiece, a hard edge, fast moving rocker, followed by a love song, a sad song full of melencholy to an inspriational rock tune....if it sounds too jumpy, its because it is. As a whole, it has great moments, but isn't smooth, but if you have a shuffle button on your CD player, its problems can be fixed.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I haven't been very interested in No Doubt since &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;. The release of &quot;Don't Speak&quot; as a single ruined the band for me for several years. What once was my favorite song off the band's seminal album, radio and MTV/VH1 played the song too death. I haven't heard &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; but I do like what I heard. Gwen's outside contributions to songs by Moby and Eve were either horrible (&quot;Southside&quot;) or impressive (&quot;Let Me Blow Yer  Mind&quot;).<br />When I first heard &quot;Hey Baby&quot; when it came out before the album release, I was not particularly digging the song but it was one of the band's more interesting songs ever. &quot;Hey Baby&quot; has a Jamaican dancehall vibe to the song fused with electronic beats. Over time I grew to love &quot;Hey Baby&quot;. The song is as catchy as &quot;Just a Girl&quot; after a few listens to it. So intrigued by what I heard from &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, I decided I needed to check out &quot;Rock Steady&quot;. I am so glad that I picked up &quot;Rock Steady&quot;. This is a fun party album. I particularly loved the fusing of ska and reggae with techno beats. &quot;Hella Good&quot; is one of the best songs on the entire album. Famed producer Nellee Hooper (Bjork, Madonna) lends his talents to the song and creates a whole new sound for No Doubt. William Orbit contributes to &quot;Rock Steady&quot; with the charming &quot;Making Out&quot;. &quot;Rock Steady&quot; takes No Doubt back to their earlier days when they first came out. All the songs on this album is catchy and fun to listen to. &quot;Rock Steady&quot; has renewed my interest in the band. Definitely one of this year's top best album.
B00005K9LK|5.0|Very good all around album and great re-master Prisinor of you Eyes is the best . I also love electric eye, and you've got another thing comin'.
B00005MNP7|5.0|You bet it is. All the things that they did best are represented here: punk, power pop, girl group, and disco. Deborah Harry is in top voice, inventing her soon to be trademark wail of &quot;whoa wo, wo wo, wowa ha&quot;. There is not a weak cut on this Cd. Eat to the Beat opens with Dreaming, a sonic assault of drums and chiming electric guitars and is followed by the equally ferocious double entendre laden The Hardest Part. The wall of sound Union City is followed by my favorite track Shayla, where Blondie does something no other band of this era did, Sci-Fi rock. Shayla, who worked in a factory, is abducted by aliens while driving down the highway. The song is a sonic blast of drama and mystery. Die Young Stay Pretty was their first try at calypso and Atomic was the disco follow up to Heart of Glass. The Cd closes with I'm Not Living in the Real World which pretty much sums it up after this intelligent and always fun collection of songs. Blondie will never top this CD for it's sheer adrenalin and originality.
B000002TPS|5.0|I dont want to exaggerate. this is one of the albums (after so many years) that I still enjoy taking out and listen to it. a perfect 10. The energy, the melody, the lyrics everything is perfect. i wish Megadeth carried out this style but unfortunatly they have become a lot more commercialized. If you dont have this album get it.......Its worth every penny.
B00005QG9J|4.0|It is nearly a great album, but when your up against Tool nobody even really comes close, so yes this album is incredibly good, for all you mainstream heads out there skip Weathered and cop this it is much more worth it you won't get bored with the mundane arrangements from Creed.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This movie presents a funny and silly tale of an ogre (Mike Myers), a donkey (Eddie Murphy) and a princess (Cameron Diaz). Shrek is your average mean, grumpy ogre who lives in a swamp who just wants to be left alone. He then runs across Donkey, who is an amazingly annoying talking donkey who keeps you rolling on the floor laughing with his jokes. And then the two go off on a quest (complicated reasons why) to rescue the lovely Princess Fiona, who somehow isn't very wooed when she realizes her rescuer is nothing but a rather ugly ogre (sorry Shrek) and his noble steed is but a donkey. But the Princess and Shrek become great friends, and it becomes harder and harder for Fiona to keep her deep dark secret a secret much longer...<BR>This movie is absloluetly hilarious! For all ages, really. There are jokes that only adults (and teens) would understand, and some rather nasty hidden tibits within the dialog. My only dislike about this movie was how many stabs it took at Disney. Disney has brought us great movies, and although it was fun to watch them to poke fun at it, it got tiring after the eightieth joke. But it was funny and all around one of the better ones!
0140186409|5.0|This book is undoubtedly one of the greatest books ever written. It is Steinbeck's classic, which is really saying something. I've read some bad reviews here (though one spelled the name of the family wrong), but I just don't know how anyone can give this book 1 star.<br />The Grapes of Wrath is the essential story of that time period, as it perfectly sums up the Dust Bowl and the Depression era American. Out of this setting, Steinbeck creates vivid characters that you will not soon forget.<br />This book is not, however, uplifting. Yes it is pessimistic, but he is trying to make a point. And it can also be dry at times, though when you finish it I believe you will have found it well worth the read.
6302763835|5.0|Steve is actually an abbreviation of Stephanie.  Hee hee!  I just had to throw that in.  As far as the movie goes I have to admit that it is one of my pleasures!  I was close to three when I saw it at the show in 1957.  The part that stuck with me all through the years was the night scene in which the tarantula creeps down a hillside toward horrified horses (I felt so sorry for them!), and when it's eye fills the window of a two-story building!  The tarantula is a very well-made film considering the budget that was alloted for it.  Directors of 50s science fiction films often recieved major budget cuts to their films when studio heads wanted to save money!  For instance, &quot;Them&quot; 1954, would have been filmed in color but a huge budget cut only alloted for black and white shooting.  Also, directors were given a certain amount of time to get their film completed, so working conditions were often hectic and frantic!<br />Nevertheless, I think that this is a great sci-fi film and seeing it as a wee tot in 1957 allows me to view it with that special child like sense of wonder...and yes I still worry about the horses!
B00005B36H|5.0|This will be looked on upon in twenty years as a great album, a piece of work that defies definition from a band that does the same. The lame critiques of today will be soon forgotten and people will realize what a flooring experience this work is nuff said just pick it up it is the deepest thing to come out in a long time!
B00005QATY|4.0|What a wonderful surprise O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU is.  I had little interest in seeing the film--the marketing was bland, to say the least--but am now completely obsessed with it.<br />There are a few awkward moments in the film, including virtually all of the Pretty Boy Floyd stuff, but the performances of Clooney, turturro and Nelson more than make up for those small problems.  Clooney, in particular, is wonderful from start to finish.
B000000OMB|3.0|Though I like &quot;Alpha&quot; and &quot;Astra&quot; better than this album, Asia's self-titled debut is full of good quality songs that burst with emotion and intensity. Asia's unique, rich harmonies send chills right through you, and their drumming and guitar work never cease to amaze. They are truely a talented group, and they present this on &quot;Asia.&quot; My favorite song is &quot;Only Time Will Tell.&quot; Others I like are, &quot;Heat Of The Moment,&quot; &quot;Here Comes The Feeling,&quot; and &quot;Sole Survivor.&quot; <BR>&quot;Heat Of The Moment&quot; : Asia's big hit. The charging guitar chords at the start of this song are simply awesome to say the least. Then the song starts to build up and the drums are added. This gets you all set and ready to rock! Asia's harmonies are superb! This is pure rock!<BR>&quot;Only Time Will Tell&quot; : My very favorite song on the &quot;Asia&quot; album. This is more of a peppy song that really gets you moving. Like &quot;Heat Of The Moment,&quot; it is melodic and intense, with a great start and build-up. I love the soaring and rich vocals, and the melodic guitar in the background of the song. <BR>&quot;Sole Survivor&quot; : Somewhat thunderous with truely intense harmonies, this song is a wonderful part of the album. It does not really have the awesome start and build-up that &quot;Heat Of The Moment&quot; and &quot;Only Time Will Tell&quot; have, but it is still a great song. Whenever I hear this song, I can feel the emotion presented. Sometimes it seems that this song actually vibrates throughout my system.<BR>&quot;One Step Closer&quot; : My least favorite song on the album. It does not have the overall vocal/instrumental/muscial variety that &quot;Heat Of The Moment,&quot; &quot;Only Time Will Tell,&quot; and &quot;Sole Survivor&quot; have. This song does not have that &quot;intense&quot; feeling to it, either. It is a decent song, I guess, but definitely not one of Asia's best in my opinion.<BR>&quot;Time Again&quot; : Yet another example of Asia's unique intensity. this is not one of my favorite songs, but it is a lot better than &quot;One Step Closer&quot; in my opinion. The drum and guitar work are hard-rockin', somewhat hasty and kind of rough. Asia gets right to the point and tells it like it is. Again, the harmonies are so unique! <BR>&quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; : This song kind of has the same quality that &quot;Time Again&quot; has. I must mention the drums roll and pound through your eardrums. It is quite a dose of ear-candy. The vocals are rich, harmonious, and they soar. The intensity is there too, of course!<BR>&quot;Without You&quot; : I like this song a lot. This is a very emotional song that tugs at your heart strings. I like the style of the song in that the lead vocalist sings the lyrics by himself, and then the rest of the band chimes in to sing a beautifully crafted and intense chorus on the: &quot;WITHOUT YOU&quot; part of the song. This song sends chills through you! It is a song from the heart, in which I can relate to a lot.<BR>&quot;Cutting It Fine&quot; : Another good song overall. Again, Asia's trademark intensity is presented, and the drumming and guitar work are wild and superb. The vocals are intense and soar like with the other songs.<BR>&quot;Here Comes The Feeling&quot; : This is a peppy song that is kind of like &quot;Only Time Will Tell.&quot; I like the piano work at the start of the song. It goes wonderfully with the vocals. Asia's harmonies blend so nicely to give the song an up-beat, deep, rich flavor as with many of the songs on this album. This song is one of my favorites on the album.<BR>This is a great debut for a great band! Don't pass this one up! It is a musical joy-ride!
B00003CXTF|5.0|This was one of the best movies i have ever seen. Many people said that it wasn't historically accurate... but when you have guys as hot as Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett in it... WHO CARES? WHO REALLY CARES? The love story is absolutely wonderful, these guys are every girl's dream. Pearl Harbor will probably make you cry, but it's totally worth it. The &quot;war action&quot; in my boyfriend's opinion wasn't all that great, but if you want to see it for it's romantic value... you're in the right spot. Trust me! It's worth the rent or purchase!!!
B00005RFAI|5.0|My mom thinks it's a crack up that I like PiNK, but hate pink. All I can say is this albums from the heart. It's an awesome work of art from the queen who knows how to play her part. No more singing other people's words. She's in there with everything she's got, and it's a lot. Listen to it, it's good stuff.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Generally speaking, if I say a soundtrack is better than the movie, I mean the movie wasn't any good.  OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU is a wonderful movie, but the soundtrack is better.<br />Alison Krauss sings like an angel, the Whites show off the kind of full-throated tones that make traditional American music so attractive, and the Soggy Mountain Boys version of &quot;Man Of Constant Sorrow&quot; rocks and rolls in a way only the greatest Bluegrass can.<br />Buy it.  I've had it for a week and have listened to nothing else.
0064407667|5.0|What a dreadful and depressing story.  Bravo, Mr. Snicket!
B00005U2LM|5.0|This is definately wu's best joint since 36 chambers, as soon as you hear Rza's intro over that creepy loop you just know the wu are back. Then it kicks into a great opener called 'in the hood', which masta killa really shines on. The best track on there has to be 'rules' which captures the modern wu tang stlye and sound perfectly. other tracks that stand out are 'y'all been warned' and 'the w'. There is one track called 'one of these days' which i feel does'nt really belong on the album basically because it sounds too ordinary. But on the whole all clan members sound as good as ever and i would say that masta killa is just getting better and better with outstanding lyrics and wordplay. <BR>A GREAT HIP HOP ALBUM
B00003CXZ4|5.0|With a whole world filled with remakes and clichs it feels great to come across a movie such as Momento. The righter cut no corners in making this movie and it shows. Momento was about a man who's been seeking revenge for his wife's murderer but he has one problem, he cannot create any new memories since her murder because of a head injury that he suffered during the attack. The move is made backwards which creates some confusion throughout the movie but it all comes together in the end (or beginning). The camera work, the directing and the script all work in complete harmony to create a movie of superb quality. I don't believe that I have ever seen a really good suspense movie till now and I strongly urge anyone and everyone to rent or buy this movie as soon as they can.
630588255X|5.0|I first watched this movie on VHS in 9th grade.  I adored it immediately.  The depth of the characters is astonishing.  I am not normally caught up in such feel-good, tear-jerking movies, but this is The Exception.  <br />I watched the movie again in 1990, the night my 80-year-old grandmother died.  I had spent most of the day moping and crying and feeling the overwhelming sadness of losing one of my best friends.  This movie jump-started my healing process.  I was instantly able to look back on my grandmother's life with joy, not with tears.  I recommend that it be bought, not rented, as it is a great movie to have on hand when mundane, daily irritations start to &quot;get to&quot; you.  Maude's gentle explanations of the Cycle of Life, while simple, are beautifully communicated.  We have the options, every day, to view life like pre-Maude Bud Cort, or like Maude herself.  I know which I prefer.  <br />Beautiful, magical, heart-breaking...just a lovely movie.
0380788624|4.0|Before I begin, I must divulge a key bit of information that may bias my review:<br />It took me an entire year to read this epic.<br />The novel, which spans 900+ pages, 50+ years and no less than 4 protagonists, is at times, a clumsy effort to convey various key facets of modern technology, and a disjointed effort to convey fictitious events in World War Two.<br />At every other time, it is an absolutely brilliant work of art.<br />The first 300 pages of the book lagged for me.  It was hard to adjust to the constant shifting between protagonists, time periods, and ideas.  Randy's story was uninteresting, murky, and just downright painful to read at times, in comparison the bright and exciting adventures of the characters in World War II.  As a result of this story lag, I put the book down for 8 months, as I had just lost all interest in it.  The book greatly picks up the pace a little over a third of the way through, and becomes incredibly hard to put down.  <br />The characters' stories interrelate constantly; creating situations that will leave the reader amazed at the correlation between each character and how closely their lives, and the lives of their closest acquaintances tie together.  Stephenson does not so much illustrate some key plot points as much as he alludes to them; and this is my only major fault with the book.  Some key moments are left to the imagination of the reader, which is forgivable, for each of the character's stories could be expanded into its own 900+ page novel.<br />It's hard to get past the idea that Cryptonomicon is written for the techie crowd.  But whether or not you fully understand the underlying scientific and technological aspects of the story is not important; Stephenson intends the reader to walk away with a clear picture of what the consequences of their usage is.  Even disregarding the Math and Computer Science aspect, the story is full of humor and emotion that will leave a lasting impression on any reader.<br />It's a shame about the length.  At one point, I thought I would never finish it.  Now I just wish there was more to read!
0385505833|5.0|Skipping Christmas is the first Grisham book I have read.  It was a delightful story of the Kranks, who are suddenly empty nesters faced with their first Christmas without their daughter.<br />When Luther Krank hatches a plan to skip Christmas, the stage is set for mayhem and fun.<br />Factor in a neighborhood where everyone knows what everyone else is doing, and a bewhildered wife, and you have the makings of a truly great story.<br />I was able to read this book in 2 hours--it's a fast read, but is quite realistic.  You get the feeling that you are actually *in* the neighborhood.  You wonder about the mindset of people like Luther Krank.<br />I rate this book at 5 stars for the fact that it is a sweet book with a surprise twist.<br />Marguerite Nico<br />December 12, 2001
0553712837|3.0|I got this book hoping that it would help me get into the spirit of Christmas. It only served to get me in an even worse frame of mind.<br />I agreed with the Krank's decision at first but then felt very let down as the book continued. If John Grisham was trying to convey the spirit of Christmas, he failed in my eyes. I just thought the whole thing was a little too contrived.<br />I know the author is trying to spread his wings but this was not a good attempt. Just another commercial ploy to sell books (he got my money). Maybe he should just stick to what he does best-thrillers.<br />The shelves are filled with wonderful, heartwarming stories of the holiday spirit and those struggling to find it, this book should not be a part of them.
B00005OMTT|5.0|This is the first enigma cd I ever bought but it will not be the last. I always liked their music but never knew who they were becasue they had no particular singer or tune that got rotated all the time. Its a godo blend of every kind of music thats out but with mostly house/techno music. Its godo for background music and they never dissapoint. Their style of music is original and is unmatched by many producers out now. If you have never heard of this grouop then now is a good time to listen up.<br />get it!
B00005RFAI|5.0|This is a great, funky, hip-hop cd! I have been dancing around since first popping it into my player.<br />The song to attract me to purchasing the cd was &quot;Get the Party Started&quot;, a great motivator to get your behind shaking. However, every song is great, which is unusual  for such a commercial artist like Pink.<br />Most are fun dance tunes with the occasional heartfelt ballad like &quot;Family Portrait&quot; and &quot;Eventually&quot;. I was most surprised by the wonderfully bluesy &quot;Misery&quot; sung with Steven Tyler.<br />The song &quot;Respect&quot; is one of my favorites along with &quot;18 Wheeler&quot;.<br />This is one of those rare cds that is worth every penny spent!
B00005NEZ3|4.0|This album is definately not for everyone. It's for all the jaded people out there who are sick of the typical pop songs and stuff that are playing on radios nowadays. Since I'm one of them, it's refreshing that Gorillaz are doing something out of the ordinary.<BR>If you hate this album, I suggest you stick with N'sync or Britney Spears for bubble gum pop. (or whatever that fancies you)
0780625129|3.0|OK this is a good movie , it has a good story on rascial prejudice and how our own hatred only ignites violence after violence. But I was perturbed by the use of &quot;skinheads&quot; over and over again , and how they were all presented as shaved headed doc marten wearing nazi's. The characters in the films were neo-nazis , not skinheads. True skinheads are anti rascist working class people who believe in unity and family support. Skinheads were given a bad name by movies such as this who portrayed all of us skins as people who shave our heads and wear swastikas , and the media also ignited more violence from blacks on skins because they thought anyone who shaved their head and claimed to be a skin was a rascist. This film does the same. Constantly saying skinhead over and over. Now the film is great to watch in terms of it's message , but it still gives us skins a bad reputation.
0385335482|5.0|I was browseing in a bookstore and picked it up, read the back an bought it. Once I got to page 10 I was hooked! I finnished the book the same day. If you don't read this book your missing something good!
0380977273|2.0|There's a lot of hype about this being classic literature, and one of the best genre books ever. I disagree. Although Ray Bradbury is a superb writer, this book seems to fall short. The writing is overly poetic, and the dialogue is clunky. If you read this you may find yourself re-reading sentences to figure out what the hell was being said. Although not from the book, there are many, too many, sentences like this:<br />&quot;Will ran, didn't run. Jumped, didn't jump. He stomped his find on elephant shadows and cat whisker winds.&quot;<br />Again, this isn't an actual sentence from the book, but something similar to the type of writing.<br />Buy it, read it, experience it. These reveiws are just a matter of taste anyway. The book simply left me
B00003CXDZ|2.0|Or, A feast for the senseless.<BR><BR>I read the headlines of a few newspaper reviews and they kept using 'operatic' to describes this silly film. But if you've been to an opera, you'd know that they are finer, more original works. So I'd suggest describing this flick as operettic: light, silly, and pretty chatty for a musical.<BR><BR>As for it being excessive, I thought it was pretty tame. There were no big production numbers, just quick editing to give the effect of substance. Look at a Busby Berkley flick and compare the excess.<BR><BR>Still don't get why Toulouse Lautrec was played like a giddy bozo. He was a well-borne and educated artist. He enjoyed a good time and putting on funny clothes for the cameras, but nothing this silly.<BR><BR>One bonus: more garterbelts than Fredricks of Hollywood :)

B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is a fantastic movie!  A must see and then a must own!
B000005DQR|5.0|We all know through spritual knowledge that nobody is perfect. Well....but if there was anything as colse to being perfect as it could ..it would be this CD. There are atleast a 1000 samples and they all sound like they were specially made of this record. There are absolutely no filler tracks on this one and each and every minute of music is 100% fantastic. You dont have to take my word for it just look at all these other reviews. DJ shadow converts turntables into instruments of God! This CD also has 2 parts on one of its kind sample only driven rock opera &quot;what does your soul look like&quot; whis is an absolute masterpiece. The music on this CD is so good its almost surreal. DJ shadow is hands down the best DJ in the genre and is a master...i highly recomend this cd to anybody.
B00000J7I3|5.0|This is the best Crue album in my opinion. Young, raw and alive! Punkish-metal that is upbeat and full of youthfull energy! My favorites: Starry Eyes, Merry Go Round, and On with the Show! But I love the entire album....:)
B000005DQR|5.0|This is truely one of the most amazing CD's i have ever heard. The other day i was watching 100 greatest albums of all time on VH1 and \\"Revolver\\" by the beetels was number one. 20 or 30 thirty years from now i gurentee you all that on the same count down this masterpiece will be number one..yes its that great of an acheivement. Dj Shadow turns Vynel records into gold as he spins masterpiece after masterpiece of pure musical bliss. Even the intro (track 1) is realyl really cool and that is an example of how airthight flawless production values on the CD are. Also \\"What does youe soul look like\\" is one of a kind sample only driven rock opera..a pretty bold step for a Dj to take huh?..well Dj Shadow pulls it off gloriously. His music sometime gives me the shivers and touches me some place deep inside me that i never knew was there. There are light toe tapping tracks like \\"organ Donor\\" to dark and mysterious tracks like \\"Mutual Slump\\" to trip hop gems like \\"Midnight in a perfect world\\" to get you hooked to this CD..hooked is too mild of a word to describe this one...addicted is more appropriate. There are absolutely no filler tracks and every single song is fantastic. Once i start listning to this jem i always have to finish listning to it right till the very last song otherwise i dont feel satisfied and feel uneasy for the rest of the day. Buy this cd blindly.
B0000067L4|2.0|This supergroup recorded two (mainly) studio albums,FRESH CREAM,and DISRAELI GEARS, and then a studio/live mix WHEELS ON FIRE. When these three recordings came out over a generation ago, I played them endlessly, and like many another aspiring lead guitarist, listened and played with them on a regular basis. GOODBYE, the fourth, was a major disapointment. The trio's fresh exuburance seemed to evaporate with noisy,jumbled live performances of songs I already knew, just another jam session. Other than &quot;Badge&quot;, it offered almost nothing, and &quot;Badge&quot; didn't compare with the clean, fresh sounds of before. Make this your last Cream purchase, only after you've tasted the great earlier albums. Oh yes, the Broadway song and dance look of the cover still seems a little strange.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is one if not the best picture of the year. It has beautiful and very talented stars, s captivating love story and wonderful and expressive music. I have been a fan of the director since Strictly Ballroom and he has created a luscious and blindlingly delicious world of vivid and seductive color were love is all that matters and worth any price. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, as Satine and Christian, generate enough heat to melt the screen and give what could be their best performances to date. Their chemistry is absolutely amazing. The supporting cast is equally as talented. Truth, Beauty, Freedom and Love!!!!!!!
630242335X|5.0|Star Trek 6, in my opinion, is one of the smartest and one of the most understated and underestimated Sci-Fi movies of all time (of coarse because it's a star trek movie).  Star Trek 6 is a cleverly written Sci-Fi murder mystery with a very powerful and tension filled climax.  ST6 has a great theme song and amazing special effects.  It's also the final cruise of the original enterprise crew.    A movie to be seen by trekies and non-trekies alike!
B000059XUP|1.0|Anybody who claims that this movie was entertaining was either drunk or stoned.  The first time I saw it I was hammered, so I thought it was decent.  But upon further review, and sadly sober, I realized what an insult this film is to the memory of Brandon Lee.  The cinematography isn't bad, and the music is decent giving the film a gothic feel so long as nobody opens their mouth, but the script is best left to our friends at MST3K.  Our 'hero' is a weakling who resembles nothing of what Brandon started.  He a blubbering baby who never stops weeping, and Sarah is a character you'd just as soon read about in the obituaries.  The third installment of this series (The Crow: Salvation) is much better than City of Angels, but it remains a far cry from the original.  If you're looking for a gothic movie, check out Dark City.  It's from the same director as the original Crow, and it's a righteous classic.
B00005QW5X|5.0|This was a great movie and a brilliant DVD. If you don't take the opportunity to see it, you are a cinematic idiot and i feel sorry for you. Soundtrack is amazing, the artwork and costuming are fabulous, and the storyline is straighforward and moving. This is one of the best movies ever and is straight up your alley if you like films like &quot;Rocky Horror Picture Show.&quot; Go see this movie!!!!!
B00005QDW1|1.0|If I could have given this zero stars, I would have. Y'know, I'm all for artists growing and exploring new directions, but what a piece of garbage this is (no offense to THAT band!). Like &quot;a disappointed fan&quot;, I pre-ordered this CD and got all excited when I heard it had been released a week early. I ALMOST cancelled the order when I saw the band on MTV2 and heard Gwen talking about how great hip-hop is nowdays, and how it was influencing her. Now I wish I had!
6305546789|5.0|HALLOWEEN marks John Carpenter's fist and unexpected strike in the world of horror.<br />You can't do a movie better on this budget ($320,000). Don't expect too much in the first half of the movie. BUT the rest of the movie is worth to wait a century for it!<br />Pros:<br />- unbeatable atmosphere in the whole movie<br />- Anamorphic Widescreen and Full Screen format<br />- Dolby Digital 5.1, Dolby Stereo Surround and oringinal Mono<br />- THX certified<br />- the main menu is well done and scary<br />- tons of extras (trivias, photos, radio and tv spots, trailers,...)<br />- it's THE original<br />Cons:<br />- no commentary track<br />Forget all those SCREAM-copies... This is definetly THE evergreen must-have horror movie!
0761536434|5.0|This is one of those great books that you just can't put down. Lots of research was done for this, and there are great quotes from some of the most influential people in video game history.

6302794331|5.0|I enjoy this movie as much as any that I have ever watched.  The music is wonderful, the characters are so perfectly cast, and the story is timeless.  It is easily my favorite Christmas movie.
630575067X|3.0|I almost didn't write this review.  Unlike so many others, I have not seen the original trilogy.  While I cannot hope to know the significance of this film as a part of the entire phenomenon, it does give me the advantage of being able to look at it unbiased light.  I can well understand why many loyal fans of the trilogy were disappointed.  This film desperately needed a Harrison Ford.  It lacked the emotion and charisma he brings to all his roles.  And whether or not you consider the character of Jar Jar Binks to be racially offensive, you have to admit he was so annoying that it was a relief when he finally shut up.  I gave the film three stars purely for the special effects and the fight sequence between Darth Mol and Ewan McGregor.  If you're a fan of the trilogy, then this film is a necessity to your collection.  I, however, felt that the story line was rather weak.  And aside from Darth Mol, none of the other characters are particularly interesting.
B000002UCQ|5.0|When this astounding triple-album set (now available as two CDs) was first released shortly after The Beatles' break-up, Rolling Stone magazine hailed it as the rock-and-roll equivalent of War and Peace. Thirty years have passed, and I still heartily agree with the assessment. And Harrison has rarely equalled its musical quality since then.<br />The album was co-produced by Phil Spector, which should come as no surprise upon hearing the rich production and layers of vocal and instrumental harmony. The music really soars, and the album's acid test is  &quot;Isn't It a Pity,&quot; whose seven-minute-plus length is just one second short of &quot;Hey Jude's&quot; time. Yet thanks to Ringo Starr's incessant drumbeat, Billy Preston's keyboard work, and Harrison's oft-overdubbed voice, the song just builds and builds, ever enchanting instead of boring.<br />Among many other highlights:<br />* &quot;Apple Scruffs,&quot; Harrison's tribute to the Beatles fans who used to hang around their studio for hours. The harmonica blast that opens the song is like a clarion call.<br />* The infamous &quot;My Sweet Lord,&quot; for which Harrison was sued by the publishers of the Chiffons song &quot;He's So Fine&quot; for plagiarism. Funny, they never sue about the *loser* songs, do they?<br />* The rock-out number &quot;Awaiting on You All,&quot; with its wicked ad-lib, &quot;The Pope owns fifty-one percent of General Motors/The stock exchange is the only thing he's qualified to quote us.&quot;<br />Harrison is, of course, a devotee of the Krishna movement, and he sometimes lets his sermonizing get the best of him on the album's songs, but not excessively. It was only on subsequent albums that his preachiness  gradually drove away many of his listeners.<br />The weakest part of the album is the final part of its second CD (originally the third LP, subtitled &quot;Apple Jam&quot;). It's a discordant jam session whose song titles (&quot;I Remember Jeep,&quot; &quot;Thanks for the Pepperoni&quot;) are an indication of the songs' dispensibility.<br />But the main part of the album truly soars, and for my money, Harrison never recorded another album this rich until Thirty-Three and a Third (1977). All Things Must Pass showed just how unsung the &quot;unsung hero&quot; of The Beatles really was.ot;) are an indication of the songs' dispensibility.<br />But the main part of the album truly soars, and for my money, Harrison never recorded another album this rich until Thirty-Three and a Third (1977).

B00005N9CV|2.0|Diana has some strengths as a fine pianist and a decent singer with loads of originality. Unfortunately, this album does not display any of them. This dumbed-down muzak must have been the idea of a record label and not of the artist. If you listen back to Krall's original stuff, it bears no resemblance. Come on Diana, go back to making real jazz.
B00005QDW1|4.0|. . . I am torn as to how I should rate this album.  I am such a die-hard fan of No Doubt, and especially Gwen, that it is hard for me to say anything negative about them.<br />But if you listen to the music and haunting lyrics of &quot;Tragic Kingdom,&quot; and to a lesser extent, &quot;Return of Saturn,&quot; this album just isn't the same No Doubt.<br />The band decided to &quot;go Jamaican&quot; in this album, and for the most part it worked, but after listening to this album over and over again since I got it, I have to say it doesn't have the same magic that their past albums have had.<br />If I could talk to the band right now face to face I would have to say that I think they should swing drastically back to their ska/punk roots and leave the mainstream music alone.<br />That isn't to say that there aren't several very good songs on this album, (including &quot;Hey Baby,&quot; which I am sorry - but - I happen to like - and screw the rest of you up tight reviewers who won't let the band have a little fun.  If you had read up on the origins of this song and what was going on when they wrote it, it is about their fun times in Jamaica, and they have every right to make a song about that.)  The best songs on this album have already been mentioned by other reviewers, but what I wanted to mention and comment on was the FEEL of this album.<br />After listening to &quot;Tragic Kingdom,&quot; for the first time I was dazed as to how good it was, I love Gwen's lyrics and vocals on that album, and the band's energy and feel for that album are unbelievable.  After listening to this newest album I just don't have that same feeling.<br />So over-all I will rate this a 4, it is still a No Doubt album, and it is still Gwen singing, but dammit - for one thing put some pants back on your drummer, no one wants to see that (Gwen on the other hand . . .) - and if any members of No Doubt, or anyone close to them reads these reviews, PLEASE, consider going back to your roots, rediscover your &quot;Tragic Kingdom,&quot; for that is where your music is waiting for you again.scover your &quot;Tragic Kingdom,&quot; for that is where your music is waiting for you again.
0345448898|5.0|When I wrote a review of The Golden Compass, I swore I would stay away from the religious issues raised by these books, but with so many reviews decrying them as dangerous and subversive, I feel a need to defend them.  I am sick to death of wonderful books, such as these, being pushed aside by people whose delicate sensibilities are offended by any viewpoint that contradicts their own.<BR>Are these books anti-Christian?  Yes.  Blatantly so, especially in the third.  Are they a dangerous read for impressionable young children?  Well, if you are a Christian parent, I wouldn't recommend reading this as a bedtime story to your 7-year-old, but I wouldn't suggest these books for any 7-year-old, religious or otherwise.  There is darkness.  There is violence.  There are ethical and philosophical questions completely out of reach for a child that young.  A twelve-year-old, however, should be old enough to be presented with an idea without necessarily accepting it, especially when that idea comes in the form of a fantasy novel.  Because that's what it is: Fantasy.  And the truth is, children understand fantasy better than most adults.  Far too many adults seem to fear fantasy, because they've forgotten how to keep the pretend separate from the real.  Kids don't have that problem.  To suggest that these books, all on their own, will drive your twelve-year-old child away from the church is almost as ridiculous as suggesting that the Harry Potter books promote witchcraft (which, by the way, is a valid, peaceful religion that in no way involves Satan worship).<BR>Yes, if you are devoutly religious, you will be offended by Pullman's portrayal of God and religion.  However, if you are an open-minded person, you will be able to appreciate the fabulous imagination that went into creating the worlds and characters of these books, not to mention Pullman's incredible skill in descriptive writing.  Then you can put the books back on your shelf and go back to church, knowing full well that it was Just A Story.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is a great cd!! They're very good for alternative. I'd give it 10 out of 5 stars if i could! Linkin Park has good, non - nasty music, and i hope they never get into that. They're amazing!! I recommend this cd to everyone(teens).
6305603847|5.0|This movie, when i first saw it, i thought was incredible.  But after viewing this film a couple of times i realize the true brilliance of the band Pink Floyd.  This movie depicts a man breaking himself away from the outside world, and creating a &quot;wall&quot;.  Another Brick in the wall shows different reasons for the building of the wall, and why this man pink is going slowly mad.  Pink, the main character i belive is the former member Syd Barret, which went schytsofrantic, and left the band in the late 60's.  If you watch the movie closely, you can realize how brilliant Pink Floyd really is.  Everything, represents something, like the song &quot;Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 2&quot; depicts conformaty, and as you watch this part, you think the children are just destroying the school, but it shows children walking into a machine, and coming out all the same.  The movie has strange masks, representing conformaty.  Pink Floyd represents a lot of things like this through the whole movie.  The Wall isn't just a story about a man, it shows The whole World War Two story, through &quot;secret&quot; messages, that you have to figure out.  I still have yet to find out what they mean through this movie fully, but I am slowy piecing it all together.  When you watch The Wall, you aren't just watching a crummy motion picture that a band put together as a publicity stunt, you are watching a brilliant story, which defies most movies.  If you like Pink Floyd's music, this is a great movie, and it is very fun to watch.  When you listen to the Album, you realize what all the songs mean, and it makes you have that tingle down your spine.  When i watch this movie, I realize the strangest things, and I get that tingle down my spine, that makes me feel like i need to watch it again and again.  <br />Pink Floyd - The Wall.. pure brilliance...<br />Pink Floyd is really the band that no one realizes is really good, and i believe that if anyone gives this band a listening, you can realize how good they are.<br />This movie is incredible.
B00003Q43A|4.0|I may not be the only one who made this observation with this movie.  I watched War of the Worlds (that invasion from Mars movie from the 50s) again recently, I saw so many parallels between ID4 and War of the Worlds.  ID4 has many new twists though and an expanded story.  Overall, ID4 endures as an excellent movie with good acting, superior special effects, and a compelling story overall.
B000056BGI|4.0|The remastered sound is interesting - I suspect a lot of the noodley bits and announcements may have been taken from vinyl, but the actual tracks appear to be from tape. They are brighter and have more hiss than the BGO remaster (which usually means that less NoNoise has been used - a good thing) We may have to await the official Chrysalis remaster this year for a definitive edition
0446608955|5.0|Well I thought this book was great Also I am trying to find a book that can top this I dont really read alot.  I sorta don't like reading but this book made me read. I was really willing to know what was gonna happen so yah Read this book. From person that doesnt read alot i suggest it...
B00005214X|5.0|The sound of this CD is much improved over the very poor 1987 double CD - brighter and clearer. The bonus tracks are worthwhile and the packaging is wonderful. It would have been nice to have the Apple Jam logo as originally issued on the 3rd vinyl disc, but the music is all there, as excellent as ever. Finally he had proved to the world that he could write more than 1 or 2 good songs per album.<BR>I'd like to hear Steve Hoffman of DCC have a crack at remastering this album to hear a definitive sonic edition.
B000009QPE|5.0|Slayer's shows what true aggression is with a great album. Reign In Blood is under 30 minutes in length but it's makes up for it by being a brutal masterpiece of metal.
B00005U2LM|5.0|I don't think anybody would disagree with me when I say this has<BR>been the worst year for hip hop...possibly EVER.<BR>Sure, Jay-Z's album was tight.  But what else?  You have to know<BR>that when Eve, Ludachris, Bubba Sparxx, Nelly and Trick Daddy<BR>are the top players in the game that something is seriously wrong.<BR>As far as the Wu goes, their last two albums as a group have<BR>been rejected by fans (unfairly in my opinion) and have struggled<BR>to regain the crown they held around 1994-1996.<BR>Wu-Tang Forever was waaaaaay too long and loaded with filler.<BR>The W lacked a cohesive group feel and was loaded with unecessary guest appearances.<BR>And Iron Flag??<BR>To make a long story short, this album is just plain incredible.<BR>The highlight is the production which always keeps<BR>the listener on their toes.  Some beats are loud and hype (In<BR>The Hood), some have a west-coast gangsta feel (Chrome Wheels),<BR>some sound like they came from DJ Premier's files (Rules), some are smooth (Babies), some feature Wu-esque samples (Iron Flag) and others are just completely unique (Uzi, Soul Power).<BR>The latter features a flute and drum sample that sounds like it was recorded with a tribe in the African jungle.<BR>Lyrically, the Clan is on point as usual and the weaker mcs (U-God, RZA) spend less time on the mic as the stronger ones <BR>(Inspectah Deck, Method Man).<BR>There is no filler and there isn't even one track recorded with the purpose of getting commercial airplay.<BR>I don't know if this will sell a lot of copies or become one of<BR>MTV's babies, but this is definitely the album Wu fans have been<BR>waiting for.
B00005OMTT|5.0|Enigma's songs have always captivated me in many ways. However, it wasn't until I actually bought Cretu's 3rd disc, &quot;Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!&quot;, that I realized the extent of the spirituality and openness of this music. If you have ever gotten a chance to look at the disc, you will see pictures of naked men lined up. You can only see from their head down to their torso. Basically they have all of these pictures of mechanical devices covering their heads and diagrams showing their body mechanisms (like their ribs, digestive system, lungs, etc.) It's almost depicting the human body as a machine, which is true in so many ways. At first I was taken aback at how someone could so graphically portray humans are lifeless machines doing things based on cause and effect and the like (the actual scientific theory is called 'mechanism'). But I think if you look deeper you will find another meaning to what the pictures represent.<br />I think the same thing happens when you learn something in life and then listen to an Enigma song, and you realize how true and how [in]vulnerable and how clear it is all at the same time.<br />Growing up in a christian family, music like this is considered controversial and even more taboo than drugs and alcohol, however I think if you were like me at first(skeptical), give it LOTS of time and when you are ready you will find tranceful, truthful, and dance-beat-filled music that is simply irresistible.
B000002KIE|5.0|Let me tell you. I'm not a fan of old punk rock. It just seems to slow and wussy. That was to say until I bought this album. This is awesome. With all there songs at a maximum of 3 chords. You cannot go wrong.<br />  Most people think that the SEX PISTOLS only wrote 2 good songs. &quot;Anarchy in the U.K&quot;, and &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;. Anyone who owns this album would punch you in the face for that!!<br />  Their are som many great songs such as &quot;Problems&quot;, &quot;Bodies&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot; etc. So...... don't just sit there listening to me blab on about how great this album is.<br />GO BUY IT!!!!!!!!
B000000Y87|5.0|Bill Evans' led a very tragic life, yet he gave the world this incredibly deep, soulful music that continues to mesmerize listeners to this day. &quot;Sunday at the Village Vanguard&quot; is one of those albums that is truly a classic in every sense of the word. This is not jazz for the faint of heart! While Bill Evans and the trio's playing may sound relaxing, there is a darkness to a lot of the material that draws you in and makes you part of it. I can't quite explain it properly here, but once you hear this album, you will never be the same again.
B00003CXAA|5.0|We all know &quot;God Father&quot; - the DVD is good - so are the sounds (considering the fact that the movie is over 2 decades old) Certanly &quot;a must own classic&quot;
B00003CXZ1|3.0|Since I've never played the video game, I don't know if the movie was better or worse. The plot was a bit weak, but I think that's because the majority of the budget went to special effects.<br />The physical attributes (is it real or memorex?) of Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft aside, tomb raiding has a sort of mystical draw for audiences. Although no one will ever be able to replace Indiana Jones, many will make the attempt, including this movie.<br />Fortunately, for Indiana Jones, his title is safe.
B00005NW02|5.0|If it can be believed, this is the same four men that in 1998 released their self-titled album.  That first album never really hinted at the level of maturity this band has reached.  The songs are more unified wholes, and the lyrics are meaningful, even in their occasional humor.<br />It is one anthem after another and easily the best album of 2001.  Probably too heavy for some, but just right for what America's youth needs: someone commercially acceptable with a sense of the responsibility that comes with the power of mass communication.<br />System of a Down has it nailed, and if they continue to evolve at this rate, no one will even be able to understand their next album (it will be that high above our normal level of consciousness).
B00003CXXS|3.0|This is not the worst movie ever- but close to it. This is what you would call Jurassic Park Lame(JPL). How much more boring can you can an action movie. This movie is on the edge of being a drama it has so little action and since it was so close and didn;t have any of the elements, this is what you can say- BORING! There is nothing that can make you jump out of your seat or make you sit on the edge of your seat, which is what an action/adventure movie should. The first two Jurassic Parks are so much better. I would of loved it if it wasn't for the no action. If you want something good get Rush Hour II.
B00005B36H|4.0|Lateralus is a great example of how musicians (who aren't afraid of the judgement or prejudices of others) can and will evolve: conceptually, mentally, emotionally, even spiritually.  This album is best listened to after previewing Tool's entire catalog, from Opiate through the often-overlooked Salival (and throw in A Perfect Circle and Peach to understand Tools' other outside influences).  If you listen to Lateralus in this mindset, nothing you hear on the new album will come as a great surprise, but rather more like a comforting reassurance.  Your old friends are back in town, and when you meet them at the bar, it's just like old times.<br />Since I've had the album, almost every track has been my favorite at one time or another.  It's really difficult to nail down exactly what on this album shines over the rest.  Each one has its own profound lyrics, incredible guitar riffs, void-filling bass, and almost epileptic time changes.  This is good solid songwriting from mature individuals who work well together.<br />The reason I gave this a 4 instead of 5 is that Tool seems to have forgotten that you can write a fast or heavy song without a slow interlude.  While I do enjoy the slower portions of all the songs, I find myself wishing that they had let loose with the adrenaline and not stopped until a song was over.  Not so much what I would call a flaw in the album as much as something that was a little disappointing to me personally.  The album deserves a 4.5/5, but until Amazon has an option for that rating, the 4 stands.
B00005BCPC|5.0|I like it a lot, you should check it out.
B00005JKQX|4.0|Having read the biography of the highly complex and none too likable math genius, John Nash, one cannot help but be disappointed in the movie version.  Russell Crowe is superb and brings all his talent and skills into this performance, but mainstream Hollywood director Ron Howard tends to go for general audience appeal.  There should have been more emphasis on the astounding work on game theory that led to his Nobel prize.  And bringing in less flattering aspects of Nash's behavior and brash personality would have made for much better drama than the ones contrived to tug at our heartstrings.  Still, general audiences who know little or nothing of Nash will be impressed with the way the story is spun.  Too bad more of the truth couldn't have been laid out for us to digest.  It's a real life drama that needs no Hollywood gimics or fictionalized script.
B000059XXZ|4.0|This , Batman is probably the best in the series , and while it is much darker the the 1960's series it does well. This is because of a number of things first Danny Elfmans score which in my view is just like the batman: dark , brooding , and mysterious and princes contribution also does well 'partyman'. Next the excellent Jack Nicholson as the hilarious however disturbed and evil Joker cracking jokes and pulling pranks personal fave lines include; 'well miss Vale is there another rooster in the hen house?' and 'never rub another mans rhubarb' Kim basinger is good as bruces romance Vicky Vale and the rest of the cast do well , especially the guy who plays liuetanant Eckhart - a corrupt cop working with Jack napier ( the joker before being dropped in a vat of chemicals), the story concentrates on Bruce Wayne a private man who as batman fights crime at night . basinger is the photographer who wants to get the first pics of him. The joker starts terroroisising Gotham by poisoning food and  cosmectics. it is up to bats to stop him and realising that it in fact was the joker who murdered his mum and dad wants a bit of revenge (however in the comics and tv show the joker never killed any of the waynes.) yes there sre flaws and the movie may be a little rusty but this is top quality entertainment and is worth buying.I was also impressed with the batmobile and as i said nicholson plays the part of the joker magnificently and is probably one of the best villains ever , being funny while evil (he kills more people than any other batman movie villain and takes relish in it aswell)i will end by saying that this movie is worth seeing and is much better than the feeble batman returns. Buy it because remember we all need a superhero some time or another.
0060920084|5.0|Those who have become familiar with Bill Bryson from his massively popular &quot;A Walk in the Woods,&quot; might be a bit taken aback by &quot;The Lost Continent.&quot;  While &quot;Woods&quot; is a typical Bryson book, well-researched, opinionated and, of course, first rate travel writing, Bryson smoothed the edges of his biting humor ever so slightly.  That is most decidedly NOT the case with &quot;The Lost Continent,&quot; in which Bryson heaps out much his trademark satire and humor which is at times decidely not good-natured.<br />The book takes Bryon on an automobile journey across America and back, mostly through small towns and historical sights.  He brings an intersting perspective in that he had spent the previous decade living in Great Britain, and this journey helped reacquaint him with America.  In this, he is a perfect commentator, combining his native Midwestern sensibilities with an adult perspective in which much of what he sees he does not expect because of his long absence from his native soil.<br />Throughout the book, Bryson make references to his father and the family trips taken across the U.S. when he was a child.  In this, &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; is a very personal work for him.  He dedicated the book to his late father and even though dad is a constance source of (very funny) satire, it also manages to be quite touching.<br />Overall, this is an excellent work from a first rate travel writer and humorist.  But if you don't like an edge to your humor, you should probably pass.
0553260111|5.0|Reading this highly explosive excerpt from the thriller is as intense as being the main character and dodging the arrray of gun fire and if that wasn't enough he must also overcome some fierce typhoon crazed weather. The best excerpt I have read , can't wait to read the book and for the movie.
B00003CXXS|1.0|Jurassic Park 3 is one of the worst films of the year, it is below mediocre and contains a laughable plot delivered by a bunch of mediocre actors. This movie is so pathetic it doesn't even deserve your consideration, it is a piece of manufactured cinema with no heart or soul. The action scenes are pointless and unsuspenseful, the acting is horrible, the plot is unconvincing, and the musical score is laughable. I can give you a hundred reasons as to why I think this movie is bad. I realised this film was going to be horrible the second the opening titles popped on the screen with the Jurassic Park 3 logo and the extremely lame and clichéd claw marks that make you 'jump out of your seat' to go to the nearest restroom and vomit. The opening prologue is even more laughable, with its horrible blue screen utilisation and bad movie score. The next fifteen minutes get even worse: Laura Dern's fakely delivers dialogue and Sam Neil begins conjuring up other pointless theories about raptor intelligence. Wasn't it obvious in the first Jurassic Park film that the raptors were intelligent? I somehow always knew that the raptors could communicate and to explore that entire concept on one movie is redundant. Next, the island we visited in The Lost World has somewhat gone through some magical ecological changes since 1997. Instead of being a jungle/forest environment it's now a swampy/jungle landscape. Not only has the environment changed but the inhabitents have also gone through some changes as well. It's like the animals are evolving in a matter of years; the velociraptors have changed colours: Palaeontologist Jack Horner suggested adding new feathers atop the male animals based on evidence that suggested the velociraptors carried feathers; the Tyrannosaur also has a new personality in Jurassic Park 3: instead of being a ferocious predator, she's a scavanger who quickly gets beaten by the spinosaurus. Whose fault is it that the animals have magically morphed? None other than Palaeontogist Jack Horner who decided to screw continuity in order to give a more accurate depiction of the animals based on his theories and beliefs. Screw accuracy, I want sequels to have continuity. The musical score is boring and repititious and unlike its last two predecessors: Don Davis' score places the Jurassic Park theme in unnecessary moments and gives no life to the movie whatsoever. Davis adds nothing to the Jurassic Park franchise and neither does the movie's director Joe Johnston. I hope that someday someone with intelligence is handed the throne of directing a Jurassic Park movie, someone who can save a dying franchise recognised by brainless summer moviegoers and five/fifteen year old boys, someone who can return dignity to the already dead franchise. Erase this hollywood mistake by making a Jurassic Park 4 with an actual subtitle, that completely dismisses the retarded brother Jurassic Park 3 is to the original Jurassic Park and the highly underrated The Lost World: Jurassic Park.
0618135871|5.0|This treatise on lust as a life force, juxtaposed against the onset of old age and the acceptance of one's inevitable mortality, is worthy of mention in the same breath as Nabokov's masterful treatise on love, Lolita.  Like Lolita, the emotional power of the prose quickly forces the reader to disregard the immorality inherent in the significant age difference between the main character and the object of his desire.  The narrator, David Kepesh, is a 62-year-old college professor who routinely seduces his female students.  But in his relationship with the 24-year-old Consuela, he finds himself enslaved by his lust for her.  Through Kepesh, Roth eloquently explores the conflict between lust and personal freedom, and the struggle to come to terms with the onset of old age and one's own mortality.<br />Philip Roth is without doubt America's most eloquent literary voice, and The Dying Animal is perhaps his finest work.
B000003TA4|5.0|this is such a great cd. one of my best cds. it brought good music to the mainstream and since nirvana there have been no good mainstream bands. i think this is the best cd of the 90s. i think Nirvana is the best band of the 90s. buy this and the rest of their cds. i miss kurt cobain. had he not died there would still be Nirvana.
B00005B36H|1.0|i guess if you live long enough you see just about everything. this is easily the worst album i've heard in years. a few years back i heard undertow and thought it was a great heavy rock album, so i bought the next album and it was a little different but still had some good ideas. then tool's singer did the perfect circle record which i really liked, so i was looking forward to lateralus with great expectations.<BR>radio stations were playing &quot;schism&quot; for a month or so before the album came out and i thought it was lame. but i still waited to hear the whole thing before making a final judgement. after picking up the cd, i drove home and examined the case and the booklet which was very creative, then i sat in my room to really listen to the whole thing. i honestly couldn't get through the first two songs. this music bores me to tears! there is nothing inspiring about this album at all. <BR>i'm not a huge pink floyd fan, but to compare this to &quot;dark side of the moon&quot; is ludicrous! don't get me wrong, these guys are good musicians but i think they're more concerned with creating a mysterious, avante garde image than writing good songs. <BR>i recently read an interview with the singer where he claims that tool are the next metallica!?! i wonder if he'll remember those words in five years when he's waiting on line at the soup kitchen!
B00000DHRZ|2.0|OKAY THIS IS NOT PUNK. IF YOU WANT OFFSPRING JUST BUY SMASH OR THE SELF-TITLED. PRETTY FLY FOR A WHITE GUY IS JUST A HORRIBLE POP SONG AS IS WHY DONT YOU GET A JOB.

0553579908|5.0|Mr. Martin continues his Epic in this book. The world he introduced to us in A Game of Thrones starts to flesh out. The old king is dead and there is a question about the legitimacy of his heirs. Thus a peaceful succession is prevented and three claims to the throne of the Seven Kingdoms are made, as well as two claims to the thrones of kingdoms that were independent before the Taragaryen Kings came to the Seven Kingdoms three hundred years before. And let us not the forget that the last of the Taragaryen House is making a claim to the throne from exile in the islands and lands of the east. <BR>This book has more of the magical element in it than the first of this series, as the Night's Watch at the north border of the seven kingdoms comes to realise that there is a great deal of truth to the old legends, and that they have more to worry about beyond their Wall than just the barbarians. Also, one of the kings, whose claim is the strongest, but whose support is the weakest, has converted to a different god, and the priestess who converted him is a sorceress to boot. This will have an effect on the story.<BR>Mr. Martin continues using the almost agonizing tactic of telling each chapter from the viewpoint of individual characters. This makes it more realistic, I believe, as we then come to know more characters, and Mr. Martin does not make them unrealistic, as they are all prone to misperceptions, and very human tendencies.<BR>Also, I believe that he very realistically portrays the class differences from kings to lords, from powerful lords to weak and minor ones, and from the minor nobility to the serfs and peasants. Also in this struggle are those who see and are willing to risk themselves to rise to higher station, whether a serf who would become a knight, or lords who would become kings. It is a very harsh world, and those who rise can also fall. We see this more in this book than in the first, and I suspect that we will see it through-out the series. The most realistic element that I see is that first of all, very few people in this are cut-and-dried, out-and-out villains or heroes, and characters that we like do not always survive, let alone prevail. I have mine opinions about where this story will go, and who will be most important, but it is too early to tell. I do think that I can see the beginning of a quest element in this story.<BR>I definitely recommend this series to other readers.
B000001EL3|5.0|This album did for KISS what &quot;Sgt. Pepper,&quot; or even &quot;Revolver,&quot; did for The Beatles.  The KISS sound, epitomised on &quot;Alive!,&quot; was bumped up a notch on &quot;Destroyer.&quot;<BR>Many fans have criticized &quot;Destroyer&quot; for producer Bob Ezrin's use of strings and a choir, but he added a new dimension to KISS that made them more interesting.  If groups are not allowed to experiment a little, they will grow stale.  Every KISS album shouldn't sound like a re-hash of &quot;Dressed To Kill,&quot; though that was a good album in itself.<BR>The segue between &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; and &quot;King Of The Nightime World&quot; is still the best in rock, and no one has been able to better it, much less duplicate it.<BR>This album showed KISS at their creative peak, with &quot;Love Gun&quot; being the only album aftewards to give &quot;Destroyer&quot; a run for its money.<BR>It's also been revealed in Gene Simmons' excellent autobiography, &quot;KISS and Make-Up,&quot; that Ace Frehley played very few of the excellent guitar solos on &quot;Destroyer,&quot; and that a session player had to fill in.<BR>&quot;Destoyer&quot; was a milestone album of the 1970s, not only for KISS, but for rock in general.
0553106635|5.0|Mr. Martin's epic continues. In A Clash of Kings, we had five kings contending for the throne. In A Storm of Swords, that number drops, but with the promise of more kings to come. And the terrors beyond the Wall reveal themselves, and we start to find just how deadly they are, and we start to think, like the Night's Watch, just how ridiculous it is for the nobility to be squabbling over the throne when the true threat is beyond the Wall. Not that Mr. Martin's work is ridiculous. The character perspectives are realistic, and we see how it is easy for the contenders to forget the Wall: it has been forgotten for generations, and other than a few people who actually chose to become part of the Night's Watch, the ranks of these men who guard the Seven Kingdoms from the Others and their wights are men convicted of some crime or who fell a-foul of their local lord, or in the case of some, who had joined the losing side in this or that struggle. Also, other than the barbarians and their occasional raids south of the Wall, there has been no signifigant threat, and the Others are but tales told to scare children. The Seven Kingdoms will learn that they are a fact, and this book starts that.<BR>Betrayal, alliances, ambition, honor, necessity, these are all part of the story, and Mr. Martin does not keep the action out of the story, and new character add their perspectives. That does not mean that they are safe, for at least two of the characters whose perspectives we saw in the earlier books are dead by the beginning of this book, and probably more will die in the series.<BR>He continues to write in the character-per-chapter style that makes this series so different. The only complaint I have is that that style makes it easy for a person to become impatient, and skip to another chapter, or to pick it up at the wrong chapter. That does not impact the quality of the books, however, and the reader need not lose heart: the character developement in this story is tied up in the action in perhaps the best blend I have ever read, and it is a fast-paced series. The quest element I saw in the second book is still there in this one, and we are introduced to the enigmatic character known only as Coldhands. I believe him to be signifigant, though not the hero by any means.<BR>Those who like involved stories will like this book, as well as those who like action. Those who like flesh and bone characters will like this series as well. I like this series for its original approach and the fact that the quest element is not so obvious and immediate in the story, and I like this series for the realistic characters, the most realistic that I have probably ever read.<BR>The Song of Ice and Fire has rapidly joined The Wheel of Time and The Lord of the Rings in my personal canon of original, high quality fiction.
B000024D4R|5.0|There isn't a whole lot to say that hasn't yet been said about this, my personal choice as favorite Pink Floyd album. It encapsules all the best that was the group and hits the band's pinnacle before it's more widely acclaimed follow-up, &quot;The Wall.&quot;  Slow chugging melodies rife with perfectly accentuated sound effects and the trademark headphone orgasms that have always been their bread and butter, this album seems to be Roger Water's best lyrical effort ever.  Before he took the band and went a bit too far with &quot;The Wall,&quot; he crafted a brilliant four part thematic album which attacks at various times, religious sheep, working class dogs, political pigs, and a few other human stereotypes with his razor sharp wit and acidic tongue.  Mason and Wright have a grand time demonstrating the value Waters would sadly underestimate down the road, Waters himself anchors the sound with his thundering bass and guitarist extraordinaire David Gilmour fires off riff after searing riff of stinging Stratocaster leads, satin smooth strumming, and his uncanny scat-like ability to, as one reviewer put it, &quot;make his guitar talk.&quot; There are fewer than a handful of guitarists in rock's long history who can match the pure emotion and passion that Gilmour has laid down in his career. In fact, one of the more underappreciated aspects of the Floyd was their musical prowess.  These four fellows are all exceptional talents at putting together a song so carefully crafted that not one note ever seems out of place or excessive (hello Edward Van Halen).  Side note: I have never figured out why the band has refused to release the 8-track version of &quot;Pigs On The Wing&quot; which featured a really nice solo that bridged the two parts together quite nicely. On the 8-track the song wasn't separated into two smaller book-end songs and I wish someone would restore that long lost solo. <BR>Either way, this is Pink Floyd with every you want: spacey effects, stoned rhythms,breathtaking musical chops, brilliant social commentary, and excellent art work.  If the theatrics the band degenerated into after Waters took total control seem a bit over-the-top at times to you and the trippy free-form of earlier albums has you bewildered, check out this album and find where it all came together.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This was the most incredibly well made movies i've seen in a long time.  This movie has more twists than any other i've ever seen.  The backwards story is great.  Sure it may not be the most believable movie, like the weird memory problem he has, but who cares.  This is a fantastic movie that will keep you guessing to the very end and anybody who didn't like this movie is just too stupid to understand it.
B000050XEI|5.0|This is probably Enya's best since Watermark. Rich in melody with very visual lyrics---It drips with elegance suited only for those who understand how beautiful life is.  Anything less than 5 stars is profane---ignore any less---This makes for a perfect day...

0446310786|5.0|&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is mainly about the trial of a black man for raping a white woman -- an offense not taken lightly in 1930s Alabama. And while a rape trial is very serious topic, Harper Lee chooses to write the book from the point of view of an eight-year-old girl. She takes her time getting around to the trial, writing at length about the exploits of Scout, her brother Jem, and their friend Dill. There are lots of laughs -- particularly the night the three of them went to see Boo Radley's house, and Jem ripped his pants so badly he had to return home without them.<br />There are also lots of tearful moments, especially after Tom Robinson got convicted and after he died. He hadn't raped the girl and everyone in town knew it, but essentially he was condemned from the moment after Mayella screamed. The ending, however, is sort of a happy one in spite of what happened to Tom.<br />Yet, not all people in town are racist rednecks. Harper Lee does not go into stereotype. Plenty of white people supported Tom Robinson, Atticus most of all. I met a woman who named her son after Atticus Finch, and after reading the book I can see why. He was my favorite character in the book because of his high-mindedness and fair sense of justice.<br />All in all a terrific piece of work, one that will make its readers think differently after they're done.
0887307396|5.0|This is a great business book.  It effectively and systematically goes through 18 visionary companies and discusses what all of these organizations have in common.  It additionally contrasts a peer for each of these companies (IE, Visionary - Ford; Peer - GM) and shows how each company is different in culture, management style and results.   <br />What the authors demonstrate is that all of the companies have some core philosophies - commitment to customer service; commitment to their employees; instillation of a company culture and mandatory adherence to it; and most importantly, a dream of where they wanted to end up (big hairy adacious goals [BHAG]).  The authors go though the birth of the companies (or the &quot;rebirth&quot; in some cases) to capture how they alligned themselves in pursuit of their dream.<br />This book is a usefull guide whether you are a sole proprietor of a small company, a manager at any level or a senior corporate officer.  It is highly readable and greatly lends itself to easy comprehension (no &quot;business &quot;e's&quot; spoken here).  If you are looking to get the most out of the organization you lead, this is a great place to start.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Its a while since a record like OK Computer was made. A record that fits together, combining a dozen songs to paint a single (but very intricate) picture. The theme throughout is the state of the earth in the information age, and feeling detached from it and alienated. It questions whether machines have helped or hindered people and combines deep, multi-layered lyrics with some of the most innovative music ever.<br />The feeling of the album is so strong that the concept comes through in the music as well as the lyrics. Here are the 3 best individual songs (although to be fully appreciated the record has to be heard as a whole):<br />Paranoid Android - The epic song on the album, with 3 very different sections. Good tunes, musical inventiveness and brilliant lyrics.<br />Karma Police - Simple, acoustic song with some spine-chilling moments and a wonderful togetherness that is hard to place.<br />Lucky - A huge, sweeping sound, fantastic guitar and a brilliant tune.<br />This record is best appreciated in a corner with a discman and the lyrics. It can reduce grown men to tears. Essential.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I was getting a little worried this year that no album would come along to snag my personal favorite album of the year spot, but THIS is IT!  John Mayer writes and performs catchy, warm, inviting music.  He is a talent.  It is just a matter of weeks, I'm sure, before most of the major radio stations in the country jump on the John Mayer bandwagon.  (I usually find it helpful in these reviews when the reviewers list their other favorite musical artists, so here are mine:  James Taylor, Shawn Colvin, Crowded House, Top 40 from the 1970s.)
B00005RFAI|5.0|MISSUNDAZSTOOD moves Pink to a more personal sound, a sound that suites her. With her debut CANT TAKE ME HOME, she was doing the R&amp;B thing, which was really popular at the time, she did a good job, but this CD is truly Pink. The CD is intensely personal, dealing with personal issues. She is misunderstood, and this is a result of the misconceptions there are out there about Pink. Overall though it is a better album than CANT TAKE ME HOME, its well rounded, an album you can listen to start to finish without skipping any tracks. Highlights include &quot;My Vietnam&quot;, &quot;Family Portrait&quot;, &quot;Lonely Girl&quot;, &quot;18 Wheeler&quot; and more. Overall a really good album, she put herself in this one and put a lot of effort into it, it pays off and shows. One of the year's best.
B00005LW3J|5.0|I will certainly be looking for more Kei Mizutani movies after the box set. Good bang for the buck.
B000021YQV|5.0|This CD is awesome. Every track is killer. You can listen to this CD over continously a thousand times. System of a Down rules. The Cd has great songs like Chop Suey, Prison Song, and Toxicity. This is a great CD to add to you're collection. If you don't have this buy it now.
B00003CY3W|5.0|I enjoyed this film a great deal.  The characters were well conceived, and the actors gave them a real depth.  Parts were exceptionally poignant, and other moments were riotously funny.  The momentum of the plot reminded me of a Greek tragedy...(...).
B00005NWM3|5.0|This is a really good CD. Every track is excellent. This is a CD that you can just listen to over and over again. It mixes between alternative and Rock. Nickelback is a really good band and so is this CD. I'm sure you've heard track 2 &quot;How you remind me&quot; on the radio cause I know they play a lot down here. This CD is a good addition to your collection and a must get.
B00005QDW1|5.0|(...) The cd actually has every song made with specific choruses and versus. So please do not download this cd, buy it, beacause it is very hard to find the real full songs on the internet. P.S. every single song is good on this album...maybe \\"start the fire\\" is sometimes skipable....but my favs are......hella good (their next single acording to their performance on saturday night live), don't let me down (the rock song that sounds like its from some teen movie)in my head (a classic no dount beat) and running (the best ballad in the world)...SPEND THE MOENY...IT'S WORTH IT
B00003CXZ3|5.0|Memento is by far the best movie I have seen by a notable degree. The director is a genius, and while the pessimist will say that it would be impossible for him to top this work, I'll leave it at: it'll be an incredible endevor. This movie kept me interested and thinking the entire time and I have subsequently had longer conversations about this film than the actual film itself. While the plot line takes you into the mind of the main character who suffers from a short term memory span of 5 minutes, the filming parallels this theme by working backwards in 5 minute sections. This is just one of the underlaying intricacies that makes memento the masterpiece it is. The unique flow of the film (contrary to the very few bad reviews I have read)adds an amazing characteristic and insight to the characters. You can start memento at any point in the film and as long as you watch every frame, it will still make complete sense. I would recommend this film to anyone with a brain and the will to be intrigued.
B00004Z459|5.0|Because this is a stellar album. I admit, when this band came out, I was very weary about the purchase of this CD. Everyone said &quot;Just another rap-metal band&quot; and &quot;Limp Bizkit wanna-bes,&quot; well, I'll be the one to tell you, this is not the case. I have yet to regret the day I bought this CD. It refuses to leave my CD player, even a year later, I am still listening to it almost everyday. Linkin Park's music is very infectious, and anyone who tells you they don't like at least one of their songs is lying to you. This, my friends, is not just another Limp Town 55 rap-metal band. The word &quot;Yo&quot; is not uttered once on this entire album, and not only that, all the songs are completey devoid of cussing all together. Which just proves that you can get your point across without trying to act all tough by swearing. The combination of the music styles on here is very well executed. It reminds me of Incubus' &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; in the fact that there is simply nothing out there like it. Dj Hahn plays an intricate part in the band. Most DJ's in nu-metal bands these days have no purpose at all, but the atmosphere and texture on this album can be credited to Joe Hahn himself, he even gets his own song, &quot;Cure For the Itch&quot; (I Would be very interested in some solo stuff from him). The dual singer style is used very well, and sometimes Mike and Chester blend together so well, that you can't tell who's who. Chester's vocals are great and his lyrics are very thoughtful and have more relevance to life in general than any other writer in a rap-rock band. Mike Shinoda's rapping is flawless and doesn't sound cheesy or faked. He actually has an extensive background in hip-hop and that is the kind of music he knows best, which is the best part about Linkin Park. Everyone in the band has their own style and it all blends together so well, it is impossible to hate this album. Metal purists will hate it because there are no guitar solos or some greasy dude with a mullet, but those with an open mind have an album to enjoy.y dude with a mullet, but those with an open mind have an album to enjoy.
6303011012|5.0|This concert from evening of September 23, 1993, must have been a wonderful event to have experienced...the VHS of it is a polished gem that will never go out of style. The professionalism and musicianship is outstanding, and the setting is magical...with 2000 year old arches surrounding the open air stage, and the amazing structures of ancient Greece lit up against the night sky.<br />Shardad Rohani conducts the London Royal Pholharmonic Concert Orchestra, as well as doing a terrific violin duet with Karen Briggs, the super violinist member of Yanni's fabulous group. Her solos are a knock-out, as well as those of the rest of the band, among them Charlie Adams on drums, Ric Fierabracci on bass, and Michael &quot;Kalani&quot; Bruno on percussion.<br />Yanni looks stunning and plays beautifully on a grand piano, as well as an assortment of keyboards...you can tell he is also leading the entire show...and it's quite a show.<br />There's a touching song he sings for his mother Felitsa, who sits in the audience, next to the gorgeous Linda Evans, both of them glowing with pride.<br />Directed by George Veras with 14 cameras, the editing is a marvel, a constant flow images that keeps one's interest and works to perfection with the music...the concert is an hour and 35 minutes long, with an added 5 minutes of backstage interviews.<br />This is one to take out of your tape library once in a while, and wish you'd been there, on this very special night under the Grecian stars.
B00005JKQX|2.0|Despite the fact that the acting and makeup in this movie were well done, A Beautiful Mind suffers from Hollywood syndrome. Ron Howard's directing has never impressed me, and this movie is no exception. Generic classical techniques flood this film, and even when the camera is doing something interesting, there is more of an emphasis on &quot;money shots&quot; than anything else. If anything the plot was coherent and possessed a few points that were somewhat clever, but that does not help the unoriginality of this film. Like Men of Honor, this is a typical overdramatic biography film that suffers from exaggerated dialogue, stale camerawork, and as always a predictable score, chock full of soaring violins and oodles of crecendo. Once again the acting was not bad, but it still suffered from the melodramatic plague that has infected nearly every Holloywood blockbuster in the past decade. The pacing of this movie also suffered greatly, for it either moved way too slowly or too awkwardly. At times some scenes seemed thrown together or piled on. Bluntly put, this film just did not interest me. It was not realistic enough to come across as a biography (due to the score, acting, and dialogue), not paced well enough to make a great deal of sense, excruciatingly long and painful to watch, and not compelling enough in regards to both the plot and the esthetics. If you must see this film, wait until it is released on video and rent it. This could pass as Oscar material, but only because Mr. Howard has pulled every old trick out of the proverbial book. Save your money and your 2 hours.
6305080445|2.0|&quot;Robert Redford...got snookered badly&quot; in this movie?  What about Debra Winger?  She is too good for this film, and the behind-the-scenes friction between her and Redford are only noticeable on-screen because of him.  As usual, Debra's a pro. The movie is totally mediocre, though, even for a light-weight comedy.  And what's up with Daryl Hannah?  I was only a kid back in the 80's, so I don't remember.  Was that woman actually taken seriously?<br />Anyhow, if you're a serious fan of any of the actors involved, you may enjoy this.  Otherwise, don't do it.
B00005R2BG|5.0|Moulin Rouge is an awesome movie!  Well I like all types of movies so if you can get into almost anything i'm sure you'll like this.  It's kind of like Romeo and Juliet but with music!  The beginning of the movie is kinda tense (like it's really fast and u can't really get the point) but then once they start dancing and Christian meets Satine everything starts to unfold.  The music is great, especially the song Hindi Sad Diamonds (Chamma Chamma)!  It's a great movie and it's worth buying!
B00000JMOJ|3.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the &quot;running man&quot; which (if you've seen the movie know it's a game show.) I really did enjoy this movie.  I have seen Arnold Schwarzenegger in better roles, but the action is really good and it's a movie I love to watch again from time to time.  If you haven't seen it, GO FOR IT. I believe you will like it, if not love it.
B00004R99M|5.0|Mary Poppins is one of those classic and magical movies that will never go out of style. Each time I watch it, it gets better and I see something new in the film. Julie Andrews is perfectly cast as the \\"practically perfect\\" nanny for the two Banks children in her very first movie (She won an Oscar for Best Actress for her portrayal of Mary Poppins in 1964). Dick Van Dyke is absolutely wonderful as the comical and charming Bert, one of the best roles he would ever portray on screen. Backed by an amazing supporting cast including Ed Wynn (he loves to laugh!), Glynis Johns as Mrs. Banks, David Tomlinson as the domineering and punctual Mr. Banks, and Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber as the adorable Banks children Jane and Michael. With amazing musical numbers and award winning songs and special effects this film is wonderful from start to finish with never a dull moment and something to offer for everyone. A truly magical film that once you have seen, you can never forget.  <BR>The DVD version of this timeless classic is a must have.  Complete with special segments on the making of the film, clips of the stars arriving at the premier, and games, it too has a little something for everyone.
B00005N9CV|5.0|After reading some of the your negative reviews, I felt I had to write a brief one myself. This CD is my first by Ms. Krall, having heard cuts from it on a local jazz station.<BR>I'm sorry some &quot;purists&quot; did not like The Look of Love!  I was BLOWN AWAY!  Yes, the arrangements are a bit lush, but I love that sort of thing.  And, of course, Ms. Krall's voice is absolutely wonderful!  This is fast becoming one of my favorites!
B00005NKK8|5.0|this has some of the best songs ever on it. all of you should buy this damn CD. it is worth every damn penny!
0684803356|5.0|This book is about an American, Robert Jordan, who joins the Republican Army (communists) to fight the nationalists during the civil war in Spain in the 1930s. He joins a guerilla-group which is given the mission to blow up a bridge to obstruct the fascists offensive. Although he has a bad feeling about the whole situation he persists. <BR>I found the character pilar the most interesting, fulfilling a key role of telling the background story (her experience in the war sofar) as well as being the one who keeps the whole group together (her insights give the American, Robert Jordan, some information about Pablo, the member of the group who cant be trusted). <BR>Although it has bothered a lot of people (read the other reviews), for me the translated Spanish words and little sentences really added something to the atmosphere of the book as well as to a better depiction of the characters.
B00005QZWI|5.0|This score really grows on you. If a soundtrack can move me and bring tears to my eyes, then I know it's worth it--and this one did just that! Track 2 &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; is a worthy motif. Track 13: &quot;The Bridge Of Khazad Dum&quot; contains a beautiful choral theme when Gandalf falls. Tracks 17: &quot;The Breaking Of The Fellowship&quot; and 18: &quot;May It Be [composed &amp; performed by Enya]&quot; are well worth the purchase of the CD. Enya's voice is haunting and beautiful. This is a worthy score of a cinematic masterpiece.
B00005U11Z|5.0|Hold on a minute while I catch my breath!  This is a fantastic DVD.  The video is crystal clear and the sound is awesome.  Forget VHS, get the DVD.  Youll wear out the tape format playing it over and over.  Journey fans have long deserved a decent live video.  Now they have it.  The band sounds better than ever.  Journey definitely gets better with age!  Deen is a wildman on the drums.  Neal effortlessly scorches the guitar.  Steve Augeri stakes his claim as THE frontman for the most talented rock and roll band in the galaxy.  Jonathan is great as usual and Ross looks as relaxed and focused as ever.  Every time I watch it, I feel as though Im standing upfront with everyone else.  It will definitely keep me going until the 2002 tour.  THANK YOU JOURNEY!&quot;Can I get a DONT STOP!&quot;
B000006OBQ|5.0|If you love Frank like I love Frank, then you will LOVE this CD set live in 50's vegas.
B000002UAO|5.0|The most captivating thing about this album is that it lies on the line between early Beatles albums with their catchy pop (such as A Hard Day's Night) and the later, more far-out albums (such as the White Album). Rubber Soul manages to create a perfect balance between the two, with songs that manage to sound fresh without sounding filler-ish, but also manage to sound slightly more dreamy and spaced than the Fabs' earlier efforts. 'Drive My Car' and 'Run For Your Life' are perfect Beatles rockers and Lennon shines with 'In My Life' and 'Girl'. I don't think this album gets the recognition it deserves - I'd take this over Revolver or Sgt Peppers any day!
B000002H33|5.0|Just enough fast, hard, intelligent, metal for anyone's taste. Well maybe not everyone, but anyone who appreciates really good metal. I must admit that I am not a fan of the &quot;New Stuff&quot; Metallica has done, but I do realize that it is good music either way. I just happen to like Metallica the way they were. Master of Puppets will keep you awake on a long road trip and will make any party a bit better if you cater to that kind of crowd. I think this is Metallica at their best. You will not be disappointed. GO NOW and get it!
B00005R87Q|5.0|I think it is a fast movie, and its taking you to the edge of your dreams and eyes,but only if you liked cars .<BR>The main stars in this films is acting very cool,most vin dielsel and paul walker try to give it to the edge.<BR>And of course a couple of hot (babes),but I mostly love the cars,I think it is the hottest in this movie,but I can recommend this movie to all that like A KICK ON THE EDGE.
B000002H2H|5.0|I have to say that this is one very nice metal album. I prefer Master of Puppets, but if this is all you have don't worry. It stands on its own in the world of metal. Metallica, sell-out or not, have undeniably put out some pretty damn good releases. Ride the Lightning being among the two best. I highly recommend picking this cd up and playing it very very loud. A nice look into the brilliant past of Metallica.
B00005KB9W|5.0|This is a great CD for any Marley fan to pick up. I think  most of these live joints are significantly better than the studio versions, especially the classic &quot;I Shot The Sheriff&quot; and &quot;Lively Up Yourself&quot; with its catchy bassline. But the crown jewel of the album is the live cut of &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot;. This track is the absolute greatest live version I have ever heard, of any song, ever. It blows the studio version out of the water, and is just an incredible tune. So slowed and chill, its depressing when the mood is right. Pick this album up you wont be disappointed.
B00003CXRM|5.0|You're never sure of what you'll get when you go to a Coen brothers flick. Well, maybe you are - you're going to get entertained. They do it again with O Brother. Only the Coens could mix Homer with Bluegrass and come up a with a winner.<br />The story is silly and fun and keeps a smile on your face. The music is a much needed cinematic nod to a unique American sound that has been lost to so many of us. The tunes fit the story perfectly and lift the movie to a level of pure enjoyment. Or was the story wrapped around the tunes? Hard to tell and doesn't really matter.<br />There are lots of moments in this film that will leave you chuckling long after you see it: The Siren scene; Clooney's rapid exit from a boxcar; the upside down bloodhound drifting by in the flood; the blind radio station owner (talk about great character actors); Delmar's joyous river baptism; and on and on and on.<br />It's worth noting that the Coens pay tribute here to the wonderful 1941 film &quot;Sullivan's Travels&quot; from which they unabashedly took their title. The ideas for a few scenes seem tie back to &quot;Sullivan&quot; as well, including the boxcar chase.<br />Finally, Tim Blake Nelson is incredible as the sweet half-wit Delmar. Clooney and Turturro seem like easy choices for the Brothers Coen, and both do great work here. But how on earth did they find Nelson? He nearly steals the movie. Sings a pretty mean rendition of &quot;In the Jail House Now&quot; to boot. Who knew?
6305949972|5.0|Who cares if he didn't direct it, it's still Burton's baby! I'm a huge fan of the little weirdo, and this is another one of his greats. Too bad he didn't get to direct it himself because he was shooting another favorite of mine, &quot;Batman Returns&quot;. Still, it can and will be counted as one of his films for one reason: It has his name written all over it (Especially in the full title). This was the first Burton movie that I actually paid attention to (With the possible exception of &quot;Pee Wee's Big Adventure&quot;). Now, in my teens, do I go back to the rest of them. I love all of Tim's movies (Even &quot;Mars Attacks&quot;) and this one is great because it's a musical. I've always loved Danny Elfman's themes and caracters actually sing in this one (Danny himself sings some of the characters). Delightful holiday fun!!
0316776963|4.0|A friend recommended this book to me, saying that it is &quot;hilarious&quot;. While I didn't find it rolling-on-the-floor funny, it does have its smile-inducing moments. Basically a series of personal essays about the author's life in North Carolina, New York, and ultimately France, it is filled with amusing bits that can be appreciated by the resident of a country town or an urban dweller.<br />I, for one, could really relate to his dislike of computers and his appreciation for the typewriter. His takes on our fascination with technology, youth, and intelligence are on the mark.<br />The book takes flight in part &quot;Deux&quot; where the humorist relates much about life in France. When he discusses the American couple mistaking him as a Parisian pickpocket, I couldn't stop laughing at these dim-witted &quot;ugly Americans.&quot; His revelation of French customs will be beneficial to anyone planning a trip to that much-visited country.<br />I thank my friend for this introduction. I will be reading more by this author.

0792846443|1.0|'Misery' is an appropriate title for another of MGM's terrible dvd tranfers. <br />Misery is an intelligent thriller starring a superb cast of actors and actresses in leading, as well as supporting roles. Ms. Bates certainly deserved the Oscar that was awarded to her for her performance as Annie Wilkes, the number one fan of Paul Sheldon, writer of the Misery novels that has become her whole world.<br />Without giving too much of the plot away and hailing this film as one of the all time best phychological thrillers on celluloid, MGM has disrespected ANOTHER movie in it's library. For starters, the STANDARD version is actually the WIDESCREEN version and visa versa. After you figure this out, you begin to watch a pretty good transfer that begin to make you doubt your vision. <br />This movie in several scenes actually 'shake'. By shake, I mean the movie begins to discretely vibrate in specific scenes, at first you think it's you, but when the same vibrations happen in other scenes further into the film, you know better. It's MGM again!!<br />What is with this studio and it's dvd titles? If the public pays good money to 'SEE' an excellent movie, why is it such a chore to give them their money's worth, and produce AT LEAST, a watchable product. <br />Shame on MGM for being so slack with the titles that they submit to the public for purchase. The disrespect that they show to their titles and to the buying public is outrageous!
B00003CXSP|4.0|I cant see why people are slagging off hannibal so much.OK so it is not going to be as good as the silence of the lambs,but it never could.There is still fun to be had in Anthony Hopkin's darkly comic performance and gary oldman gives a first rate performance as the twisted Mason Verger.The film is beautifully shot and Florence is an ideal Lecter hiding place (remember the line in silence of the lambs ..&quot; Do you know florence?&quot;)and the 2 disc set contains lots of features as well as a great transfer of audio and video.Don't take my word for it though,rent it first and decide for yourself.
0790725657|5.0|A truly great movie that I have watched over and over again, both with and without my own children.  What I liked most about just watching the movie was the way it blended visually rich scenes with charming and sometimes hauntingly beautiful music that literally sent shivers down my spine.  The cinematography was so carefully and skillfully done that at times one seemed to almost be transported back in time, into the movie itself.  What I wanted most to say about the movie is that it is a good one for children who have experienced the loss of a parent in their lives.  There is a scene where Sara seems to have lost almost everything, and has no one left in the world to care about her.  Then in the morning, the window blows open and she is inspired to dance in the falling snow, seeming to realize that life still is worth living.  To me that was one of the most powerful, moving, and uplifting scenes I think I've ever seen in a movie.
B00000ILDE|5.0|What can you say about aliens apart from what most people already know...SCI FI/ACTION CLASSIC...We all know the story,and the disc is the extended cut which adds to the story even more.The only downside is the pictures quality wavers between good and then grainy for some reason.Also extras are quality.<BR>(this refers to the British region 2 version)

1559408898|5.0|I imported this dvd and was overjoyed too find it was region free so could be played on any ntsc compatible player over here like so many of the older titles on this site(you Americans have certainley got your dvds sorted god bless you)and it was also the uncut ultra-brutal version.Allthough It was only slightly more violent than the British release It was still great to have the more complete version.There is not a lot too say as far as i am concerned Paul Verhoven's Robocop is a sci-fi classic.Slick,fast,great effects and spectacular action when it starts but also a moral underlying in the spoof &quot;tv broadcasts of the future&quot; are clearly making fun of the state of todays society.Perhaps we could do with a few Robocops on the streets today to sort out the idiots!The only slight flaw is the disc is only in dolby surround and not dolby digital 5.1,and the picture good and clear as it is,is non-anamorphic.Too add too insult I read recently that the directors cut as mentioned above is being released in Britain now with deleted scenes and probably anamorphic with 5.1 audio knowing my luck.And i am too poor to buy it again.
052594527X|5.0|This should be considered a classic. It gives insight into the desires and disappointments we all have to face in our life.  Even one innocent choice can lead to disaster and unhappiness for ourself and others, who may be unaware of our choice.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Three words for this movie...I HATED IT!!!  I bought this movie without seeing it cause my friend said I would LOVE it...so I took his advise.  BIG MISTAKE....I couldn't even sit through the first 30 mins.  I would have walked out of the theater had I seen it while it was there.  Now my biggest problem is how to get rid of this aweful DVD and replace it with something I'll enjoy
0140177396|5.0|An outstanding, chilling, and thought provoking book that helped to shape my thought processes as an adolescent when I read the book for the first time, Of Mice and Men is Steinbeck's most succinct piece. A delicacy I enjoyed again this past summer, its messages change, its characters evolve, and its definitions are redefined with a readers age and experience.<br />Regardless, this book is a classic and a staple for any fan of literature.
0060934913|5.0|As someone who has worked front-of-house in various establishments, i have encountered my fair share of chefs, from the humble drones to those who think they are higher than God. I have to say, that based on my experience, Bourdain's writing rings true. <br />His writing is a little over the top, a bit 'put-on' hyper-kinetic in places. But he expresses the vibe of a kitchen on a Friday night perfectly - it IS over the top and hyper-kinetic. Bourdain comes across as the kind of guy you would love to have a drink with but hate to work under - typical of most chefs.<br />Best of all, his writing rings true - he is not afraid to list his failures, not afraid to admit when he is wrong (his chapter on Scott Bryan, his opposite in the world of chefdom, is a whole essay on 'forget what I said previously') but also not full of false modesty - he gives himself credit where it is due. <br />Some people may read this book and think it is a revelation - the whole don't order brunch, or fish on a Tuesday. I just saw it for a matter of fact collection of essays on what restaurants really are - not the food channel, not food porn, not Delia Smith Jamie Oliver paradises but charnel houses and sweat-shops - the types that when they are at their worst make you cry, and at their best make you feel that you are working in the grooviest place in town.
B00005NWM3|4.0|I first heard the track &quot;how you remind me&quot; on a weird little thing on the internet and then I heard it on the Karrang channel. It's so good and I think they are going to be really big in the new year. By the way merry christmas everyone!!
B00005QW5X|5.0|Hewdwig and the Angry Inch is the most purest and inventive creations to come out of one vision since the hayday of the musical.  Hewdig should not be missed by anyone who has ever dreamed or has any kind of emotions.  The story is simple a sad life plays out through song but its the pure drama and ambition of John Cameron Mitchell as the erotic hedwig and his traveling minions that give Hedwig it's Wizard of Oz grandiose! The scecne of a love struck Hedwig being led to a moment of passion by her lover only to be crushed when he finds the true her is amazing! Clothes and a broken pathway guide the scene as they make their way to an open door to tears and heartache.  Another key element is the songs-well crafted and genius flooding with true emtion teh songs hav eto be purchased as the soundtrack! The melody alone could give the Beatles a run for their money.  Hedwig needs to be enjoyed by anyone with a heart I hope you love it!
B00005U11Z|5.0|Realmente perfecta la elaboracion de este DVD, la calidad de sonido y la imagen son extraordinarios, la interpretacion de las canciones son excelentes. Sabia lo buen gitarrista que es Neal Schon pero despues de verlo aqui quede mas impresionado de lo que pensaba, el nuevo baterista es super energico, pero lo mas impresionante de este DVD es el vocalista Steve Augeri, el es el perfecto clon vocal de Perry, si estan dudando adquirir este DVD solamente porque no esta Perry, estan equivocados, Augeri es el hombre perfecto para el grupo. Una muy buena adquisicion.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|When I first caught Moulin Rouge in the theatre I was not impressd! The problem was the film felt claustrophobic; In Luhrman's Paris everything was so close chararcter's and key scenes seemed stiff. Amazingly in home viewing the clasutrophobic feeling WORKS! Long gone is the small world feeling its been replaced with a feeling of intimacy with the viewer.  Moulin Rouge at home turns into an affair between two lovestruck misguided fools finding their way with you a riend along for the ride!  Moulin Rouge is a musical that uses modern songs set to a 19th century Paris.  This gives the viewer a sense of comfort and appreciation.  To Luhrman's mistake he seems to reuse the same gimmick over and over again- this being fast editing. At times the camera moves so fast you have no clue where to foucus your attention.  This film is not a masterpiece but it is a work of pure love and it come through for the viewer.  Kidman and McGregor deserve Oscar nominations for their performances here-not the best acting but the most courage to tackle such demanding roles. I have to say the last 40 or so minutes of the film are awe-inspiring.  The costumes and dark atmosphere hold more tension and depth than most traditional films could garner.  Moulin Rouge plays like a comical fable with one of the most dramatic endings ever placed on celluloid.  Kidman's porcelin face and sweat ridden features have more to do with love then any melody that pours out from the disc.
B00005RIKD|4.0|You really do have to give Sting credit. At a time when most artists of his ummm... ( not so young ) age bracket are doing golden oldie tours and state fairs, here is Sting still selling out concert halls and releasing discs that are still able to find their way to platinum. Go figure! Well, Sting is nothing else if not resiliant so releasing another 'live' cd was probably a justifiable, well thought out ( although hopefully not calculated ) idea. And....that may be the sole reason I didn't give this disc 5 stars either! <br />I had previously read of the release of this cd before it's Nov. due date and was a little apprehensive. Apparently Sting was able to not only choose the setting of the concert ( which I have no problem with ) but, much to my dismay, was even afforded the luxury of \\" hand-picking \\" his audience for the show as well. Needless to say, upon hearing this news flash, my internal alarms were jumping off the scale! Here I thought, once again, was an artist who was willing to sacrifice any type of ' musical spontinenty ' so he could completely control his enviroment and put out a product that lacked any rough edges or any real musical 'integrity ' i.e. improvisations, solos, etc. Was Sting trying to have his cake and eat it too? Only time and a open-minded, honest listen to \\" ...All This Time \\" would tell. So.....<br />That being the case, after having given \\"... All This Time \\" a few 'spins' I must admit that, for the most part, it is actually quite well-done. Granted, in a setting where the audience is mostly young, white, well-dressed and politely appreciative of Sting and bandmates there really was no risk of anything going askew. It does, regrettably, feel as if Sting was playing for some type of Martha Stewart dinner party for the ' cheese and wine ' set. There's a certain sense of elitism and that's not particularly to my liking but....so be it. Which brings us to the music. And fortunately that is where Sting does get it right! For the most part he doesn't necessarily ' reinvent ' these songs as much as he just ' shapes' them just slightly. Everything is given a smooth-jazz, slightly intimate type of work-out that for the most part seems to actually work! \\" Moon Over Bourbon Street \\" is nice and jazzy, \\" Dienda \\" a new song, written with Kenny Kirkland, was interesting and had an unusual scale that wasn't formulaic. Plus, \\" Hounds Of Winter \\" was very well-done and may be my own personal highlight also. Add to the mix \\" Perfect Love Gone Wrong \\" which, for me, was worth the price of the disc in itself! \\" Roxanne \\" unfortunately, was not done to my liking since he tried to make it fit in with the other selections, most of them again being performed with a lounge, white wine, jazzy style feel to them. The song should always be performed in the stripped-down, Raggae tinged style in which it was originally recorded. And, for my part, if I never hear \\" Every Breath You Take \\" again that would be fine too. Altogether though, a job very well done and I'm happy with my purchase. I only wish he would have let the band ' stretch ' out a little more on this disc. And watching them on the broadcast they look as if they may agree! <br />Overall, I would probably recommend this disc to anyone who enjoys music that, while not exactly groundbreaking or even musically exciting, is still pleasant and makes for a comfortable evening. Sting, along with his audience, is simply getting on in years and while we may miss the younger, more adventurous artist we, at least, have Sting maturing into a nice MOR style of crowd pleaser. I'm just not certain if that is good.....or bad. Now, has anyone seen my corkscrew?
B00005QZWI|3.0|I was never a Shore fan but I expected a lot from this score since the movie allows the composer to act freely and create an amazing score containing action, magic and fantasy. But Shore's score lacks of all. Only the choral passages are worth listening but they are so short and all the same. The score doesn't have a good theme which is really bad for this kind of movie since the trilogy should have a really memorizable theme like Starwars or Indiana Jones or Back to the Future. Unfortunately this score is a good try but no success. But since the movie isn't a masterpiece, the score is enough for the movie.
B00000I7LJ|5.0|If you're a casual Natalie fan or are just getting into her music, stick with the original Tigerlily.  If you are a huge fan of the woman with one of the most beautiful voices in popular music today, get this!  In my opinion, Tigerlily is Natalie's weakest album (I love Ophelia and Motherland equally) but it's still an amazing piece of work and the bonus songs are a great addition to this great album!  The original version of Tigerlily rates a 4 out of 5 but this special bonus edition rates a perfect 5.
0452282152|3.0|One half of me liked this book, I enjoyed reading about his paintings and the time in which they were painted.<br />The other half was waiting and hoping for something to happen between Vermeer and the maid- it was totally left off-  like<br />&quot;what was that&quot; - I agree with one of the comments made earlier,<br />I would recommend this to a young girl- she would enjoy it.<br />Disappointed from ALL the hype!!
B00005JKQX|5.0|...what this film was going to be about.  I had no idea who John Nash was and I had no idea this was based on a true story.  I would have to admit, I was very surprised by Russell Crowe's performance.  I thought he was OK in &quot;Gladiator&quot;, and have not seen him in anything else since then, so when I saw him in this movie, I was utterly amazed.  He played this character flawlessly, to the point that I believed he was John Nash.  I don't know of very many actors who can make you believe they're someone else and not who they really are.  The scripwriter also should be commended, because if it weren't for those wonderful quirky phrases that he gives Crowe in the movie, you would not get a good sense of the character at all.  Although Crowe is a bit hard to understand (he mumbles alot in the movie), when you catch one of those phrases, it just brings a whole different light to the character.<br />Even though the movie seems to cram a great deal into a film that is 2 1/2 hours long (well, almost 2 1/2 hours), I don't really see how a film can be made about most of a person's life without feeling rushed or crammed.  I don't think very many people would be willing to deal with a &quot;Ghandi&quot; length film--although longer movies seem to be more accepted these days than they were in the past, I still don't think a 4 hour movie would be to most people's taste.  One thing I should note, though, is that it sure didn't FEEL like a 2 1/2 hour movie.  I think the movie did a good job in highlighting the important parts of Nash's life, although I am sure others will differ.  One thing that bothered me throughout the movie was the fact that Nash rarely seems to be shown working or publishing after being diagnosed with schizophrenia, but I assume the reason why this was dropped was to emphasize what was going on in the last part of the movie (Nash trying to reclaim his life) rather than having us deal also with the mediocre details of what he published when.  It's prettymuch a given that Nash must have published some very influential papers, or else he never could have won the Nobel Prize.<br />I didn't find this movie mushy at all, however, I am female, and I guess it's a given for my gender that I find that things that are mushy for men are not mushy for me.  I just thought this was a powerful tale about a brilliant man who is faced with a devastating mental disorder who finds a way to balance his life and his work against dealing with such a devastationg disorder.  It's pretty clear that Nash is not one of the schizophrenics that can be &quot;cured&quot; with drugs, yet he found a very creative solution to deal with his problem.  I left the theater feeling admiration for a person I've never met and never will--I was absolutely terrible at math in high school and college.  On a more personal level, since I have been diagnosed with clinical depression, I feel inspired by this movie to find a way around my problem like Nash did and try to conquer my problem with a creative solution instead of just giving up when the drugs don't work out.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I got this album on a whim. It was so good I have recommended it to all my rock friendly friends. This year has been really disappointing musically speaking. It's nice to have a refreshing garage rock sound.<br />_hope you enjoy it too!
0790729393|5.0|Very well put movie . Made me want to cry for the 4 boys and what happened to them in that wilkinson home for boys . As much as I love Kevin Bacon this movie sure made me want to hate him for what he did to the boys . Brad Pitt was brilliant in how he got back at all the guards  for what they had done . This is a 5 STAR movie if I ever saw one .
B00004STPT|5.0|Hans Zimmer has created a score to last a millenium.  From the   energetic &quot;The Battle&quot; and &quot;The Barbarian Horde&quot; to the eerily emotional &quot;Am I Not Merciful?&quot;, the score serves as a perfect underpinning to the movie, but it also stands on its own as an absolutely stunning composition.  Enjoy it now, and enjoy it later, because this score is going to endure.  Zimmer has raised the bar for all other film music composers.
B000000H7I|4.0|&quot;Effigy of the Forgotten&quot; is a hard-hitting, technically precise album that those who are still new to to death metal (as I am) can enjoy pretty easily.  The songs here are unquestionably brutal, with extremely tight and guttural growls backed up by crushing riffs and drums, occasionally augmented by a whipping guitar solo.  Although, as I alluded in my title, this album can get a repetitive in that all the songs are rather similar, there are just enough instrumental wrinkles and tempo shifts to keep things from getting boring.  So if you like death metal that's technically tight but not overly complex, you can't go wrong with &quot;Effigy.&quot;
B000002UDB|5.0|From 1965-1970, the Beatles released seven albums and unprecendented experiences. I have always felt that fittingly enough, their albums progressed with their lives in perfect sequence. Listen to Rubber Soul and Revolver back to back, and you get the Fabs growing from Mop Tops and standard rock n' roll progressions into folk, early psychedlia, and deeper lyrics. The White Album was essentially two albums in one, and its diversity perfectly reflected the different directions all four members were eventually headed for. Let It Be and Abbey Road served as the final chapters in the Beatles story, with the first one's uneven efforts mirroring the disheartened attitudes of all four members, and the last one brilliantly displaying how high the Beatles could soar when they stopped bickering. So where does Magical Mystery Tour stand? It should, of course, be listened to as another part of Sgt. Pepper. However, the album title was linked to the maligned movie of the same name, so it was categorically written off as simply a collection of singles. I know the idea of a Beatles album being &quot;written off&quot; sounds crazy (considering the praise and money they still earn today, some 31 years after they split), but people generally view Pepper as by itself in its writing and subject matter. However, the songs here are top notch, and the closing anthem &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; wraps up the wistful dream that Sgt. Pepper began. If you don't have this album in your collection, go out and give it a listen.
B00000BKDW|5.0|Some people prefer &quot;7th Son&quot; and &quot;Number Of The Beast&quot; but not me. This was Maiden's &quot;evolution&quot; if you will. Several of the songs like &quot;Aces High&quot; and &quot;2 Minutes To Midnight&quot; would have perfectly fit on &quot;Number Of The Beast&quot;, but &quot;Rime Of The Ancient Mariner&quot; shows hints of what's to come. Several songs on &quot;Somewhere In Time&quot; sound a little more like earlier stuff, though. The only difference between &quot;Rime...&quot; and &quot;7th son&quot; is that there are no synthesizers on this. This is classic Maiden. If you are new to Maiden, this has to be your introductory album, no ifs, ands or buts. I think I already explained why above. If you like the harder rocking songs more, try the earlier stuff. If you prefer the epic songs, go for the later stuff. UP_THE_IRONS!
B00005QDW1|5.0|Wow I thought that is was ggrrreeat (in the words of Tony the tiger). I was listening to people talk or rather complain about this CD being so different blah blah blah and I said stop your bloody whining. You do not know No Doubt like I do (geeze that is cheesy). A little history on my love of the No Doubt: I began listening to No Doubt back in the 4th grade(thanks to my Southern California roots) I am now graduated that is half of my life (me being almost 18 and all). I have loved them since. Anyway I was listening to people complain about this lovely C of D an I was thinking if you were real NxD fans you would know that this CD sound as different as all of the CDs from the self-titled to the Underrated Return Of Saturn and now this one. I can shake my Booty to this and that is a good sign. They are growing...do not let them hit a glass ceiling. They can do no wrong in my eyes and I dub them true masters of change. So what if MTV plays 'em when that is done...I will still be around will you?
B00005NGZX|5.0|I had been a fan of Converge since the release of When Forever Comes Crashing, finding plenty to love in the insanity they created there. I have been awaiting this album for some time, and it is definitely worth the wait. Taking everything they excelled with from their past releases, Converge grow upon it, using better production to their advantage. This is one dark beast of an album, the lyrics and vocals combining with the phenomenal guitar and drum work to beat your mind into a muck, leaving you wide eyed when the final track comes to a close. The few soft spots serve as a reprieve from the overall nastiness elsewhere, which even makes its way into the somewhat unsettling liner art. Worthy of all the hype and praise circling it. <br />Best tracks: opener Concubine, Distance and Meaning, Hell To Pay.
0195073401|5.0|To AL SNOW: Please read Milton Friedman &quot;The Methodology of Positive Economics&quot;--that should clarify for you the issues concerning unrealism of assumptions, and Gary Becker &quot;The Economic Approach to Human Behavior&quot;--that should clarify for you the relevance of economics for understanding the real world. By the way, there is not a single equation in either of the articles, don't worry!<br />As for MWG, I think the book is excellent. It is correct that the book is quite technical but hey, if you have come up to the point where you want to study advanced microeconomics, you should be afraid of anything but mathematics. So if you find reading the books difficult, my advice is learn first the necessary math (Jehle and Reny provides a good review) and then read MWG because you will learn a lot once you are able to handle the technical stuff. For instance, the section on general equilibrium is truly superb!
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is great movie as i read homers books in school and i caught on quickly. But if you have ever had troubles in your life this movie makes you laugh because you can relate. from the beginning this movie is hilarious. i had directv and order the all day tickets so i could watch it over and over and over again... great sound track and again this movie is just hilarious.
0913022101|4.0|this is an interesting book, very intruiging. How could man of his stature, possibly create so much suffering and annihilation of other races. Hitler is not somthing to look up to, hes a digusting, demented, twisted person. but to think that someone could have so much power that he tried to riegn over the whole world........is baffling. im not quite done with this book, but its good. i must say, its rather disgusting though how many people look up to this guy. but its a good read if u want to try to understand him and his motives.
B000002URV|5.0|Enigma is an revolutionary band.  They have combined dance music with well....praying.  Dont get me wrong this is not a pure religours group.  The music and voices are very relaxing and beutiful.  Some songs are danceable.
B000002HHB|5.0|I used to only like this album for a few tracks (Wonder, Carnival &amp; Jealousy) but it has grown and grown on me.  I think she has a wonderful voice and the production is excellent as it frames the (sometimes) sparse arrangements beautifully.  If you have a good hifi then you are for a treat with Tigerlily as it allows the melodies and timing to shine through (although I also listen to it in the car).<br />Of all her albums and of anything she did with the 10,000 Maniacs I would say this is the most emotional and consistently beautiful; it may take a little time to get under your skin - once it does though, you're hooked.  <br />Tigerlily should be in everyone's CD collection.
0453005071|4.0|I have only read the stories The Long Walk and Rage and just started Roadwork. The Long Walk is my favorite Stephen King book of all times.  I have read many of Stephen Kings books, but this one really makes you feel like you are there and can feel what each of the characters.  There are 100 choosen boys to walk a marathon until they can walk no longer.  This is a marathon unlike any others where if they fall below 4mph, they get three warning and after 3 warnings, they get their ticket, which is death.  The winner is the last one standing.  Through this walk you feel the characters tiredness and their minds slowly wandering until some cannot take much more.  The book keeps you reading until the suprising ending.<BR>I had heard that Rage was a great story but was banned.  To be honest, I was curious to why it would be banned and I wanted to see what the story was all about.  It starts out with a boy in high school who walks into school one day and kills a couple teachers and takes his math class hostage.  I thought it was an interesting story, but I didn't feel like I really knew the main character as I have in Kings other books.  I also thought that the ending wasn't something that would really happen, I know that if I was held hostage and watched my teacher get killed in front of me, I wouldn't have acted like most of the students in the class did.  Overall, I didn't think it was his best, but was interesting and kept me wanting to read it to the end.
B00005QIPH|3.0|Ok, I do admit that The Stokes have been hyped up a lot. But it is for good reason.  Although still fairly immature in their sound, the Strokes show a decent level of talent.  Some people have gone as far to call them the next Beatles. In my eyes that's an exaggeration.  The Beatles changed the world.  I don't think that will happen with the Strokes.  What this album offers the listener is a chance to escape from typical pop-music sound.
079074404X|5.0|If you are interested in golems see my review of the CD of the soundtrack of this movie, made in accordance with Norbert Wiener's patent.
B00005NB8K|5.0|Although Kilmers fantastic portrayal of singer, Jim Morrison, was outstanding, it wasn't true.  Jim was not always a drunken, stoned idiot all the time.  He was a smart, intelligent poet.  But beside the fact, the movie was excellent, one of my favorite.  This Special Edition comes with a second DVD that has interviews, documentaries, and more.  It is really excellent.  If you love The Doors music, then see this.  This is stunning.
B00005QK3W|5.0|I just got this Cd as an early Christmas present, and although I'd been looking forward to getting it, I was surprised about it's freshness.  I had already heard the first two tracks (Lonely Road, and From a Lover to a Friend), and absolutely loved them.  Through the whole CD I'm amazed with McCartney's ability to still sound fresh; on tracks like She's given up talking and About you he sounds genuinely current and modern, without sounding like an old guy who's trying to keep an audience. The track Heather seems to start out with an elevator music-like feel, but it turns into a beautiful piece with many different layers, and adorable lyrics.  McCartney actually only dives into his old sappy love song mode (which of course I always fall for!) for a few songs, one of them being I Do , which is one my fav tracks, and has that truly McCartney Love Song Trademark feel. <BR>  This is a truly fab album, probably his best in years, with much feeling and emotion.  Every song seems to have a special feeling for him.  This may come from taking as many years off as he did, and enduring what he did. I recommend this album for any McCartneyite, such as myself, or someone who got 1 and is interested in learning more.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Delicious deja vu.  I'd never miss anything Pink Floyd puts out. This was quite a treat.  I like the old with the new mixed together.  The whole feel is one smooth and hot ride at the same time.  Best of the BEST; that's ECHOES the compilation. If you've always been a fan its a NOT to miss...if you're just hearing PINK for the first time, enjoy.  This is the band that started it all. Enjoy.
B00005OM4Q|4.0|Recut and re-released films should be treated the same as remakes--one has to ask why it should be redone. Any number of films have benefited from this type of &quot;remake&quot;. Just as many, though, have had little added. In effect being able to go back and re-edit a film as allowed artistic second guessing. Sometimes it's to the disadvantage of a classic.<br />Crowe's &quot;bootleg&quot; version of Almost Famous (released under it's original title &quot;Untitled&quot;) kind of falls between these two camps as nothing essential is really added back to the film. A pity this wasn't released like this previously as the running commentary between Crowe and his Mom is actually interesting.<br />Still, kudos to Crowe (and the marketing folks at Dreamworks)for the way this package is put together. The CD of unreleased songs and having both versions of the film make this an interesting boxed set. A pity that Apocalypse Now Redux wasn't released in this format (there's a good example of a film that would benefit this type of packaging. It would have allowed the inclusion of the original film, the re-edited version --in the slightly different aspect ratio--along with the stunning documentary Hearts of Darkness by Coppola's wife).<br />SInce music is so essential to all of Crowe's films I can't help but wonder what he will do as a film director/writer once he finishes mining the past. What happens when he hits his midlife crisis? Who know what artistic explorations might be in store...
B000001FFJ|5.0|A sprawling, whacked-out effort, Rain Dogs is a bona-fide new Waits-ian masterpiece. His lyrics were by now highly idiosyncratic, and at times masterly. Waits spews forth his lunatic lyrics in a variety of equally apt and hilarious voicings over the top of his newly mastered horns and percussion-dominated arrangements. However, the standout songs seem to be to be the more reflective songs - ballads, if you will. Hang Down Your Head, Time, Downtown Train, and Blind Love are all excellent songs, some of the best that Waits has. But more atypical fare such as Gun Street Girl and Walking Spanish are just as good. A truly great album, Rain Dogs is a shining example of the purveying of perversity in greatness, rather than mere... diamonds &amp; gold.
0553573403|5.0|as anyone can guess from the multitude of other reviewers gushing with praise this is an absolutely amazing book, there is simply no other way to say it. i am an avid fantasy reader but was becoming disappointed with the genre after reading so many awful books with no imagination and the same plot superimposed with different characters. but martin's work brought back my thirst for great books.<br />this is no book with just some all powerful ruler or vilian who wants to either save or rule the world, instead it is a intricate weaving of characters. some people find the countless characters a daunting prospect, DON'T! martin's writing draws you in and after a few chapters you feel like you've known these people all your life.<br />i can't give a summary that would do justice to martin's work. the plot twists that yes, really are twists and completely unexpected, took my breath away. so many writers fall into the rutt of well the obvious next step is this or this, not martin. each turn leaves you breathless and wondering &quot;where did that come from?&quot;<br />one of the greatest things about martin's writing is his characters. there aren't any one dimensional characters here, no purely evil or simply good people appear in &quot;a game of thrones.&quot; you find yourself cheering for the bad guys almost as much as you are cheering for the helpless victim.<br />please, please give this book a whirl. anyone who can't find the joy in reading this book doesn't know good literature when it hits them in the head. give it a try. the next two books are out and don't follow the typical sequel slumps, if anything they are better!
B000050XEI|4.0|This is the 4th Enya CD I've bought.  They all sound similar, her style has not changed.  The music is pleasant, relaxing, and enjoyable.  If you liked the others, you'll like this one.  If you  are buying your first one, this is as good as any.
0525946284|5.0|Reading Ken Follett's 'Jackdaws' is like riding a wild roller coaster with unexpected turns, dips and twists.  Felicity Clairet, otherwise know as Flick, leads a rookie team of female agents into Nazi-occupied France just before D-Day to blow-up a critical target.  Her advesary in a relentless game of can &amp; mouse is Major Dieter Franck, a clever and cruel army detective.  Over a 10 day period the reader ducks, winces and twitches through intense suspense.  <br />Major Franck is a gem - a sadistic interrogator with an occasional conscience. His chapters are so intriguing, they tip the balance of reader interest early in the book.  However, when the Jackdaw team reaches France, Flick draws even with the major and novel accellerates.<br />Like all great roller coasters, you don't want it to end.  'Jackdaws' is a true thrill ride.  Buckle your seat belts and enjoy.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Is this Welles' greatest film? That's open to debate but it is a stunning debut that set a standard difficult to follow. At the ripe old age of 26 after a steady diet of theater, literature and performance Welles decided to turn his gaze on the one art form he really hadn't mastered. After watching John Ford's Stagecoach (and one can assume a number of Hitchcock films as well), Welles and his collaborators Herman J. Mankiewicz, cinematographer Gregg Toland and film editor Robert Wise created one of the enduring classics of American cinema.<br /><br />Edit: The Blu-ray edition of this film is exceptional and an improvement over the previously over processed DVD released a decade ago. Warner has done an exceptional job of restoring the film to Blu-ray providing fans with a sharp looking presentation with previously unnoticed detail (at least on home video) and a far more film-like presentation.<br /><br />Keep in mind that while Welles was in charge, Mank, Toland and Wise all played a substanial part in helping to create this classic film. All of this helps explain why Welles had a difficult time following up on Kane; he only worked with Toland and Wise once again and never with Mank. The Magnicient Ambersons is a near classic that fails primarily because of the botched version eventually released.<br /><br />This deluxe set has all the extras you could possibly ask for: the commentary tracks by Ebert and Bogdonovich are complimentary and quite different; the documentary is quite good at illuminating the infighting that went on in creating this film. This edition on Blu-ray includes \\"RKO 281\\" the docudrama about the making of the film from HBO.<br /><br />For those who appreciate Welles' film this is the ultimate edition.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00003CXAR|5.0|That famous line, uttered by a near-speechless Roy Scheider, was the talk of the summer of 1975.  I was only ten at the time, but was very much aware of &quot;Jaws-Mania.&quot;  My parents wouldn't let me see the film, yet that couldn't keep me from fantasizing about the carnage and thrills of a shark eating people.  When I did see it in a re-release in 1979, I was amazed that it surpassed my expectations.  The film is a well-crafted suspense tale, directed by a green Spielberg with confidence and aplomb (in my opinion, Spielberg permanently lost it with and after &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;).  Owing much to Melville's &quot;Moby Dick&quot; as well as to National Geographic, the film succeeds in that much of the terror is in what the audience does not see as well as what it does see.  Only at the end, with Quint's demise, does the audience become aware of the plasticity of the mechanical shark.  Yet one is so caught up in the story, it doesn't matter.  And like 1933's &quot;King Kong&quot;, the shark in &quot;Jaws&quot; seems to get bigger in every scene, so by the end of the film he beats good ol' Moby measure for measure.  The DVD is great, with good extras and a good documentary.
B000001Y79|5.0|In my opinion this is the best album from No Doubt, because it's pure fun, and is packed with energy. From unforgettable chorus lines (&quot;Spiderwebs,&quot; &quot;Just A Girl,&quot; &quot;Different People&quot;), to beautiful ballads (&quot;Don't Speak,&quot; &quot;The Climb&quot;), this is a fun album for anybody.
B00005RFAI|4.0|One of the greater surprise in the pop scene this year is how PINK undergoes a dramatic transformation from a R&B pop queen to a pop-rock Alanis with her sophomore album, M!SSUNDAZTOOD. With 4 Non-Blonde's Linda Perry and rock icons such as Steven Tyler, PINK injects a dose of funk-rock to her right-in-your-face hip-hop attitude. Fans may decry at her for being a rip-off of Gwen Stefani and Nelly Furtado, yet astute listeners will find Pink's courage in seeking her identity a fruitful one. A spin on her first track M!SSUNDAZTOOD will make you realize that self-parody is in the air and her second track, Don't Let Me Get Me Confirms that. In a catchy Californian pop rock style, Pink belts out blatantly \\"Teachers dated me/ My parents hated me/.... don't compare me to (...) Britney Spears/ cos' i am not that pretty/\\" Just like a Pill brings out Pink's energetic spunk and deadpanned irony, \\"Just like a pill/ instead of making me better/ you make me ill\\". Her first single, \\"Getting the Party Started\\" is a rowdy party filler with a hip-hop ghetto feel which sounds uncannily like an Offspring's Americana single.<br />The gems are earthed in the later part of the album. \\"RESPECT\\" suits Pink's blatant style to a glove and is essentially a girl's anthem to command respect. \\"Family Portrait\\" is poignantly heartfelt and a sorrowful paean on dysfunctional families - vividly with cutting lyrics \\"I don't want my mother to change my last name/ I will try to be better/ Daddy, please come back\\". Misery is another country-folk pop that strums with emotions. Her collaboration with Steven Tyler is cataclysmic; both with raging vocals that magnifies the emotion of the song. EVENTUALLY is Pink's stab at people who treated her shabbily. How true when she sings \\"I drank your poison when you said it was wine. Shame on you if you fool me once/ Shame on me if you fool me twice... I hope you gets yours eventually/ I hope I'll be there./\\" Lonely Girl (feat. Linda Perry) is another poetic rendition of Pink's thoughts on stardom and her emotional baggage with sacrifices. <br />This album is rough at the edges but definitely not hollow. We witness Pink's honest grit in her materials and even a streak of rebellion as well as introspectiveness in some of her songs. Her vulnerability in the translation of her own songs sprouts a spark of surprise and novelty for the listener. This change may hint betrayal to her fans who are accustomed to her hip R&B image, but in this business - you lose some as you gain some. Pink has forgo her commercialized success to indulge in her own rock style. Thankfully, she rocks with attitude. You go, girl.
B000002UAU|5.0|This is quite possibly the most groundbreaking album ever made.  It is the most diverse album of its time, with instrumentation changing from song to song, and features some of the most compelling songwriting that I've ever heard.  As it stretches the possibilities of what rock music can achieve, it never loses sight of the melody, and remains cohesive throughout.  I won't get into the songs, because they are all known, and if you aren't familiar, then you really need to get a copy.  Just put it on, relax, and enjoy, as this album is pure entertainment in and of itself.

B00005QDW5|5.0|Most of Pink Floyd's albums were built around a concept and/or a certain theme. This latest Greatest Hits compilation Echoes is a concept album in it's self. <br />Rather than taking on the themes of the how life can drive certain people insane (Dark Side of The Moon), original guitarist Sid Barrett (Wish You Were Here), or outright isolation of a rock musician (The Wall). The concept here on Echoes is the music that made Pink Floyd who they are.<br />Echoes begins and end with songs written and performed by Barrett and both coming from their first full-length record &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; (Astronomy Domine and Bike). In-between are most of the works that made the band famous, including their first singles that came out before &quot;Piper&quot; (Arnold Layne and See Emily Play). The band itself had the say in what songs would be feature and how those songs would be put into order, and everyone involved pull off a great job. Some of the transitions in this project are great, especially the way &quot;Marooned&quot; (originally from &quot;The Division Bell&quot;) serves as a two minute transition between &quot;Hey You&quot; (The Wall) and &quot;The Great Gig In Sky.&quot; (Dark Side of the Moon) Another great transition is between &quot;Us and Them&quot; and &quot;Learning To Fly&quot; which is hard to explain in words but just hear it for yourself and you will know what I am talking about. <br />Floyd's longer pieces &quot;Echoes&quot; (Meddle) and Shine on You Crazy Diamond (Wish You Were Here) are also featured in this CD but are edited due time restraints and trying to give some of their work some time. To hear any of the edited pieces in their entirety one has to buy the respected CD's they were originally on.<br />On this CD the song &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; goes into the Barrett piece &quot;Jugband Blues&quot; (A Saucerful of Secrets) which acts as sort of a response to &quot;Wish&quot; although &quot;Jugband&quot; was recorded first.<br />There was much to cover and in order to do that a lot of stuff and to be omitted. This compilation does not feature songs from the albums More, Ummagumma, Atom Heart Mother, and Obscured By Clouds, along with the single &quot;Careful with that Axe Eugene.&quot; <br />Many fans of Floyd have complained about what Floyd songs should and should have not be include in Echoes. You can't please everyone including the fans, and more likely there is not going to be a follow up best of project from Pink Floyd. If you are new to Pink Floyd &quot;Echoes: Best of...&quot; is a great way to get a musical crash course on this band. For old fans it's should not be passed up cause it's a new way of doing things. After all most good musicians are &quot;not&quot; purest themselves.
B00003CXSP|4.0|After the acclaimed 'Silence Of The Lambs', a sequel was almost inevitable.  When it was finally disclosed that there would be, there was much speculation on who exactly would get the role - it seemed to be between Gillian Anderson and Julianne Moore.  Whilst Anderson may have been the more obvious choice, her role as Scully in leading TV series 'The X-Files' actually being based on that of Clarice Starling, Julianne Moore is fantastic.  Where Jodie Foster turned down the role for the movie being too graphic (she's right), Moore makes the most out of a very different character.  Whereas 'The Silence Of The Lambs' depended on Clarice and Hannibal's interaction, a few years down the line we've got a much more subdued, hardened Clarice that spends most of her time in the basement of the F.B.I (again with the Scully links).  When she actually does meet Lectre, it's utterly mesmerising - this down to great performances on both sides.<br />As for Hannibal's character, it's become a little camp with phrases such as 'goodie goodie' and 'okey dokie' that are nowhere near as unnerving as the director obviously intended them to be.  It is unfortunate that when the audience is treated to old tapes of some of Hannibal's most famous quotes from the previous film, that we get to realise that the character is just not as good.<br />Disregarding this though, it's very competent and managed to evade being pulled apart by the critics.  Ridley Scott also gets rid of, or lessens the role of, several characters in the book such as Margot and Barney that played out an interesting subplot in the book.  There are some scenes from Thomas Harris' novel that doubtless people wanted to see, such as Verger's disembowlment by a huge conger eel, but these are cut.  Although this may upset some fans, in the long run it works and cuts the long book down a great deal without taking from the main story.<br />Still, looking back, 'Silence Of The Lambs' was so much better.
B000002MP2|5.0|In 1993 Green Day put out an album that hit America in a strange way. I even remember in first grade my friends would sing &quot;Basket Case&quot; and run aroung the playground. The songs on Dookie were Green Day's most unique lyrics. I still don't see how they can come out with a tune that just hits you right there in your heart, so whenever &quot;Basket Case,&quot; &quot;Long View,&quot; or When I come Around&quot; would come on the radio you would scream out in joy, &quot;YES!!!&quot; So Dookie holds it's place as my favorite Green Day album.
0871137380|5.0|I am in the Navy in Mexico, being a avid researcher of American military policy, I can say this book is very unbiased and accurate. For example here in Mexico the news reports we get in comparison to CNN are almost the opposite in cases. Especially the Somolia case. Bowden tells it like it is through the entire book. Another book that is quite popular in Mexico as the author lives here described the Desert Storm conflict before it occured and now predicts Armageddon in The Plains of Jezreel, describes new weapons that the allied forces use against Chinese forces, a type of wave pulse that stops the heart beat of invading forces. Also predicted the F 35 Joint Strike Fighter ten years ago. SB 1 or God By Karl Mark Maddox

B00003CXRP|2.0|This tired retelling of the Robinson Crusoe story is not only dull, it's also distinctly ordinary.  Whilst Zemeckis touched his audience with 'Forrest Gump' and scared them all with 'What Lies Beneath', this is a film that seems to have been released purely to show us all Tom Hanks' formidable acting skills.  In the film Hanks plays Chuck, who is separated from his wife after his plane crashes and he, the only survivor, is forced to eke out an existence on a tropical island for four years, forging a friendship with a ball called Wilson.<br />Whilst Hanks' acting is undoubtedly good, he always seems to play Mr. Joe Regular and the scenes on the island are incredibly dull.  We see Chuck light a fire, smash a coconut and fish.  This makes up the majority of the movie, with themes such as madness being explained away with a frankly bizarre 'friendship' with a ball.  In this lies the movie's main failure - it's not particularly bad but it is particularly dull.  Devoid of any other characters - save Helen Hunt as his wife in a role so minimal it even rivals Laura Dern's in 'Jurassic Park III' - we're forced to concentrate on the same things over and over.<br />Still, the airplane crash is stunningly done and the ending is thankfully a little less contemporary than would be expected.  Yet compared alongside, Zemeckis' other film that year - 'What Lies Beneath' - this is nothing.  Just another stepping stone in Tom Hanks career as he garners yet more award nominations.
0385505833|5.0|Skipping Christmas has got to be one of the funniest books I've ever read. You'll be laughing the whole way through at the dispense of poor Luther, who is sick of everything Christmas. He hates traffic, presents, ham, turkey, parties, fruit cake, and decorations. All he wants is to skip Christmas altogether. An amazing accomplishement for Grisham. A Must-read book!
630027120X|5.0|This movie is a favorite of mine because of its adherence to the old principles of movie-making: beautiful cinematography and attention to detail. The movie isn't trying to make you jump in suprise, but to immerse you into its characters and its scenery.<BR>If you feel a need to have an action sequence or plot twist every five minutes, this is not the movie for you. If you enjoyed the languid plot development of movies such as The Deer Hunter, which aim to tell a human story rather than to force a series of exciting moments, then you will love this movie.
B00005JKES|5.0|This is just great! Twin Peaks was probably the best show on television ever and I shudder to think that I will probably never witness a television show as good for the rest of my life. Twin Peaks changed my life. Period.<br />The DVD presentation is top-notch, with enlightening commentary tracks by key people (introduced by Michael Anderson, the midget). The DTS audio is fantastic! If you have an AV Receiver with DTS capability, make sure you select this option on the DVD! The video quality is just superb.<br />The David Lynch directed episodes are just great, especially the Red Room sequences.  Wow Bob Wow!<br />Just get this DVD! Heck, you gotta own DVDs of the best TV series ever. And the extras make it that much more worthwhile.<br />I agree that it would have been nice to have the pilot included too. However I'll take what I can get. I hope that someday the pilot will be released as a separate DVD-I will buy it. I'm also hoping for the 2nd season to be released on DVD.
0393316041|4.0|In his book, Feynman includes a collection of anecdotes, spanning from his days as a mischievous lad, to his days as an undergraduate at MIT, to his later days, after winning the Nobel prize in physics. <br />There are a couple of boring sections (I found the chapter on safe-cracking to get tiring after a while).  And I often found myself questioning whether he was embellishing his stories to make them more entertaining.<br />Nevertheless, Feynman's adventures are very interesting to read about.  He describes how he learned to play the drums and bongo, and how he learned to draw and paint.  His visits to Brazil and Japan were also enjoying to read about (I particularly like the part where he is in Japan, and is compelled to eat something that &quot;was convoluted, like a brain&quot;.)    <br />Feynman's disdain for the stuffy and pompous is reflected in his unpretentious style of writing which makes this book even more likable and easy to read.<br />I read that Feynman, after winning the Nobel prize in physics, went to his his high school to look up the results of his old IQ test.  To his delight, he scored only 124 (not much higher than the typical college graduate), and is reported to have said, &quot;To win the Nobel prize is not that big a deal, but to win it with an IQ of 124 is a real accomplishment!&quot;

B00005JKES|5.0|Twin Peaks is among my favorite TV shows of all time.  It's quirky characters, slow languid pacing and mixture of innocence and sething evil are intoxicating to me.  It's a true pleasure to finally have the first season on DVD.<br />NEW VIEWERS OF TWIN PEAKS BEWARE!  Twin Peaks is a mystery and some of it's secrets are revealed in a few of the episodes directors commentaries as well as the supplemental material on disc 7.  If you want a completely unspoiled Peaks experience, these sections should not be watched until the ENTIRE run of the show has been seen (this includes season 2).  Not that spoilers are rampant, they're not.  But every now and then a slip up reveals something that shouldn't be known to new viewers.  What's revealed?  Well the most egregious of all is Laura Palmer's killer.  This is no problem for long time Peaks Freaks, but why they'd want to ruin the experience for new viewers is beyond me.  Watch out!<br />The series is split into 4 discs (2 shows per disc with the fouth holding episode 7 and bonus material).  The picture and sound are the best I've ever seen them for Twin Peaks.  The only time the picture is lacking is for the Log Lady introductions which look terribly fuzzy and hazy.  Not that it matters much to me, as I never liked those segements anyway and you have option of watching them or not.  The menu system is beautiful and fairly easy to navigate.  My only qualm is that the text is a bit small even on my 36&quot; TV.  There is a terrific Twin Peaks family tree type thing on disc 7 that shows you each characters relationships to others and allows you to view the actors biography, a taped interview and their other credits.  It's a terrific resource!<br />The Twin Peaks pilot has been caught up in legal battles for many years and as such it's not included in this set.  It's a damn shame, but you can find foreign copies of it (in english) on eBay.  This set makes up for it's omission with a page in the booklet devoted to important characters indtrodced in the pilot as well as another page summarizing the plot.  Not as good as having the pilot included, but certainly every effort to make up for it was made.<br />This a &quot;must buy&quot; set for Peaks fans and the best presentation the show has ever had.  I'll be watching this many times over for many years to come.  I only wish the mystery wasn't spoiled for new viewers in some of the supplemental materials.  Here's hoping the second season and a US release of the original pilot are coming soon!ters indtrodced in the pilot as well as another page summarizing the plot.

B00005K3NY|1.0|My one-star rating is for this DVD, not the film, which is Cronenberg at his brilliant best.  I find it utterly contemptible that such an obscenely rich company as MGM would have the gall to release such a shoddy DVD.  Simply put, the last reel is out of sync, effectively ruining the crucial final 30 minutes of the film.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  Avoid this DVD like the plague until a more reputable company gives SCANNERS the proper DVD treatment it so rightfully deserves.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I love Star Wars ,but I know I am not alone on that comment that It's about time George Lucas give the fans what we want! Is the special edition DVD to the Star Wars trilogy. 6 discs loaded with stuff that would take an entire day to see!!!! that would be Star Wars Heaven. I'm sorry ,but Episode 1 is just isn't enough.

As a film version of Shakespere's the Tempest it is hardly comparable, but that is coming from a know it all college kid.  I loved this film and have watched it many times.  The visual candy is outstanding and the directing is top notch.  I still don't understand a lot of it, but that is part of it's beauty.  I can understand the plot, but watch it over and over and gain some new piece of insite every time.  For any non-lazy film watcher this is a must have . . .  if you'd rather your movies had no point and explained any deeper itself then you may want to let this one pass.
B00003CX5P|2.0|When I was finished with the Special Edition, I waited ravenously for TPM (The Phantom Menace for all those who don't know). I've been a Star Wars fanatic since I first saw them on USA's yearly christmas broadcasts. I waited and waited, refusing to look at any Star Wars sites online, so it didn't spoil the whole experience for when I finally did see it.<br />First off, I must commend whoever made the decision to start the Star Wars fun with Episode Four. Episode One, if premiered in 1977, would've ruined it's future entirely. <br />TPM was a blatant attempt to attract younger kids into the hype. That's all that TPM was. Hype. The first three movies (reffering to IV,V,VI) were full of darkness and life-and-death battles. Not TPM.<br />And of course, most people will agree with me. Jar Jar. Possibly the most annoying character in all of Star Wars history. Another thing that really ticked me off was Darth Maul. I'm a big fan of the Sith. The Sith, in my opinion, are better than the Jedi by far. It's is utterly stupid to have a Sith Lord say approx. two lines, then die. In the first movie at that. If that's the best that the Sith can come up with, I don't know what the Jedi have been fearing all this time.<br />TPM did have it's good points. The battles, both in space and with lightsabers, did have my blood pumping the entire time. Obi-Wan, while the casting could've been better, was an awesome fighter, and tapping into the Dark Side at the end was the perfect touch. Anakin ticked me off as well. How could Luke Skywalker descend from him. He must have inherited most of his courage and skill from Amidala. When you first see this kid, you think \\"Hey! This cannot be Darth Vader!\\"<br />SPOILER[....]
B00005ATQC|5.0|Upon first viewing this movie, I was very much intrigued. The second viewing was a revelation. The things I missed the first time, I caught subsequently, and had sort of a \\"Oh, now I get it!\\" type experience.<br /><br />From the open, as Nicole is sitting on the toilet talking with Tom in the couples gorgeous town house bathroom while dressing for a \\"high\\" society soiree, you have a feeling something very strange is going to happen.  When they arrive, and you spend some time with each of them at the party, there is no doubt that this is a story that is far removed from the average.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick made some very interesting films in his lengthy and well respected career. Certainly \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is one of the wierdest ever lensed. I think \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" certainly has a somewhat surrealistic mood too. It isn't a day-glo visually harrowing surrealism like \\"Clockwork...\\" but it IS a creepy and strangely compelling film that requires more than one viewing to fully grasp.<br /><br />I DO think it's hard to believe that jealousy would ever lead a husband into such utter depravity. We're not talking just ANY depravity, but stuff that would make your run of the mill sociopath cringe.<br /><br />I find this film quite fascinating on a whole, and have made it a part of my personal library. I think the leads did a fine job with this odd script and plot. I especially enjoy director Sydney Pollack playing an associate of Tom in the film, he brings an earnest touch to the few roles he plays in general.  (He has also recently appeared on NBC comedy \\"Will and Grace\\" as Will's dad).<br /><br />There were lots of mixed reviews to \\"Eyes...\\", and I think that you will have to give this at least two chances to decide fairly what YOU think. For me, the film was riveting from the open, but I enjoy the occasional offbeat outing. Once again, I must re-iterate that this film definitely gets deeper and richer upon repeated viewings.  If you like it a little the first time, you may love it the second time around. One thing is certain, even if you watch only once, be sure to keep YOUR eyes wide open so you don't miss a thing!around.

0393964582|5.0|Two things are amazing. This book and the reviewer who says &quot;Despite many strengths, Frankenstein has fatal flaws&quot;. I find it grotesque when &quot;critics&quot; pick apart a masterpiece, a work that the critic themselves couldn't create in their wildest dreams. A work that they couldn't match with anything in their boring lives.<br />Yes, you can find something &quot;wrong&quot; in any work of art or science. But when something is so amazing as is this book (one of the greatest of all time, including the future), one should temper their criticism with praise. Point out all the good points , the amazing points, and the &quot;flaws&quot; will disappear as unimportant.<br />Critics are so pitiful.

B000002UB3|5.0|The Beatles were the greatest rock/pop band of all time.  That is indisputable.  Abbey Road was more than their farewell.  It is their geatest album.  When you consider the White Album and Sgt Peppers Lonely Lonely Hearts Club Band, that becomes a strong statement, but it is true.  They were at the top of their art form.  Something (George Harrison's greatest song) and Get Toether highlight the original side one, but it also includes the mesmerizing, She's so Heavy.  Maxwell's Silver Hammer is the quintesential Beatle's humor offering and the light Ringo offering, Octopus's Garden somehow works in this mix.  After you flip the vinyl, however, things get very interesting.  Your CD will carry right into &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; one of Lennon's most melodic and upbeat songs ever.  This is the lead in for the best side of any pop album that has ever been recorded.  John was not particularly pleased with how McCartney edited together the melange that begins with &quot;Mean Mr Mustard&quot; and ends with the the Beatles Coda, &quot;the End&quot;  The truth is, that it represents pure genius. Never before or since, has one side of a recording captured so purely the essence of a band, as side two of Abbey Road. Throw in the story cover, with it's clues about the &quot;Paul is dead&quot; farce and you have the greatest rock/pop recording in history.  THIS IS YOUR DESERT ISLAND RECORDING!!!<br />If you don't own it- Buy it now.  If you only own it, on Vinyl, buy the CD.  If you haven't listened to this recording in 30 years, you must hear it again.  Stop reading this and buy it now.

Because of this book and others of Linda Howard's, I have circles under my eyes and am delirious from lack of sleep. I have to say Jaine Bright is my favorite character out of all Linda Howard's protagonists. And Sam Donavan?

B00004Z459|4.0|&quot;A music fan from 'Zona, USA&quot; has a point, but there's no denying that there are some quality songs on this album. It isn't true metal, more heavy rock/pop/hip-hop, but that doesn't make it a bad album. Unlike Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park don't litter their songs with obscenities just to appeal to pre-pubescent boys who think they're being cool/rebelious by listening to nu-metal with swearing (although I must admit Bizkit do have some good songs...), but their lyrics aren't that special (for good lyrics just listen to Rage Against the Machine - great band). The riffs are cool and the twin vocals are cool. I wouldn't recommend this to a seasonned metaller, but for people looking for something a bit heavier and with more quality, this is your band.
B000002MP2|3.0|strange,punks is supposed to be fast moving yet somehow half the songs on this album seem to quite dull, such as pulling teeth.but fortunatly burnout,she and the sublime basket case safe this album from being the dullest punk album ever
B00005U11Z|5.0|Finally! A DVD comes out for those who have waited in vain for it. As Neal Schon said, changes has always been crucial to the band's success. After all, without Steve Perry, Journey would not have charted mainstream. There is NO Steve Perry in this DVD. But Steve Augeri proves he can carry Journey just as well with his oddly similar voice. Augeri sang even better when I saw Journey at San Francisco's Warfield, 1999. It's a new chapter for these five guys. All my favorite hits to sing along to. <br />Cmon! Don't you remember when you held your sweetheart tightly in your arms at your high school dance, listening to &quot;Faithfully&quot;. I did!

B000001OAA|5.0|Given the circumstances of Garbage's formation (lead singer Shirley Manson was seen on MTV by her bandmates and ordered up like pizza) you'd be quick to assume that this would be a bit of an awkward album... far from it though. Manson and the &quot;ladyboys&quot; sound like they've been together for years, working to bring you the lavish work that is their debut. From the purrs and crashes on &quot;Supervixen&quot;, to the lullaby &quot;Milk&quot; the album defies conventional formulas. Jaw dropping pauses in the middle of songs (Supervixen), mish mashed soundscapes (Heaven is Wide, Not my Idea) to post grunge moanings (Vow, Only Happy When It Rains), Garbage proves to be nothing like their namesake. Productions genius, stellar vocals, goregous music... this cd has it all.
B00005R2M3|5.0|ok, i am usually a follower of bands like blink182, staind, or linkin park, but when i saw shakira on mtv awhile back, i knew so was way better than those bands i just named. first of all, she must have incredible talent to write songs in english, and i respect her greatly for that. and all of her songs are wonderful! i especially like underneath your clothes. she can be emotional in her songs, but then can also produce very fun, dancable songs. ever since i got this cd, i have not stopped listening to it. its a rare thing when you can listen to a cd, and then when its done, listen to it again...and shakira has perfected this.

B00001QGPR|5.0|The album feels like Hunky Dory, except it doesn't. Keeping with the theme of alternate, parallel universes it almost feels like 'hours...' harkens back to when &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; was a flop. <br />If &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; was a flop, this almost feels like it would be the follow up piece to it, instead of &quot;Hunky Dory.&quot; This album is far from hunky dory, but is just as great, and is so beautiful and serene. &quot;Something In the Air&quot; is my fave on the album and &quot;New Angels of Promise&quot; is also very great. In fact, all of the songs have a rich and deep feel to it. If you know a little bowie history, you would know that his career in the 60's was a failure.. he was continually frustrated by his inability to make a hit in the field. that all changed with his fantastic single &quot;Space Oddity.&quot; So after that his career was sort of on a fork in the road. He could either follow up with a hit or another flop. If &quot;The Man Who Sold The World&quot;  failed, who's to say that there would even be a Hunky Dory, or a Ziggy for that matter? 'hours...' feels like it belongs in the past, but not in THIS past.. it belongs in an alternate universe, a world of regret and missed opportunites.<br />in this world, where he is truly happy, bowie has had a successful and copious life... 'hours...' is an anthem to what might have been and is another fantastic undertaking by db.
6305609705|5.0|I am a film buff who enjoys both American Sci-Fi and 1960's new wave film. Apocalypse now is one of my favorite films of all time and one of the most powerful... And thank God for DVD -- we finally can see it properly in home theatres. The transfer quality of this DVD is incredible, the colors and sound are just brilliant, and faithfully reproduce the original.<br />If you haven't seen Apocalypse Now, be prepared -- it is without a doubt the most moving, troubling, difficult Vietnam movie (or war movie) yet made in my opinion, and I've seen them all, old and new. It is a modern understanding of Conrad's Heart of Darkness, preserving every bit of the darkness and intent of the original novel to demonstrate once again what lies deep within the souls of men and the jungles of our hearts.<br />This is the only film ever to cause me to break down completely in the first 90 seconds, without a single character in sight or a line of dialog having been heard; it never lets up. It's an incredible, horrible, important film that will leave you exhausted once you see all 153 minutes.
B000001ABD|2.0|First things first: Stevie Wonder's album output of the '70s is<br />among the finest continuous strings in the history of<br />popular recorded music. Of that there cannot be any<br />argument. What can be argued is that there has never been<br />a wholly satisfactory compiliation that summarizes his entire<br />career, save for the 4CD set &quot;End of a Century&quot;. Admittedly,<br />it's a difficult task, since you need to cover the '60s<br />Motown &quot;factory&quot; era, which yielded a lot of great pop/R&amp;B<br />singles, the '80s and '90s which yielded a few delights,<br />though they are too sparsly scattered, and the '70s which<br />are hard to distill at all, since the original albums are so consistently strong.<br />That said, this collection is just not very good. The<br />sequencing is ridiculous (starting with the disposable<br />&quot;Part Time Lover&quot;?) and the track selection is questionable<br />(a lot of grade A tracks were left off so that...what?...they<br />could include &quot;Ebony and Ivory&quot;?) Ounce for ounce, Original<br />Musicquarium, a good if too-short compilation of the '70s<br />is a better bet. You could couple Original Musiquarium<br />with a '60s hits compilation (unfortunately, there's not<br />good definitive '60s set, but I guess you could go with<br />Greatest Hits Vol I [too bad Motown &amp; Stevie haven't seen fit<br />to reissue the excellent 3LP &quot;Looking Back&quot; which DID cover<br />the '60s stuff properly) and get most of the essential Stevie<br />Wonder. But at that point, you'd still be missing the few<br />highlights from the 80s and 90s. For example, the brilliant<br />Overjoyed (good tune and dig that incredible phrasing) and<br />Stevie's terrific cover of Bob Marley's &quot;Redemption Song&quot; which<br />is available on no other compilation but this one.<br />At the end of the day, the Stevie Wonder compilation catalogue<br />is still something of a mess (due in no small part to the<br />fact that Stevie has veto power over any Motown reissue), and<br />IMHO you're left with only two good alternatives: The 4 CD<br />&quot;End of a Century&quot;, which is quite good, even if it is also<br />completely obvious in track selection, or the 2CD Original<br />Musiquarium. Or, heck, go back and buy the '70s albums, since<br />they are truly all worth owning in their entirty anyway, then<br />maybe break down and buy In Circle Square because you HAVE<br />to own Overjoyed. Maybe.and<BR>IMHO you're left with only two good alternatives: The 4 CD<BR>&quot;End of a Century&quot;, which is quite good, even if it is also<BR>completely obvious in track selection, or the 2CD Original<BR>Musiquarium.

0688172377|4.0|I found the book and Waris' journey interesting. Amazing in that people outside our lives, can be and are so different to us. 'We' have NO ideal what goes on in other countries, especially that in Africa.<br />Dirie begins as a nomad in Somalia. When she was forced to marry, very young, to an older man-she decided that it wasn't for her and she didn't want to do it. So she ran away in her early teens, on barefoot across the African deserts.<br />Dirie manages, perhaps by pure luck, to be able to make it from one place to another and eventually onto London. Everything feel into place for her. Unfortunately (but that's the law) she had to do things to get around the law. Faking passports, marrying someone to remain in Europe, etc. But I suppose desperation situations calls for desperate measures, at least this is how she clearly felt.<br />Dirie describes her journeys from nomad to superstar model and she is a spokesperson against Female Genital Mutilation-as she and millions of other girls has to go through (especially in tribes in Africa) which causes great physical pain, great humiliation and embarrassment and sometimes even death. But of course, growing up and living in a secluded culture, people grow to know NOTHING else.<br />The book is a real eye opener, especially and moreso than anything else, when it comes to FGM. I recommend the book to male or female to understand, as much as we can, how and what it feels like to be a female Somalia nomad. Short read, easy read but to the point...4 stars...

B00003CWNR|5.0|In a recent review, Roger Ebert wrote that The Cider House Rules is &quot;all process and no destination&quot;. His two-star rating credited the film with &quot;many charming sequences and an overall sense of intelligence&quot;, but found that these lacked relevance within a meaningful plot line. &quot;What is the movie really about and where does it lead&quot; was his rhetorical verdict.<br />This criticism suggests a narrow view of what makes a movie work. It reproduces a familiar Hollywood blockbuster model where, beneath the surface, characters and plots tend to work in predictable ways. For all their obvious strengths, these blockbuster heroes are essentially passive. They move because they are pushed and pulled. Their lot is to solve or deal with things imposed upon them by history, circumstance and a preconfigured soul. Whatever motivations they have--deep reasons for behaving in one way rather than another--are not their own but received from above, and explained neither to themselves nor to the audience, presumably because no explanation is necessary.<br />This passiveness may go unnoticed behind bold elements in the film, and behind trappings that make the characters seem masters of themselves. A film may intoxicate with over-the-top theatrics, mind-blowing special effects, and heady drama and romance, all calculated to leave us reeling rather than critical. Characters appear determined and courageous; hard-hitting but also tender; flawed, yet graced with a redemptive justice that wins the day and our sympathy in the end. But passive characters can never be strong willed, determined, powerful or original because they lack the inner source these conditions entail. Remove the distractions and we would see only clones, characters whose so-called inner drive and originality are really just surrogates for the same, monotonous ethical standpoint, itself completely unexamined by the character or by the audience. No one wonders why so many characters from different movies all think in the same ethical terms, make the same choices, have the same sense of justice, make, recognize and fix the same ethical mistakes. Have they all been talking to each other? <br />In a ratings-driven commercial environment, this singular vision is also dogmatic: it does not merely represent one idea but silences alternatives. The Cider House Rules apparently got bad press from Ebert because it doesn't fit a standard mold. Its hero, Homer Wells, is more than just a billboard for stereotypes; instead, he dares to be an active agent in his own destiny. If a cloistered childhood supplied an urge to leave home, neither he nor the audience knows any more than that when it happens; you might have seen it coming but you don't know where it's going. All we know, and all he knows, is that he wants to see the ocean. Such is the lot of someone driven from within in a world too large for comprehension. Unlike the kind of character above, you feel that any future is possible for Homer, and that the things he will learn are up for grabs. You feel that his own will and openness, as much as external circumstance, lead to the events that happen: his time on the apple orchard, his love affair, and his return home. <br />His love affair is with a married woman, but because Homer's discovery is genuine and not dictated by an installed moral program, the usual moral taboos don't kick in the same way. He is not a sinner who must repent or else be despised, but a learner who will come to reframe past events within a developing conscience and a growing foundation of experience, whatever that turns out to be. He also learns about contradiction, a real kind that potted characters never face. When Homer discovers his boss's incest, the audience witnesses the genuine paradox of someone for whom a consistent morality isn't worked out yet. Homer genuinely abhors the incest, but cannot answer the boss when confronted with his own affair with a married woman. He can only repeatthat incest is wrong.<br />At that point the issue of abortion returns. Homer faces a decision to recognize his training and the oath it implies, and thus comes full circle as a character who now understands a balance between the lure of new discovery and responsibility to one's own past. This new understanding leads him to return home again to fill the vacuum left by Dr. Larch. Fittingly, it is a position of greater responsibility to the orphanage than he ever had before. You know that the orphanage is again in good hands and has a bright future, precisely because Homer has made a journey to get there, a journey through experiences whose unpredictability was also their vitality. <br />This does not describe a movie with no destination, a journey without a purpose. It merely describes a movie with a refreshingly new, profoundly human purpose, one without many of the usual canned elements Hollywood so often depends on. In this sense I believe Ebert's review substantially missed the point. You do know what the movie was about and where it led by the time it ends. If the unpredictability of the meantime had been traded to satisfy usual expectations, it might have earned more stars but it would also have ruined the movie. As it stands, viewers can appreciate full, vital characters, top-notch acting in all key roles, and the work of a master storyteller flowing underneath. Too few Hollywood products can make that claim.
0684800713|4.0|This is the first Hemingway novel I have read.<br />I both enjoyed it and found it puzzling.  I disliked the characters yet also liked them.  I enjoyed Hemingway's prose style.  Some of the descriptions, the constant moving about from bar to bar, is rather a nuisance in a sense, yet also entirely necessary in that it serves to parallel the overall scheme of the novel.<br />Well worth reading, even if just to admire Hemingway's style.  Like another person pointed out, this reads much like an extended short story.  The fishing trip is very nice; the best scene, which had me most into the book, was the when the boxer got a few punches in--!
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD really took me by surprise. I never liked groups like limp bizkit who claim to be rap-metal and sound like trash (wes borland is a excellent... guitar player though!!!).  But Linkin Park makes the fusion of rap and rock sound great.  Songs like \\"In The End\\", \\"Crawling\\", and \\"Cure For the Itch\\" will leave you astounded.  This is a CD that you can listen to the entire way through and all day long.  This should be a definite addition to the music collection of any fan of hard rock or anyone who is sick of weak crossover bands.

Why did China become a strong and unified giant nation while Europe split up into many nations? How did Pizarro kill so many people with so few men? Guns, Germs, and Steel takes you through a journey of the history of man and is a must read for anyone that wants to attempt to understand the world we live in and how it got there.
B00005QZWI|4.0|Another person reviewing this album commented, appropriately, that some soundtracks stand on their own better than others, and felt this soundtrack lacks something without the movie.  I agree--but only because this soundtrack is sooooo evocative of the movie, it stirs me to want to be watching again what is musically portrayed.  The soundtrack and movie are worthy of each other--I can speak no higher praise.  Perhaps it IS only a soundtrack, without the movie; nonetheless it contains some hauntingly beautiful moments that make me want to replay it over and over.
B0000048V8|5.0|The Snowman is a beautiful animation with a soothing story that my kids love to watch as we are winding down for bed.  The soundtrack is very gentle, and I think the kids find it comforting.  The bottom line is that we have seen this video HUNDREDS of times.  I am actually sick of it, but it certainly has been a favorite with my children over the last couple of years (ages 2-4).  There is no dialog in the video, so it is nice that the kids get captivated by just the artistry, music, and simple, warm story.  If you have small kids, you will be happy you bought this video.
B00005U11Z|5.0|If you want to hear uplifting music by five musicians at the top of their game having a blast and taking the audience along for the ride--Journey's new DVD/VHS is for you. <br />Journey has always been a band that is best live and they do not disappoint in this show. The sound is amazing--particularly on the DVD, but if you have your stereo system running through your VCR, the VHS of this show will make you feel like you are at the concert too. (You can also burn a CD from the DVD to have music to travel by!)<br />The rare versions of Fillmore Boogie and La Raza Del Sol alone are worth the price of the DVD. In Fillmore Boogie, Deen Castronovo's double bass drums together with Ross Valory's bass will rattle your china. Neal Schon proves that he has only gotten better over the years. Neal makes his guitar sing with that sweet, full voice that is distinctively his. He makes the most complex riffs look simple and does it with a smile! Jonathan Cain shows he can not only write brilliant songs, but can rock out on the keyboards.<br />Then there is Steve Augeri. Steve has a playful stage presence that will win over the coldest heart. He shows he can sing the ballads with beautiful renditions of Lights and Open Arms. He rocks out on Escape and Be Good to Yourself and he really shines on the blues numbers like Lovin' Touchin' Squeezin'. <br />If you love good music, great musicians, and want to spend 106 minutes feeling great, buy this DVD or VHS tape.

B00004RF98|5.0|&quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; is simply the greatest Movie Musical of all time. This is a movie that everyone needs to get around to seeing sooner or later, but none of the others on that list (&quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; &quot;Casablanca,&quot; etc.) are anywhere near as happy a viewing experience as this one. Gene Kelly dancing to the title song is an indelible Top 10 Movie memory and Donald O'Connor might be a second banana but his &quot;Make 'Em Laugh&quot; is almost as unforgettable. Then there is the whole &quot;Moses supposes his toeses are roses, but Moses supposes erroneously,&quot; which is just a notch below &quot;The pellet with the poison's in the vessel with the pestle&quot; in my mind. Screenwriters Betty Comden and Adolph Green did the lyrics for that Roger Edens tune, while most of the songs were written by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed. Yes, the &quot;Broadway Melody&quot; sequences is shoe horned into the picture, but that is redeemed by the by the punch line at the end when R. F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell) says, &quot;Well, I'll have to see it.&quot; Besides, Cyd Charisse is in it and my father always liked &quot;Cyd Baby&quot; as he called her, which, seeing those long legs, I can understand. The other great in-joke in this film is that Betty Noyes does the singing for Debbie Reynold's dubbing the singing for Jean Hagen because Lina Lamont has a voice that can peel paint (&quot;Well of COURSE we talk. Don't everybody?) and the excuse for all this merriment is that the Lockwood and Lamont silent film &quot;The Dueling Cavalier&quot; needs to be changed into a new fangled talking picture. Remember the rules: If it originally appeared on Broadway then it does not get to be considered as a Movie Musical. This means &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; is not in competition against &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; or &quot;Grease&quot; but rather against &quot;Easter Parade&quot; and &quot;White Christmas.&quot; Ergo, the Greatest Movie Musical of all time.ime.
B00005N9CV|1.0|This is a purely awful offering from an allegedly talented artist.  If you listen to the first track, you've heard them all.

B00000ADG2|5.0|How many awards did she win with this album?  I dont know the exact number but Ill take a guess......... a bunch?  These awards, unlike some, were well-deserved.  Each song is crafted behind real live instruments and guests are only Carlos Santana, Mary J. Blige, and D'Angelo.  She incorporates jazz, hip-hop, R&amp;B and many other elements into this classic album.  The production of this album gets very high praises, however, it's Hill's songwriting that propels this album to extraordinary levels.  Songs like Lost Ones convey emotion and hurt as she calls out one-time friend and partner Wyclef Jean( or at least it seems like it).  Her ability to enlighten the public on Doo Wop ( That Thing) to such great detail is almost surreal.  Or her insightfulness on When It Hurts So Bad and Everything is Everything.  Nothing Even Matters, the excellent collaboration with D'Angelo, is a song about depression and keeping a loved one.<br />Simply put this is one of the most unique efforts I have ever heard.  Emotion also plays a key element and it sounds like she actually tried on her album and it shines brightly.<BR>Almost any topic you can think of is portrayed on this cd.  Lauryn Hill sprinkles knowledge, rhythm, beautiful singing and dance into this package.  She even has some of her old battle style lyrics on here that resemble the Fugees heyday.  Because of these features after you finish listening to it, it leaves you extremely satisfied.  Even if Lauryn Hill never dropped another album she would be heralded as one of Hip-Hop's ( or R&amp;B for that matter) greatest.  A Must-Have in your collection.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I am not really into the whole pop music scene, I am more into the new metal groove, but I found this CD to be fantastic. I was expecting it to be all happy pop like the hit single Get This Party Started. Instead it turned into a trek into Pink's own troubled family life and her depression of her own appearance (Don't Let Me Get Me). Something which not to offend girls, but there are lots of girls out there who know exactly what she's talking about. What really kept my interest about this album were the beats. The beats are incredible and every track has a different pop beat, so you don't feel like your listening to the same song over and over. Because of the beats, Pink covers a wide array of genres with such songs like Eventually that has a jazzy saxophone in the background, and Lonely Girl, which has a very cool pop rock sound to it, but her vocals always sound poppy and hip hoppy. This is a surprisingly great CD with lots of meaningful great lyrics, because Pink says exactly how she feels.
B00005NB8J|4.0|First of all why 4 stars then?  Because I like Sci-Fi and while having a History degree I found the Egyptology interesting.<br />Now then, a comment about the guy who doesn't like Letterboxing.  Umm, dude!  DVDs are made for Widescreen presentations!  The letterboxing MAINTAINS the theatrical presentation.  Unless your local theater has a 4:3 screen then you're missing at least a third of the picture by LOVING Pan'n'Scan.  I hate to see what you're going to do when HDTVs are the norm in their 16:9 format.  If anything I HATE watching movies in Pan'n'Scan because I KNOW that there is more picture there that I'm not seeing.  I've been watching VHS widescreen versions for years now on a 27&quot; and have no problem &quot;tuning-out&quot; the black bars.  I have just bought a DVD player and a 32&quot; Sony WEGA Trinitron and Widescreen hasn't looked better.  One step down from HD.<br />But now back to the film itself.  Stargate is about a circular gate that is a portal from one point in space to another through a wormhole.  The portal in this film is one to a planet that apparently has simularities to Earth's Ancient Egypt.  Except the Gods are aliens that have adopted ancient Egyption dieties for appearances.  We have the pharoah-looking Sun God Rah, the jackal-looking Anubis, and the eagle-looking Horus.  They also have cool looking skypods armed with the same energy weapon that the ground troops carry.<br />The film could have been better had the locale and culture of the people there on the alien planet been a little more dynamic.  But at least it spawned a highly successful TV series where these alien worlds and story lines could be fleshed out more.
B0000067X1|5.0|Without question, this is one of the finest albums ever recorded. Yes, that is a bold statement and perhpaps one that is thrown around far too often to invoke much credibility.  Nonetheless this album is a beautiful, challanging and ultimately amazing effort by one of the most extraordinary and brilliant bands, regardless of genre, ever to pick up instrements.  I never would have thought it possible that after a lifetime of studying and appreciating music, that the boundaries of what I thought possible could be changed so rapidly.  But that is precicely what has happened.<br />There are seven tracks on the album, each distinctive and varied, but maintaining an unmistakeable cohesiveness and &quot;feel&quot; characteristic of many great rock and progressive albums.  The grooves here are ubelievable and fresh, even by todays standards.  The standared of playing is one par with ANY band I have ever heard.  Each member is a true master of their instrument, the arrangement of the music providing an arena for personal musical expression, as well as pushing the limits of what the group can do, the complex interweaving of underlying interplay.<br />Notably, the fourth track &quot;Halleluwah&quot; is absolutely fantastic.  Perhaps some of the greatest &quot;rock&quot; ever recorded.  Jaki Liebezeit (drums) and Holger Czukay (bass)provide one of the greatest grooves ever.  Funky and trancelike, remarkably contemporary, it is sustained and surprisingly complex.  Suzuki's vocals are raw and passionate, sometimes real smooth, even though we don't really know what he is saying.<br />Where did these guys come from?  How come I have never heard of them before?!! What can I say,  If you have any predisposition at all for going out one a limb for the sake of trying something new, or just like darn good rock 'n' roll, check this one out.
6305311463|5.0|I thought Armageddon ranked right up there with Godzilla!  No seriously!  As far as special effects go and entertainment, Armageddon was a joyride from start (well from mission start to finale) to finish.  So you have an oil drilling rig crew turned astronaut to drill a 200 foot hole in a iron asteraoid the size of Texas?  So what's so unbelievable about that?  Having seen the flexibility of drilling crews lately have you?  LOL!  Well anyway, I especially liked the Russian Space Station sequence.  &quot;Don't touch nothing!&quot;<br />Well I guess I appreciated this film a little more than the average person after having some core drilling experience myself.  Knowing what the Willis's crew had to do, I had a little more respect for the undertaking.  Drilling ain't easy folks!  Drill down one pipe/auger and then disconnect, add another, reconnect, drill it down, repeat ad nauseum.  Then when you're done, just reverse that method.  Very fun indeed.  So yeah, I had a little more appreciation for the film for this very reason.<br />Now I just gotta comment on Raul's comment below:<br />&quot;However, with so many great films still unavailable on DVD, (La Dolce Vita, Les Regles du jeu, The Magnificent Ambersons), and many not available even on NTSC VHS, (Il Gattopardo, Au Hasard Balthasar), I am flabbergasted at your choosing this flick for the honor of a Criterion release. If raising money is the reason behind this, why not reissue Les 400 Coups, or the Killer instead? If you need ideas for contemporary movies that do deserve your attention, try these, Tous les matins du monde, Zentropa, or The Mystery of Rampo. Thanks.&quot;<br />I just wanna say...&quot;Huh?&quot;  This ain't France, bub.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I could not wait for this video to be released! I finally have the chance to write my review of this brilliant specticle.<br />I saw the movie 5 times in the movie theatre (a record for me!) and I wish I could watch it every day of my life! It's a beautiful film.<br />I remember when the show opened and most of the people in America were VERY stand-offish and wary of this display of fun and its effect on the minds of our young adults. But the film show the power of the &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot; and the Bohemian Movement with Freedom, Beauty, Truth and Love as the mind candy for the era.<br />Nicole Kidman plays Satine and I love every minute of it. I have always love Nic, but I have rarely gone to a film just because she was in it. I am now a very dedicated fan! She is brilliant in this movie. She displays every aspect and every genre that a film actor should hold important. She would be jipped without living the OSCARS with an award in hand. (Did anyone see her brilliant thriller, THE OTHERS??? Another amazing performance...) She is beautiful and wear each regal costume with as much style as Audrey Hepburn and Marlene Dietrich. Nicole is amazing!<br />Ewan McGregor is not only amazing in this film, but he brings such a scattered past to this portrayal. From Transpotting to Star Wars and now to the Moulin Rouge. He has played so many colorful characters and now he brings his real acting and vocal talent to the pedistal and makes each moment unforgettable. He and Nic are the film, though the sets and costumes are brilliant!!<br />Baz has assembled some of the most talented people in showbusiness to create this beautiful &quot;Spectacular, Spectacular&quot; musical/film. He is one of the only directors that can switch from comedy to drama to tragedy within seconds, while the audience feels only the emotions that he want to convey. He writes a mean script and has the eye of a brilliant photographer. This film is filled with some of the most eye-catching effects and arrangements ever brought to the silver screen.<br />BUY THIS DVD VERSION!!! WHY? The special features DVD is amazing and you could sit down and spend the most part of a day just watching the making of the film, interviews and script adaptions. It is a wonderful DVD! I bought it the day it went on sale!<br />I hope everyone enjoys the film and falls in love with the MOULIN ROUGE!!!
B00004ZAV3|1.0|A better way to present The Beatles would be to re-master ALL their recordings using the original master tapes and routing them through tubed electronics.  I've read recording reviews which states that practically all studios used tubed electronics in the 50's, 60's, and a lot still do today. During the time of The Beatles' early recording phase, some studios got away from the very basics of good recording techniques, and started to engage in excessive overdubbing, frequency limiting, dyanamic limiting, or compressing the sound, and mastering through inferior electronics.  Perhaps that's why I was disappointed as a young teen when attempted to upgrade to better sound in the sixties by buying newer stereo versions of some of The Beatles' albums and found to be inferior, in terms of sound quality, to that of the originals. The #1 CD is a prime example of this: Poor dynamics, Poor fidelity, etc. EMI has blown it again! If the original mono recordings sound better than a newer stereo versions, and people had a chance to listen to both, it's a safe bet that most people, I dare say, all people would opt for the mono pressing. [Example: The Mono version of Mercury's recording of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture vs. the Stereo version-there is on comparision-the mono sounds better.]  I grew up in a neighborhood where most people listened to Soul music, but I was among a number blacks who could really appreciate the accomplishments of The Beatles. I was a fan at 12 at the start of The Beatles rise to fame, and my parents were, too. Sure, there were some Soul music die-hards in the neighborhood, but most were willing to give a fair listening to this new group. If the sound quality of #1 was around in the 60's, its very probable that their sales would have suffered, too. Come on guys at EMI: Get it together, mono or high fidelity stereo, give us some decent recordings. I own an Abbey Road album from Mobile Fidelity: Sounds Great!  I implore all people to write, e-mail or call and pressure EMI in England for decent recordings of, in my opinion, the best Rock and Roll group of all time.
6304542836|1.0|This movie should be sued for malpractice.  This is a story about liars and cheaters and it is hailed as a great love story.  Excuse me, but what does love have to do with this story?  NOT A THING!  NOTHING!!!  NADA!!  ZIP!! ZERO!!!  I seriously think this is a story people LIKE TO think they HAVE to LOVE.  What a very sad commentary on our contemporary socieity when Elaine (a fictional character) has more sense than &quot;real&quot; (pretentious!) people!
B00005NB0H|5.0|The Who are somewhat notorious for repackaging their prior albums.  At one point, they had released almost as many &quot;Best Of&quot; packages as they had original albums.  Moreover, Tommy has been released in two different studio versions (not counting the Broadway production) and is included in the Isle of Wight concert.  Finally, Live at Leeds has been released twice before, the original in 1970 or 71 and the expanded in 1995.  The cynical could see this as another attempt to make money out of past exploits.  <BR>They would be wrong. Live at Leeds is one of the best concerts by one of the best live rock bands of all time.  It is understandable that the Who in 1970 did not want to follow Tommy up with a live album that included most of Tommy, but it's too bad that they didn't at least originally release a double album with the 1995 configuration.  I find myself wishing I could have gotten my hands on this 30 years ago.<BR>Even if you have the 1995 version of Live at Leeds, you have to get this one; the performance of Tommy is superior in sound to the Isle of Wight concert and far superior to the big band version that the Who did in the late 80's.  Although Townsend has always been modest about his guitar playing, he is brillant throughout the concert.  Daltrey's singing is amazing, as is the strength of his voice -- he does 90% of the singing of a two-hour plus concert with no weakness at the end.  It's hard to talk about this CD without falling into a stream of superlatives.  The bottom line is that if you like rock, you have to buy this.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Citizen Kane is a classic - a grand story line, fully realized characters, and masterful direction - combine to produce the greatest masterpiece in the history of American cinema. Every film buff should have a copy of this DVD, it truly is a wonderful package combining the movie with details of the intrigue that surrounded it's creation. The film itself is pure genius - a magical tale of the creation of a media empire and how the empire came crumbling down, evenly sprinkled with comedic wit and cinematic innovation. The additional documentary, The Battle over Citizen Kane, delves into the fight between Orson Welles and William Randolph Hearst (the inspiration for Kane), and was nominated for an Academy Award in 1995. This film has always been at the top of my list of all-time great movies, and the DVD became a treasured addition to my collection on the first day it was released. A truly exceptional film !
B000002H2H|3.0|Ok Metallica have always been a good band, yes just good. As a percussionist I must say, they are not as talented as some people think. First, the only bands the younger generation will know about the most is ozzy and metallica, why are they commercialized on the radio, mtv ect. Because they consider all these bands today such as slipknot,korn,limp bizkit,linkin park ect. metal, as they know they arent, aka sell outs if you will. Unfortunately all the great other older classic metal bands do not consider this new music scene metal, which anyone with a good ear for music knows what Im saying is true, are not so popular now by press, ect.  I mean I know 14 year old kids that hate 80s metal, but ozzy and metallica are ok. WHy? Because they still get to be on mtv and the radio, so kids assume their the only worthy enough veterans to listen to.<br />Fight fire with fire-Very cool intro,good timing.Lyrics are way cheesy(the gods are laughing so take your last breath?)<br />Ride the lightning-Excellent rythm, as well as some [great] jamming, but hetfields vocals are just so annoying.  He cant even hold a proper vocal note, I admit Mustaine isnt a great vocalist either, but he didnt just scream in the mic, at least not like hetfield did.<br />For Whom the bell tolls-Yes a metal classic, and the opening 15 second bass solo is awesome, unfortunately James and lars always like to never give the bass any attention on recording a song. Just listen after the short solo by Cliff, the bass sound is gone. Though it is still a damn good song with odd lyrics but cool.<br />Fade to Black-Beatiful melodic song,deep,sad and very dark. The smooth clean guitars are cool, very easy to play but still cool. This song was definitely influenced by Maiden's Children of the damned.  <br />Trapped under ice-I do like how he sings the chorus, but thats about it. The lyrics are very dull and very pointless, but hey, that doesnt mean its a bad song.<br />Escape-Very good song, the chorus again is cool how he sings it, and towards the end hearing the jail siren sound is awesome.<br />Creeping Death-The best metallica lyrics ever, a great song, would be perfect if you could hear some bass, cliff was an awesome bassist...The song is great though. Its just an enjoyable sock em metallica tune.<br />Call of tulu-The opening and closing of this instrumental is very unique, the drumwork and solos are the best thing on it,great timing, but still no bass. Its an excellent instrumental though, a bit complex. Of course since the music was written by mustaine originally, it had to be made complex, as well as deliver the...ass solos written by him as well.:)<br />My opinion this is definitely metallica's best music effort ever, Lars is a [great] drummer, simple and enjoyable. Hetfield is an excellent rythm guitarist, his vocals got better later on, until the later 90's. Hammet is a good guitaris, no guitar god or anything...but he has what talent hes got, and uses it wisely. Jason is an excellent pick bassist though they wouldnt let him do much good bass work either when he was with them after all those years, neither cliff. Oh well people listen to their music, learn to play it and youll find out all for yourselves, metallica did pretty good though and is a good band wouldve been great if they had better bass playing.  Most people say you could hear their bass in all the songs with Cliff, yea right.  Then tell me where the other riffs are heard on other songs. Other then that, buy the album if your metalhead.
B00003CXXR|4.0|For fans of the original, this is a pretty good sequel. It has an interesting plot about a lost boy surviving on &quot;Dinosaur Island&quot;, and it brings back Sam Neill, who adds just the right touch of knowledgable fear (compared to the idiot &quot;tourists&quot; he's with.) I felt the gore level was less than the previous two movies, but the fear factor was just as great -- perhaps greater, due to the flying creatures in this episode.  We look forward to JP IV!
B00005RFAI|5.0|When we first heard Pink,we heard an R+B singer who had an awesome voice,cool video's,and pink colored hair.Now on her latest album we hear that same girl,but this time with a different tune.With M!ssundastood,Pink desided to change her music style.Instead of doing R+B/pop she is now singing rock music.This album shows off how awesome an artist Pink really is.Every song on this CD is amazing.M!ssundastood is definatly one of the best to come out in 2001.If you are looking for CD that has it all then look no further beacause here it is.Give it a try,you won't be disapointed.
B000002KLP|5.0|Dirty Mind is undoubtedly one of  Prince's best albums.  I won't dare make a definitive list of Prince's best albums, but this one will always rank among the top in my eyes.  <br />Dirty Mind- A funky opening to a great album<br />When You Were Mine- Arguebly one of Prince's best rock songs.  It's been covered by a ton of people, and  probably the only song on the album that can be heard on the radio.<br />Do It All Night- One of my favorite songs on the album.  The bassline is incredible!!!<br />Gotta Broken Heart Again- A nice little slow rock ballad.  <br />Uptown- A very funky track.  A wonderful song about his hometown.<br />Head- My favorite song on this album.  An extremely funky and dirty song about a virgin on her wedding night.  If &quot;Darling Nikki&quot; almost gave Tipper Gore a heart attack, this song may have killed her!!!  This is probably the best bassline that Prince has done.<br />Sister- A strange song of Incest.  This song shows Prince's sense of humor.<br />Partup- This is arguebly one of Prince's best closers.  A funky anti-war anthem that asks the question &quot;How you gonna make me kill somebody I don't even know&quot;? <br />This album is a must have for those who want to hear Prince has his nastiest, his funkiest, and his raunchiest.  He was only 22 when he recorded it, and it's a far cry from the Prince of today.  You cannot have a Prince collection unless you have this album.  <br />This album is just the begining of a ten year period in which the Lil' Purple One could do no wrong!!!

B00003CXRM|5.0|Great movie! There is something in this movie for everyone, haven't seen it yet?? Trust me you'll enjoy it very much!
0060977493|5.0|I was required to read this book for a writing seminar that I am taking.  I wish to apologize to the person who doesn't like this book because none of the characters are likeable.  A likeable character is not a qualification for an amazing read.  I've reread the book twice now and pick up on things that were pointed out in class but that I had not noticed.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes stories about true lives, about another culture which shouldn't be called exotic, and to anyone who wants to read something that will make them question their own beliefs about love laws in their own culture.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Everyone should own this. The greatest movies series ever!

B00003CXXI|5.0|Oh Geeze, where do i start! I could write about how muc i loved this movie and probably also quote everything word for word, but I wont. I Loved the Gingerbread man. I enjoyed the little song.(shine your shoes wipe your......face) I LOVED the donkey. Althoough I thought he should have ahd a name. I really liked how they made fun fo every fairy tale veer made! If you dont like this movie then you can &quot;eat me!&quot;
B00000ILDF|5.0|very much maligned upon its release, alien 3 is seen as the weaker of the 4 films by many fans of this franchise. i myself am  a fan of this movie and purchased it on dvd today [i write this review after watching it!]. i managed to pick this dvd up at a bargain price from a video rental outlet. <br />why this film was hated so much by critics and fans alike i will not know. each alien movie is unique in its own way and alien 3 is a total sidestep away from camerons classic aliens. many people expected the 'bang' 'bang' 'boom' 'boom' of its predecessor but instead david fincher decided to create his own vision using the same formula as the first alien movie.<br />commendable performances from the cast [charles dutton, ralph brown and brian glover] all compliment weavers performance excellently. like the first two movies there are some strong characters that we can identify and sympathise with. the script itself has some plot holes but that aside the film is a visual masterpiece with some breathtaking set designs which were way ahead of 1991 standards. easily the grimmest of the alien movies, fincher gave this movie a rather nihilistic undertone and it works great with the story.<br />the dvd transfer is very good, clear picture and the sound is also good with a few tweaks here and there over the vhs version. my only complaint was that this dvd has no real special features. we get a 25 minute 'making of' doc which is more like an overview to the making of the movie, there is no real depth. we get all 4 trailers to the alien movies. strange because alien3 had 3 trailers if i can remember...the one seen at the end of the documentary, the 'on earth we can hear you scream' trailer and the missing 'when the sun burns cold' trailer...no directors commentary which disappointed me. there were no tv spots either which was a shame.<br />i'm giving 5 stars to the movie...but on the features front i don't think it deserves any. alien and aliens had far better features and documentaries.
B000021XS0|5.0|Dream Theater's latest studio release is an absolutely stunning show of musicianship and has a lyrical quality few bands have rivaled. Each member of the band, though their parts differ so much, fit in together like pieces to a puzzle. After the legendary 9-minute prgressive rock &quot;prequel,&quot; Metropolis Pt. 1, Scenes has provided the follow-up DT fans have been awaiting since 1992's Images and Words. Following in the footsteps of band like The Who and Pink Floyd, this 77-minute concept album has shown that spectacular music isn't dead in an era of rap-metal fusions. Scenes is easily the best Studio album DT has released since 1989's When Dream and Day Unite, and that's saying something. The album's finale, Finally Free, has such a spectacular ending that I want to &quot;stand up and applaud,&quot; as one reviewer from RocRevue so appropriately stated.<br />Scenes, overall, also has the most diversity in musical style than has been shown in any DT album so far. John Petrucci sounds absolutely amazing on both acoustic and electric. Bassist John Myung sounds more like a guitarist than a bassist at times. Jordan Rudess, the band's new keyboardist, has shown a degree of musicianship the band has lacked on every studio album preceding this. James LaBrie's vocals are as impressive as they ever have been, while drummer Mike Portnoy further surpasses his previous successes in some of the most amazing rhythm parts I have ever heard.  The lyrics, overall, flow together perfectly, which is an amazing feat considering the album was written by four of the band's five members. Anyone who appreciates good musicianship and deep lyrics should give this album a look. I'm sure you will be as impressed as I was.
B00003CX5P|5.0|we all know about the movie, big film, mixed reviews etc etc.<br />i'm a star wars fan so naturally i loved this, TPM is a fun movie, its not supposed to convey any message, its not supposed to convey an ideal and its not a film that is to be taken seriously. its a fairy tale, pure entertainment.<br />the dvd is chock full of features, it took me 3 days to sift through and watch them all [i hadn't even watched the movie yet!]...this is easily the most feature laden dvd i have, and lucasfilm haven't just thrown a [lot of stuff] in there to fill up the second disc, we get an in depth look at how the film was made plus the featurettes as well which take the 'making of' documentary even further. theres the usual tv spots and trailers which were good and the duel of the fates music video which was also worth a look. the menu screens are beautiful, smooth animation and easy to use interface.<br />a must have for anyones dvd collection<br />the film: 5/5     the disc[s]: 5/5
B000001F6S|5.0|Astounding as Alvin was (and is) one has to remember that when Ten Years After first hit, there was no one--no one who could play like this.  And it took them all the way to Woodstock.<br />There were other fine players like Ritchie Blackmore and Clapton and some zeros like Pete Townsend but I gotta tell you, thirty years after, Undead is as fresh as Are You Experienced--and they did it live!  It doesn't just rock; it swings.<br />I played a show the other night and this young girl asked me  where I learned to play that fast--and still modulate over the chord changes.  I told her to pick up Undead.
6305910103|5.0|This is the best of the Star Trek movies bar none. Its the only one i will review as i would give them all a 5* rating and in truth this one is most likely the only one deserving of such (except maybe for III and IV). Khan is alive and on the loose. His heart is full of hate for Kirk and he will stop at nothing to destroy him and perhaps the universe as we know it. If you buy only one of the original crew Star Trek movies this is the one. Of course after this one Star Trek III The Search for Spock will be a must have as well.
B00005LOUQ|3.0|This movie is only okay, but the DVD deserves praise for one of its special features.  First, though, my review of the film: Although casting Jim Carrey as the Grinch is a stroke of genius, I have wondered ever since encountering the trailer for this live-action remake of the Dr. Seuss classic why Hollywood felt the need to try to improve on the book and the animated television show.  upon seeing the film, I can honestly say that this question hasn't been answered for me.  I give it high marks for Carrey's performance and the film's visual originality, but the film is basically an example of Hollywood trying to milk a classic for extra bucks.  This is particularly ironic, since the film's story line purports to be an outcry against the crass comercialization of Christmas.  I'm sure that neither Carrey, who utters a sermonette about said commercialization, nor the filmmakers turned down any of the money they made from it.<br />I am writing this review mainly because I want to send kudos to Universal Studios for partnering with Descriptive Video Service (DVS) to make the first fully accessible DVD.  Contrary to conventional wisdom, many of us who are blind have always loved movies, but in recent years our enjoyment of Hollywood products has been enhanced by the availability of narrated descriptions of a film's visual elements.  Heretofore available only through purchase directly from Descriptive Video Service of Boston and other providers, this feature has crept into select theaters on select releases and now finally onto a commercially sold DVD.  More importantly, Universal and DVS have made the DVD menu system accessible to those of us who can't read the screen by the use of voice prompts.  by the way, if you have a vision problem and weren't aware of these features when you bought this DVD, press 1 on your remote when the first menu screen comes up and you will enter the voice menu system.  this will also activate the narrated description if you play the movie or most of the DVD features from the voice menus.  I wish these features had been added to a better movie, but Universal and DVS have done a good job and I hope that Hollywood will take a cue from this release and start adding these accessories to other major releases, or at least the voice menus.
B00004RF9B|5.0|What a wonderful film. Great FX and an all star cast. Whats this? Is it the Enterprise transporter of Star Trek fame? Nope they are stasis chambers used for protection while entering the atmosphere of the Forbidden Planet. I see lots of things that would be familiar to star trek fans as well as a robot,a beautiful young girl and a force much different than anything used in sci-fi movies up to that point. Lots of far out sound FX and a feast for the eyes of a sci-fi fan. The DVD is of the highest quality and plays very well. One of the best!
B000000H3Z|5.0|Chances are most of you looking at reviews of this production are people who already own it, but are looking to find one another, the few and far between that still believe in this genre that for a very short period of time, put out music that was so much better than whats out there now, that its not even worth discussing.<br />Beneath the Remains was such an outstanding effort.  Max and Igor Calaveras were so tight, their style was virtually impossible to replicate early on, most of us wouldn't even try.  Arise was another outstanding album, but this one, well, its just too good to fully express in words.  The hammer ons and the speed they played at were almost secondary to the fact that they were like 16, still surviving in a very unpleasant area of Brazil, when this thing came out.
B00004ZD69|1.0|When I bought this Cd, i went in with an open mind.  I gave it a chance but i think it (is bad)!!  How big of an art nerd do I have to be to like this (...).  Please buy some new Cd's and do not listen to this(...)
6304698658|5.0|Just like every National Lampoon movie, this one does not dissapoint. As a matter of fact, I consider this movie to be a classic no doubt about this. this is something that you can enjoy with your family and your loved ones. Chevey Chase was hilarious. Most of the old people there seem to annoy me. Like the guy that burnt down the tree. And that crazy guy from Independence Day that flew the plane into the alien thing was on it too. I forget his name on the movie but he was funny too. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The best part was when Chevey was going crazy because he didnt get his bonus and he started to flip out on everybody. Then the guy kidnapped the boss and brought him to the house. It was pretty funny. The old lady saying the national anthem during grace was also funny. The ending was straight up hilarious. I can't tell you what happened because you need to get it for yourself to see. This is one of those movies that you must add to your collection. A definite &quot;MUST GET&quot;~!!
B00004Z459|5.0|This is the best CD ever!  My friend was talking to me about a band called Linkin Park.  He said he would let me listen to a song called \\"One Step Closer\\", so I listened.  I LOVED it.  I asked to listen to some more songs and let me listen to \\"Crawling, In The End, and Pushing Me Away.\\"  Once again I loved it. So I bought the CD and loved every song.  I Couldn't put it down.  I have 3 words for you: BUY THIS CD!
B00005RIKD|1.0|How does an exciting musician that has brought so much to the music industry become such a settled boring clone?  The only answer can be that money has changed the man.  And on a much louder note, how do his two sidkicks of Police become so unrecognized?  The answer is they are not, and with a little leap of faith, you will pick up OYSTERHEAD instead of this weak album.
630451087X|5.0|I hated this movie the first time I saw it.  Hated it!  It was so bad, that I rented it again to see if maybe I missed something.  And I still hated.  A year passes, I rented again.  I loved it.  I loved ever moment of it.  I cannot explain why, I just changed my opinion.  <br />Is it as good as Mulholland Drive? No.  But it works well as a build-up...some have even theorized that Mulholland is just a remake of Lost Highway.  I don't buy into that, but you can get a sense that Lynch was testing the waters with Dream-logic.<br />See it more than once.
6305508550|4.0|this is a very funny movie. this first time i watched it it didn't seem that funny, but then after i second time i loved it. milton is funny and so are all the other charcters. i don't have a job so i can't relate to that, but it is still a great movie.
B000009ED0|5.0|Kid Rock's best cd. It is great, includes singles such as I am the Bullgod, Cowboy, Bawitaba, and Only God Knows Why. It also has other good songs that any Kid Rock fan would love.
0385505833|4.0|Although the book is a bit predictable it was an easy read. It made me laugh at the things we do all for the sake of a holiday. I forgot all about holiday stress for a couple of hours.
0061008079|5.0|This book is a joy to read.  I found myself so enchanted by the characters that I read the book over and over again.  Wonderful traditional rags to riches girl stuff.
B000008H1R|5.0|I am very pleased to see the wonderful reviews of this record.  Twenty-eight years ago, when I was right in the middle of high school, I discovered the incredible Jethro Tull.  Such sublime alienation!  Such sweet melancholy!  This, and &quot;Stand Up&quot;, are my favorites from Ian Anderson &amp; band.  There is nothing like remembering rainy afternoons when I was 16, sitting in my room with poetry books, listening to this record -- identifying with Ian Anderson as the &quot;moody intellectual&quot;.  I have gone on to love all kinds of music, but these songs retain a unique place in my heart.  This recording is a time machine that can instantly take me back almost 30 years.  Extraordinary.
0930289528|5.0|Although comic creator Alan Moore published his groundbreaking Watchmen before V for Vendetta completed its run, V was his first work in what could be described as a related series of graphic novels, starting here, progressing to Watchmen, and concluding with From Hell (if, in fact, there is a &quot;conclusion.&quot;)  Moore's meditation on the nature of heros, good, and evil - in short, morality, justice, and everything we hold dear - begins here, with a strange, familiar, yet distant tale of the not-so-distant future.<br />England, 1997.  The US and the USSR have nuked each other back to the stone age, and England has been left to its own devices.  A fascist regime has assumed power with the will of the people, with the simple goal of England's continued existence - by whatever means necessary.  Unfortunately, a genetically-enhanced terrorist, dressed as Guy Fawkes, has been blowing up buildings and assassinating key members of the fascist government.  The story belongs to this terrorist, who calls himself (or herself) &quot;V&quot;, but it's really about the differences between heros, villains, good, and evil.<br />V kills people and destroys property - innocent people at that.  He does it in the name of Freedom, but the Fascist regime V fights against kills innocent people in the name of England's very survival.  Who's the terrorist here?  Who's good, and who's evil?  It's a fascinating question, and like any great artist/thinker, Moore doesn't provide an easy answer.  Were the American &quot;patriots&quot; who fought the British by destroying property and killing innocent people terrorists, especially in light of recent events?  Is terrorism and patriotism based on our perspective?  Is there any time at which fascism, and his twin sister, nationalism, can be excused because it will ensure the survival of a people?<br />Fascism and nationalism are based on emotional rather than logical thoughts, and V's quest for freedom by terrorism is no better.  Either way, arguments for fascism and the methods V employs to fight - indeed, the methods by which any &quot;patriot&quot; or &quot;terrorist&quot; fights against a government - are Utilitarian at best.  Is this suffecient to procure freedom?  Must we always abandon some degree of morality, cutting our losses and giving away our souls, to live &quot;free&quot; or &quot;survive?&quot;  It's something worth considering, and if anything will make you think about it, this brilliantly crafted, lavishly illustrated work of art will do just that.  Enjoy.arguments for fascism and the methods V employs to fight - indeed, the methods by which any &quot;patriot&quot; or &quot;terrorist&quot; fights against a government - are Utilitarian at best.

B00005QDW1|5.0|Out with the old, in with the &quot;New&quot; no pun intended. This new album is great. It blends &quot;No Doubt&quot; style with pop, dance, and rock. I rated it a 5, because I feel that not only the CD deserves it, but it's also an enjoyable atmosphere when you listen to it. Being a longtime No Doubt fan this is great to me, it doesn't top Tragic Kindom and Return of Saturn, yet instead it's right up their with them......
B00005BJ2O|5.0|This soundtrack is awesome! It has great songs that are both sad and happy, and they're sung by very talented people. :) I love<BR>the movie too.
B00005QCYC|5.0|As a former Jurassic Park fan, and loyal subject, I have waited an entire year (Oct 11th, 2000)(or, 391 days) for this boxed set. I knew it would happen, deep down, so I bit the bullet and endured these last 14 month's Jurassic Park-less. It was worth it.<br />The set includes Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Jurassic Park 3, and a fourth disc, &quot;Beyond Jurassic Park&quot;. What more could you want? Within these dvd's are nearly all the features you could want. But, Jurassic Park, and The Lost World are NOT dts. That is a bummer. I suppose I should have waited longer for the day when Universal becomes overstocked with the DTS Collector's Editions and start jamming them into the pack's. Oh well, I am really happy with the way these have turned out. All three feature pretty neat Animated Menus: (Menus spoiler ahead).<br />Menus:<br />For Jurassic Park you start with the drum and choir sound of the opening film (....a Universal picture....a Steven Spielberg film...Jurassic Park.) What you see is a swoop that goes from the Universal  emblem in outer space, then drops down at light speed to the Island of Jurassic Park - Isla Nublar. The soundtrack and jungle sounds continue as the pretty decent menu pop's up.<br />Lost world's is nearly the same, with the exception that the swoop goes down to the secret location of the surprise ending  (don't want to give to much away). Then you see the footprint of the t-rex on broken pavement accompanied by a flashing siren. You can hear the siren and people yelling in the background.<br />Jurassic Park 3 has the most unique menu of the bunch (but no complaints about the previous). You see scratchy metal covering the screen found in the JP3 symbol, followed by the snarling of a raptor. The raptor is behind the metal off screen. He (or she) tears three slashes in the back, revealing his eye watching you. He (or she) run's off, you glide through the slashes, and there is the menu. The raptor screams.<br />Beyond Jurassic Park's menu, I'll leave that for you to see.<br />Reviews:<br />Remaining as the longest running favorite movie of mine, Jurassic Park takes the cake. It is still great. I have intentionally not watched JP for the past 14 month's so the dvd would be all the more special. I knew I would never get an encore theatrical presentation (you know how spielberg is though, March 2002 is the re-mastered release of E.T.) so I have toughed it out to say, it was worth it. The picture is great and so is the sound (DD 5.1). (Be advised there was a recall earlier this year for the dts releases of JP and Lost World.) And like I said, I would have preferred dts, but when the raptors run at you in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround, you really don't care, because you will be too busy jumping from your seat to the floor and covering your head. Instruction's: Crank all the way up until you feel the heat from the t-rex's roar burning the hair off your neck.<br />There are many informative features that include the aspects of nearly every area of the Jurassic Park process. Included is &quot;The Making of Jurassic Park&quot;. I am so glad I didn't pay 12 buck's<br />when it came out a few years back on video. I wanted it bad, and it is well worth it, but its nice to know that the money I didn't spend went towards this set. My favorite features were the ameteur video shots from spielberg scoping out the Hawaiian islands for shooting locations. In one part he films some cows and says &quot;We could put some latex costumes on them and put them in the film&quot;. The cows run off. You can see him in the rearview mirror as he films with the video camera. Also, in another feature you see the production meeting's, in which Spielberg pops out idea's with a bunch of people that are...I won't say what I think about them. Anyway, in the meetings you hear him come up with several idea's that become the most important scenes in the film. Like, the t-rex attack. Yes, I have read the book, but the rex scene greatly differs between the book and film. As they discuss the scene, Spielberg plays with some toys in front of him. A woman (remaining nameless, cause I don't want to badger her) says to Spielberg, &quot;In the Rex scene we could have sparks shooting from the fence.&quot; He know's the story better, quickly replying &quot;The power is off.&quot; Fun stuff.<br />The Lost World has similar features, in fact it has the EXACT same theatrical trailers. (The reason is, these are the same disc's released in 0ct 2000, just crammed into the boxed set. And, this was before even a second of film was released for advertisement. So on JP and Lost World you get a trailer for 3 that is just some sound effects and glimpes of jungle.) You get The Making of The Lost World, and many informative features on the creation process. Such as, Using the Universal Parking garage for the trailer-dangling scene. (That was the best scene in the book, for me. Remember the battery acid dripping on Ian's shoulder? And the shard of glass?) Back to the film. The film itself have been hit hard, as a lousy sequal. Im not going to make any kind of offending statement on that remark. All I am going to do is say that Spielberg was rushed, and even so, did a good job with what pressures he had, you know, dealing with Julianne Moore. Anyway. It was made for the dino's and that's all there was to it.<br />Jurassic Park 3 was the chance for Joe Johnson to make a name for himself. One of my favorite film's, October Sky, had Johnson at the helm. The dvd is sharp as a tack, and the sound is YES,<br />DTS! Graphics are used to the fullest extent, and though I think the dino's in the original JP look just as good (and I am picky about such things) I will have to say, bravo. Included is the Jurassic Park 3 trailer that differs tremendously from the one found on the other disc's. During the time I waited (8 month's) for it to come out, I watched the trailer for jp3 more times (on the net) than any other preview.<br />Beyond Jurassic Park bridges the gap for extra's, giving no doubt of Universal's desire to show the fan's how Jurassic Park, The Lost World, and Jurassic Park 3 were made. It is fun, and informative, and will surprise you. There were effects done in these movies that you might not have even known were effects. Remember the scene in which Lex (Ariana Richardson) falls through the panel on the ceiling and the raptor jumps up to snatch her? That's not her, its a stunt double with Lex's face digitally imposed onto her's! Lot's of good stuff.<br />A split decision between critics and audiences about the quality plot-wise is kind of rediculous, because ALL of the Jurassic Park films are for fun, and not examination. That's like breaking a toy to see how it works. It just does!<br />(Side note: A magazine that shall remain nameless claimed that there was an improper touching between a child and adult in Jurassic Park. The scene, again is when Lex falls through the panel. Grant grabs her by the upper leg, with Ellie, to pull her back up before the raptor chews her to bits. Ebert says it best, &quot;Being eaten by a raptor ranks high on my list of inappropriate touching.&quot; When I read that I nearly fell out of the chair laughing.)  ~S.A.O.S.~etween the book and film.

0380973650|5.0|This is a brilliantly dark and moving tale of love and devotion.<br />The central idea is that gods who are worshipped as ominoptent actually need the belief of their followers to survive.  When mankind immigrated to America (and Gaimon speculates that there has been a thriving ancient trade and immigration in America long before recorded history), they brought their belief in their Old World gods along with their hopes and dreams.  America is a difficult land for gods, however, as their followers rapidly assimmilate into mainstream America.  Money and technology are what many modern Americans worship, and old gods are now threatened by new gods- Internet, Media, Automobiles, and Credit.  The old gods, who have degenerated into mundane careers like supermarket clerks and funeral home directors, must now fight for their survival.<br />This is where a young American named Shadow Moon comes into the tale.  Shadow is co-opted into the divine struggle when he meets an elderly con artist named Mr. Wednesday who seems to know too much about Shadow's life.  Wednesday offers him a well paying, dangerous job, which Shadow takes, believing he has no future.  A reformed prison convict, Shadow was looking forward to a new start.  Days before his release, Shadow's beloved wife, Laura, dies in a car accident under very unexpected circumstances. Shadow soon finds out that his employer is the American incarnation of the Norse god, Odin.  Odin and Shadow embark on a bizarre road trip across America, encouraging a very interesting group of displaced &quot;American Gods&quot; to unite.  Through the story Shadow, Odin and their allies are pursued by destructive modern gods.<br /> Shadow also repeatedly encounters the reanimated corpse of Laura.  What could be a macabre ghost story instead turns sadly touching as Shadow and Laura try to deal with what happened and come to closure.<br />The story has an amazing plot twist, though Gaimon gives several clues to what will happen. I liked the characterizations- even minor characters have depth and believability. For example, Odin is not entirely a grim god.  He has a sense of humor and chases (often successfully) after Nordic girls.  Laura turns out having a pivotal role in the story.  Shadow, however, is the most complex character.  Initially he seems like the big and stupid, strong and silent type.  He is actually very intelligent, perceptive and compassionate.  As the story develops, he realizes he has more power and courage inside of him than he ever realized.<br />Mr. Gaimon's views of the oddities and charms of American small towns and roadside attractions are very accurate.  I also enjoy that Mr. Gaimon focused mainly on the rural Midwest, Great Plains and the South, including a Wisconsin town spookily like the one where I went to college (which had a contest with a car on a frozen lake). The Interludes showing how various immigrants brought their belief in Old World gods and magical beings to America are also intriguing (I especially like the idea that Vikings discovered America some 200 years before Leifur Eiriksson).<br />I agree in theory with the comments that this book would make a smashing film, especially if Mr. Gaimon could write the script and you had a director who could present American culture with Mr. Gaimon's affectionately quirky view.  My one fear would be that the film would focus too much on the macabre aspects of the book instead of on the compassion and dignity that underlies these macabre scenes.<br />All in all, a very beautiful book and, honestly, one of the bestI read this year.the characterizations- even minor characters have depth and believability.

6304436386|5.0|it's not that he isn't a great kid actor. the scene where he was first abandoned in A.I. really moved me to tears.<br />but a 11-year-old natalie portman is really something else...<br />as matilda, the suddenly-orphaned child trying to hide youth, vulnerability and desperate need to be loved under a cigarette-smoking tough-as-nails exterior, she moved me to tears even as she's making me laugh my sides out.<br />i would have forgotton completely she was a child if not for the fact she's so terribly tiny.<br />my favorite scene (and believe me in this movie it's hard to choose just one) is the one where matilda and leon are playing a game of guess who. it's a small, yet effective snippet of the affection between two people trying to find love, friendship &amp; belonging where they can.<br />it's a delicate and fiercely intelligent movie, even though there is none of the high concepts and caustic verbal repartee so common in the so-called &quot;intelligent&quot; movie genre.<br />at the heart of this movie is two great actors (notice the lack of &quot;child-actor&quot; qualification) and a simple story, incredibly well-told.
B000002KK2|5.0|One of the top blues/pop recordings on the market, a must have
B00004XONN|1.0|For all their hype ... I don't get it.<BR>I bought it, gave it one listen and thought &quot;how boring was that!?!&quot;<BR>Took it back the next day and traded it in for another CD.<BR>Mind you, I own almost 500 CD's and just as many vinyl albums and I don't get the Radiohead craze. I been told you &quot;have to&quot; see them live. I don't doubt it cause I've seen many a band that are absolutely fantastic live but don't come across well in studio. Must be the case for these guys cause they do nothing for me. Oh ... and then there is the song National Anthem on this CD. Finally a song that sounded worthwhile .... until they totally screwed it up with noise and horns and chaos. I felt like punching out the bandmates for ruining a great song. I wanted to like this band but, no can do.
B00000K0YC|5.0|No CD comes with a 100% satisfaction guarantee, but the first minute or so of &quot;St. Thomas&quot; -- with Max Roach setting up the calypso beat on his toms and then Sonny coming in on sax -- is about as close as it gets.  What a perfect introduction to Sonny Rollins, and maybe jazz in general.  &quot;St. Thomas&quot; is the most memorable performance here, due to the insanely catchy melody, but the other tracks are equally rewarding.  &quot;You Don't Know What Love Is&quot; is a superb reading of the ballad.  &quot;Moritat&quot; (better known as &quot;Mac the Knife&quot;) swings along leisurely while &quot;Strode Rode&quot; chugs along at a more hectic pace.  And &quot;Blue 7&quot; is a blues (obviously) that allows all four musicians to stretch out.  The two guys that really shine here are Sonny and Max Roach, but you can't forget Tommy Flanagan's always-tasteful piano and Doug Watkin's tight bass playing.  Saxophone Colossus is one of the first jazz CDs a jazz newbie should hear (preferably in the crystal-clear 20 bit remaster), and if you like it pick up Sonny's Way Out West as well.
B00003CXN4|1.0|Could be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. After paying to see this movie, I felt ripped off.  This experience is like watching a 2 hour commercial. The movie left me feeling insulted and very disappointed. I have yet to meet anyone that saw this that actually liked it. Don't assume it is good just because of the hype and the actors.
6305499365|5.0|This movie both entertained me and and..made me depressed. Instead of Peter being in a office,imagine him as the computer guy/setup guy in a factory and you have my life circa 1999. This movie actually encouraged me to go out and change careers. I feel his pain.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Good Job!!  I really enjoyed this movie.  I waited to see it when it was released on DVD.  I thought it well worth the wait.  After reading so many reviews in the papers and listening to reviews on tv I did not know what to expect.  They did not do justice to this movie.  I usually find the movies with the worst reviews, are the ones that I enjoy the best.  I'm 50 years old and I have been enthused about Pearl Harbor since I was in junior high school.  The acting by all the actors was very good.<BR>I enjoyed the comedy, the romance, the action and also, the way they showed both sides of the attack.  It showed true friendship between two life long friends, and no matter what, they remained friends.  I have lent the DVD to a few of my friends and have heard nothing but praise for it.  I can't wait to get it back and watch it again.  Thank you for letting me express my opinion.
0671024256|4.0|This is a strangely uneven but very entertaining book.<BR> The first half of &quot;On Writing&quot; is entirely autobiographical. King tells you all about his childhood and his early years as a struggling writer. While these recollections are endearing and informative for the truly curious, any gonzo King fan will already know most of this stuff, especially if he/she has read Danse Macabre or Spignesi's The Complete Stephen King Encyclopedia. You'll get a feel for what types of things (small town life, teaching school, substance abuse, poverty, the pulps, etc.) inspired King's incredible fiction, but after about fifty pages of this you'll be thinking &quot;O.K., Stevie, but how do you become a GOOD WRITER?&quot;<br /> On this point, he doesn't fail to deliver in the second half of the book. Stephen doesn't pull any punches...you have to get serious and down to business when it comes to writing if you feel as if this is your life's calling. You can't procrastinate...write WHEN EVER and WHERE EVER possible, with (as King would say) the DOOR SHUT (forget about the conventions of the genteel &quot;literary establishment&quot; and TELL THE TRUTH as you see it). The work ethic is everything, really. As the Master says in Danse Macabre: &quot;If you do anything for long enough you'll get good at it&quot;. King has a passion for story telling, and he's convinced that the only way a person can become a successful writer is if writing (in and of itself, the very creative process) is an ecstatic experience. If it isn't, and you're only into becoming a professional writer to get rich or to get laid, you will not create literary works of genius (you may still get rich and &quot;scribble your way into mansions in the Carribean&quot; like Danielle Steele and similar hacks, but you will not bring forth works that will be remembered thirty years from now). In other words, if you would rather be washing the car or looking at internet porn right now instead of writing a story, literary fortunes are not in your future.<br /> King's technical points are helpful (&quot;eliminate ALL unnecessary words!&quot; and avoid schmaltzy adverbs--&quot;swifties&quot;, King calls them--like the plague, among others) and he advocates a very clean writing style, chanting his mantra of &quot;second draft=first draft minus 10%&quot; over and over again. Also, (here's the work ethic again) he stresses the importance of magazines for the aspiring fiction writer...get your foot in the door and get some stories published (even if they're in rags like Juggs or Swank and the payoffs are like $25.00 and free copies) so you have some writing credits when you're looking for a publisher for your first novel.<br /> One last thought...King's reading list (at the end of the book) left me scratching my head. Not a single one of the authors in his list are horror writers, but they are authors who King finds impressive in terms of technical skill (Graham Greene, Barbara Kingsolver, John Steinbeck, J.K. Rowling, Joyce Carol Oates, many others). O.K., so I want to be a fantasy/horror writer like King himself...I suppose I'll have to read Danse Macabre yet again to catch some of his tips for this specific genre. No biggie.<br /> He is the Master of contemporary horror fiction, the heir of Poe and Lovecraft, so I think I'll keep this book on my desk for inspiration for all those times that I start to feel frustrated and discouraged in my own writing labors. In short...WRITERS, buy it...CASUAL FANS, read HEARTS IN ATLANTIS or PET SEMATARY instead.
B00005U18E|3.0|Perhaps I should have watched the movie first and then read the book, maybe I would have enjoyed this movie more if I had done that.  In any event, the movie did not come close to the fun &amp; hilarity that the book contained.  There was an incredible amount left out of the movie which, in my opinion, didn't necessarily have to be left out.  The movie almost turned into a completely different story, despite the close resemblance to the book at the beginning.  I probably would have enjoyed this movie if I hadn't already read the book, but if I hadn't read the book then I would have missed out on a whole lot of fun.  This movie was seemingly well made &amp; not a complete waste of time.  Renee Zellwinger played a good part, but it just wasn't the same as reading about Bridget Jones.  If you have the time, I highly suggest the book...it is much better.
0380817683|5.0|I can relate so much with this book in many ways.  I highly recommend this book for any twenty-something woman who is struggling to find out her place in the world.  It really tells you about the typical 27 year old female in todays world:  neurotic (in some ways), lost and trying to find your place and way in this world.  It shows you that you can love yourself once you find out who you are and its okay to be alone and self sufficent.
B00005QK3W|2.0|Think back and remember how great the album's \\"Band On The Run\\", \\"Tug Of War\\" and Venus and Mars were and then listen to Paul McCartney's latest cd \\"Driving Rain\\" and try to convince yourself that this is some kind of a great 5 star album? The cd is full of typical uninspired love song syrup that Paul is famous for. The song \\"From Lover To Friend\\" and \\"Heather\\"[we are forced to listen to a song about his fiancee, how exciting?] are prime examples of his latter day music that is boring and uneventful. The bonus add on track \\"Freedom\\", was introduced at the \\"Concert For New York\\", and quickly added on to the cd before it's release date in an effort to generate interest and hopefully boost sales of this lackluster cd. I guarantee you will see plenty of copies available at your local used cd shop shortly! That's where this ones going! Maybe at the age of sixty, paul has run his creative course? Buy his \\"Wingspan\\" collection which is an all you need fantastic career retrospective and pass on \\"Driving Rain\\".
6304698798|5.0|I've been a fan of Westerns since a young girl in the late 1970s.  It was The Good, The Bad and The Ugly which first peak my interest in Westerns and even today, there's nothing like a western to end a perfect evening.  The trio of Eastwood (Blondie), Wallach (Tuco) and Van Cleef (Angel Eyes) makes this western a true classic and one of the must see westerns of all time.  It's brilliantly written, acted and loaded with suspense.  If you want to see one of the best, I consider The Good, The Bad and The Ugly on the top of my list.
B00005ATQM|3.0|I'm commenting here on the DVD-Audio version of the \\"Black Album,\\" originally released as a 1991 CD. The record labels seem to think that the way to introduce DVD-Audio surround sound is to re-issue old, mega-selling albums remixed for surround. I'm not sure if that makes sense. To be sure, this is a fine record that brought Metallica increased, widespread recognition. But something about this classic lineup of guitars, bass, drums and vocals seems rooted in having most sounds emerge from a frontal, stereo spread. The material feels inherently stereo; somehow you know if these guys were planning 5.1 surround from the start, the arrangements would differ. The new mixes are relatively conservative, but there are some interesting sounds and occasional guitar solos that appear in the surround channels. The sound is reasonably good, but not outstanding. It's the nature of this material to not have the pristine clarity that would show off the high resolution of DVD-Audio.  Also included on this release are stereo versions, a brief video about making the Black Album, and credits. The lyrics are available on screen, but must be manually advanced.

B00003CXSP|3.0|The script of this movie will make you keep saying: &quot; what the ----'s she doing&quot; cause she keep trying to save him that made her really stupid in handling a cannibal who is listed on &quot;fbi's top 10 most wanted&quot; don't you think so? the city sets are really nice on the screen, directing stuff is great too, but i there's something that doesnt make sense too about why there wasnt any blood drip from ray's head meanwhile hannibal already cut the forehead and only covered it with a hat??? btw this is quite a shocking &amp; gory movie, and they should make the trilogy with different cool setting, and probably they both should fall in love each other? -lol-
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Incredible movie. The acting was good, not Oscar material, but not average either, and better than most pure action movies. The sceneries were breathtaking, incredible. The directing fantastic. There was understated humor and fast fast action that left one almost breathless.<br /><br />At first I had reservations about Angelina being Lara Croft, but after watching the DVD, all reservations went out the window. She was born to play this role. Angelina did her own stunts, thank you very much, which adds more to the film (no having to pull back shots with a double).<br /><br />Yes, Angelina did an accent, it wasn't a heavy one, or a stereotypical one where you could say \\"it's welsh for sure\\" or \\"it's Scottish for sure\\".. but you know, I know in reality many people in this melting pot world where their accents are not very clear as to what accent it is they have. That's reality. She did a great job with it and made it seem more real to me (than some heavy-handed accent, or some too perfect accent, or some stereotypical accent). I could understand every word she spoke.<br /><br />And maybe the one reviewer was too focused on Angelina's great body and so didn't noticed that there really was a plot. Not a deep, filled with twists and undercurrents and many subtexts plot, but a good plot, one that actually did have some subtexts and some thought-provoking aspects to it, if one was willing to look for it. The movie has, then, layers to it, like a good archaeological dig :-). Having said that, yes, the plot wasn't a 5* plot, but sheesh, do they all need to be? Diversity is great, and sometimes a decent average plot with some INCREDIBLE action and scenery (and not just Angelina scenery) is a very good thing. One does not live off of Shakespeare alone.<br /><br />For those who say the camera was too much on Angelia (as if that could be possible &lt;grin>) were either not watching the movie I was watching, or that they were so captivated by her that they didn't notice the incredible landscapes and panoramas that were presented to them. That's not the fault of the movie that some viewers are feeling guilty for gawking at Angelina so much that they couldn't tell you what the movie was about or that there were some fabulous direction going on with the photography. Is it wrong to have a beautifully photographed movie have a beautifully photographed star? Not in my book. This movie is a must see, must have, must buy.at were presented to them.

B000002QWD|5.0|Bing Crosby, as one reviewer has written is Mr. Christmas. Ever since I was 7, listening to the LP of my Grandmothers, and now I'm 24, I've enjoyed Mr. Crosby's voice. Listening to White Christmas puts me into the holiday mood.<br />All of the songs, Bing gives a reverance to each track: <BR>Adeste Fideles, always gives me a warm feeling as Bing sings each line. Faith Of Our Fathers, God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman, also gives that reverence of Faith and Joy.<br />My all time favorite, Christmas In Killareny, a nice Irish Christmas tune, very upbeat and happy, makes me think of the early 1930's when Bing sang this, if only Christmas where like this...<br />And in this year, after all that has happened, Bing's songs have a new meaning, and joy and hope that we look to....<br />Merry Christmas all!!!!
B00005RFVL|5.0|IF you ever thought Robbie was lacking of talent...yes there are those people out there, I am not one. But if you did, this will totally change your thoughts, completly! Even if I did not like him I would still say the same! This album is amazing! I will be honest, I downloaded several songs off the ablum, and was so impressed I actually bought the REAL thing! Check www.amazon.co.uk it should still be about 16 bucks with shipping! (for us)! so you save some money there! I have seen portions from his Albert hall video. If you order this be aware it is in PAL which is differnt from us forats....still Vhs...it just differnt (easist way to explain it). There are stores throughout the us...especially CA and Los Angeles that can convert it for you!...the DVD is region 2--for Asia and Europe so if you get it make sure your DVD machine is multi-region, or can read other regions!<BR>This album is so good it is surely a Grammy contedndor, if they officially release in the us! I think the us fans need to start a petition for the release of it here!<BR>mr. banjangles, one for my baby, are amazing!<BR>True, he is not Sinatra, but he has class, a great voice and brings some of his own style! for a laugh listen to \\"They Can't Take That Away From me\\"...a duet with Rupert Evert. It's great--but the two with their comedic timing and talents have fun with this song!
B000002AS3|5.0|What else is there to say? Before all the commercial success, unnecessary hype and unhealthy agitation around the band, this little gem rocked my stereo. Much less Beatles-influenced than their second album this one is also much more electric, filled with Noel's pentatonic solos, repetitive but fun, and cool seventies-sounding riffs. Anyhow, in my opinion, Oasis hasn't been able to surpass this LP yet and probably won't ever be able to. Start your collection here.
B0000029LG|5.0|HIStory is a very great album released by Michael in 1995. I love almost every song on the second disc.<BR>Scream, They Don't Care About Us, Tabloid Junkie, 2 Bad and HIStory are so powerful and energetic songs that few artists could reach the high standard.<BR>Stranger In Moscow, You Are Not Alone, Childhood and Smile and Little Susie are very good ballads.<BR>Earth Song is undoubtedly an excellent song totally different from Heal The World.<BR>I don't really like D.S. and Money, though the two songs are still not bad, especially taking into account of the rap on Money.<BR>HIStory is the best track on the album.  Artistically Michael peaks with the song. The song mixes pop, rap, classical (Pictures in Exhibition) while speaking out Michael's personal strong will (Don't Let no one get you down, keep moving on higher ground). If Michael had released the song with a video according to the lyrics, it would have reached number one around the world (with the exception of the U.S., as Michael sings &quot;How many victims must there be, slaughter in vain across the land (&quot;A Land from which I Came&quot; as sung on the song &quot;They Don't Care About Us&quot;) while pointing at the U.S. flag during the HIStory tour).  Michael's hidden anger with the U.S. is fierce after the devastating experience in 1994 and the flopping sales of HIStory in 1995.<BR>I wish Michael hadn't done a cover on Come Together.  He should include a new song, though this one seems suitable to divide the second disc into two parts.<BR>I also wish Michael had released a two-disc HIStory with ALL new tracks.  His fans already has all his past 4 excellent albums!  It seems that Michael dared not to take the risk considering all the controversies at that time!  I really thought Michael would release an album titled HIStory to give an account of his life!  So I was a bit disappointed when hearing disc 1!  And now the Greatest Hits Vol 1 has released!<BR>The album has sold more than 14 million copies around the world (28 million albums).  With the exception of the United States (also more than 3.5 million copies).  If the sales of Blood On the Dance Floor / HIStory In the Mix (500 million copies) is included, the HIStory series has sold more than 33 million albums around the world!  Who could say Michael's HIStory is a commercial and artistic failure?  Michael even turns into a new style of music on HIStory continues!  HIStory is an incredible success!
B000002J1U|5.0|Now there's been a lot of negative reviews for this LP when it came out (see Rolling Stone) and ever since. Most complaints were related to the fact that after the first two hard-rockin' albums this one was a 80% acoustic piece, very much inspired by celtic folk sounds. Well, I consider it some of Page and Co's best work. LZ III is never quite what you expect and you never listen to it the same way twice. The record kicks off with blitzkrieg riffs of Immigrant Song and typically zeppellinesque Celebration day (let's not forget track 2 'Friends'). N.4 'Since I've been loving you' is one of the major gems on this record and in my opinion the most powerful Led Zep blues ever. The album is worth buying even if it was only for that song. But it gets better, unleashing Page's acoustic power with four classic Zep tracks: Gallows Pole, Tangerine, Bron-y-aur Stomp and That's The Way (recently on Cameron Crowe's 'Almost Famous' soundtrack). It would probably take me a thousand words each to describe these songs so my advice is go out and get it, whether you're starting a LZ collection or you just want to listen to some excellent acoustic rock.
B00005QDW5|5.0|First, I'll admit that the editing of some of the songs (Echoes &amp; Marooned) seems terrible, but in the context of the collection and the sequence these songs play out, it is superb!<BR>Marooned is a great filler between 'Hey You' and 'Great Gig In The Sky'.  <br />I couldn't disagree more with others who propose a second 'best of'.  Despite excluding pieces from 'Atom Heart Mother' and the two soundtracks (More &amp; Obscured by Clouds) this set is nearly perfect! <br />I do have one complaint, 'Welcome To The Machine' is missing.  Although that would have made this collection very lopsided (nearly the entire 'Wish You Here' recordings). Oh well!<br />After listening to this masterpiece dozens of times I find myself with an actual favorite song, 'Learning To Fly' (sorry Roger).<br />If you want more 'Dark Side Of The Moon' check out 'Pulse'.  The entire record is played live.  'The Wall' speaks for itself.<br />If you're new to Floyd I also recommmend 'Meddle' and the before mentioned Soundtracks.  'Atom Heart Mother' will give you a taste of what was to come (Dark Side Of The Moon).<br />Nuff Said!
B00005QIPH|1.0|Hype is such a sorry monster for a band to live up to, cause no matter how good you actually are, you will never be as good as your hype. Well the Strokes are no exception to this rule. Listening to the Strokes debut reminds me of what &quot;dire straits&quot; the state of rock and roll is currently in. The British and now American press have gladly become the Strokes lapdogs, reaching for any little piece of rock and roll they can sniff, and calling it the &quot;second coming&quot;. Well, I certainly didnt hear any &quot;second coming&quot;, what I heard was an indie rock bands basement demos that meander and graze like sheep on a hillside. Television, Velvet Underground and even Jonathan Richman And The Modern Lovers have been thrown out to describe the Strokes. To my ears they sound more like a late 80's Homstead comp track by some band from Topeka KS that you never hear from again, until years later when you come across their only cassette release in the cut out bin at Camelot,(Green on Red, Phantom Tollbooth anyone?) you buy it for old times sake and when you get it home you remember why you didnt get it back in 87. I can neither predict or know what is to become of The Strokes, but if I were giving them advice I would tell them to invest, and maybe consider rehearsing grocery bagging insted of guitar tuning (which they havent quite mastered yet) Hey that is honest work, kids.
B000001EGA|5.0|And the only album of theirs that truly qualifies as art...<br />The tunes are Elton's best, and Taupin's poetry is flawless. &quot;From the ends of the earth to your town...&quot; &quot;We watched the arrested get taken away...&quot; &quot;And just like us, you must have had, your once upon a time...&quot;<br />In this album Taupin equalled Dylan and John equalled Lennon/McCartney. So buy it, you fool. What are you waiting for?
0385505833|4.0|I received this as a gift and I am NOT a Grisham fan but I truly enjoyed this book. It was written in the spirit of Christmas.
6305718954|5.0|This movie surprised me, I watched it twice before I had to return it in the morning.  Weeks later I had to pick up my own copy.<br />A great Religious Thriller.  If you liked the Omen (way back when...), or more reciently the Prince of Darkness - then you'll love this movie!
0385505833|4.0|It's a wonderful book, you really must allow yourself to read it.<br />Taking issue w/ other reviewers who gave this one star, here I quote, &quot;One of the things that stood out to me was the fact that main characters were running to a tanning booth before their cruise - but on the other hand the father was afraid that his daughter's Peruvian boyfriend was dark skinned.&quot;<br />If you don't find this idea offensive then don't read it... in a few years your humor will mature, and then you can enjoy.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|I found Tomb Raider most dissipointing, but then I didn't expect too much either.<br />This movie made the Mummy look like very good Non-Fiction...  The single bright spot was the sound.  They made good use of the Surround Sound, the main motivator for me renting this movie (to test out my new home theater set-up).<br />If you can't stay clear of this movie, rent it first and save yourself a couple bucks!
0385505833|1.0|The only reason I gave this book 1 stars is because it was light reading.<br />It's amazing that you can put Grisham's name on a book and throw a title into it with the word &quot;Christmas&quot;...release it after Thanksgiving, and lo and behold...it's a best seller!<br />Who said marketing is dead in America?? Very dull book that could have been written by my 14 year old!
B000005IU2|4.0|Although the Stooges' self-entitled debut was probably more venomous than anything released in 1969, it could not possibly prepare listeners for the all-out brutality of  1970's Funhouse. Whereon the debut, producer, John Cale, attempted to mold the band into something somewhat listenable, Funhouse's producer, Don Gallucci, keeps a liaise faire approach to the Stooges' jaggedness. Whereon the debut, leadsinger, Iggy Pop, echoed typical youthful angst, on Funhouse he becomes some sort of rock and roll beast. Where his sex drive was once portrayed as awkward and impatient, his urges become forceful and destructive on songs like \\"Down On the Street\\" and \\"Loose.\\" Where he once seemed eccentric and apathetic, he now sounds fiercely paranoid and aggressive on songs like \\"TV Eye\\" and \\"Dirt.\\" Whereon the debut, the band's sound was thumping and driving, on Funhouse it is swift and viciously. Approach it if you dare. But be warned that Funhouse features the most savage, feral rock band of them all, truly thrashing with all their glorious might.
B00005QXDD|5.0|As a huge fan of Jack Black, when I first saw this album in the stores I picked it up immediately.  I was not disappointed.  It's very funny, but also it's pretty musical.  Black has a good voice, and songs like &quot;Wonderboy&quot; prove this.  There are several hilarious skits of comedy throughout also.  I recommend this to anyone who is not easily offended by sick humor!
B000005IU1|4.0|Before Nirvana, before the Misfits, before the Clash, the Sex Pistols, the Ramones and the rest of the so-called first wave of punk rock, the Stooges originally used thrashy rock and roll to epitomize average young angst. It not an overestimation to say that every distressed grunge rocker, raging metal head and disenfranchised punk can trace his or her roots back to the Stooges' eponymous debut, an album that was woefully misplaced in the idealistic, flower power era. With the exception of the faulty artrork endeavor, \\"We Will Fall,\\" every moment of the 1969 LP surges with the rage of pent-up, unruly youngsters. Lead singer, Iggy Pop, takes the role of a ...everyman, tunelessly wailing about awkward sex drive (\\"Not Right\\" \\"Real Cool Time\\"), youthful apathy (\\"No Fun,\\" the pounding, perfect anthem \\"1969\\") and misplaced passion (\\"Ann\\" \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog,\\" which is likely the most frighteningly forceful song of devotion ever recorded). The band backs his idiosyncratic frenzy with thumping drumbeats; sling-shotting, quasi-psychedelic guitar riffs and a generally, delightfully rough sound. This was an approach and a sound so revolutionary that it reverberated through the Woodstock era, inspired the countless disenfranchised youths who became the punk movement in the mid-seventies and continues to echo today. True, bitter teens and twenty-somethings would have likely used music as an outlet even without the Stooges. But Iggy and company should be accredited for founding the style by which so many of them did.
B000003TA4|5.0|since my other review of this album was so short and plain i decided to write another one analizing the entire CD, this time i hope you like it!<BR>    <BR>1) Smells Like Teen Spirit: A+ this song is the most well known songby Nirvana and is very well written and has great musical skill put into it. Great way to start off their cd.<BR>2) In Bloom: A  this song is a great Nirvana song in general. It has a great solo, like all of their work, and has pretty good lyrics. Yet again another good song.<BR>3) Come As You Are: B+ ok, i try to look at everything from different points of view. This song has excellent vocal power but the actual music is a little plain. On the 3rd day of guitar lessons i could play the entire thing through.<BR>4) Breed: B-  this song can get a little on your nerves if youre not in th right mood<BR>5) Lithium: A+++ Best song on theentire album!<BR>6) Polly: B  A ittle too morbid but still solid all the way through<BR>7) Territorial Pissings: A  funny and vividly describes the way Cobain want thingso be and how things were in his life.<BR>8) Dain You: A  great lyrics and very unique solo.<BR>9) Lounge Act: A Cobains mutters the F word in this song! a rarity for nirvana!<BR>10) Stay Away: B-  the song was very good but the thing that brought it down was one of the last lines when Cobain says something Negative about God, however, i like to thik f it as Cobain calling God happy<BR>11) On A Plane: A+  nice song with good lyrics and a very happy sense in it, another rarity for Nirvana<BR>12) Something In The Way: A   very mellow slow song that describes Cobains life &quot;Underneath the bridge&quot;<BR>13) Endless,nameless: A+++++ anpther favorite on this album. this is the hidden 13th track on the (selected) album(s). i do believe that nirvana was 1 of the first bands to feature a hidden track on their albums. very verygood track with ear spliting heavy feedback! if you buy the album for any reason do it for the hope of getting this song on it!<br />Very good album a must have for any self respected music fan!
B000003S0Z|4.0|The last album from sonic experimenter, Brian Eno's pop period, 1977's Before and After Science, incorporates elements from each of the previous works from that stage of his career. The album's first side features funky, glam rock oddities, like to those of 1973's Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy and Here Come the Warm Jets, such as the instantly addictive as \\"Backwater\\" and the eerie, idiosyncratic \\"No One Receiving.\\" Side B recalls Eno's 1975 masterpiece, Another Green World, with a ghostly, serene soundscapes of interconnecting songs, the best of which are the mournful \\"Here He Comes\\" and the gorgeously icy \\"By This River.\\" After this album, Eno would expand his experimentation further and further, founding ambient music and appealing only to the a select group of music fans. Before and After Science is a good example of when Eno used his monstrous creativity to put fresh spins on more conventional song structures.
B0000028RR|5.0|great CD! GET THIS CD I LOVE IT U WILL 2! the only good &quot;Rap Metal&quot; band out there!
B000002HNR|4.0|I noticed that Amazon customers who purchased Absolutely Live are noted as also buying obscure Doors albums, such as The Ceremony Continues, an interview disc and An American Prayer, a posthumous recording of the Doors backing Jim Morrison's spoken word material. I hope that it is not only total diehards who are interested in the Doors live. While it is understandable why live material is consumed by acolytes only for most bands, a good documentation of their dynamic live show is necessary to truly get a feel for the Doors. The band's smoky mix rock, jazz and blues is brought to entirely new dimensions onstage. Jim Morrison takes his place as a bold, provocative neo-beat poet more assuredly before a live audience, (Note \\"the Celebration of the Lizard King,\\" the saga that takes up tracks 14-20 of Absolutely Live). The band's arrangements take their most delightfully loose and wavy form. The songs are blended together in shifting, spiraling medleys such as the tease of \\"the Soft Parade,\\" leading into \\"Dead Cats, Dead Rats,\\" which transforms into \\"Break On Through.\\" And songs such as \\"Back Door Man\\" and \\"Soul Kitchen,\\" which are only adequate on the LPs, mushroom to life. Although they released fine studio LPs, there were some heights the Doors only reached onstage. A good account of their stageshow (and Absolutely Live is a very good one), is necessary to fully absorb this mysterious, magnificent band.
0783231482|5.0|The Blues Brothers are my role models for coolness under<BR>pressure and single minded goal pursuit.<br />I cannot believe that noboby was hurt in the amazing police<BR>car pileups.
B00004X01U|5.0|After Like a Prayer, this is Maddy's BEST album.  It is much more entertaining than the over done Ray of Light.  While listening to the first 3 songs, I GUARANTEE that you will get up and start dancing, or if you are driving you will start boogying in the car.  It is such a cool album with so much cool music and sounds.  Ray of Light lagged on for over an hour, and excet for Candy-Perfume Girl (which is about Date Rape), it almost put me to sleep.  Yes Madonna we know you are famous and blah blah blah, yeah go ahead make a album about spirituality...  I am so glad she followed up Ray of Light with Music, or I would have stopped liking her.  The only complaint I have about this album is that it is too short!  She should have put American Pie, Cyber-Gaga, and Lo Que Siente La Mujer on it.  But whatever, what's done is done.  Anyway, here is what I thought about the songs:<br />1. Music:  The title song, which is very good, but don't listen to it too many times, because it gets a little annoying after a while. <BR>7 out of 10<br />2. Impressive Instant:  Such a cool song!  Now this one you can listen to this over and over again.  It is so cool and makes you want to get up and say \\"I'm in a trance!\\" <BR>10 out of 10<br />3. Ruaway Lover:  I heard this song was supposed to be on the QAF soundtrack but whatever.  It is a really cool dance song about a club guy who takes women(or men) for all they're worth.<BR>8 out of 10<br />4. I Deserve It:  A great love song which tells the tale of how Madonna found love in Guy Ritchie. <BR>8 out of 10<br />5. Amazing:  Kind of sounds like Beautiful Stranger, but it still kicks ass.  This song would have done wonderfully if it was released as a single.<BR>9 out of 10<br />6. Nobody's Perfect: An awesome song about winning back a lost love.  It is very good and the lyrics are actually very meaningful.<BR>10 out of 10<br />7. Don't Tell Me:  Yes, the up-beat tale about love.  Very cool, and is great on the CD.  While I thought the videowas rather cheesy, the song is not at all and is actually great!<BR>10 out of 10<br />8. What it Feels Like for a Girl:  Yes, Madonna knows what it feels like for a girl, especially when MTV wouldn't pkay the video...  who knows why?  Considering the rap videos they play are no better and in fact WORSE!  This song is very cool, and tells the tale of what it feels like to be a girl in this world.<BR>9 out of 10<br />9. Paradise (Not for Me):  At first, this was the only song on the album that I didn't like.  It is kind of slow, and sounds like it should be on Ray of Light, but after listening to it for a while, I started to sort of like it.<BR>5 out of 10<br />10. Gone:  Such a good song!  This such an amazing song, which does not sound flat or boring!  It is very cool and I liked it a lot.  When I went to see her on August 2nd, I was very glad that she sang Gone instead of You'll See.  It was worth every penny just to see her sing Gone.  This song obviously is about selling out and the a like, and is excellent!<BR>10 out of 10<br />Final Score: 86 out of 100
B0000507PC|5.0|It disturbs me when people who have no idea of Irving's works and ideology dismiss a great film based on an even greater novel as &quot;pro-abortion propoganda.&quot; <br />&quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; is not propoganda of any sort, nor is it pro-anything. It's a movie. It's also a book. Both mediums tell a story. Yes, the story does include bits about abortion, but is that all it's about? No. &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; is a coming-of-age story about a young man who learns to shape his future. IT is about relationships, it is about love, it is about destiny. Abortion is only apart of this complex web of people and interaction; it is not IT.<br />Five stars for this magnificent film.
0446677450|4.0|I got this as an unexpected gift.  Was skeptical at first - you know just another motivational speaker.  Once I got into it, I read it very quickly.  It is quite simple to follow, sometimes a little too obvious (but maybe not for someone who has never thought this way about money). <br />Of course, it does not give you all the answers and details, but enough to realize that you have to have the right frame of mind and not be afraid to lose a little money while you are learning to make money.  He gives some ideas about how to start training yourself in finance and investing.  Plus you have to shed your self doubts.  He never promises it will be easy or quick (took him years to learn all of his lessons).  Only becomes easy after you have built your skills assessing deals and amassing assets and are practiced at spotting undervalued assets you can snap up!<br />I've now made up my mind that financial independence is something I can achieve before standard retirement age.  I'm already looking for more info... this book is mostly to get you motivated to try and make a break from the rat race and have power over money, rather than the other way around.
B000004286|5.0|I am not a professional reviewer so i´m not gonna try.<BR>This is the absolute best soundtracks ever made, all categories, all time. I don´t even have to listen to anything else to compare because i know nothing will come close to this.<br />But you have to have hifi-quality equipment to fully experience the magic and wonder of this soundtrack.
020161622X|3.0|I read the glowing reviews here and then browsed it at the bookstore...where it looked pretty good...When I took it home and started reading it, a different picture evolved...Here are a few nuggets:<br />1. Much of what the authors espouse is just common sense and would be picked up or developed by most bright developers on their own.<br />2. Some of what the authors espouse is just wrong...we have suggestions that if your code is correct then it will take little effort to make it run on Win16, Win 32 , and different flavors of Unix or whatever environment. I disagree. This would only be true for the most trivial programs. Even using a factory pattern, as opposed to the usual compiler switches, one could build such a losely coupled and modern system to run on different environments...but it would hardly be easy to do because the different environments require separate (and hardwon!) skillsets/knowledge...not easy to find in one developer...Perhaps the authors should try their hand on some cross-browser, cross operating system DHTML...and make sure it runs on all versions of Netscape to boot.<br />3. The authors elevating of the text editor and command line over IDE is just non-sense...and again wrong...they say you cannot configure the IDEs...anyone who has written an add-in for VB knows it is indeed possible.<br />4. I could go on, but I will conclude with their total lack of understanding of Physics which they quote wrongly...the Universe does not split(Shroedinger's cat) after a measurement and Heisenberg said it was ,IN PRINCIPAL, impossible to perform certain measurements without disturbing the system...On the other hand, it is perfectly possible to perform debugging without disturbing the code...<br />5. And they have the audacity to call their book &quot;...from journeyman to master.&quot;<br />Having said all of that, there are good ideas to provoke one's computing thinking in this book...and so while I would recommend it, just be careful to examine their suggestions critically before adopting them.critically before adopting them.
B00004XOWM|4.0|This CD is much softer than the old limp bizkit, however he still manages to write catchy tunes. Livin' it up, Getcha groove on, rolling, my way, my generation, and the rollin' remix are all excellent tracks, but I believe his last cd was much better
B00005QZ7U|5.0|There were some critics who said that this movie had little or no emotion tied in with the innovative special effects. I couldn't agree less. The entire production is about nothing but emotion, and I must confess that in the five-day period I rented it from the video store it hardly left the VCR at all. I wish there were more than five stars to use.<BR>However, I will definitely say that it is a love-it-or-hate-it situation. If one word was necessary to describe the entire product I would use &quot;bizarre,&quot; but if you're ready for a creative and new look at an otherwise commonplace plot, Moulin Rouge should be seen by everyone.
B000000W5H|4.0|This album pretty much marked the second career of the Stones. They were being called the worlds greatest rock and roll band, but at the same time they were going through a transition period with their sound. Jagger musta been listening to a lot of soul and R&amp;B during this period. They do a very respectable version of the Temptations &quot;Ain't Too Proud To Beg&quot;, which is still a pretty popular tune on the oldies stations. He also does some funky soul on &quot;Fingerprint File&quot;. The rest of the album though, is pretty much just rock and roll. The title song, &quot;It's Only Rock And Roll&quot;, with that familiar opening guitar riff, plus &quot;Dance Little Sister&quot; also still remain popular airplays. The song though, that still remains my favorite Stones tune to this day, is &quot;Time Waits For No One&quot;. What a great song! This one alone is worth the price admission here. The guitar interplay between Mick Taylor and Keith Richards on this is simply delicious. The Stones had never done anything like this six string jam before, or since. It would have been nice if they would have done more of this type of material on this record, because Richards and Taylor played great off of each other. For some reason though, this was Mick Taylor's last album with the Stones. I guess there was just one too many Mick's in the band for the Glimmer Twins to handle at the time. As for this album, it's a little erratic in spots, but still, with the exception of &quot;Exile On Main Street&quot; and &quot;Some Girls&quot;, this holds up well with the rest of their latter day albums. Like the title says, it's only rock and roll, and for the most part, I liked it.
1558908358|4.0|Tron was the first movie to use CGI in such a bold way as to make a whole city from computer animated pixels.  To create a world of computer animation in the days of 386 processers and less then 2 Megabytes of RAM must have been painstaking.  Thankfully, the movie today is still sharp.  The creators were smart enough to make sure the movie remained timeless in it's look and execution.  The storyline is original (it had to be to get a premises for the entire movie), a computer whiz, played by Jeff Bridges, gets sucked into the computer world as he tries to find evidence that his programs were stolen.  What ensues is an adventure that no one has duplicated today, although it would be much easier with today's technology.  They should consider a sequel, or a remake because the actions scenes seem a little slim in places, as if they just couldn't squeeze anymore images out of the computer.  But suffice to say, Tron is a groundbreaking movie, making way for movies like Last Starfighter and computer animated special effects.  Definitly worth the DVD version for the special effects and sound quality.
B00003CXAA|4.0|GODFATHER 1<BR>When my dad first introduced me to this movie,I really thought it is about a godfather.But when my dad told me what it was about(a mafia group) I immediately said : \\"No Daddy,I don't want to see this movie.When the movie started,it was in a way quite boring for a 9 year old kid.But when I manage to flow with the movie,I got engrossed with it.It is about the Corleone family.They are  mafia.This Don Corleone has three children and a daughter.Tom Hegon is Don Coleone's adopted son.Sonny,Micheal and Fredo are his real sons.Some parts are really brutal.So I encourage young kids to cover their eyes when it comes to a brutal part.I admire Tom for his loyalty,Sonny for his violence and Micheal for his amazing brain.The Corleone family,Tattaglia family and many other groups are fighting for supremacy.A lot of brutal actions take place.All the families fight each other.I was really anxious for the Corleone family.Watch this movie and you won't regret buying it.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Requiem for a Dream really stands out in a world that sometimes condemns movies over plot. Although I enjoyed the plot as well, it was the sheer artsyness that atracted me to it. It's a perfectly woven quilt of visual and audio stimulus; from the super-speed pupil dialation, to the sound it makes every time Ellen Burstyn's excellent portrayal of a pill poppin granny, picks up the remote control to her television. <BR>     For those who have never heard the term &quot;multi-media&quot;, it is more than simply a movie, it is the marriage of the visual and audio aspects to stimulate and titilate the on looker's brain. For those interested in multi-media, check out DJ Q-Bert's movie &quot;Wave Twisters&quot;. It is Q-bert's music played over truly crazy animation, sort of in the spirit of Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; (another great). Requiem is a little more on the visual end of the spectrum than those mentioned above, but an outstanding multi-media production none the less. I would highly recomend &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; to any one. I would also reccomend those other somewhat closed minded reviewers to watch it again, and appreciate it for it's multi-media value. So watch it, even if only to experience it's Multi-Media madness. Over all summary: a Multi-Media Masterpiece
6305128952|5.0|I've watched this movie a number of times and all i can say that it is one of the best movies ever made. Robert Redford has certainly set a standard of making movies which is nearlly perfect and unparallel in recent times.
0156421178|5.0|George Orwell is now remembered for two works Animal Farm and 1984. As these books are parodies of Stalinist Russia one would imagine over time that he will gradually sink into obscurity. <br />This book is an earlier work and tells of his experience as a volunteer during the Spanish Civil War. Orwell was a volunteer with the forces organized by POUM. The early part of the book tells of his experiences at the front line. As a memoir it is remarkable honest and readable. <br />The Spanish Civil War was one of the early experiences of Communism seizing a nationalist movement and diverting it for their own purposes. Orwell was horrified at this occurring and a good deal of the book deals with the politics of the situation. He describes how a popular movement with some chance of winning was hijacked by Stalin's cronies and ended up being defeated. <br />It is no surprise that he ended up being one of the most articulate and effective critics of Stalinism. This book is readable and a fascinating picture of a pivotal time in history.

B00005OWEG|5.0|Apocalypse Now Redux is amazing, the movie is great, some people say that some of the new additions are useless and boring, but they are not at all, the French Plantation scene was fairly good I think, very informative about the war in fact, the scene with the Playboy bunnies was, well, a bit exaggerated, but it was funny, at lest to me it was, plus, that scene it's not that long anyway. This was and will always be a masterpiece, some people say that now the film was ruined. Apocalypse Now Redux has been one of the greatest movies in history, with a great cast, Marlon Brando is memorable as Kurtz, plus he gets you to think, Robert Duvall was great as Kilgore, short but very good, Martin Sheen is amazing, from the opening scene all the way to the last, he really makes the movie flow, you hardly notice the 3 hours, you don't feel that the movie is too long, plus Dennis Hopper makes a great contribution, and in case you haven't notice, Mr Clean on the boat is 17 year old Laurence Fishburne, and the guy with glasses in the briefing room when Martin Sheen is told his assignment, that is Harrison Ford, also, even Francis Ford Coppola makes a cameo appearance, the film director when Martin Sheen gets to the beach, he was filming the soldiers and telling them to pretend they were fighting. What more can you ask, plus the film is amazing, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the story, the actors, the acting, everything. What you can ask is more special features on the DVD, again Paramount ruins it, the DVD only has a trailer, what is that, this movie deserves a better treatment, try a commentary, featurettes, documentaries, like the \\"Heart of Darkness\\", which is of the book on what Coppola based the movie, something, but just a trailer, they say that people learn from their mistakes, like Braveheart, The Untouchables, and all the other DVD editions with nothing, when Enemy at the Gates was released in DVD, I though that finally Paramount had learned, the version had enough special features to make us like the movie even more, but again, they take the wrong course with Apocalypse Now Redux, buy the movie, is amazing, but don't expect any special feature. \\"The Horror\\" is what Paramount makes us go through with their DVD editions, it looks like they don't have \\"The Strength\\" to get better DVD editions, the movie \\"Smells like Victory\\", but not the DVD.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Howard Shore does a wonderful job of translating emotions into song.  There are so many times in various tracks where it touches something very deep inside.  The Council of Elrond with Aniron is perhaps the most haunting because while it is a love theme for Aragorn and Arwen, underlying, there is a deep sense of grief.  I won't spoil it, but suffice to say that it compliments the movie scene very well.<BR>In Dreams (featured in The Breaking of the Fellowship) is another moving piece and Edward Ross has a voice like an angel!  <BR>Howard Shore does a masterful job at moving your emotions and really enhances the Lord of the Rings movie.  I have been a Tolkien fan for the past 25 years, and have waited so long for this.  You know how sometimes when you spend a lot of time anticipating something only to have built it up so much that the actual event is a let down?  This is not the case here.  The movie and the soundtrack both have far exceeded my expectations and hopes.  Here is one very happy Tolkien fan!<BR>Listen to the soundtrack, watch the movie, and repeat often!
6304071906|1.0|You can spend nearly four hours of your time watching writer/director Michael Cimino's 1980 &quot;Heaven's Gate&quot; and come away satisfied for any number of reasons . . .<br />You may, for example, have decided that this is the lesser of two evils as opposed to listening to your pet gerbil sing &quot;Pagliacci.&quot;  Not knowing your gerbil, or his vocal abilities, I'm willing to concede that &quot;Heaven's Gate&quot; may just barely have been the better option.<br />There are people I know (and respect, by the way) -- intelligent, articulate, and sensitive -- who swear that &quot;Heaven's Gate&quot; is an overlooked masterpiece; invariably, however, they're the same people who count the individual dots in a Georges Seurat painting.<br />But unlike Seurat's &quot;pointillism&quot; approach, Cimino's &quot;overlooked masterpiece&quot; is a film in which the individual dots never manage to quite add up to anything.  A breathtakingly solid all-star cast, for example, is (with the possible exception of Christopher Walken) wasted.  As is the truly incredible cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond.  As is the costuming, the location work, the music, the . . .  <br />Never mind; you see where I'm headed here.  Everything, tragically, is wasted in this &quot;overlooked masterpiece.&quot;<br />There's an analogy at work:  Orson Welles, the &quot;boy-genius&quot; of the 1940s, brilliant, ego-driven, given entirely too much control over his own projects.  Forget, for the moment, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; or &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; (etc., etc., etc.)  Think of . . .  &quot;MacBeth,&quot; Welles' lavishly (for the times)-mounted filmic expedition into a Shakespeare masterpiece: Welles decreed for this film a high degree of &quot;authenticity,&quot; which included a moody, mostly dark, mist-laden, bleak cinematographic treatment of the Scottish highlands, which was matched by the proclivity of all characters to render their lines in a Scottish &quot;burr&quot;; the end result, sadly, was a film in which one can neither see --nor understand -- a damn thing!<br />Thus Cimino, with &quot;Heaven's Gate:&quot;  Given entirely too much control, he manages to construct a film in which -- although we can see much (despite the industrial haze which seems to pervade far too many scenes), and in which we may even be able to understand most of the lines that are spoken -- we're likely to come away realizing that we've neither seen (nor understood) a damn thing.  And worse yet, we've also not met much of anyone in the film about whom we care a whit.<br />So why did I give this film even one star?  Because, when I tried my best to rate it on a minus scale, Amazon's system kept kicking my review back at me with a &quot;Whoops! Looks like you forgot to fill in a required space!&quot; message.<br />OK . . .  so consider this an example of &quot;damning with FAINT praise.&quot;
B000002JS6|5.0|Lets push aside the fact that AC/DC 1980 album is one of the top six best selling rock albums of all time!  Truth be told under all it's glamour it remains an awesome album.  Few bands have the guts to release a huge album like this after their original frontman died!  So let give AC/DC that respect but what makes this album a true classic?<br />The answer well...the songs!  The album was about Bon Scott for Bon Scott and apart from the talk of sex drugs and booze and death lies the simple fact that this is great music.<BR>The album contains four hug hits those beng the title track BACK IN BLACK, the haunting HELLS BELLS, the popular YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG and thefast paced SHOOT TO THRILL.  However the other songs are just as good as the classic quartet.  HAVE A DRINK on me is a excellent tune as well as SHAKE A LEG is classic AC/DC.  ROCK 'N ROLL AIN'T NOISE POLLUTION delivers a powerful message.  The other tunes are decent but not groundbreaking GIVING THE DOG A BONE is good and HONEY WHAT DO YA DO FOR MONEY is interesting but LET ME PUT MY LOVEINTO YOU is rather excessive.<br />Overall Back in Black is an essential classic from AC/DC.  Everyone should have this in their cd collection so do yourself a favour and go get it!  Highly recommended!
B00003CXAA|5.0|The bonus disc is nice on this one, it has lots of extras.
B000002JSV|5.0|Powerage was the first AC/DC album I bought so it is special to me.  However I could not believe how this album has not sold as much as the others over the years.  I mean there are some great underrated AC/DC clasics here.<br />The album contains one hit SIN CITY an awesome song but there is more to this cd than just that song.  DOWN PAYMENT BLUES is another underrated classic one of my faves.  RIFF RAFF, UP TO MY NECK IN YOU and KICKED IN THE TEETH fetured some of Angus' best guitar playing.  WHAT'S NEXT TO THE MOON is excellent and GIMME A BULLET and GONE SHOOTIN' are classic AC/DC.  The opening track ROCK 'N ROLL DAMNATION is not as effective as the other but still is very listenable.<br />Overall Powerage is a greatly underrated album.  It is probably the bands bluesiest effort but it still contains some hot rod underrated classic that need to be discovered.  Highly recommended!
B00005R87Q|5.0|i absolutely loved this movie because for one it gave my boyfriend all he needs in a movie-stunts, fast cars, and awesome graphics. then, the movie suited my needs, great looking guys, guys, guys. he'll never know why i liked it so much, and he's always willing to watch it again &amp; again!
B000002JS8|5.0|Highway To Hell was Bon's last album with the band before his death.  By this time AC/DC was already becoming a big hit all over the world so when the album came out it was a massive hit. Although the album only seems to carry one hit that being the title track HIGHWAY TO HELL it contains a bunch of other over the edge tunes that would never pass as filler!<br />GIRLS GOT RHYTHM has an excellent beat and WALK ALL OVER YOU is a AC/DC classic.  TOUCH TO MUCH is a great hard rock song.  BEATING AROUND THE BUSH has an awesome guitar riff and SHOT DOWN IN FLAMES is a pure classic.  GET IT HOT is weaker than the rest particularily because of it length but none the less is an awesome effort.  IF YOU WANT BLOOD YOU GOT IT goes along the same lines as SHOT DOWN IN FLAMES.  LOVE HUNGRY MAN is good but not great and NIGHT PROWLER is a creepy closer.  <br />Overall I believe this is AC/DC best album.  Many say BACK IN BLACK takes it but I would have to go with this classic.  It is just a little more lively than it's successor.  Highly recommended!  One of my favourite albums ever!
B00003CXA4|5.0|For discussions of the film's cinematic merits, you can read many of the other, fine reviews here. I'd like to speak to the material of the film itself. Though &quot;Ghandi&quot; begins in the 19th century and ends in the first half of the 20th, this is truly a story for the new  millenium. The life story of Ghandi is one that could never have been imagined; no one could ever have taken it seriously. No literary character as humble, strong, provocative, courageous, and clever could ever have been accepted. Instead, such a life had to be physically manifested.<br />Indeed, in the film itself, contemporaries early on could not take Mohandas seriously. Finding him about as threatening as a mosquito, one character quips, &quot;I'm sure the British are shaking in their boots.&quot; Yet, shake they did, in response to one whose strength of will and moral rightness (&quot;righteousness&quot; has been too misused to even apply here) moved nations. These qualities, as the film hints in its chronological layout, are not demonstrated quickly. The results they bring are not realized by the next newscast, the next quarter's reports, or even the next State of the Union address. They take time. Fighting an enemy back to its side of an artificial line might seem efficient, but it proves only expedient.<br />Watch &quot;Ghandi&quot; for lessons in Soul Force. Ben Kingsley performs as if the Cosmos is pouring itself into Ghandi, creating a template for us to model, as Jesus used to be used.<br />(I wonder what Nelson Mandela thought of the film.)
0684830515|3.0|The purpose of The Sun Also Rises is to convey the seemly pointless lives of the Lost Generation.  In order to illustrate the disillusionment of Jake, Brett, Cohn, and Bill, Hemingway presents an &quot;anti-hero&quot; novel.  It does not follow any <BR>exciting story plot; and at the novel's end, none of the characters have resolved any enduring conflicts or have <BR>gained any acclaim.  This technique achieves Hemingways' purpose of characterizing the &quot;Lost Generation,&quot; but distances his readers.  I read the book for my AP English class; I found it more interesting to analyze The Sun Also Rises than actually read.  Many of the book's techniques, such as symbol and Hemingways' terse but descriptive language, are not readilly visibly on a first reading.  However, if you didn't enjoy the story the first time around, I wouldn't suggest tackling it again.  <br />If you're looking for a book with a Lost Generation plot and an interesting story, turn to Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. If you want another Hemingway, A Farewell to Arms is slightly more interesting.  But The Old Man and the Sea is, in my opinion, Hemingway's best--and if you don't like it, at least it is short enough that you do not has to spend much time reading it.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|It was great when I saw it in the cinema, but it is even better when I finally (!!) got to see all the special features on the amazing 2 pack DVD!<BR>I didn't know that they recorded LIVE! WOW! What a talent!<BR>Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor can easily switch to singing careers, what a voice!<BR>And the colors, the production... There's no word good enough to describe it!<BR>Spactacular!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|It's too bad that there are some or many people out there that think this movie sucks.  The fact is that it is a great film for people who like to use their brains when watching a movie. The film is basically a puzzle that you the viewer has to piece together as it plays. If you pay attention to all the details then you will understand the idea and concept. The main idea is that you are to see and think just like the Leonard character thinks and see's. If you dont like this type of movie, then mabye you should see something more on your level like The Waterboy or Toy Story.
B000001DTM|5.0|This album says it all, sums up an era before it even began, amazing. The lead breaks in the fly and until the end of the world bring me to tears, the edge has never sounded better than on this record. I saw them 3 times on this tour. Buy this album if you dont own it. I still constantly play it 9 years later. By far my favorite U2 record. If it wasnt for Nevermind, which is a great record, but unfortunately overshadows this one, this would be the most definitive record of the 90's. It took music to a totally new place. Fresh, original, lush, romantic, sexy, and heartbreaking at times. This album rules. BUY IT!
B000002I6T|5.0|For almost 30 years now, &quot;If I Could Only Remember My Name&quot; has been my constant companion, first on vinyl, then on cassette, then on cd. I thank the Force and all the gods for David Crosby, that he didn't manage to succeed in offing himself, and had the time and energy to give our poor planet some of the most beautifully compellingly hauntingly mesmerizing music ever recorded. Just finished reading his book &quot;Stand and Be Counted&quot;, and he hasn't lost one iota of the passion he showed as a younger man. As a sometime guitar-player I am still transfixed by the guitar work on this album, and trying to figure out by ear some of David's and Joni's alternate tunings has often occupied my time. It's an even greater thrill to pick out the voices of his PERRO (Google Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra if you don't know who this is) compadres who also spent a lot of time on my phonograph, who today spend time on my cd-player. Nowadays, without a chemical or herbal assist, his early music still transports me to another plane, and the satisfaction, gratification and serenity I feel as the last chords fade cannot be duplicated by the music of any other human on this planet. I thought I'd seen someone who seemed at last to know the truth, and they call him David Crosby.
B00004Y7SF|1.0|Sorry to say this but this CD stinks badly. even though I do not have ityet I listened to previews on some of her songs on her xmas CD and there bad bad, real bad. <BR>And just to think that Christina is a good singer , Idon't think that anymore after I find that Christina sings Celine Dion's these are the special times song and o holy night song!!<BR>Please do not buy this CD it's a waste of money!<BR>Christina can't sing!<BR>P.S.<BR>If you want a xmas CD go out and buy Celine Dion's xmas CD, it's much better.
B00000AFWW|5.0|Musically think the Go-Go's with a hard edge. Lyrically think still haunted by a famous suicide.  This is superb, dark rock, which drives against that dark grain with guitar hooks to last all night long.  At least four cuts explicitly plumb emotions at Cobain's self-destruction.  Playing Your Song and Use Once and Destroy rage at the industry and the drugs.  Reasons to Be Beautiful is furious with him; Northern Star faces the cold, loneliness and isolation at the loss.  All impressive, all downers.  Elsewhere, ringing guitars drive Awful (and a rare burst of optimism &quot;if the world is so wrong/You can take it all with just one song...&quot;) and Boys on the Radio, my personal two favorites here.  The title song and Malibu are not far behind, strong radio rockers. Hit So Hard (&quot;he hit so hard/I saw God&quot;) is the successor generation in abusive relationships to the Crystals of the 60s (&quot;He hit me/and it felt like a kiss&quot;). Overall, not a weak cut among the thirteen, but behind the bright, pop production there is not much joy either.  Love's last lyric in the liner notes proclaims, &quot;Oh, this life is a war.&quot;  She's still battling in that war and, on the evidence of this CD, is furious that Cobain's not.  A terrific, memorable work.
B00004X01U|5.0|Let's face it.  Madonna rules.  Everyone else in mainstream music is lipsyncing and line dancing 10 years behind her.  She's so progressive, amazing, and doesn't care what people think of her.<br />This album is it.  Eclectic, electronic, robotic, emotional.<BR>Funky folky futuristic melodic beautiful music to dance, reflect, and rebel to.<br />All the tracks on the album will astound you with it's newness and brilliance except 'Amazing' (a collaboration with William Orbit).  It doesn't suck.  It just doesn't up the ante like the other songs do.  Still, you'll be rockin and singing along to it.<br />'Impressive Instant' is a stand out track that wasn't released as a single.  Should've though, cause it's so CosmicSexyCool it would blow everything else on the radio or MTV/TRL out of the atmosphere.<br />That's Madonna's power.  She is such an incredible songwriter/musician/lyricist/poet artist.<br />Dig in and enjoy.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Christian (Ewan McGregor) is a writer in Paris and fate gives him the opportunity to write his first major masterpiece, his fate being an Argentinean man crashing through his ceiling followed by a dwarf (John Leguizamo).  It seems the two men were rehearsing for a play they are putting together with hopes to bring to the sexy Satine (Nicole Kidman) a dancer at Moulin Rouge.  As the two men rehearse, the dwarf explains his buddy suffers from narcolepsy and they need a new lead and Christian is the man to fill his shoes, the only glitch in the play is they can't seem to finish one song, and when Christian adds the lyrics they need they put into action a plan to invade Moulin Rouge and present the play to Satine.<br />With hopes of being a real actress, Satine is quickly drawn to the play, the only problem is The Duke, a man set out to buy the Moulin Rouge and make Satine his property.<br />Can Christian and Satine put on the show of their dreams? Can Christian and Satine enjoy the love that's in their hearts? And, can they stop the evil Duke? Through song and dance we will find the answer to all these questions.<br />`Moulin Rouge' is unlike anything you have ever seen.  Visually stunning, and artistically a masterpiece the film breaks new ground to combine love, music, dance, and the sexy setting of a high-end bordello in 1899 Paris.<br />Ewan McGregor turns in another fine performance as the tortured writer held captive by his love for Satine, and Nicole Kidman gives one of her best performances as the singer/dancer/&quot;entertainer&quot;.<br />Incorporating vivid sets, sharp editing, and modern songs `Moulin Rouge' manages to create a Paris of wonder and excitement, one that viewers will be entranced by.<br />Nick Gonnella
B00005QDW1|1.0|i am a huge no doubt fan and have all of their CD's and recently added Rock Steady to my collection.  each one of the albums before I had fallen instantly in love with but when i popped this one into my CD player i was very dissapointed.  I found most of the songs to be very similar to one another yet hardly any of them are even somewhat decent! and no doubt's origional ska/punk edge was lost and they seem to be heading towards a more technoish beat which i didn't like at all.  I never listen to this album now and still continue playing my favorite album &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;
B00005R87Q|4.0|Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) rules the streets with his \\"team\\" in the world of illegal street races.  Running a luncheonette and a garage, Dominic makes money to pay for the mortgage on his house, and keep his sister (Jordana Brewster) in school, but that money alone is not enough so he resorts to the illegal ways to keep the cash flowing. Vowing to kill himself before returning to prison, Dominic stays one step ahead of the police until he meets Brian (Paul Walker), an undercover cop investigating a series of bizarre truck heists.<br />The FBI believe Dominic and his crew are behind the robberies, and it's Brian's job to find enough evidence against, but putting together the case against this crew will prove to be difficult because Brian becomes friends with Dominic and starts to understand his difficult life, and at the same time he is falling in love with his sister.  To make matters worse, Dominics rival Johnny Tran drops in to settle some old scores, and the list of suspects in the robbery case is growing larger.<br />`The Fast And The Furious' is top-notch entertainment.  Containing serious action sequences, and a thrilling mystery of the robberies, `The Fast And The Furious scores on many levels.  The action scenes are some of the best filmed racing sequences I have ever scene, and the pulsing soundtrack keeps things at a high energy level.<br />The performances from Walker, and Diesel are right on the money, and the supporting cast of Brewster, Michelle Rodriguez, Chad Linberg, Johnny Strong and Ted Levine bring life to the characters they play.<br />Great action, and a pulsing soundtrack will keep you glued to your seat for two hours of entertainment.
0783117388|5.0|The Sex and the City-The Complete First Season is a great item for those who don't have cable TV (unlike me). I get HBO just to watch these shows. Most of the year I don't have HBO, but when June comes, I rush to get it. I have all of the first, second, and third season on tape, but this is a great gift idea for friends. I will probably buy this for one of my family and friends for birthdays or holidays (just to get them as addicted as I am). The great thing about this show is that every woman can see a little bit of herself in every one of the characters. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is the character I most relate to because of her fashion sense and her personality (very similar to mine). Samantha (Kim Catrall) is the woman that most women vilify, but wish they were like. She is so bold, daring and downright outrageous. There is a little Samantha in everyone. Miranda is the workaholic of the bunch who seeks perfection in everyone in everything. She is bold like Samantha, but in a different way. Charlotte is the one who you find endearing. Her search for her Prince Charming with a Madison Avenue job and Park Avenue apartment is something to watch. She goes through so many frogs, it is hilarious to watch. <br />This is the season that all of the newer fans must see.  The first season gives insight into each of the four main characters (it relies more on the book (written by Candace Bushnell-a great read) in its descriptions of the characters ).  It includes the beginning of the relationship of Carrie &amp; Mr. Big and the first break-up (to be followed in the next few seasons by many more). It also includes the many misadventures of Miranda, which makes this season all the funnier.  Samantha is at her vampiest.  Charlotte is not as prudish and judgemental in this season (something to see). It may not be the best season of the show (which is season 3), but remember there would not be a show without this season.<br />This show has all of the elements that keep you tuning in. This is a must buy for fans of the later seasons.  Buy it!!!
0688101364|3.0|Well, it's the second Christmas in a row that I have ventured to make cookies from this recipe book. Last year's &quot;Mexican Wedding Cakes&quot; cookies were a total disaster----couldn't even get a dough to form. Today I made the &quot;Mom's Coconut Kisses&quot; with some degree of success, but baking time was too long and I burnt the first batch. What is with these recipes? I am a decent cook, can certainly follow directions, and yet keep getting disappointed. Perhaps you will have better luck than I. <br />The book has photos of all of the recipes, which is nice, but is very wordy in terms of directions: the author includes every imaginable way of mixing the cookies and lists specific directions for each. While helpful, it makes each recipe look quite daunting. <br />I'm sure there are many other recipe books that include just as many nice recipes but actually work....
1573225517|4.0|Nick Hornby's comic romp about a pathetic thirty-something incapable of love starts strongly, but inevitably falls into the predictable pit of direct-to-Hollywood fiction. Rob, anti-hero, slacker, hero to his fellow thirty-somethings, lives what he does, listening to music. He and his two part-time full-time co-workers don't really work, they sit around talking about music, listing their favorite and most-hated songs. After work, Rob whines about Laura, who has left him for the guy upstairs, and hooks up with other women while he waits for her to come to her senses.<br />Rob is at his best as the unrepentant male. His world circles around him, as our worlds circle around us. He's selfish and small: a real guy. He continually lists his life's efforts and failures, categorizing them like records in his collection. Shades of his honorable self shine through. I kept wanting to tell him to keep his head down, he'll get through it, but eventually he falls into the maw of predictability and is on his way to a future of diaper bags and car pools.<br />The first two-thirds of HIGH FIDELITY are an anthem for anyone born in the sixties. The last third, anathema to anyone who hoped for something different.
B00005RIKD|5.0|i really enjoyed the opportunity to hear Sting reinterpret so many of his hits....  He's one of those artists that has been playing in the background of my life for the last 20 years, and his songs feel like old friends.  There's this kind of comfort or soothing effect because the listener, the songs and the performer are so familiar to each other. I was surprised by just how much I enjoyed this CD's company.
B00005QDW1|4.0|DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM BECAUSE YOU LIKE PREVIOUS NO DOUBT ALBUMS - This album is very different.  I could see people being really disappointed and upset if you are expecting No Doubt's usual Ska sound.  This album is more dance/electronic than ska.  Take a listen to some of the samples from the songs, or wait until you hear it on the radio if you might not like this stuff.<br />That said, I'm pretty happy with the album.  The songs are catchy, and Gwen's voice is awesome as usual.  I do miss the horns and ska sounds, but I've gotten beyond that now :-)
B00000DLV1|5.0|Yup, the last track, \\"Roads\\", certainly steals the show. I've got to admit that I bought this album ... for...laughs, convinced that they wouldn't be able to pull off that tightness live. But this album is just amazing. They are actually better live, and I didn't think I'd ever say that about such a \\"studio\\" group. I used to have Dummy...and have been putting off replacing it as a lot of the music kind of annoys me. I wasn't enough impressed with the second album to fork out for it but did like a couple tracks. So this album pretty much covers all the bases. Only shortcoming (and just for me) was the alternate interpretation of \\"Sour Times\\", by far my favorite song by them. The intro on the studio version is amazing. But the live version loses that. Nonetheless, most people buying this will already have the other albums and will appreciate the \\"new version\\" here as it really is strong song no matter how you approach it. Well done, Portishead.
B00005QW4K|3.0|Why only three stars? Well, if AOD wasn't already such a great movie I would have givin this disc two. The movie runs pretty smoothly until you hit the windmill scene with the &quot;mini Ashes&quot;. In this and a few other sequences the picture quality goes straight to hell. It seems like you actually are watching a bootlegged recording! (duh) I have no complaints about the new scenes themselves though. Watching Ash get clobbered by those little fellas cracked me up as always. I was a bit curious to see the alternate ending and that's why I picked this disc up. I myself prefer the theatrical S-Mart ending. It would have been nice if it were included in the extras. I personally wouldn't recommend this disc to the casual Evil Dead fan. So until next time..shop smart. Shop S-Mart!
B000000H7I|5.0|Frank Mullen does amazing death metal vox. Mike Smith has unbelievable double bass chops. Great guitar riffs can be found here as well. While &quot;Breeding The Spawn&quot; is a little different and &quot;Pierced From Within&quot; is a little more polished and the drumming is not as good, this is the ultimate Suffocation album. To all the rap metal fans out there, go buy this album and tell me you're not blown away. I can't recommend this enough. Fans of Cannibal Corpse and Morbid Angel will enjoy this. Best songs are &quot;Infecting The Crypts&quot;, &quot;Reincremation&quot;, and &quot;Mass Obliteration&quot;. Sure nothin' soft about this album. If you are expecting another (ho, hum) Linkin Park, I don't know what is wrong w/ you. Buy this if you dare!!!
B00005QZ7U|1.0|A melange of paper-thin plot, garish turn-of-the-century costumes and contemporary music (melange is, of course, the French word for &quot;hopeless mess presented artistically&quot;). The Hollywood hype machine seems desperate to laud this drivel until Niclole Kidman receives an Oscar (perhaps part of her divorce settlement with Tom Cuise, or perhaps just public sympathy run amok) but don't you be fooled. If you feel absolutely compelled to waste two hours of your life, try David Lynch's equally stylish but incomprehensible two-hour Twin Peaks finale instead. It also has midgets and velvet drapes, but at least the midgets talk backwards and no one sings &quot;The Sound of Music.&quot; Or drink a bottle of absinthe instead.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This particular film is loaded with music, dance and colorful charectors. Based on the Orphean myth this startstudded cast brings the screen to life in this nonstop party. No rules, no limits, only on rule... never fall in love. Welcome to the Moulin Rouge.
B000001GQR|3.0|This rendition of Schubert's Ninth is adequate overall but contains some unfortunate interpretative aspects. One is a ridiculous, frenzied progression to the fast section in the first movement. Then, by strange contrast, the tempo is too slow proceeding to the coda of the same movement. Due to these odd variations in tempi the whole movement lacks balance, but if you can make it through it the other three are fine enough. However, if you really want to hear the finest recording ever made of this piece then try to obtain Alexander von Pitamic's version with the Suddeutsche Philharmonic. This recording is truly awesome! Although this Furtwangler recording captures the deep spirituality and feeling of this magnificent symphony, in a few places it lacks a crucial aspect which is gloriously present in von Pitamic's: power.<br /><br />If you do attempt to find von Pitamic's version then I wish you luck, because you're certainly going to need an abundance of it. I bought it on a cassette tape under the Maestro label almost eight years ago, and have scoured the Internet in a futile attempt to obtain it on CD (I couldn't even find it on cassette).
0312965788|5.0|I first read this book when I was in elementary school, and that launched me into the wonderful world of James Herriot.<br />The reason I love this (and the other books in the series) is because the author creates a wonderful picture of the beauty of life in the Yorkshire Dales.  I love his writing style!  Every character in his book is interesting or amusing, including his own character.  Even the animals have very interesting personalities.<br />Unless you are terribly squeamish (because there is some vivid detail about veterinary procedures), I highly recommend that you read this book.  I think it would be a very enjoyable read for almost anyone.
B00005QZWI|4.0|For the rare person who has bought the soundtrack already and NOT seen the movie, or just plain hasn't noticed, the main theme that plays when the title comes on, and near the end of the movie when Frodo is wandering around the stone ruins, specifically by the large stone head, is missing from this soundtrack.  That was my favorite theme from the movie, and for me, the most catchy, and I would've given this soundtrack 5 stars if it included that theme.  That theme would've lifted this soundtrack to \\"truly great\\" status, much like the main theme's of many other movies make them stand out.  It's even catchier than the main action theme, played wonderfully in several tracks, most notably The Breaking of the Fellowship and the Bridge of Khaz-Dam.  Fortunately, it's in the movie, but you have to pay at least $6 to hear that theme :)<br />Concerning Hobbits is a wonderful tune, playful without getting too silly.<br />The addition of Enya to the soundtrack was quite unnecessary, and seems more of a marketing move than a musical one.  Her music is no different than anything else she's released and is the least innovative stuff of the bunch.  At least it goes down easy though.<br />The darkest tune is The Black Rider, with some truly scary string work.<br />After having seen this wonderful movie (best one I've ever seen on the big screen, and easily one of my top 5 favorites), I must say that this soundtrack leaves a sour taste, because there's so much great music in the movie that's left out on this soundtrack.  *sigh*  If you really want to hear the soundtrack to this movie, go SEE IT.  Listening to this soundtrack would be like listening to a Star Wars soundtrack without the freaking Star Wars theme..  Sure lots of great music, but where is that theme you can't get out of your head??
B00005QZ7U|5.0|i loved this movie.<BR>it has a great story and nicole does a great job at everything.<BR>im sure that she is going to get an oscar nomination for this movie.<BR>so run to get a copy of this amazing movie.<BR>you need to have it in your collection.<BR>believe me....<BR>10 *'S
B0000025RI|3.0|I'm not going to lie: When my aunt bought me Michael Jackson's &quot;Thriller&quot; in 1982, I switched it with my brother for a Bar-Kays album. Not that I thought &quot;Thriller&quot; was horrible, just I wasn't crazy about it.<br />I know some people may say, &quot;See what you know,&quot; but what people forget is that &quot;Thriller&quot; was panned by critics when it was released in 1982. The album had no cohesion to it -- however, no one could imagine the impact television (especially music video channels and Michael Jackson's electrifying performance on Motown's 25th anniversary show) would have on the album, the music industry and the world.<br />Now we're some 20 years away from Michaelmania, I still stand by what I said then: I'm not crazy about &quot;Thriller.&quot; I liked &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and &quot;Lady in My Life&quot; and &quot;Human Nature&quot; was my favorite tune on the album, but the rest of the songs were fairly uneventful or lame to me. Jackson's groundbreaking videos for &quot;Beat It&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot; carried those songs, and most of his other post-&quot;Billie Jean&quot; singles (&quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin',&quot; &quot;P.Y.T&quot;) sold on the massive popularity of Jackson's fame. We're not even going to mention &quot;The Girl Is Mine,&quot; his duet with Paul McCartney.<br />So just because it may be the greatest-SELLING album of all time doesn't mean it's the best album ever created. After all, I'm still bumping that Bar-Kays album.
0792843835|1.0|\\"Bagdad Café\\" -- aka \\"Out of Rosenheim\\" -- is an offensive chick flick written and directed by Germans who know nothing about North American people of color.<br /><br />A generous interpretation of this work desperately wants to thinks it's a story about friendship between two women from different worlds.<br /><br />The honest interpretation reveals it's about an alien visitor from another planet -- in this case a white savior in the form of a prim and zaftig German tourist (Marianne Sägebrecht ) -- who walks away from her contemptible husband in the middle of Southern California's Mojave Desert and winds up at the rundown Bagdad Gas & Oil café and hotel. It's run by the loud, obnoxious and unkempt African-American Brenda (CCH Pounder), who evicts her trifling, dim-bulb African-American husband. He spends the rest of the film in a car, on high someplace, observing the goings-on through binoculars.<br /><br />The other motley supporting characters include a creepy artist (played eerily to perfection by Jack Palance) whose claim to fame is having painted Hollywood movie sets, and a voluntarily mute woman who ostensibly makes a living as a tattoo artist. The film seems to suggest that she trades in more than just tattoos. Brenda's employee in the café is a Native American man who spends a lot of time napping. She has two teenage children: a dangerously hard-headed nymphet daughter of about 15, and a son who's incredibly skilled at the piano, where he spends practically the entire movie. He has an infant son who's cared for by everyone but his father.<br /><br />The only dignified supporter is the Native American sheriff.<br /><br />And the only good thing about this film is the Academy Award-nominated theme song, \\"Calling You,\\" performed by Jevetta Steele.<br /><br />Maybe my Western chauvinism won't allow me to enjoy a chick flick by non-Americans attempting to create a world of racial harmony -- maybe because that idea is drowned out by Brenda's screeching throughout the first half of the movie.<br /><br />On its face it's a great idea: People from different backgrounds learning tolerance and eventually love and respect. But the execution fails because the racial- and cultural-understanding theme is lost among cultural and racial stereotypes and extreme Euro-worship.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Wish you were here?  ive been humming that tune for the last month and i keep playing it. Its great like so much of this album, rockin tunes and then slower tunes and then that crazy japanese water music on the end, its amazing!  This was the first album of theirs i got but it made me want to check the others out too.
B000002UVZ|5.0|Solid REM effort from the get go. Begin the Begin kicks in a cd that contains pure artistic energy and beauty. I love this cd! The jangly guitars mix with the edgy guitars on the harder numbers and the melodic strumming on the slower ones create great moods; all add potent music to create great songs (lyrically I don't know what the songs mean, but you can still sing along with them).Hyena,I Believe,, Cuyahoga, Fall on Me, and the unlisted Superman continue the uptempo musical assault. The Flowers of Guatamala,What if we give it Away, and Swan Swan H slow it down in order to catch your breath. This is prime time REM.

0064407667|1.0|Well, I brought this book because after reading the blurb on the back cover it sounded like it had a Roald Dahl ring to it. However, because you now KNOW that nothing will go right for the main characters in the book, the book is very predictable, predictable here meaning YOU KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN!!! I'm agreeing with the reader from Edinburgh here, (I'm from Sussex by the way, hello!). All of that explaining of words got really annoying, I still have no idea what all that was about. Also the characters were a bit dim...why on earth didn't they just run away from their evil uncle? I probably didn't enjoy the book because I was 14 when I read it, it is definately for younger children, even though I think the book would even leave them unsatisfied because it has a rubbish ending. Nice try Lemony Snicket, but better luck next time. What sort of a    made-up name is that anyway?
B00005JKES|2.0|As long as we have been waiting for this series to come out on DVD, it is a rip-off for them not to have included the two hour pilot in the four DVD set.  What do they need FOUR DVDs for for just 7 episodes plus some fluff?  Whis is here is great... but Two Stars only for leaving out the pilot.
B000002GVO|5.0|Everybody and their grandmother has greatest hits Vol. I (as I do) and I also already had Hell Freezes Over and On the Border.The question came down between 'Do I get Greatest Hits Vol II or Hotel California?' I am glad I checked into the Hotel because this a must have cd. This cd is basically a greatest hits of post greatest hits vol. I material without the campy material from Long Run (which was why I did not want Greatest Hits Vol II-it had too much Long Run stuff on it). Go through this cd from top to bottom and every song is great (with the exception of Pretty Maids All In a Row, which is only average).Actually, my favorite songs are the non-radio hits such as Wasted Time,Try and Love Again, and the Last Resort. But who doesn't like Hotel California,New Kid in Town,Life in the Fast Lane, and Victim of Love? The best of the Eagles catalog is right here. You can't go wrong with owning this cd and Greatest Hits Vol. I.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|Anyone who had watched Australian director Baz Luhrman's previous two films were doubtless highly anticipating his third film 'Moulin Rouge'.  It's a brash and colourful assault on the sound and the senses.  Beautiful, camp and tragic, 'Moulin Rouge' swept up at the box office and revived what everyone thought was a dead genre.<br />Ewan McGreggor and Nicole Kidman play leading roles as the poor song writer and the gorgeous courtesan.  He loves her but she is bound to a rich and evil lord in order to both jumpstart her acting career and save the Moulin Rouge from bankruptcy.  Kidman as Satine is fantastic, with McGreggor hardly worse and Jim Broadbent as the head of the Moulin Rouge itself being great too.  Although the story itself is riddled with clichés and plot-holes, it's so utterly mesmerising that you can't fail to be taken in.  It's also one of those few films that makes you pay attention to its choreography and music, both of which are the best to be seen in any film released in the past year.<br />The leads' vocals are stupendous, with Kidman later furthering her talents by attaining an English Christmas Number 1 with Robbie Williams and the song 'Something Stupid'.  The dance scenes in the Moulin Rouge are equally fantastic, with many people calling attention to the 'Roxanne' sequence.  However, there are other scenes which can only be described as magical, such as the medley of songs that McGreggor uses to serenade Kidman in her room (a huge white china elephant).  Visually this is beautiful, and this combines well with a collection of recent pop hits such as Elton John's 'Your Song' and 'Lady Marmalade' by Christina Aguilera and co.<br />Whichever way you look at it, this is a winner and its biggest success is appealing a whole new generation to musicals by bringing them into the 21st century with style.
6305327041|5.0|I loved this movie.  I'm sure however, that it is not for everyone.  When I first started watching it, a few thoughts crossed my mind including: Why am I watching this?  What kind of f-ed up movie is this? and Is this supposed to be FUNNY?  But as I continued watching it, I guess it kind of grew on me.  Tim Roth as Ted the Bellboy is the best part of the film.  In the movie, Ted the Bellboy is in charge of taking care of the hotel for this one night (New Years Eve).  He visits 4 rooms (hence the title of the movie) and encounters some... &quot;interesting&quot; characters along the way.  The humor is very over the top, but something about it is very enjoyable to watch.  Antonio Banderrrrres (rolling the r) was hilarious.  I'm giving it 5/5 stars because I didn't NOT like anything about the movie.  You got F-ed by an oven full of witches??  If you enjoy comedies ... I think you should take a chance on this movie.  I'm glad I did.  Don't misbehave!

B000002GYG|4.0|Although Waits has always been an idiosnycratic artist, this is surely his brighest example of perversity. In fact, it is undoubtedly one of the most self-indulgent, masturbatory (there's even two songs alluding to it), arguably overdone albums of the entire singer/songwriter canon. So let me explain why I like it. This is one of the best albums I've ever heard at conjuring up an atmosphere; it really sounds like you're sitting there in a bar listening to Tom do these songs. Certainly, he went to extreme measures to achieve this. For this album, Waits set up an actual nightclub in the Record Plant and invited an audience of friends and fans to listen to him perform this work live in its entirety, as it was recorded. The recording itself is immaculate. The quality is great and crystal-clear and defining, a lot better than on Tom's other albums from this period. It's obvious that a lot of care was put into the conception of this album, and I think it succeeded in what it attempted to accomplish. This is not saying, by any means, that the album is perfect. It can be grating at times, prodding and overlong at others. Most of the songs are prefaced with spoken word, comic bits by Waits that at times are absolutely hilarous. He comes off more as a stand-up comic who also happens to be a musican than simply a musician on this album. Certainly it is a very, very indulgent album, and I don't dare reccommend it to anybody but dedicated Tom Waits fan. Others will surely lose patience with it. This is not Tom Waits's best album - far from it - but fans will revel in it, and he hasn't done this kind of thing since. It's a unique album - for Waits, and, indeed, for anybody. My reccomendation: if you're not familar Tom Waits, you should get some of his better albums first (say, Small Change, Rain Dogs, or Mule Variations.) However, if you dig Waits, you'll definately want to get this.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Besides from sharing with us the horrific tragedies that occured on the day which will live in infamy (December 7, 1941), this movie is a love story.  Caught in a love &quot;triangle&quot; during this major event, hotties Josh Hartnett (Danny Walker) and Ben Affleck ( Rafe McCawley) have to overcome the problem of both loving the same woman, Kate Beckinsale (Evelyn).  I have to tell you, this movie is the best movie you will ever see!  I kept watching it and watching it  because of the wonderful way that a true love and war story is mixed together.  With the help of the cast and crew and everyone that worked on this film, it has become the best video you will ever own.  So, go on and buy it, it would be an AWESOME christmas gift for that special someone to show them how much you care!!!
B00005N9CV|3.0|A nice collection of introspective performances...Couldn't disagree more with some of the previous reviews regarding the string writing - very lush harmonically, and beautifully executed, with woodwinds for color.  And actually I think this is some of Diana's better singing in this style - best intonation of any of her previous albums, without the scoop that is so common in her jazz interpretations.  This is another side of this singer that I would like to see more of.
6305907145|1.0|This movie is so disappointing to anyone who has read and loved Jane Austen's books. Instead of reading this book, the author probably took a poor synopsis and wrote their own story, it is so far from Jane Austen's creation. The character of Fanny is totally rewritten and anachronistic. Don't watch it if you are at all a lover of Jane Austen's books.

B00005JKES|1.0|Okay, perhaps it's not fair for me to write a review for Twin Peaks as I have not yet seen it, so for all those seasoned veterans of Twin Peaks, please don't jump on my back.  My one star review is for the DVD itself, not the content.<br />I have heard so many great things about Twin Peaks, but couldn't find anywhere to rent these DVD's (Blockbuster isn't carrying them, meaning most places probably aren't), so I decided to take a gamble and buy the set.  I rushed home to start watching them, clicked 'play episode 1', and the first things I hear is &quot;Previously on Twin Peaks...&quot;.  Previously?  Isn't this the beginning?  So I started calling people to figure out what was going on, and no one could help me.  The best thing we could come up with was that there was maybe a movie or something I would need to rent that would start to explain things.  Then I get online today and start trying to figure out how to see where Twin Peaks starts, and I am horrified to find out that the pilot IS NOT INCLUDED!  Are you joking?  I am dying to hear who thought it would be a bad idea to let people know how the show started.  I definitely wouldn't have bought this DVD set had I known that it wouldn't actually take me back to the beginning of the show.  I'm new to this and need to see where everything started.<br />I am going to try to march on through the series and not let this deter me, but it's pretty disappointing when a studio has done such a bad job on a DVD set that I don't want to keep watching...especially when I haven't even started watching!
B00004X01U|4.0|I bought this album the week it went on sale (as every Madonna fan did), and I loved it! In my opinion, it is one of Madonna's best albums, and definitely a breath of fresh air after listening to Ray Of Light. Ray Of Light was great, but Music is fun!
B00004SZWD|3.0|I'm a big Stevie Wonder fan because he is the master of melody, but I have to admit that &quot;S.I.T.K.O.L.&quot; isn't very enthralling.  Only one or two other reviewers had the same standpoint.  I don't see why everyone keeps giving it 5 stars.  Even though I like when artist put a lot of songs on an album, it's more the quality (as opposed to quantity) that I care about more.  If Stevie would've have taken all the radio hits and a few other note-worthy songs and made them into a single album, that would've been much better.  Instead I feel short-changed, sorting through the &quot;not-so-captivating&quot; songs just to hear the gems &quot;Summer Soft&quot; and &quot;Another Star&quot;.  Even the songs I actually like I skip towards the end because they trail on waaaaay too long (i.e. &quot;Ordinary Pain&quot; with its segueway, &quot;Joy Inside My Tears&quot; with its refrain, and &quot;Black Man&quot; with its Black Panther-esque chants).  And what's up with &quot;Saturn&quot;?  I mean it's a good song, but it's just plain weird.  I'm sorry to say that you're not missing anything by passing this up at the store.  Get either &quot;Innervisions&quot; or some greatest hits compilation if you really have to have some Stevie Wonder in your collection.
B00005QG9J|5.0|First off, let me just say, I loved this CD. Incubus is different from other bands. They've got something to say. I'm mad about them. I love the way they use different instruments, and do things differently than other bands. Give the album a listen. It's worth it.
B00005Q45W|5.0|Old World Cohen purists (I was arrogantly one for years) will hate this album.  <br />If you don't believe Leonard can ever top anything he has done since 1968 ... this tome is not for you.<br />But if you feel his voice and vision have grown as an \\"artist\\" from \\"Various Positions\\" through \\"I'm your Man\\" and \\"The Future\\" ... then you may agree this is simply his best ... and most consistent effort ... ever. <br />The music is Minimalist, melancholy and sensual for sure ... yet as always ... exquisitely beautiful.<br />The lyrics shadowy, eclectic and austere...<br />Enjoy...

B00001ODHH|4.0|WOW!  What a great movie.  I wish I saw this wonderful flick on the big screen.  When I first saw it, I needed to see it again.  Although this movie is not at all as gory as the first one, it still is a fun movie to watch.  I love the fact that the director made Bruce Campbell act by himself.  This shows a lot of Campbell'<BR>s talent as a stand alone actor.  If you want some middle-aged fun, watch this movie(especially the part when Bruce fights the three little bruces).  I give Sam Raimi a pat on the back for this movie and hope to God that they make more.
B000002UAR|5.0|&quot;Revolver&quot; is one of my favorite Beatles' collections.  The musical progress each Beatle has made is so evident in this collection.  The Eastern influence is very much a part of this collection; the fine sitar playing George Harrison is prominently featured in &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; and &quot;Love You, Too.&quot;  It is in fact George's contributions that make this collection so distinctly delightful.  His 1966 classic &quot;Taxman,&quot; is a scathing, satirical commentary of the times (&quot;Taxman, Mr. Wilson, Taxman, Mr. Heath&quot;).  The lyric, &quot;Now my advice for those who die/declare the pennies on your eye&quot; has a historical base.  During the Age of Antiquity, it was believed that departed souls entered the Underworld via ferry and that payment had to be made to Charon, the mythical ferryman.<br />&quot;I Want to Tell You&quot; is George Harrison at his best.  This highly developed, high caliber song has strong, vivid lyrics.  The guitar playing is rich and full; this particular song is a statement unto itself.  (I think it is the best song on this collection).  In short, the song is a plea for communication.<br />The Beatles are virtuosos at playing the full range of emotions from the light hearted &quot;Got to Get You Into My Life&quot; to the serious, somber &quot;I Want to Tell You&quot; and the sad, bittersweet &quot;Eleanor Rigby.&quot;<br />I Want to Tell You that this is a nonpareil, outstanding collection.  How can anybody not like this?  It is truly excellent!
B000002UAX|5.0|Yep, also, this is the best place to start with the Beatles, mainly because of its volume and diversity of songs.  The quality of the songs is as high as other Beatle albums such as Abbey Road, Revolver and Rubber Soul unlike some people will tell you.  This album deserves every second of its songs.  Paul is the star here with Back In The USSR, a mockery of the Beach Boys and Helter Skelter, the hardest song ever written, moreso than any Zep, Stones or Sabbath song I have ever heard.  This album is a masterpiece snd it easily deserves the highest rating possible, a 5/5
0393317552|4.0|Diamond's bestseller may be destined for a spot on the shelf next to Stephen Hawking's works - bought by millions of readers, most of whom seem only to get through a chapter or two.  That's a shame, because &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; is both accessible and important, but its 420 pages may be too much for those preferring quickie books to a modest challenge.<br />Diamond, a physiology professor at UCLA, writes about the rise of civilization, or more precisely, he asks why European civilization became so advanced that it was able to conquer other continents, rather than vice versa.  The guns, germs, and steel of the title are the tools of conquest used the by the europeans, but they aren't the answer.  The question goes back even further:  assuming that humanity arose from common African ancestors several million years ago, what set of factors allowed certain european and asian societies to develop the advanced weapons, virulent germs, and modern technology they used to subdue the other continents, rather than the other way around.  Diamond jumps off from the 1532 capture of the Inca emperor Atahuallpa by Pizarro and his tiny band of Spaniards, asking, &quot;Why did Pizarro capture Atahuallpa instead of Atahuallpa capturing or killing Pizarro?... How did Pizarro come to be there to capture him, instead of Atahuallpa's coming to Spain to capture King Charles I?&quot;.<br />The answer, as Diamond patiently and capably demonstrates, has nothing to do with racist notions of intelligence but comes down to the fact that prehistoric societies in the Fertile Crescent area of the middle east were blessed with a variety of plants and animals that could be domesticated and that eurasia is blessed with a long east-west axis.  That's pretty much it.  Sounds simple?  Well, it is and it isn't.  Cogently reviewing tools, agriculture, language, ecology, and a host of other scientific fields, Diamond shows how societies that produced food surpluses became large and sedentary and developed specialized classes of bureaucrats, priests, and craftspeople who created modern civilization and all the technologies and ideologies that supported exploration and conquest.<br />The book is not a scientific thesis full of academic jargon, but is a clear historical outline for the educated layperson.  It is designed to make the reader's job easy, with chapter summaries in the prologue and wrap-up paragraphs at the end of each chapter.  One quibble:  it could be shortened by one-third without sacrificing substance.  Diamond's patient explications can occasionally be repetitive or overlong.  Readers are constantly reminded of simple truths developed in earlier chapters, so that new ideas are slow in developing.  However, the thesis itself is thought-provokingly simple and probably unique for many readers.  Quite simply, it is a new and persuasive way of looking at the world.  Civilization as a function of environment.  Take the time to read the whole thing, it's well worth it.and developed specialized classes of bureaucrats, priests, and craftspeople who created modern civilization and all the technologies and ideologies that supported exploration and conquest.  <br />The book is not a scientific thesis full of academic jargon, but is a clear historical outline for the educated layperson.

B00005B6C9|5.0|I purchased this CD last spring and I am disappointed that it has not done better, however it is quite possible that people expected something quite different.  I first heard the title song...or at least a bit of it while viewing the Bee Gees on an episode of Biography. The song kept haunting me for months until it was finally released. Subsequently I caught the Bee Gees on Live By Request and again, heard more cuts from this CD. I finally purchased the CD and have listened to it a number of times.  It just gets better and better. Some of the reviews on Amazon indicate that there are fans who did not react positively to many of the cuts.  In particular, Robin's \\"Deja Vu\\", and Barry's \\"Technicolour Dreams\\".  Personally, I loved the change. This recording is a great example of how the three brothers posess individual talents, as well as being gifted collectively.  With that having been said, you just cannot deny the wonderfully unique sounds that emerge when they come together.  The Bee Gees individually, and collectively are just extremely talented people.
B00003CY0V|4.0|Felt like a mix of Matrix &amp; Speed with a bit of No Way Out thrown in. Overall, I very good movie that is definitely a watch for thriller/sci-fi fans. It seems illogical at times and has overblown images, but it's nothing gruesome/vivid like the images of Saving Private Ryan. As an old-married type, the wife could only take the first 5 minutes before she went on to better things. Not a date movie unless both are hard core sci-fi fans.
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya, without fail, produces beautiful sounding CDs and this is no exception. \\"Only Time\\" has proven to be very moving spiritually to me. Enya fans will not be disappointed.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|As a parent, this is one of the best movies ever for parents of kids 4 or over. Absolutely a riot with stuff you get that your kids dont. They really love it too. It's there with Emperor's Last Groove, Lion King, Bug's Life as recent classics.
B0000508U6|5.0|Wow...every time I hear that opening line to &quot;Don't Panic&quot;, a shiver is born. If only I could think of the words to describe the power each of the songs on this album has. After being introduced to this tapestry, I could do little but sit and let my mind wander into the fantasy world the cd had created. British accents, soft piano, and chords that resonate throughout the &quot;bones&quot;...wow. Buy this album! :-D
B00003CXDG|4.0|100 times better than MI 1. This one is a fun, fast, and enjoyable thriller with all the action needed to get no break at all. Its still very vague on plot line, but that didn't bother me. A very enjoyable watch.
B00005QW9V|5.0|This movie grabs you right away and doesn't let go until it's all over.  You have to love Hedwig.  Her story is tragic but she's not going to let that get her down.  This is one sassy, brassy character.  Jon Cameron Mitchell walks the fine line between outrageous and touching with grace and style.  He makes Hedwig a believable human being.  The music is great and the animation is really good too. This is entertainment with heart!
B00003CXXS|5.0|I loved all of the Jurassic Parks! Would have loved to find out that Sam's character had had children - but then I am a romantic!<br />Great nasty dinosaurs - love the commentaries!<br />The commentaries help me to understand what the movie makers are trying to accomplish and I appreciate the movie more.  Especially all the effort the actors put into their roles.<br />Everyone must listen to their own instincts and judge these movies themselves -- what is great for one is not for another!<br />I hardly ever agreed with Siskel and Ebert.<br />I am not one for overkill but I would like to see another follow-up in the near future.  Like yesterday! I hate waiting 3 or 4 years for a follow-up -- I may not get to see it.  Thanks guys for so much great entertainment.
B00005QKGM|2.0|Whether this opera stands or falls depend on whether we've got the right soprano in the title part. Unfortunately, Hildegard Behrens' unstable voice and chaotic lower register have failed to do the title part any justice. She doesn't command the part. Rysanek will a great force as Klytemnestra and the other roles are competently taken. However, the orchestral balance isn't that good, so is the general standard of the recorded sound. I'd suggest those who're interested in this dramatic opera to look elsewhere.
B00003CXTG|5.0|When this movie first came out my friends and I only went to see it because it had Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett in it.  The fact that it was about a defiant time in history didn't even came across to us.  But after seeing it i have to say we learned a lot both pearl harbor and WWII.   It's not like when your teachers tell you about it in class and all you want to do is sit back and fall asleep.  This movie brings you into the past to get a look at the lives of the soldiers of pearl harbor and how this event changed their lives.  True parts of it probably didn't happen, but if this movie was really as horrible as some people have reviewed it then it wouldn't have made as much money as it did.  And even some teachers that i have had commented on the historacle facts in the movie.  I would reccomend this to anyone who wants to learn about pearl harbor and everyone who doesn't.
B00005A46T|1.0|Who let these guys out the basement? Well, 7th grade boys love it. (I am shuure, totally.)Nobody ever lost money underestimating the taste and the intelligence of the American public. At least they aren't Korn. (Now that band really blows!)
B00004XOWN|4.0|Hey y'all,<br />This is arguably Limp Bizkit's best album yet. They have changed their sound slightly over the years, but the guys still come at ya hard and heavy with distinct, loud lyrics that would make a pop fan break his... Their first album 'Three Dollar bill, y'all' was pure metal and hard-rock, and they were to become revered for their works of hard-hitting songs. I personally enjoy 'Three Dollar bill, y'all,' the most out of all the albums, with the other two coming in at a very close second.<br />Their next album, 'Significant Other,' was to change how the world saw the Bizkit's forever. They now introduced rap-metal in their albums, for example the highly acclaimed track featuring Method Man, 'N2 Gether Now,' Which is more of a rap song than anything else, but still is a brilliant song in itself. They of course still had their traditional metal and hard-rock, for example, 'Break Stuff','Broke', and 'rearranged.'The Bizkit's then soured into fame, and then introduced the world to....<br />.... 'The Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavoured Water,' which featured much the same theme as 'Significant Other', except this time there are more guest appearances featuring artists such as 'DMX, Redman and X-zibit.'(featuring in the tracks 'Getch Groove on' and 'Rollin (Urban assault vehicle).'<br />Their most popular track off the album (and my best off the album) 'My Generation' was possibly one of the finest Bizkit songs I had ever heard. 'Take a look around (MI-2 theme)','Rollin (air raid vehicle)' and 'Boiler' are also some of the better rap-metal songs off the album, although other songs like 'Hot dog (Very EXPLICIT)' and 'It'll be OK' are also some amazing songs off the album.<br />In conclusion, if you're a Limp Fan, and you don't have the album....then, man, you are not a true Limp Bizkit Fan. Although Wes Borland hs left the band, (WHY,WHY,WHY????) the Bizkit's are still going strong, and with their new remix(ed) album, 'New Old Songs,' it looks as though the band will stay standin' firm. Anyway, that's it for now boys and girls, now be off with ya.<br />Farewell...the band will stay standin' firm. Anyway, that's it for now boys and girls, now be off with ya.<br />Farewell...
B00005U18E|1.0|I just saw Bridget Jones' Diary and I can't tell you how much I despised it and everything it had to say. All the women were idiotic, catty saboteurs and she was truly pathetic. Her diary, full of such searing insights as &quot;I HATE him!!!!!!!!&quot;, was something I would be embarrassed to have written when I was 14. <br />The low point of a movie full of low points was when her friends come by to take her on a surprise weekend to Paris and she blows them off when Colin Firth shows up - despicable!  Was I supposed to believe that the two of them are going to live happily ever after? I suspect that her bumbling, shallow, completely self absorbed silliness will soon wear thin for old sourpuss Mike Darcy and he'll dump her. She'll then console herself with binge drinking &amp; eating, bore her friends to tears with her endless nattering &amp; whining about relationships, and blow all of her money on more self help books. Is there nothing more to women, to life? I'm a woman, and I certainly believe so.<br />This book set the women's movement back 50 years.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I bought &quot;Planet Waves&quot; at 16 when Dylan began to tour again in 1973 and loved it (does anyone still listen to &quot;Planet Waves&quot;?) I immediately went out and got &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; and the whole Dylan archive.  Later, in college, I turned on all my friends to &quot;Blood on The Tracks&quot;. But then I lost Bob or moved on to something else.  I saw &quot;Love and Theft&quot; at the store and felt compelled to purchase it - I figured I'd listen once and store it away.  After one listen all I play is all 12 tracks of &quot;Love and Theft&quot; again and again.  Just as I used to listen to every track of &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; or &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot; or &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; over and over and over.<br />&quot;Love and Theft&quot; is warm, confident, challenging, breathtaking, and like all of Bob's great albums enhances our perception of America and of ourselves.  Where, oh where does this man come from and how can any one man be so blessed with talent?
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is the best movie i have ever seen Russell Crowe in. He did an excellent job. The attention to detail in this movie was also very good. I was glad to see how accurate they were in showing how the Roman army fought a battle in the opening battle scene of this movie. This is also the best movie i have ever seen dealing with the Roman empire, it is also the most detailed one. You can not go wrong with GLADIATOR, buy it today.
B00005RFVL|5.0|Robbie Williams' newest contribution to the music industry SWING WHEN YOU'RE WINNING has to be his best yet.  Robbie pays tribute to the best (Frank, Dean, Nat and Sammy) with his renditions of classic tracks like Mack The Knife, Do Nothing Till You Hear From Me, Staighten Up And Fly Right, Mr. Bojangles and my personal favorite, One For My Baby.  This revamped compilation, also, includes duets such as Somethin' Stupid (with Nicole Kidman), Well Did You Evah? (with Jon Lovitz), Me And My Shadow (with Jonathan Wilkes), It Was A Very Good Year (with Frank Sinatra), etc.  The CD, also, features an original Chambers/Williams tune entitled &quot;I Will Talk And Hollywood Will Listen&quot;.<br />Although this CD is unlike LIFE THRU A LENS, THE EGO HAS LANDED, I'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU, SING WHEN YOU'RE WINNING, Robbie's fans will not be disappointed as he takes a new turn of direction.  He still keeps the Robbie MAGIC flowing through each track.<br />Cheers to you, Robbie!  Here's hoping that you get the recognition that you deserve from the United States!
B00000DHRZ|3.0|damn you offspring,most of this cd is forgetable punk pop(staring at the sun) but you have put in a few absolute gems as well (americana,kids aren't alright) just to force us to get the album.pay the man incidently is the one of the worst punk songs ever.
0385505833|3.0|I was expecting something &quot;more&quot; from a John Grisham novel.  I found this one lacking in some respects.  There wasn't a &quot;punch&quot; or an &quot;oh wow&quot; moment at all!  Very lighthearted and &quot;quick reading&quot;, but didn't get any &quot;warm fuzzies&quot; from the book.
B00004XOWM|1.0|limp bizcuit are crap.sorry but thats the way it is there tried and tested formula of rap'n'nu-metal is growing increasingly old this cd just proves how dull they really are.has nobody noticed all the sings sound the same?obviously not as it has sold wagon loads.look somewhere else if yo want good nu-metal your not going to find it here.
630416923X|5.0|this is the best comprehensive look at the greatest band in the history of music.  it contains great behind the scenes footage.  if you enjoyed the Anthologies on CD, then you should not pass this up.  however, it should be coming out on dvd, so you might want to wait!!
B00000IPAX|4.0|this is punk its just an evolved version of the punk we heard being played by the sex pistols,for better or for worse its still punk.fortunatly is for better in this albums case,wondrerfully crafted songs played with verve and fun,not going to change the world but hey who cares really?
B00005QG9J|5.0|Morning View is yet another amazing CD from this California based band.  I became hooked on Incubus early 1998 when I purchased their S.C.I.E.N.C.E. CD because of a recomendation from a friend, and it has been fun to listen to the band evolve into the band that they have become today.  Morning View offers several wonderful songs ranging from the hit &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; to the extremely laid back ballad of &quot;Mexico.&quot;  For the people that discovered Incubus with their hit Drive will not be disapointed with Morning View's tracks, for those of you who have been listening to Incubus for years now might find Morning View a bit different than the usual (I know that I did).  The band has toned down their feel, and there is a significantly less distorted guitar sound throughout the whole CD, but still wonderful in it's own sort of way.  If you find the CD to be bad, spin it a few more times, and you will appreciate what it has to offer.
B00000DCHI|5.0|Best, best of album I've ever heard.<br />Usually even a &quot;best of&quot; has a few dogs.<br />Not this one!<br />For Billy Joel fans - pack up all those other CDs and just carry this one!
B000002BUY|5.0|This CD is the CD that got most of the die hard Incubus fans addicted to their unique sound.  From thrash metal songs such as &quot;A Certain Shade of Green&quot; and &quot;Calgone&quot; to the spacey jazz feel of &quot;Summer Romance&quot; (Summer Romance proves that the band can not only play hard, but can play soft as well) Icubus maintains a sound that is unique only to them, and allows you to identify their songs immediately.  Although the feel isn't the same from song to song this is how Incubus grabs a hold of your attention and won't let go.  Whether you are a hard rock fan, or a fan of heavy metal this CD is sure to please your taste for this genre of music, and if you're new to Incubus or heavy metal this CD is a definate buy for you.
0060012331|5.0|For &quot;The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents&quot;, Terry Pratchett's 28th Discworld book, he states in the Author's Note at the end that he did a lot of research into rats before writing this book.  It shows.<br />This also marks Pratchett's first Discworld book for the young adult set.  It actually serves as a pretty good introduction to the Discworld, giving us an entirely new set of characters to play with thart aren't bogged down in the already established Discworld cosmology (save the necessary cameo by Death, the famous anthropomorphic personification).<br />The story is a spin, obviously, on The Pied Piper of Hamlin, but with Pratchett's usual fairy-tale-crashes-head-on-into-real-world take on things.  The rats (and cat) talk - and scheme and scam - but do so in a way completely at odds with the standard Disney-like children's book characters.  They're really more characters trying to come to terms with being saddled with things they never wanted - like sentience - than anthropomorphic animals.  In fact, stories like Peter Cottontail (and the Brothers Grimm) are parodied throughout the book.<br />In keeping with Pratchett's previously mentioned belief in previous books that kids are just as capable (if not more, in some cases) of dealing with nastiness, death and general unpleasantness, Pratchett doesn't really pull any punches in his narrative.  He treats rats as they really are - smelly, foul, incontinent sometime cannibals.  That's not to say that, like all of his protagonists, they're not actually good beings - they're just not cute, fluffy and sweet.<br />However, all this said, it's still a story about humankind - and ratkind - triumphing over it's baser beliefs and practices.  It's a great story and which, as with all of Pratchett's best books - deals out humor, suspense and creepiness in equal measure.  I recommend it for kids, adults, Discworld fans and those new to the series.  It's as good as any Discworld book he's done so far and it doesn't need the established background to tell a great story.
B00005BJMQ|5.0|I was most impressed with the movie, but was astounded when listening to the soundtrack that it stands up all by itself. I don't even like half of these songs &lt;especially dislike &quot;Your Song&quot;&gt; in their original releases, but this soundtrack has taken on a life of it's own, and is a must-have for any contemporary music collection.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I rented this movie this past weekend and ended up watching it 4 times. I just couldn't stop watching. The only other movie I watched repeatly after the first viewing was the Matrix. The style was so unique and refreshing. Not knowing what will happen next, and when it all came together at the end, you immediately had to watch again because you couldn't believe your eyes. One cool feature on the DVD would be the option to watch the movie in the forward sequence, maybe like after so many viewings the option would be unlocked.<BR>The acting was superb! Guy Pearce did an excellent job, as well as Carrie-Ann Moss and John Pantoliano. You could feel the frustration and confusion Leonard was feeling as he tried to piece together the fragments of his brief memories. The dark scenes in the motel room were haunting as the puzzle of events were being linked together. The Sammy Jankis part of the story gave credibility to his 'condition'. Totally fasinating movie. I'm adding this DVD to my collection right after Christmas. Who knows, it may be under the tree right now. Cool!
B000002NAK|5.0|At first when I saw the movie, I thought what the heck had I just seen? All these people who keep singing and singing non-stop and this central figure, a woman by the name of Eva Duarte/Peron... I came out of the cinema utterly disappointed. But then I had a revelation the next day when I went to school, my friend told me that Evita was actually a MUSICAL. Not having a single clue what a musical was, I did a bit of research myself and found out that the composer was Andrew Lloyd Webber and the lyricist, Tim Rice, both big names in the business I was told. So with this info in mind and a short synopsis of the film, I marched into the cinema again and watched Evita again but this time, I finally understood what the whole show was about. I mean, I was crying at the end of the show when the windows of Evita's room became darkened... I was devastated. Most of the songs in the show stuck on me like superglue especially that &quot;Eyes, hair, mouth, make-up&quot; bit and I was humming them when the show ended so I rushed to the nearest CD shop and bought this recording. Upon arrival at my home, I listened eagerly to the first disc on my discman and wow, was I blown away. I got to understand the story a bit better by following the lyrics and playing the songs repeatedly, something you can't do at the cinema or theater. The lyrics are compelling most of the time but at some points you really cannot fathom the use of certain lyrics. <br />Madonna's vocal performance is awesome, I believe she performed best on the recording than any of her previous or later recordings since the role of Evita required extensive vocal range and was demanding both vocally and acting-wise. She is great in all her big numbers but &quot;Don't cry for me Argentina&quot; and &quot;You must love me&quot; must receive special attention. Through Madonna's husky yet fragile voice, we feel Evita's unfailing attempts to garner the people's acceptance of her and of Peron as well and we sympathise with her plights. <br />Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce shine wonderfully in their respective roles and who ever knew our budding Zorro could actually sing and quite well at that! (Though I still believe he is totally wrong for the role of the Phantom) The ensemble cast used in the crowds and aristocracy have a wonderful big chorus feel to them and all of them look and act quite well as the Argentine citizens. When they cried at Eva's death, I cried with them... <br />Great cast &amp; great music (very lush orchestrations). A wonderful combination. However, to get the ultimate Evita experience, get this recording first, then the London cast and then the Broadway cast. Or just buy them all!
B000000JO3|5.0|Pioneers of the DC Hardcore movement , and the band to bring the straight edge lifestyle to the table. This band was totally alien to the punk rock image of the past..anti drugs , anti alcohol , anti smoking , anti sex...but..anti christian as well.<BR>This band at that time cut what it meant to be defiant and punk down the middle. They did away with the whole junkie drunk punks who wasted their lives strung out on dope type of image. This was a band that could speak of these values of sober living , but could also carve out some extremely brutal music as well. This discography captures Minor Threats career from the first LP to the last EP. Every punker straight edge or not should own this piece of history in their collection.

Then it slowly picks up pace,<BR>and towards the end there is a beautiful piano. The next song is I Might Be<BR>Wrong, it is a very distinct song, with an almost twangy guitar. Knives Out<BR>is an up tempo song, with amazing guitars, something that is nice to hear on<BR>a Radiohead album. Morning Bell/Amnesiac is far better then its Kid A<BR>counterpart. It is much more desperate, and without the drums there is<BR>nothing holding the song together except Thom's vocals. Dollars and Cents is<BR>all right, nothing amazing though. The next two songs aren't that good,<BR>Hunting Bears is nothing but a glorified guitar solo and in Like Spinning<BR>Plates you can't even understand Thom's vocals. The last song is my favorite<br />song on Amnesiac, Life in a Glass House. It sounds like nothing Radiohead has<BR>ever done, nor will ever do. It is hard to describe, it has a piano,<BR>trumpets, the whole works. It is a depressing song, it is like Thom saying<BR>good-bye to an era of his music.<br />Amnesiac is a collection of amazing songs, while Kid A is a work of art. What<BR>sets Amnesiac apart from Kid A is the emotion. Amnesiac is a worthy addition<BR>to any good album collection.<br />-John
B00003CXN3|1.0|Why? Why? Why? was this movie considered a great accomplishment and an in depth study on the war on drugs. This movie was nothing more than boring , and long , and I found myself dozing off here and there during it. The only interesting story was Douglas and his daughter , the mexican cop , and the druglord's wife were boring and a waste of film. If the movie was about the czar and his daughter it may have earned at least 3 stars , and whats worse it'll switch characters to characters like about every minute , so you can't keep up with it. A 3 hr waste of time even though it had one of the coolest lines when the actor from That 70's Show and the czar's daughter are on the bed smoking heroin. Whats even more disgusting this film won an Oscar. It's trash like this that try to be groundbreaking and prove a point of some kind , but does nothing more than suck 3 hrs out of your life. Nauseating dribble

Then it slowly picks up pace,<BR>and towards the end there is a beautiful piano. The next song is I Might Be<BR>Wrong, it is a very distinct song, with an almost twangy guitar. Knives Out<BR>is an up tempo song, with amazing guitars, something that is nice to hear on<BR>a Radiohead album. Morning Bell/Amnesiac is far better then its Kid A<BR>counterpart. It is much more desperate, and without the drums there is<BR>nothing holding the song together except Thom's vocals. Dollars and Cents is<BR>all right, nothing amazing though. The next two songs aren't that good,<BR>Hunting Bears is nothing but a glorified guitar solo and in Like Spinning<BR>Plates you can't even understand Thom's vocals. The last song is my favorite<br />song on Amnesiac, Life in a Glass House. It sounds like nothing Radiohead has<BR>ever done, nor will ever do. It is hard to describe, it has a piano,<BR>trumpets, the whole works. It is a depressing song, it is like Thom saying<BR>good-bye to an era of his music.<br />Amnesiac is a collection of amazing songs, while Kid A is a work of art. What<BR>sets Amnesiac apart from Kid A is the emotion. Amnesiac is a worthy addition<BR>to any good album collection.
0553712837|4.0|Although this book was lacking in some areas, it was a very simple and cute story.  It is great for book lovers, who during the holiday season don't have much time to read.  It was a quick read, but ultimately left a good feeling with me.
0618135871|5.0|I just finished reading Roth's latest novel and I'm nearly literally bowled over by it.  Some absolutely amazing writing, certainly some of the best writing on sex and sexuality I've ever encountered.  (There is, of course, a great deal of very bad writing about sex and so it's such a pleasure to encounter someone who writes about it with such verve and style as Roth does.) This little book is a huge achievement because it captures the tension between eros and thanatos....the forces of life and death that pull us one way and another in life.  Roth is especially good at capturing the consciousness of an aging male psyche-which his of course is-and of showing us the amazing sexual force that animates nearly all life on this planet.  It is a disturbing book as well, because it shows us how fully connected we are to the lives of our bodies, and how tragic it is when those bodies begin to give us intimations of our mortality.  The turn at the book's conclusion is especially surprising and a reminder that those intimatations can come at any time in life.  Don't miss this book.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I've seen a lot of movies, but none can compare to Moulin Rouge, starring my favorite starlett Nicole Kidman.  The music, romance, freedom, beauty, and all the other wonderful aspects that create Moulin Rouge make it my number one fave movie!  The moment I saw it, i fell in love with the story and the music.  I immediatly bought the soundtrack and have all the songs memorized!  But what I love most about the movie would have to be Nicole Kidman. Me and my best friend are absolutley in love with her.  She is my idol! She's gorgeous, a talented actress, a loving mother, and a talented singer.  If it weren't for this movie, the world might never have discovered the singing star in Nicole.  The plot shows that love can prevail through anything.  The best line is how Christian, Ewan McGregor, lives his life: &quot;The greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return.&quot;  I saw the movie for a second time, and the ending of the movie still made me cry.  This movie is the best I've ever seen, and anyone who loves to love, sing, dance, and e entertained will agree with me!

0048200158|3.0|I read THE HOBBIT, THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, THE TWO TOWERS, and THE RETURN OF THE KING.  I even read BORED OF THE RINGS, a parody by Harvard Lampoon Staff, to get my mind back as it was so easy to get caught up in the huge popularity of these books.  People I knew, otherwise sane people were spelling their dog's name in runes for the love of Pete.<br />But ready to read on and find the ancient truth according to J.R.R., I bought the latest release from the late Tolkien, a collection of short stories and poems by the master and dived in.  Eventually I came out of my reverie enough to realize I had read a book with the breathtaking title:  TREE AND LEAF ; SMITH OF WOOTON MAJOR ; THE HOMECOMING OF BEORHTNOTH, BEORHTHELM'S SON, I also realized that I had gone too far and that was as far as I was going.  There was a big clue here that I was caught up in Tolkienmania.<br />The one story I really enjoyed was the touching tale, TREE AND LEAF.  I often think of Leaf by Niggel and the point made that we find our own importance in the details we take care of and how much care we take in them.  This was from the sensitive side of Tolkien that in HOBBIT and THE TRILOGY made the descriptions of the Hobbits and other good guys and the dynamics between them so compelling.  The comradery and rejoicing in and uplifting of each other gave them the strength to carry on the fight.  Well here's little Niggel, thinks he's not important until the praise of another brings his true worth, just how he is needed, into focus.  This is so valid in these days of superstars which most of us aren't.  In a way the media tells up we've failed if we're not on the cover of TIME.  Well it's BS that everyone gets 15 minutes.  And if you do get 15 minutes look out; it could turn out to be 15 minutes of infamy and that's never forgotten, true or not.<br />As for the rest of the book, it was a grab for the gold; one of the many thrown-together, half-finished  shorts medleys touted as J.R.R. Tolkien, &quot;before Middle Earth&quot; but should have been &quot;before the big bucks&quot; or &quot;even if he's dead, we're gonna make some bread&quot;.  I'm not sure but I think this was the first of this genre.  The book, mercifully, went out of print soon after it was printed (never went to paperback) and the price for a used copy now starts at, well, much more than it cost new!  I wish I?d have bought every copy I could find but who could guess such a mediocre olio would go up in price.<br />Oh, I went back on my decision to stop supporting the machine that was publishing what Tolkien chose not to publish while alive when I was loaned a copy of THE SIMARILLION in the mid-seventies.  I read about half of it and decided I had better reads on the shelf.  <br />Yes I'm going to see the movie.  I saw the huge failure of a movie in the seventies.  I'm considering spending the time to reread HOBBIT and THE TRILOGY to refresh my memory so I can properly appreciate, or trash, the new film.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Come on! People who say they like this movie are probably 14 year old girls who cried their eyes out when Josh Hartnett died at the end! Aside from the fact that all it is a sappy love story that just happens to be set in 1941. Why people thought they should make a love story about such a horrible day is a horrible idea in itself. That would be like making a movie about 2 people that fall in love and then get killed in the Sept 11 disaster! Except for the wonderful action scenes, this movie was downright bad! The only Oscar I hope it wins is for best special effects!

B00005N9CV|1.0|If you're awake, it will put you to sleep. If you're sleeping, it could kill you. There should be warning labels about using this CD in your car stereo. If you're a Diana Krall fan, you should probably pass on this one. I thought it was a bad choice of songs. S'boring.
6304057709|5.0|The enormously talented Emma Thompson wrote the marvelous screenplay for this brilliant adaptation of Jane Austen's novel of the same name. Ms. Thompson rightly won a Academy Award for Best Screenplay for her efforts. The film itself, first class in every respect, received seven Academy Award nominations and was named Golden Globe Best Picture of the Year.<br />The film revolves around the two Dashwood sisters, the passionate and highly impetuous Marianne (Kate Winslet) and the more conformist and restrained Elinor (Emma Thompson), who have had a sudden reversal of fortune, having been left impoverished upon the death of their father. Their financial condition is exacerbated by the evil machinations of their sister in law, Fanny Dashwood (Harriet Walter), who manipulates her husband, their half brother, into pinching pennies with them, causing them no end of hardship.<br />This nineteenth century tale of morals and manners details the romantic trials and tribulations of the Dashwood sisters. Marianne falls in love with a scoundrel, John Willoughby (Greg Wise), who leaves her high and dry for a woman with a fortune. Meanwhile, the kind and courteous Col. Brandon (Alan Rickman) falls in love with Marianne and suffers from unrequited love for some time, until Marianne regains her senses. Elinor falls in love with Edwards Ferrars (Hugh Grant), her evil sister in law's brother, and he with her, but many obstacles to their pairing are interposed along the way. All comes out right in the end, however, but it is the getting there that makes this film a must see.<br />A witty, funny, and romantic film, it boasts a first class  ensemble cast. While Ms. Thompson may be a bit long in the tooth for the role which she plays, her thespian talents and charm enable her to pull the proverbial rabbit out of the hat. Beautifully directed by Ang Lee, this film should top the list of those who love Jane Austen and those who adore superlative period pieces.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Imagine you're 9000 miles from home.  You're walking down the street, alone, at night, and as you pass a record shop, you hear an ethereal, almost jazz-like riff come into focus.  It stops you in your tracks.  Then a warbly tenor floats in above the instruments... &quot;I want you to know... He's not coming back...&quot;  The voice is delicate but insistent.  This is Knives Out.  This is your introduction to the new Radiohead.<br />So that was how it happened for me.  Granted, not everyone can have such a unique and appropriate first contact with Amnesiac.  But it's not the situation that makes the music... It's the music that makes the situation.<br />I owned and enjoyed OK Computer, like so many people.  But I didn't bat an eye when Kid A came out (&quot;Oh look, more of those spiky mountain posters at the record shop... whatever.&quot;)  So the whole Amnesiac thing was the new Radiohead sound, as far as I was concerned.  Therefore, I didn't come to this &quot;tainted&quot; by the notion that it's a Kid A outtake (which is entirely untrue anyway -- the albums were made at the same time and assembled as such because that's how they made sense, not because Radiohead decided a few months after Kid A that they might as well toss the bloody chunk leftovers out for the raving fan-sharks to shred).  This is a beautiful, moving album in its own right.  Almost every song is remarkable, filled to the brim with that combination of yearning, epiphany, and disconnect that only Radiohead can concoct.<br />Pyramid song, You and whose army?, I might be wrong, Knives out, Dollars and cents, Like spinning plates -- these are some of the best songs I have ever heard.  Ever.  This album made me a Radiohead fan.  And if you need guidance, just look to the directions on the album's back cover: &quot;Store away from direct sunlight, preferably in a dark drawer with your secrets.  See inside for details.&quot;  This album knows all your hidden selves, and it will find them if only you surrender.
B000002JST|5.0|This one is my favourite AC/DC album yet so far (Havent heard High Voltage or Highway To Hell though).Its pure rockn roll from beginning to end with an energy and raw power that is hard to resist. The title track is the best on the album and probably their best song ever, featuring killer solos by Angus Young and a good fast tempo which I love. In fact there are no bad songs on this album but tracks that standout(besides the title track) are &quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot;, &quot;Bad Boy Boogie&quot; and &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;.<BR>This is a must have for fans of early AC/DC and rocknroll in general, and you will surely headbang or play air-guitar at least a couple of times.
B00005RDAF|4.0|This collection of Britney videos is nothing special. It only consists of 4 videos for I'm A Slave 4 U, I'm Not A Girl, Don't Let me Be the Last to Know, and Overprotected(which is only outakes from her film Crossroads)Also included is the Pepsi commercial( which we all have seen a thousand times) and her sexy performance of Slave on the MTV awards. It is still a must have for all Britney haves but you really wont see anything you haven't seen already on MTV. It is anice to have them all on one tape. I wish there were more behind the scenes, more interviews, and more live performances. Britney is at her best when performing live and that is certainly missing form this. Still, you gotta love Britney and of the clips included, they are worth it.
0385505833|5.0|This work juxtaposes the commercial trappings of the sacred holiday with the true Christmas spirit, social interference with human interdependence, individual freedoms with community obligations, and it does so by satirizing the monolithic conventions of conformity. One clever touch: the out-of-synch protagonist's surname, Krank, means &quot;sick&quot; in German, and, although he and his family are portrayed as Roman Catholics, his first name, Luther, clearly suggests a budding Protestantism, expressed not by nailing documents to a church door but by distributing among his office co-workers a memo detailing his intended non-observance. In all, a gem.
B00005OWIU|5.0|I love this soundtrack. It defenatily tops my list of good soundtracks. I like Hedwig's theme the most.
B00003CXTG|3.0|Pearl Harbor has a horrendous love story, then an exciting bombing scene, and then a totally unnecessary Doolittle retaliation. Solution: Buy both the PH and the TTT DVDs, take TTT, split it into scenes, do the same with PH, throw away all the bad and useless scenes from PH (that is, the love story and the Doolittle raid), splice them together. Result? A 3.5 hours SUPERMOVIE. TTT adds the true historical side to the event, PH adds the realistic side. That's a movie that I would not miss for nothing in the world, and since Hollywood is NEVER going to make such a movie, I decided to do exactly that, do all the splicing myself (sorry, guys, it's for private viewing at home only, otherwise the legal dogs will be barking at my door).
B00005OWIU|5.0|I love this soundtrack. It defenatily tops my list of good soundtracks. I like Hedwig's theme the most.
B00005U2LM|5.0|After their last album, the W, Wu fans were left dumbfounded and a little bit confused. With the unpredictable beats and sometimes-not-rhyming words, the W was truly an experiment. Now, with the Iron Flag, they are obviously stating that the wu hasn't gone anywhere, and isn't planning on going. I give this album a five star rating because it's an instant classic and is an album you listen to all the way through and fail to find any weak spots.
B000002J03|5.0|It could probably be claimed that Led Zeppelin never regained the soul and authenticity of their brilliant debut album, but musically they've come a long way from the first album to this second offering, which is quite incredible considering that it was released only nine months later (In our times, when most rock groups release an album every two to three years, it's easy to be amazed by artists who would release two albums a year). Most importantly, only one song on this album is a classic-blues cover version, compared to three on the first album. Accordingly, the band somewhat abandoned the pure blues-rock attitude of the first album in favor of a more contemporary style, heavy rock with traces of blues in it, simplified blues rhythms twisted into energetic, electric power metal; I consider this album the main bringer of heavy metal as we know it.<br />The main cause of the change is probably the growth in lead singer Robert Plant's part in the writing: Note that on the first album he is only credited as co-arranger on their version of Anne Bredon's 'Babe I'm Gonna Leave You', while on the second he's credited as co-writer on all the songs except for 'Moby Dick' (on which I'll expand later). Of course he never had the musical abilities to write decent songs on his own (he never did on his solo albums either. He usually collaborated with guitarist Robbie Blunt), but while the first album was dominated by Jimmy Page and the blues sound he loved so much (which also dominated the Page-era music of the Yardbirds), Plant's collaboration on the second album's tracks gave them something of his own taste, a heavy pop-rock flavor, which combined wonderfuly with Page's blues feel. This refreshingly unique combination makes LZ II much more energetic and enjoyable than the first. On the other hand it's also very raw, while the albums made after it tended to be softer in sound and in production; the one ballad on the album, 'Thank You', does little to release its tense, heavynature. It still retains much of the bluesy feeling of the first album, which is very strong on 'The Lemon Song' and the Willie Dixon classic 'Bring It On Home'. To me, it's the peak of Led Zeppelin's celebrated career.<br />With three exceptions - the soft, beautiful 'Thank You', the brief, fast, enjoyable 'Living Loving Maid' and the mediocre 'Lemon Song' (my least favorite track on the album) - every single track on Led Zeppelin II stands by its own right as a deep, powerful, well-written and well-performed rock number. The best known tracks are 'Whole Lotta Love' and 'Heartbreaker', both of them fantastic songs. 'Whole Lotta Love' remains one of LZ's best songs, delivered wonderfuly by Robert in his powerful, primal, almost orgasmic screaming/singing voice (which has a lot in common with Janis Joplin's) including a fantastic, semi-psychedelic instrumental jam from Jimmy. 'Heartbreaker' is an excellent, fast heavy-metal number with just a trace of blues in it. My favorites on the album, though, are 'What Is And What Should Never Be', a brilliant song by Page and Plant, powered up by excellent work from John Paul Jones and John Bonham (a bass player and a drummer of the best in the field); and more importantly, 'Moby Dick', a superb instrumental track which is essentialy a four minute drum solo delivered brilliantly by the master 'Bonzo' Bonham - not what you'd usually expect from a heavy-metal drum solo (a fast, heavy, skillful drum-beating frenzy) but instead an original, thoughtful piece of music like few rock drummers can make. 'Moby Dick' is one of the finest pieces of drumming in rock history, and it alone would make this album essential listening.<br />Without any pretence of artistic prog.-metal (LZ III) or classic blues-rock (LZ I), without sophisticated nine minute songs (Stairway To Heaven), this relatively raw, straightforward rock album remains the best in it genre, and proves that Led Zeppelin were indeed a great band (even if they did lose much of their edge after the third album, and the rest of it after Physical Graffitty). A powerful, energetic, enjoyable rock album, the classic masterpiece of heavy-metal. An album recommended for all. All you thrash-death-black-grunge-alternative rock fans out there: appreciate the classics. Get this CD.

B000002G26|3.0|The music of Bryan Adams brings back some extremely pleasurable memories of the `80s for me, but this colletion falls far short of its claim! Where  are &quot;Lonely Nights,&quot; &quot;Tonight,&quot; &quot;The Only One&quot;? And wy reprise 3 tracks off the already played-to-death &quot;Reckless&quot;? Including cuts like &quot;The Best Was Yet To Come&quot; or &quot;What's Gonna Be?&quot; would have made more sense. And only 1 TRACK from  &quot;Into The Fire'? Why wasn't &quot;Hearts On Fire&quot; put on here?! Any single release thas has &quot;Summer Of '69 and &quot;Cuts Like A Knife&quot; in 1 place can't be a total washout, but this CD could ave been so much more!
B000002WYT|5.0|Some people might wonder what all the fuss over Dave Mathews Band is. Especially now that his new stuff is a bit more focused on his recreational drug use. <br />Nevertheless, pick up Crash. It contains some of the band's most thoughtful work and it's smooth, mellow and a CD you'll be bopping your head to for months.
B000002C1W|3.0|And as with The Final Cut another decent one but for different reasons. With Roger gone Dave and Co. finally got the chance to show what they could come up with and what they delivered was a FAR from great but still above average album.<br />There's no concept for the first time since 1972's Obscured By Clouds. But don't let that put you off.<br />A New Machine Parts 1&amp;2 and The Dogs Of War are awful, Yet Another Movie/Around And Around is dull. However the rest of the album gets it just right. The instrumental tracks Terminal Frost and Signs Of life are good and whilst On The Turning Away does seem a little bit out of place it's still an enjoyable track. Learnign To Fly is a decent and popular &quot;single&quot; and finally Sorrow and One Slip not only prove that the band still have the ability to come up with memorable and genuinely great music Gilmour proves with these two songs that WHEN he tries he CAN write decent lyrics.
B00000ILBK|5.0|While the last 2 &quot;Next Generation&quot; movies were good entries in the series, I regard this one as a very excellent film because it does go back the spirit of what the show meant to us. In &quot;First Contact&quot; we got to see Captain Picard(Patrick Stewart) be a man of action, but in this film we see the &quot;Real Picard&quot; when when he must defy Starfleet to save a race known as the Bak'u. The theme is very-light-hearted as we learn the Bak'u inhabit a fountain of youth planet which means millions of Federations citizens will benefit from its regenerative qualities. However, this will mean that Starfleet must force the Bak'u off the planet. Picard's only hope in both preserving the dignity of Starfleet, and preserving the peaceful Bak'u is none other than to rebel. Great feeling of home with the other TNG charaters, and Riker(Jonathon Frakes)&amp; Troi(Marina Sirtis) renew their love for each other. What makes it even better is F. Murray Abraham's performance as the vengeful Ru'afo. I can't wait for the crew to come back in the next movie to be called &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis!&quot;
B000006TRV|4.0|As far as Rock Operas go this is indeed a fine work of art. However it's neither the best Rock Opera ever made or even Pink Floyd's best album (Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here and The Division Bell ALL are better albums).<br />The Wall has several problems:<br />1 - It's lead characer Pink is an instantly dislikable &quot;hero&quot; for<BR>    our story. Pathetic, sad and loathesome. He refuses to accept<BR>    HE is responsible for his problems and likes to blame <BR>    everyone else.<BR>2 - No input from Rick and minimal input from Dave. Roger was <BR>    more or less running the show at this point. And while that's<BR>    fine from a Lyrics standpoint it's NOT good from a musical <BR>    standpoint. Large portions of the album are tame musically.<BR>3 - Confusing Narrative. It's almost impossible to follow <BR>    sometimes. It's a rock opera for goodness sake. You should be<BR>    able to follow it with relative ease. But you can't.<br />It's Far from all bad. In fact for the most part it is actually quite good. It is a VERY good album. But not quite the faultless creature many claim. There are many good songs including the bands best known (another brick in the wall part 2) and the bands BEST EVER song (Comfortably Numb).<br />It is definitley an album EVERYONE should own and it is VERY GOOD. I feel it's just a shame it's the second best known and bough Floyd album out there when as I said earlier they have better albums on the market which no-one pays a second glance.
0440234743|2.0|This is the first John Grisham book I have read. I am sure there are diehard fans out there who say I should start with The Firm or something. The point is that this is as descripitive as Dick And Jane. I feel nothing for any of these characters, and what could be entertaining scenes skip by in three sentences. He doesn't bring you into the story. He just lets you look at it like a fish in a fishbowl. And just as entertaining.The first Chapter pulls you in to the possibilities of the outcome, but after that it's just a simple mindless read. He is definitely a writer second and a lawyer first.
B00005QDW5|3.0|The Best Of Pink Floyd?????. Hmmm that's a bold statment. Whilst I cannot argue with the rather amazing remixing and editing which puts the songs across sounding crisper and cleaner than ever. And whilst I cannot argue with MOST of the songs selected. I can still slap this fish about a little bit and will.<br />First off whilst I can appreciate Syd getting acknowledged I think he gets OVERACKNOWLEDGED!. Heck he get's more acknowledgement on here than Rick does!!!!!.<br />A few minor tweaks and this could have been perfect. Take out See Emily Play, Hey You, Set The Controls......, Us And Them, Jugband Blues and Bike and in their place slap on the far superior Paintbox, Nobody Home, Free Four, Run Like Hell, Two Suns In Sunset and Green Is The Colour. <br />This album was SUPPOSEDLY not for the fans and meant for the general public. I think the general public would have a better time listening to Run Like Hell than Bike. And I have my doubts that this claim of it being for the general public is truthfull. The introduction of When The Tigers Broke Free is a BLATANT &quot;Any spare change Mr Floydian?&quot; excercise.<br />Not bad by any means. Other classics such as Time, Comfortably Numb, Echoes, Sorrow, Sheep and Arnold layne are deservedly on here. But it could have been a wee bit better.
0385505833|5.0|I loved this book! I chuckled and giggled the whole way through, because it was so true to life!<br />Grisham's focus on the obscenity of Christmas overspending is right on target.<br />Yes, it was predictable, and hoaky, and maybe even a bit shallow, but it was a terrific read.<br />As far as The Krank's concern over their daughter's engagement to a Peruvian (dark skinned), I think that was part of the whole hypocrisy aspect that Grisham was trying to show.  Here they were going to a tanning bed to make themselves darker, but were concerned that their daughter was marrying a dark skinned person.<br />I read it in about 4 hours, and it was wonderful. I can't wait for it to be made into a movie; my friends and I at work are taking bets on who gets the leady roles.  I'm thinking Gene Hackman for Luther, and Goldie Hawn for his wife....<br />Great Christmas Reading!
B00005QXXO|3.0|I now hate to use the cliche &quot;worth it just for such and such track alone,&quot; but &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; makes this &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; EP, well, worth it for that track alone. The gentle piano intro is used instead of the studio-refined whipping, spinning sound and it works a treat. The song is imbued with gut-wrenching soul and an emotional intensity that was missing from most of &quot;Amnesiac&quot;. This live rendition of LSP is one of Radiohead's stronger post-OK Computer efforts. When he wants to use it, Thom Yorke has the most stirring set of pipes in rock and I get chills listening to him hit those high notes. However the rest of the cd is so-so. &quot;Everything In It's Right Place&quot; was a standout on &quot;Kid A&quot; but here its a disappointment. What made the song work on the album oddly enough, was it's sombre tone and creepy keyboard loops. The ambience seems to have diminished from the song being performed to a quicker tempo and Thom affecting lively and upbeat vocals. &quot;True Love Waits&quot; is an acoustic number and it isn't really a &quot;new&quot; track. It seems to be a fan favourite, but it's mediocre Radiohead, at best. Most of the songs don't vary greatly from the studio versions. This EP isn't really essential unless you want to own everything Radiohead puts out.
