B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I love this freakin show! Best show ever! Hilarious and damn scary too! Sam and Dean are compelling characters that experience some majorly fantastic events and do some awesome things.  Everybody should try supernatural.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved all 3 books. I thought there was a good plot and lots of really great sex. Will definitely reread these again.
B00BP4X3W2|2.0|We all need to move on from this tragedy of life and think forward.<br /><br />It didn't hold my attention very long.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Amazing book. I wish that some the stories would have been longer, but all in all I hear enjoyed it.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|pretty good app however sometimes it doesn't connect to paypal when I am trying to pay for something. other than that its actually a pretty great.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I've been playing this game for quite a few years, and all I can say is that it keeps getting better :)
B005LAIH2M|5.0|I love the actors and the movie wasn't too corny, it was a little scary. The story was not for children, from the beginning and definitely the movie even more.
B007QJ8VBI|5.0|Beside being a good story, it is okay to watch when you have kids around.<br />It was also very funny.
B006P0WMBO|5.0|I already love Super Collapse, no doubt. But I especially love this cute Holiday edition. It give you all the challenges of Collapse of the past, but this time snowy. It's a little much to say it follows a storyline, but it does (the same as the others haha) that an alien of some sort has crashed and you have to defeat different boss levels. This levels get harder and add new colors. But it's great and a fun to solve problems.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This story touched my heart.  I think most people have felt these emotions at some time in their life.  Very touching.  Movie was good but the. Book was better.

0060853980|5.0|Just one of the great hopeful books of all time. Young boys and their dogs are the chaotic forces in the universe...and if not all good then vastly satisfying in their dealings with angels and demons... Very endearing book.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|A great story as always.  I feel she went a little too far with descriptions in some of her chapters , loved it anyway.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever I recommend it for every one almost like temple run another good game is beat the boss
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|So far this one has kept my attention. I am happy that it is not timed because i have had to really think on some of them. Good for a break from the fast paced carnival type games.
0345529057|5.0|Having watched the series religiously, it seemed natural to order the set, to see what was left out, already I have a better view of things, like who is Jon Snow's mother was although still a mystery it is intriguing ...And other goodies
B0041T52S6|5.0|I have always been a fan of Scott Pilgrim and actually buying it for such a cheap price was great. This movie was the bomb dot com and I've even got a few of my friends into it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Definitely seeing results and it's only been a week! It's very intense, so be prepared. I would recommend this DVD
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Excellent book and an easy, intriguing read. Couldn't stop reading once I started, and I did not want the book to end.
B00CN4C0OK|5.0|The clean vocals threw me off, but after a couple of listens I really started to dig it. Awesome masterpiece
B008ZVNC2O|5.0|Brilliant record! I love the whole record. Mick Hucknall is one of the best voices ever! I love all his work and it's seems to get better and better.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie - underrated - packaging was good - received in great condition.  Definitely recommend if one loves action - very good cast of actors.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|At first I was a little intimidated by the volume of pages.  As has been the habit of Stephen King, brevity is not his strong suit.  Why tell a story in 250 pages when you can go on for 1000.  But as I got into the story, it flowed well.  The strong suit of King's work is his character development and that is evident throughout this work.  The alternate universe is one that I haven't seen much from King and he plays it well in this story.  The ending was satifying for me, even after all that the characters went through.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Gregory Porter is one of the best voices on the scene today - every song is awesome - love this CD - playing it to death - received in great condition - packaging was very protective - will be ordering more of Gregory Porter - he stole my heart.

B008JFUO36|5.0|Excellent movie, very underrated - received DVD in excellent condition - packaging was very good.  Must watch several times to get the true understanding of the movie.  Loved it.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|Great reading for everyone, of any size. Michaels insights based on various doctors opinions will extent many people's lives. Thank you
B008602KQI|5.0|Love this DVD; it was received in excellent condition - packaging was protective.  Great movie - hope it is not a portent of the future.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|To little of this movie was spent explaining what, to me, was the central plot point - the conflict between the humans and the aliens.  Instead, that juicy morsel was just a backdrop for a slow and disappointing love story.  Needs to look at matrix trilogy for a lesson on how to do this.
B00C1BHQXK|1.0|Total crap. Don't buy this. A waste of good time. Do anything but read this book. Stinks, stinks, stinks, stinks.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I love this show but missed the entire first season. I was so glad when I was able to watch the entire thing for free with my Prime Membership. Typically, shows on FX can't be found online to be watched so this was a very pleasant surprise! Prime is worth it for this feature for sure!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. It was something different than the average hidden object, it had a variety of games within a game. I loved that I was not a timer and could play at my leisurely. I would buy more games like this if available.
B002W7J3SO|4.0|I'd watch any film starring Cary Grant, but aside from my appreciation for one of Hollywood's greatest of all time, I appreciate the action packed story of this film as well.<br /><br />Focused on a case of mistaken identity, this film reminds me somewhat of a Bourne movie - but with less violence.<br /><br />Go for it!
B001HBYHFA|5.0|&#34;It's Firefly&#34; - enough said. If you haven't seen the series and the movie then make sure you do. If you have seen them, you know what I mean.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|After a run a cheesy action flicks, this Tom Cruise film was surprisingly entertaining.  No unrealistic stunts, plenty of plausible action, good story.  Very nice Tom!<br /><br />I look forward to more Jack Reacher films!
B003G4W49C|4.0|How amazing it is to see how the future world could look from a 1980s perspective....  The book is a little long and provides a lot of information in the resolution of the story where the could have been another book.  I like it, I might read it again for fun in another few years, but even during the climax, the story still falls short of irresisitible...Read it, but I think the movie might be better.....
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I like it and I really like Google Chrome. The search bar comes up immediately and I do not have to guess where the icon is.
B006LSZECO|4.0|the end leaves a little to be desired...but she says she won't be writing a sequel so I guess it will stand as is.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I enjoyed the movie the very first time I watched it and will continue to do  so in the future.

B0051UP5NQ|2.0|I got this as OfficeSuite Pro 5 when it was offered free. Amazon does not show me as purchasing now but I did and it has been 'upgrading' since Nov 2011.<br />It no longer works, it force closes when doing most commands. Several others on the XDA KatKiss JB 4.3 forum have been complaining also that it crashes with the latest 'updates' and the developer is not helpful - just says 'try again with latest update'. IT IS THE LATEST update and it crashes .

B00A8MGLAI|4.0|So... how blooming good was Cloud Atlas eh!<br /><br />I mainly watched it because it was nearly three hours long and I was on a 24hr+ flight, but Cloud Atlas stood up as a lot more than a time filler. This is how sci-fi movies should be made! An epic romp through time with multiple stories interconnecting via reincarnation...<br /><br />...AND Halle Berry jiggling about. Mmmarvellous!<br /><br />Special mention has to go to Hugh Grant who for once isn't playing Hugh Grant (i.e. posh, foppish, bumbling Englishman). He actually makes for quite a passable bad-guy. Also, whilst we're on the subject of bad-guys; Hugo Weaving. He's good isn't he?! A really, really GOOD bad-guy! He has absolutely nailed the malevolent on-screen baddie. So much so that even as Elrond in LOTR (& despite knowing the story) I was still expecting the old double-cross.<br /><br />Anywho, I digress, back to Cloud Atlas, where was I? Cracking plot... excellent cast... ah yes, MAKE-UP. Now, I have to say, one of the most enjoyable things for me about CA was trying to recognise which actors were which character in each incarnation. The make-up & prosthetics team have produced an absolute masterclass; changing the cast's appearance/gender/race in each sub-story, and making them recognisable (if you try really hard) yet still believable. Two of the best (spoiler alert) - Hugh Grant as the Kone Chief and Hugo Weaving as Nurse Noakes.<br /><br />The fact that Cloud Atlas didn't get any Academy Award nominations was surprising, the fact that it didn't WIN Best Makup by a country mile was frankly criminal. I mean, Les Mis...? Really... ? I challenge anyone to watch the two movies and tell me that Les Mis did a better job.<br /><br />It might have had something to do with Cloud Atlas bombing at the box-office, the Academy Awards do seem to favour commercial success over artistic integrity these days.<br /><br />I have to say that if anyone was to blame for the box-office failure it would be the marketing team; I watched the trailers and adverts for Cloud Atlas, I'm a self confessed sci-fi fan (target audience!) and I still neither knew what the film was about nor had any great desire to go and watch it. But there lies the problem they had; how do you summarise the plot of a movie that is made up of so many interwoven stories, in a 3 minute trailer? Clearly, with great difficulty.<br /><br />Still, I could bemoan the lack of awards or commercial success that Cloud Atlas suffered all day long but I think that would be doing it a disservice. Cloud Atlas is one of the most enjoyable movies in the genre of recent times. It brings together a host of Hollywood's finest in an expertly interwoven plot, excellent cinematography and some sphincter clenchingly good action sequences!<br /><br />Highly recommended!team; I watched the trailers and adverts for Cloud Atlas, I'm a self confessed sci-fi fan (target audience!) and I still neither knew what the film was about nor had any great desire to go and watch it.

1936850028|5.0|As with a few other reviewers, I'm also not a skier, but \\"Beyond Birkie Fever\\" by Walter Rhein, drew me in from the very beginning and kept me turning the pages.  The descriptions of cross-country skiing and the skiers within the sport, is at once fascinating and easy to understand from any perspective.  If I had a complaint (and I don't), it would be the need for just a little more explanation about a few of the terms used, but because Rhein uses used such terms sparingly, they don't bog down the reader in any way.  I really enjoyed reading the humorous anecdotes and tales of effort both in and around the famed American Birkebeiner, or Birkie, and its participants.  It was fascinating to discover and be educated.
0321934962|5.0|I recently purchased a Nikon D7100 digital single lens reflex (DSLR) camera. This was a large step up for me because the last camera purchase I made was about 8 or 9 years ago. It also was a DSLR but well back in the earlier days of that technology. Realizing that I faced a steep learning curve, I looked around for some help. I must say that the manual provided by Nikon was a vast improvement over the one that came with my earlier DSLR. However, like most, if not all manuals of this type, it was fairly technical and stuck strictly to the features and controls of my new camera. Then it occurred to me that I had seen and ad for a book related to the Nikon D7100 DSLR. In fact, the book that I recalled was written by an author, John Batdorff, whose book on Nik Software[[ASIN:0321839773 Plug In with Nik: A Photographer's Guide to Creating Dynamic Images with Nik Software]] I had just reviewed. As I remembered, I was impressed with John's style of writing. Investigating further, I found that indeed he had published such a book and, from the limited glimpses of the content that are provided by publishers and book sellers, it seemed to be just the type of help I needed. So, I obtained the book.<br /><br />When I received it, I quickly scanned through it and began to wonder what I had received. Was this a book about the Nikon D7100 or was this a book on the practical side of photography written by a professional photographer? As I began to read it studiously, I was delighted to find that it was both. The author takes the reader on a journey through the practical side of photography (as opposed to the school approach of dogmatic photography) as seen through the lens of a Nikon D7100 DSLR.<br /><br />The book is a 275 page tome, soft covered and 7.5inches wide by 9 inches high. It is published by Peachpit Press and the recommended sale price is $24.99 ($16.38 at last look in Amazon). As stated previously it is written by John Batdorff, a professional photographer. The book israted at a level for Beginners or Intermediate users, a rating with which I would agree.<br /><br />So what is in this book that captured my attention? As I stated above, the author takes the reader on a journey through photography using the Nikon D7100 DSLR. From time to time, Batdorff will refer the reader to a section or specific page in the owner's manual to refresh material which might be to voluminous to repeat in his book. There are times when there was no mention of the Nikon camera for several pages. Here, simple, practical advice on photography prevailed. The book begins with several pictures of the D7100 with all of its external features identified in a simple, non-confusing fashion. Then, realizing that the first thing an owner of a new camera wants to do is to use the instrument on anything and everything, the author provides twelve tips to help the new user set up the camera and be more productive right out of the box. I must relate that, upon obtaining the camera, I read the owner's manual from cover to cover. However, there were several tips in this first chapter that caused me to go back and make some changes in my camera's setup. Next he covers the more mundane aspects of the camera such as, memory cards, updating firmware, cleaning the sensor, using RAW or JPEG, lenses, exposure and depth of field. While the average reader or a user of a camera of this caliber might feel that these are subjects previously well learned, time and again, Batdorff will hit on an item that causes the reader to react with, `Gee, I didn't know that.' And so it goes as he deftly weaves good photographic concepts into the proper use of the D7100. The chapters on the modes furnished on this camera are exceptional. The various modes are not only explained but practical use of them is detailed. Likewise with portrait and landscape photography. Without providing here a litany of the various chapter subjects, suffice it to say that all of the major aspects of photography are explored meshed with the best way to use the D7100's features in each of these areas.<br /><br />The illustrations in this book are plentiful and well done. Whether it is a picture taken by John to illustrate a photographic concept or a screen shot of a menu item on the camera, all are clear and well matched to the text accompanying them. All of the photos contain a legend which provides the ISO value, the shutter speed, the aperture value and the lens setting. The screen shots pointing out the proper camera setting are clear and very legible. Batdorff's writing style is low key but full of information. He does not try to impress the reader with a plethora of technical jargon. In short, he has provided a user manual that also teaches the user how to get the best photographs from the Nikon D7100 camera.<br /><br />As you can discern, I not only enjoyed learning about my new camera but in receiving a thorough grounding on using solid photographic concepts with the camera. I would offer an opinion that almost anyone with a desire to learn photography would benefit from this book irrespective of the camera they use. I realize that the translation of camera features might get somewhat laborious at times, but the photographic knowledge gained might be well worth the effort.

B0025KVLTC|5.0|Includes some of the Beatles' great transitional work.  This CD reissues the British version of the album; if you are updating/replacing a copy released in the US you also get to enjoy And Your Bird Can Sing and Doctor Roberts.
B001JIES4Q|5.0|I love the interaction between the characters and how the movie makes it feel like Lodon is this great small town. I just wish there was a part two to see what happened next for these great characters.
B006JRY0Q8|5.0|Hooked on this after finishing Season 1, initially as skeptical about the concept, but writing and acting won me over. Love the work Ron Perelman is doing with his role. Definitely worth the watch!

B00B7PIRIE|3.0|Since I don't get PBS, I bought this series to see what all the hub bub was about.  Basically, Downton Abbey is the next generation of night-time soap operas like Dallas or Dynasty, with better acting and fancier costumes.  And a million-dollar per episode budget.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne Collins had done very well on The Hunger Games and it was a great book and Catching Fire was a very great sequel in my opinion.  If you haven't read the first or second book yet READ it now.  Even the movies are good, but they changed so much in them.  Get this book now
B007SGM084|5.0|I had heard a lot of hype about this book.  It was better than I expected.  It gets better after the first book when they introduce some new characters and a mystery.  I really enjoyed it.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|cannot install fails everytime on the kindle fire not sure why is doens't allow me to install.<br />I cleared all of the programs and everything.
B0069GRIHW|3.0|Disc1  is great and very enjoyable as I remembered.<br /><br />Disc2 is junk and I will never play it again.<br /><br />I wish I had saved some money and purchased the Disc1 version only.  Unfortunately I looked at customer reviews which raved about the 2nd disc.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Five stars. To which I'd add, in response to Thomas A Marney's \\"what a disappointment\\" review, perhaps before labeling the film a travelogue one might read this quote directly from the product description: \\"Neither a traditional documentary nor a travelogue,\\"...
B00D02Z1EA|5.0|August Burns Red have been my favorite band ever since Constellations. I've listened to and loved all their albums, and I was really excited for this release. They don't disappoint. There's a lot of interesting twists and turns in this album, and a lot of unique traits it possesses. The main ones are the strange instruments and song structure. They incoporate so many different instruments that you don't hear in metalcore. They also have completely discarded traditional song structure. And, as usual, the musicianship and vocals are top notch. Brent and JB are probably the best guitarists in the genre, and they prove it here. The opening riff on Provision is enough to show that these guys mean business. Matt's drumming is amazing as always, and Dustin has a much bigger presence (both on bass and backing vocals) which really helps fill out their sound. Jake's vocals have officially reached sledgehammer status. He hammers and attacks your ears with otherworldly growls and shrieks all album long. These guys have been around a long time, and they prove why with this release. While not perfect, it comes pretty darn close. They've almost topped Constellations with this release, and I hope someday they will top it. Long live ABR!!
B0000CF35A|4.0|I purchased the vinyl 2003 release.  It sounds great.  The funny thing about Powerage, I think the first side is the best side AC/CD ever released, while the second side is mediocre.  Even so, this is a top notch AC/DC album with Bon Scott on vocals --- still better than any album with Brian Johnson.<br /><br />All the vinyl releases from 2003 are really a good buy.
B00DGKQ5I2|3.0|As my review title says, this album is way different than what I expected. I really expected a hard-hitting posthardcore album from these guys, and instead I got a rock album. There are good things about this album, such as the lyrics. These guys craft beautiful and poetic songs that speak directly to your heart. I've come to expect a high quality message from this band, and this album doesn't disappoint in that area. However, musically this album is very bland. There's really nothing that stands out as revolutionary or warranting of a second listen. It's a solid album, but rather boring. This band is capable of so much better. The heavy songs aren't nearly as powerful as the past, and the slow songs aren't as moving. Lyrically this is some of their best work, but the delivery just isn't up to par. There's a lot of radio rock material here, and not much inspiring and brutal masterpieces. The music writing is lacking in originality and memorability. Their past work has had some very fun and bouncy riffs that stick with you well after the song has ended. This album is completely void of that. They also seem to have lost the art of the breakdown. There just isn't any intensity there anymore.<br /><br />Conclusion: This album has some good songs, but there's a lot more soft songs and not much heavy material. I don't think they've \\"sold out\\", I just think they've decided they want more record sales and radio play. Their style now is much more mainstream oriented. This album is good if you want a nice rock album, but if you were expecting a posthardcore powerhouse like their last albums you will be very disappointed.
B008Y73940|4.0|Enjoyed Matthew McConaughey's character in this film.. Thought he put a fair amount of work into developing his character.<br />This film shows that he has more than one dimension to his acting abilities....
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is phenomenal, and I would absolutely recommend it to anybody and everybody. I cannot wait to read the remainder of the series.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|My expectations we low on this film....so when I watched it - I was surprised at what a good movie it really is.  If you are stickler to detail, you will appreciate this film.
B00A0NOF7G|1.0|I have literally read hundreds of mysteries - includig tons of cozys, chic lits and books not really worth reading. But I enjoy them and am not too critical...until this one. Absolutly nothing original, Zero character development, No plotting, nothing to recommend it even free! How I fell for paying $2.99 for this outline of a book is more than embarrassing. I got hooked by the &#34;frosting&#34;. The blurb was well done. Grannie with computers were the compelling idea, along with cupcakes. Unfortunately the &#34;mystery&#34; was skipped entirely (no suspects) and other than the grannies finding an article online, no use of that plot element. Incredibly sad that this person believed they were self-publishing an original story.
B000FC13UE|5.0|Wasn't sure what I was getting into and I was pleasantly surprised. Hadn't read much of his work except in anthologies and thought I'd give it a try. This was an enjoyable tale that kept me interested.

B009GXHOW4|5.0|This app is great for getting stuff like diamonds and bedrock. It helped me be able to change ur gamemode.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|I grew up watching Tom Cruise and have yet to see one of his movies that I don't like. This movie has a great storyline and plenty of action. I don't watch much television or many movies anymore because I've become very picky. If you like action this movie is worthy of your time.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|This was a great little device and for the price its a steal. I got these to bring so more bass to my Philips Uptown and man, they did the job. The only problem i had was not with the device itself but with the male to male 3.5mm cord that stopped working after 3 days of use. I didnt yank or anything and it just stopped working. But other than that problem the Fiio e6 was a great little investment.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is very simple, yet addictive and a lot of fun. I don't understand, really why I play. You slash the fruit with a sword. Apparently there is no end to the game and it is a bit of a stress reliever....
B00A7LNNR4|4.0|Other reviewers have covered the story in depth so I'll just add a bit about this particular edition.<br /><br />Oxford, as usual, includes a very good introduction, though they seem to assume everyone is familiar with the plot and so neglect to point out that it contains spoilers. If you're new to this one, please take heed.<br />Beyond that, the introduction provides some excellent insight into the story and its author. What I found particularly interesting was the little discourse on how the book transcended the \\"books for boys\\" archetype to become a bona fide classic.<br /><br />Some of the subject matter is a bit esoteric. Nautical terms and antiquated language abounds so it's nice to be able to consult the explanatory terms for reference. The flipping back and forth is a minor annoyance, though it's better to have the notes at the back than not at all.<br /><br />In general, the text is clear and readable, the binding is of a good quality and the book should stand up to many an enthusiastic read through without going to pieces.<br /><br />My only gripe, and one which is purely a matter of taste, is the cover. The cover looks like something you'd see on a children's book. In a title where the majority of characters meet grisly ends the cover seems rather out of place. I would have preferred a painted cover like those of the Penguin Classics line.<br /><br />Minor gripes aside, Oxford has done a good job with this edition and I recommend it equally to anyone looking to experience this title for the first time or the fiftieth.<br /><br />Fine reading!
0770437400|5.0|This book has an interesting narrative style that is not possible to be mimic by a movie. Cool, very cool.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Ok I am hooked, but I am stuck.  It's a fun when to pass th we time it's just hard to get the hang of, I am an older kid. Love the dash games and wanted to try something new. Great for young kids too!!!!
B007EDZ20O|5.0|I had no idea that mother Teresa was actually an evil witch. Who knew that someone pretending to be so holy is actually callous and arrogant. Another excellent argument against religion.
B009IU6N5Y|3.0|This movie was an interesting twist on factual history, not too corny, but not great either - killed some time
B00C1LIYWM|4.0|Would recommend this movie.......It is hard to follow at first, so you have to really stay focused...Good movie for family entertainment
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|I love using this in my classroom!  It makes my job much easier and integrates more technology into the classroom.
B00DB31Y3U|3.0|This is a hard game. I had a hard time knowing when I was over the landing place. Kept undershooting.
0399103422|5.0|Mario Puzo captures the hidden truth of the underworld by running parallel with real life mobsters. The Godfather has become a classic.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This game was fun to play! wish there were more levels. makes you think keeping the mind alert. the colors are vivid.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|so glad I found this game! besides some weird pauses, it works well and is a fun way to relax.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I have a school girl crush on Dave Grohl, which was the primary reason I decided to watch this. But in the end, it ranks up there with other recent music documentaries like It Might Get Loud and Pearl Jam Twenty. I enjoyed learning the history of this famed recording studio, but LOVED the last 30-45 minutes which featured Dave Grohl jamming and creating music with artists like Stevie Nicks and even Sir Paul McCartney. Very well done. Very engaging. If you're a music fan, you simply must watch this.
B006FPFTMS|3.0|Since I like the program on my PC, I figured it would be an easy transition. And it was, except...my big complaint is it didn't keep up with the changes and annotations on my Kindle Fire HD, which is the main reason I needed a program such as this. But as far as reading PDFs, it is pretty and works the same as it does on my computer.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is great. Clear graphics and easy play gives hours of endless amusement for both young and old. Download it now !
B00C061I3K|5.0|While not as fast paced or hit filled like Discovery, this album does not disappoint. There are a few songs that I'm not a big fan of but the amount of good ones out weigh the bad.
B000K2IFPK|5.0|Five stars for \\"A GIRL'S ADVENTURE\\" by CHLOE THURLOW<br />5 STARS- ONE HOT READ<br />PUSHES ALL THE EROTIC BUTTONS. The erotic genre is like a field of sunflowers packed to the horizon and it takes an exceptionally talented writer to stand head and shoulders above the swaying crowd. Chloe Thurlow is that writer. The author of five novels, essayist and blogger, I discovered in A Girl's Adventure a witty blend of pure de Sade debauchery and the literary qualities of Anaïs Nin.<br />This is the story of Greta May, an actress too submissive to elbow her way into leading roles which, deep down, she believes she merits, and the dominant Richard Marsham, who takes it upon himself to mold the girl until she is able to seize the main chance and bathe in the spotlight.<br />The novel is curious, controversial and touches all the erotic buttons. If you are seeking romance, á la Fifty Shades, A Girl's Adventure is not swaying in the same field. For fans of true erotica, one would be hard-pressed to find a better book.<br />Caution! When writing with passion-Your soul may catch fire-And leave smoldering embers-Throughout your story--Go on, set the world on fire! --~Author Cliff Roberts
B00CWVFPGO|3.0|keeps you entertained not great but  ok,  action is good a typical Arnold movie but not one of his better movies
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|SCARFACE THE ULTMATE GUIDE-5 STARS<br />Scarface the Ultimate Guide is just that, \\"The Ultimate\\". Author Damian Stevenson has solidified himself as one of the great film media mavens. Stevenson dissects the film and reconstructs it with a passionate eye which leaves no stone unturned in presenting the rich texture of the films behind the scene relationships and collaborations; as well as the on screen chemistry of the cast and crew.<br />Until now, no one has come close to examining this film in such detail. Stevenson takes you back to the great Howard Hawks film starring George Raft and Paul Muni, of the same name, Scarface, which is based loosely on the notorious gangster Al Capone and explains the intertwining of the two films. He delves into the perceived factors behind the remake's initial lack of public acceptance and critical acclaim; to its becoming the template by which all other films in the genre' are judged.<br />Stevenson explores every aspect of the film, yet does so in a way that is entertaining and not at all starched and stuffy, as most in depth dissections of film tend to be. But just because it's entertaining doesn't mean he's given this subject the tabloid gossip column treatment either. This is a definitive guide and is bound to become a must read of every serious film student.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book and recommend it whole heartedly to every film buff and serious student. I believe this quote best sums up Damian Stevenson's skills as a writer.<br />\\"The true measure of an author's talent is gauged by the passion with which he has written.\\"<br />~Author Cliff Roberts
B008AIGWVA|2.0|i downloaded this app before i realized that it won't work on my kindle. it does sound cute but i cant really give it my opinion as it didn t work for me
B005JTAP4S|5.0|This story is captivating. As a grandparent with younger grandchildren, I will be reading this one to them over and over for a very long time. William O'Brien has crafted a marvelous story filled with likeable yet scary characters that pursue and harass young Peter as he journey's through a magical land based on his imagination.<br />This is a story that is truly enchanting but with a subtle dark edge to it, which is reminiscent of the Brothers Grim or Tolkien. William O'Brien's style of writing is descriptive yet smooth and fast moving. He provides the reader with an experience they will not soon forget. This is a terrific read for the younger reader and a great grandparent read along with the kid's book.<br />I can see \\"Peter. A Darkened Fairy Tale\\" captivating young readers for generations to come.<br />\\"When you write a story you get to create everything. You are God, but please be a benevolent God.\\"~ Author Cliff Roberts
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I recommend this game for everybody. It's fun and addicting and I think everyone will enjoy playing, it's also very time consuming.
B005HS00NW|5.0|IF Roxy Music had a jam session with Trans Siberian Orchestra, this might be the love child sired as a result. I love this CD! It's fresh yet retro at the same time and completely clever and aurally satisfying!

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|The book was great! A little bit sad though that you could understand that Gus was gonna die before you actually read it. Also what happens to Hazel??<br /><br />Ahhh...  great book! I really enjoyed reading this one
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Greattttt!!!!<br />This app is fun and interesting..it definitely keeps u busy when you're bored !!! Get it.NOW...YOU WONT REGRET IT
B008602KQI|4.0|The book is so much better than movie, but the movie is still good...adds a picture for what you've been reading.  I read the book first, but im pretty sure if I hadn't there would have been ALOT about the movie that I wouldn't have understood.  So bottom line is READ THE BOOK, itll add a lot to the movie:)
B003C5FMEE|4.0|My experiences with TS are all from live performances. The studio recordings while good are not as exciting; folk who have never seen him live love the cd.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|Love the game but it takes forever to be able to get more staff. Like how challenging the game is but you need money to do well. So i like it and dislike it.
B005CAAVVQ|4.0|Not as good as seeing him live but a good recording that is worth adding to your collection. He is truly a great musician
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Remarkable writing and great use of the English language.  For those of us over 50, this was a great reliving of the late 50's/early 60's!

B0064X7FVE|1.0|Hate the new version.  It's hard to navigate and there are too many ads.  I may delete and go with another app.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My daughter and I watch this show together.  I don't have to worry about anything inappropriate and its good tv.  Awesome.
0061997811|5.0|I learned a lot of things about the movies. I really enjoyed this book. One thing though, do not remove anything that is attached to the book. You will spoil it. You can look at them though. You can look at them, but make sure to replace them, otherwise you could lose them. Well worth the money. If you are a Harry Potter fan you will really enjoy it. Everything you wanted to learn about how they made the movies, it is in this book. How they found the young people to play Harry, Ron and Hermione. How they stayed friends. Read and enjoy. I fully recommend it. How they found the other players also.
B00821OX98|5.0|I was hooked after the first episode.  Everyone wonders what would happen if aliens invaded. The characters are great and the story line is full of so many twists and turns that you will not be satisfied with just watching 1.
B000VDUWMC|4.0|In some places it is a bit repetitive, and it is fairly dense and academic.  On the other hand, it covers a very interesting subject matter in a detailed and persuasive way.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|great great movie good times for all except JFK of course. THE EVENT That changed the course of American history in recent history. Great movie
0316286850|5.0|even if you're not an aspiring makeup artist this book is a great read for the average makeup enthusiast. You'll learn to master makeup basics like a pro.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The twists in this story are what made it so intriguing. An especially unforgettable ending. Looking forward to reading more from this author.
B00CRMWMZ0|2.0|Was hoping daft punk would go back to their old style - but no. Just Jamie foxx and a bunch of slow autotuned tracks. Not impressed.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Couldn't be more satisfied with this boxed set. The case is like a book when it opens and you flip through from one bluray to the next like pages of a book and there are open pages with information on them in between each film. Not to mention the two exta content discs!
B002HWRYJE|4.0|Star Trek is a great movie, and I would recommend it to any person who likes science fiction, action, thrillers, or even dramas, Star Trek fan or otherwise. It's a great envisioning of the series and I like how well cast the movie is. My only problem with this product is that it took forever to get to me. I don't think this is a common problem with the product, but, I'm not entirely sure. I still like the movie and was willing to forgive a little lateness.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|My original review is below, the game worked nicely, I paid $9.99 for the full version and than had it jam and remove itself from my device. YET it let a huge chunk of content in my \\"other\\" section so I can remove it. It now downloaded the free version again and wants me to pay for the full version AGAIN. Plus all my progress is lost.  So frustrating.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW;<br />I dont know about the reviews below but it works fine on my Kindle Fire (took FOREVER to download).  I have played Magic cards a few dozen times before this.  The game set up is fun, a lot of really nice art and story fluff.  The free version gives you a feel for what it has to offer, if you like it then you would have to pay the $9.99 because the free version only lets you play 5 opponents in the single campaign (which uses an all Green deck). In the blind pack you can make any kind of deck you want from the packs but only have one opponent to play. There is also a tutorial that give you 3 very basic opponents to teach you against.<br /><br />There is definitely enough for a couple hours of fun and to figure out if you like it enough to pay for the full version.
B00CPTUN5G|3.0|My daught watches the TV show on netflix daily, on a loop almost 24/7. i do enjoy the fact out of every show she watches, this one teaches life lessons that could emotionally strenghten her, if pinky pie wasn't so destracting. this movie was a birthday present that she's watched once, and gone back to the TV show. I was a new concept that i really don't think was a big hit. I think this could have been a pilot for a spin off that just didn't quite make the grade (Battle Star Galatica was a movie that piloted for the TV show) The alternate universe theory was odd, and distracting, the whole thing kinda reminded me of the 2nd Highlander movie, it was completely different than all the others and it's looked at as a huge mistake. I agree it was more for merchandising than anything else, but Hasbro owns MLP so that kinda expected. I'd get the DVD it's cheeper, it's good for a MLP Fix while waiting for season 4. just be thankfull you won't need to watch it a bazillion times.
B001P4ESGC|5.0|I loved this season.  So many turns and twists.  When I thought I had figured it out, then Patti Hewes turned the whole thing upside down!
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I mean like I search my title and it takes for ever to load but I'm like who cares then I click my video it starts YES Then like five seconds later it has to load NO  I never get yo see three seconds with out it stopping I say no just go to web and search youtube

B00992CF6W|4.0|I mean it's minecraft minecraft s awesome but I have the computer version so<br />But when I do play it I get bored but when you first get it it's awesome but then I never play it now
B007DIQC90|4.0|I really enjoy listening to this CD as it is very different musicality and vocals. Monsters and Men are in a class by themselves. and I look forward to new music by them.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I'd give it 3 it's super fun never gets old but<br />To just get to play it's hard I needed my mom<br />You need a password to play to start new account<br />So I'd give it 3 stars
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|This game is very well made like the other games. I also perfere, nova2, nova3 and gangster rio. I love gameloft.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|with all the usual surprises you never see coming, another page turner that u wont put  down. Connelly never dissapoints!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game for all ages!  the only complaint i have is the load time. sometimes i have to close the app and reload. that gets tiresome.
B008NA2JMQ|5.0|Quite amazing to read what actually happened behind the scene<br />Parts are quite hilarious which made it even better<br />Highly recommend this book
B009DCOU9S|5.0|A not too challenging find things puzzle game with a nice little timed hint system if you get stuck.  I am almost done and looking forward to solving the mystery of who is causing all this trouble in the tower.
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|I rented this before buying it (thank God. It seemed so rushed from story to story and nothing was in chronological order and stories were hard to follow. The only thing I got from this movie is that the author strongly believed in reincarnation. I actually emailed redbox and ask for 3 hrs of my life back. They of course could not do that but they did comp me a free movie.
B00ARA4SLU|3.0|Sir Anthony Hopkins portrays Hitchcock's mannerisms of sophisticated eccentricity in a believable manner, creating a likable character I am happy to follow along with through his struggles. The main conflict in the film starts immediately, Hitchcock trying to relive the artistic freedom from his early days before the stifling bureaucracy of the studio became suffocating. Hitchcock wants to create the provocative film \\"Psycho\\", which really symbolizes his need for freedom and refreshment in that stage of his life and career. I enjoyed how slowly other conflicts began to weave themselves into the main plot, such as Hitchcock's relationship with his wife and infatuation with his blondes. Hitchcock feels betrayed by Vera Miles as she passed him up on a movie offer, choosing family over stardom. The scene where Vera throws up her hands as she is ignored by Hitch shows his feelings of hurt and betrayal about her. Hitchcock's fascination now becomes focused on Janet Leigh. This focus intertwines with the growing conflict in his relationship with his wife, as seen by her insecure expressions while at dinner as Hitchcock glows over Janet. His wife's insecurity becomes amplified and she seeks emotional comfort elsewhere. In the end, Hitchcock and Alma's wife relationship prevails, and their team work is what completes the film and allows it to become the iconic movie it has become. I was pleasantly surprised by the captivating nature all of these little sub conflicts represented and their interdependence in the grander architecture of the plot. I enjoyed the film and recommend it to anyone who enjoys wants to take a glimpse into the artistic character of Hitchcock.
0307276902|5.0|Much was made of this book upon the discovery that his journey was not a real one.  Real or not, if you have ever known anyone who has taken drugs and alcohol to excess, or if you have done so yourself...let me assure you that this is as real as it gets.  It is wonderfully written as well and will keep you at the edge of your seat with all stories of lives on the brink of the abyss of drug death.  This work should not be at all discounted for any reason...it is tops!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's a good book and you can really feel Greg's emotions even if it's just a regular middle school book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is perfectly cast, the writing is great, and the imagery is enjoyable. The insight to WWI era England is an added plus.
B005544TRQ|5.0|If you like lawyer shows to be intense, fast moving and filled with witty sarcasm, this is the show for you.
B00634GHJA|4.0|Works great. Downloaded work pics from my DROID to computer in a snap. Connected quick and files transfered quick. No problems
B00821PCJS|5.0|Exciting yet still family friendly.  Intriguing storyline.  Developing characters.  Gripping action.  And all this without foul language, overt sexuality, or gory bloody violence.  Well done.
B003O86FMW|4.0|If I liked the plot I would give it a 5.  Still repulsed with the premise of story plot, I have now gone back to finish the first book as well.  Character development is very good and I do feel compelled to read the third book.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Can't wait for the next book to come out. Another well written story that literally takes up right where the first one left off. Much better than this review.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I'm not an avid reader, so if a book does not catch me in the very beginning it usually doesn't get finished...Could NOT put the book down!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|this is a comedic action movie, the main characters are entertaining and the dialogue witty...a kick back, eat some popcorn, get-away movie.
B007V4530A|4.0|Extracts and explains some noteworthy techniques from successful Ted presenters. Convenient read with certainly good takeaways of which some might be well known.
B009GJBEF6|4.0|I really enjoy the movie.  I've stopped counting the number of times I've seen it.  It's like a favorite book you can read again and again.  Having direct knowledge of its filming and production does bias me a bit.  Still.. it's a SOLID Bond movie for any collection.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I absolutely love this book and am working on the second.  I read other reviews only after I read City of Bones and I was truly disappointed with the negative reviews. I almost feel the reviewers don't like the writer.  Yes there will be similarities when it's a bunch of teenagers and the supernatural world.<br />I love her style of writing no extra fluff the story is ALWAYS moving there is no drag time and just enough detail.  The only problem I have is I read to put myself to sleep and these books suck at putting me to sleep.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|From the technical perspective, it is outstanding.  The merger of CGI with digital green screen and motion capture is superb!<br /><br />I wish the movie were longer but perhaps that's the signature of a great movie; it leaves you wanting more.<br />It's well structured, although a bit shallow and muddlesome in places.  I still would not detract from it.<br /><br />I cannot speak to how well it adheres to the comic storyline.  I hope someone will.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|This is a good product.  It is kind of weird to try and take a picture with the Kindle HD 7 facing you but it works.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|I've listened 3 or 4 times now and I'm really enjoying this album. Of course those who love great musicianship in a rock setting will find a lot to like here. I did not know Kotzen could sing like this! To me he sounds like Chris Cornell from Temple of the Dog; just a very cool rock voice! Great musicians making music together and a whole lot of fun!
B00CUIVGZS|5.0|Seems pretty obvious to me that the (otherwise distracting) cover art is an homage to Don Quixote. And as Chick is an aging musician... the artwork seems apropos. Would love to hear the story behind the cover art.
B005HSL626|4.0|Want an easy way to pass a few minutes of commute time?  Try Fruit Ninja to get rid of some pent up anger and to hear a lot of squishing sounds.
B005P3NPXG|5.0|SAW HIS CONCERT AND HAD TO BUY THIS ALBUM.  FULL OF HOT R & B SOUNDS.  DELIVERED PROMPTLY AND IN GREAT CONDITION.
B005LAII1C|4.0|Seth McFarlen really knows his stuff this movie has a good story and a ton of funny moments that will make you laugh from the first moment you pop it it in to the final credits
B000JK8OYU|5.0|GREAT CONDITION AND SHIPPED WELL.  THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEATLES BEST ALBUMS MASTERED REALLY WELL SO THE SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT. WITH ALL THE OLD SONGS
B009MF56GC|2.0|the first one was very good but this one was very cheesy I was really disappointed with the sequel too many one liners very cheesy .
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|I love this game because it is awesome, you can do lots of things.  The graphics are really very good.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|So far everything about the Pulse has met expectation.  Obviously, the pedometer function works excellent, but the most surprising is the sleep mode.  Tracking my sleep was something I didn't really focus on, but now it's automatic.
B007JMW46U|5.0|Besides the classics what I  love  are illustrations and what is more the perfekt English.This helps  to wellcome the electronic book.
B0054SMID0|4.0|Action packed movie with twists and turns.  Endearing street wise characters who are pitted against evil and the privileges of the very wealthy.
B001TWPC56|5.0|I strongly recommend this seller and vinyl.<br />The status of vinyl is exactly same to what this seller said.<br />Needless to say, this album is best.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I first saw Wicked in New York in 2009 & at that moment fell in love! The twist on the classic Wizard of Oz really changed my view of the movie itself! There are no other artists that could have played the roles of Elphaba (Idina Menzel) and Glenda (Kristin Chenoweth) quite as we'll as these two women. Their powerhouse voices really lend themselves to the power of the roles & make e musical & the cd a true success!!
B005DZ35RC|5.0|I love the original movie and this modern version is awesome too. Johnny Depp as Willie Wonka is brilliant! Very entertaining.
B00E8S2JZ4|2.0|..., includes the two deleted verses of that horrible song, making it even longer and more unbearable to hear every time you watch it.  Lucky us.  Can't wait to purchase this!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I am on level 12 now and haven't had any technical problems. I do skip the dialogue a little slow paced for me. I do enjoy the game
B00D3XAA4M|1.0|Nothing better than a leaflet. The sketchy details are of no use, nor attractive. The description are more like advertisement than information
B004TLDZ3U|4.0|what a great band! so much talent and painstaking work goes into each song,<br />each album. the listener never doubts the band<br />made sure every turn/ movement in the songs is there because<br />it needed to be there; because it passed<br />the test of their high standards.<br /><br />not much left to say. you love them or you dont.<br />I LOVE OPETH. i really love damnation and heritage by them too,<br />theyre all great albums.
B0050NJMKG|5.0|Simple and well written. Fantastic account of how a single man's mission to own a piece of Africa led to such destruction. This book added to my knowledge of Africa and especially the Congo. As described in the book, local knowledge of this atrosity is not well known. I am glad to add this book to my collection on Africa.
B008602KQI|5.0|It grabbed me from the start! I was entertained all way through.  Furthermore, when I finished reading the Hunger Games, I could not wait to star reading the sequel book.
B005PK57IK|5.0|The show picks up where it left off and always kept the audience involved. The plot gets thicker and the characters have to delve into deeper feelings, which is great to watch.
B003TH14H4|4.0|This season more interesting than the first one .  Circumstances mostly believable and the characters fit well in their roles.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game is very interesting and a great time passer! You have to download to Kindle!!! The game isn't too easy or too hard
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Luv this game. Been addicted to it since I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire. A must have for game enthusiasts.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I was surprised how good this game is. It has so much to it, I thought it was going to be a simple running game. But it's really so much fun!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|By the time I got to this book I was getting a bit tired of this book. The sex scene were still erotic but getting redundant. Glad to see they caught Jack, should have killed his character!! It was fun reading at the end Christian's version of their first meeting. Liked the book(s) and have learned a few things to give a try!
B004UID2LC|5.0|wicked awesome HD and easy to use and great for kindle it was difficult for me to use you tube with my kindle
B0041D843M|5.0|Capitalism is a destructive as well as creative force. Consolidated wealth can propagate the underlying business models it relies upon through advertising, government policy, industry. For those wishing to understand how to eat for health,  and why in the western world we eat what we eat this is an illuminating read.
B0002ZFYAY|5.0|The sound and picture quality was exceptional. The musical score was excellent too. Very scary picture. It was as frightening as it was when I first saw it. It would be a great movie to show on Halloween.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|!!SPOILERS!!<br /><br />A fine book overall, I just found one flaw in the plot that bothered me.  The first part of the book spends a lot of time building up Vaelin as a just, principled man that will not kill unless in self defense.  Every action he takes builds up this perception of Vaelin.  So I was a little bit stunned when Vaelin agrees to a plot with the king (who he only met 10 minutes ago) to murder a noble (he's never met before) in order save the life of the wife (he's never met before) of a man he killed in the arena.  It seems a flaw that one so principled like Vaelin would agree to be a murderer and in doing so, make himself the slave of a king he knows nothing about just to save a woman that he knows even less about.  Other than this, it was a fine book.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Great way to pass time. Fast paced. Love to compete with my facebook friends and beat them so they know who is best!
B000THGR0Q|5.0|I'm going to be as brief as possible.<br /><br />In my sincerely humble opinion, this is quite possibly the greatest album ever recorded - by Tull or any other \\"rock\\" band.<br /><br />Sure, there are many more influential albums... important albums.... But in terms of production, arrangement, album art, song selection, ... everything... The total cohesion of Songs from the Wood is unmatched.<br /><br />It's perfect. Songs from the Wood is a perfect album.<br /><br />People may not like the music (hey, tastes differ), but it is inarguably a masterwork of writing, playing, singing, and vision.<br /><br />Songs from the Wood... greatest record ever released.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I laughed. Often. Mission accomplished.<br /><br />It was fun to see Babs hook up with Martel from The Replacements. In Lubbock. Although to be fair, that restaurant is actually in Amarillo, and 80 oz. steak aside, the food's pretty good there. Just don't sit too close to the stage when someone's getting near the end. Nobody wants to see someone toss their cookies while you're trying to eat your dinner.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|I love this movie. Bought it so I could share it with my boyfriend. He loved it too! It's a great family movie as well.
B005HSL626|4.0|My grandchildren liked this app. Seems like having flying fruit pieces all over the place is fun for kids. I liked it because it was a free download.
B008JFUR10|4.0|After seeing many one-star reviews that don't even mention the film I thought I'd throw in my own review that actually analyses the movie so that you fully understand what you're getting into. I'll be covering:  Story(Spoiler free)  Sound  Visuals  Characters  Popular Criticisms(That aren't spoilers)  ===  So in a fictional very-near future. A portal known later as \\"The Breach\\" opens up in the deep Pacific Ocean trenches. Kaiju(Japanese for giant monster) start coming through The Breach and begin destroying things. It takes several days to take down the first one using conventional weaponry(jets, tanks, ballistic missiles) so they decide to initiate the Jaeger program. Which created giant mechs that bring the fight with the Kaiju to an equal playing field. The story from there is an on-par story that won't make you think hard but it also won't make you feel stupid(Maybe just a little) either. It doesn't bring up any stupid questions about philosophy. The story shows what humanity can do when it puts the bs behind it and works together.  ===  The sound is loud and jarring. A bit distracting at times but it fits with the fact that you have skyscrapper sized robots and monsters fighting. It's all very immersive and none of it uses stock sound effects. Also the soundtrack is great. If you need to understand the feeling of the movie just listen to the theme song on Youtube as that sets the mood for the ENTIRE MOVIE.  ===  This is the best looking movie I've ever seen. Especially since it balances practical effects and CGI. The inside of the Jaeger and all the cables hooked up to the pilots are real tangible objects(Minus the spinning death blade inside Gipsy Danger). And the monster were designed with anatomical accuracy so that if these Kaiju were real they wouldn't be too far off from what you see in this movie. There is also so much attention to small details. Such as when a Kaiju named Knifehead stabs a Jaeger. It's blade has it's own blood on it from being cut up bythe tearing metal. That's attention to detail you won't find in other summer action films. And I love it.  ===  Characters in this film are deliberate cardboard cut-outs except for Idri Elba's character Stacker. This is all in homage to the b-list monster movies that many grew up with so I think they get a free pass(For the most part). Except when the one Australian character said \\"I'll drop you like a sack of Kaiju s***.\\" Get it? Because the only thing worse than a sack of excrement is one belonging to what could end humanity? Yeah it's cringe worthy and dialogue like this influenced me making my review four stars instead of five.  ===  A VERY popular criticism of the movie is \\"Why didn't they use the sword sooner?\\" Well that's actual answered in the beginning when it shows Knifehead tear the plasma cannon off a Jaeger because it was already hit by it once. You see, the Kaiju are living beings so they will learn as they fight(Later on a Kaiju actually disables on of the blades because of this fact). They show early on that you can't be a one trick pony while fighting. I'm not sure how people forget this.    \\"Why didn't they curb stomp that one Kaiju that they double-tapped?\\" For the same reason this is only four stars and not five.  ===  Should you see this film? Not if you're a philosophical scholar who thinks all films have to be deep, complex, and thought-provoking to be worth your time. If you're looking for the best monster movie of all time. Then yes.
1401937519|3.0|Was recommended this book by a friend and after reading various other books on same, was a little disappointed that Anita did not expand on what it was really like on the other side, the beauty, family/friends, what is expected of us, etc.  Otherwise, I thought the story of her sickness and how it just left her wasted to nothing and how she came back to full health was tremendous and inspiring as to the control you truly have on your mind, body, etc.  Enjoyable but left me wanting more info on other side.
B00A32CKKI|5.0|Reminds me of my Grand Parents who were Italian Share Croppers and were treated a lot like those in the movie!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|i am able to play the game without alot of interruptions and advertisements that tend to pop up when you get a free game or book.  i'm always looking for free products without alot of catches
6303011012|3.0|I owned this VHS before one of my friends or relatives decided to borrow (?) it.  This particular VHS I found to be grainy and hard to see, which makes me question if I purchased a copy of the original.  The quality of the film detracted from my enjoyment of the concert and made me regret re-purchasing it. Such a shame because this was one of Yanni's best live concerts.
B0058VW36U|4.0|This game is great for children of all ages if only there was a free version...... but is fun and entertaining for long trips
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was well-thought out, no detail left to chance, and full of twists and turns that you don't see coming.  I enjoyed the story a great deal, even if the characters in the book weren't terribly likeable.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|It is no accident that Downton Abbey has received 12 Emmy nominations.  The script, art direction, and the actors at all levels are outstanding.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this app so much so addicting.I play it so much...great app.. best stop every in fact even my baby brother plays it
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Dragonvale gets addictive. Once I had a lot of stuff on my islands it took up a lot of space. It took up 810mb of space.  Then I had to delete the app.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Hi!!! I bought this app recently thinking hey, it looks kinda fun... only I was wrong.... ITS PRETTY AWESOME!! For anyone that like the apps temple run or subway surfers! &lt;3
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My son loves this game. Very good for the hand and eye coordination. Very good for the reflex andresponce. A little confusing on the tablet as y how to move the character around. We figured out in the end. It took aboutseven times playing then he figgured it out. He loves it.
0066620996|4.0|I never received Good to Great quick summary.  It is a Kindle book.  I was charged though.  I thought I'd get it that day.  What's up???<br /><br />Marty
B000E41MRC|5.0|FANTASTICALLY GREAT ! historical experience which lets new generations understand WHY it was so difficult to defeat Germany in WWII.  This is a 2005 digitally re-mastered transfer from 35mm film originally (very creatively) made in 1934.  The Nazi propaganda is Thick.  Excellent Commentary by Dr. Anthony Santoro brings perspective through appropriately interspersed re-telling of post war facts from the Nuremberg Trials of 1946.  You, as a viewer, will tend to think that nothing is wrong with the Nazi Party platform. . . unless you are truly informed about the FACTS of World War II.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|Wonderful book!! I was sad when it was over. He is an amazing author. It feels like you are right there.
0399226907|2.0|The book was really small when it arrived. Not what I expected at all. It's still nice, but still small.
B002BVYBBK|5.0|Loved the cars especially the Charger and Vin Diesel and Paul Walker - hot!<br /><br />My husband and I saw this at the theater when it first came out in 2001 and loved it then. We just watched it again and enjoyed it again. Believable - not totally. But it's still a fun movie with great stunts and fast paced action.<br /><br />I bought the [[ASIN:B00BFZBMDS Fast & Furious: 1-5 Bundle [Blu-ray + Digital Copy + UltraViolet]]] so hubby and I will be watching the next four in the series soon.
B001HN6922|5.0|great movie for kids and adults. Had a lot of fun watching it. Recommend to any age group of kids
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Worth buying. Wish the sealed decks gave a little more. Other than that I have  no issues. Buy now buy buy buy
0765325950|5.0|Sanderson does a good job of wrapping up a decades long story started by Jordan. The entire book feels like a never ending battle, but thats what I imagined the Last Battle would be like. The ending was fitting and I was satisfied. Recommend to any Wheel of Time fans who have not read it yet.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Love the weather channel ap, but I don't like the new upgrade. This one isn't as easy to navigate as the old one and I don't like the home page either.
B00CEQ1JOO|4.0|My daughter collects all MH dolls. We purchase all the new ones, and go on doll missions, trying to find them at stores before we have to pay a bit more online. I found this at my local FredMeyer for 10 dollars on sale, LUCKY ME! She is gorgeous! She put it in her favorite MH shelf, along with CUPID, CATRINE DEMEOW, and JIN FIRE LONG. Stunning details on this one, I love when they include the diaries and the little animals, also comes with a purse and a stand for the doll. Very happy with this purchase. Keep the new characters coming MATTELL! We dont like having to repurchase the same doll in a different outfit or look, so new characters are welcome :)
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|Great retelling of the story. Im a big horror fan and i love gory stuff. Needless to say that i got my fill... =) It left you wondering who would die next! Thats a good horror movie for me.
B00CFA225Y|5.0|My 6 year old love it and we have enjoyed several viewings already.  We got it the same day that it came out by doing the preorder and I was so impressed that we did not have to wait or leave the house!
0064471837|5.0|An original dark fantasy novel that has held its own throughout the years, I enjoy 'Sabriel' as much now as I did ten years ago. 'Sabriel' follows the story of a schoolgirl who has grown up with the power of a necromancer - but instead of using it to raise the dead, she has been trained as the next Abhorsen whose task is to lay the dead back to rest. When her father, the current Abhorsen, is trapped by an old enemy, Sabriel must leave behind the comfortable life of a schoolgirl in a land without magic and venture into the Old Kingdom, a perilous place of magic, enigmatic spirits and the dead who will not rest. Definitely worth a read, a re-read, and more re-reads, 'Sabriel' keeps a treasured place on my bookshelf along with its follow-on novels, 'Lirael' and 'Abhorsen'. Highly recommended and a must-read novel!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is described as Young Adult Fiction, but I felt it could appeal to any reader, old or young. The storty is beautifully written, and as you fall in love with the 16 year old characters, it breaks your heart to come to know them and the beauty of the love they share with each other, and with their families. They have a lot to teach us all about what it is like to persevere through the hardships of cancer, and still find joy. I highly recommend this novel!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|So interesting.  I truly enjoyed hearing of Dr. Alexander's. journey.  Thanks for explaining your trip.  What an experience.  I would recommend his book to everyone.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|my husband likes the larger size and grips on this controller, however they don't have a very long life, so this price was far better than from the manufacturer.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|its so cool so I like it because its cool and I like it. and sometimes it act dumb lolzz
B001R60ESE|5.0|This is one of the best Blu-ray concerts in my collection. The song selection, guest singers, music and sound quality are simply outstanding. It is tough to pick a best performance, but the duet with Chris and Lucia stole my heart. The duet with Chris and Yo-Yo Ma make the Blu-ray worth buying if only to capture this special moment of these two modern day marvels in your personal library. I could have listened to them play for hours.<br /><br />I listened to the concert in Dolby True HD with a 5.1 setup, and the sound was AMAZING! First rate audiophile-grade production and entertainment. If you are even thinking of buying this Blu-ray, just do it. You will be so glad you did. 5/5 stars.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Change the way that I view creativity and motivated me to make some long overdue changes.  Thanks Austin! Look forward to reading your blog.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Very funny never know what is next<br />Great sound effects We watch it with sub titles here in U s a
B004SCRDCY|5.0|Hands down one of the best crime/mob stories. An absolute CLASSIC and if you don't own it or just assume you've seen the movies and that's enough, you are sadly mistaken.<br /><br />Easily one of the best novels I've ever had the pleasure of reading time and time again; and take my word for it. You will have no regrets once you dig into this masterpiece.
B006M4F67A|4.0|As a Mahjong fan I enjoy this version. As opposed to others this one is not boring, nor limited.It's a good buy. Thanks for making it available!
0345803507|5.0|This was the culmination of all three books and it did not disappoint. Love that the writer gives glimpses of what happened from Christian's end from the moment they met, giving the man's perspective and his feeling very rare.
B005KDDUVS|5.0|He leido muchos libros... Pero este ejemplar se ha siyuado en mi alma.<br />Leerlo te lleva por vidas, por calles, por aventuras...
1439156816|5.0|Excellent read even if you aren't a writer. If you are a writer, or author, you will benefit from his advice.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't stop reading it!...so a read non stop for two days and I loved it!...I'm sure that if you've read the las two book you undertand what i'm saying. E.L James...you are a geniuos!...Can't wait for the movie (or the forth book hope to god for that one!)<br />110% recomendable. Read it!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Campy but fun. Its sad this got cancelled so quickly. I watched every one and the movie and was left wanting more.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Don't really care for the new format. Doesn't seem as user friendly. I just want to<br />know local up to national weather without being bothered with awards or points .
291193976X|4.0|Stephane Hessel gives an historical perspective on current World political conditions which make all of us indignant.  His taking a stand on these events has been writing and negotiating laws and/or treaties.  Changes have been at glacial rates; but we can all contribute by living and advocating less fraud and brutality.  I readily followed his examples and reasoning although I relied on the English translation with its unusual sentence structure.  French readers gave the book 5 Stars.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|too much damn singing...&#34;lalala this...lalala that&#34;. My gf liked it, and I used the sounds to fall asleep. Hard to watch X men again after seeing Wolverine sing...
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|This one was entertaining, it just didn't quite live up to what I've come to expect from the Die Hard series, so was a little disappointed with that - but all in all, it was fun to watch.
B002AS463W|5.0|I had seen this film ages ago and loved it and wanted to have a copy but unfortunately the quality poor
B002W1UEW4|4.0|I liked this movie! Good old good vs. evil, good wins!!  Never get tired of the good guys wining :D
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a simple game that works well and doesn't cause problems. It's provided lots of enjoyment. The ads are quick at the beginning of the game and easy to dismiss.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love these type of games and would definitely push this. It's inexpensive and an easy way to pass the time, like reading a book or something in that nature.
B0095P33IW|4.0|Saw this movie as predicate for &#34;Avengers&#34;.  Upon seeing Avengers, found Cap America the only hero among all other characters.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This was a great story that shows the power of love and forgiveness.  I fell in love with Victoria's character and consequently her story as well.  It's a beautiful story about the true meaning of family.
B007R6UWN0|5.0|Only complaint is not enough more recent episodes!!! CAN YOU FIND MORE OF THIS? Great writer, fantastic actors, terrific story line. Give me more and soon!
B006O5YHUY|5.0|And not only the best mma movie to date, but one of the best fighting movies since Rocky.  A masterpiece.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Very interesting series. Would not have thought twice about watching it but a friend kept raving about it until I gave in.
B002S45V32|5.0|Considered a classic of the 80's...one of John Hughes most memorable films! Have this in DVD format & book definitely a watch.
B00D3J2QKW|1.0|Don't buy this book, you will be just too annoyed about how this guy has made money out of you.
B0014BY72Q|5.0|The movie trailer offered on amazon does this movie no justice!  After watching the movie in full and falling in love with the futuristic model city that was used for the visual effects, I gained such a respect for well made science fiction movies of this time.  You can throw away computerized special effects because this movie did not disappoint and frankly speaking old school effects did a better job of keeping me glued to my seat!  Aside from the visuals the story in this movie is what really gets to you.  Here you have in essence the perfect society.  However in order to maintain population control this society demands that all persons who have turned the age of 30 surrender themselves for termination.  This is where you kind of agree with this type of mentality.  However you are soon introduced to the other sentiment of those who wish to live past the age of 30 and who will try to beat the mandate that limits their life.  I really enjoyed the science fiction trip that this movie took me on and to enjoy the conclusion of the movie.  I definitely suggest giving this movie a try as it won't disappoint you.  I want to see this movie again!
B00821PCJS|4.0|I am very much enjoying this series! It is a series that I plan to follow as long as it plays.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Coolest app most inexpensive way to own a horse and easiest to clean up after. Haven't experienced any glitches or hitches.
B0012QVJXS|5.0|We love this movie! It's a classic, that's for sure. The music during the opening is just amazing....!  Worth seeing again and again. There will never be another Superman like Christopher Reeve!
0783229526|2.0|I watched this straight, and thought it was a load of crap. If you were to be tripping, it might be cool.
B008XBHIEY|5.0|Eventhough it's dated, who cares? This is an outstanding movie with a brilliant cast and fantastic special effects. And, needless to say, the music is a standout.
1434441636|3.0|I dint' liked the way the writer lists the paragraphs , for me the reader loses the connection between one paragraph and another and letters are very small.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Can't get enough of this show. It's witty, funny, and without a doubt one of the best shows that I've seen in recent years. Definitely worth checking out.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I was impressed by the soul-searching lyrics that Rod authored. I was also appreciative of the fact that the lyrics were included in the album notes. Let's have more of that!!
B005544V6A|5.0|Can't get enough of this show. It's witty, funny, and without a doubt one of the best shows that I've seen in recent years. Definitely worth checking out.

0812982622|5.0|Great book, it was as expected being a pulitizer prize winner you know you are getting the best read. Recommend
B00932A4XE|3.0|Lots of well known actors, and has a few sweet or funny moments, but it was just a so-so movie.  It was free so I'm not complaining- but I wouldn't want to pay much to watch this one.
0802130208|5.0|Great book, it was as expected being a pulitizer prize winner you know you are getting the best read. Recommend
0679805273|5.0|We bought this as a supplement to a graduation gift for a young friend of ours.<br />He is about to embark on an adventure in his already successful young life and we wanted to mark it with something whimsical that would leave a lasting memory.
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|Absolutely beautiful music. I enjoy all the songs, especially \\"Stars Wars\\"! I love playing this CD while fixing dinner. Great gift idea for birthday or Christmas.
B001AQIYJC|1.0|The worst movie I have ever seen, stupid script, and no angel would want to become human, they know what humans face each day, they are not stupid like Seth. I am probably the only person that thinks this. So sue me!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|comletes my bourne collection till the next one comes up great price better than buying it at a store or movie place.
B001KTATIS|5.0|First and foremost I love Helen Mirren.  The cast was excellent.  It probably represented that time in history accurately, the careless regard and immoral way of life at that time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Just so fun, thrilling, exciting, and intense. Great for kids, and adults you, can play for family game night. Appropriate for kids and great for bonding. They ask you your age so that they can determine that level of difficulty. SOO FUN
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this CD! I can't stop listening to it! It is what every true Queensrÿche fan has been hungering for for years! The hard driving rhythm section is back! The energetic guitars are back! The vocals with the new lead singer and stronger backing vocals are fresh and amazing! This is a MUST BUY for the Queensrÿche fan who lost interest as the band's recent releases mellowed. Tired of the &#34;Adult Alternative Rock&#34; from what used to be a great band? This self titled LP is also being referred to in many reviews as &#34;Queensrÿche Reborn&#34; or &#34;Queensrÿche Rebooted&#34;. It is a return to the sounds that both the band members and fans alike prefer! &#34;Fallout&#34; is high energy. &#34;Open Road&#34; is a great ballad. As expected on any great Queensrÿche CD, this one runs the range of sound! A bit heavier that Empire, this CD shows this band still has what it takes to rise to the top again! Listen for yourself. You won't be disappointed!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I downloaded angry birds friends app on my Kindle Fire for my grandson. He usually plays sports games so it's best to see him play something different for a change. I have played angry birds friends too, it is fun. I love how the birds cheer one another on. My Grandson hates if he's doesn't pass a level that the pigs smile and laugh! He will quickly get off a loss sooo he's doesn't have to see them.
B000063V8R|5.0|We've been slowly rewatching all the NG shows. How exciting to relive these great episodes (sans commercials!) The characters are well thought out and consistent all the way through. If you're a trekkie you probably have this already. If not, why not try out the Next Generation!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|The best around some of my life is the enrollment in my tight juicy fruit and I have a kik but i am a walker a good idea that a walker's and I didn't per tomorrow so happy birthday to the movies with a couple weeks of a lie to the movies today
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I'm a huge John Grisham fan, so was excited tor read this latest book (or at least latest to me!) The story was great as always and anyone who has read Grisham before will be pleased that he continues to put out great novels!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book was a joy to read and had a good ending. I worried about the main character Jamie, all through the book. Good ending all around.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great read! I couldn't put it down... finished it in two days and I can't wait to start the final book!
0375842209|5.0|This is an amazing and captivating story. By the end I was so enthralled it was almost painful to put the book down.<br /><br />Zusak is a masterful storyteller sending your imagination to right to where you are meant to go.<br /><br />Whilst this story is set during WWII and told through the eyes of Death don't think it is a melancholy story. Far from it. Though if by the end of the book if you do not shed a tear I will be surprised. By the end I was literally sobbing and struggling to read through my tears. Don't let that put you off.<br /><br />The emotions this book stirs up is amazing, the talent of a gifted writer.<br /><br />There are so many beautiful moments in this book and importantly the story shows you the cruelty of war on people who truly do not want it or care for the politics of it.<br /><br />If there is one book you need to read before you die it is most definitely this one.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Very addictive and fun. Started playing just to help my  daughter and ended up loving it myself. The puzzles and hidden pictures were challenging but not impossible.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|Could have been a bit more in depth, but liked the way the author wove the story using different character's prospectives. Just read Ann Tyler's &#34;Digging to America&#34; which was about the adoption of two Korean babies. Interesting to learn about the adjustment of the children and the parents in international adoptions.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Fun little app to kill time between work and court. Had it on my phone now have it on my kindle.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|The package arrived in excellent condition.<br />Each CD was in a replica of the original album art complete with extras (if any were there originally) and paper dust jacket.<br />The outer box to hold the set in is thick and sturdy.<br />And the music?...Come on, it's the Beatles, good enough to listen to eight day's a week :)
B000085RTZ|4.0|my daughter thinks it's awesome music<br />It has a great story line, lyrics, and a very dramatic feel, says she.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|This wasn't one of the best choices for my particular taste in movies.  The movie is a little too dark and gory for me.  As far as content, it was probably well done, but again, not my taste.
1616550414|5.0|My daughter's friend likes it so much she carries it with her everywhere and won't let my daughter borrow it.
B005HEPIDS|4.0|voyager is a good star trek version. interesting stories, but seven of nine is the best thing they have done.
B00BB8OHMW|5.0|Having traveled to the areas of England where this story takes place, the &#34;possible&#34; historical facts made for an enjoyable movie.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|So sorry to say that I really can't review this app because it never downloaded to my device. I've never had any problems with other devices in which I rate the app 4 stars. I have The Galaxy S4.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Rented this movie at a sleepover and loved it. I typically don't like long movies or have the attention span to last through them unless they really are good quality. I'd watch this movie again!
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Not as good as his other books but still an enjoyable read.  Found it a bit disjointed and the sub stories did nt always meaningfully join up.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Story line kept me busy waiting for the next chapter. Characters almost seemed too real. I presume there will be another season?
B003UYUP58|5.0|Incredibly interesting for anyone to learn a bit more about a disease which is so ingrained in our lives.<br />Recommend it for anyone looking to expand their knowledge
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|GREAT GAME WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE ON THE LEVELS AND MORE SKILL FULL PIECES TO THE GAME. ABSOLUTELY LIKE IT OTHERWISE.
B00DU74U74|3.0|If you've read Twilight then nothing will be a shocker here, but some medicore acting with a semi-fresh take on space invaders.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Gets a lot of updates to keep things interesting. Helps builds creativity and imagination great for people who can't get the computer version
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I miss the &#34;original&#34; team and when I say &#34;original&#34;, I mean the team I grew up with and enjoyed.  Garcia, Hotch, Morgan, Rossi, Reed, JJ, and Prentiss.  With Prentiss gone, I wasn't sure if I would enjoy the new season but found I have.  The newest member brings a new sense of justice and doesn't instantly stare down the others.  So far its good!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|In love with Downton Abbey - a shame that a season is only 9 episodes, but it is so packed full of drama, DA delivers more than most full season shows. Cliffhanger leaves me breathless for January!
B0050XFY4O|3.0|I don't know what to say about this movie really.  I really lost interest in it half way through and continued on just so I could see if it got better and it didn't for me.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|Twists and turns and deception galore. Former CIA operative, Kate Moore, moves to Luxembourg with her husband Dexter and things will never be the same. Is her husband really a bank IT consultant or is he a thief? Why is the FBI following Kate and Dexter? From Luxembourg to Andorra, DC to Paris, the unravelled skein of plots and cabals keeps the reader unable to put the book down.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|Gaiman has a way of writing simple yet really scary scenarios.  That fine line between fiction and reality.  It's truly a pleasure to read!
B000FC146C|5.0|What a brilliant story you feel like you are part of the story line. I hated to see it end. Loved it Loved it all
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game to keep the kids busy and get them started on taking care of something. Pretty addictive too, need a time limit.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|i like this game the little extra help you get is great when your stuck on a level for days..
B005WUHAX8|4.0|I received my case today, I am skeptical of its performance, I have otter box cases for my other electronics so when I ordered this case I was expecting the same quality material as the Otter Box but less weight. for the price I was expecting something more durable. Once I put the case on as instructed I tried to make a phone call and I realized that the sound was low too none, I had to mess around with the case and the buttons on the phone to get it to adjust so I can hear it, then I tried to plug in my head phones and I realized I can not use them without the Headphone Adapter. I am kind of scared to even put the case with my phone in water, even though it passed the water test without the phone, I am still scared. Otter Box spoiled me, I am expecting this LifeProof case to give me the same performance of a tank, like the Otter Box. I thought I would give this case a try to see if it stands up to its claims.
0763644765|5.0|My daughter loves this book.  She is 19 months and gets excited when she sees it.  The illustrations are rather simple but it works for her!<br />I certainly recommend this book to other young ones.

1781162646|4.0|This is the first Stephen King book I have read in a long time.  It did not disappoint.  The writing will take you back to a different time. It was suspenseful, sad, romantic,and Stephen King-esque.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the most amazing game ever! Nothing can beat this. It changes places there are challenges. You will discover what u <3.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|one of the best miniseries, HBO should do the Paul Revere Miniseries and the George Washington Miniseries too, John Adams is by far a great adaption of the novel of the same title written by David McCullough
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|a friend recommended that I watch this show, and all of a sudden it popped up on amazon prime.  I was hooked from the very first episode of the first season and the show gets better each week.  Unfortunately, I have watched season 1 and 2 and now must wait each week for a new episode.<br />give suits a chance, I think you'll like it.
B0062OCNAI|3.0|It was a good read. At first it was hard to get into but it was full of suspense and emotionally charged as a mother reader.<br />If you like unpredictable, drama filled stories, this is great for you.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|From its first words, this story unfolds in layers rich with promise.  The characters are well-drawn, the storyline woven in richly colored silken threads.  As a lover of words, I was heartened by the breadth of Ms. Harkness' vocabulary.  Throughout I was torn by a desire to know what would come next yet longing to bask in whichever chapter I found myself!  My only trepidation was whether or not the ending, as with other series i have read, would leave me hanging in a state of suspense and uncertainty.  I needn't have feared as this book's ending leaves me in a state of anticipation; hungry for the fulfillment of its promise.
B009GED3HS|5.0|we purchased season 8 through amazon prime after watching the first seven seasons for free through netflix.  great show, wish i could stream it to my phone (like i could on netflix) without having to use either wifi or adobe flash!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|It was a excellent read - I could not put it down, worth the money I spent. Looking forward to more from this author.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|First let me say, I am a fan of classic blues and jazz. To hear the gruff british voice of hugh laurie slide through americana blues and songs of the south is interesting and dance provoking. I love the classics he plays and with the added interest of him crossing from acting to singing brings added interest to a fading american music base. His passion for the music flows out of his music and through your speakers. I highly recommend listening while in the kitchen cause it made me crave gumbo and po'boys while needing room to dance!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|If you are a Columbo fan, you must purchase the complete series.  Although I was a Columbo fan from the start, I didn't see every episode.  However, viewing re-runs has been just as exciting as seeing an episode for the first time.  I am very impressed with the quality of these discs--sharp and clear.  In addition the disc cases are packaged in a nice cardboard box for storage--a plus.  You can't go wrong in purchasing this complete series.  If you're a fan, you won't be sorry.
B004B8DH98|4.0|....not for Clooney anyways. Such a cold bloody killer. Scenery in this movie is gorgeous. Story line I liked. Bang !
B00CRS88IO|5.0|Did you ever pick up a book and catch yourself reading a little longer than you planned when suddenly it lands on you like a truck load of bricks that the author is simply one heck of a writer? That describes my experience exactly when reading \\"Operation Armada\\" of the \\"Ian Fleming Files.\\"<br /><br />The story reads smoothly and the plot is well structured between the ebb and flow of action and some rather humorous exchanges between the characters. The interactions between characters are pure Fleming and any fan will certainly be pleased with this tale. The author stays on point and there are no rambling or irrelevant scenes. The action, drama and adventure keep the story moving and the reader turning the pages.<br /><br />The writing is also well researched. One of the more striking aspects of the story is the description of liquor, cigarettes, clothing, weapons, vehicles and more that immediately surround the reader with European life in the early 1900's, especially that of Ian Fleming. You will immediately feel a part of the setting and Bond fans will instantly feel at home. Long time Bond fans most assuredly bring high expectations to any new story and they will not be disappointed with this one.<br /><br />I enjoyed this well written story. It reads easily and fills every expectation that comes with any Ian Fleming/Bond type of action adventure. Pick up a copy and treat yourself to the latest from Damian Stevenson who has been writing about Ian Fleming for more than a decade. This is an easy book to recommend.
B00190KZUU|5.0|This is one of the best movies to I've seen in a while.  I really loved the way the story is told - and is suitable for children!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I just purchased this app, and I think that this is just what I have been searching for. I really could have used it on my recent trip takes Alaska.
B0050DIWFC|1.0|As the title says, I tried to get through this on a recommendation of co-worker 3 times before I decided it wasn't for me.  I didn't want to hurt her feelings so I kept trying but honestly, the characters are not well developed or even likeable.  I didn't feel like I knew them at all and I was not emotionally invested in them or the plot.  I think for a novel to be sucessful the characters really need to make an impact on the reader and get to them emotionally.  However, I could find no reason to see them as anything but boring and unattached from each other. I got halfway through and I wish I never wasted my time.<br /><br />In short, awful characters following a simple plot makes for a really boring story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|You must read The Hunger Games to truly appreciate the intrigue in this book.  Very thought provoking given our current political climate!
B0088W6LAK|5.0|The concept of Stargate SG-1 is unique (notwithstanding the movie on which it was based) in the Sci-Fi genre. I love that they can laugh at themselves and at their genre, and still be taken seriously as a series and storyline. Season 2 is essential watching for Stargate fans because so much of the foundational principles are established in this season,  Nearly every episode is referenced in a later episode in a later season.  I'm re-watching the entire series and enjoying the ride.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|My headline nails it. I liked seeing Jean Claude getting some screen time. Chuck Norris is always a crowd pleaser too.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Thank you, Marcus Luttrell and to all the Navy Seals who never give up to protect our freedom.  I have a greater appreciation for what you do. You are our heroes!
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|I've attended many Madonna concerts, but this tour has been the best so far.  Awesomely incredible.  This is my review...if you don't like it you know where you can go...........
1400031001|5.0|An excellent book and having seen the series on PBS I still enjoyed this version of it.  I am looking forward to other books by this author.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Really great movie with lots of action, fantastic scenery, Cruise and Freeman at their best. And a really nice ending
B0068LYEHA|5.0|I love this book. I loved reading it and I still love thinking about it and talking about it. So many wise funny words that come back to me in my daily life. Very relevant and clever.
B00DH1G7DS|3.0|good game for passing the time, but in my phone Galaxy S4 International Version the game frost al is needed force the exit! please update it!<br /><br />when that problem is solved! 5 Stars!!!
B0084670FU|3.0|Personally, I think the movie lost some emotion and drama by not following a chronological order like a traditionally movie.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This is a great alarm clock. Easy to use and includes a ton of options to customize the way you like to wake up. I would recommend checking it out.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Big fan of the Marvel Movies and this is probably the best one of the group.  Highly recommend it, but watch the others first to truly appreciate.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game! This is a perfect mental challenge! Please keep the levels coming! I can't get enough of this game!!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I chose 5 stars simply because this book was amazing. I will recommend this book to all my friends.  This book captured everything that I love in stories. I honestly can't say anything bad about it. Enjoy.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|These songs just emotionally ruin me.  I can't explain it. Music is a personal thing but her voice, the music and lyrics all evoke strong emotion which I've read is one of Florence's goals.  She has a beautiful voice and it's really hard to stand still when you listen to the songs - you almost have to move.  I am a 52 year old woman who is always looking for some quality music and I haven't been this impressed since Adele's 21. Florence and Adele are super talented, gifted women.
0618918248|1.0|I assumed Dawkins would have something of value to say but instead found him embarassing himself with his lack of historical and philosophical acumen. There are much better authors than Dawkins to defend the tenets of atheism. Unlike his colleague at Oxford, Alister McGrath, Mr. Dawkins is dangerously ignorant and intolerant. Dramatic provocation is a poor sustitute for thorough research. I recommend that Dawkins stick to his own field of expertise in the future.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book started by getting acquainted with all the characters, and was an enjoyable book to read.  It helped me see the importance of how time, emotions and the amazing love we can take for granted,  is so valuable.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This game is a lot of fun! You can even connect it with your Facebook account. My kids really enjoy playing as much as I do!
B008JFUN6E|1.0|I go to movies to be entertained - not indoctrinated and this movie is nothing but indoctrination.  The rich white people vs the poor Mexicans who now make up all of Los Angeles - complete with grinding poverty, filth and graffiti.  Of course, the rich white people are all portrayed as cold and heartless and the criminal Mexicans are really good down deep.<br /><br />The entire premise of this movie is that if they won't give us what we want, we'll just take it and destroy as much as we can of their paradise in the process - very much like what is happening is Los Angeles today.  It is very disappointing to see someone of Jodie Foster's caliber being involved in something like this.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I could not put this book down. It's a great sci-fi read for all ages. I cannot wait until the movie comes out. The upcoming release of the movie made me revisit this book after many years and it was better than I remembered. I don't think I'll read Speaker For The Dead even though it clearly sets it up for the sequel. But I do think I'll read Ender's Shadow!
6304711905|5.0|I prefer this film of Tomstone better than any other.<br />Do love Val Kilmer as &#34;Doc&#34;  What a great actor
B00DHRLK84|1.0|total waste of a movie in both time spent watching it and the money spent to see it. Wish I could have got a refund.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|i'm a buddhist and I believe in nature. So, it is no doubt about fasting is fact key to loose weight. But, this book talking and give the detail base on the scientific support which some can find on the medical journal. Good for starting to learn and earn the benefit from fasting not only the weight loss, but the healthy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I only began the series because I saw an ad about the movie. Did not take long to get hooked! The games are a small part of the story about a corrupt government, shows clearly the fault of blind faith in leadership. Shows how a small band of rebels can create a ripple of change.
B000IMKDPC|4.0|a good watch. i would watch it again. not all the good characters were introduced but it was still fun to watch
B004XANKVO|4.0|I like the bag, but one downside is the main pack is so large that it's easy to overpack which might lead to damage to anything in the computer storage area.  The straps have metal buckles, which will get pretty hot when sitting in the sun.  Overall it's a great bag with plenty of storage.
B000JFDBXO|3.0|hard core Marvel fans , just don't do it. Its a fun movie but not accurate. its just for the action
B0023ZLI42|3.0|This book is a good start but is overrated. everyone loves this book except me. i bought this book in kindle format and also bought the volume 1 dvd version 2.0. I bought another kindle book called the fustrated guitarist last chord book that had more chord examples (minor chords) and a very helpful way of thinking about the patterns and i gave that book a lousy review. The scale patterns in the fretboard logic book are dumb and i would never use them. a good book with scales is the kindle book building the better guitar scale which is $1 and a must read.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|If you only buy one album this year, this is it. Fall Out Boy has put a little of everything in here and still remained true to themselves as a band.
B000L9EKL0|5.0|I've always loved this movie! Will watch it again. It&#34;s dealing with the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. yes sir
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|Id love to give this game a 5 star rating because once it works it'll be a lot of fun BUT besides the loading and refreshing issues, which I could live with, the worst thing is that I constantly get someone else's farm presented. meaning I rarely get to play with my farm, instead I get a farm presented which is clearly not mine. After deinstalling and reinstalling over and over again and contacting the mighty creators of the game it still hasn't been resolved!!!<br />I read of others who experience the same problem and im surprised it hasn't been fixed yet.<br /><br />once this issues are taken care of im more than happy to give it 5 stars, until then its not even worth the one star I had to give in order to post a review.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is totally awesome! I built a humongous mansion with at least 20 rooms and each 25 by 25!
1400034779|5.0|It's good to read a book that concentrates on the goodness and intelligence of people instead of their criminality. Yes
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app so much. its really fun and if u rate it u get 3 gems. its fun too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its so good and fun its so boss!!! its awesome! minions are the best!! YOU GO DAVE!!!!!!!! minion rush is better than anything!
B00002MZ12|5.0|This is an excellent set of AM from MTV - great compilation of her work (watch some of these live on U-tube).  Intimate setting so you don't get the type of echo etc. from the venue  you usually get from large scale live performances.  This is very &#34;listenable&#34; even if you are not typically a fan of live performances.  Highly recommend!
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|This is the least likeable Die Hard movie. I think this movie was just made to earn money but not necessarily to entertain people who love action movies with a good story.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|This movie was better than the first one.  Still a lot of dialog but you got a deeper understanding of the characters and their lives in this film.  Can't wait to see the next one.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Christoph Waltz, Leonardo Dicaprio and Jamie Fox delivered a memorable performance in this movie. I loved every second of this film.
B001NA6096|3.0|I wanted to watch all of these movies in succession based on the hype of the most recent in the series.  I love the concept but I was a little underwhelmed by this movie.  It was too much dialog for my taste.  I did like the cliff hanger at the end and that is what will keep me watching and hoping for more from the next one.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I had not read Baldacci until this book, and I am now having to go back and read some of his earlier work.  This is a great story, with a central character who is not your typical 'hero'.  Will Robie is cerebral, quiet, and unassuming, but no one is better in action then he is.  This is as much a 'who done it' as it is an action adventure, and we meet some intriguing characters along the journey Baldacci takes us on.  This is a masterful book done by a masterful storyteller, and I loved it.
B005HCI72O|4.0|This series of books is addictive. Reader beware once you start reading the first book Outlander you won't be able to put it down! Beautifully written
B00ECUARO8|1.0|I would give this movie no stars, if I could. But they make you give it at least one star. This movie was so bad, we barely made it through the first hour. After an hour we agreed we just couldn't waste another minute and turned it off. With lifeless, empty characters and a storyline that was as far from original as possible, it took actual will power to suffer through the first hour of the movie. At each 15 minute interval we said, okay, let's just give it 15 more minutes. Finally, we gave up. You should, too. Don't waste the $3.99 or the two hours of your life you'll never get back.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|as the story became more unbelievable i thought the author was toying with the reader. really did not like ending where the author tells us the story is a lie.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very easy read.  Not technically written but informational.  Love that he talked about his equipment and you truly got the feel of how exhausting it was in Iraq.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game makes me smile.  It is fast paced and so far pretty easy to play.  The kindle platform is good for this game.
B00B0A5XQU|5.0|It was good story. Very moving and funny. I would recommend it to everyone. Great for women and men to read.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I really like to play this game it's awesome! But I wish you didn't have to purchase coins to play other than that it's a great game
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Tolkien is one of my all time favorite authors and so enjoy this movie.  My order was easy to place and as always, I was very pleased that it arrived so quickly!  I love the Hobbit!
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Loved the special effects. I really liked Jack and the princess' relationship. She was a feisty. I like strong women characters.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This book has it all:  blood, humor, love, believalbility, and content!  Easy to relate to present day world situations and places.
B00CATSONE|4.0|The true genius of Mr. Tesla often goes unnoticed. He is indeed the imagineer of our age. A good read and a treasure of knowledge for all ages.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Great love story and historical fiction. I am now reading the book and want to watch the 1970's version with Patrick Stewart.
B0032FPVKE|1.0|I should have heeded the warning of others who said this bag was too small...much smaller than it appears. And it has the nerve to have a divider in the main compartment. LOL  I took the precaution to measure my camera against the product size indicated. My camera won't fit in this bag.<br /><br />I believe this bag was a return, because there was no shoulder strap as indicated and the packaging had already been opened. I would say it is poor quality because it is not cut and/or sewn evenly. I don't know the quality of the zippers. The pulls on the zippers have a nice Amazon logo on them, but if I were Amazon, I'd be ashamed to put my name on this bag.<br /><br />To me, it isn't worth the trouble to return. I'll just throw it in my box of stuff for the Goodwill. Maybe they can sell it for 50 cents. I'm really disappointed in Amazon for selling something as new and mailing it to me. My trust of Amazon has taken a plunge. I'm off to the store (with my camera) to find a suitable bag.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|After seeing this movie I fell in love with the soundtrack. I am so glad I bought this. It has all the best songs from the movie.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I couldn't put this book done. From the very first page to the very end you become so intrigued by Will and Layken's relationship. This was a very quick read, but an amazing read as well. I believe this book was as good as Coleen Hoover's other book Hopeless.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I found the story an enlightening tale of this very average family with their son who is a young man of a certain higher intellect than the average adolescent.<br /><br />Although it was slow moving at times I found it very truthful in its own and couldn't hurt to have our children for generations read this.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|Excellent !!  Very much worth viewing. I missed out for a number of years, but better late than never.<br />Excellent effects and photography.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Once you get used to the interface, it is a great puzzle that provides hours/weeks of entertainement. Occasionally it has to reconnect to amazon or won't let me play, not sure why.
630587493X|5.0|This is not a children's film which is OK for others to see when they have to, it is a film which is accessible to all at their own level of understanding. It is a warm yet not too schmaltzy family movie which tells the story of a robot with special faculties who becomes a  well-loved family member, is given his freedom and then goes out into the world to find another robot like himself. All the \\"human\\" actors do their part nobly and Robin William's voice is right on target. It is a warm, charming story that, happily in this day of Vampires and blood soaked screens, hits the right key at the beginning and retains it throughout. For a \\"feel-good\\" evening this is perfect.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My son loves this game and its so easy he is seven. So it's perfect for his age. Great for all ages.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|I've been reading this book now for about a week or so and every time I picked it up I didn't want to put it down. Unfortunately I didn't have enough time to just read and never stop, so I've been reading when I had the time. Its a good mystery, although I did find the ending a little disappointing at first, but when I finished the book I learned to appreciate it. Over all I'd give this book a 4.7 out of 5<br /><br />I hope you enjoy.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|it is crisp and fresh and just as good today as ever. not dated, incredibly well done. a must see
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I started using feedly to replace Google reader. I later started using the app on both my phone and my kindle. I love it. It has a clean look and is easy to navigate. Please don't screw it up.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|when do they study? my college was never like this.  A good story, entertaining. Well acted, an update on collegelife for us fuddy duddies.
B005K17RU0|2.0|The new updated interface is cluttered, badly formatted, and difficult to navigate. I miss being able to see extended forecast at a glance. I uninstalled after the update.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This app is amazing. There are two pictures and you put them together and type them in. Get it! It is amazing!
B008YW5RH2|5.0|It is a lot of fun, easy to learn, but addictive!  I Definitely recommend it over all other free games.
B00C9PQ7I8|5.0|I saw Mavis Staples on TV and had to have this album.  I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.!
B009K916ZK|5.0|Its great!!  worked perfectly.  I use it to do presentations !  Love it so simple to use. Product was exactly as adversited.
0761172726|5.0|Always nice to have so many months head to plan. Each member of our family has a space for their own schedule.
B00005K9LM|5.0|It's by far one of the best Judas Priest albums of all time.  The redo of the song Defenders of the Faith is pretty awesome.
B0073LWEXK|2.0|I'm not much of a gamer, let me just preface my review by saying, but I do like a little adventure with an interesting storyline.  This game gives you that as a start, but then leaves you alone to figure it all out.  I wandered aimlessly from screen to screen, no idea where I was or what I was supposed to be looking for, no story to follow from place to place.  There's a map function you can refer to, but once you decide where you need to be, you can't just jump there from the map, you have to return to wherever you are, try to remember which screens you used to get there and how to get where you need to go.  Difficult, since you're wandering around in the jungle and it all looks alike and is all colored with the same tones.  The clues page is spectacularly useless as it tells you to do something on such and such number screen, but there are no numbers ON the screen when you are there, they're only a reference on the map, which you cannot look at concurrent with whatever site you're exploring.  Hurumph!  I've played it now to four or five hours and still have no emotional investment in the story, couldn't care less about doing whatever it is I'm supposed to be doing there.  Such a disappointing game to me.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|There are times you watch a movie and you can't escape the fact that it is a movie.  This movie captures you and really brings you into the story.  After seeing this movie I understand why this movie can not be told so well in 2d.  It must be seen as intended in 3D to full get the connection to the experience.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I thought I'd enjoy a stand-alone clock function, but it turns out to be something I never pull up.  The clock face styles are nice--I especially like the look of the face with the time in words that &#34;light&#34; up--but I just about never use my Kindle Fire as merely a clock appliance standing on my table.  If it's on, I'm probably actively using it for something, or numerous somethings, so I couldn't say I've pulled up this app in months.  Maybe if it would verbally wake me up in the morning, give me a complete weather forecast, then start my coffee, I'd be more likely to use it.  Until then, it remains way down my list of favorite apps through no real fault of its own.
B0060QM09M|4.0|I thought I was going to be reading a WWII book. It was really about a young man sharing his life as an animal doctor in a village in England.  He did have some WWII experinces while he served his country.  It certainlly is worth reading because it was so well written.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|fun challenging easy to play. getting coins is difficult though. I guess that's how they make money off this app.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|Lots and lots of plot. The characters are lovable though at times inconsistent. The world created by Ryan is both creative and vast though I often felt like I knew so little about any of its detail, which really isn't a criticism but more my wish to keep exploring this new fantasy world. The portions we do get to see are possessing both width and depth. This is a nice balance of old traditional fantasy and the gritter overtly tragic world of many other authors.
B009WUBERW|3.0|kind of fun watching the old action hero guys do there thing, amazing how they dont get killed with all the weapons going off around them. The puns are bad but fun,<br />Dont expect great acting its fun for what it is.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is great fun. Tough enough to keep you working but not impossible to get. If you enjoy a little brain workout you will like this.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love it this game plays with your mind and helps you for future investigations also the game has all theses parts that you need to find to get to the next level so have fun and download
B00CEJ2H6K|4.0|awesome, just awesome.  Amon Amarth never seems to disappoint me.  This cd is the natural progression from Twilight and Surtur.  If you liked their other material, you'll like this one as well.<br /><br />The bonus EP is fantastic as well.  Stand Up To Go Down is hilarious!
B0001CNRSE|5.0|I loved this movie and loved the music.  LIttle Romeo was magnificent, as were the other actors and actresses.  Truly a must-have for dance and hip-hop fans, although I am well-passed that  age-group, which goes to show if someone 66 can love, this I'm sure people much, much younger can too.
B00ATP24SW|5.0|One of the few albums worthy of 5 stars.  It's just brilliant.  All of the songs are well constructed.  It's amazingly produced.  The musicianship is fantastic.  The vocals are superb.  Really, it's the best epic metal cd that's come out since Wintersun - Time (although it's a bit more power driven than folk).<br /><br />Just stop wasting time, buy it and be happy.
B005SQ3AI0|5.0|I loved this!  I ordered this for one album, September In the Rain, an album I bought in 1962, when I was only 15.  But, the other albums I weren't familiar with like Dinah Jams and others were incredible, and she had some fine musicians working with her and this is an excellent CD with excellent sound-quality.
B00BX3KZAS|3.0|It's good.  All of it is technically brilliant but there aren't any songs that really stand out to me yet.  It's kind of like Blooddrunk where you can enjoy the CD from front to back but you don't really NEED to have it on repeat for a month (which is sad because Relentless Reckless Forever stayed in stereo all year).<br /><br />As of now I'd say pick it up to complete your collection but it's not a cd to start with if you're trying to get into the band.  Maybe it'll grow on me or something.
1576875776|4.0|really nice to see how she was into urban life<br />very delicate view of people<br />nice to compare now and then<br />I sugest fro any one who want's to  in the streets this days<br />to take a look t this book
B0055OK2T0|5.0|This was a pretty cool spin on time travel or whatever it was that they were doing when they darted in and out of the doors that took them across the entire city. I was not quite sure what the Bureau Guys were supposed to represent  I am guessing a higher power of some sort but the movie held my interest. I also love a happy ending and this movie delivered just that.
3836538725|5.0|unbelievable how we still have this paradises on our world un touched<br />beautiful pictures<br />hope this open the eyes of every human in this planet
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I guess I should not have rented this movie. I knew before I did it was not my type of entertainment. The movie was for my husband who is the history buff, but even he could not stay awake for it. I loved the actors in the move so I thought I would give it a shot.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|This was the first Final Fantasy game I've ever played, and I have to say, I was excited to see it for the kindle. It's almost as if it's meant for the kindle itself! I would recommend getting this for anyone who loves final fantasy or the legend of Zelda! It's a five star for me!
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I am a sucker for a happy ending and this movie delivers. The charactors were mostly likeable and pretty much predictable but as I said I love a happy ending. Sure it was a spin on Zombie Land ( which is another movie I loved) and The Walking Dead but it was a comedy and had a different ending then the other two zombie shows.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I don't understand all of this hate on this app....It works excellent for me! The downloading speed is great (depending on your internet speed) and isn't malicious at all. I would get it if you love YouTube videos; plus, it's a more efficient way to save your favorite videos!
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Great movie, action and comedy what a great mix!!!!  I even laughed watching it by myself.  I can't wait to see RED 2.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|I know they had a short amount of time to cover this book. The craziness of Kevin,Erin's husband was not done very well. And the gentleness and understating of duhaml's character was down
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Another great book from Nesbo. I enjoyed it from beginning to end and look forward to continuing with his work.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|its a really fun and can be challenging its a very addicting game<br />and everyone should get this game and play it lol
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|never ending LOVE it and it is right up my alley it is the best game ever you should buy it
B000EMGAOY|5.0|These album is one of da best that the red hot chili peppers this 2disc set is in perfect condition thank Amazon
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Simply put, over the last couple years I try other keyboard apps and give them a fair try but always keep coming back to SwiftKey. They just have such a refined and customizable app. I love it.
B008H5J510|5.0|Awesome effects, beautiful 3d and very much enjoyed! Keep it coming Katy!<br />Justice for Kurt Cobain. Cobain Case dot Com
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I loved this book. I've read several other books on this same topic and they made it seem 100x more difficult than the process really is. This is my first book published through KDP and it was very easy. Another book told me that I couldn't import my book from Word to the Kindle program and told me I had to learn HTML. Really? Who has the time for that? This book laid out step by step instructions which I followed and the book looks amazing! Seriously if you are planning on publishing through KDP this is the only book you need. It is direct from the creators, simple, easy, quick. That way you can get back to doing what you love which is your writing. I can't take back the time I spent reading that other book and wish I had found this first.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|If you like love stories, this is the movie for you.  I love the music in it and the story is so romantic.
B00821PCJS|4.0|I will watch this series as it is available. I really liked it. Thanks for this product. I love Prime and all of the benefits attached.
0316201545|5.0|Having thoroughly enjoyed Chris Colfer's [[ASIN:0316201561 The Land of Stories: The Wishing Spell]] I looked forward to the sequel with great anticipation. I promised myself I would take my time and read it slowly, but the book proved impossible to put down, and I finished it in record time. Well-drawn and lively characters, sparkling dialogue and a wonderful, engaging story makes this a fantastic journey for kids of all ages. Magical!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This is a wonderful story. I hope the upcoming movie does the book justice. Am urging my daughter to start reading the series
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|by the time I started getting into the story line, I only had 35 more minutes left in the movie. Costumes were great. Story line......meh!
B008JFUO36|3.0|Yes, here is yet ANOTHER \\"apocalyptic flick\\" in a long list of other apocalyptic themed movies this year.<br /><br />This movie is strange.  Set in 2077, on a \\"war ravaged earth\\", our hero Tom Cruise (Jack) and his partner Vicka have the important job of harvesting water and other ecological necessities for human's new place of residence, Titan.<br /><br />Jack is the one who has to do the \\"dirty work\\" - going down to the ground to battle the \\"Scavs\\" that have taken over earth.  (The scavs are the aliens that waged the war on humans to begin with)...while Vicka, on the other hand (a woman who is way too neat and sexily dressed to really be believable in this type scenario, but oh well...) never leaves the tall luxurious tower they are stationed in.<br /><br />Yes, they are romantically involved.<br /><br />Is this movie interesting?  Yes, in it's own way.  It is certainly VISUALLY interesting, and Tom Cruise does a great job as the main character.  (Some men may find Vicka visually interesting, as well).<br /><br />But is it INTERESTING?????  Well....sort of.  I mean, the movie does suck you in and holds your interest - although I did feel, at times, that there could have been \\"more\\" - more character development, more emotion...just \\"MORE\\".  However, I do feel the movie is worth watching ONCE....now would I watch it again?  Since I know all the little secrets and interesting twists (which I will not divulge) I can't see myself watching the flick again, any time soon.  It did seem to drag a bit in places too, unfortunately.<br /><br />Over all, though, I would recommend seeing Oblivion at least once.  It's worth it.  Perhaps watch in on Pay Per View as opposed to purchasing.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|It would have been better if there was a hints guide.<br />I didn't like that whenever you went out of a level you had to start that level from scratch.
B005IT0V8O|5.0|My first introduction to this was a thousand years ago during high school English.  I used it again off and on during college, and now I'm puttering about writing again.  The kindle version works well for me.
B007FLHW3K|5.0|I was searching up cool bike lights on youtube and came across the monkeylectric m210 bike lights. Watched the video and was very impressed by how it works and all the neat designs. After done watching the video, I placed the order for 2 Monkeylectric M210 bike lights and they arrived about 2 to 3 days later. Installed them immediately and took by bike out the very same day. As soon as I was out, people start pulling me over and asking questions about my bike lights and how they work. One person even told me that she liked my monkey lights even though they are inactive. And some other people even called me the light guy because I have like 5 other lights mounted on my bike. Overall, one of the best purchases I ever made and will continue riding in the night with them whenever possible in a safe and fun manner. Thanks Monkeylectic :)
B00B9HTK1S|5.0|This is certainly a suspenseful and fantastic mystery, as is always with A.C. Doyle. I had to read this for our school's Summer Reading Program, and I couldn't put it down; it had me on the edge of my seat, especially near the end. I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys mysteries or simply working out problems until you find the solutions. (However, the mind of Mr. Sherlock Holmes is far too complex for me to understand everything. If you can figure out the entire solution before too much is revealed, I congratulate you.) I chose this rating because it was one of those books that really make you think, and I like those kinds of books. Also the longest short story I have ever read. Happy reading to you all!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Watching Lark Rise is like reading a great book that you just can't put down. One of the best British shows I have seen.
B009AMANH4|4.0|This film told me more about the politics of the era than I knew, and how hard it was to get slavery abolished.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|One must ask: doesn't Cruise get bored with playing the same over-the-top character? This isn't a film; it is a two hour plus advertisement for sleek cars, six-pack abs, and a wardrobe out of Banana Republic. It's like watching an issue of Men's Fitness. Yawnnnnnnn
B007SYWFRM|4.0|love the game but it could use more than one mini game. Once you get to a certain size all there is is waiting.
B00BB8Q1RQ|5.0|The production is excellent, as is the cast. A fascinating and moving portrait of a time and place. Highly recommended.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Overall this game is lots of fun. But the amount of tokens u have become a problem and u can't continuously play like u want unless u buy the tokens
B00CH87HF4|5.0|great game, too focus on the store. and you really have to grind a lot other than that great game
B00AW57L96|5.0|Great read with a few hidden twists .... not too heavy but morally thought provoking! Have recommended this book to friends!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The whole series is wonderful to watch.  However I was VERY sad and upset with the last scene.  I hated for Matthew  to die especially at such a beautiful time for he and Mary.  My hope is that he really doesn't die when the next season begins.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I love power point and word and i just like playing with it. Since my laptop dyed i couldnt use word or power point, till i found king soft for android. Its great
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|This was an amazing movie, not just the rich visuals but also the story.  I absolutely loved this movie and I cannot wait to see it again.  The only thing is I wished I had seen it on the big screen when it came out.  The entire cast was wonderful, and especially the venerable Morgan Freeman and Tom Cruise.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awesome game and awesome graphics,love to play whenever i have the chance. All time one of my favorite games. 2 thumbs up
140006922X|3.0|The one and five star reviews of Zealot by Reza Aslan are more a reflection of the culture wars that consume us when it comes to diverging points about religion and politics than the contents of this not-so-shocking, but limited portrayal of  Aslan's historical Jesus.  Ironically, it is hardly worth all the invective spewed on its behalf.<br /><br />First, the Good News (pun intended)...Zealot is more then engagingly written.  At times it is evocative.  Chapters on the The Temple rituals of the ancient Jews and the ministry of John The Baptist are superb.  One can smell the incense, hear the bleating lambs and feel the water wash over the baptized.  Aslan's creative writing background serves him well and is always evident throughout the narrative. His initial argument-- Jesus continues a Hebraic tradition of Zealotry (religiously philosophical if not [yet] political) is perfectly cogent.<br /><br />Aslan's explanation of the New Testament admonition \\"render unto Cesar...\\" is fine and nicely lays the ground work for his argument.  Afterward arguments are pushed too far or the author applies a \\"convenient\\" (the kindest interpretation) methodology.  When the Gospels or Acts agree with Aslan they are authentic; when they bolster the view that Jesus viewed himself as the son of God or mankind's salvation they are false--patinas added later to \\"gloss over\\" the revolutionary nature of Aslan's historical Jesus.  What is Aslan's proof?  None.  It just is.  It is all rather reminiscent of the DaVinci Code--which in a work that purports to be a historical biography is not a good thing.<br /><br />This methodology ignores tomes of historical research that depicts a more spiritual and nuanced historical Jesus.  One doesn't have to believe Jesus is the Son of God to accept the reasonable interpretation that HE did, as did his Apostles.  Perhaps Aslan is so enamored of his point of view that he can't acknowledge the extensive scholarship that has shown a) it is entirely possible that Jesus was more literate than Aslan believes and b) as Jesus' reputation for miracles grew, so too did the perception that he was more than the standard \\"magical prophet.\\" Aslan is so in the thrall of his \\"illiterate peasant\\" narrative a man of Jesus' background couldn't possibly have challenged the scribes. By his lights, Abraham Lincoln's background and education disqualifies him from being our greatest president or the author of the Gettysburg Address.  A log cabin farmer?  Nah....<br /><br />Nobody, including Aslan need believe in the authenticity of these miracles to believe that Jesus' contemporaries did so.  By extension, Jesus' Apostles and Disciples regarded  him as more than just another human messiah.  That is a matter of note completely absent from Zealot.  Also, the author is prone to sweeping, and I think foolish generalities:  \\"Jesus was not a fool....God's sovereignty could not be established except through force.\\"  Really?  So Gandhi, Mandela and King didn't happen?  There are no alternatives to force when it comes to overthrowing oppression? What a perfectly foolish remark considering the three 20th century preachers of non-violence all succeeded following what they believed was the example of Jesus. Aslan fails to consider that whether the miracles are real or not the fact that those who believe them real (then and now) are also a part of the historical Jesus narrative.<br /><br />Happily, Zealot ends strongly with a section on the tension between Jesus' brother James (representing the Jewish connection to Christianity) and the Pauline strain (hellenistic with no emphasis on The Law). It is quite well done, providing reasonable explanations for the fissure between the two groups.  Until the destruction of Jerusalem, 70 CE James held sway over Paul's version of Judeo-Christianity. With Jewish religion and society in tatters, Pauline teaching had no difficulty becoming ascendent.  It  is not original, but nicely synthesized. Unfortunately, the footnotes really are appallingly inadequate. What the author calls endnotes obscure as much as inform.  Really shoddy. Good luck making sense of them.<br /><br />So...at the risk of  displeasing both the one and five star camps (probably a good thing), read the always well written, occasionally interesting, but ultimately seriously flawed Zealot by Reza Aslan.  Take all the extreme reviews with a big grain of salt and decide for yourself.otnotes really are appallingly inadequate. What the author calls endnotes obscure as much as inform.  Really shoddy.

B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Awesome game true gun game<br />All guns are all correct<br />Every gun is great and I like how the guns have attachments
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I thought all three books were very good. I got pass all the sex and really enjoyed the journey and Christian and Anastasia.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|This book offers a unique outlook on how to live life in order to reach success. It's enjoyable to read Deepak's perspective on life and beyond and how the energies of the universe work together. The seven laws are truly simple and applicable to anyone's situation. I find myself really trying to approach situations differently after reading this book.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|I enjoyed this game and only needed to use hints a few times.  It took me awhile to figure out that the hint button is in your backpack along with the notebook.  Buy and enjoy. I plan to play it again.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|It's a short and fun game to play. It isn't all that scary, but I think it's over priced. I was able to finish the game in ten minutes, so for me, it wasn't worth $2.99
B007Z5WMCW|2.0|Not sure what the problem is but on the Android device it would take forever to begin displaying the channel info, and will come and go seemingly &#34;at will&#34;.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Its cute with different style options and lots of variety and a amazing pictures that makes this such a relaxing game
B004AFFZNI|5.0|I got this to allow for the GoPro to pick up some audio and it works quite well. Allows for awkward access to the ports, but nothing that can't be overlooked. Good buy!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|this is one of those games that make the free app of the day worth going through it cute and awesome
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|It was great at first but now when I tap the app  the screen goes black then after a couple seconds it goes back to the home screen
B0043VDIAG|3.0|pretty good for a romance. not a big fan of book with insane people in them but it was an easy read so i guess its good
B00153ZC8Q|5.0|Ah, yes The Terminator, a name that many are familiar with. The Terminator has become a major franchise that has spawned three sequels, and several video games, and has even spawned action figures for collectors to keep as memorabilia of such a great film. It is basically about a cyborg sent from the future to the present to locate a woman and destroy her, so the future can be altered to the antagonist's liking. The special effects are pretty advanced for the time, considering that this was made in 1984, when computers were not as advanced as they are today. There is no reason for any Sci-Fi fan to miss out on this classic, The Terminator is really a one of a kind film.
B008JFUN6E|5.0|Love Matt Damon and Jodie Foster, so wasn't disappointed at all with this sci-fi film.  Very entertaining, great story, and quick paced.  I have to admit that the villain played by Sharlto Copley was spot on -- hated him thoroughly. LOL.<br /><br />Yes, the story is very utopian, but so what?  It's a fantasy.  Not sure if I would call this a feel good movie, but I'll say that it had a good ending.
B002W1UEW4|4.0|I was a child of the 80s, and lately I have been seeing a lot of movies based on TV shows from that time. Something I notice about all these movies is the more popular the TV show was the less the fans like the movie.<br /><br />I think there is a simple explanation for this, and the explanation is overdeveloped expectations. The more familiar fans are with a TV show like GI Joe, the more they expect the movie to be a continuation of the show. When that doesn't happen the fans are let down, and what is otherwise a great movie gets bad reviews.<br /><br />Fortunately for me I never paid much attention to GI Joe as a kid, and was able to watch this movie with an open mind without expectations of what it should look like. What I found was a reasonably entertaining movie no better or worse than most other action flicks.<br /><br />The lesson here is that when a movie is based on a TV show fans of the show are almost always going to complain about the movie.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I consider myself a fan of both Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman.  I was disappointed with this film.  It was very slow moving at the beginning and by the time there was a little more action, I had lost interest in the characters.  There were a few surprise twists in the plot with a predictable ending. I should probably give it 2 stars but I'm a fan of the lead actors :)
B008602KQI|4.0|I think this is a good movie but I think anyone who could come up with an idea like this is sick in the head
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|All around great film - and beautiful cinematography with a cutting edge job on the color correction - everything is razor sharp.  Beautiful work. Can't wait to see it on Bluray.<br /> (A hats off to the RED camera for knocking it out of the park and of course the color grader @ WB Maxine Gervais)<br /> If nothing else, purchase this film to wonder how...just how did a few helicopters manage to transport these bizillion pound robots to their destinations? ha ha!<br /> A hysterical throwback joke to the older genre films.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Plane and simple, this movie is fantastic, exciting, triply, fun, funny, clever, and more triply. You haven't seen the movie if you haven't seen the director's cut. Or you could go to the website, which I recommend, but still this is worth it
B004X6PRO6|5.0|The Orphan Master's Son is intricately designed - this book is art. It also pulls back the curtain for a peak into North Korea.
B00006AW63|1.0|I wasn't aware that I was ordering a Region 2 dvd.  When I contacted seller to return it, they provided comments that I could most likely set my player to use the dvd.  Research proved I cannot override this setting on my dvd player.  I could return the dvd, at my expense, to the seller.  That is my option.  Return postage exceeds value of the disc.  I made an error in selection.  Lesson learned.
B009AY04A8|5.0|Interesting plot line.  Hours of fun and enjoyable mini games.  I highly recommend it.  The graphics are phenomenal.  There is a variety of activities to keep you involved.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Focused mainly on certain characters, with other characters (you want to read about) left for the next book.  That surprised me, but I did enjoy what was here. George mentioned in the afterword it was either this or a big &#34;To Be Continued&#34; at the end as the story got too large for one book.  I think I may have preferred that, but still recommended to any Game of Thrones fan.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|Its fun and free. You cant go wrong. Some emojis are obvious but some are a little bit challenging its a good app!
B002NN5F7A|4.0|I've seen this movies so many times but I just love it.  Great cast and great story line.  Highly recommend.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Fantastic app and it looks great on the kindle. Nice large screen and functional for daily use. Very helpful buy wish the screen would rotate
B00CH26TL8|3.0|Easy to play. Overall goal is understood, but poor job of informing user of instructions and strategies. Priced well, it is free!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Very good game great game love this game best game on kindle fire hd best game out there best game on the kindle
0756405890|5.0|Easily one of the best pieces of Fantasy I have read in a long time.  Kvothe is flawed, but it his flaws that make him an interesting character.  The world Rothfuss has created is rich, the supporting cast feels real, and overall, its something I can, and have, read, multiple times
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|Everyone who has listened to my copy of this album have been blown away and love it. He will be compared to Bob Dylan and early rolling stones and Donovan, which is daunting praise for a young kid on his first release, but this is a great debut album that covers a lot of different moods. Enjoy
0756407915|5.0|Loved this just as much as book1.  Now, just have to wait for Book 3.  Still dont see how he is going to wrap all of the twists and turns up in one more book, unless it is Veeeery long.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Ok first off the graphics are great for a Mobile game....Secong its fun with lots of control options...Third it is the best racing game ive come across on the Amzon App store.
B0045HCJT4|5.0|Great Movie !
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|The fact that something is bold and this ornate is on television is simply mind boggling. It's got production values to rival &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34; and the world feels massive on a scale that is unprecedented on television.<br /><br />The cast is spot on perfect, with Sean Bean providing the backbone and Peter Dinklage bringing some great lighter moments. The story and characters are sprawling and complex yet not all that difficult to follow. There might be a few too many young men with beards among the Winterfell clan but you'll get used to identifying them all with practice.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray is well put together and looks fantastic with a great array of extras.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great app! It helps me know when my Kindle will go out on long car rides and airplane trips. I did not plan to get this app, but my brother found it on the app store and downloaded it so here it is!!! (Our Kindles are on the same account) Anyways, it also tells you how many hours you spent listening to music, watching TV, etc. I would reccomend this app to all Kindle Fire users. ;-)
B0060MYM7O|5.0|After such an astounding first season it's no small accomplishment that this second season is just as good. New characters are added, but thankfully at a pace which is managable. This is a massive story that's growing all the time and yet it's surprisingly easy to follow. The episodes individually as well as the season as a whole are expertly paced in how they jumps between locations and characters.<br /><br />It's great video and audio quality with a very nice bundle of extras, including some very informative commentaries and trivia information about any given episode.<br /><br />The only thing is that it ends on a bit of an off note. The final episode feels more like it is setting up the next season than putting any kind of a button the season that's just past. It's not a bad episode, but it's a bit of a soft note to end on, especially after the spectacular &#34;Blackwater&#34; which preceeded it.
0345803507|4.0|Haven't read it yet.  Friends been borrow it to read.  They are really enjoying it.  I can hardly wait to get<br />my hands on it.
B0024CEY36|4.0|Quite interesting but you know the end from the very begining. I wish the next will be better. Good luck
0345803485|4.0|Haven't read it yet.  Friends been borrow it to read.  They are really enjoying it.  I can hardly wait to get<br />my hands on it.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book takes me on an unusual and fascinating trip through truly dark places. It is a genuinely innovative way to approach the crime/thrilller-genre, highly recommended!

B00D3V85FA|4.0|this album is good but lacks the kick Im used to from sabbath. the clearity of Ozzys voice just seemed odd.
B008JFUO36|4.0|not his best work, but the plot line was nice and the graphics was great in places, I enjoyed it, glad I waited until the DVD came out.
B00E193TM2|5.0|the usual mix we hv come to expect. Lift me up featuring Rob Halford was awesome. Mama said knock u out was worth a chuckle
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Interesting. Grabbed my attention . Cant wait to get back to it.I think its cool to read on the hd
B0074QGGK6|3.0|It's Short, Very Short!<br />Well initially it was an interesting treatment of the familiar premise, you know \\"There's nothing new under the sun\\" and kind of a quirky how-to of creativity.<br />The first part of the essay explored that, adding interesting examples, fun illustrations and quotes from various visual artists and writers.  But after that,the treatise turns into a lecture on discipline.  Ho hum.  Make a calendar, get up early, keep your nose to the grindstone, write a page a day. He then goes down the money management road, with some tired and less than sage cautions and advice.<br />This  was an entertaining and somewhat thought provoking piece from a recently trending artist, at least until the author got lost.<br />I enjoyed it $1.99's worth, but glad I didn't pay more!
B0036S4CTS|3.0|So, I was attracted to the story by its written style as described.  At the beginning, I thought Emma was shy and self-pity , and Dex was ignorant, flatly a playboy. They lived by completely different philosophy and world. But Emma's bravery gave them a chance to start. Typical story of a good girl fallen in love and save the dark guy. A story of growth and change.
B00992CF6W|5.0|He loves this game! Its his go to game, his other games have taken a back seat. I'm impressed with the ideas he comes up with of things to make. It's a game that he has to think about well playing unlike some others...
B003TTH4IU|5.0|As an aspiring medical student myself I enjoy watching very lifelike and severe medical situations coupled with the romantic drama that kept me hooked... well, without spoiling anything I believe this is a great medical drama.
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|UP was so entertaining, that I used it to distract Baby though a difficult feeding, but missed my Appointment.  I don't usually stomach mindless children's movies, don't have a TV on all the time - do steam - and rarely purchase instead of buy.  I really appreciated this unique story though.<br /><br />I bought UP with Instant Amazon, have the slowest connection DSL available, and use my iPad.  No issues with download / viewing.
B00DSY8D36|1.0|I couldn't get the get the product to work. I intend to return it. I tried to find help in the app and could not.  I tried to find help on google.  Which I am virtually ALWAYS successful at on any question I need answered (and I am a techy).  and although google did answer my question it gave me a simple easy solution to the problem. Don't use the app. Just transfer the file to kindle via email with convert in the subject line. Viola problem solved.<br /><br />So I don't know if the product is any good or not, but I can't get it to work.
B0030V0PEW|4.0|Fun to read, lots examples. I'm  working to add check lists on my daily practice. I also recomend the audio book.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|This is a beatuiful way to spend some time.  I cannot believe the talent displayed in this movie.  I really couldn't trust my own eyes in some of the segments.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great work of historical fiction by Ken Follett.  I wasn't interested in world history before. Now i can't get enough. The way he continues to weave the story of fictional families into authentic history is amazing.  Can't wait for more.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|It is a Great story, A movie you can watch over and over again!  I would recommend this movie to anyone
B005S9ELVC|5.0|Was really surprised by this movie.  Had no idea that the mob was in California until I saw this movie.  Acting was good, plot good and bought it because I want to see it again.  Both my husband and me enjoyed it.
B008GWP2GG|3.0|Another abduction movie fails to answer the real questions that make this genre so intriguing.  Apparently based on a true story Fire fails to take you to the edge of understanding and knowledge, which is the least of what we should expect from a tale of a man that survived and in fact remembers events of his abduction.  The aliens were rubbery and lifeless. The spacecraft looked more stone age than space age, hardly what you'd expect from an advanced species.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|Was so glad to see Arnold Schwarzenegger back on film.  Good role for him - he fits the part.  Enjoyed watching this flick - hope Arnold gets back in the swing of things and makes more movies again.  This one is a hit!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|boring at first but then you upgrade and its all up hill from there. lol<br />fun game. very addicting too.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|Not sure how to play yet but I am sure I can figure it out.  Instruction seem easy to follow.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it was a great game, made you think and I like games that do that. only problem is that you have to eventually buy<br />more floors. not paying real money for anything :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have never had a problem with this calculator and it has all the basic functions I was looking for. Perfect for someone looking to do simple math or balance a checkbook etc
B005MLOKXA|5.0|i love the picture quality and the show also.  great way to view tv .  I just wish I could download instead of streaming the free shows so I can watch on the train or in the park
1781162646|4.0|As usual, Mr. King writes extremely well. The story did not drift as far into the supernatural as many of his novels do but an enjoyable read.
B00BMEF6IO|4.0|Wasn't sure what to expect with Sempiternal. I wasn't a huge fan of BMTH's previous effort, \\"There is a Hell..\\" Majority of the songs sounded the same and blended too well. The song's off Sempiternal are well defined. Oli's vocals are crystal clear and have such passion. BMTH has kept their aggression, but have added more melody and clean vocals to the mix. I feel this is the right direction for the band. You need to add more levels to your music to keep it interesting. BMTH took time with this album and turned out a great batch of songs for their hardcore fans.<br /><br />As always, give the record a chance. For some it may take time to get use to. After a few listens the record becomes quite addicting.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I love to play the game but I do not enjoy the ad's I have to watch or click skip to get to the next game. I would also enjoy some additional options a list of my top ten scores and their times. But other then that I do like to play this game. It does not lock up or turn off like some games do.  Worth trying out for sure.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|I was interested in this book because I'd seen the clips for the t.v. show but had watched it.  I really liked the the book.  The characters are realistic, Walt Longmire is funny and likeable with a whole group of co-workers, friends, family who are also interesting.  It made me laugh out loud in a few places from Sheriff Longmire's use of country phrases and common sense.  The mystery was pretty good, although I wasn't happy with who the killer turned out to be; I will say no more about it so I don't give it away.  I'm reading the second one of Walt Longmire Mysteries called Death Without Company and I like that one to.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|...and he's a tough critic. Probably because of the other games he has played, he rapidly assimilated the how-to's of succeeding in this one. The great graphics and humorous characters add to the appeal, I suspect. And \\"free?\\" Who could beat that? Of course, there's probably paid upgrades and the like, but he hasn't noticed nor asked for those, so I'm happy with the game.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Use it on my Samsung Galaxy tablet when travelling....excellent.  Free book choice is hard to beat and prices of others is magnificent
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We love this show and can't get enough of it. It is very well written and acted. We can hardly wait for more, and this peaks our interest in history. The timeline follows real history very well and has given great insight into the concerns and happenings of those eras.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great game, can't think of any other game that I have enjoyed as much. I love these little guys so much.
B00C04H2VO|5.0|Movie and toys big hit loved the hand size figurines for play and collection Thanks it certainly keeps a childs imagination working
B002XZNHG4|4.0|Love any movie that Diane Keaton is , and it was fun seeing her so young.  The movie was a little wacky at times, but still entertaining.
0714834491|5.0|It's a highly interesting book; great quotes, great thoughts and insights. Good lay out. It's food for thought and the eyes. Alan Fletcher gives all he's got.
B000I9VOO4|5.0|Loved the book, and the movie is wonderful as well.  Even though it's been around for years, it is a classic and would suggest anyone of all ages to see.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great story.  Read the book before I saw the movie, the book was definately more exciting.  I missed many of the things from the book they skipped over in the movie.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Again this is a great classic movie that you never get tired of watching. I think I had ordered it in color but got it in black and white which to me is the best way to watch it as that was how it was made.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Handy way to start Netflix or stream musics using your phone or tablet. Pretty slick, especially if you already have and use any Android devices.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|The price was great and received it fast. Loved Travolta; Olivia Newton John; the singing and characters in the film and wanted to add it to our DVD collection. Highly recommend
B004ZNAXX2|2.0|All these discs and they didn't included the 1982 movie or any of the new and rerecorded songs done for the soundtrack (like \\"When The Tigers Broke Free (Pts 1 & 2)\\", \\"What Shall We Do Now?\\" and \\"Mother\\")?<br /><br />I don't get it.<br /><br />[DW]
0812979656|4.0|&#34;The God of Small Things&#34; takes a look at the nation of India seen through the eyes of a fractured Indian family. It is a great work; you feel the changes swirling through the nation as felt through the lives of these individuals.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Its great in a pinch tor when you need it. I use it all the time. saved me from hurting. myself a lot
0060555661|5.0|&#34;The Intelligent Investor&#34; is one of the best works for those looking to become educated about investing and personal finance. It's not 100% perfect, but the advise that this work dispenses is sound, reasonable, and logical, and it is a great starting point for anyone looking to dip their toe into the waters of financial investing.
B008FYZIVY|1.0|The scene with two homosexual men kissing was disgusting and not necessary to show.  We had our young granddaughters over to see it, thinking it would be good to watch.  What a mistake.  There is no good reason to elevate this type of abnormal behavior ...<br /><br />the acting and other scenes were good.  What a terrible shame to have this behavior entwined in a good series...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|works great does everything that i need to do really<br /> nice easy to use  comes in handy a lot i enjoy the larger keys
B000QJM8Z0|3.0|I loved the book, so funny and different from the movie.  I saw the movie first years ago but with the news of a new book coming out I thought I should read the book.<br /><br />I typically read the books before seeing the movie as the books are usually better and if i read the book after seeing the movie I end up putting the book down to view the movie.  Not in this case the book was different enough from the movie that I wanted to see what changes there were.<br /><br />Now I need to read the second then the third!!
B005GIS1WA|5.0|excellent animation combined with a great music score and really good characterizations make this a great film for adults to share with children....neither will be bored and there are laughs for both
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing I play it all the time!I would definitely recommend it<br />Me and my whole family play it every day
0553583182|3.0|I bought the revised and expanded version by Ian. Please beware of buying this version because it's not a good version.<br /><br />I suggest reading all of the reviews for all the different books that have revisions for the same book FIRST before purchasing.<br /><br />A reviewer on Amazon states that ISBN 978-0-7352-0168-2 or ISBN 978-0-7352-0431-7 are the closest version to Joseph Murphy's book The Power Of Your Subconscious Mind that people should buy.<br /><br />I'm going to buy the suggested version ISBN 978-0-7352-0168-2 or ISBN 978-0-7352-0431-7 and keep my fingers crossed that it's a more thorough book.  I haven't touched the revised and expanded version by Joseph Murphy/Ian Wallace since I bought it in 2011. What a waste of money.<br /><br />You can buy the revised and expanded by Ian Wallace but it's not something I would recommend.
B008MX7Z32|3.0|Honestly, I love the light outputs. All four brightnesses have their uses and I like the option instead of squinting from risk of blindness. What made me so mad, was when I took it out of the box, the loop connecting the white at the bottom platform was cracked, so it couldn't hold itself up. I attempted supergluing it together, but that hardly helped. I would be much more impressed if I didn't receive a broken item
B0090SI582|4.0|The Wolverine (2013)<br /><br />*************************<br /><br />What is it about Wolverine movies that makes writers and directors want to overcomplicate them, or fiddle with pulp perfection? Here's how you make a Wolverine movie:<br /><br />1. Have Wolverine act gruff.<br />2. Have Wolverine hand-stab the crap out of a bunch of bad guys.<br />3. Don't change characters who don't need to be changed, and don't add a bunch of unnecessary characters from other comics who don't have a whole lot to do with Wolverine.<br /><br />That's it!! How hard is that, really? And yet this is the second time that the seemingly simple task of making a good Wolverine has been mucked up by bad writing and unnecessary flourishes. In this instance, the failure is even more painful because, for the first 3/4ths of its running time, The Wolverine is a terrific little action movie. Hugh Jackman has never been better in the role, nailing once and for all that tricky mix between soulfulness and savagery that makes Logan who he is. He wasn't overplaying the tough guy, nor was he the prone-to-tears Wolvie that has been seen in other films in the X franchise. The action was pretty brutal and, I think, pushed the PG-13 rating to its limit. The performers were all game and capable actors. What I really like about The Wolverine is the lack of bombast found in the other X-Men films. This film is lean, quiet in parts. Some of its scenes (particularly the ones where Mariko and Logan simply talk like two human beings might) wouldn't be out of place in a typical arthouse movie. And then, of course, the final 20 minutes throws all of that hard work right out the window.<br /><br />Ohhhh, that ending. It seems like filmmakers who tackle a Wolverine film just can't manage to stick the landing. The script basically falls off a cliff and lands back in X-Men Origins: Wolverine territory; what was a pretty good, character-driven action movie becomes a mishmash of superhero noise and mayhem, misused characters (not quite as bad as Deadpool in the Origins movie, but pretty damn bad) and plot developments that make not a lick of sense.<br /><br />Now for those who aren't aware, the main elements of The Wolverine's story were loosely based on the legendary 1982 miniseries by Chris Claremont & Frank Miller. It's a nearly perfect, self-contained story about Wolverine taking on the Yakuza in Japan to save the woman he loves and his journey of self-discovery along the way, among other things. I was thrilled when I first heard they were adapting the story for this sequel. When I went to see this movie, I knew the story would not be presented unaltered, and while that was initially disappointing, I was won over and I began to appreciate the movie for what it was, rather than what it wasn't, which is rare for me as a comic book fan who's seen many a faithless film adaptation. As the final reel started to roll, though, The Wolverine took all of that goodwill and burned it like a guy lighting a cheap stogie with a $50 bill. That's the kind of whiplash that this movie gave me.<br /><br />Here's my final word on The Wolverine: watch the first 3/4ths, then just pretend Logan saved the day right then and there after defeating ninjas in the snowy village. Then, fast forward to the end scene between Logan and Mariko--no idiotic final fight required. (Definitely stay for the post-credits scene!) Otherwise, you may find yourself regretting your decision to get so invested in what is, until that last fatal stumble, a nearly-great movie.<br /><br />3.5 stars out of 5, rounded up to 4 stars.<br /><br />********************<br /><br />The Wolverine<br /><br />Starring: Hugh Jackman<br />Directed by: James Mangold<br />Rated: PG-13<br />Release Year: 2013
B00AFEY354|5.0|It arrived promptly and was well packaged. I got mine slightly used, so it still has the rental stickers on it, which makes me laugh a little.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I really enjoy match 3 games..especially if there's a purpose to the game play. This is one of the better ones out there. It's challenging enough so you won't get bored and it gives you something to complete. The graphics and sound are relaxing, so before you know it...hours have passed.
B005FITIDC|5.0|This movie shows how the Lord works in people's live.  My husband and myself watched it twice in two days.<br />Excellent movie!!!!! Must see!!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a good read.  Opens your eyes to how people love and are motivated to return love. Must have!
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|If you're an opera lover (which I am), you'll love this film.  If you don't know anything about opera, I think it's still enjoyable,but there are lots of references you may miss.  Great performances by a truly stellar cast.
B00E38KGF4|5.0|Have used bit defender for years never had a problem with their service and would recommend to everyone that this is the perfect app to keep you safe for the trully paranoid like myself because I don 't trust the way the government uses social media so I like to be as safe as I can on the Internet.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I love this game. Brings back memories. I like the avatars and the graphics too! I like the scratch off option for more tokens as well.
B00E1LT41K|4.0|I learned all about this time from a great podcast called RexFactor. It's on iTunes. If you like this series enough to get the DVDs, you will love RexFactor!
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This game is pretty tough, but once you build up a strategy it's great. It's a tower defense game with 4 types of towers, and specific places you can put towers in. There are tons of different upgrades for each tower as well. It's definitely worth the money.
B001O4XWJM|4.0|This is a western true to the genre personified by &#34;True Grit&#34; and a host of John Wayne originals.<br />No reinterpretations of how best to tell the story here!
B009POHHRG|5.0|Provides a great Batgirl and Joker origin story, along with perfect Joker dialogue and a dynamic interaction with the Bat himself.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I really loved this book. It was so beautifully written. The descriptions were rich, and I enjoyed discovering how each of the many characters lives intertwined.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|The movie had a nice dose of realism countered by a hopeful love story. There was laughing, crying, failures and triumph.
B000XUBFE2|2.0|I found the meandering style of this book to be a bit challenging. I had heard so many great things about this book (it seems to be so many peoples' favorite book ever!) that I felt I had to continue. I thought the narrator was interesting, clever even, but instead of being excited by the constant backtracking, I kept waiting for the inevitable to happen.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game has everything to keep your mind busy and it doesn't drain your battery very fast either. I love this game because it take the minions and make them even funnier and the game doesn't have lives!!!!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Just like his other books, I couldnt put this book down.  His stories are very mesmerizing and detailed.  more please
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  This was a very different approach to telling a story.  The author was great at drawing you in....
B009I2UH2W|1.0|my charger broke just 3 weeks after I received it!! I scould not believe it and was really dissappointed with this product!
B008J05EL8|1.0|DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IT DOES NOT WORK.  TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.  THERE IS NO REFUND PROCESS AVAILABLE.  THIS IS JUNK
B00CFA222M|4.0|{3.5 stars}<br /><br />JACK the GIANT SLAYER is a nice flight of the imagination and exercise in fairly mindless--though far from stupid--entertainment. The film has a Disney-like flavor, and though it makes only a half-hearted attempt to convey the medieval setting, the cinematography is very fine. Good performances by Hoult, Tomlinson, and McGregor.<br /><br />The story may be missing a piece or two, and the modern day ending is a bit tacked-on. There's an interesting mythos here, but its underdevelopment is  dissatisfying. Nevertheless, it's clear from the beginning that this is not a film to take too seriously: Simply fun to watch for children of all ages.
B00632HWOG|5.0|What a pleasure to be able to send e mails without going to each address over and over. This app is full of all the same features of my pc, wonderful!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great device. Possibilities are endless. The chromecast was easy to set up and now I get all my favorite digital media on my TV.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|In Subway Suffers you never run out of things to buy or do. I think my favorite part is with each new place there is a new person
B008YKGQR4|1.0|What a mess.  I just went to the web and used the same version I use on my laptop.  Much happier.
B00AEFYS8G|4.0|I like western movies and I did enjoy this older movie.<br />It had great actors and good story line that was believable.
B00123LIPK|1.0|I cannot believe how True Blue (her best song) was left off this with so many BAD songs here.  Madonna ia not that good to begin with and they really messed this one up with bad remixes and a bad song selection.  Avoid!
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|This movie is action packed like the other movies of this series.<br />Some of the scenes are unrealist but enjoyable to watch.
B004YOEFG8|3.0|This was a pretty good documentary, but not really dynamic in its 3d effects. I was a little disappointed in that. But it did a great job of documenting the repair procedure.
B00D23K0MU|5.0|Have been waiting for Maysa to drop a new album. Just love her silky jazzy voice on her projects.Any body that loves Jazz and R&B would love to here her sing.
1575666286|5.0|A GREAT book!  I have turned several people on to this book.  If you're thinking of ordering it... I highly recommend it.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|really nice, so easy and convinient because you have everything in your Television. My daughter never stop watching the movie for those 3 days hahaha!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This is so well written.  I can't wait for season 4- I think Bates is hiding something - any bets?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's very fun and its free. The graphics for this can is very clean and I have not bumped in to any problems with the game yet.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I remember Oregon Trail as a kid, even though this isn't the same, it's still fun. The theme is what makes it fun~
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This book was good but,  a little drawn out.  The plot was not as good as the first. The ending screwed the readers.  A trilogy means three!!! not four and definetly not five.  If it was about the money I would have paid extra to read the ending to Eva and Gideon's story whether a happy one or not.  But now that this saga will continue I am truly disappointed.  Ms. Day is a lovely author but her publishing company is leading her down the wrong path.  I would truly suggest to her to stay true to her writing style and focus on content and plot not drawn out sagas and unnecessary dramas.
B003U4ZQUM|4.0|Compared to the previous seasons I found this one a little more mysterious. What was the true reason for the return to the island? How did Jacob impact each decision to return those who were dead set against returning? And what's up with John Locke?  See if you can figure that out!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Thought it was a great read. Amazing to see some of the futuristic concepts (that were not around when the book was written) an everyday part of our current lives.  IE, internet, tablets, e-file textbooks, email, computerized warfare.  I've never been a huge fan if Sci-fi, but as this was not about the Sci-fi, IE the Sci-fi was the side story, I was able to become fully immersed in Ender's story and journey.  Could not put the book down!!  Highly recommended!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved it very addictive just too short, can't wait to play the next addition. Loved the creepy voices like ghosts.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|my favorite show! Cannot wait for season four!!  The actors are great and so is the story line. Love it!
B00AHXDECG|5.0|one of the best Artist since I seen Prince and Michael Jackson. just saw him live, had  to get this!!!! great music
B00AEFXLBQ|5.0|Breakfast At Tiffany's is an iconic American film. It revealed the changing mores of the nation as the fifties became the sixties. This is a story about a &#34;good girl&#34; who happens to be a hooker.
B007HO392S|5.0|This CD has some of Carrie's best songs. Blown Away and 2 Black Cadillacs are my favorite songs.Now I have them on my phone and in my car.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|The first time I started reading this book it bored me like no other book, but then a month ago I started reading it again and it caught me off guard. This time I paid attention to all the details and names and everything, and today I think it is one of my favorite books. Already started with the second one.
B008B11R1Q|5.0|I love the XX. Jamie xx's beats make your heart thump and the vocals of the other two are just amazing. What talent! i saw them live and just adored them. Highly reccommend this. Bass is heavy too so don't turn it up too loud in the car. Its heavy but sounds good.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Reminds me of the song \\"don't worry, be happy.\\"  Maybe over simplified, but it's what I understand this author means to convey.<br />Ms Moorjani's experience is beyond my comprehension, but I believe she experienced a realm that we can't imagine as mere mortals.  I look at life and death differently now.I hope to change my perspective of myself and others and learn to truly love life.<br />Read this book,
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|Great first book in a series! I love the humor and the family bond between all the characters. good love story!
B00821OX98|5.0|Well written and directed, Falling Skies is great for both sci-fi and post apocolypse fans. Even those who don't care much for alien stories should give this a shot. It had romance, action, suspense, betrayal, revenge, victory, and defeat. My only hope is the creators don't over extend the series.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Love reading this in between work, kids , and being a wife. Takes my mind off of the everyday life.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|The best so much fun better than watching dogs poop or cats mate even better than waiting for birds to fall out of the sky dead  you must get this app it will make you stop picking your nose and eating it
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This app is good for it being free! I enjoy that it keeps me thinking! It is very addicting in a good way!
B008D19WBQ|5.0|Great quality.  Wonderful value. Would recommend to a friend.  This product gets two thumbs up.  Absolutely live it.  Definitely an A+!!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Amazing just what I was looking for.My cousin has it on the iPad and its fun I recommend it to everyone.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The big buttons and large screen make this very easy to use. It also shows your last calculation helping o keep track of long lists of numbers.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Good movie, better story line and a little more together than the first movie. More action than in the Sherlock Holmes novels and short stories but good none the less.
B00DF0POXA|1.0|This is nothing more than a polished turd. Horrible lyrics, awful beats and obviously thrown together at the last minute.
B000P0J06K|5.0|The original was and always will be the best, they keep remaking Batman but as far as I'm concerned Michael Keaton and Jack Nichols as the Joker set the standard they keep trying to re-invent.

B008JFUN50|3.0|I liked Blomkamp's \\"District 9\\" a lot and couldn't wait to see this. Turns out, I could have.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. 2154's Earth has pretty much been turned into an ashtray, and all the the elite have moved to Elysium, an orbiting space station. Max (Matt Damon) is a parolee working a crap job in a factory. Lax safety regulations cause him to take a massive dose of radiation. He has five days to worm his way to Elysium to get cured. The job he pulls to do so puts data directly into his brain pan that is meant to stage a coup on their president by Delacourt (Jodie Foster) the secretary. It's all out mayhem.<br /><br />There is so much to love here. The earth scenes are much like what viewers saw in \\"District 9\\" with the dust, heat, grit and poverty. These opening scenes are great in depicting the situation. Damon delivers some great dialogue like he was born for it. The factory scenes are easily as good. You feel as though you are there with him. Then things get dicey. Some of the plot points are just plain stupid, inconsistent and unbelievable. Not to spoil but how is it the first rogue ships are set upon immediately when entering Elysium while Spider's ship lands unmolested, even when the heat has been turned up to eleven? I could go on but why bother. Just let it be said that some things happen that will leave you shaking your head.<br /><br />I'm not throwing the baby out with the bathwater. This is well worth seeing, just don't expect a better effort than was \\"District 9.\\" I root for Blomkamp. I think he's a heck of a director. He just isn't a great writer. Had the studio assigned him a script doctor or just someone to write with this would have been an outstanding effort.

B00E1LR2B4|5.0|I was totally unaware of this movie until a vocalist friend of mine asked me if I wanted to see it.  Some friends in her all female singing group had seen it and raved about it.  So, on an impulse I went to see it.<br /><br />Behind every great star is a great singing talent backing them up.  Sting, Rolling Stones, George Harrison, Lynyrd Skynrd, Luther Vandross, Michael Jackson, Stevie wonder.<br /><br />Twenty feet tells the story of backup singers who we are impressed by but have not necessarily given much thought to their story.  However to see this movie is to become of aware of their story, their talent, and their struggles.<br /><br />Thematically, it visits  the theme explored in Standing in the Shadows of Motown, which explored the musician talent behind all the great Motown hits. Most of the great hits of Motown featured almost the exact same musicians creating the distinctive Motown sound, and that movie explored their story.<br /><br />Although I loved that movie which I highly recommend I loved this one more, because it explores the more personal dimension of the singer.  We get inside the story of these women singers and learn of their trials and tribulations, and as the title suggests the closeness to fame and the elusive quality of fame itself. These ladies are undoubtedly very talented, and I pulled out a pen and started writing down their names as I watched the movie so that I could explore more of their work later.<br /><br />Most of the great artists do use backup singers, and there is no doubt that the harmonies and counter-melodies they contribute add a huge dimension to the artists performance, and to our experience as a listener.<br /><br />Major artists such as Sting, Mick Jagger, Bruce Springsteen and Stevie Wonder contribute their insights, and their stories, and we also get to see some Michael Jackson footage, and the backup singer on the verge of becoming famous until you know what.. happened.<br /><br />One particular highlight for me was the story of the recording of Gimme Shelter with the Rolling Stones.  I will never think of that song the same way again.<br /><br />Another was the harrowing story of Darlene Love and her experiences with Phil Spector.  While his brilliance as a producer is undoubted his treatment of her was horrible.<br /><br />I was previously unaware that before the era of Milli Vanilli, some well known female singing acts performed in concert lip synching to vocals provided by studio backup singer in concert, although we all know about Audrey Hepburn and My Fair Lady I think.<br /><br />Similarly a story of a woman backup singer who finally gets her own recording contract, and records a hit song.  However the song is put out under the name of a different artist and gets to number one using her vocals.<br /><br />Most movies when released make the biggest money on the opening weekend, and often trail off spectacularly losing as much as much as 50% the following week, and often fizzle or disappear after a few weeks.  Twenty feet made on a budget of approximately $1 million grossed $54,000 on it's opening weekend  in June on 3 screens.  An impressive number per screen on a limited release.  One month later it grosses<br />$370,000, and $390,000 on back to back weekend, and in August it's still going strong having grossed over $3,000,000.  It has also won several awards including the San Francisco International Film Festival audience award.<br /><br />I think we all love to root for the underdog, if you're like me as you watch this movie, you may wonder why isn't this particular woman a superstar.  Some of them very definitely deserve to be.<br /><br />Some names to remember and explore: Ciandra Lennear, Merry Clayton,  Darlene Love, Lisa Fischer, and Judith Hill.<br /><br />We enjoyed it.  It got a round of applause at the end.  I would not be the least bit surprised if this was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary.<br /><br />I think you will love it, and I hopethis was helpful.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Intriguing, deep, well written.  A good use of three narrators to tell the story.  Even if you guess the secret ( which isn't revealed until half through the book ) you still can not stop reading and the ending is both deep and quietly unexpected.
140006922X|5.0|Everyone seems to have to have a chance at doing their interpretation of the life of Jesus. The Protestant Reformation still at work. What especially prompted me to read this - in fact to know it was published, was the highly ridiculous interview on Fox News where Reza explained his professional interests to a puzzled correspondent that could not fathom why someone who was Islamic would be interested in Jesus. She totally missed the connection between his having a PhD in Religious Studies along with his Koine Greek fluency and over twenty years of research including 1,000 books. Amusing. It is also interesting that one of the plugs for the book on the back of the jacket is by Jon Meacham whose book Thomas Jefferson I recently read. But despite my appreciation of RA's earlier book No God but God and enjoying his presentation here in Anchorage years ago, this book seems more a summary of many points I have already read in some of those 1,000 books. I do like the direct points RA makes and his recap of the current scholarship on Jesus and his times is an excellent summary that puts things nicely together. His approach is one that would fit well with the themes of folks like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris. A main emphasis is pointing out the many other Messiahs the Romans had to deal with before and after the life of Jesus which places him pretty precisely among his peers. This gives RA an opportunity to hypothesize on what particular motivations a Zealot would have and how being from Galilee would have predisposed him to taking the positions he did. It seems to me I have heard better explanations of the Coin of Tribute exchange which would lead to a different stress on much that is dogmatic here. It is also clear that RA takes a particular line of argument as clearly closer to the historical fact than is agreed upon by everyone engaged in this quest, but RA acknowledges that. Hence, my feeling that everyone wants to get in on the opportunity to take their position on this. But I am glad RA has done so. Good job. One surprise for me was no mention of one author I really found inspiring years ago and that is Hyam Maccoby who died in 2004. His book Revolution in Judea seems like part one of RA's book and Haym's Paul and The Invention of Christianity seems like part two.his. But I am glad RA has done so. Good job.

B0086700CM|3.0|Graphics are a bit sketchy, sometimes it's hard to tell what you are looking at. Maybe because I started with Temple Run 2 it spoiled me for this version.
0812550706|1.0|Books give an insight into the mind of the author. The hero in Ender's Game is an extremely young boy who is placed in an intense military training program within a future society. The boy is portrayed with adult intellect and language - actually a super intellect. Well, what's the big deal? It appears that his super intellect is good enough reason to write about a child engaging in brutal violence, repeated nudity and profanity. It gave me the creeps that someone would entertain these thoughts about a child, put them on paper (even though it's a sci-fi novel) and his editors had no problem with it. There should have been an adult in the room that exclaimed, \\"You can't talk about a six year old like that! That's sick!\\" Lastly, the ending of the book just went off the chart in weirdness....My two cents.
B004Q3UL56|3.0|Good acting although a bit too long. Typical love story of boy meets girl, breaks up, gets back together, happy every after. bla bla bla.
B008MVPAB8|4.0|The classic Crocs were in my mind for a long time and finally I have them. They are perfect for summertime and travel. I used them on an intercontinental flight and felt great.<br />The lack of 1/2 sizes is a bit inconvenient. I had to try the shoes in the store to find out about the good size for me and then, I ordered them from Amazon.<br />Overall I am very satisfied.
B009AMAGQM|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />Based on the novel by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl, \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" is a piece of Southern-fried gothic filtered through a modern sensibility. Lena Duchannes  is a mysterious teenage girl whose sudden arrival in a small South Carolina town sparks suspicion, concern and outrage among its highly conservative citizens - all but fellow high-schooler Ethan Wate, that is, who finds her a refreshing and fascinating addition to the provincial community he calls home.  An avid reader of Kurt Vonnegut, Ethan lives for the day when he'll be able to flee this lil' ole backwater town and experience what life has to offer in the great world just beyond its borders. What he doesn't count on is that excitement, in the form of Lena, will find its way into his own backyard.<br /><br />Director Richard Lagravenese's potpourri of a screenplay - replete with witches, sirens, magic spells, family secrets, dysfunctional relatives and Civil War reenactments - is all done in a spirit of lively good fun, filled with wit, warmth and wisdom about young love. Alden Ehrenreich and Alice Englert are charming as the offbeat star-crossed lovers, but it's when a group of old pros - Jeremy Irons, Viola Davis, Emma Thompson, Emmy Rossum, Eileen Atkins, Margo Martindale - takes the stage that the real fun begins (and a young pro like Emmy Rossum is a delight as well).<br /><br />Due most likely to budgetary constraints, the special effects occasionally come off as a trifle sub-par by Hollywood standards, and there is a whiff of the CW about the whole  project from time to time (there`s an undeniable scent of \\"The Vampire Diaries\\" and even of HBO`s \\"True Blood\\" here). There are also some lapses in continuity and logic, such as the fact that the story begins at the start of the school year, yet, in a few days' time, we've somehow already arrived at Christmas vacation (maybe it`s that old witchcraft stuff again). And one doubts that even in a deep-in-the-heart-of-Dixie state like South Carolina, the weather would be quite this warm and the landscape quite this lush in the middle of December.<br /><br />Still, flaws aside, \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" should more than satisfy its target audience of swooning tweens.South Carolina, the weather would be quite this warm and the landscape quite this lush in the middle of December.<br /><br />Still, flaws aside, \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" should more than satisfy its target audience of swooning tweens.
B000FC1JAI|5.0|Yes, a great read, one which I'll be reading again and again.  I wish I'd read it earlier in life!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Still the best of the Temple Run games. Never have problems with this game. Instructions would be nice. Like it.
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|As many other people have said, getting the batteries into this unit is not an easy task.  I could not get the battery pack to fit at all.  One reviewer suggested a work around for the ill fitting battery pack.  My response to him/her is that this should work straight out of the box.  I shouldn't have to wrestle with it to make it work.<br /><br />So, great concept executed poorly.  And back to amazon it goes.
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|I would have rated this book less highly if it had not been the authors true story.  While it told a wonderful - almost incredible - story worth learning, the prose was sometimes tortured and the attribution of all the wisdom in the world to certain characters was often just too extreme.  However, knowing that these were not made up characters, but real people in the authors life and understanding that he lived the events gave perspective to the sometimes laborious tale.  Once I was half way through I was thoroughly hooked and am glad I persevered through my initial doubt to find the beautiful truths of the India which the author so clearly loved and wished to share in magnificent detail.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I believe this book is the best book I have ever read. I cried tears of joy at the end. You  must read the epilogue to understand this book and the entire series.  You are the greatest author in all of history Suzanne Collins
B00DYTKKGI|3.0|Very simple game. Can't do much with it without spending money to upgrade. Got bored with it pretty quickly and I'm not a great gamer by the any means.
B000HKYA1I|5.0|This is a wonderfully told and acted story. The characters are 3 dimensional and they pull you in from the first moment on the screen. The soundtrack changed my music experience forever. I discovered Gogl Bordello through this movie, and that changed everything. it was all Illuminated after that. I have seen this movie 10 times, and it is always a wonderful surprise.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Martin has taken a great story and is ruining the series for money. He refuses to bring any story to a conclusion and has forced it to become a trite soap opera.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing the next book.<br /><br />George W. Corrales, NM
B008JFUPK8|5.0|First off let me just say that i am biased, I loved the Superman character since I was a child, I remember seeing the original Christopher Reeve movies with my dad some 35 years ago, with that said this movie did not disappoint, plenty off things to nitpick about if you wanted to but overall a great movie, looking forward to the sequel!<br /><br />P.S I really don't know what movie the critics watched, I don't think most of them had an understanding of the character at all...
0071373586|2.0|This book reads like a quick \\"101\\" on marketing/advertising key points. It's an entry level book and was probably helpful at the time of publishing, but now very outdated, and the author does not have applicable takeways (i.e. bulletpoint summaries etc) that could have been more helpful.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-lot of classic case studies<br />-good advice about picking a name and basic positioning facts<br />-easy to breeze thru<br />-a quick \\"101\\" on marketing/advertising key points.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-fails to give consistent advice (author states \\"less is more\\". then \\"more is less\\", and then says line-extensions are bad, then turns around and says line extensions can be successful)<br />-does not back up research; (i.e. attributes a 56% increase of sales due to advertising --this is one part but there are other factors --these numbers come out of nowhere)<br />-outdated case studies (american airlines is supposed to be super successful)<br />-does not enter digital realm of online/internet.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|always good to return to the source when a  movie comes out, so you can see how true it was to the original
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Amazing story of a true American hero.  A must read for any patriot.  God bless America.<br />  God bless our troops!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This was just challenging enough for the casual player but interesting enough for more experienced players.  Liked the graphics.  Not mind bending but fun enough.
B00701QVVY|5.0|Can you go wrong with Over Kill, I don't think so. Looking forward to seeing this album in concert. Buy it.
B009GX69RK|5.0|First off, the level of chemistry between the cast members is something you don't see very often. It makes the show flow smoothly and effortlessly and keeps viewers engaged. Zooey Deschanel, and the rest of the gang, are hugely talented and make their characters believable and very personable, which is not an easy feat on a sitcom.<br /><br />Secondly, the writing is brilliant. The writers have taken a somewhat realistic approach to the plot which makes it that much more fun to watch. The story lines are great and the humor is 'laugh outloud' funny, which makes it an incredibly addicting show.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is the best show to come along in a very very long time. I can't wait for Season 3!
B000W453KQ|5.0|The Way We Were is a Love Story of the times in America when things changed for women and men in our Country and some still do not realize the changes and what they are for women.  Men receive much higher wages for their degrees, while women receive much lower wages and this woman here intends to change that for women.  We are going to speak up and out at the woman, who sits there and holds their tong rather than speak up and let their voice be heard by others, by using Critical Thinking to educate and move our country forward to a New Age of Equality for one and all.<br /><br />This story says that in every word spoken by Barbara Streisand, as our Katie and Robert Redford, as our Hubble.  They are and were perfect for the roles of Katie and Hubble and this movie will certainly go down in our History, as the Love Story of all Love Stories.<br /><br />Make sure to watch this wonderful movie of our times, then and now.  Below is the Link for \\"The Way We Were\\"...<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000W453KQ B000W453KQ]]
1118273052|5.0|My Review will not add much more than what other reviews have already said.<br />I will say this though, many of the traders and coaches profiled in this book have written books or courses of their own. I have studied many of these materials and found them very enlightening.<br /><br />Overall this is a true classic, one of the best books
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app it is amazing. Despicable me 2 is a great movie I think a game is a great way to summon it yup p
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Wow, this was intriguing and interesting. I was so involved in the story I had trouble putting it down, even for everyday obligations. My niece kept telling me I needed to read this book. Finally, I did. Wish I had listened the first time she told me!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|After purchasing and watching Seasons 1 and 2 I wanted to see Season 3.  After just watching episode 1 I can't wait to continue to watch the rest of the episodes.  Excellent series.
0525478817|5.0|One of the best and saddest novels i have ever read, this book is full of emotions and i couldnt be happier that i read it... i am telling all my friends and family to pick it up, becasue once you do you will not be able to put it down... enjoy and have lots of tissues ready near by... i may probably read it again one day, because you fall in love with the characters from the very begining.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|This is officially my favorite book. Her strive to become balanced between two worlds of spirit and material were portrayed clearly, concisely and artistically. She became a dear friend to me because I felt like I could relate to her on so many levels and what she wrote about was the advice given to help grow and expand. Not only is her story just so divine, her style of writing is vivid and just so artistic. Such a zen book, organized in such a sacred way and it all fit so perfectly... So beautiful. So inspiring. I highly recommend... This will spiral you in to a world so different from the west and the norm, it will influence every soul to expand and explore.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use, no trouble pressing the numbers. 100% recommended for anyone who needs a fast and easy answer!!!!!!I really liked it
B000J103PC|5.0|She loves this movie.  Getting her this ended many, many arguments and caused her to love me like a woman should love a man!  Oh, and it was so hot, too!  If you want your special lady friend to show you a good time or two, get her this movie!  You will not be disappointed!

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I was a little apprehensive at first but once I got past the first chapter I was drawn in. I can't wait to read more of the series.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|The different puzzles made this game a lot of fun.  Sometimes it was a bit frustrating when the hint was barely even a hint.  But, overall, I really enjoyed it.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|...if Angry Birds took place in the Star Wars universe.  But if Angry Birds took place in the Star Wars universe, Geroge Lucas would keep releasing special edition after special edition of this game, making it nearly unplayable, as he takes a giant dump on everything you once held dear during your childhood.  Thanks for screwing up this once great game too, George!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game is so addictive! I may require a twelve step program when I am done. Can't wait to get more levels.
B0060CRM6M|5.0|My Daughter watches the movie all the time and she loves Chicken Little. I could recommend my friends kids to buy the movie.
B00AEBB8NI|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  Leonardo was excellent.  I love a surprise ending.  Received this movie very timely.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I can never get enough Sam and Dean.  I love the series and will  continue to watch Supernatrual as long as it is on tv,
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I am two-thirds of the way through watching the original Star Trek series, and enjoying every minute.  One of the things that astonishes me is the relevance and excellence of the scripts.  Also, how similar Gene Roddenberry was to Rod Serling in setting controversial topics in another world (or universe) in order to say what he wanted to say. It is also interesting to see the influence of Rod Serling and Gene Roddenberry in the more recent Sci-Fi television series (just cancelled), FRINGE.  What I love about all three in the lack of moral equivalency.  Good is good.  Bad is bad.  And never the twain shall meet.<br /><br />Although the entire cast is terrific, there is no question that William Shatner's and Leonard Nemoy's intensity and brillirant acting gave the show its vitality and made it such a phenomenon.  The series appears to be beautifully restored.  And from Season Two on, the intros have been pepped up with a new recording of the theme and restoration of Captain Kirk's original voiceover.  Interviews with former cast memebers are fun.  Watching this is sheer joy.  Worth every cent.
B004LROUW2|3.0|My mom kept bugging me to read this because she was reading the Korean translation and loving it. I have mixed feelings about this one. There were parts that I really liked, some interesting characters, and I felt compelled to keep reading to find out what happened. But there were a lot of negatives. I don't know if it's Murakami's writing style or simply a bad translation, but I felt like the dialogue was very awkward most of the time, especially in the first two books and in any conversation between Aomame and Ayumi. (I heard that the Korean translation is better than the English one for this book, so that might explain why my mom liked it better than I did.) And, as others have mentioned, there's a lot of repetition. How many times do we have to hear about Aomame's small and uneven breasts and Ushikawa's ugliness? I love detailed writing but I don't need to read the same things over and over again. There were also a lot of gratuitous and poorly written sex scenes. And the most frustrating aspect was that there were so many questions left unanswered. I felt like this could've used some heavy handed good editing. This was my first Murakami book so I'll give one of his older books a try at some point and hope for something a bit better.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I am really enjoying this game!!  I usually don't play games, but I decided to give this one a try and I love it.  Kudos.

I spent a good amount of my honeymoon playing this because I just wanted to keep improving and getting farther into the dungeons!<br /><br />10000000 is definitely worth the price.  I highly recommend this to puzzle, rpg, and dungeon crawling seekers alike.  I could play this for hours, and you will, too!

B00DJFIMW6|3.0|My 6-year-old loved this game. One was saving up his bananas to buy new minions. Then the game &#34;upgraded&#34; so it cost medals instead of bananas to get new characters. Just about the only way for him to get enough medals is to actually buy them with real money. Earning the bananas is almost pointless now. It totally took the fun out of the game for him. We are very disappointed. The only  reason I give it 3 stars is because it was fun before the upgrade.

Of course, there must have been some mix-up with the shipping, as the original order showed up 1 week later with no explanation. I of course sent it back to Amazon but they put a lot of good faith in me my sending the new one no questions asked. Customer service like that is how you guarantee customers for life.<br /><br />The processor itself performs as expected, is sturdily packaged, and comes with a stock heat sink. Installation was not an issue and so far it hasn't given me any problems.

B009XIXVU6|3.0|I chose this book because of the previous book for the same author. I loved them. But this book is not as good as the others. The author charactors were mentioned in the first third of the book than at the end of the story. Most of the charactors did not any sense to be there. so i found boring.
B008220BP2|5.0|Was kind of hesitant to see this movie at first because I thought it was going to be like twilight which is another franchise that I'm not a big fan of. I listened to a good friend of mine who described it to me and to my surprise it was nothing like twilight. It's a new and original zombie comedy with charming humor. This film easily became one of my favorites for 2013.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Awesome game. I like it a whole lot for real man, i mean super real neat for real boy. I do like it a
B001AMNL2Q|4.0|One of the best moments is Modine trying to explain his peace pin and the &#34;duality-of-man&#34; thing to the vapid colonel. It shows the &#34;Fubar&#34; nature of war -- when people don't think or when they think too much. Great soundtrack as well.<br /><br />Vincent D'Onofrio is amazing as Pvt. Lawrence. He gained 70 lbs for the role, bringing his weight to 280 lbs, which is the record for most weight gained by an actor for a movie, surpassing Robert De Niro's gain of 60 lb (27 kg) for Raging Bull.  You can't help but empathize with Lawrence.

B00ACP3OOM|3.0|I have used Finis SwimP3's since generation 1.<br /><br />I loved my first generation product (blue and white).  No glitches at all.  Songs loaded up very quickly and hassle free.  Yes, it had limited capacity, but I was only swimming for an hour at a time, so didn't really need that much space.  When those finally died, Finis was on the second generation of the product (yellow and black).  This one had firmware issues out of the gate and was not readable by a mac.  When I got the new firmware onto the set, these too worked very well.  Alas, these too died about three weeks ago.  Which brings me to the Neptune System.<br /><br />Pros:<br />(1) Songs loaded up like a charm.  Copied over mp3 files from my iTunes library and they played beautifully.<br />(2) Sounds better than the old SwimP3.  If you are old enough and remember listening to music on an AM station and then listened to music on an FM station, that is the sound improvement you are looking at when you move from SwimP3s to Neptunes.<br /><br />Cons:<br />(1) Design.  The ear pieces have clips that go from bottom up not from top down.  Imagine using a clothes pin and pinching from above (SwimP3) vs pinching from below (Neptune).  For me this is less sturdy than the top down approach.<br />(2) Design (2).  The back of the head unit is bulky.  It is a top down clip, but the back of the head unit is quite large especially if you wear a swim cap and wear the cap over your goggles.  It's only a centimeter thick, but that extra centimeter makes your cap just that much tighter.<br />(3) Song Display.  Do you really need to see the song title and artist displayed while the song is playing?  If you are like me, you're swimming when the songs are playing and the unit is behind your head where you can't even read what song is playing.  In my case, its even below my swim cap so I really can't see it.<br />(4) Reliability.  This is the HUGE con.  My Neptune is dead.  My Neptune was delivered on 8/1.  I didn't start usingit until 8/4.  It wouldn't play any songs this morning 8/12.  In total, it lasted 6 workouts (11 miles).  I don't believe it is actually waterproof.  I can see a water bubble under the screen.  The pool I swim in is only 6 ft deep (max), so I couldn't have exceeded the depth.<br /><br />I am contacting Finis later today to discuss.  Will update when that conversation is done.<br /><br />EDIT - Thought that it would be helpful to chronicle the repair/replacement to (hopefully) show how great Finis is in its customer support.<br /><br />TIMELINE OF RESPONSES:<br />8/12 11:12AM EST - This review is posted<br />8/12 12:30PM EST - Finis responds to this review.  (WOW! Very fast) Says that this is due to an isolated batch and to get a replacement from a new batch.  Suggests I try to wear Neptune and goggles over cap (which I will, I wore them under my cap out of habit.  I wore my SwiMP3's under my cap to help hold them snugly in place).<br />8/12 1:50PM EST - Called Finis.  Was told to fill out Support Ticket.<br />8/12 1:53PM EST - Filled out Support Ticket<br />8/12 1:56PM EST - Reply from Finis (Knew I've been using Finis all these years for a reason).  Please ttach Proof of Purchase<br />8/12 2:24PM EST - Posted Proof of Purchase<br />8/14 1:51PM EST - After not hearing back since Monday, I went back into the Support Ticket site.  It showed the Proof of Purchase that I posted, but it still showed that it was awaiting my reply.  I didn't think this was necessary.  I wrote \\"Proof of Purchase Posted\\".  The Support Ticket site now shows it is \\"Open\\"  Hopefully will be getting a response soon.  Not sure why I had to post that bit even though I posted the Proof of purchase.<br />8/14 3:55PM EST - Received E-mail with an RMA# for me to ship the Neptune back.<br />8/15 9:00AM EST - Neptune is in the mail!<br />8/19 11:30AM EST - Neptune has been delivered and accepted by FINIS<br />8/20 6:25PM EST - E-mail from Finis notifying me that they have received my package.<br />8/2111:32AM EST - E-mail from Finis notifying me that warranty replacement has been processed and another e-mail with tracking information will be sent once it is shipped.<br />8/22 11:36AM EST - Replacement Unit is on its way<br />8/23-9/1 Replacement Unit received.  Was not home so don't know what day it actually arrived (sorry).  Have not tested it yet.<br />9/23 23 Miles Later - Still working, no leaks.  I have upgraded the product review to 3 stars.  Docked it two stars for (a) extra features that are unneccessary and add to cost (screen on back showing what song is playing); (b) original defective unit (c) clip up design rather than clip down design which was (at least for me) sturdier.

B004UG7RQ0|4.0|This works well for me to be able to use a regular device with my original Bose SoundDock. My last iPod broke years ago, and the SoundDock has been sitting on the mantle unused ever since. Until recently, I was unable to enjoy the excellent sound the device offers, but now I can. I use it with my current and previous android device with much success.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's black, so it sticks out like a sore thumb on this and many other apple-white dock devices. Works great though!

B000JMKNJ2|4.0|I really enjoyed the story and found that I couldn't put it down. The world created by Mr. Lynch was deep enough for the story without taking over the story (i.e. you're not reading twenty paragraphs describing a flippin' market square). I enjoyed the anti-hero story and eagerly await Mr. Lynch's next story in this world (or any world for that matter)!

B0074V33MK|5.0|Of all the books written about the British defeat in Singapore and the torture given to the Allied POWs by the Japanese this book details the events most accurately, that are depicted in the original screenplay &#34;Bridge on the river Kwai&#34;  Clearly Cheney, Rumsfeld and GW Bush have not studied the torture and deaths inflicted building the Siam Railway because torture does not seem to yield much info.  Difficult to feel any sorry for the Atom Bomb victims in Japan, innocent people often have to pay for their leaders atrocities and misdeeds, but the bomb was a great event for the railway peoples eventually release

1481879103|4.0|This book was quite possibly the most delightful ghost story I have ever read!  The story is of a strong-willed “old crone” that dies and for the first time in her life begins to make friends.  Well, not exactly in her “life”, which helps set the mood for this rather quirky tale.  The obvious plot is that the heroine, May Elizabeth Trump, tries to help a young woman keep her house, as her mother Penny also recently passed away.  May is actually brought into this dilemma by meeting the dead mother.  May is no ordinary ghost, however.  She has an ability that was rare for ghosts:  she is able to talk to the living!  So, after meeting the living daughter, Chloe, the three develop a plan to raise money for the house.  The idea, which is wrought with flaws, is to act as a medium between other ghosts, with their unfinished business, and the living.  As is often the case with any story worth reading, nothing goes right with this plan.  What is the downfall of their endeavor?  Naturally, the problem is the eccentricities and foibles of all the people, dead and alive, who simply will not cooperate with May, Penny, and Chloe’s plan.<br /><br />Mr John does quite a bit more with the short story than can be summarized above.  To begin, he brings to life a very diverse set of characters with a tremendous amount of personality.  The bickering and banter between them all is quite funny, but frighteningly close to what one would expect to hear between geriatricians at a Bingo hall or the regulars at an old diner.  Most of the characters described are of retirement age, and likewise have outgrown the need for approval of their younger counterparts.  Therefore, they do not attempt to hide their real opinions or nuances.  This alone helps his story flow very naturally and provides most of the entertainment.<br /><br />I also sense some deeper themes.  May Trump, who was a loner during her life, begins to understand her origins, choices, and becomes more open to companionship.  Some of the living also begin to uncover things about themselves while interacting with the dead.  This all happens against an imaginary tapestry of Mr John’s conception of life after death.  What he suggests of the afterlife seemed to me an original idea, and a fairly optimistic one.  At some points, he does paint a little of the macabre against the more lighthearted tone of his writing, which does lends some of the classic spookiness of ghost stories. Then he immediately explains how the ghosts feel in those situations, in stark contrast to the recounting of most hauntings.<br /><br />I would have to agree with the front cover of his book that this is “not your average ghost story.”  It is quite clever, novel, and entertaining fiction.  I laughed frequently.  He provides just enough suspense to keep the reader hooked to the end, and satisfactorily finishes the story with a little twist.  As easy a read as Dead Medium is, it’s more than worth the time.
B005XLN97M|5.0|Cute barbie house.  Quite large, but it has to be to fit those tall barbies! Quite a few pieces to put together.  The stairs and other pieces will be knocked off or taken off by a younger sibling but luckily they snap right back together in most cases and seem no worse for it (stairs have been off and on repeatedly with no issue and bed sat on and popped right back together!).<br /><br />Provides hours of entertainment with barbies!
1781162646|5.0|If you like Mr. King you should have already added this to your cart and be checking out-not reading lame reviews of this masterpiece.  If you decide to read this you should eat first.  If you do not you are indeed lost.  You are not going to have any time to eat or anything else for that matter.  So do yourself a favor and have something to eat before starting this fantastic novel.  I had a professor in college who insisted on oral reports and papers required for the course.  He had this policy because he felt that no students had the talent to write well enough to hold his attention.  For sure he never had Mr. King as a student!<br /><br />Go buy the book.  Don't read it when you are tired because it is too good to \\"waste\\".  This is a masterpiece that Mr. King has been generous enough to share with us common folk.<br /><br />You are gonna love it!!!
B008D28HYS|5.0|This app is excellent. Some of the puzzles are very challenging. It takes so long to figure out some of them that you really feel a sense of accomplishment when you figure them out. I have the original version as well as the color version and I'm very happy with both of them.

B004K8WPUQ|5.0|I am going to write this review from a perspective of an indie filmer looking for a shotgun mic. I owned the original Rode mic. While that mic was great and definitely served its purpose, I found myself wanting the videomic Pro for the +20 gain. I honestly have to say that I pulled the trigger on this purchase. The + in gain provided the right amount of audio minus the all to familiar Hiss. If you are going to use a Rode mic connected to a recorder, the original shotgun is the way to go. If you are going directly into your camera or DSLR the videomic pro is the way to go. Both Mics are great for their intended purposes. Surely if you do not need the audio boost I would go with the original RODE to save yourself some money. If you do get the VMP I also suggest using MICOVER windscreen for outdoors. The micover is so great I can’t even tell its windy out. I hope this review helps answer some questions to the everyday indie filmer.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game came out in 2008 and in 2013 it became popular this game is a fun game but  most people become addicted to it this is a show stoper
B003YL4LYI|3.0|My headline says it all.  George R.R. could have benefited from some heavy editing.  Way more time in the Far East than we need, and a couple key characters got a bit one dimensional.  Most of all, my issues are that the descriptions are way too detailed and way more events are covered than we need to know about.  You are probably safe skimming through the boring stuff.<br /><br />The best part is discussing w/ friends afterwards and looking at all the wiki pages to decide where the story is going after this.  There will be long-standing mysteries and (of course!) cliffhangers to resolve.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like temple run 1 better. Temple run 2 is really hard. The game gets better as you do at playing it. I recommend it for people who think that temple run 1 is super easy.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Love it! Play it every night before going to bed. Relaxes me and takes my mind off everything, Good night.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Definitely worth the money even though it could have been longer. Fun, challenging, and different. This game makes you think and solve puzzles. The 3d makes it that much better.

B0054SMIH6|5.0|Enough twists to keep you on your toes, right up to the end. Right balance of storyline and action. Nothing over-the-top. Highly recommend.
0064471837|5.0|I have reread Sabriel enough times that my original copy, gifted from an older sibling, literally fell apart. The story line is rich and descriptive and it has what I love in the fantasy genre, a hint at more. Older stories hidden in the world created. I'm pretty sure there is some sort of official word for that kinda thing but for me it simply meant I was hooked and wanted to keep reading about the Old Kingdom. The main characters have depth and Sabriel is the ideal heroine. I loved how this book and the series as a whole manages to combine so many elements. There is fantasy, a bit of horror or gore you could say in some of the necromancy parts along with a dash of romance, mystery and adventure. I wont go on some long winded summary but its one of my childhood favorites and every few years I'll still pick up my rebought (and now very tattered) copy and start the adventure all over again. And I think that counts as a 5 star kinda book.
B00DQT1EOI|4.0|Definitely Worth the time. Has good breadth to provide a decent overview. Not a hands on implementation guide though...<br /><br />Enjoy

B003NRYMZQ|4.0|If you think this show is about a team tracking down aliens, then don't expect to much. Its a little bit of the Outer limits, the twilight zone and invaders. Take your pick. The American lead actor of the team is pretty good, but the British police women is kind of goofy and sleeps with quite a few guys in various stories. The stories keep you watching the show and not the sex scenes
B009XIXVU6|1.0|Beginning with the fact that the plot line never becomes apparent and the novel is one disconnected anecdote after another making one wonder about the writer's purpose.  I taught one of his books in a Literature class where we examined the history/background of the story from political and religions standpoints, became involved with the characters and events and  analyzed the plot from Foreword to Add Notes.........all agreed it was a marvelous piece.  This compounds the disappointment with the Mountains... story.<br />  The order of the story seems to be manufactured at times to make incidents fit.  I did not do the step-by-step analysis this time, but it just did not flow and several anecdotes were out of place (or so it seemed).<br />  The author is well educated and has the experiences to convey to the reader the emotional trauma, hardships and family upheaval of that part of the world and time.....no reason why some of the aspects of this book could not have been reconstructed and made into a viable story.<br />  Hope to see him again.........

B00637D114|5.0|The Smurfs upgraded big time in a major improvement, I'll probably get the second movie when it comes out.  Much of the Smurfs' theme seems very Bibilical, biased toward supporting a male-dominated role when it comes that Smurfette was created by Garmacal, e.g. Adam and Eve.  Why is Eve referred to Evil?

B00COMLLX2|1.0|Sadly I would hate to say it, but the PC version of the game is better, although the add-ons for the Tablet version are cheaper, the PC add-ons are expensive compared to the Tablet version costs.  It's the controls that got me stumped.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I liked it to say the least it was fun.  Typical run-style game where you'd guide the player to safety even with a Despicable Me theme.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Piper Kerman's memoir is, among other things, an indictment of our prison system. But it's also a touching story of self-realization, told with humor, kindness, and intelligence.  It's frank but not salacious, and I think any relatively open-minded woman would enjoy it.

Pretentiousness has a home in every Wes Anderson film but it has really settled in with this excruciatingly self-absorbed depiction of 'the spiritual quest'<br />I know the humor in his films is supposed to be accompanied with wry smiles and polite nods to the deadpan 'banter' but this one was grueling.<br />There is absolutely no character to identify with- other than the train conductor who had these guys pegged as effete spoiled trust funders who know nothing about the worlld outside of their very small lives.<br />To embark on a spiritual journey implies that one has a soul- I defy you to find the hint of one in the three brothers.<br />The only redeeming thing in this painful experience is Bill Murray cameos. That's it.<br />We are left with the hopeful closing of a stowaway tiger on board-<br />I'm rooting for the big cat.<br />The cinematography was nice.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I loved this series and couldn't put it down! I read all three books in 10 days and loved every chapter....really wish we knew the rest of the story!!!!!  Also a great translation - almost as if is was originally written in English, well done!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|It's the complete set of Harry Potter movies in one box.  Seriously, what more could you ask for?  I love these movies, and this was a great way to get them all at once.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I have read all the other Lee Child/Jack Reacher books and although this was his first, it was very good!  This book sets up many of the other books and fills in the missing pieces!
B00B1RB942|5.0|This was one of the best anime i have ever seen it has a high re-watch value and it's beautiful
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Beautiful graphics, fun puzzles.  Exactly what a puzzle game should be. On the order of Must which was a blast.. Better tho cause it can be played on .y Kindle Fire.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|You will certainly want to add this to your 3D/holiday collection ! I love this movie in normal viewing but couldn't believe the 3D effects ! its so cool ! the kids will love it :)
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|really now, who doesn't love a classic.... however i think i prefer sappy happy endingds with no bloodshed.... weaksauce ;)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is a refreshing TV show when reality and cop shows dominate the schedule!  I have really enjoyed the three seasons.  Thank you!
B0097C8XL0|5.0|Go to the shop go to the second penguin press log on to facebook go to the menu get back to the game and you have it
B008XG1X18|3.0|&quot;Pinterest is not responding. Would you like to close it?&quot;<br />Am I the only one with this problem? It used to work fine.
B0064MGU98|5.0|We started watching the Good Wife when it first came on in Season 1, but got side tracked.  Glad to be catching up.  So glad that Amazon Prime has it for FREE!!!  Thanks!
B003NFM3JU|5.0|This movie to begin with is awesome but in 3D it makes it that much better ! I highly recommend this !
B00821OX98|5.0|It's all about the people, if I don't find them memorable and likable,  I'm not watching.  Falling Skies is engaging and has just enough cliff hangers to make you keep pressing play.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|It really sucks that DUKE was killed off - that cost the rating a star. (hope this doesn't spoil it for anyone.) Really good movie, lot of action, but there were just a few parts that didn't make sense.
B003YL4KS0|3.0|This book was a wonderful read, for my hair type.  It was a bit limiting, but there was a nice bit of info regarding conditioners, which I did not know.  For that alone, this book would have scored a solid 5.  However, I purchased the enhanced version thinking I could watch the embedded videos.  Wrong.  I have an Android tablet.  No Flash capability, nor can I install Flash.  By the by, cannot be installed on Kindle either.  Perhaps it's time to discontinue selling the enhanced version of this book, since one cannot view the embedded videos.  Aside from that, if you have curly hair and have always wanted to know how to better care for your beautifully curly tresses, then this is a fabulous read.
B005XN0SGU|5.0|Does exactly what I need it to do. Opens all of the file types that it says it does, and very easy to use.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|you don't always feel satisfied at the ending of a long series. This one is a nail bitter and a tear jerker.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I've always liked Cruise because he has the ability to deliver on screen. This was no different, and Freeman's role was just as important. Great entertainment within the sci-fi arena.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was one of the most gripping stories I have read. It kept me guessing from one event to the next. I thought the way it was presented was unusual and effective. But the ending was so very anticlimactic and weak. It left me feeling disappointed. I don't know that I would recommend it because of the poor ending.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|I love this series, it is just great now as it was when it was first broadcast.<br />Glad to see it available.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've always been a fan of card games and this is a great game when playing alone.  Next to spider Solitaire this is the basic card game
B004UNX1LS|5.0|My friend got this and she said it was great so I decided to get it and it is awesome
B007BZM3HK|4.0|This is one of those songs that gets into your head and stays for days. Even though it's annoying, it's catchy and I can't seem to hate it!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|the book has a lot of characters to remember / absorb...first 300 pages were a little slow...but the wife likes it...
0670023329|3.0|For essay assignment for our 10th grader at a college prep school. We normally would not watch this type of program.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Castle is my favorite romantic dramedy, and this season did not disappoint. We get to see more depth with the actors and even more crazy situations that somehow work perfectly with the show. The writers are brilliant and the bloopers are to die for.<br /><br />I totally recommend this!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I've always loved playing card games and this one makes it even more fun to play solitaire.  What will they think of next!!!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|This app works great on my kindle I love it because no other YouTube works<br /><br />Awesome I recommend you to get this
B004GFN11A|5.0|I love Wordpress. I'm self-hosted and use the Wordpress platform for three different websites and love, love, love it! The plugins and themes are fantastic and it's very customizable.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|It addicting and hard not spend money when it's so easy too. Hours of game play and great graphics. Fun and fun and fun.
1616890835|5.0|this book delves into the mystical world of sign writing, the people who do it and the art itself. It is accompanied by a movie and I can't wait to see it on the big screen.
0316067598|5.0|I came in excellent condition and is an amazing read. You can also see some of his speeches on youtube.com
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like it because it is a game you can not put down ,it's like candy crush but so much better. I hope a lot of people feel the same type of way.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|While at the same time - frustrating!!  I love tetris and this is an interesting play on it - requiring you to think before each move where tetris makes you using quick thinking skills.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Good game but won't hold younger kids attention too long. Similar to a Sims game, you create and maintain your own reef.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love playing this game so much fun. Me and my wife challenge each other to see who can run cutter or get more bananas
B0040HO01Y|4.0|This is a different type of show.  Very wholesome I would recommend it to a friend and would br good for family viewing.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|Can you say marathon viewing?  Bet you can't eat just one! If only my family could be so normal. NOT!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Lovely magical story. Great graphics. Some fantastic puzzles and mini games. The only down side to playing on a kindle fire, is the fact that you have to be so exact where you place things, which can be difficult with your finger. But overall, a brilliant game, well worth the download. Looking forward to game 3 :)
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Sometimes it takes find rever to load videos but the settings are very easy to understand so i like it more than others i have a kindle fire
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I had misgivings when the different characters stepped on stage in subsequent chapters, but once I got into their lives, I couldn't quit reading.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the slender man games, I hear they are making a movie but this is the best slender game, lots of area, 2 different areas, night and day mode ,easy,hard,and medium, and you can add fog,totally worth a buck
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have really enjoyed this season of Downtown Abbey. I would recommend it to a friend. Although not always accurate it is a close. Very good history bade.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Simply the best by far, there seems to be an endless translations all superb, easy to follow, I recommend this app strongly.
B002BBJ52U|1.0|The better title should have been \\"Users and Losers\\", as that sums up the two types of characters in this sad statement of today's selfish mating games. I am sure if I could have gotten past the first 30 minutes I might have found 1 redeemable character, but 30 minutes was all I could stomach.<br />The Baltimore scenery was nice.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|How often does an album come around that you can listen to with your mom? This one fits the bill, and it's amazing. Some context: my mom's musical tastes DO NOT generally overlap with mine (with the exception of classical and other instrumental music). I like alternative rock from the '90s, she likes The Carpenters and John Denver. We both like this. Again, it's amazing, and it's for everyone.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I would definitely recommend this, but if I had to rate his three books this would be my least favorite. That said, it was a page turner and beautifully written. He has a great talent for description as well as conveying emotion. (As one reads him, it is obvious how many poorly written best sellers there are).  In this book, the back and forth between the characters was a bit jolting; I felt that I sometimes missed the completion of a character. But I liked that the usual and expected endings were not what we got.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This book sucked. It is just a stupid dictionary. I would not recommend this to the stupidest person on earth
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|It's good but annoying that you keep running out of energy x<br />It's still a good hidden object game with a few addictive mini games and a semi interesting storyline
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I took this on vacation to store my camera and lenses. It was well worth the money. My only problem is the left shoulder strap wouldn't stay locked in position, but I'm sure if I work on it I can fix it.
0143116738|4.0|I picked up the book on the recommendation of a friend as we were discussing the driving elements of \\"Following your bliss\\".  Joseph Campbell was one of my favorite authors, and his admonition to follow your bliss to find your purpose is restated here, in a more modern and actionable form, by Sir Ken Robinson.<br /><br />The book has two major components - the first is the premise and exploration of the theory that we need to find the intersection of talent and passion in order to ensure that our life is fulfilling and that we are ultimately successful.  He uses examples of Richard Branson and Gillian Lynne among others as examples of those who followed this path, and operated outside the primary educational systems to become successful.  The second premise is that our education system is not conducive to actually promoting this approach to life, and instead we stifle creativity and the ability to follow our passions - or even identify those talents and passions.<br /><br />Robinson's theories are a bit provocative, and also pretty resonant with this reader.  How to identify the \\"Element\\" in each of us is a critical element to happiness, and we rarely do this on a systematic basis.  Anyone looking to buy this book should listen to his TED talk as well - it will give a 20 minute flavor of the thoughts and approach, and also is darn well done.<br /><br />Follow your bliss, find your element.  Read this book to help motivate you to do both.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|This is a relevant rendition of the original movie Footloose. I liked it because they didn't just redo the original with a new cast. There is originality in the screenplay that still does the basic plotline of the original movie justice. I recommend it. It's a good movie and entertaining :-)
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Awesome show. Friend told me that this series was good a long time ago but didnt get around to watching it till now! Go watch it if you haven't seen it yet!
0307744434|3.0|\\"It's not you, it's me.\\", as George on the Seinfeld show used to tell the woman he was breaking up with to try to let her down gently. Well, in the case of this book, I could use a similar line since the writing is excellent, descriptive and the plot imaginative. The problem? I am not a fan of fantasy, magic, or vampire type stories. Some supernatural I can put up with (King, Koontz, Martin etc.) but the magic in this one is just too far out for me. Guess the great reviews sucked me in and once there I at least found it compelling enough to finish. For those who enjoy the genre, you will love it.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|The entire family loves this series.  So many twists and characters. Great writing.  Can't wait for the new season to start.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Not a big fan of Tom Cruise but he makes it work in this picture.  Both the females leads are believable and exciting to watch.  I enjoy SciFi movies so perhaps I am biased but this movie was very good. The cinematography was well done, as is the sound track...I may be dating myself with the music.  The subject matter also may be a little over done - Planet of the Apes, Matrix, others but I still found a new feel to the plot, which had an Excellent twist.<br />Enjoy!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Love this book! I found out new informations and the other side of situations. I went back and read the entire series again!! If you love this series you MUST read this!
B0011MZOEI|4.0|I love this movie. Between Justin Long's humor and Bruce Willis' heroics, this movie is fun and entertaining from start to finish. Definitely one of my favorites in the Die Hard series.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|Very interesting movie... It's a little confusing in the beginning but you catch on after a little bit. And once you do, and all the crazy stuff starts happening you're just saying to yourself, &#34;ohh mann.... whoaaa, wait! WHAT???&#34; Keeps you on your toes the whole time and its not predictable.
1594204217|4.0|It is a rare writer who can turn the mundane into the magnificent, but Pollan manages to do so. I picked the book up in the store and was caught by the story of the art (and it is) of whole pig barbecue in the \\"Fire\\" section so made the purchase. His divides the book into sections on Fire, Water, Air, and Earth and then proceeds to provide more detail in each than I would have thought possible. He has a unique ability to make some of the most trivial item into something of vital interest. Despite the fact that this arena is not high on my list of topics, it turned out to be a worthy read.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|It was fun for a while but then it got kinda boring. It is just like subway surfers. If I wanted to play that game, I would've played that one instead of this. Plus, you have to have wifi?!?! I usually play games when I'm somewhere with no wifi. Plus, it takes a lot of your application space. After a week I deleted this game. Thanks for taking your time to read my review! Hope it was helpful. ~Briana Sutton
B00BAB6CNC|4.0|I have it in the CD player right now. I think I like it better or just as much as the first. It's well worth the play.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|My husband loves this show and it is nice that he can watch at his own leisure. With two kids it's hard to find time to watch your favorite shows.
B00634GHJA|1.0|It sucked the life out of my battery. My phone went back to normal as soon as I uninstalled it.
0307719774|5.0|I really love this journal. Its nice to have because Im bad about writing everyday and this is so simple to write a sentence to the prompt. Or to help spark interest and then I can write a full entry into my regular journal. It's small enough to carry around with you. It's a lot of fun to look back at your responses from each day of the previous years. You should definitely get one
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|Fowler lets you see th world through the eyes of a human who knows and cherishes the ape in herself.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I thought the movie was suspenseful and therefore held my attention. Tommy Lee Jones was good as always as a tough guy
B0085A9HU6|5.0|this is one of the greatest movies out there. This is my first copy on DVD, I have two others on VHS still. I love this movie, and the DVD makes it easier to watch!
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I felt this book was trite and condescending. Within the early pages you knew exactly who killed Janie,but the author thought the reader would be , oh no..shocked!! The other two storylines were also filled with fluff and boring. If I wanted to read Danielle Steele I would.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It was an interesting plot and the book kept you wanting to read more. However, didn't like how the story ended. Just felt like justice should have been served.
B00BE5U7P8|5.0|Actually it is fun :) even when I am total newbee to the programming I perfectly understand what the author is telling me ...
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The title pretty says it all.  I like it, I use it and like I said, it works.  For me that is all important, which is why I gave it a five star rating.
B00B3L3RPA|4.0|A tale of a creator & the created struggling between selfishness & love for the other. Not at all what a reader would expect after being told the basic story through movies during childhood. Excellently written with beautiful language & consideration.
B008YZXYY2|4.0|I like this very much. But who doesn't love Corey Taylor? The music is solid and well worth the listen! I bought both albums together and am not disappointed at all.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The story was more realistic. I hated the ending to the 3rd book because it just left you hanging. I cannot wait for the next books of this series. I'll stop whatever I'm reading to pick it back up.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|It's awesome it's just like call of duty with some small bugs<br />Guv the last exercise and the correct tips and the correct tips on how much does it take by
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read the first book and instantly wanted more. Each chapter of this series left me wanting more. The stories of different people is interwoven expertly and adds so much dimension to the entire plot.  I love that each book in the series builds on the other, you are catapulted into the world of the characters and  the plot expands for the reader just as it does for the characters. My imagination runs wild with the possibilities of silos and this world. I can't wait to read more about this world Hugh Howey created.
0064471837|5.0|This book and the Abhorsen series in general are one of, if not, my favourite fantasy novels ever!<br /><br />I first read Lirael on a plane for a family holiday. I picked it up at random in the airport and had no idea how many times I would read it after I got home. I bought Sabriel and Abhorsen the minute I arrived back in the UK and i've been waiting to read Clariel for years now!<br /><br />I'm obsessed with magic. In most of the books I read it has to be present in some sort. The depth Garth Nix explains charter magic and free magic is fascinating. He really involves you in his world which centres around Sabriel the main character dealing with her destiny to become the next Abhorsen in a war-torn Kingdom with no ruler. An abhorsen wields bells, like necromancers in the books, to defend the people against the dead. She is tasked with rescuing her father, the abhorsen, and preventing the Old Kingdom from falling into the clutches of the greater dead which after 200 years of chaos are everywhere!<br /><br />It is a fast paced easy read which teases and coaxes the reader as they go along. The plot twists are great and you don't see them coming. I could easily sit down and read this book all the way through any day of the week!<br />Garth Nix explains his world to you so much so you find yourself becoming a part of it! You have a million questions about what would happen if a certain person did that with magic, or can they do that with magic? I cannot wait for the next book!<br />It even interested me in writing myself!
1465408681|3.0|What is your favourite character in the Star Wars realm?  I will admit I have a few - the Ewoks, Chewbacca, C3PO, R2-D2 and Yoda.  When I saw this book at DK I knew it would be a huge hit for my own kids who love everything related to Star Wars and Lego.<br /><br />The book contains numerous facts about Yoda and his life as a Jedi Master.  I haven't realized how he was linked to some of the other characters before.  In this fun book, you will have the possibility to explore his home on Dagobah, discover his allies and enemies, see what some of his friends think where he comes from (love the answer of Chewbacca!), discover if you could be one of his padawans and much more.<br /><br />The book also comes with an exclusive figurine from Star Wars which will be loved by many little boys out there.<br /><br />This book is perfect to encourage boys at age 7-10 to read as not only it has an interesting subject of matter - Yoda of Star Wars - but it also incorporate one of the favourite toys for kids i.e. Lego.  All the images included in this book are made using the Lego Star Wars collection that was made available through the years.  It is interactive in a way that the child can engage with the book with fun pages like \\"Where Does YODA Come From?\\" or \\"Could You Be One of Yoda's Padawans?\\".  I find it a great book to give as a threat when the child accomplish something important or for a birthday or Christmas.  Bottom line, it's a great book to learn more about a famous character in Star Wars!
1878424319|1.0|I read this book a few years ago.  It's an oversimplification of how to live your life and I feel telling people to never care about other people's opinions is wrong.  No you shouldn't let a careless comment from a stranger or acquaintance devastate you but you should care what your family and friends think.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|Doesn't work properly on Galaxy Note 2. Unplayable.<br /><br />Also, the app costs $.99 for 5 levels, and then there is an in app purchase for a 'lifetime pass' for all future levels added. However many that may be.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My granddaughter &amp; I played this game together &amp; we BOTH had fun figuring out the various puzzles. Sometimes it took both of us to figure out how to get out of  each room. Can't wait for upcoming me les to play. Hope we don't have to wait too lo g to update this game!
B00CU8OVIM|3.0|First realize this is just a opinion, and im not going to go into detail like other reviews like mention each song because this is based on the album overall. J.cole to me is a average rapper who can rhyme.What i mean is being a 80's baby born and raised in new york i was old enough to remember 2pac(before he went all westside and death row) and big(when they were still alive)jayz,nas,az,mobb deep,outcast,wu tang,mase,lox,black rob(what i like to call the bad boy era when big was alive) in their prime coming out.anybody will tell you if you look at any rapper in the 90's era(golden era of hip hop you lived through it not doing hip hop research on how it was like) all was lyrical even if you did not blow up mainstream(are you came and went like oynx and the lost boys) or a one hit wonder(smooth da hustler broken langyage) you were lyrical or you would not get any play(as in cam'ron would not have pulled a computers putin kinda line in the 90's when Big L was around).Now fast foward 2013 where rhymes dont really matter and most rappers are below average,so when you do have a rapper who is decent by today's standards he is lyrical legend.That how i feel about j.cole,to me he is boring.<br /><br />  Im not sayin j.cole is wack,but nothing about him stands out.i thought the way people kept saying born sinner was a classic i thought wow!!! this dude must have dropped a illmatic,reasonable doubt,aqumini,its dark and hell is hot,hell on earth album of 2013(i call these albums classics because i bought these albums more than 3 times over the last 10-15 years cuz i first had them on tapes,lost them just to end up getting the cd's later or my first cd was really scratched since i had to constantly move them around cuz this was before mp3 were even thought of)<br /><br />  anyway i bought the album played it through a few times and honestly only song i remember was let nas down only cuz that album was heartfelt and i respect his struggle and what he had to get through to be where he is at now(plus nas doing the remix made it a classic passing of the torch moment.he had two other songs,but i honestly  think is because of the classic outcast beat and tribe call quest beat which stuck with me all these years when they first drop their songs(i hate to sound like im old,but i guess im old in hip hop years lol).anyway to me and what i seen in hip hop you really have to be different or make catchy music that will stick with me to replay a album.drake is this era mase,he is lyrical(all u haters just admit it)he can make party music,and mix r&b and for him it works.same with asap rocky,but asap rocky has eerie mellow beats thats fits him when singing the hook and he lyrical.kayne west pushed hip hop forward and honestly nobody realize he is the reason you can have a drake and j.cole because kayne west showed you dont have to be a thug to sell records because he blew up after the 50 cent/gunit era(where you had to be a thug/drug dealer to sell record for awhile in hip hop for awhile.also kendrick lamar is this era new nas,in which he is lyrical,music has substance, and concepts which made his last album seem like a story being told.anyway drake,asap rocky,kayne west,kendrick lamar  are artist that stood out and made me want to buy their albums,while j.cole(or wale for that matter)just can put decent rhymes together but their albums will collect dust after a few listens.this is why yeezus is the album you may not like it because it's different but after awhile the songs  grow on you because it takes you out your comfort zone,when born sinner has the opposite effect where after a few listens the album gets boring and wont care to play it years from now.when i think about it, if j.cole did not try go up against yeezus i dont think it would get all this attention and if this album came out in the 90's it won't get called a classic because it has decent songs.Ask yourself this,if jayz did not sign j.cole would he even get attention.im not hating on j.cole im just doing this because all this album hype was based off him going against yeezus,i think asap rocky album was hot too but i guess we have to wait til his second album to get as much attention.
030746363X|5.0|Well, I got it when it came out and there are a million reviews for it already, so let me just say that I totally recommend this book, in fact I've loaned it out a few times, and come to think of it, I actually had to buy a second copy because someone &#34;borrowed&#34; my first one for a long time.  They still have it, apparently.<br /><br />Okay, so here's something that I don't agree with, as practiced over time, the &#34;cheat day&#34; and the consequences of allowing a cheat day in your diet.  I did follow this plan, the slow carb plan and the cheat day, etc., when I first got this book.  The problem comes when one realizes the effects of gluten, go read Wheat Belly if you have not yet done so.<br /><br />So, these day's I'm paleo and have lost about 40 pounds in 5 months, give or take, I'm not sure exactly how much fat I've lost because I've gained weight in muscle due to my work outs.  But I'm going to say I like the paleo lifestyle much better than following the slow carb diet, but keep in mind, it's a lifestyle and not a diet.<br /><br />As to the rest of the book I was highly entertained and have read some of the articles multiple times.<br /><br />The chapter on reversing injuries was very helpful to me and I credit some of the back exercises with helping me relive back pain, I also was inspired to work on this more and started yoga, in a few months I eliminated nearly all lower back pain.  This was well worth the price of the book.<br /><br />I follow Tim on his blog, he's an amazing marketing genius and a great writer and an interesting person, so I recommend the book.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|Sophie kinsella's Twenties Girl is an enchanting picture of a lovely ghost named Sadie. If haunting is to be done make it by Sadie. I enjoyed every delicious word of this novel. Kinsella does her research, so I got a definite feel for the Roaring Twenties. No more will be revealed so you, too, may have happy haunting. Whatever kinsella's writes, I will read!
B000EZIJKO|5.0|Roald Dahl's classic story that teaches that living by the golden rule is the way to go, and  that dreams do come true. A great story to teach kids the proper way to behave while entrancing them with Mr. Wonka's mystical world!

B005IQZB14|4.0|The writing was descriptive enough to envision while crisp and brief enough to maintain interest.  I was flipping pages as the miles went by, wanting to get to the end, and wishing there were pictures to get a glimpse of the varied terrain and the views described.  Fortunately when I was that age I went with a group from north of San Francisco to Mexico camping along the way and could use my imagination.  Now 58, divorced, having raised two sons, experienced my Mom's death, unemployment and financial stress, I too can look back with fond memories as I sit alone and maintain trust of survival in the Times to come.  This book brought me back to the basics of living this one life.  Cheryl
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I learned of this series late in the game after hearing some much critical acclaim; however, it does not disappoint.  I wish there were more episodes.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I agree with much of the criticism that relays that by this stage of the \\"game\\" things should be picking up. There are enough characters and side plots already in this story line without introducing more. That being said, I will stick it out with this series to see where the author will take it. I am a firm believer in the idea of the creator of a story is wholly accountable and responsible for how it turns out; for good or bad. It is a product of an individual's endeavors, and we, as consumers are along for the ride. This latest book is long winded and actually boring in part, totally unlike the first 3 or 4.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I enjoyed this book. This is the first vampire book I have read. I look forward to reading more. Now on to read more public domain books. I love free. Lol
B0012YYZYK|5.0|LOVE IT IF YOU LOVE LED ZEP GET THIS CD W DVD BONUS NOT DISAPPOINTED  WISH THEY WOULD TOUR SOON
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a awesome game!If you don't have it you should.You won't regret getting it.It takes WiFi to play but fun!
B006GLM5EQ|4.0|Seasons 1 -3 were great.  Most recent seasons became to political.  I felt like I was watching propaganda TV, but Ball is known for adding politics in his shows.  Glad he is gone.
B009LRE040|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars had there been a little less violence. Over all a good movie. Bane is a great character, but didn't like how they brought in the woman...a bit confusing.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|THIS WAS A VERY CHALLENGING GAME AND I REALLY ENJOY PLAYING IT.  SO GLAD TO HAVE ANOTHER GAME THAT JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER.
B009329ZF2|5.0|There, I said it! I mean, sure, there are a LOT of similarities, and this is essentially a big VFX tentpole film, but I still enjoyed the characters more than I enjoy Michael Bay's harem running around in front of Shia LaBeouf.<br /><br />I also thoroughly enjoyed the fact that the true heroes of this film aren't the young bucks who grew up with everything handed to them: it's the old dogs who know how to fight and work hard.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|It's a true story, but the trials that Chris went through in his life are so unbelievable you might mistake it for fiction.  If you want to be inspired to make more of yourself read this book.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|It tends to glitch. Every game of uno I've played it glitches at least once. It completely freezes for about 20+ seconds and has even exited the game completely. This wouldn't be that bad if you didn't have a limited number of plays.  All in all the game is actually a lot of fun! I would give it 5 stars if they fixed these problems.
B000005AYM|5.0|I loaned my original to my brother- in -law and looked for it for 2 years...1 store wanted $38.00 for it...
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Its a great game but could use some updates but as soon as updates come out it will be just as good as regular weaphones i love ww2
0345442970|3.0|I know that some of the complaints about Episode I were how politically driven it was, and who cares about spacelane taxation. But since that is a reality, why not make that story better, more understandable, and better explained? That's what this book is all about. It centers on Chancellor Velorum's previous dealings with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, and really makes Episode I quite a bit better after reading this.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|Wow, that's all really negative, huh? Makes you wonder why this product even exists when there are much faster options out there like, for example, Amazon's own Kindle app, which reads pdfs even better than Adobe's pdf viewer...
0470876417|5.0|One page method is genius. Removes alot of the complexities and makes it easier to focus on the things that matter.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great app to have when you need to pass some time...like at an appointment. Just like what you would have on your home computer.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|Just 3/4s completed, but enjoying the read especially with it being so handy on the smart phone for reading anywhere.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very fun but the thing is I want to collect more tokens and I faint which sucks but everything else is awesome
B004V73FGE|5.0|I know this movie didn't do that well or as well as expected in theaters but my wife and I thought it was pretty darn good.  Just a fun entertaining somewhat thought provoking movie.  Hoping for a part 2.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|And I further dislike his insatiable need to slap me in the face with them through his films.<br /><br />Batman has become the secret symbol of the real-world Team America &#34;I'm just gonna do what has to be done, derp!&#34;<br /><br />Oh, that and Bane's physique, intellect, and athletic ability is so down-played as to be laughable. He is not Bane, rather, I don't know, someone else.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Get this game it is so fun it is the best game I have ever played!!!<br />Funniest game get your own people really fun game get it!!! :)
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This one is really amazing and so simple to use. Beats all others by a hundred miles. Happy I bought it.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|George R. R. Martin is a master story teller and a writer of tremendous talent.  He develops a huge number of characters into many plots and story lines and manages to keep it all moving forward and inter-related.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|Don't know whether the mic or the wired receiver crapped out, but something isn't right, and the product was made useless after a very short run. For professional gear, this is not cool.<br /><br />Save up a little longer, and look elsewhere.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Good dictionary I recommend this book if ur in a hurry and only dictionary is this otherwise stick to the cover and pages book
1401307957|5.0|Danny Gregory has a touching outlook on life.  He has lived through some events that have led him to view life as a gift.  It has led him to know that Every Day truly Matters.  The drawings in the book are delightful, illustrate his insights, and provide inspiration to sketchers all over the world. This book provided me with a glimpse of an artist's motivation, ideas for my own sketchbook/journaling and food for the soul.  It's well worth the read, and saving for perusing off and on as need arises for personal motivation.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love it keeps you busy and i love to be distracted from family time to time awsome awsome awsome
B00821OX98|2.0|I was excited to watch this, but was quickly disappointed by the storyline.  Noah Wyle is wonderful, as usual, but his acting skills were not enough to keep me hooked. The characters are silly and affected, and they make inexcusable, ridiculous choices (like making a racist kidnapper/murderer the group cook because he knows how to prepare chicken). The aliens are interesting, the apocalyptic backdrop is a cool (if not original) idea, but I found myself rolling my eyes at the idiotic decisions that the characters make. Unwatchable.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|No, really, I mean it: Sherlock keeps throwing out lines about how &#34;It wasn't a mistake- it's by design&#34; while half nude/half cross-dressed, sprawling all over Watson, and Mycroft makes wisecracks about how it's difficult to imagine how a man can get along in the company of a woman while he totally exposes himself to Watson's fiance.<br /><br />Yes, these moments are actually kind of funny, but activism-infused media is actually really not.<br /><br />British culture has far more depth than the Gay/Straight dichotomy that we love to parade around [literally] here in the US, and I found it offensive that Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes are being made into LGBT champions: If you want equality, then don't draw so much attention to the controversy [which actually never appears in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's writing of this character, BTW] and just make Holmes an interesting character for his attributes OTHER than sexual orientation. He SHOULD be a character who can be admired by anyone, of any orientation. THAT is equality.<br /><br />&#60;/rant&#62;
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This is a good dictionary I recommend this if u have time and want to look up a word but to me the actual book book is a taste and easier way to look up words that's my opinion though
1592537251|5.0|There are urban sketchers all over the world.  They sketch in small groups, sometimes alone or in scheduled &#34;sketch crawls&#34;.  They have guidelines for contributing to their websites (all over the internet), and you can google them to see if a group is near you.  This book is authored by the originator of this world-wide movement, Gabriel Campanario.  He's from Barcelona, but has lived all over the world and now resides in Seattle.  The book features artists work depicting urban landscapes all over the globe.  Talk about inspiration!!  After looking over the entries, you will be hard-put not to grab your pencils, sketchbooks and head out to the street corner to record your city view!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an awesome game to play when you're chilling at home by yourself, or to take turns with a group of any size. Please try it some time
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a great description of how something that seem good or at least harmless initially can turn into something twisted.  The story of the treasure hunt and its clues seemed like a true attempt at reconciliation and then so completely like the vengeful game that it was.  The descriptions of the layers of the psychological dysfunctions within the families were well written and yet inflated just enough to keep the reader entertained.  The ultimate message seemed to be about the folly of believing you can win when dealing with a sociopath - perhaps not applicable in everyday life but a fact that can be useful when one find's oneself &#34;in love&#34; with the wrong person.  A good read.
B006PZBR8S|4.0|Nothing wrong with the ending of this movie. On the dvd you can opt to watch an alternate ending, but I think the studio made the right choice with the theatrical release on this one. Great flick to watch with your kids!
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|It is a great app but there are a few things I don't like.  There sensitivity I have to ask other pure people the answer to
B00422LESO|4.0|This is a quirky and fun book. It's great for those who love Pride & Prejudice and want a quick read.
B00CTKHXFO|4.0|It is nice, it was something different that I expected because you how to download Metal Gear Solid from the server, but its ok. Also the version of metal gear is different from the NES version.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Free games shouldn't require further purchases in order to be played! Also Kindle Fire screen is too small for this game
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green is a great writer!  I could see his wit and humor through out the book and yet feel the seriousness as well.  Bravo!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game is awesome. I am thirteen and I love it. It is a great game for little girls, and boys, if they would like to become a designer.
B004TNGLW0|3.0|The movie is great, but you know that.<br /><br />The humidor is great. The built in humidifier is what I have a problem with. The documentation provided states that if I don't use Daniel Marshall Special Care Solution with the humidifier my warranty is voided. Problem is the solution was not provided, you cannot buy it on Amazon, nor can you buy on Daniel Marshall's website. So I had to use plain distilled water, and my hygrometer reads 75.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Action packed.  The entire season I was on the edge of my seat!  I can't wait to finish the series, I'm curious to know how it will end.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Lots of fun, love the tracking angle showing. Great variety of birds/weapons to use. Very relaxing and addictive to play.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|as I said in the title this game is AMAZING. it gets harder as you go. the only problem is that it doesent work sometimes.
B001HPP2X2|2.0|Deaxter is a serial killer who only kills serial killers.  So far, so good.  But, after you know that, the show is relatively dull, and very predictable.  Solutions to many situations are telegraphed (I figured out who the \\"Ice Truck Killer\\" was at first glance, as I'm sure many others did too).<br />Dexter was adopted by a cop who recognized his psychopathy, which was at least partially caused by witnessing the brutal murder of his mother when he was about three years old.  Why he was never put into intensive therapy after his father realized that he had been killing neighborhood dogs is beyond me.  Instead, his father's sage advice was to \\"act normal and try to fit in\\".  C'mon.  Every kid in high school knows that one of the best predictors of a propensity for violent crimes is cruel treatment of animals.  So here's an adopted kid who kills several dogs, buries their bones, and whose father is a cop, and there's no intervention?<br />The people who Dexter kills, in my mind, deserve to die.  They have committed heinous crimes repeatedly.  And I can't help calculating the millions of dollars a year he saves society, not to mention untold heartache that is spared.<br />Maybe I have a psychotic streak as well, because on moral grounds I don't have an objection to what he does.  However, I would like to have seen this series written by more seasoned, nuanced, writers.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Had been using swpye forever but since getting this on my razr maxx there is no going back! Absolutely the very best!
B000IZ8DZQ|5.0|It was just what we expected and more. Everybody enjoyed the drive in movie night at our house, thanks to the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Haven't been able to play because Kindle Fire seems to be too small to see  and also requires additional purchase to play
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I liked it...want to read it again...so many names to remember!  Next time I will write them all down (take notes!)
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Full circle story telling, loved all of stories within the stories.  Khaled Hosseini is thoughtful, deep, and I never want his books to end.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It's so worth your money!!! You can set your alarm as your favorite song. So much better than the free version.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It keeps him busy for hours on end. He says that the missions are very exciting to complete. Despite the T rating, it seems appropriate for somebody much younger.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|ap is awesome very realisti  and fun. just wish u could customize and create your horse though. Other wise very fun app. Download it now.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|It is a very interesting and varied puzzle game. Sometimes you need a lot of patience and intellectual effort to solve the games. Moreover graphics and sfx will not disappointed you. Infrequently, you could find some errors when loading saved levels.
B007N8RULO|3.0|The game is not exciting but hey we're talking solitaire.  I find getting to things like hint or controls to get out of the game awkward and time consuming.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book raps up the story. It answered all of my questions that I was asking at the end if the second book. I really enjoyed it.
1449320104|4.0|This book is about 5 inches thick!  Awesome overview of a very complex language.  Not appropriate for a 'Nutshell' book, but some exercises and bigger examples would help me learn more.  However, great reference book.  O'Reilly books really are the best and this one is no exception.
B008JFUO36|4.0|Finally, we get to see Tom Cruise not doing another Mission Impossible, but a science fiction movie.<br />And because of his acting experiences, it even makes the film better. Its a good looking film, with just enough<br />action, a good story and and great musical score.<br />Recommended, and a keeper for your collection.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is so much better than many of the other escape games.  Makes you actually think about what you have to do in order to open the door. Can't wait for the next level!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Although the characters are well-developed and the plot is just bizarre, I had to  force myself to finish this book.  The ending is mind-numbingly stupid. Both Amy and Nick are despicable people, sick and devious and lying fools.  Save your money, unless you enjoy reading about people you would run from in real life.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The kids love it. Even the little ones. It does take a lot of memory,  more then any game I have downloaded
B00B97TMIE|5.0|I've had minimal exposure to this group, except this album for two weeks and seeing a fascinating documentary on them at BYU.edu.<br />I like this album because they made an album, not a compilation of singles. The songs transition well and this is a great feature of a true album.  The work evokes energy from a variety of emotions, not always dark or angry like many others. I may be late to discover Imagine Dragons, but I still enjoy this product. I recommend others to purchase this, I do not regret mine.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 is very good, although I am more partial to season 1 & 3.  But you need 2 to tie them all together!
B00CS74W0C|5.0|This was a great series! I can't wait for the next installment! These characters become a part of you! Loved every minute!!!
0553208845|5.0|'Siddhartha' is a hard novel to review, because at its core, its really just a book about the circular nature of life and all things.  Obviously, the book relies heavily on ideology from Buddhism, Hinduism, but manages to sound more like a work from Friedrich Nietzsche (the author is German after all).  The novel is great, but much like books like 'Catcher in the Rye', more than likely, you are going to love or hate this book, and you may even feel differently about it depending on what age you are when you read it.  The book is mostly about a young boy named 'Siddhartha' (not the Buddha of the same name, which is a common misconception) who leaves his house, family and life as a brahmin and becomes a \\"wanderer\\", not taking any specific path or having any specific goal other than to just experience life.  Siddhartha rejects ANY form of teaching, because he believes them all to be one-sided, and even rejects Buddhism after speaking with the Buddha Gotama (which I assume is supposed to represent the original Buddha Siddhartha Gautama).  Unlike 'Catcher' this novel is much more complex and circular, favoring an ending that explains why wisdom comes with age, and why you see things differently at different time points in your life (even though time doesn't exist ;)  I would recommend this to anyone that liked 'Catcher in the Rye', 'A Clockwork Orange', and/or 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra' (or similar works).
B00E8B1358|4.0|Also if you like the me lieu in which this is based.  It has great cinematography. It was as good as the first one.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I initially found out about the book when Wayne Dyer posted on his Facebook page how much he was enjoying the exercises.  His response peaked my curiosity, so I downloaded it from Amazon and started the experiments that very day.<br /><br />I am 52 years old and my father was an alternative medicine practitioner.  In other words, I was raised with the concept that we are energy and that miracles happen every day - if you allow them.  I am not new to the concept of the law of attraction.  Heck, I have not only drank the kool-aid, my father probably asked me to pass it out for him.<br /><br />So, this said, I have to admit to you that every single one of the experiments in the book E-Squared was absolutely magical for me.  The manifestations were right on, and on some days, I truly enjoyed Spirit's sense of humor.  For example on one day, we were supposed to manifest butterflies.  It was a rainy, dreary day and I laughed, \\"Let's see how you're going to pull off butterflies in this weather, Spirit!\\"  The joke was on me.  The first place I walked into, right by the door was a 1000 piece puzzle called \\"Butterfly Garden\\" with hundreds of colorful butterflies all over the cover.  It was on sale and I bought it, of course.<br /><br />It's a true joy to be that connected with Spirit that you can share a laugh and talk so freely about this things that you would like to manifest.  I strongly encourage you to try it out for yourself.
0792839749|4.0|Grandaughter very happy, will play a lot in the future. Shipped just fine, no problems. Also free download is saved for grandparents house. Love seeing kids happy.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Still enjoying it because I am invested in the characters and want to see the entire story through but it is not riveting... I am only half way through and am surporsed many of  the main characters haven't even been discussed yet...although I'm sure they will either by the end of the book or in book 5.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|I had read a bunch of Sherlock Holmes novels as part of one of my college classes and thus became a huge fan of Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle's works.  I very much enjoyed this series.  BBC always has an excellent production and definitely did justice to the Canon.
0143121421|4.0|I read and article about le Carre somewhere and decided to give it a try.  Really enjoyed the book.  Fast read; crisp writing.  Highly recommend.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It works great on my Kindle Fire and is very handy to have around.  Very pleased with how it works!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. It is funny all the way through the movie, and the music is terrific. I watch it whenever I need a little lift, and I downloaded a lot of the music also. I find that watching this movie makes long plane rides go by much faster. Lots of fun!
B003OUXECE|5.0|I have played the games and fell in love with rapture...this book brings a whole new depth to the world of bioshock.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I love this app. It's really addictive, but every now and then when I tap the app icon on home, my keyboard pops up. It makes it really hard to see the bottom of my screen.

B0071MV540|4.0|I saw this movie at my brother's house. It was so funny I had to have a copy for myself. Good family entertainment
B001EO2UJK|5.0|Having been a child of the 80's, I grew up hearing Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins songs on the radio. Years later, in my early adulthood, I discovered that both vocalists had at one time been in a band together called Genesis. It was then that I discovered Trespass, Nursery Cryme, Foxtrot, Selling England By The Pound, and The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway.<br /><br />Back then, the only copies of these albums available were the Definitive Edition Remasters that were issued by Atlantic Records in The U.S. and Canada back in 1994. I bought copies of all these albums, and loved them all. But I couldn't  help but notice the mediocre sound quality of them. They didn't sound remastered at all. They sounded like they were recorded in a garbage can!<br /><br />All the electric instruments, i.e. electric guitar, bass guitar, organ, electric piano, and mellotron drown out some of the sounds of the acoustic instruments, including the flute, tambourine, and bass drum, as well as some of the 12-string guitar chords and  percussion sounds. Even some of Peter's vocal effects were either heavily distorted or barely even audible! This is inexcusable for Genesis, because a fair deal of the enjoyment in listening to classic Genesis is hearing Peter's hilarious voices and thick accents that he would embellish his characters with in many of these songs.<br /><br />But, that has been remedied with this box set. These are the real deal as far as  sound quality is concerned. Keep in mind that these recordings are 35+ years old, and I have listened to them millions upon millions of times. I know each of these tunes front to back and vice-versa, and I can whistle them note for note.<br /><br />A prime example is when I first listened to the new mix of the intro to the Fountain Of Salmacis which consists of a subtle buildup of guitar,organ, bass and drums backed by mellotron, where the notes become louder and louder until the drums come into a crashing crescendo. You can't hear the percussion notes at all in the intro of this song on the Definitive Edition. Terrible!<br /><br />So when I got this set and I first listened to them I felt like I was hearing a brand new recording! I heard flute passages on Nursery Cryme that I never even knew existed, could clearly hear the oboe passage in Can-Utility And The Coastliners, the beautiful intro to The Fountain Of Salmacis, and finally heard Peter's voice effects like they were meant to be heard.<br /><br />You never would have heard any of this material as it was meant to be heard when it was new because of the ghastly quality of the analog tape machines that all of these albums were recorded with way back when. But now, with all the advances in digital audio technology, we can finally hear everything on these albums as God intended. It is for this reason that I love these songs even more now than the first time I heard them.<br /><br />And aside from the stellar audio quality, they finally got the packaging right.<br />All of the original album artwork is present in the cover booklet to each album.<br />Nothing is missing, even the colors of the artwork are brighter and more vibrant!<br /><br />Not to mention the fact that each album comes with a bonus DVD that presents each album in DVD-Audio, with the choice of DTS or Dolby Digital 5.1. Audio. They even threw in a bonus disc that contains some of their finest unreleased songs, and a bonus DVD that has an extensive documentary that chronicles the history of the band. It comes packaged in a nice sleeve that has a cool booklet complete with vintage photos of the band members, the most interesting of which shows Peter donning the flower mask from Supper's Ready, the old man from the Musical Box, the fox in the red dress from the cover of the Foxtrot album, and the slipperman from The Colony Of Slippermen.<br /><br />The bonus DVDs also include brand new full length interviews where each band member offers their feelings and recollections on the making of each album.<br />Additionally, the DVDs contain many of the band's super rare European television performances, complete with all the neon lights and Peter wearing his outlandish face paint, masks, and costumes, and in-between song patter. These guys really know their stuff. They are all hard working, extremely talented musicians who have made amazing music in their youth and have continued that tradition since.<br /><br />If you already own older copies of these albums and absolutely love them, you should take this set into serious consideration. Especially if you don't already own them.  The huge difference in sound quality, the original album art, and all the bonus materials make it worth every penny!
B0006J28MI|5.0|We love it. Took awhile to get here. And was out of the locking, but in good shape. Thanks so much.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Having a book hangover. John Green really knows how to capture his readers through individualistic portrayal of unique characters. Can't wait for more john green
B0074QGGK6|5.0|My English teacher read a little of this once and I was astonished when I found out I could get it for $1.99. It helped me so much with seeing things clearly. Now I believe in myself 100000000001% more. This book spoke to me and I understood everything it said. Definitely recommend this for an aspiring artist or just anyone who likes using their imagination.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|Of course, EVERY film has it's flaws so I won't go into what I thought they were with this film. Suffice it to say that I did NOT purchase this film when it 1st came to DVD/BluRay but only recently, NOT because it took me this long to realice that I liked it, but because I'd seen it again on one of the premium channels and remembered that it was my favorite release the year it hit theaters. Prequels can be screwed up just as much as Remakes, but this one engaged me from the onset and built up a nice tale on through to completion. All I can say is it was A Great Story Well Told.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|To me, this is Kamelot's masterpiece. Set in Victorian England, \\"Silverthorn\\" is the story of how a family fell into disaster after the death of their daughter, Jolee, and the guilt of her twin brothers. Some time after this incident, every family member mysteriously dies, presumably by the hand of one of the twins. However, one must know the concept and pay attention to the lyrics to know the truth of this story.<br /><br />Tommy Karevik's vocals are powerful; the symphony and melodies are amazing. Some are more striking than others, but the album is made of pure awesomeness. \\"Sacrimony (Angel of Afterlife)\\", \\"My Confession\\" and \\"Falling Like the Fahrenheit\\" are my personal favorites.<br /><br />With many memorable moments, it begins with a calm but rising piano ballad, \\"Manus Dei\\", that culminates in \\"Sacrimony (Angel of Afterlife)\\", a fast paced, powerful song that uses a nice tenor, soprano and guttural vocal combo, with bonus points as the guttural is female. Follows up with \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", which reminds me of the \\"Ghost Opera\\" era, and \\"Torn\\".<br /><br />The breathtaking ballad \\"Song for Jolee\\" sets the stage and contrasts with the following \\"Veritas\\", one of the few songs from the evil twin Robert's perspective, and \\"My Confession\\", symbolizing the unnamed protagonist's guilt and desire to repent. These two are the absolute Moment of Awesome of this album.<br /><br />\\"Falling Like the Fahrenheit\\" is slower, but gripping, and soon after \\"Silverthorn\\" (which is crucial to the story) and \\"Solitaire\\" we have 7 min of epic rocking finale, \\"Prodigal Son\\", followed by the simple, yet haunting \\"Continuum\\".<br /><br />Sadly none of these versions doesn't include the bonus tracks \\"Leaving Too Soon\\" (Japan exclusive) and \\"Welcome Home\\" (exclusive for a Swedish magazine), although you may find them online for a complete view of the concept. Both are great songs. The instrumental CD has a bonus vocal track, \\"Grace\\".<br /><br />If you're in doubt whether to get this or not, I strongly suggest watching the videoclips of \\"Sacrimony (Angel of Afterlife)\\" and \\"My Confession\\" on Kamelot's official YouTube channel.<br /><br />I bought the Limited Edition set. The Digipak comes with a nice storybook detailing the concept behind the album, along with some concept images. It's very well written and worth the read. Some blogs posted it online in case you get the regular edition. The second CD is instrumental with some background vocals, sadly I would've liked pure instrumentals better. Still, it was definitely worth my hype.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Great product, makes charcoal much more convenient. The handle was slightly bent when received probably due to shipping but it does not effect the overall use of the product.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This story took in in for the ride and I enjoyed every minute of it. What a fantastical tale. If you love fantasy I recomend this book and all the others in the series.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|takes a few episodes  to get going, but once it does, you will in it for the long run, so make sure you got the cash to purchase season 2.
B007HO392S|5.0|My wife got me to listen to Carrie at one of her shows on this current tour. This girl is a bonaifide superstar regardless of genre. I have no respect for Singers who don't write their own material. So she checks the box of that one too. Carries knocks it out of the park on this one. Signed, Still Rock'in past 60
B003TTKB5I|5.0|Got hooked on watching Grey's on Lifetime...but they show only 2 shows a day and when I get a chance to see it, they are usually episodes I have already seen.  I looked on Amazon to see if they had the seasons and THEY DO!!  So I'm trying to catch up and I really LOVE the show.  I don't know why I didn't watch it way in the beginning...I honestly think it is because of all the hype and I didn't want to get caught up in it.  My bad!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I have purchased the entire set of Spartacus. That's how much I enjoyed it. It's gory though and has a lot of sex type scenes. Not for kids.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|best show on TV. dont buy it if you cant watch season 3 because it will just torture your brain for the rest of your days
B000UZNSWM|5.0|This book was extremely well researched with a balance of the military/political and human interest. It is very relevant for today's debate over the use of infantry versus drone strikes. My only regret is that I cannot reach out to thank many of the individuals named for their military service. However, David Halberstam insured their actions would be recognized and remembered.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|Waiting for the new season, this was great. Even with the fear the Grey's Anatomy may be seeing it day with the possible last season, having these past episodes gives us all a chance to enjoy the talent of some great actors and wonderful writing that has kept us tied to Seattle Grace. I was told by my anatomy and physiology instructor, watch as many medical shows as this to gain a better knowledge of the medical world, but I am sure and I hope, without all the sex put in to keep you interested. I will miss this show, but I am so thankful that an option as this is available to keep my need for Grey Anatomy alive.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Should have listen to other comments. The game goes to fast, you make too many mistakes because your finger  touch the wrong numbers. When you try to correct, the caller is already called out more numbers. You need some kind of pointer. I was out of points so soon and needed to buy before you knew it. Not very happy with this game so far.....
B00CH26TL8|4.0|its a fun game altho i dont understand all of the buying extras or magic tricks or what not. but you can play and enjoy the game without all the extras
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I loved this program when it first aired. My sisters and I would faithfully watch it every week on Masterpiece Theater on channel 11. I will never forget that. So glad amazon had this available so I could watch it again. Jean Marsh is great as Rose. Always liked her as an actress. Would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Upstairs Downstairs back in the 1970's when it first aired. British living in the 1900's for wealthy families was always fun to see for me.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|A very funny take on Pride and Prejudice. Jane Austen fans will love this and enjoy the opportunity to see some familiar P&P characters in a new light. A unique spin on a classic.
0783230079|5.0|Watch this with the kids...do not preview it, let it all be a surprise.  A real &#34;feel good&#34; movie.Thank me later.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|This is exactly what I thought it would be. I spent 23 years using the military canteen and cup and can honestly say, I like this better.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Good premise but after several hundred pages, the story was very redundant. Lets face it, how many times can you read about zombies eating people. The story could have been several hundred pages shorter and conveyed the message. As it was, the story was greatly bogged down by redundancy.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Reminded me of our government and the majority of our politicians and there is nothing we can do about it except term limits.
B008NMT684|5.0|My grandson absolutely loves this app.  He always asks to play it. His shape recognition has improved greatly. He can do every puzzle by himself and he is two years old!
B005544V6A|4.0|Good show. Fast paced and fairly crisp conversations. Not fully practical, but its a TV show - So just enjoy it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very mind working at times. Wish it was a longer game before having to rate but this is a good game. Really a mind bottled at times.
B0014QABX0|3.0|The first fee songs were good but I could not get into the rest of the album. Not very inspiring.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This car charger will charge your iPhone 5 at Apple's recommended power requirements. While there are several that will do this and a couple of others that will also provide power to a second device at the same time, what differes in in the engineering.<br /><br />The Anker will charge TWO devices independantly of one another - i.e. 2.4A for your iPhone/iPod AND 2.0A for Android/Blackberry/other device. As of this review, it is the only one I've found that will do this.<br /><br />Earlier this year, I pruchased the PowerGen for my wife's iPhone. While it is a great charger, the output is split between the two devices. When my wife chargers her iPhone, it is charged at 2A. If I were to add my company issued Blackberry to the other port, the 2A is shared between the two devices.<br /><br />I have recommended this product to friends and collegues who need reliable, fast charging for their iDevice and another USB device in their car.
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|I used to play HOMM3 many hours a day back in the good old days.  I was worried that I would think this version was tired and sappy.  I bought it because of the fond memories and the low price.  But it's aged very well.  I am ecstatic that I bought it because it's just as much fun as it ever was!  I am unable to review HOMM4 because I'm so obsessed with 3 that I haven't even tried 4.
0439023513|5.0|My son read the series & enjoyed it a lot. I went with him to see the 1st movie & we both enjoyed it. I'm not sure if it's ok for sensitive kids but my son is an average 11 year old boy who loves to read & he finished this book in 2 days.
B002R5LKOQ|4.0|The movie was really enjoyable and picture was clear with no lines, or ridges like those bootleg movies. Very good quality.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I was drawn to Macklemore's music initially when I began to listen to current dance and club music. I purchased it for the more popular cuts heard in Top 40 pop, but the more I listen the more impressed I am with this man's artistry and message. The lyrics can be raw and gritty and force the listener to think more deeply than most music of this era and genre. If you are scratching below the surface of today's music, this is a must have CD
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Very helpful for school I found it very useful and very organized, I love this app and I recommend it so get this note app instead of the others!
B009LQKHIO|3.0|After suffering an infernal marriage and losing her brother due to a crash accident, Megan is in the town of Pride trying to heal. There she meets a loving family of two brothers and a sister that immediately take her under their care. The Jordans used to be close to her brother, Matt, they were frequently at his house and shared business projects with him.<br /><br />As you can expect she finds herself attracted to Todd, the oldest of the Jordans, a widower with a nice body and an interesting personality. Their relationship is typical for a romance, at first she refuses to let him in but finally gives in and the passion unleashes.<br /><br />The characters are good; they have defined personalities and seem real. Megan is a woman who has suffered a lot; she had to go through imaginable things and has lived really hard situations. Raised by her brother, she ended up in an abusive marriage. Her pain feels real and when she talks about it you can sense the anguish so in general her character and her story are great and believable.<br /><br />Todd is another story, he is supposed to be the perfect man, the knight that comes to her rescue but his personality is not the best and fails a lot. For me he has serious jealousy issues, I mean he can't even stand to see his brother talking to Megan. And there were a lot of his attitudes that I couldn't like or understand.<br /><br />Lacey and Iian were my favorites besides Megan, they are adorable, caring and I can see them as future leading characters.<br /><br />As any adult romance it has some scenes with a high temperature. These are great; they are believable, with a perfect timing and a good progression. These moments serve to see a tender and sweet side of Todd.<br /><br />The book has a fast rhythm in general, good writing and a loving setting. My only complain about the story would be the ending, it was way too predictable. I don't want to spoil anything but if you are an observant reader you will figure things before they happen.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to those who like romance and believe in a lifetime love.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The story line was a little better than the first book. Could do without all the porn but then there would only be about thirty pages in the book. LOL Christian is still fascinating!
B00ECUARO8|5.0|I really liked this movie alot and would say if you haven't seen it yet you better run out and get it.
B007T99ENE|3.0|The plot doesn't quite ring true, it all seems  bit unlikely . Found it a bit slow, I almost lost interest. Cold war propaganda plots and minor spies operate in sixties UK, somewhat pointlessly seemingly.
034580404X|3.0|But definitely wasn't the greatest. After hearing all the hype about these books, I decided I would read them for myself. I found myself quickly pulled into Ana and Christian's relationship and the events that followed. I enjoyed the action and mystery that unfolded, but had to skim over and skip one too many pages because of some of the repetitious sexual encounters. I'm not necessarily adverse to reading sex scenes, but they quickly get old once they're in almost every single chapter. I was more interested in finding out what really happened to Christian when he was younger, the mystery and history of Leila and Mrs. Robinson, the evil plots of Jack Hyde....I really couldn't put the book down, hoping there would be much more to the story.<br /><br />In the end, though I enjoyed the romance and plot, I felt like there was still more left to be desired from the trilogy. I felt like there were more pages of repetitive, steamy sex than actual story. I felt the books just didn't do the whole plot justice. I was expecting more trauma to Christian's childhood (not that it wasn't traumatic), more details revealed about Leila and Mrs. Robinson, and more evil twists from Jack Hyde.<br /><br />At the end of the third book, I did read excerpts of Christian's first Christmas and the first meeting with Ana via Christian's perspective. I am looking forward to reading these when they are released, hoping these books will give me more of the action and mystery that I was looking for.
B002361MLA|4.0|Brilliantly coherent and humbling. A real whack to the side of the head. I will probably spend many years working hard at becoming more present. What is my next thought? Best exercise to illustrate the difference between my mind and I.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Never mind that this is the greatest comic hero movie series ever made... and no that is not debatable, Dwight! Never mind that it was only 30 bucks for all three awesome movies of blue ray awesomeness... yeah its a word, the real power of this purchase experience is that it was here only one sleep after I ordered it thanks to free 2 day shipping through my Prime account.<br />the product if you can call it merely a product, arrived swiftly and was exactly what it advertised along with a christmas like anticipation for its arrival, come on, admit it, every time the doorbell rings and you see that its a package for you, its like coming down and finding those cookies you left out half eaten for the jolly man. joy brought with batman. I am tearing up a little here guys. buy this and you too may enjoy the level of Zen that comes with this small package.
B008PQ8XZK|4.0|The book gets off to a memorable start which makes you want to keep reading. The characters were interesting and believable and the atmosphere of war time London a great backdrop to a very good mystery yarn. Very readable.
B004EWEX9Y|1.0|Brief and to the point, bought it plugged it to my I pad 2 and only got sound, no video at all. Set it up on another tv same thing only sound. If you spend $40 bucks for something, and it didn't work as it should would you be happy about it.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|its a really fun game to play once I'm on it I cant get of it!  but... when its  loading it freezes my kindle then it wont turn on?  is it just my kindle or...?
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is the third novel I have read, by Hosseini. I am always truck by how dynamic, volatile, and courageous the characters in his novels are.<br />This book (although fictional) brings life to the everyday people of Afghanistan.  It allows one to see the human&#34; loving, and diverse side to a people that is not well documented in western culture.  I enjoyed the characters in this book...how courageous they were, there faults, there humanness!  I enjoy this author books so much.!  Definitely Will recommend to friends and family.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It was a Book Club selection.  A few of the ladies thought it was slow at the beginning.  Then, as you got into the story, you couldn't put it down.  I liked Amy.  However, it certainly wasn't a novel that had you identify with any of the characters.
B005ZI306S|5.0|An entertaining read for me and my son, and a bargain at the price! Well worth the small investment, not disappointed in the least!
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|its a really stupid game it really boring u dont get to do very much and when I try to brush her hair down it wont let me do it all the way and when I cut her hair I just want to cut a lil piece and it cuts all of the hair and its very hard to control the supplies. it really sucks.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Everything I expected it to be.  Charges quickly, easy to use and saves USB port from wear and tear. Great product.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I choose this rating because, it was AMAZING!!!!<br />It is now one of my favorite books of all time! Except for<br />Out of my mind ;)<br />One part that I didn't really like was when it was a little slow in the middle. But it got REALLY good right after that.<br />I would recommend this book to someone who likes: romance,adventures,and the Cinderella story.
B004N0I3U2|4.0|This was a typical bond film. Evil villains want to do evil, hot evil woman, hot good woman, tons of innuendo, Bond saves the day when all looks lost. It was a good reboot to the series and I liked Pierce Brosnan as James Bond.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|this is one of the best card games on kindle fire,  gameloft did a great job on this game.  the game is really easy to play and master
B003SPCYP8|5.0|My Name is Khan is a powerful and emotionally driven film.  It is a story about love, dissappointment and the ultimate depiction of man's inhumanity to man.
B004SBULWE|4.0|The Advanced Task Killer is easy to use and it extends the life of the battery on my tablet.It allows me to shut down those apps that continue to run in the background. It has proved to be a good app for me.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Got mine from back order last week and I must say, I'm quite impressed. The ease of use is astonishing. Some people claimed problems setting this up with an iOS device, I had no problem whatsoever setting this up with my iPhone and then linking it to my tablets, desktop and laptop. No matter what I'm doing I can throw a browser window on the screen, whats more - if it's something like HBO GO, I can just hit the maximize button and it looks perfect on the tv (No frames or borders).<br />One problem I did have was based on the bandwidth of my router. I suggest a dual channel if you're going to stream a browser window. Run the computer off of the 5 ghz and the Chromecast will pick up the lower frequency. Once I replaced my router I had zero lag issues.<br /><br />All in all a great product and easily portable.
B000NY12LO|4.0|A good, interesting story that hopefully exaggerates the bullying problems in schools but nevertheless paints a good picture of the pain it can cause.
0345803485|5.0|This was by far the best book series I have ever read! I cannot wait for her next series!!<br />The books were shipped promptly.
B00ARA4SLU|3.0|Hitchcock is an intriguing piece that is worth taking a look at. Since the film took place during the time period of the making of Psycho a story inspired by the famous serial killer Ed Gein, it was quite fitting and an inventive subplot to have Hitchcock gain his own inspiration from the man himself throughout the film. It was also a good way to delve into the psyche of the genius filmmaker who was somewhat disturbed in his own right. Hopkins and Mirren give a stellar performance with their portrayal of Hitchcock and his wife Alma.  The film seems to do a good job showing both the working and personal dynamic between Hitchcock and his wife. It's debatable of how much of that is accurate and how much of it is contrived.<br /><br />Two great scenes that stand out in the movie; is the one where the shower scene is being filmed and Hitch shows his eccentric style by getting the actors to put on the performance he envisions. The second is where he finds grains of sand on his bathroom floor, evidence that his wife Alma had been spending too much time with her friend at the beach.<br /><br />As many good qualities this film has it seems to fall short on others. Perhaps this film would have been stronger if it went more in depth into the filming process of Psycho which is essentially what the story is about.  The subplot between Hitch and his wife is interesting however it might have taken away from actually showing the making of his finest masterpiece.  Overall Hitchcock is entertaining with a few surprises but for a true purest this film might be disappointing.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera is amazing! One of favorite musicals and this movie gave justice to that. The scenes were perfectly panned out as well as the numbers and chorus. The settings was majestic especially on how they portrayed the theater. I would highly recommend this movie.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Factual, intriguing, could not  put it down and wonderfully written!<br />Another Ken Follett masterpiece!<br />Thank you, you have opened another part of the world to me!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|A story with a tragic beginning turns I to a beautiful story of love and courage.  A must read!  You will fall in love with little Jack and Ma.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Never knew much about this man, until i read this book it sure stimulates ideas and my interests as to what happen to many of his inventions. Great short story. Would love to read more about his works.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|High quality construction, easy to use.  I go on a lot of week-long backpacking and canoeing trips, and having this along twice this summer allowed me to continute to photograph the last several days of each trip that otherwise would have been met with dead camera and iphone batteries.  Thanks for a great product, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who will be out of range of an AC charging station.  BTY, it says that the iPhone 5 adapter is not included, but you just use your iphone 5/USB charger cord and do not need an adaptor.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|I know many complained about her going on 3-4 hours late but it was worth the wait and now I can't wait for the Blu-Ray to re-live the most amazing concert I had ever been to!
B007B5EDEG|5.0|Amazingly epic saga, detailing a time long ago. emmensely involved but never boring. Martin makes you feel like you are part of the seven kingdoms.  Best Ive ever read!! Never want it to end.
B00338QENI|5.0|The book was absolutely amazing, the only parts I continuously feel asleep on were the medical chapters but other then that the book was nice
B000022TSH|5.0|This movie has it all. Great acting, dialog, directing, action, mystery, and a kicker at the end. It deserves the kudos it received.
