0345509617|3.0|I've been enjoying this book very much, particularly for the transcripts and interviews done with the principals as the film was in production; all of this, in conjunction with the photos and illustrations, has been a fascinating insight into the production of \\"The Empire Strikes Back.\\" 4 stars for the content! But 2 stars for the book as an object. It's designed as a massive coffee table book, rather than something readable. It's huge, heavy and difficult to read unless you enjoy hunching over a table--it's too large even to read comfortably on one's lap while sitting in a chair. If you're buying it to leaf through and look at the photos, it's fine, but to read, not so much. I'd love a digital version of this book (Kindle for iPad, perhaps)--as that would make it vastly more readable.
B0000041DZ|5.0|I am writing this review on 5 January 2011, the very day of Alfred Brendel's 80th anniversary.     I think there are no other composers dearer to his heart and more suitable to his style than Beethoven and Schubert. Maybe Haydn's humorous subtexts or Mozart's floating cantabiles could appeal Brendel's musical interests at a comparable extent as - and come close to - his fondness of serving Beethoven and Schubert. However, these four giants of the Viennese Classicism have long been his four aces so that Brendel's reputation owes them its most consistent part. Therefore it is not a surprise that he recorded the complete cycle of Beethoven sonatas no less than three times, each at a different age, in a constantly ascendant development as a performing artist.     An always-elegant touch and a very subtle insight helped Brendel - during a longish career, spanning 60 years on stage - give benchmark renditions of those giants' masterpieces to be cherished by his large number of admirers.  If one adds the flattering title of \\"thinker at the piano\\", earned from worldwide audiences and critics alike, this could explain the top position Alfred Brendel secured for himself among the contemporary pianists. His erudition overlapped his keen sensitivity and infallible musical intuitions, as to supply a seductively witty, serene, perfumed style of playing. So personal, though scrupulously rigorous with regard to the score.      This recorded cycle of complete Beethoven sonatas dates from Brendel's full maturity, being recorded and released in the first half of the 1990s, a period of great achievements in his artistic life. His legendary classical poise is nowhere better highlighted than here, in his last recorded traversal of Beethoven sonatas. Each of the 10 CD asserts for his conception. According to it a masterpiece should not be forced to mould the performer's obsessions or affinities - instead the performer has to find its essence and look for both the closest empathy with composer's intentions and the most natural re-thinking the score in its own terms. Otherwise, the masterpiece can well be considered betrayed. Any interpretation should remain within this ineffable contour and serve the truths of the piece. It is exactly what Brendel achieves here. In a magisterially refined manner!    Guided by Alfred Brendel, immersing in the all-embracing inner world of Beethoven becomes a pure delight!
B003UBTX72|3.0|First, the formatting in the Kindle edition is questionable.  Each time he has someone else write a passage, the entire paragraph is indented.  However, if the guest-writer has a 2nd paragraph, the formatting reverts to KR's prose, and so it becomes unclear who is writing.  That is my lone criticism of the formatting and appearance.    As for the content, the first chapter is wildly spectacular, telling of a run-in with the law, while in a car riddled with narcotics.  I suspected there would be more of this.  There wasn't.      Richards runs off on many tangents, telling stories of people that have had very little affect on his life, or this book.  Many of these should have been omitted outright.    It is obvious where his passions lay.  When he writes about things of great interest, his passion leaps off the e-page.  Drugs, music, writing, love.  He then appears to have been forced to write other topics and the boredom comes through clear to the reader - family life growing up, Mick Jagger, the aforementioned stories on a tangent, etc.    He also downplays a lot of what happened.  This is a shame, because his experiences could come out as highly entertaining, or prove as a life lesson to the reader.  He downplays what happened in the 1970's in Toronto (as a Canadian, it is a story of legend, and is also why the Stones prepare for all their tours in Toronto, and always do a free show prior to the tour).  He downplays his drug-induced antics and in fact, makes it almost seem glamourous.  Don't get me wrong, he states several times \\"don't try this\\" but at the same time, that didn't leap out with conviction.    There is so much more that could have come out of this book, it just seemed to be missing the grandiose nature of what it is like being a Rolling Stone.
B00005ARDC|4.0|San Francisco based band's debut is very good.  This band sounded like a cross of Jesus And the Mary Chain and the Stone Roses.  Robert Turner (AKA Robert Levon Been) is the leader of this 3 man band.  Robert is the son of The Call's, Michael Been.  On this album they rocked on \\"Love Burns\\", \\"Red Eyes And Tears\\", \\"Whatever Happened To My Rock 'n Roll (Punk Song)\\", \\"White Palms\\", the anthem \\"Spread Your Love\\" and the timeless \\"Salvation\\".  A very good debut.  The second album would be a slight slip to this one.

B00007KWHP|5.0|\\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" is a notable accomplishment and delivers some ecstasy at the right time and place and in the right mood.  I love the beginning (fast part) of Long Distance...and \\"Roundabout\\" with Bill Bruford is my favorite song of all time (Genesis The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway is second).      I've seen people write to disparage Jon Anderson's voice and I absolutely can't understand it.  They also panned Geddy Lee, so I think they show their own ignorance.  Both these men have voices that are easily in the top ten of rock: 1. Peter Gabriel, 2. Sting, 3. Anderson, 4. McCartney, 5. Lee.  Fiona Apple?  Is she rock?  MJ, Houston, Mitchell, Joel are tops in Pop.  Am I missing anyone?  Hannah Montana?  Mariah Carey sucks, I'm sorry. (It's just my opinion.) (Justin Timberlake is justin not my thing.)  Robert Plant? Naw
B000NA28I4|1.0|Worst Movie Ever Made!<br />Need I say more?<br />Nope.<br /><br />Oh yeah, don't buy it and don't even attempt to watch this.<br />I regret buying this. I want my $5 back!
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I was really surprised when I opened this dvd set. Even though I don't like slim dvd cases, the art of this Community box made me forget that. It is dressed as Jeff's Yearbook, with really funny notes from the main characters of the show. It also comes with an edition of the Kickpuncher, written by Troy, also amusing. Besides that, the dvds are full of extras, with extended episodes, outtakes and more. Something that I found interesting were the first season cast evaluations. I didn't have the opportunity to watch all of them, but simply the idea is, for me, genial!  As for the show, it surely is one of the best comedy series I have ever watched. However, not everybody will like it. I don't consider Community's humor as a universal humor. So, before buying it, make sure you watch one or two episodes and really like it. If you do, come to Amazon and buy this dvd set. You won't regret.
B000JIJPZY|3.0|We received this gym mat for free, and it was worth every penny!    Though our son liked lying on his back and looking at the various dangling parts of this gym mat, he is outgrowing it fairly quickly.  The musical ball is nice because the music is not annoying.  However, I am not sure that a baby could spin the ball fast enough to activate it by himself.  Once a baby becomes more mobile, his arms flail out beyond the soft part of the mat toward the hard plastic edges.      A bigger mat will last a longer time and offer more stimuli for the baby.
B002ZG980U|4.0|Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Page star in this 2010 sci-fi film.   A thief tries redeeming himself by planting ideas into dreams   of others rather than stealing them. This is interesting and   Leo's great as usual. This dvd has good picture and sound   plus a neat 4-part making-of featurette. I recommend this.
B002T9H2L0|2.0|This is a five star movie but the release is very poor.  This is a ONE disc set.  Sure, there's two discs in the package but only one of them is useful.  The \\"digital copy\\" is expired as of 1/1/11.  I just got mine and tried to download my copy to no avail!  So, buy it if you want a copy of the movie on BluRay.  It looks and sounds great!  And, this is a fantastic film by Tarrantino who continues to mature as a filmmaker.  For me, the movie seemed odd at first but on subsequent viewings I find myself drawn in further.  Some of the scenes with The Jew Hunter are going to be classics, especially the first one - so much tension!<br /><br />I haven't viewed the Special Features, but they seemed pretty sparse.  There's no commentary, even.  So, this is a not very special edition.  Like many BluRay releases, look for this to have a reissue in a couple years in a \\"collector's edition\\" or something so they can bleed us for a little more cash.
1401322336|4.0|I have to admit, I resisted Jamie Oliver's charms vigorously over the years, but after watching his Food Revolution show where he attempts to upgrade the British School versions of school lunches in both nutrition and flavor, I came to realize that he is one celebrity chef who really cares about food. I find myself thinking like him, or how I believe he thinks with regard to every aspect of my meals and how they came about.  For instance, do I want a sandwich made with Wonder Bread, or, would I prefer to make my sandwich with the wide variety of freshly baked loaves from a local bakery where, not only do they provide  better taste and nutrition, they are not made with additives and preservatives that make bread last for two weeks?  I choose the latter.  So....I bought this book, and I have to say that I have enjoyed it.  Though, as of now, I have only actually made two recipes in this book, both have turned out very well.  For years, I avoided making steaks at home, until recently when I tried Jamie's version of prime rib steak with rosemary potatoes.  Afterwards, I felt like I had eaten at a 5-star restaurant!  It was a lovely meal and was all the more satisfying to know that I had prepared it myself.  A televised review of this book gave him credit for having a picture of every recipe inside and I suppose that helps folks to visualize the end results, but, for me it is helpful but not necessary.  I have also made his shortbread recipe and that turned out quite good as well.  Jamie's european background sometimes takes some getting used to from the standpoint of a North American-some of the terminology and names of items must be translated, but, all-in-all, this is an excellent book for both reference and recipes.  Lastly,  I have to say that there is something about the British sense of humor, or, humour, that comes across vividly in Jamie Oliver's shows and cookbooks that I love dearly.
B001UV4XFQ|5.0|I will always tell people that the Twilight books are MUCH better than the movies, but the movies are getting better and better.  I won't go through the movie ad nauseum, but rather tell you about the features that make the Blu-Ray/DVD combo great:    1)  I can watch the movie anywhere in the house.  We have a Blu-Ray player downstairs but not upstairs.  I'm stuck watching Twilight and New Moon on the cold leather sofa in the living room, but I can watch Eclipse upstairs in a warm comfy bed.  Bonus.    2)  I'm a dork for behind-the-scenes documentaries.  I love seeing how a movie is made, and the extra interviews you see with the cast and crew.  For the teenage girls who are Team Jacob, they even have special featurettes called \\"Taylor Time\\" where he's basically looking hot and doing adorable stuff, like catching grapes in his mouth and throwing a football over set trailers.  Good times.    3)  The extra and extended scenes are great, and honestly I don't understand or agree with the rationalization given for why they were cut.  Stephanie Meyer and Wyck Godfrey also discuss some of these cut scenes in their audio commentary.    4)  The audio commentary features are always enlightening, although they can be distracting if you're trying to pay attention to the movie.  I enjoyed the Stephanie Meyer/Wyck Godfrey commentary alot.  The Kristen Stewart/Rob Pattinson audio commentary, not so much.  Surprise!  If you are a younger fan, you may enjoy it alot more, but to me it felt like being the awkward third wheel on a date with them.  They are openly joking and flirting and I could only stand it for 5 minutes and had to turn it off.  I will definitely try it again soon, but I will have a bottle of wine nearby.    5)  Finally I LOVED that I didn't have to sit or fast forward through 3-4 movie trailers before getting to the DVD menu.      The two music videos are great (Metric's \\"I'm All Yours\\" and Muse's \\"Neutron Star Collision\\").  The photo slideshow is sorta silly, and Ididn't use the feature where you can skip to your favorite scenes, so can't comment on that.  All in all, this was the best DVD set up so far of all the Twilight movies.
B00005KARK|5.0|Dumbo (60th Anniversary Edition) is one Disney's true classic animated movies. The story is about a small elephant who is born with big ears and then shunned by the rest of the circus for being different. The scene \\"Baby Mine\\" is one that brings a tear to ones eye and yes I admit I cried during that scene. The animation is amazing and the storyline is just as good as other classics such as Pinocchio, Cinderella and Snow white and the seven dwarfs. This movie will be enjoyed by generations of children for come as the message is ever green. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.
B003KUSUG8|3.0|I do not want to come across like I'm hating, because Eminem is one of my favorite rappers, but Recovery is his third strike, he fell off....hard.    We gave Eminem a break because on Encore Eminem was obviously on drugs (See: \\"Ass Like That\\" and \\"Big Weenie\\"), and aparently, according to \\"Talkin 2 Myself\\" he was 'flushin em out' on Relapse.  While Eminem does appear sober on Recovery, it is my least favorite of his albums.  Out of his entire catalogue, Recovery sticks out like a sore thumb and this can be attributed to the drugs messing his head up, or more likely that he made this album for the fans and gave them what he thought they wanted rather than what he wanted to put out (Relapse 2).  Never before has Eminem had to resort to Young Money style punchlines like \\"I'm standing on my Monopoly board, that means I'm on top of my game!\\" to make up for his lack of lyrical ability and wit.  The song Won't Back Down for example is nothing more than a deluge of corny punchlines being thrown at us.  Everything about this album almost sounds forced unlike his previous albums where everything just slid right off of his mind onto the song.    What makes the album even worse is Eminem's constant, incessant, eardrum-shattering new delivery of screaming his verses out at the top of his lungs.  Music is supposed to be pleasing to the ears and his new delivery is anything but pleasing and makes it very grating and difficult to get through the entire album without an earache.  Contrary to what Eminem may think, screaming does not equal emotion on the track.    There are two (good) standouts on the album. 1. Cold Wind Blows.  He is using his screaming delivery to the maximum, but it's not too bad because it's only the first track and it hasn't wore down anybodies ears at this point.  This is the only track that when I listen to it, it reminds me of old Slim Shady....the track just seems less forced and more 'old school Eminem'.  The second standout track is Going Through Changes that starts out with a great Ozzy sample and leads into the verse.  This song on a lyrical level is somewhere near perfect technically and is a lot like Deja Vu from Relapse.  It's real and the lyrics are very meaningful.  Deja Vu was about Eminem's experience on drugs whereas Going Through Changes is more centered around his triumph over drugs.  Both very great songs.    So all in all, very very average album.  Unless Eminem can pull one more extremely amazing album he should just quit now before his legacy of greatness is damaged even more.
B00003CX9W|5.0|Fantasia being the 3rd animated movie by the Dinsey Studio is an experimental movie that mixes the animation from 8 classical works. The movie is very experimental and at the same time a classic work that can be enjoyed both by adults and children alike. The music is played by Philadelphia Orchestra and conducted by Leopold Stokowski. In the movie we get to hear Bach, Beethoven and Stravinski to mention a few. Fantasia is grand work of animation art and each scene is painted painstakingly by hand. I wish I could give it more then 5 stars but as it is I give it a 5+. 5/5.

1439153663|5.0|It is 1791 and Lavinia McCarten only remembers being handed from a white man to a black man and hearing instructions to:  \\"Give her to Belle.  She's hers for the kitchen\\" and looking up to see a huge clapboard house that was painted white and had an enormous porch framing the entire length of the front of the house.  Belle worked in the kitchen house as a cook for the Pyke family.<br /><br />Lavinia, almost seven-years-old had been taken from a ship coming from Ireland after her parents both died and her brother, Cardigan, was sold.  She was a frail girl who vomited up all food and liquid she was fed but with Belle's persistence Lavinia was soon eating and feeling well.  Now living on a large tobacco plantation she grows up part of the black slave families.  Mama Mae, Belle, Ben, Pappa, Dory, Fanny, Beattie and a whole slew of other characters who all take her under their wing and come to love her as if she was their own.  The call her Abinia and the black children become her brother's and sister's.<br /><br />Captain Pyke and his wife have two children themselves, four-year-old Sally and eleven-year-old Marshall who Lavinia will someday get to know better than she had ever anticipated.  One day all the children are playing and Marshall being a rather outspoken boy with a nasty, violent streak pushes his sister Sally too hard on the swing and she ends up dying!  Of course  Marshall blamed Ben, one of the black slaves and he was about to be hung until Belle pleaded with Marshall to tell the truth that he had in fact pushed Sally off the swing.  Marshall was silent own defense and only with Belle's pleading that they were going to kill Ben did Lavinia blurt out that Marshall had done it.<br /><br />As the story goes on it alternates being told both by Lavinia and Belle which was an awesome way to tell this particular story and important for reasons you'll see when you've read the book yourself.  Marshall becomes a more and more sinister and violent young man who grows into an even more abhorrent adult and the troubles Lavinia suffers through as well as all the black slaves, derives from or through Marshall.<br /><br />The violence, the action, the drama, the fast pace will keep you glued to the edge of your seat.  I read and read and read and read late into each night for two nights until I'd finished and then was sorry I read it so quickly.  This is one novel I hope and pray the ghosts of the past pester Ms. Grissom to pen a sequel.<br /><br />Excellent, excellent debut novel!

Highly recommended from my perspective.
B003EVFHYG|5.0|I purchased this soundtrack for my 10-year old who has absolutely fallen in love with the book series and the movie.  He's recently taken up drawing dragons and collecting dragons.  Needless to say, \\"How to Train Your Dragon\\" has really gotten him into all things dragons!  He is also a fan of soundtracks (think Harry Potter, Star Wars, etc.)  and I'm absolutely thrilled that he has an appreciation for such music.  It was no surprise when he asked for this soundtrack. Our favorite is \\"Forbidden Friendship\\".  It was great to hear a song \\"Sticks and Stones\\" that wasn't so pop...but it fit the movie.  We love this soundtrack--makes you wish you could ride a dragon around the little Isle of Berk!  A better price than iTunes!

It's a fun and refreshing style of writing and presentation of history in a location rarely discussed.

B004G6009K|5.0|I'm a male in his 20's, and in my opinion this is one of the best animation movies Disney has put out in quite a while.

By the way, Tangled is a much better film than Princess and the Frog could ever dream to be, that film was so boring...
B0042JTDXK|2.0|If you really like Josh Groban, do not listen to this CD. Your opinion of him will plummet ad mine did. It is a huge departure from his other work. I understand the concept of trying new things, but this should not have been attempted.<br /><br />Each song sounded like the one before it. Josh has quite a vocal range, but the majority of this CD seemed to all be in the upper 1/3. There's only so much falsetto that one can endure in a single sitting.<br /><br />My wife put this on her Christmas list. I think that if she previewed the tracks, she would have changed her mind.<br /><br />Sorry Josh.
B0039208CG|5.0|Batman Forever (1995) starring Val Kilmer as Bruce Wayne/Batman and Nicole Kidman as Dr. Chase Meridian is a good blu ray DVD.  Chris O'Donnell is Richard Grayson/Robin.  In fact. Out of the four Batman movies from 1989-1997, I feel this is the best one and should be given more credit. A-lot of effort used to make this film better than the two previous Tim Burton Batman (1989) and Batman (1991) films and it paid off!  Jim Carrey makes a great villain as \\"The Riddler\\" and Tommy Lee Jones is a convincing as Two-Face. This is a great movie, you should not judge this film because of the failure of Batman & Robin (1997). This movie made the most money out the four Batman films and is still the best movie in the series in my opinion.  Just because Batman and Robin sucked does not mean this movie, Batman Forever is bad.  Batman Forever is a great film and will be remembered as the Best sequel in the Movie series.  Buy the blu ray disc version and you will be satisfied by the transfer of the film from DVD to Blu Ray. A+

Plus you can't really see what you are looking at other than the edge of a DVD.  So you could end up pulling out 10 DVDs from the difficult foam until you finally find what you are looking for.  The cardboard box is cheap and will most likely fall apart after a year or two of consistent use.  It is also not the easiest to store due to the rounded top (nothing will stay on top).  I just removed the copies we are going to use into different cases... but it feels like the pirated :(.

B0040UAYI4|4.0|I have tried several other similar products to this (Dual Frag/Fragnstein). I must say this is probably about the closest you are going to get to PC gaming on a console at this point in time. It takes some time and patience to find the sweet spot for the particular game you are trying to play but a 90% PC-like feel can be found with enough tweaking.  Overall I give this product an 8 out of 10. Definitely worth a try if you're sick of trying to use a controller to play FPS games on a console.

The enthusiasm and love for the music by the artists and their expression, including Yanni, is inspiring to watch.

Mumford & Sons is distinct, but to give a general idea of the sound, a few similar artists would be Damien Rice, The Swell Season, and The Avett Brothers.

Since this is not a review of that movie, let me ask, \\"What kind of middle-aged woman looking for meaning in life has such gorgeous teeth?\\" I couldn't buy this movie for a second.  What the heck was wrong with her first husband or James Franco or her lovely uptown loft? All middle-aged women looking for life's meaning should have it so hard.  They should also have the money and the looks to travel the world, eat pizza, and run into Javier Bardem (without a cattle gun).  Avoid at all costs unless you are a huge sap.
0393039102|4.0|A gripping story that is all the better because it is true. It covers the fall of Singapore, the building of the Burma Railroad and being a POW in a Japanese WWII camp. But it's more than that, it's a life story of a man who comes to grips with his torture and finally his torturer. It's a moving story and you won't be able to put it down.<br /><br />I also read [[ASIN:0553384503 Ship of Ghosts: The Story of the USS Houston, FDR's Legendary Lost Cruiser, and the Epic Saga of her Survivors]] which focuses more on the guys who laid the rails. Eric being an officer and skilled labor was spared that task, but it also was his downfall as a POW.<br /><br />The thing that struck me was that his take was that for every meter of track someone died. Either conscripted native labor or a POW. And that now that track is only 60 miles long and deadends with minimal usage. What a waste.<br /><br />Oh, and waterboarding, it's not just for the prisoners in Gitmo, Eric got the full treatment.
0060007737|4.0|I'm starting my own business and was curious. The book focuses on examples from large corporates but the concepts are usually transferrable. I got a used copy and the internet section is outdated. In general this can help you to refine the scope of your services and marketing. If you're reading this for school, I finished it in 4 days with a full time job, not bad.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|This is going to be a short review, at least for me, because I want to be very sure not to spoil any significant plot developments.  FROZEN is a neat, creepy little thriller with a very simple plot but very effective technique.  If you want a low-key heart-pounder and something a little offbeat...check it out.    Three friends, Parker , her boyfriend Dan and his best friend Joe are out for a day of low-budget skiing and snowboarding.  They bicker a little bit, because Parker is a newbie and Joe resents not getting to really enjoy some tricky hills because she's holding them up.  Thus, they beg the lift operator to let them go up one last time as darkness is falling.  Through circumstance and miscommunication, the lift is shut off just as the three friends reach the highest point.  And then the ski area shuts down for the week, leaving the friends stranded in the freezing cold, possibly for 5 days.    What will they do?  No cell phones.  No way to catch the ear or eye of anyone.  Just frostbite, cold, lethargy and death staring them in the face.  Naturally, grievances are aired and both the best and worst of each person is revealed.  Extreme choices will be made, and not all will go well.    That's it...you're getting no more details from me.  If this plot sounds a little like OPEN WATER on a ski-lift, I can't argue with that.  But the dynamics are handled differently...and there's more these 3 can TRY to do to help themselves.  I appreciated that although in hindsight many of their decisions could have been better, no one acted like complete idiots just so bad things could happen.  They acted with relatively believable logic, particularly considering the extreme stress.    Writer/director  Adam Green has constructed a nifty, scary little tale and handled it well.  He had, clearly, a low budget, but for the most part, it is not noticeable.  There's little need for special effects, and the when they are used, they are sparing.  Once in awhile, I wish the editor had cut away about a quarter second sooner, as a few of the cheapie seams showed.  But not enough to detract.  What Green does well is keep the prime location (a dangling ski lift) interesting and foreboding.  Although the friends are trapped in the great wide open...they are really trapped in a cramped, uncomfortable and completely exposed lift.  Green's script is serviceable as well.  The film is a brisk 90 minutes, but it is still certainly padded with some \\"character development\\" type dialogue of the \\"I remember when I was a kid\\" variety.  Without it, the film would not be feature length.  With it, it's occasionally clunky.  This is a failing of this kind of film all the time...they are damned if they don't develop characters, but they often fail to do a smooth job of it when they try.  This film doesn't completely succeed either...but it's better than most.  The desire to do a good job all round and NOT insult the intelligence of the viewer was much appreciated by me.    The three stars, who must carry the film, are okay.  None are fantastic thespians, but again, each is just slightly better than one usually gets in such a film.  Emma Bell (recently featured in THE WALKING DEAD) is Parker, and she captures the peppy spirit of the girl when things are safe, and the abject terror when things go wrong.  As Dan, Kevin Zegers (who I remember from his small role in the excellent DAWN OF THE DEAD remake) does well with the most two-dimensional character.  Best of all is Shawn Ashmore (\\"Iceman\\" in X-MEN), who has to take an initially unlikeable character and make us care about him.    FROZEN is not as flat-out terrifying and brilliant as THE DESCENT...but its straightforward approach and surprising effectiveness recalled that wonderful film.  FROZEN will not rock your world, but it will provide a chill or two.  A pleasant surprise!

0316069485|3.0|I've read all of Michael Connelly's novels and I think he's one of the best crime writers in the business.  That being said, THE REVERSAL is one of his lesser efforts.<br /><br />The major problem with THE REVERSAL is the lack of suspense.  As another reviewer noted, this novel is long on legal procedure and short on mystery.  While this novel is quite educational if you're interested in the US criminal justice system, its plot is ultimately quite predictable.  As I read this novel, I never felt like the prosecution was in any serious danger of losing its case -- which made for a less than thrilling read.<br /><br />I also felt that Connelly stumbled a bit on the characterization here.  Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller are two very interesting and complex characters, but you wouldn't know it from this novel.  In THE REVERSAL, both of them seem to be playing little more than the stereotypical cop and prosecutor.  The best Connelly novels are character-centered, but this novel is more about the plot.  That would be fine if the storyline was fresh and compelling, but that is simply not the case with THE REVERSAL.<br /><br />Still, even a subpar Connelly novel is enjoyable.  This isn't a bad novel, and I found it interesting enough to complete in a few sittings.  But if you've never read Connelly before, my advice is to skip this book and read one of his earlier novels instead -- I would recommend THE CONCRETE BLONDE, THE LAST COYOTE, BLOOD WORK, or THE LINCOLN LAWYER.

9889979942|5.0|Portrait of a People brilliantly captures the raw and diverse emotion of the people of this vast nation.  This book is an  artistic compilation of beautiful images coupled with educational and interesting captions that leave me wanting to journey to the place of my ancestors.  As a Eurasian American, this book has reignited my interest to further study my own heritage.  I have picked up the book from my coffee table on many occasions and always seem to find a new favorite portrait.  I have also given this as a gift to several people including my Chinese American mother who had a hard time believing that this piece was put together by someone who was not a native to the country.  In summary, this inspiring photographic work is a high recommend and i'm looking forward to the author's next endeavor.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I'm not sure who is the bigger idiot here--the publisher for setting such a ridiculous price for an ebook or the person who will pay this price.  There is a price point which turns people off  so much it sends them not to buy the hard cover or the paperback but straight to the library for a free copy.  This is the tipping point of ebook pricing --and it has been reached here.

B001AQO400|5.0|I was really enjoing one of my favourite movies now in HD quality.  Though I am not into extras and online materials, I am really fond of this edition.  Just have a look on Tokyo from hotel (while Scarlett is gazing through the huge window) and enjoy the swettiest sadness ever filmed!    Probably you may say that this practically two-actors and no-special-effects film doesn't need Blu-Ray quality. I can argue: it is awesome when you see your favorite movie on a widescreen TV just like you read your favourite book you've read 5 or ten times before now as a special hi-quality edition.    So if u're a kind of fan I bet you like it!    Moshi-moshi.

0618918248|3.0|richard dawkins' expressed purpose for writing \\"the god delusion\\" was to get closeted atheists and those of wavering faith to come out and wholeheartedly embrace life without god. the book is a hodgepodge of anecdotes, quotes, polemics, reflections on evolution, love letters to science, speculative passages, and an appeal on behalf of children. dawkins' plea for stopping the religious indoctrination of children is the strongest aspect of this book, in my opinion. dawkins' prescription is for children to take comparative religion classes so they understand what is out there before they are forced into one mode of thinking, with potentially dire consequences as history has shown us. however, this book certainly has its weak points as well, which we'll discuss first.<br /><br />dawkins' main argument is given in chapter 4, boldly entitled \\"why there almost certainly is no god.\\" the argument is summarized as follows. if a higher being existed which was complex enough to create the universe, then that higher being must've had an even more complex creator, i.e. the creator's creator. this leads to the question of who created the creator's creator, which leads to considering a still more complex creator of the creator's creator, i.e. the creator's creator's creator. and so forth in an infinite regress. without a suitable answer to this issue of increasing complexity, religion is critically crippled as an explanatory tool. this is in contrast to scientific theories which can lead to the very complex from the very simple, easily bypassing the infinite complexity issue altogether. darwinian evolution is of course the mighty example of such a clarifying scientific theory. religion only compounds complexity rather than simplifying, and the question of who created god brings this to light in a spectacular way. done. well then, there almost certainly is no god!...right?<br /><br />the main problem i have with this argument is dawkins' implicit assumption that god couldn't just be self-creating. as far as i know, all religions assume the answer to the question of who created god (or whatever name one chooses to give to that higher force) by positing that god needs no creator. dawkins posits that god needs a disparate creator in order for this argument to work. that's certainly fine in and of itself, but i don't see that metaphysical assertion as being any more logically sound than the assumptions made by organized religions. who's right? who knows when we're ascribing various properties to god. if you are talking about something physical like turning water into wine, then science will have something to say. however, if you are talking about something extremely metaphysical like the creation of god, then no physical experiment can ever grant you a solid answer. that's simply out of the reach of science.<br /><br />dawkins also makes the error of blaming religion for the horrible actions of man done in god's name. dawkins doesn't just lists heinous events in history, but actually furthermore claims that the mere existence of religious worship itself, no matter how moderate, is harmful because society's acceptance of faith as an excuse for lack of critical thinking opens the way to extremist views and acts. it is of course logically possible for god to exist and be worthy of devotion, for the core of a religion to be correct, and for most believers to simply be \\"doing it wrong\\" all the same. incidentally, most believers probably believe other believers are doing it wrong in some aspect or other. just look at all the flavors of christianity available, to say nothing of the disagreements with other religions! that faith is irrational is without question, but i think dawkins might not fully grasp some nuances of faith. for example, he mostly brushes aside personal experiences that crystallize the faith in an individual as psychological foibles. while i agree that the word \\"faith\\" is widely misused by many who probably don't really have it, the true attainment of faith arguably should appear incomprehensible to the outside observer. see for example kierkegaard's excellent philosophical work \\"fear and trembling\\" for some enlightening analysis on the nature of faith, in my opinion.<br /><br />on the other hand, \\"the god delusion\\" does have some strong positives in its favor. principal among these is dawkins' repeated impassioned appeal that children no longer be considered christian children or muslim children, but rather the children of christian or muslim parents, respectively. there are many reasons given to not inculcate any particular religion into the minds of the young before they've reached the age of reason. forced belief perverts the meaning of faith and can  distort ethics. for example, dawkins cites a study done of young israeli schoolchildren in which the children were given a summary of the battle of jericho and asked whether they totally approved, partially approved, or totally disapproved of the actions of joshua and the israelites. in the battle of jericho, joshua and the israelites were told by god to kill every man, woman, child and animal in the conquered city, take all the precious metals, and then burn down the city. in other words, god is sanctioning genocide and pillage. 66% of the israeli children gave total approval and 26% totally disapproved, with 8% giving partial approval. a control group of israeli children was given the same summary and asked the same question of approval but with the names changed from \\"joshua\\" and \\"the israelites\\" to \\"general lin\\" and \\"a chinese kingdom 3,000 years ago.\\" this time, only 7% of these children totally approved of god-sanctioned genocide while 75% totally disapproved. most of the young children can actually recognize the terrible nature of genocide except when their religion teaches them otherwise. dawkins rightly suggests letting children take comparative religion classes and letting them choose their faith or lack thereof at a later age after seeing all sides.<br /><br />dawkins is a trained scientist and his exposition shines in chapters 5 and 6, when he is focusing more on science. in particular, i found the presentation of memetic theory as a paradigm for the development of religions quite fascinating. the discussion on the evolution of childhood gullibility with religious belief being a psychological by-product is also quite intriguing and plausible.<br /><br />in the end, did dawkins achieve the goal of getting the reader to embrace atheism? i don't know. i can't speak for others, but in my case, no. there were too many weak arguments including dawkins' main argument, in my opinion. however, that's not to say that \\"the god delusion\\" wasn't worth reading. hopefully this book will perform the public service of dissuading readers from force-feeding religion to their young impressionable children. this book also collects a lot of interesting anecdotes and quotes. i was quite amused by the following joke proof of god's existence, which i will leave you with:<br /><br />\\"the argument from incomplete devastation: a plane crashed killing 143 passengers and crew. but one child survived with only third-degree burns. therefore god exists.\\"guably should appear incomprehensible to the outside observer. see for example kierkegaard's excellent philosophical work \\"fear and trembling\\" for some enlightening analysis on the nature of faith, in my opinion.    on the other hand, \\"the god delusion\\" does have some strong positives in its favor. principal among these is dawkins' repeated impassioned appeal that children no longer be considered christian children or muslim children, but rather the children of christian or muslim parents, respectively. there are many reasons given to not inculcate any particular religion into the minds of the young before they've reached the age of reason. forced belief perverts the meaning of faith and can  distort ethics. for example, dawkins cites a study done of young israeli schoolchildren in which the children were given a summary of the battle of jericho and asked whether they totally approved, partially approved, or totally disapproved of the actions of joshua and the israelites. in the battle of jericho, joshua and the israelites were told by god to kill every man, woman, child and animal in the conquered city, take all the precious metals, and then burn down the city. in other words, god is sanctioning genocide and pillage. 66% of the israeli children gave total approval and 26% totally disapproved, with 8% giving partial approval. a control group of israeli children was given the same summary and asked the same question of approval but with the names changed from \\"joshua\\" and \\"the israelites\\" to \\"general lin\\" and \\"a chinese kingdom 3,000 years ago.\\" this time, only 7% of these children totally approved of god-sanctioned genocide while 75% totally disapproved. most of the young children can actually recognize the terrible nature of genocide except when their religion teaches them otherwise. dawkins rightly suggests letting children take comparative religion classes and letting them choose their faith or lack thereof at a later age after seeing all sides.    dawkins is a trained scientist and his exposition shines in chapters 5 and 6, when he is focusing more on science. in particular, i found the presentation of memetic theory as a paradigm for the development of religions quite fascinating. the discussion on the evolution of childhood gullibility with religious belief being a psychological by-product is also quite intriguing and plausible.    in the end, did dawkins achieve the goal of getting the reader to embrace atheism?

B0043GAZYS|5.0|This movie is the most perfect representation of modern geek culture yet to be created.  It is a brilliant mess of visual, aural, verbal and technological wonderment.  That it comes from a graphic novel, should come as no surprise.  That it managed to surpass that graphic novel in many ways, it completely insane (and I loved the comic book too).  The casting is over the top, and perfect.  Michael Cera has his best role here, playing almost against type -- but not quite.  It is a movie to pick up and watch again and again, to see ever more unusual and astonishing details.  Tack on some geek culture buffs as you watch, and this is the total experience.    The combo DVD/Blu-Ray pack is expensive, but the quality is good.  I would have preferred a single blu-ray release, since I am of the geek culture, and have had a blu-ray player for years.  I am tired of these combo packs, and the extra charges they imply.  But, this movie is definitely worth it.  If you didn't see it in the theater, definitely give it a try now.  You will most likely find something to enjoy here.

0553805371|4.0|In a philosophy class I took back in college, the instructor started out with Plato.  The next book on the list was about string theory; I think it was Brian Greene's popularization of the theory.  I think my professor was trying to show the parallels of the two sorts of examinations into the unknown world.  I think many of my classmates were put off because the first half of the text was spent describing the theoretical and experimental advances that led to string theory being postulated.  These concepts are esoteric and confusing if you have never encountered them before.  Even though that author did a good job of the project he was working on, it all seems complex and unnecessary.<br /><br />Perhaps both the twin realms of inquiry of philosophy and theoretical physics are unnecessary.  I'm sure I can find a person who has lived happily in a platonic world commanded by Newtonian laws.  I can't and that's why I am glad there are intelligent people working on and developing both fields today.  The authors of this text take for granted that science has superseded philosophy as a realm of inquiry.  They may have a point in the popular imagination - how many working philosophers can the average person name?  In that context, how many working scientists can the average person name?  I bet one of the latter is one of the coauthors of this text.<br /><br />For what the text is at its center is a new form of philosophy, but one that has built around it a theoretical, and testable superstructure.  There is no mistake in remembering the old name for science is `Natural Philosophy'.  This philosophy has grown in fits and starts as the technology and the mathematical realm breed a synthesis that can be tested in the real world.  This synthesis is what is presented in the book - we can describe the rules guiding our and any universe that is possible.  We see how the rules of the universe we live in are just right to develop us, but we see that our development was not unique or the result of divine intelligence.  The grand design works without a designer, no unmoved mover.  The text is concise, but the descriptions of the phenomena are exceeding clear for me.  There may be a learning curve for novices though, as I have some scientific background.<br /><br />Perhaps -- in the end Pangloss was right: All is for the best in this, the best of all possible worlds.  Only it is guided by m-theory.the result of divine intelligence.  The grand design works without a designer, no unmoved mover.

B000SINT52|5.0|I don't buy the one star reviews , those are from limbaughites mainly who are brainwashed. I didn't agree with alot of what was in this movie but it still made me think about the issues of poor security , and other facts like the fact that Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11. We still did a good thing in removing sadam ,but we paid for it in our money and blood. Anyways this one is for people with a open mind who can further investigate what happened and not for right wing nuts who get their facts from talk radio. So sit back and remember that this is slanted and then afterwards investigate to see what you come up with.

Did I miss something?? That stuff is super toxic to dogs! As little as 6 grapes can cause fatal kidney failure.    I am absolutely flabbergasted. How can you write a book about dogs and not know what can potentially harm them?
1439133948|3.0|I just bought and read the Bujold's newest, Cryoburn, and must confess to a longing for manic Miles Naismith or endearing Miles Vorkosigan. The plot has been discussed already. Suffice it to say that Roic is not a memorable character and there's nobody else we've ever seen before but Miles. Characters are made mostly of cardboard, freeze-dried. The concept of a planet where everyone tries to beat death by freezing themselves was gruesome, to say the least, and should have led to a deeper examination of what perpetual life is really worth in the long run: i.e. who wants to live forever and be OLD at the same time? Why would new generations want to revive old people who are hundred year old relics of a culture that no longer exists? Doesn't eternity get boring? Isn't death really a new beginning for the soul, rather than an end? And especially, how a planet ruled by the dead (in the form of proxy votes) lacks vitality and creativity because change is stifled. Imagine this kind of philosophy leaching into Barrayarian culture...Bujold, who is capable of this kind of depth, misses the mark.    The book was still engaging and a fun read, just not up to her earlier works. Two things I am grateful for, the humor is still there (although it feels like it's been tacked like a loose book page) and she finally provides the pronunciation for the name Vorkosigan!    SPOILER ALERT!!!  -----------------      As to the book's ending, can anyone say Reichenbach Falls?
0316113506|5.0|I love this book.  It's the how & why exercise helps change your brain. It talks about neurotransmitters, synapses, and all sort of chemicals, brain receptors, hormones,  etc and how they connect in the brain in laymans terms.  Of course exercise will help many people suffering from depression & anxiety to feel better....this book explains how that happens.  It's easy for a doctor to say \\"exercise it will help\\" but I need to know HOW it helps, WHY it helps, WHAT is it helping.
B001TK80C0|1.0|I wish I could provide a review of the movie, but the DVD was messed up and it couldn't be viewed.  It would play a little then freeze up, play a little then freeze up.  Over and over again.  I bought the DVD as a gift for my nephew for Christmas.  I bought it in November.  It's too late to return the item because considering the time it took for him to open it (on Christmas), to watch it, to find out it was messed up, and to tell me about it, the return time alloted had passed.  I couldn't return it anyway because it was open.  I guess Amazon doesn't guarantee that their movies actually work.  That stinks because he was really looking foward to watching it.  It's all he asked me to buy him.  I just ordered another one from somewhere else to replace it.
0812973992|5.0|That high-wire act in August, 1974. One man, with a little help from his friends, an unusual man who didn't allow notions of impossibility to sully his dreams into nullity, that man walked, hopped skittered danced and jumped from one World Trade Center tower to the other.<br /><br />They were new then, those towers. And no one could possible conceive what would happen 27 years later. But thinking back, looking at a high-wire act for the ages that also happens to frame the stories told in Colum McCann's \\"Let the Great World Spin\\", and you can't help but think what a perfect recipe for metaphor, for a new way to understand --and muddle through -- this world we live in.<br /><br />That high-wire act is above all things, every single life lived.<br /><br />It's not a new idea for a novel. In some way every novel, even the terrible ones, maybe even especially the terrible ones, try to and somehow always achieve if only slightly, a new description of the world -- a prescription of the author's beliefs about our world -- and sometimes a proscription against it.<br /><br />Personally, and what review isn't personal, I can be moved, displaced from my own perception of the world and into someone else's, but only when the novel is truly good, well-written, lyrical, effortless. And this one is.<br /><br />Just let it swallow you up, let go. And as the stories move from one carefully drawn protagonist to another, as this great world of characters slowly grows into a portrait of our America in the 1970s, our world before 9/11, let the nuances within them, the special moments McCann crafts into his novel surprise you, move you to twinges of sadness and joy, and carry you away into the beauty, the grace in every single moment we have together.

0740748475|4.0|Let me first say that this is COMPLETE. Is contains every C&H strip ever published in book form. The collective volumes are EXTREMELY heavy, so don't plan on bringing this around wherever you go.    There is one C&H strip that this collection doesn't include, however it was not published in any other book. In fact, the only time it's ever been published is when it was first released in newsprint, and even then it was only released in half of the newspapers permitted to publish C&H strips (the other half published a different strip). No explanation has ever been given as to why this was the case.    Keep in mind that two strips WERE edited for the collection, the first on Jan. 7th, 1987, and the second on Nov. 25th, 1988. These strips are not difficult to spot; I only knew that two of them had been altered, though I didn't know which and I picked them out the first time I read through them. Even so, this only detracts minimally for me, it's still excellent.    The binding itself is a bit cheap; I can see how it would be a problem for people who mistreat and/or stretch the bindings. I don't see it being a problem for me.    Overall, this is an excellent collection with only a few minor drawbacks.
081297381X|3.0|With the financial collapse of 2007-2009, the hidden weaknesses of the financial system worldwide became evident to everyone.  The \\"Black Swans\\" of the title are these major, disruptive and unforeseen (and, according to Mr. Taleb, unforeseeable) events that mark a drastic change in a system. Taleb identifies the source of these events in the intrinsic complexity of our world and our unavoidable inability to understand, much less forecast, it's evolution.  Since we just can't plan, let's stop trying, says Taleb, and instead embrace the inevitable uncertainty of our world by trying to mitigate it's (unknown) consequences and take advantage of the opportunities that it can generate. Remaining in the realm of finance and investments, Mr. Taleb suggests and investment strategy that uses a mix of both very safe (treasury bonds) and very risky (very out-of-the-money options) with the goal of preserving the capital while keeping the door open for potentially large gains in case a Black Swan happens to pass by (of course, these strategy is not as simple as it is presented, considering that even T-Bonds carry a certain degree of risk - for example inflation and interest rate risk - and options are not free).  The main target of Mr. Taleb criticism is the \\"normal distribution\\" (the well known \\"bell curve\\" or \\"gaussian distribution\\") that lies at the hearth of most financial models currently used. If the assumption of a normal distribution of expected returns is faulty, as Mr. Taleb affirms, then practically all financial models that we use today should be rejected as unreliable. The main flaw of these models is that they only work in a \\"normal\\" environment (where changes in the returns are reasonably small) with continuos, differentiable functions, and they are totally inapplicable in case of sudden shocks in the system. In fact, such shocks are simply ignored from the analysis:  not having any tool to deal with this Black Swan, financial analysts simply ignore them as \\"totally unlikely\\" (\\"they sweep them under the rug\\", as the great mathematician and Taleb's hero, Benoit Mandelbrot, said), and keep going with their calculation. We've just seen as on of these \\"totally unlikely\\" events almost blew off the entire world's financial system. It's hard to argue with Mr. Taleb on this point.  Some of these ideas may sound somewhat familiar, and they should: in fact, none of the concepts expressed by Mr. Taleb in the book are new or original. Mr. Taleb repackaged existing ideas and theories in an easy to read (although somewhat unsatisfactory) format and applied to it his undeniable self promoting skills.    When Mr. Taleb moves from finance to general philosophy is even less convincing. In his enthusiasm to to apply his principles to the entire human history, Mr. Taleb end up confusing two very different sources of uncertainty: lack of knowledge by the observer and lack of causality in the event itself. The fact that we are unable to understand (even less, to forecast) an event until after the fact does not mean that the event happened simply because of chance. Our lack of understanding in most cases (actually, in all significant event in the history of mankind) simply reflects lack of information, insufficient analysis tools, stupidity, etc.  FTo cite just an example, affirming, like Taleb does, that the rise and fall of Rome was due to pure luck shows lack of either proficiency in history or intellectual honesty (or both).    The book has severe flaws. The structure of the book is confusing. The style is sloppy, unpolished, with extensive - and unecessary - use of non-existing words (uberphilosopher? shmonfirmation?). To finally get to a concept the reader is forced to go through pages and pages of redundant personal anecdotes or irrelevant stories (that are probably supposed to explain and perhaps entertain, but in fact they are not explicative nor amusing), and the list could continue. In fact, all the worthy concepts of the books could becondensed in no more than a couple of chapters.  What is probably most annoying is the overblown ego of Mr. Taleb that seems to consider himself one of the few (the others being mostly dead) holders of the \\"truth\\", and eager  to deride anybody who ever dared to say or write something he doesn't agree with (from basically every Nobel prize winner to Galileo Galilei).    Far from being the breakthrough masterpiece that it has been defined, \\"Black Swan\\" is a provocative and interesting, although somewhat disappointing, book that it's worth a look, if nothing else as an encouragement to explore more this subject and to challenge the common accepted wisdom (or lack thereof) of the mainstream world of economics and finance.
B001I1M3CS|5.0|I bought this book for my wife.  After reading it, she insisted I read it also.  It is a fascinating tale of a small town and the interactions of the characters.  I highly recommend it.
B00004TWZF|5.0|It is an amazing film . It hasn't dated at all. I saw it in France when it first came out. I bought the video in English . Unfortunately, my recent purcjhase on DVD from America DID NOT ALLOW ME TO WATCH IT in England. Why are such products offered via Amazon for enquirers from the U.K ?
B002ZG981E|5.0|The movie was unbelievable.  I saw it in theaters but really wanted to see it again because I couldn't really figure all of it out. The blu-ray quality is amazing, just like seeing it in the theater. I highly recommend.

0007256531|4.0|Very accessible description of various experiments in micro-economics. The outcome is invariably that decisions are heavily influenced  by factors that are either un-acknowledged (influence of non-monetary set-up in cheating) or not accurately accounted for (e.g. physical arousal). This is not a comment on the book itself, but these ideas have by now been so widely disseminated in popular science publications that I don't feel I have learned very much from the book that I hadn't already read about elsewhere. Maybe one thing: that much of the thinking that led to this book was triggered by a very traumatic experience, 70% third degree burns from a magnesium flare left Ariely hospitalized for many months at age 18.

B001SO69IY|2.0|There's maybe two or three tracks that I genuinely like. There's also maybe two or three tracks that are \\"tolerable\\". The rest...pretty bad. I'm a huge Wu-Tang fan, and while I never expect them to return to their glory days (Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, Ironman, Liquid Swords, Tical, etc.), I do still expect something quality. Compared to the very solid first album, this is pretty much garbage. It starts with the production, which seems about as forced (aka commercialized) as the production on Tical 0: The Prequel. It just doesn't fit with the style of Redman and Method Man. There's even hints of the dreaded auto-tune being used! Red and Meth are best with dark, grimy, or just straight up laid back beats...not the forced \\"club banger\\" beats we have here. Lyrically, they're still mostly on point as ever, it's just the concept of the songs and the production that kills this.

0743437497|3.0|So, I totally expected to love The Shining. It seems to have kick-ass ratings and reviews, it's a haunted house story (and I tend to enjoy those the most when it comes to the horror genre), and it's King (and I've previously enjoyed three out of the five books I've read of his). Expectations were sky-high for me. That led me to be disappointed in it. Don't get me wrong, I liked it, most of the time. I just didn't love it.<br /><br />My main issue with The Shining was that it dragged. Every time I put the book down, I literally had to force myself to pick it back up. I think had it not been for the fact that I've read and enjoyed other Stephen King books, I would've put it down. I was just supremely bored throughout the first 200 pages. Very little of interest happened during that time. I kept thinking \\"For the love of God when is this book going to be OVER?!\\" It did end up getting a bit better after those initial 200 pages.<br /><br />My next semi-issue was that I hated Wendy. That woman was a TERRIBLE mother. She was constantly excusing her husband's behavior. MILD SPOILER HERE: Her husband (who's a raging alcoholic) breaks their son's arm and she still stays with him. Covers up for him. And then when the husband slaps the son, she's all sobbing hysterically \\"You promised you wouldn't hit him again!\\" All I kept thinking was \\"You massive idiot! He hit him once! DUH, he was going to do it again!\\" Gah! END OF MILD SPOILER. I didn't blame Jack for getting annoyed with Wendy. Hell, by the end of the book, I wanted to throttle her. I'm not saying anything Jack did was justified, but seriously that woman grated (and I have to say, I did laugh hysterically when Jack told Wendy and Danny that they could count him out of their duet/duel hysterics mostly because both Wendy and Danny were neurotic little freaks who were massively annoying).<br /><br />Now that I've got the ranting out of the way, I did like The Shining. Mostly because when it was good, it was great. The creepy parts were seriously creepy (the elevator scared the crap out of me) and when the book got going, it was pretty hard to put down (but again I say it took me 200 freakin' pages). And this is King. He is a superb writer no matter how much the story drags or how much you hate the protagonists/heroes. That's someone who's extremely talented.<br /><br />Do I recommend The Shining? I think I do. However, I will say that if this is going to be your first foray into King, I think you should probably pick up something else (although my first King was The Stand and I've heard some die-hard King fans say that's not the best place to start). This wasn't really my favorite book by him but from what I've read, I think this is better than Carrie and The Gunslinger. Just not as good as The Stand, Misery, and The Girl Who Loves Tom Gordon.creepy (the elevator scared the crap out of me) and when the book got going, it was pretty hard to put down (but again I say it took me 200 freakin' pages).

0312330871|4.0|Let me just start by saying that \\"And Then There Were None\\" could possibly be the best mystery book I have ever read! It starts out with ten entirely different people and explaining them each separately, which is a very boring way to start out a book, and explaining their professions and lives. When they all get invited to \\"Indian Island\\" is where the book starts to get very interesting. In all of there rooms is a hanging of the \\"Ten Little Indians\\" poem and they all think that is cute and dandy since its named Indian Island, until they find out the real meaning of the odd poem. But to find out the meaning you're just going to have to read the book itself!<br />  The way Agatha Christie sets up the mystery and action of the book is intense and intelligent. As soon as you guess who is the murderer, that person gets killed and that just makes you want to read it more. It is a read that kept me up late at nights reading it and also during the day. This book shows fear in peoples consciences, the guilt that lies within, and the hate among strangers. It is amazing what Agatha Christie can put into her novels and still have it all fit together. Its like making a puzzle, there is lots of little pieces that you have to put together but in the end it makes a perfect picture that is clear. It is like this with her book, tons of little things going on and you cant quite make sense of what it is until the book is complete and you can see the whole picture instead of just tiny little pieces. Which also makes this book a fairly hard read. I did find trouble with some things but it all worked out.<br /> I think you can apply this to life with meeting new people and having to learn to trust them and not be afraid of what they could possibly do. You can also apply this to when times are rough and you face hardships and challenges, you have to learn to trust the people you are with no matter how much you dislike them and don't agree with them, and you have to stick together.<br /> In my final statement I would just overall say that this is a very good read, and also I would like to vote Agatha Christie as my favorite author of mystery and murder books. I would be much obliged for anyone that has time to read and likes this genre to read this book, for it is an epic read. Also if you're a reader read some other novels and mysteries by Agatha Christie because they are extremely good also, they are mostly mystery and suspense. I would also like to say don't ever go to an island if someone gives you a letter and you have no idea where it is from for tat is just pure stupidity. (well if you are stupid enough to go how about telling someone, its always a smart idea) :)l statement I would just overall say that this is a very good read, and also I would like to vote Agatha Christie as my favorite author of mystery and murder books.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|I've got to start off this review with \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" since it is primarily because of this track that Naked even exists. I had never liked Spector's version; the song sounded incredibly cheesy, like something one would play at the end of a bad romance film. I remember thinking, \\"What a shame to have these lovely lyrics drenched in such awful music.\\" The Naked version, however, is quite pretty and demonstrates how beautiful the song could have become had The Beatles properly recorded it.    As for the rest of the album: The songs have benefited immensely now that they are not trapped in the \\"wall of sound,\\" most notably \\"Across the Universe.\\" I personally feel that while that sort of sound worked for other artists, The Beatles were not one of them. The removal of orchestral overdubs from \\"I Me Mine\\" has allowed the song to become a favorite song of mine. George's vocals on \\"For You Blue\\" are also much more prominent on Naked, which is great since he delivers a super sweet vocal performance. Adding \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" was a terrific idea, it fits perfectly.    \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" is the only song in which the original version sounds superior to the Naked one. Although the Naked one doesn't make me cringe,  it doesn't really compare to the first, which contains Paul's better vocals.   All in all, while John and George may have been content with Spector's work, I'm glad that Paul was not. After three decades of complaining, he finally remade Let It Be, the way it should have been all along.
B001UW58WW|5.0|I love this CD. I would give it 10 stars, if possible!     All music I like moves me in some way, but it has been years since any came along that did so in a way that I could just fall into it. Generally instrumentals don't do it. Mostly because its the combinations of the vocals, and music-the over all feel of a song that moves me. I don't listen to lyrics-most of the time the vocals, and music put off a different feel than the lyrics. Example: Pearl Jam, where the lyrics are emotionally dark, but Eddy Veder has the sexiest voice, and the instrumentals great (\\"Black\\" is a good example). I like the quote: \\"Music expresses that which cannot be put into words and cannot remain silent\\" which makes my mp3 player the equivelant of a diary, except noone else can understand it;)     I expected this to be more of a relaxing cd, something I could listen to while writing without getting distracted. What a pleasant surprise!The whole cd is wonderful (although \\"Smooth Criminal\\" didn't do much for me). For myself the best songs were: \\"Aint no sunshine\\"-its slow, and jazzy, and when he plays the beautiful high note, that just lingers, I'm a goner (anyone know who the horn player is)? \\"Gypsy Dance\\" starts out slow, and I almost dismissed this song, but when it took off, I actually laughed! Not because the song is funny, but because its so happy! Garrett is one of the fastest violinists, playing 13 notes per second, and this ability is really experienced here. \\"Chelsea Girl\\" was written by Garrett for his on/off again girlfriend, and it has a certain sweet sadness to it. I swear at the end, the violin says \\"I love you.\\" *sniff.* \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" - Even if you don't like Metallica, or ever heard them, this is a gorgeous song! Garrett puts the same passion into Metallica as he does Bach and it shows. Lastly, \\"Who Wants To Live Forever\\" which is simply amazing!    I also ordered \\"Rock Symphonies.\\" If you've ever wondered what a 290 year old stratovarous, and electric guitar would sound like together, you'll enjoy it as well. I know many people aren't fond of crossovers, but he does draw the younger kids in-first with his edgy sound, and look, then the classics. Who knows maybe one day we'll see kids running around playing air violin, instead of air guitar, ok and maybe one 45 yr old kid-but only once, to \\"The 5th\\" ha! Recommend highly.      Music is the mediator between the spiritual and the sensual life. ~Ludwig van Beethoven
B0034G4OVS|3.0|First, great foundation for a story. Chairlift strands three friends 60 feet above the ground at night on a ski lift. Everyone's gone home and no one knows they're up there. Fantastic! I love these \\"what do you do in this situation\\" types of stories. This premise is unsettling enough. The writers should not have added the wolves into the story. Should. Not. Have. Done. That.      In this day and age of sophisticated audiences, there is not one human being on the Earth who still acribes to the \\"big bad wolf\\" mentality. There is enough scientific data to disprove wolves attacking people in the wilderness. The story completely jumped the shark at that point and left me very disappointed. The writers needed to have more faith in their initial story because they really didn't need another \\"villian\\" to spice things up.     If they HAD to add an villian, a bear is a much more plausible choice because bears WILL attack and kill people.    Anyway, good story - could have been so much better minus the \\"wolves as baddies\\" ploy. I know too much about wolves in real life. I didn't buy it for a second and it detracted from the film.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Quality camera work, the production is excellent.  Lotta soap in my opinion but to be expected in today's style.  The extra features are pretty good and necessary to understand the events.  The Australian locations and battle scenes are very impressive, detailed, nerve wracking.

The album is great!  Buy it!  Get the one with the DVD, it's worth it!  Even people who think Kanye is a douche and terrible person will have the hardest time not enjoying this music  I hate myself for listening to it SO much.  Kanye is a musical genius.  This is what hip hop is meant to be.
B004AKCME8|5.0|This has to be one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The graphics of this movie were amazing, and for the most part I was impressed with them.<br /><br />The plot was really cliche, but it had its moments. There was quite a few disturbing and dark scenes in the movie, but for the most part it flowed really smoothly. I'm still not sure on how owls can fight to the death with swords, but it looked really cool.<br /><br />For the most part, I liked most of the characters even if I didn't catch their names the first 3 times I saw the movie. I really liked Soren, and I thought he was very relatable.<br /><br />This movie makes me want to go read the book that it was based off of.
B000OT8GCQ|3.0|Johns view on his life was in great description. I felt like I knew him and felt like I was there in the story. However, I feel like the emotion was missing. There was hardly a moment that I felt on edge except for maybe when his father passes away while he's away. That was sad, but overall a great read for someone who likes romance novels with out the dirty details :)
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Casandra Clare's novel has many twist and turns that are blind in the eye. You are so caught up in the ook that you habe no idea what have might have hit you.    In this novel it's about a girl getting heself into mischeif and ends up in the Shadowhunters world. The world is so different from what I have ever read. It's way more cooler than Harry Potter. And the ultimate fight is like nothing you have even thought of.

B001E45XT4|2.0|SOUND QUALITY    Honestly, not the best headphones I've had. Not even close really. As a few reviewers have already stated, the bass response is awful. These are the type of headphones where if you've owned a really good pair of headphones before and then put these on, you'll know the sound is off and it'll make you go crazy. Not a good pair of headphones at all if you're OCD about sound quality.    COMFORT    They're a little tight on the head vs. other headphones I've owned, but i don't find them uncomfortable at all. I actually like how tight they are. They're lightweight and you barely notice that you have them on after a short while. The mic is a little short for my tastes, but i don't mind it as much. I really like the feel of these. The fuzzy velour around the ear pieces are really soft and comfortable when wearing. 4 stars here for sure.    OVERALL    Most gamers want/need good sound quality when looking for headphones, and honestly these aren't that good. I played a round of Bad Company 2 with these, and the sound quality was awful vs. a pair of Razer's that i owned previously (which suddenly went bad after a year).     If you're more forgiving when it comes to sound quality, then these are good budget gaming headphones for you. Otherwise, I'd look elsewhere.

B003YOZNBU|2.0|With the cast including Josh Brolin, John Malkovich, Megan Fox and Michael Fassbender, \\"Johan Hex\\" should be a decent action movie. And sure, the film opens with a nice gun fight sequence, but something goes wrong after a while and, despite its short running time (81 minutes including credits), the film soon becomes a long, tedious ride, with a story that doesn't know where it really wants to go.    Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin) is a post-Civil War bounty hunter with special abilities like (only briefly) resurrecting the dead. The DC Comics anti-hero, whose family was killed by Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), agrees to work for President Grant (Aidan Quinn) only because the very terrorist plotting against the government is Turnbull himself.    The script is by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, known for their works \\"Crank\\" and its sequel (as a writer/director team) starring Jason Statham. Perhaps their fast-paced, anything-goes style could bring something new to the weak story. I am afraid Jimmy Hayward (who served as a co-director in \\"Horton Hears a Who!\\") is not the best choice for this material.     Players are doing their best. Josh Brolin as the vengeful titular hero (with impressive special make-ups) and Michael Fassbender (\\"Inglourious Basterds\\") as Burke, Turnbull's sadistic henchman both did outstanding jobs. Even their skillful acting cannot help the entire project, though.
0307269752|2.0|\\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" left me scratching my head as to way it is so immensely popular. At 55 pages I was still lost in the introduction of the main characters and I already found the story line extremely slow and uneventful. I made myself read to page 100 before I gave up on it. By that time the story had only picked slightly and I was grateful for the excuse to start something more interesting. There is surely a fascinating plot, but it gets lost in the details of the words. At times I found myself reading a page or two and completely forgetting which character was being described. I am not sure if this is a direct result of the author's style or the fact that it was translated from Swedish.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist makes a hero liken to Robert Langdon (\\"The DaVinci Code\\", Dan Brown), a middle-age or older gentleman, a bit of a womanizer or at least has unconventional romance, and is expected to have great knowledge in his respected field. He was found guilty of libel, as a reporter, but we are alluded to the fact that he may have been set up. Thus one was supposed to bond with his character out of sympathy or indignation. It really didn't work for me. I got tired of hearing his back-story.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander is the girl with the dragon tattoo. Moody, dark, proficient, and hard-core, she strikes me as a girl not to mess with. She intrigues me. I didn't discover enough about her character to say more than this. If I try this book again, it will be because I want to learn more about her.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />If you are the type that enjoys the poetry of words as much as the plot line, \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" is for you. Somewhere I am sure there is a good story, I just got bored to tears before I found it. One day I may give it another try, but for now there are plenty of other books that will get my attention first.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I couldn't stop myself running through the first two novels...they were great. If only it had stopped there. This novel did not hold my interest...was depressing and unsatisfying in the end. What happened? Taking Katniss out of the ARena for one thing. That was the cool thing about the others...I thought throwing her in twice might have pushed it, but it worked well. This third installment left that formula...I realize the story had to go somewhere else, but this was a totally depressing direction.
0553582038|1.0|This book is pretty okay, but it kind of feels like he is only telling half the story.  The \\"Wild Cards\\" novels created by the same author are really his greatest work, so when he is done with that hopefully he will come back to this series and finish it up.

0312360258|2.0|I read this book expecting it to be on par with Twilight and the Vampire Academy series and was disappointed.  The House of Night is an interesting setting but the characters fell flat for me.  Zoey is your typical high school teen, focused on boys and fighting with her parents.  Once she is told she must become a vampire she meets an array of cute guys and the stereotypical bad girl who's out to get her.  Though this is YA, I would not recommend it to anyone younger than 16, as it has some sexual references - one to oral sex.  This is not something I think is appropriate for teen girls to read about.  Overall the plot was ok, I liked the magic rituals and how Zoey's Native American heritage tied in but I will not be reading more of the series.  Even if you love vampires, I would skip this one and move on to something with a stronger protagonist.

As always, Ken Follett delivers. His research is impecable as is his character development and prose.

B002L3RVCY|5.0|I got this for my 8 yr. old son for Xmas.  He loves star wars and it was a hit in the car on the way up to Grandma's House.
B001QMCJ1Y|5.0|I was so glad to be able to find this movie on Blu ray and DVD at amazon.com.  I ordered both, one for me and one for my sister.  The movies came in short time and have, once again, been enjoyed by all.  This is such a wonderful movie and I thrilled to add it to my collection on Blu ray.  Thank you so much.  Donna
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I watched this for the first time on cable over the weekend.  It was so funny!!  Loved the ironic message at the end about the little girl pageants.  The only thing I should have done was rent it instead of watching it on Comedy Central, which interrupted the film every 10 minutes with 5 minutes of commercial.
B00008EYA5|1.0|This is the third time that I have tried to purchase this Video but each time the same thing happens.  We start the video and it just gets to the disclaimer before the picture starts and then keeps repeating the disclaimer  and goes no further.  I have tried to get it to go past this spot but have no luck. I have had no trouble returning this and am glad that I am dealing with you when something like this happens.  I would love to get this video but with this problem I am about to give up.  All three of the videos that we got were new in there original covering.  Thank you
0470601787|4.0|The book has a ton of useful information that can be easily implemented.  I am looking forward to meeting attendees getting more info and actually enjoying the meeting!  If I have one complaint, it's the font used in the book.  I found it somewhat difficult to read, which is ironic given the topic of the book.
B002T9H2MO|4.0|Let me first say that I'm not a huge fan of sci-fi.  I enjoyed Star Wars (when I was a kid), I enjoyed X-Files a bit, but for the most part it's just not my thing.  That said, this is an amazing film.  It's a slow paced thriller that is intelligently written and filmed.  It truly doesn't even really come across as a sci-fi, yet fans of the genre will greatly appreciate it.  It's beautiful to look at and has somewhat of a timeless quality about it.  I almost saw this in the theater and now I wish I had.  Truly amazing!  The DVD package could have been better, but it does include a short film titled \\"Whistle\\" which also \\"blew\\" me away... a very good extra on the DVD.  Whistle alone is worth the price of the disc.  And Moon?  One of the best movies I've seen across all genres and my favorite sci-fi yet.  Do NOT miss this one!!!!!

B004HYDL1K|5.0|If you are a fan of Robet Rodriguez or Quinten Terantino, then this movie is for you! It's raw, hilarious and worth watching over and over again! an instant classic in my book! NOT FOR THE KIDDIES
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|I just saw this movie in the theatre. It's a wonderful, escapist, fun filled ride through romance and adventure. It's what going to the cinema is supposed to be about.     Most of the criticisms of the movie seem to be from people who don't understand or appreciate the genre. There's not a lot of sex scenes, gore or 3D special effects. Instead, the film makers have tried to keep our attention by using plot, humour, lavish cinematography, the beautiful Venice as a backdrop, and the stylish, star qualities of the leads in Jolie and Depp.    The movie is a throw back to the romantic adventures of the 50s. I believe it is a remake of an older film. I enjoyed it in a similar fashion to The Thomas Crown Affair, which is also a remake of an older film.    Some critics have complained that Jolie appeared a bit stiff in this role. I disagree. She was larger than life in elegance and sexiness, and that's the whole point in making the movie. Some people just don't get it. I can guarantee that most men won't be taking their eyes off her even when other characters enter the scene.    Jolie plays a British goverment agent who's in love with the major league criminal that everyone else is looking for.     [As an aside] Jolie's character's name is Elise Clifton-Ward. This is an inescapable reference to the character, Penelope Creighton-Ward, who was also a British secret agent in The Thunderbirds TV series from the 1960s.      Americans won't know much about The Thunderbirds, but Brits, Australians and probably some others know Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward from this hugely successful kids TV adventure series that we all grew up loving. Penelope (and all the other charcters) were played by wooden marionettes.    This may explain why Jolie sometimes appears a little wooden.    So I would personally like to thank Angelina, her make-up and costume artists, and all the makers of this film for bringing this daring and beautiful secret service agent truly to life. She was stunning.     Goand see this movie and treat yourself to a fun night out.
B000024T5L|5.0|I'm going to get this as soon as I can. This was Europe's last album before they took their long break. Songs like Girl From Lebanon, and Prisoners In Paradise were the best on this album.
B002ZG9846|5.0|My wife & I loved it! Not what we expected...which was a \\"kiddie movie.\\"  The little girl is unbelievable. Foul-mouthed and tough.  Definitely for teens, but adults will love it if you like superhero type stuff.
B001PCOSVY|5.0|Wings Of Tomorrow is one of my favorate Europe songs from that period. I will be purchasing this cd soon.
B000I5X81K|3.0|State of American pop is so bad that even this pedestrian music for masses gets a lot of cheers. I need to give Josh a credit for managing to overcome lack of upper notes in his voice and producing a sound that can be enjoyable. Not in case of this album, though, because of the rather poor music material.
B00005NNMK|5.0|This is the album that put Europe(the band) on the world wide music scene. The Final Countdown, Carrie, And Rock The Night were some of the best songs I remember from the 80s. Cherokee is a really cool song too. I highly recommend this CD.
B002Z58GQI|5.0|Works great, no complaints, this is the \\"wonder bread\\" of flash drives.  Data rates are fine for the price, case seems durable.
B0000264PW|5.0|I was very happy with this CD, and it arrived just in time. I love Europe and would love to purchase more of their Cds and DVDs but I can only afford two per month.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|That Yo-Yo Ma is one of the more important cellists playing today would be an understatement. Not only is he a brilliant musician, an impeccable musicologist, and an empathetic performer who has a devoted following, he also stretches his musical borders to include projects like the Silk Road Project.  Here he approaches the music of the gifted film composer Ennio Morricone and together they have produced and album of some of the finest music written for film.  Yo-Yo Ma at times embellishes these works, at times takes the lead voice of the melodic line and at times he simply blends into the score.<br /><br />Ennio Morricone conducts the Roma Sinfonietta Orchestra and with Ma as featured artist the album opens with the famous theme from 'THE MISSION' entitled 'Gabriel's Oboe', and true to Ma's style he does not take the melody away form the oboe he instead provides embellishment.  Also from this film is 'The Falls'.  The other works on this recording include the following:<br />THE GUISEPPE TORNATORE SUITE ('The Legend of 1900', 'Cinema Paradiso', 'Malena' and 'A Pure Formality'); THE SERGIO LEONE SUITE ('Once Upon a Time in America', 'Once Upon a Time in the West', 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly'); THE BRIAN DE PALMA SUITE ('Casualties of War', 'The Untouchables'); MOSES and MARCO POLO SUITES; and  THE LADY CALIPH SUITE.<br /><br />In every way the music works well. This is a fine example of film music written and performed beautifully.  Grady Harp, January 11
0393072231|5.0|There were several reoccurring themes during the financial meltdown of 2007-08 .  They included but were not limited to:<br /><br />1. No one could have predicted the collapse of the subprime mortgage market.<br />2. The talent in the investment banks is too great to lose and therefore must be bailed out<br />3. While government should not impose any stifling regulations on the bond market, it should come to the rescue of these institutions because they are too big to fail.<br />4. The lending companies were forced by government laws to make loans to high-risk clients (read minorities) that they otherwise would not have made.<br /><br />In his book The Big Short , Michael Lewis exposes all of these as blatant lies and he does it in all way that the non-expert can not only follow but will find entertaining in a grim sort of way.  He does this by following several investors that did see the collapse coming and telling how they made a lot of money from betting against the market.  Along the way to making their fortunes these investors  take on the roll of chicken little in that they are continuously surprised that all of the \\"talent\\" on Wall street just cannot see that the market is indeed falling.  But they have a good reason.<br /> The reason no one saw the collapse coming is that it is not in their interest to see the collapse coming.  Most stood to make money from the deals whether they went bad or not.  And why not the government will foot the bill in the end anyway.  Right?<br /> This book is a must read for any one interested in how the collapse cam to be and a cautionary tale about mechanics of the subprime and how it all went down.  While this is a story that may leave you pissed offed it will defiantly leave better informed.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is so good that I couldn`t stop reading. Anyone who see`s this book anywhere possible to buy it, I encourage you to buy it. I ca not wait until &#34;The Son of Neptune&#34; comes out. ( Fall 2011)
B000N6U0E2|5.0|A poignant, inspiring film that is based on Chris Gardner's true story of overcoming huge odds to found his own highly successful investment firm. In 1981, Gardner (Will Smith) watched his business, selling bone density scanners, decline along with his marriage. He accepts an unpaid internship with Dean Witter as a chance to improve his life and his young son's, for whom he has custody. Together Gardner and his young son endure many hardships, including homelessness, as Gardner pursues his dream.
0312020309|5.0|this book is going to the next generation.  I enjoyed it as a young woman when it first came out, then my daughter enjoyed it as a young girl. Now my granddaughter will get it for her 13th birthday.<br />excellent gift for a girl reluctant to leave childhood.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This story of star-crossed lovers will lift your spirits. When an Irish guitarist meets a beautiful cellist in New York, they fall deeply in love. Their child, a musical prodigy like Mozart, runs away from his orphanage (that story is a subplot since neither parent knows he's alive...) and he sets out to find his parents through his gift of music.<br /><br />He takes the name of August Rush and so their song of faith and love and happy endings begins. The journey has a few jolts and there is a touch of Oliver Twist in the characters, but it is definitely a fun movie.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|I bought this for my teenager who loved these books. She has lost alot of interest along the way if that says anything.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is a young woman with a keen imagination and an active fantasy life. She works in a cafe where she steps into the lives of others around her to help them out...in her uniquely whimsical and romantic way.
B002JVWRAO|4.0|I am a big fan of this series. Although I do have to add there were some episodes that I didn't like.
6305428387|5.0|This movie is loosely based on a true story of a Jamaican bobsled team. When the Olympic trials for sprinters become a disaster, a group of young men from Jamaica enter the 1988 Olympics as a bobsled team. John Candy is the coach who must redeem himself. While the world watches, the team and coach become the laughingstock of the Olympic Games. Then they become an inspiration. The movie has a great soundtrack.
B0015DROBO|1.0|ALthough several of my friends raved over this book, I found it very hard to get into.  Put it down several times only to pick it up out of bordom several days later.  Made it to page 82..and that was enough for me.  This is the worst book I have tried to read in a long time, very boring.  I may think about renting the movie.
B002QKZLZ6|4.0|Although I think this product could have been designed more cleverly for the plantronics headset, it does what it's supposed to and protects the headset.  Solid material and feel.
B000MV90B2|1.0|I have no idea as to the quality of the film because the dvd that was sent was totally defective and would not play.  Do not purchase this junk.
B000001Y79|5.0|I have this on cassette, that's how long ago this came out! I love it and still play it often.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|First of all, I am not a fan of Christmas CDs. They just don't really get me that much. Would rather be singing Christmas carols than hearing them. That said, this is actually the only holiday CD that is original enough that I'll listen to it! There is a good variety of songs, from classics to new ones. Enya has a gorgeous voice that really makes the songs come alive. And the instruments suit the songs very well. Lyrics are great, though on some of them they don't really make much sense. One of my favorite songs on this album is, \\"My, My, Time Flies\\". 70's beat, very catchy. Though I don't understand the meaning of the lyrics. An apple falls in his hand? A one-way ticket to Mars? Ah well, still pretty. Another one is \\"Trains and Winter Rains\\". The beat really feels like a train tugging along. Soft, melodious.  Not all of these songs are Christmas, but it's a nice album. I definitely recommend it. Essential for people who like Celtic/holiday.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|This is a great movie for children and adults! Very entertaining. It is my one and a half year old daughter's favorite! She would watch it 10 times a day if I would allow it!!
B002ZG997C|4.0|In a post-apocalyptic world that movie fans have become accustomed to recently, Denzel Washington is trying to deliver the only known copy of the King James Bible to an unknown destination. Along the way he encounters the ruthless leader of a small town, played by the great Gary Oldman, who believes that if he can get his hands on the book, he will be able to expand his influence and consolidate his power. This was an interesting story, with the mystery of where the book is going and why it is heading there always on the viewer's mind. The questions are answered at the end with a surprising plot twist.

B001GQACGE|2.0|Bottom-Line: Ultimately, \\"I Am Sasha Fierce\\" is a highly polished, energetic, but crass offering that sadly disappoints.<br /><br />Beyonc&eacute; Giselle Knowles.  As I wrote in my review of B'Day (2006), leave off the last name and her name bespeaks beauty, grace, and eloquence; and indeed she is a most striking woman, whose music career has begot a burgeoning business empire.  But, although Ms. Knowles is a classically trained vocalist, her voice has never stood out as one of the greats in terms of dynamic range or soul-weeping beauty , but at least as part of Destiny's Child she made reasonably good music.<br /><br />The same cannot be said of her long anticipated November 2008 release \\"I Am...Sasha Fierce,\\" a two disc CD that is supposed to highlight the two very different sides of Ms. Knowles persona.  On one CD we have Beyonc&eacute;, the sweet, famine, (almost) fragile female, serenading us with songs of love scorned, and then found again, in all of its rhapsodized beauty.  On the other CD, we have a hipper, wiser, (bad) Beyonc&eacute;, or Sasha Fierce, the strong woman who would die before she let a man play her again.<br /><br />While disc (1) is soft, dare I say eloquent, sweet and ballad filled, disc (2) is hard driving, street, \\"fierce\\", with enough hip-hop musical queues to give Sasha Fierce street credentials.  It's not a stretch to state the CD was meant as a gimmick, which largely tanked with me, but apparently not with the public at large, because I Am...Sasha Fierce debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making this Ms. Knowles' third consecutive number one CD.<br /><br />I was initially attracted to the CD(s) based on the simultaneously released singles--one each from each disc--If I Were A Boy (disc 1), and from disc 2, Singles Ladies (Put a Ring on It). The simultaneously released tracks were no doubt meant to demonstrate the duality--the flip side as it were--of Beyonc&eacute;'s personae. On the one musical hand, the \\"'Beyonc&eacute;'\\" disc's admittedly poignant--and quickly answered by R Kelly among others--If I Were a Boy ascends with melodic indignation and unwavering role reversal sentiments (''If I were a boy/even just for a day...drink beer with the guys/and chase after girls...I were a boy/I think I could understand/How it feels to be a woman/I swear I'd be a better man\\").<br /><br />Meanwhile on the \\"Sasha'\\" disc, Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It), is pure girl-power sassy with bouncy hypnotically contagious hand claps and post-kicked-to-the curb bravado (\\"Kept crying my tears/For three good years/You can't be mad at me\\").  One has to wonder if Mr. Jay Z was not the subject of this high-stepping, estrogen-powered lyrical kiss-off, or if he was at least threatened by it real life equivalent, which is why Beyonc&eacute; finally got a ring on it! Indeed, I wondered if Mr. Z was the subject of Sasha Fierce's musical rants.<br /><br />The two aforementioned singles aside I Am...Sasha Fierce goes decidedly downhill.  While the Beyonc&eacute; side did have some notable ballad's--I loved the opening guitar string work on track No. 3 Disappear, and Track No. 4 Broken-Hearted Girl was laudable for its beautiful piano work--aside from the Single Ladies, the Sasha Fierce disc was mostly a disjoined, unintelligible waste.<br /><br />In other words I didn't enjoy the musical ride at all.  Buried within the Sasha Fierce disc, Beyonc&eacute;'s voice is never more than a footnote; there is just too much going on; too much noise, too many background singers, too many instruments, too much wasted energy.  On many of the tracks Beyonce does little more than screech out intelligible lyrics, and after a while this cacophony of unsavory, uninspired sounds set my nerves on edge.  Sort of like B'Day!<br /><br />Reportedly Knowles spent a year working on I Am...Sasha Fierce and co-wrote and produced over seventy songs, though only 13 made it to the tow disc (standard edition), while 19 can be had with the deluxe edition of the album.  It's a shame something more enlightened couldn't have come from that time.<br /><br />Ultimately, as intended, \\"I Am...Sasha Fierce\\" wears two faces, both of which are highly polished, and energetic, but only the Beyonc&eacute; persona works for me; Sasha Fierce mostly disappoints because when all is said, and sung, I have seen, heard, and dismissed her already as crass and sadly disappointing.  While there a few bright spots, \\"I Am...Sasha Fierce\\" is style and status over substance, which may endear the dual CD's to most of today's taste challenged young audience, but does nothing for those of us who crave something deeper and more profound, dare I say soulful in our R&B..

B001AQT11M|3.0|I had forgotten how slow and boring the beginning of this movie is. I also had forgotten the scarey parts. My daughter is only 1 1/2 so this movie scared her a little and I'm going to wait a few more months to reintroduce it to her. I'm not sure this movie will get watched much.
0143116738|2.0|This book is cute, kind of feel good. But it's 'advice'  and examples are only relevant to those who are in the beginning of their professional lives i.e. children, college students, recent graduates.   For anyone with responsibilities, looking to change their direction in life to find more fulfillment by using their 'Element' - it's completely irrelevant! None of the stories were about middle aged folk, who I would imagine are the demographic most attracted to this book because of the difficult position familial and financial responsibilities put on finding and utilizing one's passion.    Yes, geniuses and very special people can make their element work for them, but what about the rest of us? Just made me upset that I hadn't received guidance like this earlier. With bills and kids to feed, I'm stuck doing whatever comes my way in the form of employment. Yes, I sure do have an element, but it doesn't matter anymore.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|If you are a lover of Jane Austen's books and movie adaptations, then this is the video for you!  Elizabeth Gaskell's book is wonderfully adapted into a 4 hour miniseries.  Set against the gritty, grimy Industrial revolution in a fictional Lancashire mill town, love between two opposing types blossoms.  He's the gritty North, she's the gentle South.  A first disastrous proposal reveals quite a bit of pride and prejudice on both sides, but after time passes and truths are revealed, the two can find happiness.
B004B4J7H8|2.0|Since John Williams left the franchise, the Harry Potter soundtracks have been little more than average background music for the film.  The John Williams scores have the ability to stand on their own as musical compositions, but the latter ones, out of the context of the films for which they were written, make for pretty dull listening. Much like Wagner, Williams is able to take a handful of themes, and through reinstrumentation, can create a wide range of emotions and effects.  No so here.  There are virtually no recognizable themes (new or old), and the music drones on with very little to distinguish it. I have heard rumors that Williams is coming back for the final film, if this is the case, then there is something to look forward to, if not, the ONLY reason I might buy No.8 is to \\"complete the set\\" - as long as I can find a very cheap download somewhere...
B0002KVULG|5.0|First off, I just want to say, this is not a totally accurate adaptation of the novel \\"Dracula\\" by Bram Stoker, it's more of a stylistic, late 70s remake of the 1931 Bela Lugosi film that was based on the same novel. With that out of the way, let's move on. The movie opens with a sailing ship crashing ashore, with only a single living survivor, Count Dracula, who is found and rescued by Mina Harker. It turns out the Count was on his way to this town, anyway and decides to take up permanent residence at Cairfax Abbey, a castle not to far from the Harker residence. Soon after he moves in, strange things begin to happen, and I don't want to give away too much, but it is the usual Dracula fair, but with that 1970s style.<br /><br />That's all I'll give away, you have to see the rest for yourself.<br /><br />I want to say again that this isn't so much an adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel as much as it is an adaptation of the Bela Lugosi movie, if you're looking for a balls to the wall adaptation of the novel, check out Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 movie \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula,\\" which is about the most faithful adaptation you're going to get of the book. Also, side note, this movie was released the same year as Werner Herzog's remake of F.W. Murnau's \\"Nosferatu,\\" which was also based on Bram Stoker's book. I'm not quite sure, because I wouldn't be born for another seven years, but I think the two films competed against each other at the box office. On the one hand you had a remake of an unauthorized adaptation (Nosferatu), and on the other hand you had a remake of an authorized adaptation (Dracula). I'm not entirely sure, but I think they were released in the same year on purpose, as to drive up ticket sales so people might go see both of them. It's hard to tell, overall, neither of the two films (Frank Langella's Dracula or Klaus Kinski's Nosferatu) are faithful adaptations of the novel from which they are both based, but they're both darned fun movies that are good for Halloween, or just a rainy Saturday afternoon.<br /><br />All in all, I liked this version of Dracula, I'm sure if Bela Lugosi had been alive to see it, he would have been proud of Frank Langella's performance.t a rainy Saturday afternoon.    All in all, I liked this version of Dracula, I'm sure if Bela Lugosi had been alive to see it, he would have been proud of Frank Langella's performance.

B003Y3MYYU|5.0|This set, both on LP and CD, has been in the shadow of Solti's set. This is unfortunate because Bohm was a far better conductor than Solti who never went below the surface and excelled in the loud and brassy bits. Any moron who touts the Solti set as \\"the\\" Ring has obviously never listen to more than highlights (carefully chosen by John Culshaw). Bohm has the best of Solti's singers and fills in with better ones. When Hotter recorded DIE WALKURE, the voice was almost unlistenable with its dry wobble and woofiness. Theo Adam is much better. Yes, Hotter was great at one time (listen to his earlier cycles under Knappertsbusch from Bayreuth) but this wasn't the Hotter caught in the studios. Bohm's has the advantage of the spontaneous feel of a live performance whereas the Solti is studio-bound.<br /><br />If you really love the Ring, wake up and do yourself a favour. Stop being guided by those who know nothing and put your Solti on ebay then grab this set that's far better in every way.

031603438X|4.0|Got this book for Christmas and was not able to put it down til finished.  Like having a heart to heart over drinks with one of the most famous men in the world. Who knew?  Witty, insightful, loaded with rich detail, unexpectedly kind and generous, vivid strokes bring the famous names to life. The only reason I'd give it 4 stars instead of 5 was the fact that there was indeed a ghost writer. It was 100% convincing as Richards' own narrative voice, so finding that out did bum me out a little. Really a delightful book.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|A lackluster conclusion to an average trilogy.  For me the entire trilogy is excessively wordy and has too many over illustrated characters.  While the plot is intriguing, the time spent on developing the characters is overkill.  Salendar is surely a fun character to get to know though!

B0044XV3R8|2.0|The movie, of course, earns 5 stars.  This particular edition, however earns only 2 stars.  There are three versions of the movie on two discs, each version shown half on each of two discs with the third disc containing the so called Special Features which consist only of the deleted scenes which have been included in the extended versions of the movies.  The edition could have been arranged with one full version of the movie on each of the discs and the deleted scenes for each version included on that version's disc.  How easy.

B003RS5JZS|4.0|This episode caps off what is probably the best season of the show so far. I can't say much about it without spoilers, but the end of Season 4 affected me to the point that I was actually thinking about the final moment for several days, a mixture of sadness and anger, as if these characters were actually real and I knew them. I guess that's the hallmark of a good show right?
B0041KKYEW|5.0|\\"Black Swan\\" succeeds on many levels. Boldly directed by Darren Aronofsky, it is a modern fairy tale brimming with lurid twists and diabolical turns that glides seamlessly between gritty realism and a surrealist nightmare. Though it can easily be dismissed as an over-the-top backstage melodrama, it is an unflinching examination of the dark side of human performance and a richly textured fable about the dangers of single-minded ambition. At its center is a triumphant jaw-dropping performance by Natalie Portman. She is Nina Sayers, a fragile yet fiercely dedicated ballerina whose undying quest for perfection and relentless obsession to lose herself in her dream role frees her from a cloistered existence, but at the cost of her mind.<br /><br />Nina is first seen dancing the prologue of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake with great focus and precision, but it is only a dream. In the real world, she shares an apartment with her caring mother, Erica (Barbara Hershey), and dances at a prestigious ballet company in New York's Lincoln Center. Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), the company's formidable artistic director, plans to re-imagine Swan Lake for the opening performance of the new season. Upon casting out his prima ballerina and former lover, Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder), Thomas announces he is seeking a new face for the upcoming production.<br /><br />During an exclusive audition process, Nina stumbles but her determination lands her the coveted role of the Swan Queen, a physically and mentally demanding part that requires two contrasting performances. Though her flawless technique and air of innocence is ideally suited for the virginal White Swan, Thomas fears she lacks the sensuality crucial for embodying the part of the Black Swan. Fearing replacement, she plunges deeper into the part.<br /><br />Tensions escalate between her and Thomas as his criticisms become harsher and his sexual advances intensify. Nina's relationship with her mother begins to take on a new dimension as well. Erica's constant dedication to her daughter's career becomes increasingly questionable once the truth about her own dancing career boils to the surface. The cocoonlike apartment they inhabit, so safe and seemingly cozy in the beginning scenes, soon evolves a claustrophobic cage.<br /><br />Lines between reality and the dream world begin to blur as Nina's vivid hallucinations become more consistent. And with the arrival of Lily (Mila Kunis), a new dancer from the West Coast, an obscure rivalry begins to take shape. With her free-spirited technique, cool and confident personality, and ability to evoke sexuality both on and off the stage, Lily is a more natural match for the Black Swan. Thomas takes notice and quickly casts her as Nina's alternate. In Nina's eyes, she becomes an object of intense jealousy and subconscious desire.<br /><br />Aronofsky meant for \\"Black Swan\\" to be a companion piece to his previous work, 2008's \\"The Wrestler\\", a film that at first glance invites minimal comparison. Portman's ballerina and Rourke's wrestler take equally destructive paths to personal glory both ultimately seeking the approval of others over their own self-gratification. And though ballet is regarded as the highest of art forms and wrestling one of the lowest, performers in both arenas use movements of grandeur and excess to achieve their own vision of expression. In both pieces, he has brilliantly captured the tragedy of a performer with incredible depth and range.<br /><br />Though surrounded by macabre visions and flights of fantasy, \\"Black Swan\\" gains its allure and beauty from a more artistically satisfying place. Backstage dramas are not uncommon on film and it is a miracle that screenwriters Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin were able to take the familiar elements of the genre and provide them with weight and gravitas. However supreme credit must go to Darren Aronofsky for finding full creative freedom without teetering into camp or cliches. Painted in a grand style reminicient of a Roman Polanski horror movie or Dario Argento's \\"Suspiria\\", Nina's downward spiral into madness is both mesmerizing and disturbing without being gratuitous or distracting.<br /><br />Portman is nothing short of revelatory in a performance unmatched in passion or ferocity. Seemingly adrift in Aronofsky's feverish dreamland, she is always precise and never unconvincing. And though the camera is more often framing her face than her feet, her skill as a professional ballerina is never questionable (she spent ten months training for the role).<br /><br />The supporting players are faced with the daunting challenge of finding balanced duality in their roles as well. Vincent Cassel is mentor and menace effortlessly conjuring up equal amounts of respect and repulsion. He gives Thomas Leroy an intimidating force; unapologetically lecherous and arrogant yet undeniably seductive. Barbara Hershey's fearless performance as an overbearing stage mother maniacally weaves between sympathetic and monstrous. From the beginning it is apparent that something may be lurking underneath her veil of saccharine sweetness; what is revealed is profoundly heartbreaking and unsettling.<br /><br />As a competitor whose motives are never quite clear, Mila Kunis is a beguiling presence on screen. All of the charm and self-assurance from her performance in 2008's \\"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\\" is on display, but Kunis (who trained alongside Portman) unleashes a fiery eroticism and ambiguity unseen in any previous work. But it is Winona Ryder who gives the most unexpected performance. In merely three minutes of screen time, she elevates a part that at first glance feels like an obligatory cliche into a three-dimensional character whose personal tragedy is as devastating as Portman's.<br /><br />\\"Black Swan\\" could have easily become a frigid masterpiece consumed by its own style. Aronofsky wisely keeps almost all focus on Portman and is rewarded with an unforgettable performance. They are two dance partners let loose on a blank stage. Set to the haunting strains of Tchaikovsky's timeless score, their dance is a feat of great beauty and skill.cient of a Roman Polanski horror movie or Dario Argento's \\"Suspiria\\", Nina's downward spiral into madness is both mesmerizing and disturbing without being gratuitous or distracting.

B0042AEOG0|5.0|I love this Christmas album because it's different and upbeat. It makes me wanna dance, it gets me in a better mood driving to work ... it is fun. I think Mariah's videos are cheesy and I could do without the flirtatious attitude, but her voice is phenomenal and that makes up for the awkward youthfulness she tries to project. If you want a good holiday album, this is excellent.

(similar style to The Office).  I feel like this could be the next big thing since Friends.  Best of all, some episodes wrap it all up with a lesson at the end of each episode.

A great buy at this price and sound quality that cannot be improved upon short of switching to a very high priced audiophile system.

1416550534|5.0|Some of the most random discoveries end up being the best.  I was perusing Amazon.com's vast selection of books one day and \\"The House At Riverton\\" popped up in a long list of related and/or recommended reads.  After reading a synopsis as well as noting the overwhelming amount of five-star reviews, I knew I had to give it a go.  It ended up being one of my best reads of 2010 (and that's a short list).<br /><br />The book follows the early life and death of narrator Grace Bradley (n&eacute;e Reeves), a woman who served as a maid at the Riverton Manor beginning when she was 14 years old and ending in her early 20's.  The reader is continually taken back and forth in time starting in 1914, the 98-year-old Grace of the present (1998) spontaneously and vividly recollecting her life and events at Riverton and elsewhere, along with the complex histories of sisters Hannah and Emmeline Hartford.  These memories are triggered by a visit back to the old manor in addition to the inquiries of a production company that is making a film centered on the suicide of poet R.S. Hunter, Riverton's one notorious piece of history.  As the story moves from the pedantic teens to the roaring 20's, war ravages both the bodies and souls of its characters, women's lib ruffles conservative feathers, long-kept secrets are unearthed and forbidden love shatters a family forever.<br /><br />Morton is this generation's Charlotte Brontë.  Serving up a sweeping tale of love and secrets, she has all her elegant deportment and little of her languid pacing.  Though in stories like this it takes time and patience on the inevitable climb to its superlative summits, the view from above once there allows for some magnificent reflection on its fascinating and well-drawn characters.  Grace is all about conformity - her perpetual yield to the hierarchy of servant-to-master has her rarely speaking her mind, much less stepping out of line or doing something rash.  She is quiet, controlled, restrained, and harbors a deep and inexplicable loyalty to the family she serves, to the detriment of her personal life.  It is because of those traits that her powers of observation serve her to the utmost in evoking Riverton's thorny history.  One could easily compare the guilt that she carries to that of Briony Tallis in Ian McEwan's best-selling novel \\"Atonement\\"; in part responsible for the death of a love affair, she continues to serve up an illusion to the public while keeping the truth of the matter to herself until just before she passes, the facts finally revealed in almost the fashion of a literal deathbed confession.<br /><br />Hannah is the non-conformist, the rebel, the dreamer - stymied by the stiff, patriarchal push of traditionalism and the unrelenting repression of women, she longs to be liberated both in milieu and manner.  She tutors herself in secret on a trade skill and dreams of traveling the world, meeting people and expressing ideas, longing for a life of constant adventure and risk despite her predestined prospect as a meek, cosseted spouse of a well-to-do.  Emmeline is her antithesis, a flirtatious and spritely girl who gobbles attention and affection, wholeheartedly embraces her femininity and is more than happy to be coddled and contained by a man's clout and capital.<br /><br />Several parts of the novel contain some wonderful quotes that can stand on their own, such as Grace's views on grandchildren: \\"While one's child takes a part of one's heart to use and misuse as they please, a grandchild is different.  Gone are the bonds of guilt and responsibility that burden the maternal relationship.  The way to love is free.\\" (pg. 244)<br /><br />The description of a long-married couple's dissolved zeal is nearly as affecting: \\"Estella Luxton smiled tolerantly at her husband and between them passed a type of unspoken communication born of years of joint existence.  In that moment's glance I perceived their marriage as one of practical endurance.  A symbiotic relationship whose usefulness had long outlived its passion.\\"  (pg. 283)<br /><br />Bottom line: The world of literary fiction is fickle; today's best-selling author is all too quickly yesterday's success story, but Morton has staying power, impressing and captivating with her keen sense of character, refined voice and layered storytelling.  If you liked \\"Atonement\\", then \\"The House At Riverton\\" comes highly recommended.ts passion.\\"  (pg. 283)    Bottom line: The world of literary fiction is fickle; today's best-selling author is all too quickly yesterday's success story, but Morton has staying power, impressing and captivating with her keen sense of character, refined voice and layered storytelling.

B00139XTG4|2.0|Thomas Kuhn in the History of Scientific Revolutions described the effects of anomalies in systems, regardless of whether one \\"sees\\" them or not. Sometimes one simply needs a new lens or filter to view a variable always there. Newtonian physics, which breaks down as an explanation of relativistic phenomena, becomes a functional part of Einsteinian physics when new variables (such as space-time) are revealed by logic and experimentation. In Frameworks: Conflicts in Balance, I described how Kuhn's observations apply not only to scientific frameworks, but to any framework, whether physical and metaphysical. Relevance becomes a mechanism (i.e. a lens or filter) of the human brain. Evolution itself depends on the application of some variables (such as genes) that turn on and turn off under appropriate circumstances.     Every framework contains a cluster of variables, rules, anomalies, zones of freedom and limits. In other words, Black Swans are simple anomalies, and a mere part of a larger framework dynamic. This observation began not with Taleb, but with the Greeks. Curiously, Taleb never even refers to Kuhn, or to those before him who observed many other characteristics related to change.     So I found Taleb's self-aggrandizing tome excessive in a number of ways. Each page was a celebration of ... Taleb, of how he was smarter than everyone in the universe, how everyone who failed to appreciate him was an idiot. While the idea of the Black Swan is a good one, it's not new. The unnecessary and hyperbolic jargon he applies (such as Extremistan) simply serves to confuse even sympathetic readers. As I recall from my college days, when you can't explain something simply, you dazzle them with BS. The book needs a filter --- there's too much Taleb and too few swimming birds.      I had great expectations for the book. But I just couldn't get past the ego. [[ASIN:059531824X Frameworks: Conflict in Balance]]

B000JBWWRY|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />Walt Disney's 1953 animated film \\"Peter Pan\\" is one of several films that helped build a sterling reputation for the company's feature-length animation.  With the voice talents of Bobby Driscoll, Hans Conried, and Kathryn Beaumont, it remains timeless entertainment.<br /><br />An adaptation of the James M. Barrie story, it boasts artistic, sophisticated animation that holds up brilliantly even compared to the contemporary computer-animated market.  For instance, Peter Pan's first appearance, crouching in darkness on a rooftop, suggests the character's magical nature and even a subtle hint of the unknown and the potential for danger.  The relationship between Peter, Wendy, Michael, and John gives the movie tremendous heart.  Peter's companion sprite Tinkerbell is also meticulously drawn and animated, and has garnered her own place in Disney lore.  Bobby Driscoll's vocal work as Peter Pan is one of the finest, most recognizable voices in Disney's canon of characters.  It is a perfect blend of mischief, stubborness, and most importantly, youth.<br /><br />Hans Conried does double duty as the villain Captain Hook and Mr. Darling, father to Wendy, Michael, and John.  In an animated setting, it is impossible to imagine anyone else in these roles.  Mr. Conried voices the fussy father very well, and as Captain Hook creates one of Disney's classic villains.  His characterization is silkily evil, but he is also able to play the more comical side of the character.<br /><br />Kathryn Beaumont is perfection as Wendy, a potent mixture of authority and genuine care in her voice.  As one of the few female characters from that earlier Disney era who wasn't a princess, the character of Wendy is very interesting.  Emotionally strong and wise, Wendy Darling is one of Disney's best female animated characters.<br /><br />Also featuring great songs like \\"You Can Fly\\" and \\"Following The Leader,\\"  Walt Disney's \\"Peter Pan\\" is one of the golden masterpieces from the company.

B0040QYROA|5.0|Metropolis is a classic, but for years has been seen in heavily edited forms. For a long time as much as one-quarter of the film was considered lost. In 2008 a print came to light in Buenos Aires that had 25 minutes of footage not seen for decades. The Kino \\"Complete\\" Metropolis runs 148 minutes, probably as close to the 153 minute premiere as we will get. A fine job from Kino, and worth watching. The original musical score by Gottfried Huppertz adds to the film. Well done!
B0011UF79C|5.0|This film, as a film, is wonderful.  I fully agree with the praise slathered on this film by others.  I would add one other reason for buying this film.  Much of the film was shot in the Marin County Court House designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, perhaps America's pre-eminent architect, and completed after his death.  It is an extraordinary building and, while built in the 50's, stands in quite realistically for the near future of Gattaca.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I am a huge fan of Ever 17, which, like 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors, was written by Kotaro Uchikoshi. Because of this, I had very high expecations for this title, and it did not disappoint. What I appreciate the most about this game is how seamlessly the puzzles are integrated with the game's story. I felt so immersed while working out each challenge, and it was always difficult to stop playing. The script and the mythology of the game were wonderfully created, and everything about it manages to feel real, even though it's only a DS game. I also felt very attached to the characters, and it was sometimes devastating to see someone die, especially if it was my fault. My only real complaint is that the game could use some voice acting, but it's incredibly involving regardless. I recommend this game to adult puzzle and adventure game fans everywhere.<br /><br />(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

B0025UHKNS|1.0|Most of the other reviewers have done a wonderful job listing the pro's of this watch.     I agree with nearly every positive aspect of the positive reviews.    There is just one problem - they really do not expose the one tremendous negative of the watch - the \\"touch bezel\\".    Touch bezel is a misnomer. It would be much more accurate to call it the touchless bezel. Literally. If you sweat heavily when you run (I sweat approximately 1 lb per mile), this watch will lock up and become totally useless on EVERY long run. It doesn't require contact with anything other than your sweat. Some other reviewers have remarked that you can \\"just wipe off the sweat\\" and it will be good to go. Not true if it has been exposed to a significant amount of sweat. It requires 30-60 seconds of drying with an absorbent media (towel, paper, dry shirt) to regain functionality. The only option is to lock out the bezel no later than mile 2 of the run and keep it locked out until you have thoroughly dried it. Once the watch is soaked, unlocking the bezel, even for a couple of seconds, will start rapid, random actuation of the menu functions. At that point, the best alternative is to immediately re-lock the bezel and live with whatever random screen the watch is showing.    Unfortunately, I did not purchase this watch from Amazon. All though RR Sports had a great deal on the watch, I had kept the watch too long by the time my routine distances were long enough to lock it up on every run.    If you never plan to run more than 2 miles at a time and sweat like I do, this watch is a great purchase. By the time I reach 3 miles into a summer run, an unlocked bezel is at least 50% likely to lock the watch up. 4 Miles is at least a 90% lockup probability. I've never had it last 5 miles.    Needless to say, it was almost useless when I ran the 2010 Detroit FREEP 1/2 marathon!!
B0044XV3R8|3.0|I bought this DVD thinking the movie is on one disc. Wrong. The movie is on two different discs so you have to get up in the middle of the movie to change the disc. Why did they pack half a disc with bonus features and the other half with half a movie? Would've it been smarter to put all bonus features on one disc and then the movie on another? Fortunately, the first disc stops at a good point with no cliffhangers. This pauses gives you a break but i'd rather have the movie on one disc. I recommend getting a different version.

031603438X|4.0|Keith Richards' memoir Life is aptly titled.  As he mentions in the book, he sleeps on the average of about two days a week, so he's been awake for about three life times.  Despite his drugged out persona, Mr. Richards has the amazing capacity to recount every detail of his life in great detail.  The Stones and Mr. Richards' life story has already been extensively documented, but what makes this book so entertaining is not any ground breaking revelations, but the laid-back, shoot from the lip style it is written in.  You feel like you're sitting in a room with Mr. Richards' as he reminisces about his life and just generally shoots the breeze.  He pulls no punches about anything from his childhood, to his drug use to his relationship with Mick Jagger to just about anything.  Even if you are not a fan of the Stones, this book will keep you entertained with Mr. Richards' incredible, weird and amazing life's journey.

I knew about the books, knew everyone was raving about them, but I just couldn't bring myself to read them.  At first, the book didn't seem to appeal to me.  The summary seemed to TV Survivor for me and the hype that was going around with the books made me cringe that they wouldn't live up to my expectations.  Yet, I created a poll letting you--my blog readers--decide if I should read it as my first series of the year to review.  I admit that I complained to my family that The Hunger Games was in the lead.  I just knew that if this series was the winner of the poll, I would have to suffer through 3 books of reading that I would despise.  After the poll closed, and The Hunger Games was the clear winner, I dug out my copies of the books and started to read.<br /><br />Can I just say one thing? What the heck was I thinking???<br /><br />I can't believe I waited and dragged my feet about reading this book! By the end of the first chapter, I was so engrossed in this story that I could not put it down.  I barely set it down long enough to go on Twitter and tell everyone I was so stupid for not reading it!  The adventure, the suspense, the writing--all of it was amazing!  Each chapter seemed to end with a bigger climatic finish than the last.  I cried, cheered and my heart broke into a million pieces several times over in this book.  I absolutely fell in love with Peeta from the moment his eyes teared up on the train.  I loved Katniss from the moment she opened her mouth in the first chapter.  When it comes to Rue, my heart broke for her and I wanted to pick flowers for her as well.<br /><br />What more can I say about this book to convince you that you have to read it?  I was once a reader who kept saying that I would never read this series. If this is you, then I will tell you to read it! I was one of those people who didn't believe it would live up to the hype and thought it sounded boring.  Now I am a fellow hard core fan of this series and I still have two more books to go.

B000ZELISO|2.0|This is not a review of the movie but of the blu ray. I have a Samsung player (firmware is the latest version) and when I inserted the disc the bonus pop ups would display regardless of any settings. I have now found the post in the forums entitled \\"Blu-ray bonusview problems\\" which has a successful workaround. I also had a rough time navigating the menus as the selection color is difficult to be seen so it took a few times to apply the workaround successfully.     My issue is that I needed a workaround which I didn't find until I went searching. I've had this issue before with a different disc and it's frustrating to me to have such a terrible out of the box experience. If I was my mom or someone who is used to movies just playing they'd have a terrible time trying to watch the blu ray.     Before I knew of the workaround I watched the DVD but it was with a fair bit of frustration and disgust in the product. I paid for blu ray and want blu ray.

Even though he'd seen this movie in theaters, he was very happy to have the DVD for his library, as he said this was the best movie he'd seen all year. He goes to lots of movies (and is something of a movie buff), so that is high praise indeed. Oh, and he's already watched it (again) several times in the couple of weeks he's had it. What more can I say?
0316098337|5.0|Wow! You would never believe that something seen from a 6 year olds eyes could be so powerful. This book will grab you & not let go! You become so connected with this mother & son that even after finishing the book, there's still doubts that they will be alright.The admiration I felt for this mother that taught her son under the most horrific of circumstances is boundless. I finished it wanting more....
B000002AGM|5.0|Hard to believe that this recording, which dates from late 1957, is still subject to reviews by mere mortals.  As a delighted owner since it first appeared on Lp, and having watched its progress through cover changes, the atrocious first CD release, etc., etc., I thought it was above and beyond any criticism by now.  I bought a new CD of it from Amazon recently to give to an eleven-year-old beginning trumpet student, and was, therefore, tapped to review it.  I have read several of the ***** reviews on this site, and they've pretty much got it covered, especially the reviewer who gave it **********.  There's nothing more to say.
B002ZG981E|4.0|I do not yet have a Blue-Ray player but got this combo so I could watch the movie regardless. But, whereas all videos I've ever bought have extras on them, in this case there is absolutely NOTHING on the DVD disk. Zero, Nada. If you do not have a BR player then you cannot view anything other than the movie.    I don't know if the regular DVD only has extras, but I didn't expect this one not to. At least they could have warned me. I view this as a rip off even though once I get the BR player I'll be able to see the extra's disk.    Other than that the movie and sound are great, theater quality. Plus, if you like doing so, you can download a digital copy of the movie to your iPod, or PC, etc, but only to one device. Personally I do not watch movies like this on anything less than a large screen TV.
B000M53GM2|4.0|This was the first \\"Bond\\" film I saw in theaters.<br /><br />It's a pretty solid film from start to finish, and this DVD is a good version of it.
B004EKCNMA|1.0|I found this movie to be really creepy, not at all for small kids.  If I were a dis I would have been scared to pieces and had nightmares.  The spirits were weird and not at all like Dickens wrote.  The animation is interesting, but off putting, and although I have never been a Jim Carey fan, this is not his best or worst effort.  All in all the movie is creepy, that is the best word I can use to describe it, it made me uncomfortable.  A Christmas Carol is supposed to be about lessons leered from our mistakes, not something that sends you running away from it as fast as you can.  All of the retellings of this story in all of it's versions this is the by far the worst.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|I did not get to watch the first season of \\"LOST\\" until it came out on DVD.  I had to work on the night it was on.<br /><br />Let's just put it this way, after watching that first season I actually changed my work schedule for season two.  Yes, it's that good.<br /><br />But that's not what someone looking at this set is interested in.  If you're looking at this set you already know the show is the greatest in the history of TV.<br /><br />So I'll just say this...the boxed set is a \\"LOST\\" fans dream.  Not only is every disc perfectly made, the packaging itself reveals so many things and hides so many secrets.  Can you find the hidden bonus disc that is buried somewhere in the package???<br /><br />Five stars, a great set.
B000YAA68C|5.0|This movie is amazing! I ordered it from Amazon a few days before Christmas as it was a present for my boyfriend. It's his favorite movie, that's why I decided to give it to him in a stocking. Though I had never seen it I, fell in love with it after the first time.<br />I recommend it! :-)
0399156577|5.0|I, for one, enjoyed this book very much.  It was exciting, funny, romantic and suspenseful.  Excellent in my opinion.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|The above product (DVD Movie) arrived in a very short length of time which, first of all, really impressed me. It was packaged like a new movie and it played entirely just fine.    I am a very,very,very,very satisfied customer. I will continue to give you my business in the future.  Keep doing what you do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002ZG98C8|4.0|Many reviews of this movie have had some valid points but you have to understand, this is a Robert Rodriguez film. His films don't really surprise you these days. Watching one of his movies is like listening to Def Leppard. Most of what they did sounded the same but it sounded good.<br />This is an action film with a few good one-liners and I'll be fair and give it 3-4 stars with a recommendation to buy it if you are a Rodriguez fan. Don't expect ground breaking stuff here but expect a fair action flick that is a bit exagerated and you'll be fine.<br />The reg. edition comes with an audience soundtrack and that made watching it a second time worth the time. This is where a viewing in a theater was recorded and every time a funny thing happened or big action scene happened, you can hear the audience reactions.<br />Political plot? I wouldn't say they went out of their way to make a political point in this film. Deniro played a character that was running for a position (in Texas) that the topics of illegal aliens and jobs etc would be big ticket issues and he takes a one sided position that wasn't popular. It was his character. That's the way I saw it.<br />Some good dialogue:<br />Machete - \\"Machete don't text.\\" when he is yelled at by Alba that he could have text'd her.<br />Cheech (Priest) - \\"It's not safe for you to be here.\\" Machete - \\"You're right.\\" Cheech - \\"No. It's not safe for ME for you to be here. Get the F out!\\"<br />It was good to see Jeff Fahey doing a bigger budget film these days. He is a better actor than he gets credit for.
0143039482|4.0|One of my very favorite novels is EAST OF EDEN, so I was especially curious to read this, his last novel.  I couldn't devour it fast enough.  The story of WASP-y Ethan, Mary and their small suburban town immediately gripped me and I was thoroughly captivated by Steinbeck's style of prose.  The dialogue crackled with wit...the descriptive passages and storytelling all insightful and artistically composed.  A real pleasure to read.<br /><br />The disturbing course on which Ethan embarks, though both personal choice and circumstance, gets a little muddied in Part II but nevertheless my intent interest remained.  I was born shortly after the time in which this is set (1960), so many of the references and mindsets rang so very clearly to the way I recall from my childhood.  Yet, the lessons of morality remain completely relevant.
0316044938|5.0|Well, this book obviously has nothing to do with The Road by Carma McCarthy so I'll just get that comparison out of the way from the start. It is not a story of the love between  father and son or  mother and daughter. It is a love that lives on when the person is permanently removed. It is about those whose love will undergo changes but will never change. Ms. Sebold is a gifted story teller indeed. She uses the victim as the narrator but unlike other books suffering this plot line, where the victim holds revenge or anger, Susie Salmon does neither. The plot is pretty typical by now, victim was chosen by a serial killer that has a perchance for rape and violence but presents to the world as a humble and simple man. *Yawn*. But when Ms. Sebold set it to pen and paper it took on a remarkable change. Much of it was more believable to me and that made it a book that I will read again, just like The Road or Daisy Fae and Magic Man. I am well aware of the changes that occur within a family when an act of violence is visited upon a child. My sister was violently raped at 13 in 1979 in a small city. Up until that time, life was normal for us. Although she wasn't killed at the time of violent rape she took her own life 8 years later. It seemed that during those 8 years we were waiting the violence that had been done to her to end, like holding our breaths and hoping find a way out as a family so we could resume our lives. After her death the family's fate was sealed. Every single experience refers back to the event that ended up defining my sister: a life that in truth ended at 13. Perhaps my personal history is the reason that I've become intolerant of plot lines by naive but sensationalist writers. I undertook this book with much reservation expecting much of the same bunch of baloney. I found instead an author with perception and depth.<br /><br />In this book the character who are affected directly by Susie's death all take on the different tiers of mourning. Her father, Jack, exhibits the personal reflection of failure to protect or to have been able to have foreseen the events in time to have changed the death event. Her mother, Abigail, is denying the event and she is running so fast that she cuts all ties. Her sister, Lindsey, is stepping into her sister's shoes until she realizes she has become herself and she can manage to move forward. Her brother, Buckley, is the anger stage; the refusal to acknowledge the finality of death and the changes it brings. Her first and only budding romance, Ray Singh, represents the 'if only' phase. Her Grandma Lynn is the accepting phase. While Ray Singh's mother, Ruana Singh is the revenge phase. And Ruth Connors, the girl who is haunted by Susie in the storyline, give voice to the underlying memories that those of us carry ever second of the day after the violent deed has changed our lives forever. She is the lasting and living proof that a violent act ripples through society endlessly even when we by standers are unaware of the act.<br /><br />I was grateful that Ms. Sebold didn't set out to redeem the perpetrator's, George Harvey's motivations and actions, although at times I was fearful the story line was falling that way. Rather she simply told the story-history in glimpses and left George's motivations and actions unexplored.<br /><br />I also applauded that every character was flawed and their redemption was held within their flaws. This book was well written, engaging, and memorable. I will be following this author's future progress.xhibits the personal reflection of failure to protect or to have been able to have foreseen the events in time to have changed the death event.

0760335540|5.0|I have owned a lot of different cars and done a lot of wrenching on all of them, so I have had experience with a lot of shop manuals and \\"how to\\" books.  This book blows them all away.  My biggest problem is usually with the breadth of information and the quality of the drawings and pictures.  This book contains very thorough write-ups for all of the included projects and extremely detailed COLOR pictures!  I dropped the drive train in a 1990 911 last year using a normal shop manual, and it was almost worthless.  I wish I had know about the 101 Projects book for 911s then!  With all of the projects covered in 101 Projects, I don't really even feel like I need a separate workshop manual for the Boxster.  The only problem is that the book is of such high quality and is so pretty, I almost feel like I should get a second copy.  That way I'll have one to take out to the garage to get dirty, so I can keep this one on the coffee table for everyone to see.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has a Boxster or is considering buying one.  I have a buddy who just bought a 2003 Boxster S and he is getting this book for his birthday!
B002N5N5LG|4.0|Great show. Loved it since day one. The packaging is cool, fun and unique. Snagged this for a great deal on black friday and wanted to see how the picture quality would hold up. IT is good but not great. Waiting for a HD version of it on blu ray in the future. Fast shipping and great delivery by Amazon like always.
B00474IVGA|5.0|For starters, I have to say WOW!  I have not heard such a incredible soundtrack since \\"Coal Miner's Daughter,\\" and that was thirty-one years ago!  Let's hope that Gwyneth Paltrow is honored in the same way as Sissy Spacek, who played Loretta Lynn in Coal Miner's Daughter, for Best Actress by the Academy Of Motion Pictures.  Both actresses are phenomenal in every role that they play, and now Gwyneth has shown the entertainment industry that she can belt out a good 'ole country song as well!
B0043CJ8AY|3.0|Why do bands change up what works..??  Hands all over is a good record no doubt and a few of the songs straight up jammm! But, half the songs on there are ballads..  The songs that rock are funkier and seem to be a trend rendered from the previous album.  Songs about Jane is one of my favorite all time records (a top ten).  It has some funkiness and some bluesiness too (just a few ballads).  This band is evolving and they are still good for making some good music.  Hard to compare stuff against Songs about Jane, though.    3.5 stars and a good effort
B000FC2PKG|5.0|I love all of Lisa Gardner's books. This was no exception and it kept me going through the night until I was finished.
B004B4RCDE|2.0|I got this album as a gift.. and I ocassionally will get off of my hard-rock roots and enjoy some R and B (even the modern stuff)..  Rihanna is edgy, and different; this is why I like her.  She's not afraid to take non-typical chances with her style and music.  Ok, this album was a let-down for me.  A few of the songs are great, but the rest are noisy and lack much of a melody.  Also, I can do with-out the occasional rapper interlude in a random song (on any album).  E.G. - Eminem, Akon, Nelly etc. etc..  Too many synthesizers on this record..  She should let her guitar player (Nuno Bettencourt) do plenty of writing on her next set of tracks.  My boy can lay it down.. This record just barley gets 2.5 stars..  So, I wouldn't buy it; I would only download the radio hits (the rest is sucky).    I look for more of this edgy direction which Rihanna is going, she should get away from Reggae, and the traditional worn-out R and B stuff which is so Miley Cirus these days..  And, stop with all the Zoom a doom doom synthesizers..  Rihanna: see Gwen Steffani for a well built, creative, melodic, and edgy R and B record.
B003VQM2M4|2.0|Listened to Palaces of Montezuma on the Current.  I thought just a terrific song so ordered the whole album.  Never again will I purchase a album without listening to more tracks.  Awful.

B0041KKYEW|5.0|Whether it be positive or negative, critics and general public alike had a lot to say about Darren Aronofsky's 'Black Swan,' a ballet acid fantasy bathed in darkness. The film's central star, Natalie Portman received, for the first time in her career, a great deal of Oscar buzz for her role. This is understandable, given how doggedly dedicated and passionate she clearly was in emanating a ballerina on the brink.      This ballerina on the brink is Nina, a doe-eyed innocent and supremely fragile young woman who's dedicated her life to the dance. Nina is obviously unstable from the get-go, but 'Black Swan' sends her on a true descent into madness. Her company's artistic director, Thomas Leroy (a venomously manipulative Vincent Cassel) is staging a 'new age' production of the classic Swan Lake, intending to cast one girl as both the White and Black Swans. He is confident in Nina's capability of portraying the elegant, virginal White Swan, but is reluctant to believe she has the sensuality and conviction to pull off her evil twin, the Black Swan. Nina is desperate for the part, subtly and continually attempting to convince Thomas so, but she's further threatened by the entrance of Lily (Mila Kunis, also a noteworthy performance), a sexy, free-spirited Californian who may unintentionally sweep the title right out from under her.      Coming home to a madly repressive, suffocating mother (played to perfection by Barbara Hershey) is no help; Nina's sugar pink bedroom closely resembles that of a young child's, filled with piles of stuffed animals and music boxes. Things intensify even further when Nina finally is in fact awarded the part, presumably at the expense of aging, deeply resentful ballerina Beth getting the boot (Winona Ryder, recalling 'Girl, Interrupted').     It's at this point that Nina begins to fear that she is being stalked or haunted by someone or something; whether it be Thomas and Lily forging deeper relationships with unclear intentions, Beth's cryptically sadistic commentary or her mother's aggressive attempts to control and infantilize her, she feels a great deal of darkness closing in on her heart and mind, which ultimately and inevitably brings her closer to her own dark side.     'Black Swan' rides very fine lines between thriller, drama, and macabre horror. A vast majority of the film is psychological, and whether certain events are real or imagined are oftentimes left up to the viewer. Psychological movies can overwhelm and confuse, but 'Black Swan' mystifies and captivates, from beginning to end. An enormous contributing factor is indeed Natalie Portman's performance; the yearning loneliness she exudes as Nina is devastatingly real, and audiences will connect with her, even as they hope for her, lose faith in her, and fear for her. Its approach may at times be over-the-top, but 'Black Swan' makes its point and leaves its mark; topped off with an exquisite ending sequence, it'll follow you out as you leave the theater.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I really happy with this purchase. I concur with 5 star reviews for product. I purchased [[ASIN:B001XURPQS Canon EOS Rebel T1i 15.1 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3-Inch LCD and EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens]] and use this bag for the same. There is plenty of room for storing misc items as well. This is the first time I am buying a product with an Amazon label on it and they did not disappoint.
0061537969|5.0|If you have ever had a dog you will have fun with this book.  Yes, it's a bit predictable but that's okay.  I like a happy ending.  And you needn't be into auto racing to enjoy it.  Buy it!
0811870413|5.0|I have every authoritative book generally available regarding bread baking.  I have made all our own bread at home for nearly 30 years using a sourdough starter. I bought this book to feed my cookbook addiction but was skeptical it would add much to my knowledge of the subject.  Wrong!  This book may well have the most extensive discourse on natural yeast in print. It is understandable, well written and entertaining with clear instructions with plenty of step-by-step photos--a beautiful, high-quality book.  Although I have used sourdough for decades, I didn't know how to manipulate it to get the results I wanted. Now I do. This culinary masterpiece has taken my bread baking to a new level.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Zepp in DTS audio. Yes it's that good. Some complained about effects and camera angles but there is little of that footage, and a lot of Plant and Page just getting down, Live! with a great remaster. My favorite Zepp discs. Only wish it had Hey what I'd do.
0307272702|5.0|Gary Taube says over and over in this book that the ideas he's presenting are not new. The studies he cites, indeed, cover the past 200 years of science in the field. I am grateful that he wrote the book, though, because it's so helpful to counter the rest of the erroneous \\"nutrition and health\\" advice that's out there. There need to be more voices with this message, since it's quite obvious that what we're doing now as a nation is not working.     I started a paleo inspired diet last summer, fell off the wagon, and then restarted it 3 weeks ago. Reading this book yesterday did quite a lot to reinforce that what I'm doing is right for my health. Reading the actual science of what happens when consuming a carb-intensive meal, well - I will have that to think about any time I'm feeling even mildly tempted by the mac and cheese. :)    What is surprising to me is the level of negativity aimed at anyone who actually puts these ideas forth. It shouldn't be emotional, this is just science plain and simple, no moral judgments attached.    Some have said the book was too \\"dumbed down\\" for them, but I found it to be straightforward, positive, and only \\"dumbed down\\" in that it was put in lay terms instead of scientific terminology. Huge thanks go to Taube for writing something so well researched, and publishing it whether controversial or not.
B003D0ZNM4|5.0|The positive reviews on this album were accurate: I enjoy the CD a lot.  The product arrived quickly, sold for a good price and I am happy with the deal at all points.
B001JNNDDI|5.0|This movie is on my top ten lists of favorites, I watch it about every year or two and it is always enjoyable. Yes, it has language. No, I do not suggest it for anyone under 17, besides, they wouldn't appreciate it like adults would. The grandpa, Alan Arkin, plays a character who is funny and essentric, despite his vulgar mouth and helps make the movie what it is. It actually is a feel-good movie that shows the disgrace in child beauty contests. But in the movie, like it could in normal family-life, things go wrong and fall apart, but the family pulls together. Some people might not like the movie because they do not get it or perhaps because they are too bothered by the language, which can be a bit harsh (or at least by my standards).
B00129H7VS|5.0|Great collection of our nations history portrayed. Blu-ray is the best way to see it too. Buy this... you won't be disappointed.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|A WONDERFUL animated story.  Fun for kids, but really connects with adults too.  Excellent story with a positive message.
0439023521|4.0|This was a great book. It usually takes me quite a while to finish a book for leisure if I finish it at all, but once I picked this book up, it was hard for me to put it down and I finished it in about 3 days. It's full of twists and turns and is completely unpredictable. I often found myself expecting one thing to happen when another thing entirely different did. The only short comings of this book is a few parts in the middle. At some points I found myself reading a book where nothing is really happening. The plot was just slowly pulling itself along, and I was getting a little bored. However, if you can get past these few small parts you'll find a great book. I'm already planning on buying the sequel Catching Fire very soon.
B002ZG981E|2.0|I love Christopher Nolan!!! Truly . I own all of his films but the first Batman film (which is very good) . Perhaps i'm too old ? My wife and i really anticipated watching this film on Blu-ray . The Mrs. wanted to stream it but i felt i'd need the subtitles to keep up with the many characters (great cast) and twists . We made it about 70 minutes into the picture when we turned toward each other for the last time (my wife and i) and laughed . Out-of-there . We had lost interest in everything about the film (particularly the characters) who were not developed at all (in our opinion) . I've seen over four decades of pretension on film . Save it for someone who cares . Even the favorable critics on R.T's have only faint praise for it . If you're really smart and you \\"got it\\" , bully for you . We're stunned this is being considered for so many awards ? To each their own .
B0038QMREK|5.0|timely and in the shape promised.  they even gave me a free mp3 download... kinda ironic because at the top it said, long live physical media.\\"  Well make up your mind!
B0015DROBO|3.0|I liked the book enough to finish it. However, I got a little tired of reading 30 kindle pages at a time of family history that was unimportant to the story. What I am talking about actually does have an effect, but goes on too long. Also, the title lead me to believe it would be about the books best character, Lizbeth. Sorry, wrong answer. It follows a middle aged horn dog I found to not have a single redeeming quality. Lizbeth comes and goes like a girlfriend that only wants you around to pay for dinner. She hooks up with the horn dog more than half way through and I suspect that is the only reason she gets due presence in the story. Anyways, the end is no surprise, and wasn't exciting enough to have sat through the rest of it. I liked Lizbeth Salander, and quickly realized I only read the story through to see her kick ass and take names.
B000002L68|5.0|A classic Prince album! Never gets old for me and I love hearing the songs because it re-creates images of the movie for me.  I wish Prince would have added the other artists', who were in the movie, songs but he's Prince! He does whatever he feels! :-)
B003Q6D1YW|1.0|I am extremely annoyed that I fell for all the hype surrounding this contrived piece of crap!  First off, there is absolutely nothing \\"suspenseful\\"  or \\"thrilling\\" about it.  I kept waiting and waiting for it to get better, or even interesting for that matter, but it never did.  It's central premise and big reveal were so anti-climatic that I couldn't understand why anyone would waste 1 1/2 hours on this pathetic example of fake filmmaking.  I think the filmmakers are laughing all the way to the bank because they pulled a fast one on all us unsuspecting fools!  I don't believe a single frame of this garbage!!!
031603438X|1.0|I bought \\"Life\\" within minutes of reading the front-page book review in the Sunday New York Times.  Exciting, encyclopedic, revealing...let out a little of the rock star in all of us.  What a crock.  Here are the two big revelations in the first 130 pages:  1.  \\"Keif\\" is an old family name, and not made up by fans.  2.  Mick plays a mean harmonica.  Wow.  I can hardly stand with the excitement.  The prose is plain at best, and often worse.  Any even casual fan of the Stones over the last 20 years knows there were drugs, music, Keith-Mick tension, women.  I didn't need to spend $17.95 and a couple of hours of reading to be told that.  There's no insight, no analysis, self or otherwise, nothing particularly interesting except a scatter-brained chronology of mostly unhygenic anecdotes.  Spend your time and money on \\"Cleopatra\\" (another recent, and considerably more accurate, NYT front-page review) or a nice walk in the woods, or just listening to some of the classic Stones tracks, and you'll be better served.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|As the son of a World War II Marine combat veteran of the Pacific, I'd have to completely disagree with those who complain about the \\"inchoherent plot line, brutality and sex\\" of the series. The story line is only incoherent if you don't pay attention--the Pacific war was a lot more complicated than in Europe and lasted a lot longer. The brutality of the series is spot on from Leckie's and Sledge's memoirs, not to mention William Manchester's and many others. More specifically to me, it correlates almost exactly to what my dad told me about his experiences, and I'm positive he didn't tell me the worst, but what he did tell me was horrific enough. As Bill Guarnere (from BOB fame) said to one of the producers, \\"The Pacific, now that was really tough.\\" This from a guy who lost a leg in the war. As for the sex, I remember the sex scene in BOB quite well, so I'm not sure what the complaint really is. I understand many would appreciate a whitewash of just how inhuman the Pacific war was, and think every American soldier is a boy scout, but it is clear that they are not--especially when the horrors of combat strain their humanity to the breaking point. In some ways, that is what is best about the series--how it shows the slow (or fast) process of men breaking under the strain of combat. Sledge starts out so eager and gung ho, and comes back an inch from a broken man. Yet, somehow he was able to pull himself together and lead a worthwhile and productive life. My dad had nightmares for over a decade after the war, and I believe he had his last malaria attack in the late 1950s, but he too was a contributing member of society and a good citizen. I have watched the series with all my children, and am so thankful that my dad's war finally has started to get serious attention in popular culture.
B0024RIMBG|2.0|If you like to see an hour of up close videography of women's lips, teeth and toungues, then this video is for you.  If you are not bothered by your husband watching pretty women sing with their chests hanging out, then you will enjoy this.  I did not enjoy it, and found it offensive.  I did not appreciate their dresses with breasts hanging out, or low cut dresses.  The violinist does not wear a slip so at times, if she is in the right light you can see-through her dress.  Very immodest and offensive.  They have such sweet voices, but all that sweetness is turned to trash by the what they wore.  I did not appreciate my husband receiving this as a gift.  Why put a stumbling block in front of a man?
B002AR9YPI|4.0|I wasn't really sure what to expect with Grizzly Bear. I know they been in Rolling Stone a few times, but I always blew them off. I decided to cave in and listen to this album. I really liked the fact that the used one of the singers from Beach House to do background vocals on this album. This album sort of reminded me of Fleet Foxes Album from a year ago. I really liked the gentle tempo to most of the tracks. The leaders singers vocals were really good. I always love hearing a great singer. I thought cheerleader was an interesting track and I liked Two weeks as well. I really think this band will be bigger in the years to come. They remind me alittle of the beach boys on a few tracks. This is defiantely good quality music to listen to!
B0014VQGX4|5.0|We have a lot of bruder toys. Generally we like them. I really feel that their smaller toys are their best. the thickness of the plastic is the same for all of them, so the smaller toys are relatively more durable. this and the skid steer loader are 2 of the better (and cheaper) ones we've bought. I wish the larger toys were made of thicker plastic; of they could just reduce the scale of all of thier toys. Fun in the snow, and will be more fun on the beach.
0525951652|5.0|This was honestly one of the best books I have ever read. I was surpised to see a few negative reviews, although overall it has been rated highly which I think it definately deserves.     My favourite book is Pillars of the Earth and this one comes in close.  Although the two cannot be compared as they are set in such different time periods.      I am not a history buff but I love how this book taught me about WWI (which I have always felt naive about).  Really looking forward to the next installment!
B003BKF696|2.0|The unrelenting miserable overtones on this album killed it for me. I know you're not listening to the National to get happy, but there was not a single upbeat tune on the entire disc. It's all slow, there is no variety in tempo from song to song and it all just blurred into a single slushy trip through the doldrums. I'm a huge fan of Cherry Tree, Alligator, and Boxer so I was extremely excited to get some new material from these guys...High Violet didn't live up to expectations. On all of their other CD's there are at least couple of songs that pick up the pace (Lit Up, Able, Mr. November, Mistaken for Strangers, Squalor Victoria, etc) and give you some relief from what would otherwise be a very slow overall feel to the album. High Violet offers no such relief.     The thing that made me stop trying to love this album was seeing them perform it live. They played a great mix of the new material and the old material and without fail, when one of the new songs came up attention moved away from the stage for a lot of people in the crowd. They went to go get drinks, turned and talked to friends etc. I found myself doing the same.     Ultimately High Violet won't get much playtime by me. However, I have to say that I'm still very eagerly awaiting their next effort.     Oh, and they are AMAZING live! They played Fake Empire first and honestly it was so good that if they walked off stage right then I still would have been happy to see that one song. Go see them if you can.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|I have to agree with most of the reviewers here. Blood of the Nations is an amazing album. When Udo left the first time in the late 1980's and David Reece took over lead vocals on Eat the Heat, they had lost their identity. So I was a little skeptical about their new vocalist Mark Tornillo. I remembered his former band TT Quick but had forgotten what they sounded like. I checked out the video for \\"Teutonic Terror\\" on YouTube and I was hooked. I've listened to this disc at least 50 times since and it still sounds awesome. Tornillo's powerful biting vocals are an excellent fit for the band. They have updated their sound a bit but with those aggressive tempos, Wolf Hoffman's spirited guitar work, and those trademark gang choruses, it is still Accept. \\"Teutonic Terror\\" is an excellent choice as the single: heavy as sin but also quite catchy and an awesome chorus. Most of the songs continue in that vein and all of them (\\"Beat the Bastards\\", \\"Locked and Loaded\\", \\"Bucketful of Hate\\", \\"No Shelter\\", etc) are fantastic. The slower paced songs like \\"Kill the Pain\\" and \\"Shades of Death\\" take a few listens to grow on you but end up sounding great as well. Other strong tracks include the killer \\"Pandemic\\", the anthem \\"New World Comin\\", and another great epic in the title track. While I think Blood of the Nations comes up literally a sliver short of Balls to the Wall and Metal Heart, that's not a slight since those are two of the best 10 or 15 metal albums of the 1980's. If you love metal, buy this or download it ASAP.
0525423273|4.0|It was with great trepidation that I started Anna and the French Kiss. The good buzz for this book is insane! Best book of the year....best book EVER and so on. I almost never feel like everyone else does a book so I was skeered.<br />However, my most trusted blogger friends were the ones promising it would be good, so I had to see what all the fuss was about. I have to admit that it didn't quite meet the best book ever or even best book this year for me - but I did love it.<br />This is mostly because of my love for the protagonist, Anna. She is such a great example of a female YA character. I wish more were written like her. She's funny, smart and fallible but picks herself up and moves on.<br />Anna is sent by her father to a prestigious boarding school, The School of America, for US students in Paris, France. She has to leave behind her best friend and her new blossoming relationship with the cute rocker boy Toph. She is not a happy camper. Most of the students come from rich families while she does not and she can barely speak a word of French.<br />She soon becomes friends with students that have been attending the school which helps with her loneliness. She also meets &Eacute;tienne St. Clair a cute English/American boy who is unavailable due to his long term relationship with his girlfriend, Ellie.<br />The story is mostly centered on this relationship. Anna & St. Clair form a bond and become best friends. She feels more for him and it's obvious he has more than friendly feelings for her but that pesky girlfriend issue keeps getting in the way.<br />There are a lot of \\"almost\\" moments for them and I loved how Anna kept her head about her and didn't let a boy drag her down. She was able to maintain the friendship and move on when she didn't think there was hope for more. She didn't sit at home pining away. She explored the city of Paris, went to movies alone, dated. What a concept!!<br />As for the few things that kept this from being the perfect book in my eyes.....I think the missed opportunities with St. Clair went on a tad too long for me. I found myself wondering a few times what kind of boyfriend he would even be if they finally got together. Etienne St. Clair is a wonderful boy and there is never any doubt that he is over the moon for Anna but I felt like I wasn't getting the whole picture when it came to his character. I just wished I got a few chapters from his POV or maybe a conversation with him and another character. What was he thinking when he would leave her for a few days and then just show back up? What kind of relationship was he having with Ellie while he was in love with Anna? This is a minor complaint and should not dissuade you in anyway. In fact I don't know anyone else who even felt the same as I did about this. *see \\"best book ever* comment at the top.<br />Another thing I loved about Anna and the French Kiss was even though this was a star crossed lover's tale, it never ventured into unbelievable slap stick territory. There were crossed signals and missed opportunities but it was all firmly rooted in reality. In fact I can say that several of these situations occurred in my teenage years. Unfortunately, it took place in the super exciting state of RI rather than Paris. Oh well. This is a very honest depiction of friendships, love and life as a teenager.<br />There really is too much going on in Anna and the French Kiss for me to fit all into one review. There are great supporting characters, beautiful descriptions of Paris and enough talk of delicious food to make you want to hop on the next flight to Paris!<br />As for swoony boys......I liked St. Clair but my attention kept being drawn to Josh, St. Clair's artistic best friend. Perkins is signed on to write two companion novels, Lola and the Boy Next Door ( September 2011) and Isla and Happily Ever After (late 2012) and I'm hoping my boy Josh is the focus of one of those stories. There is a little hint that he just may be in that last one. *fingers crossed*

B003L77TZI|1.0|There I was, sitting in my comfy chair watching TV, half asleep. Then it happened!  All of a sudden, this great banshee-like cry erupted from the TV, a soul burning screech that nearly knocked me out of my seat: \\"AAAAIEE-AIEEEE-AIEEEE, EAST COAST GURLS...\\".    What the heck was that, I wondered. Did someone murder a cat slowly? Did someone get their toenails pulled out? No. It was this thing, this human ghetto blaster, this creature in a push-up bra - Katy Perry. Who would listen to this sound pollution? But then I thought \\"It is just one bad song, maybe she is not just some propped-up hoochie. I should listen to her whole CD.    That was a BIG mistake. One \\"song\\" worse than the last. \\"AAAAIIEEE-AAAAIEE-AAAIIEEE!!!!!\\". Prisoners at Gitmo deserve better. So do you, buy some real music instead of this 3rd grade nonsense.

B002NPUCP8|4.0|Orianthi is somewhat of a confusing offering. She has looks, can sing, can write, and can definately play the guitar. But she does none of that fantasically well on it's own. She's is definately pretty enough to turn heads, but no Cindy Crawford. She can hold a note well, but she's no Mariah Carey. Her writing skills are budding, and she's showing potential, but she's no Tracy Chapman. And while she can definately play the guitar, she's no Steve Vai.    What she is, is most probably the most complete package you'd ever find in a recording artiste today.    Her album \\"Believe\\", is equally odd, considering her influences. For someone who grew up influences by the likes of Carlos Santana and Steve Vai, she churns out a pop album that's quite unlike her first one. Though it's not a bad pop album at that. It's catchy, easy to sing to, and makes you feel young. It's also probably an album concocted to gain market presence as quickly as possible, targeting the most mainstream of listeners. Yet the album sounds disjointed. There's so many styles of music in there, it's as if it was cobbled together hurriedly.    \\"Violet Journey\\", being Orianthi's first album, remains to this day a more mature approach to her music. Her Santana influences are extremely evident on that album, and it is also very well written. It is cohesive, and sounds like she took sometime off to seriously think about the album she wanted to create. With \\"Believe\\" she sounds like she took two steps backwards.    I think this girl is off on the right track headed to more epic releases, but \\"Believe\\" is not one of them. It is an album meant to break into a new market for her, and to gain widespread acknowledgement and radio airplay. If you want a feel-good album just to enjoy and hum along to, then \\"Believe\\" would deliver that for sure.    But if you want to hear Orianthi without the commercial bits, then \\"Violet Journey\\" is IT.     I actually for one cannot wait for her next album to see what she delivers.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Lisbeth Salander is my favorite female character of ALL time. She is perfectly imperfect & Stieg Larsson depicted her in such detail that I truly feel like I know her.  The Millenium series will be on my bookshelf forever, as well as in my kindle!!
B001PB3RU8|3.0|The vocalist has an amazing, atmospheric voice. This album is your soundtrack for running across the moors with your lover in Ireland and wearing a long, flowing dress, you know? I can take 2 or 3 songs at a time \\"Dog Days Are Over\\" \\"Drumming Song,\\" but all together the album and her voice is way too intense and loud. It gets tiring after a while. I bought the whole album, but could have done with maybe 3 or 4 of my favorite songs. Also, the songs tend to sound basically the same. This woman is very talented, but the album is a bit overhyped.
B004FDY4LE|5.0|Zombie movies have bad acting and lots of zombies, they always end leaving you wondering... what happens next.    This show has great acting.  It is about 75% story 25% zombie action per episode. nice balance between the two.
B00406UK7S|4.0|Plain and simple, \\"Gladiator\\", this is not, but it is a good entertaining movie. Just as good as \\"Robin Hood\\" or \\"Troy\\", reminds me of \\"King Arthur\\". Not completely historically accurate, but a great tale of Roman occupied ancient England/Scotland and their bloody battles with the Picts. Definately worth watching.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|I just couldn't put this down!  I was completely drawn into the time, the people and the art scene of the day.  New York will never vibrate in the same way again.
0763644765|5.0|I was looking for a potty training book that didn't use incorrect terms when referring to genitalia, and decided on this one with its androgynous child and no 'peepees,' 'hoohas,' or any other weird words.  The story is adorable!  The book is just the right size, with bold, cute illustrations.  It instantly became one of my son's favorites.  Sadly, it doesn't seem to have increased his interest in the potty.
B003YFIUW8|1.0|I guess there's not much difference in the way a pre-schooler thinks and talks compared with a developmentally-challenged kid.  This book bored me to tears.  My only consolation is that I purchased it for the Kindle which means it cost less than the real book and I don't have this crap taking up space on my bookshelf.    But maybe you'll like it.
B0047A72E6|5.0|Buddy Guy is sounding great on this album. He is like the fine wine of the Blues. As he gets older, the better he sounds, always deep and inspirational for the other guitarist of the blues-rock category.
B00005KAQP|4.0|A quirky comedy about a Reno lounge singer hiding under police protection in a San Francisco convent before she testifies to put away her mobster boyfriend. . .and while she's at the convent she takes over the choir, giving the good nuns an edgy sound that attracts neighborhood derelicts to come to mass. . .and not only has the singer transformed the convent (and its stodgy, ultra-conservative mother superior)--the convent has transformed the feisty singer, culminating in an historical performance--before the pope.<br /><br />Okay:  On its face, if someone gives me the above synopsis and then asks if I would like to see such a flick, they would receive an emphatic \\"No\\".  (After I've stopped laughing, mind you.)  Yet fortunately I did not have any preconceived notions of SISTER ACT when I first rented it years and years ago and brought it home, where my kids just ate it up.  This is a movie everyone can sit down and enjoy together; it has such a warm charm and feel-good buzz you'll swear there's some divinity going on.  Over the years I've watched this movie on several occasions, and it still entertains and charms my curmudgeonly soul.<br /><br />Ask John Q. Public which movie Whoopi Goldberg is best known for, and I'll bet the farm he'll tell you SISTER ACT.  Goldberg is a hoot in the lead role, because here she can be her characteristic over-the-top, and it works.  The supporting cast compliments Goldberg handsomely, from Maggie Smith to Harvey Keitel to a vocally-enhanced Kathy Najimy--but most of all Mary Wickes as a good-natured yet grumpy and crusty Sister Lazarus (she steals, then chews up, every scene she's in).  Yes, SISTER ACT is lame, silly, and requires a suspension of disbelief akin to scaling Pike's Peak, but I dare you to watch this movie and not have a smile paste itself on your mug.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
B0043IMW4W|5.0|This is a great rocking record from Kenny Wayne Shepherd who plays his heart out across those Strats to a very overwhelming audience. The band played great, great sounds!
0312600844|5.0|... not having read enough of the Great Works to comment on Franzen's originality or insightfulness in the context of Irving et al. Nonetheless, the book felt as though it was written almost directly at me, illuminating my own personal dilemmas and under-developed cultural musings.      As someone how has spent his 20s during the decade Franzen chronicles, I found in Freedom far more I could relate to than I found in The Corrections.      This to me was an excellent book -- and for those who give it one (!?) star, I truly wonder on what scale this book is being measured.     Is this a political disagreement, with Republicans doing all the hating?
B001AQO3QA|4.0|This is a great collection. I'm glad I held off and waited for the Bluray collection.    The picture quality and sound are amazing. (You only get 5.1 here though) You must remember these are old films shot with dated technology. The new HD transfers look very good on the first two films. I was not impressed with Alien 3 and Ressurection. Your viewing experience will only be limited by the capabilities of your TV / Bluray player. I'm sure it would be awesome on an LED....    I initially had lot of difficulty loading the discs. I got the latest Samsung update before playing the discs and it still took multiple attempts for each disc to load. Once it does load all the way, it works every time. (for me anyway)    The extra features are endless. Each film has a 3 hour documentary plus tons of additional features.     Worth the price for huge fans! Gets me excited about the prequel!
B000001F7R|4.0|One of the great stories of hard rock/heavy metal is sharing with your friends or someone not in the know, what a popular band sounded like before they were big, maybe a difference or style. Rush's first album for example, 60's Stones, 60's Who, early Faces era Rod Stewart, 70's Priest, early Styx, early REO Speedwagon, all these bands started out pretty different than what most average music fans/radio listeners know from day to day.     Def Leppard is one of those great stories, their debut album came out of the NWOBHM movement where many underground hard rock/metal bands carved out what metal would indeed become in the 80's, the most famous of which, Motorhead, Iron Maiden, Preist, Venom, Saxon, Girlschool, Diamond Head and a 100's of other lesser known groups. Leppard was one of them, just another unknown British band working the pubs. Their debut album released in 1980 is a far cry from what most people are aware of off their Pyromania/Hysteria eras. In the mid/late 80's Lep were a highly commercial, very potent, stadium/radio band. With big hooks, huge choruses, and a powerful but very radio friendly sound. Most wanting to venture out and hear the bands debut will be quite surprised. Rock Brigade, It Could Be You, Wasted, Satellite, all bone crunching rockers, all great songs. Of course you'll hear the usual, \\"their sound wasnt developed yet\\", \\"Joe hadn't found his voice yet\\", \\"the classic line up with Phil wasnt secured\\". So what?  Yes, Pete Willis was the bands lead guitarist and his riffs are quite good and he was very capable at what he did. It was for substance problems that he was actually let go following the bands 2nd album High 'N Dry.    Another interesting note was former Judas Priest producer Tom Allom was manning the boards here, the \\"6th\\" Lep, Mutt Lang hadn't produced the band yet so they lacked that sheen glossy and somewhat poppy sound Hysteria and its watered down follow ups had. But some fans, those who are into the more heavier stuff preferthis Leppard, much like those particular fans enjoy Motley Crue's more dirtier rocking debut Too Fast For Love than their other more polished efforts. Special mention to the NWOBHM classic \\"Rocks Off\\", although this version is great, seek out the original version of the song done on the bands independently recorded \\"Def Leppard EP\\" to hear an even rawer and kick ass version of this nugget. When The Walls Come Tumbling Down is the sort of ballad and you can already hear early shades of what would become Bringin' On The Heartbreak in its opening but soon evolves into another rocker complete with awesome galloping heavy sections. There's not a bad song on here as Overture and It Dont Matter get the job done as round out cuts. The songs are all together and they all rock. Sorrow Is A Woman another great song with slow parts but has some great guitar work in its build up.     So for fans who cant get away from the pop perfection of Hysteria you might wanna steer clear, but for someone who wants to hear some real honest hard rock, a youthful band rocking away, check this lost classic out. Even its follow up High N Dry, which still sounds miles away from Hysteria, has a more basic hard rock sound, sort of pales in comparison to this. Heavy metal fans (not pop/rock), make sure to dig into this great album.
B004132HZS|5.0|At first I was leery about the idea of Sherlock Holmes and his trusty side kick Dr. Watson in the 21st Century. But after seeing the first episode on PBS, I was hooked.The writing and acting was of the highest order. Unlike some other versions of Holmes, I would really recommend it to others. I just hope that a second series is started soon. Especially if the Baker Street Irregulars are incorporated. Well done to all involved!
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|I'm very surprised I don't have any complaints as I couldn't watch the series when it was on tv without falling asleep.  It has the action of the previous 24 seasons but this is coming from a 24 fan that has bought every season when they came out.  When I get a new season I start from the being again.  Worth the buy from Amazon
0553381407|5.0|A must read for those who maybe do not need to see a therapist but still struggle from time to time with the hurtful legacy. It is comforting and maybe empowering to know you are not the only one with outrageous stories of abuse.
1599218011|5.0|So far the best healthy book i ever read. everything is explained so good , when you get to the end of the book, u just cant imagine putting something that has no benefits to your body in your mouth.   It gives so much knowledge its almost like seeing what happens inside of you when you eat.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I am a huge Jane Austen fan!  I was a little unsure about this series until the Amazon reviews convinced me to give it a go.  What a great period drama.  Charles Dickens weaves a masterful tale and BBC sure knows how to put the pieces together.  I really enjoyed it!
B004132HZS|5.0|When the backlogged bobbies of 21st-Century London call out for someone to put crime to rights, they call who they always have: Sherlock Holmes.  This series packs the emotional heft, intellectual challenge, and derring-do that Doyle invested in his original characters, but resets it amid current technological chaos, social upheaval, and sexual politics.  Purists might balk (they always do), but Moffett and Gattis present us worthy addition to Holmes' mythology.<br /><br />The stories upend Doyle's original, sometimes reversing what we expect, sometimes taking Doyle's Victorian conceits into our web age.  Three feature-length episodes take us through changes more intense than a one-hour drama could approach, including the ambiguities inherent in characters like Sherlock, played with chilling incisiveness by Benedict Cumberbatch, and Watson, a character that coaxes unexpected depth from comic actor Martin Freeman.<br /><br />Beyond the mysteries, this makes for good character drama, with extremes of human behavior and trust put on the rack.  This elicits moments of unexpected but grim humor, touched with a certain gloom that doesn't quite lapse into abject pessimism.  Too infrequently do we see as complex and multi-layered a story as we have presented to us here, and since we have only three episodes, we still have it in short supply.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Absolutely love this movie. We bought it for my 5 year old for Christmas and we've all watched it together several times already.  It's an absolute crack-up with an awesome cast.  Highly recommended, and the Blu-Ray is incredible!
B002ZG981E|1.0|This movie is a hot mess, and extremely overrated! These dreams appeared to be more like nightmares! It's apparent that Christopher Nolan solely relied specifically on special effects, and nothing else. The synopsis is minimal, which could have been easily depicted in a 1:45 minutes film, instead of an overly 2 and a half hours. A movie that contains 75 percent of special effects, with no character developments whatsoever, is strictly not good film making. Besides, its time for Leonardo DiCaprio to do a comedy, or a musical for a change. Practically, every movie he has starred in the past were dramas, action/adventure, and thrillers. Leo need to chill out, before he goes insane in real life. He's been portraying too many serious roles throughout his career. According to Leonardo DiCaprio's film repertoire, he's not diversified actor.
0307454541|4.0|Although this book was tough to get into at first (I actually had to draw a diagram to keep all the characters straight!), the payoff was well worth it. I found this book to be a nicely-written murder mystery novel that kept my attention until the end. Looking forward to the next novel in the series.
076115728X|3.0|This chunky little book is a great gift for preschoolers or anyone on your list who may need a gentle reminder that every oops! can be made beautiful with just a bit of imagination.   Artistic opportunities abound when paint drips and paper tears. Spills and smudges become happy surprises on each brightly colored page. The right attitude can turn, \\"I messed up,\\" into, \\"Wow!\\"  Small hands will enjoy exploring the foldouts, pop-ups, holes and rips. Older readers will appreciate the book's simple message: life is full of mistakes - embrace them!
B00004R99F|5.0|HAHAHHAHAHAHAA! Words can't describe the nostalgia I get just looking at this movie on this site<3 Its been years since I've seen this movie and a huge part of my childhood. The last time I saw it I was about 9 or 10 years old before my VHSes stopped working. When I was little this movie was one of my favorite Disney movies ever. One of my fondest memories of this movie was its soundtrack. Its definately one of the most underrated movie soundtracks. I didn't know it then, but Tevin Cambell (an R&B singer) did the music for, the Goofy universes version of Michael jackson, Powerline. OMG! I have Eye To Eye and Stand Out on my MP3 player now. I even have the clips from the songs in my favorites on Youtube! The animation is definately top notch. It takes me back to the time when Disney, Don Bluth (when they were awesome) and other companies made handdrawn cartoon movies instead of just CGI. At least Princess and The Frog is an attempt at bringing back that magic, but whens the next one coming. Theres alot I can say about this movie, but it'll be pages long. Think god for the internet because now I can find this movie again after all these years<3 I'm definately gonna buy off Amazon and if you haven't seen it before, then you should too. This is an underrated classic.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Overall just a great product.  Movie is one of, if not the best movie of 2010.  Comes at a great price.  A must buy for sure.
B000ATQYT2|4.0|This movie is best described as cute. There's the sometimes silly, sometimes dry humor of the muppets, creative songs, and the acting done by Michael Cane is good. I would have to say that there is a small level of hollowness to his acting, but considering he is acting alongside Mrs. Piggy and Kermit, I think he does a fantastic job. This is a good christmas carol for young children, some moments might be eerie for them, I don't consider them frightening.<br /><br />I bought this as a christmas gift for my wife, she loves it mostly for the nostalgia, I think.
B003UYUP58|3.0|This is a compelling story told in a very readable, fast-paced style. The Kindle version, however, contains lots of annoying dark underlines, which are links to the endnotes. (Note: These are NOT the popular highlights which can be turned off in \\"Settings.\\") These underlines are enormously distracting - there are as many as 6 or 7 on some pages - and make the book very hard to read. I may not finish it in the Kindle version and buy the old-fashioned format instead.
B004G8ZZHU|5.0|I tell you what, there have only been a few movies made about a show which was actually substantially better than the show, this is one.    I was very skeptical about this movie, because I didn't much like the original show, but the reviews here sucked me in.  I'm glad of it, this is an excellent movie.  Just plan fun.  Has the silliness of the show with some twists that make it better.    I whole heartily commend the writers, directors and producers of this film for taking something that was mediocre and making it great.  It's just a blow'em up, laugh it up, get serious about the bad guys , fun movie.  To bad there isn't an Academy Award for the most fun film of the year.
B0042816YK|3.0|Had I read the book.  Found it to be pretentious, way too long, thin on a real plot, and boring.  Should have been edited down to the Thanksgiving scene in Italy, the wedding scene in India (and the elephant scene), and everything in Bali.    Too wordy and chick flicky.  I love Ms. Roberts, but this was just not an interesting enough film to spend nearly 3 hours on.
B000683VI4|5.0|Greetings....    This is an awesome movie. A truly marvelous love story.     When ones love disappears a bit every day,  the heart tears bit by bit with this journey  into living oblivion. There is no resolution. For  memory fades like the sun going down in the west.    Watch the movie and you will get some idea of the  effect on the one cognizant of a life disappearing  and the effect on the one remaining.    Recommend the movie highly.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Some may not like that the overweight characters are not so nice in this movie (the mean Orphan Director, the evil Bank Director), but this was a great film.  Laughed out loud several times.  Maybe a little to grown up for very young children, but should be okay for the older ones.    Steve Carell's voice was unrecognizable as the main Villain as was Julie Andrews' voice as his slightly abusive, but hilarious Mother.
B0043RSE2M|5.0|Great movie.  It reminds my wife and I so much of our own girls.  And the best part?  You don't have to go buy a 3D tv to get the 3D version of this movie.  It was good to finally see a decent movie released on Blu-ray 3D and not bundled exclusively with a 3D TV.  If the manufacturers really want 3D to take off, they need to recognize that content is the limiting factor right now and stop with the exclusive package deals.      Oops, guess I got off track.  This is a fun movie whether you watch it in 3D or not.
B0002V7OI8|4.0|I love this movie.  My favorite disaster film.  It's more cerebral than Armageddon.  (although I have that movie also)  Just make sure that you don't purchase from BIGTPC.  They were extremely slow in delivering.
142311339X|5.0|All the characterization, snappy dialogue, and entertaining interior dialogue that made the Percy Jackson series fly makes [[ASIN:142311339X The Heroes of Olympus, Book One: The Lost Hero]] come to life, too.  Rick Riordan has written another terrific series that will have you hopping from one foot to another as you wait for the next book to come out. Highly recommended.
B003EYVXSW|3.0|\\"Splice\\" for the majority of the film's running time is an intelligent riveting sci-fi thriller.  Then the preposterous ending lands like a giant thud and undoes what good will the film engendered for 95 percent of it's running time.  Not to give away the farm the scriptwriters were probably going for a \\"Demon Seed\\" ending instead it's more reminiscent of \\"Humanoids From the Deep\\".  That would be okay except the latter film was deliberately campy.  I'm not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater and give the film a one star review.  Those unsuspecting be forewarned that the film's ending negates what could have been a really great film.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|I'm very happy with this fifth season, new doctor and new writers.  The actors are much better, the doctors companion Amy is a very good match.  Gone is the gay/lesbian propaganda in every episode.  Finally this is an entire season that I can feel comfortable showing my kids, as Dr. Who is supposed to be targeted at a family audience.
B003P2WJ6S|5.0|Read it cover to cover ( as much as you can do this on a Kindle ) without a break    I was expecting this book to be maybe a little dry, but instead it celebrates people as much as it condemns the tragedy of the end of Herietta Lacks' life, and the failure of the clinical field to recognise her and her family's contribution    It's a warm and loving book. Hopefully one day it will be a compulsory text for all students of science and medicine so that they can learn that scientific results are connected a broader social context on so many levels    Totally worth it
B003NFM3JU|5.0|A great adaptation of the classic story.  The animation is fantastic.  I like it as it is a bit more dark than other versions have been.  It is a must add to any holiday library.
B001SRC9P8|1.0|Ok - let me first preface this by saying that I am writing this as a mother...not a reader. I read this book recently after my 12 year old bought it. She loved it. While I appreciate the mystery, I think the book glorifies dangerous behaviors including drinking, shoplifting, bulimia, sex...  The girls who behave in these ways become the \\"popular girls.\\"  Sure, they are not necessarily happy... But from my reading the book does not really emphasize the negative results of their behaviors at all! If you are a parent of a child who wants to read this I would suggest that you read it too and be ready to talk with your kids about it!

B000AGTPUK|3.0|The quality of the product was great, and I thought the movie was well done.  But honestly, I think the story is a bit empty, kinda making Christmas all about believing in Santa... that's not really the true meaning of Christmas in my mind, but more of a fun element to it.  Anyway, I love the whole train idea, but I just thought the true meaning of the story was lacking, not something I'd want to teach my kids to be the true meaning of Christmas, and the movie was actually a bit boring/slow moving in my mind... especially for kids.  Basically, I don't think I'll be watching this every year :)

B002LYTNR4|5.0|All I can say is I am listening to it again for the third time. I cannot<br />express what you can learn from this cd set. It is a cure for that<br />nagging voice in your head that tells you what to be afraid of, insecure<br />about, judgmental of and all the other negatives you don't even realize you<br />are hearing in your minds ear. Even if you are a Christian, Jew, or Muslim<br />this is a way of being, you can believe whatever else you want and still get<br />the maximum benefit from Eckhart Tolle. This has improved my stress level and<br />relationships and my understanding of the way we think and act. Try it !!!!<br />You will only be better for it.
B00005OCMR|5.0|I don't really expect a lot when purchasing used DVDs, but this product was exactly as advertised - mint condition, and obviously well taken care of by the original owner (who also was the seller).    Communication after the purchase was timely, and the product shipped the same day as purchase, arriving by USPS express mail two days later.    Overall, an excellent experience from an outstanding seller.  AAA+
B0032UYFA6|5.0|AMC is putting out some of the best shows in the history of television. This is one of them. At first I thought it might be edging toward an over-reliance on gore, but then the more human stuff came in and it got real interesting. I could see Quentin Tarantino and Dostoevsky collaborating on something like this. If that's what you like, you won't be disappointed.
B0036WSW8G|4.0|For those who are eager to purchase this film on blu-ray, it's now available at a more or less normal price in the US domestically under the title \\"Nanny McPhee Returns\\". Same movie, different package and different title, and a lot less money! Enjoy.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I read this in less than 10 hours, on Christmas (so it isn't as though I didn't have other things going on).  I couldn't sit it down.  The first chapter or so, I was wondering if I'd be able to get \\"into\\" it because the style of writing (through the eyes of Jack) takes a bit of getting used to.  Before I could make the decision, I already was unable to walk away from the book.  A friend recommended this book to me, and I'm so glad she did because I tell everyone about how amazing it is now.
B001UV4XFG|2.0|Kristen Stewart and Rob Pattinson have a commentary on the dvd that I was really looking forward to since they didn't do one for the New Moon dvd.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but it was a very disappointing.      At the very beginning of the commentary, Rob says something like: \\"I'm in LA and Kristen is in Montreal, so this is probably going to be very awkward and annoying and we'll have nothing to say after 3 minutes.\\"  He was right!  Scenes were passing by and there was no commentary, only Silence.  The pauses were so long, I thought the commentary on my dvd player had shut itself off.      Also, I had to watch the commentary with subtitles because I couldn't understand what they were talking about, and then even with the subtitles, I couldn't understand Kristen half the time.  She said things like (and this is word for word): \\"I don't know.  I mean, maybe it's just like, I mean, maybe it fits with the, you know, us us humans are really fragile and like the main character is a girl and all of that and the fact that she's willing to subject herself to something like so sexually overpowering is like something that's actually it's not just it's not just like, it's not just like cool and scary, it's actually sort of like not not the smartest thing.  Maybe that's, you know what I mean, maybe they're reminding you that this girl or whoever like these like they're actually really sensitive so yeah I don't know, whatever.\\"    Or \\"She was yeah she was getting like really yeah every time she was getting close I mean I'm kidding she totally could have done whatever, but.\\"    Really great scenes were passing by and there's no commentary!  Just silence.  For example, in the scene where Bella leans against Jacob in wolf form, that would have been a great opportunity to talk about how they did that.  All's Kristen says is something like, \\"his little suit.\\"  What?  What's that mean?  Was that an actual wolf suit?  When I saw the behind the scenes takes, I realized thatTaylor Lautner was actually dressed in this gray scuba-like suit for that scene.  He leans down and she pats his head just like he does in wolf form.  That would have been something interesting to talk about, but no.    Also, Kristen tells Rob to \\"shut up\\" or \\"shhh\\" about 30 times which was kind of annoying.    Half way through, Rob says, \\"People are going to watch this and be like, really, that's all you have to say?\\"  At least he was aware of it!    One high point is Rob's sense of humor.  I was laughing out loud during some parts of his commentary.  And seeing his real personality and accent, it made me appreciate him as an actor since he is really nothing like Edward.    Aside from the commentary, I know this movie could make me cry if there was another actress playing the role of Bella.  Kristen Stewart is a good actress, in other movies.  For some reason, I can't relate to her.  My heart won't soften when she's on the screen.  With Edward and Jacob, my heart starts to break, and then she shows up and it stops.  There's no chemistry with her.  She's not vulnerable enough or something.  And she never smiles.  She's got the right look but that's all.  It's kind of a shame, imho.    Stephenie Meyer and one of the producers also do a commentary, and that one is excellent.  No long awkward pauses.  They're focused and give you lots of behind the scenes info.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|...even with all the color timing issues, and the horrendous changes to the Vader/Palps/Luke finale, and Obi Wan's drunk homeless man yell...    this thing is STILL #1 in pre-orders on Amazon. I'm willing to bet every single one of you who one-starred this monstrosity, this mockery of what's supposed to be Star Wars, will end up buying it at some point in the future. You just can't help yourselves. Lucas does what he wants because he KNOWS after 34 years, he has you all by the balls. Star Wars culture is so ingrained in your minds that no matter what he does, you will still fork over your cash eventually. Eventually he will add in a scene where Palpatine looks directly into the screen, breaks the fourth wall, and says, \\"You, like the millions of others, are now...LUCAS'.\\"     And you al will whine. And moan. And complain. And go on a one-star rampage.    then you'll pay cold hard cash for another hit of Star Wars. Just one more hit. It's all you need. Buncha junkies. It's sad.
B002ZG98UA|4.0|While there were some disappointments (the army of Alices played only a minor role, and many things called for suspension of disbelief), overall, (speaking as a resident evil fan), this was a superb movie. In all honestly, speaking objectively, I would call it just another action flick. However my attachment to the characters, mixed with my love of well done action films (and this was well done- plenty of original and epic camera shots and slow motion) causes me to label it an excellent movie. Filled with more than enough gore and action, Mila Jovovich is, as always, a spectacular Alice, paired well with Ali Larter and Wentworth Miller. I enjoyed the larger role Claire played in this film, complimenting Alice's 'fighter-girl' persona with her own. While this film did not leave as much room for character development as I would have liked, it gave enough for me to become attached to the new characters, and more so to the old.  My favorite part about this movie however, is that I believe it is the first horror-centered film in which (spoiler) the black guy makes it to the end. Filled with epic battle scenes, suspense, and even a few emotional (if cliche) moments, I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, and I believe anyone else who has enjoyed the past resident evil movies will as well.
B004856SQ8|4.0|An 8 MGB Memory Card will be needed to play this DVD on most Blu-ray players.  While the cost of this card can be more than the purchase price of the DVD, the card can be used repeatedly with other Blu-ray DVDs requiring additional memory.  The Blu-ray is excellent and surpasses the original theater version.
B0036S4CTS|2.0|The premise of this book sounds really promising: seeing a life-long relationship develop year by year. Unfortunately, I was expecting it to be very romantic and to deal with serious issues many years into a marriage. Instead, it chronicles a very unhealthy relationship between a party-centric jerk, whose character really doesn't develop, and his friend, who has a long and inexplicable crush on him, but who at least has some depth. I didn't get any higher message or insight into the human psyche or relationships from this book. I was not satisfied at all by finishing it. SPOILER ALERT! They get together near the end of the book in their late 30s, but there is still very little in the way of romance or a higher meaning. She is unable to conceive and then she dies. That was really disappointing - her life was super depressing (was that the message - that life is unfair?). The book doesn't end here, though I wished it did because the male character was intolerable, and he sinks into a depression too. He regains some small amount of control on his life and then \\"the end\\". Not worth $5.
B0007MWZEK|3.0|Amazon cusotmer service is great, but Swivel Sweeeper Company service is the pits!  I have owned my Swivel Sweeper for about a year and use it almost daily.  The pickup is great, even picks up tons of pet hair and small crumbs.  Works great on low pile carpet, tile and hardwoods.  I don't think it picks up heavy stuff like coins.  You do have to clean the brushes often with the little tool provided, especially if you get a lot of long hair on your floors, but it's not a big deal.  I have not been dissappointed with the battery as some others have mentioned.  Of course it would be nice if the charge lasts longer, but I do think the 45 minutes of cleaning time is about accurate.  I only use it for 5-10 minutes at a time, so I don't have to constantly charge it.  After about 6+ months of good use, the tip of the rubber handle broke which does not affect performance or use.  But at that sametime the sliders started to fall off, which makes it useless because without the sliders it will scratch your floors and won't slide around smoothly.  I went to the website, found my exact model and ordered the replacement sliders.  It took weeks to get them, and turned out they sent the wrong ones, they didn't fit/were a totally different shape.  I called customer service and ended up on the phone with them for 37 minutes, speaking to 3 different people about the problem.  They all insisted they have to be the correct ones, even though the shape and size did not match up at all.  They were not helpful at all and seemed almost ignorant and bordering on rude.  In the end, they agreed to send me a different set, but they doubt it will be the correct ones, and it will take 4-8 weeks!  A few days later I noticed my Mom had a Swivel Sweeper at her house, but it was an older/discontinued model she bought from a discount store for cheap and her sweeper had the same sliders the company sent me as replacements.  Needless to say, I'm annoyed.  I can't be without my sweeper for another 4-8 weeks, so I'll have to go buy a brand new one.  Wish I did that from the beginning.  I thought about buying the Shark, but I really like the sliding feature, which I don't think any other sweeper has.  So this is a uinque product that I am willing to buy again, even though their

B00003CXAT|4.0|Spielberg's Jurassic Park still stands on it's own as being a great film, nearly 20 years later after the film was first released.  While there has been tons and tons of movies that have used CGI and CGI has been commonplace everywhere, Spielberg's film still has the emotional power to stir and move like a legendary filmmaker should.  Jurassic Park will be the work of an aueter that keeps it from growing old, while so many films like it are now forgotten within a few years.  We all know that Spielberg's Jurassic Park is terrific entertainment, with thrills and chills on every corner.  But it also manages to be quite a powerful cautionary tale, doing something that films like Frankenstein still haven't been quite able to master.  Now how exactly can a film that made close to a billion and was a franchise starter and marketing powerhouse do that?<br /><br />This is why.  Michael Crichton book has more detail, science, and more ideological intelligence, but Spielberg's film has what Crichton's novel doesn't have: emotional intelligence to make his own viewpoints through behavior come across in a much more convincing way.  Behavior is real but an idea is not necessarily real.  Obviously, this is not an absolute, and the former can justify the reality of the latter, but this makes for a much more convincing and real argument.  Some people call this shallowness, but in my opinion, being able to paint the experience and emotional content of a complex emotional experience is not shallow, and Jurassic Park's scenes of consequence and danger are able do so, with kaleidoscopic emotion and<br /><br />The initial T-Rex scene, one of the most famous of them all, is a good example of this.  Spielberg directs the scene with danger, and the Dinosaur is absolutely primal, stripped down to it's instincts at dangerous cost.  This is a prime display of why Spielberg's Jurassic Park EXTREMELY succeeds in showing WHY tinkering with genetics can be so damn dangerous.  Spielberg also never sugar coats these animals abilities, reminding us of just how primal and vicious they can be.  These creatures can tear up a goat in half a second, they can find their way through environments looking for something to eat, stalk their pray and having no sense of right or wrong that humans do (like animals), and how these creatures are, all in all, extremely, extremely, EXTREMELY dangerous.  It's one reason why this is a valuable and piece of science-fiction, and why it's very much essential as much as other great films.<br /><br />Understandably, this is still a large budget thriller, with more thrills and chills than a roller coaster, but it's damn good one at that, made with talent and passion by Spielberg and company.  There are some underwhelming moments here and there, but some of these are overpowered by Spielberg's awesome visuals, spectacular sound design, and humanistic acting.  The CGI here, despite being somewhat stiff at times, recreates these Dinosaurs as you would expect, and there's a HUGE sense of AWE and BEING, LIFE, even nearly 20 years later.  But it's the sound of these creatures that works.  The ground shaking when a dinosaur lowers it's foot, the huge roars, and the primal ferocity of these animals that will send chills down your spine.  The bone chilling roar of the T-Rex makes you want to trample a city (seems fitting that Mastodon sampled it). I also think the production design is great as well, for what that's worth.  John Williams score is also amazing and uplifting.<br /><br />The character development is a little thin, but I think this is easily transcend with good performances.  Spielberg has a knack for being able to make his characters seem very real (no matter what other people try to convince me.  Nice try but you can't convince me), which really separates his ability from lesser hacks.  There's not a feeling of \\"cardboard\\" character, as they feel very much like what you would expect if you saw one of these people in life.  Even ifyou didn't have, Regarding the I give some props to Spielberg to not having a cloying \\"I'm ready for children I love THEM!\\" moment, but instead some subtly that shows Alan Grant's very realistic alleviation to his dislike of all children after finally opening his mind (or forced to, for a better word).  It's not too deep because characters are second, but it's got enough pathos to move you.<br /><br />I do think that Crichton's book is much more technical and layered, considering that he's a scientist and didn't have to work with David Koepp.  And I do think that the book obviously has value and does thing that Spielberg's film can't do (and vice-versa).  But the movie, for me, is better because it's just more convincing, and simply showing the is much more riveting and makes you think about the consequences of tinkering much more, simply because Spielberg.  On top of that, it has enough heart stopping moments to give, so that certainly doesn't hurt either.  I suggest reading the book to get more of the ideas and applying to the behavior on screen.<br /><br />It's too bad that Jurassic Park is considered to some to be a big soulless, dumb blockbuster film, because there's a lot here to chew on along with awesome special effects, entertaining performances, and white knuckle terror (this definitely isn't a film for young children).  Skip the sequel, as it's merely a cheap facsimile of this film, a big (and boring) budget monster movie with a 100 million dollar budget (the book isn't bad, although it was written more hastily because Spielberg pressured Crichton to write another book).  Whatever you do though, see this one for it's relevance and artistic intentions within one of the most well known pieces of entertainment.I give some props to Spielberg to not having a cloying \\"I'm ready for children I love THEM!\\" moment, but instead some subtly that shows Alan Grant's very realistic alleviation to his dislike of all children after finally opening his mind (or forced to, for a better word).

B0013ND30M|4.0|The video had been opened previously apparently.  There was a note inside of the movie that indicated that the previous owner returned it because her daughter was scared of the queen in the movie.  I do not think what I purchased was a \\"previously owned movie\\" so I was somewhat disappointed that it was advertised that it was brand new.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I admit, I had some concerns with the changes made in the set upon first hearing of them, but that does not hinder me from purchasing my favorite Saga. The changes are minor when put next to the rest of the epic.<br /><br />The blu ray release shows all the movies in stellar 1080p, with amazing 6.1 sound. The films look great, and we all know the story of Star Wars.<br /><br />The biggest factor to get this edition is the 3 bonus disks that show the behind the scenes footage, interviews, concept art, and deleted scenes from all 6 movies. Then the documentaries and spoofs disk has a great deal information for fans of the series.<br /><br />Don't let the negative reviews sway you. You know if you're a fan of the series you'll enjoy the set. Everyone wants to hate on this set because of the changes. If you pass on this, you are only denying yourself the technical quality that Star Wars represents on Blu Ray. Also, most of the bad reviews are from even before the release, knee jerk reactions of changes not seen in context. Judge for yourself. But for me, this is worth it, and a great addition to my collection.
B001FB55L2|4.0|Brothers is a heartbreaking drama about a young, traumatized solider returning from war. Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal give outstanding performances, the weak one in the bunch is Natalie Portman - she hardly shows any emotion in this film. Brothers is difficult to watch but definitely worth a viewing. Give it a try.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|I dont know much about all of the techinical difficulties in \\"remastering' an old record, but I do know that this album sounds good to me. If you want a Beatles album to enjoy without the \\"white noise\\" this one works just fine!
B004498KPU|5.0|I have alot of Michael Jackson dvd's lol. Michael Jackson \\"Vision\\" is an amazing collection of videos to have/own! The only thing I'm not to fond of is how the videos don't fit the entire screen lol. I was aittle bummed to find that out lol :( Other than that, very happy that I have this dvd to add to the collection! I recieved Michael's \\"Vision\\" as a gift for Christmas, so Xmas turned into a Michael Marathon for me lol. I wish the dvd had like behind the scenes of his videos and interviews with him. I've been waiting along time for more concert dvd's to be released from Michael's past tours, idk if that's ever going to happen tho :( Michael is the only person I think I'll ever give \\"5 Stars\\" for everything that he does lol. I'm that much of a huge fan lol. Michael has set the bar soo high for enterainers like me and that's why I love him soo much. He has been such a huge inspiration in my life since the age of 5 and he will continue to be an inspiration for me for the rest of my life! He's not the \\"King of Pop\\" to me, he's the King of Music, Performing, Dancing, Entertaining to me! I hope everyone else enjoyed this dvd collection as much as I did and I hope you enjoyed my review! Let me know what you think!?
B003YNFYCO|5.0|I was a little young when the Beatles were together so I don't know much about the group, but I have always liked their music, and that goes for this album, 26 songs that I enjoy listening to and the sound quality, to me, is so much better than a record.
B00192IV9U|5.0|I don't even know were to begin lol. I'm 26 years old, and I've been a huge fan of Michael since I was 5 years old. He's one of the biggest reasons why I'm an entertainer! So many rumors about this album. The biggest one being, people saying that it's not Michael singing the songs. What alot of people don't understand is, Michael has been making songs since he was like 5 years old. His whole life is singing/performing. You honestly think Off the Wall, Thriller, Bad, Dangerous, Past, Present, and Future, Invincible, and Michael are the only ablums/songs he's ever written lol!? I'll admit there are some songs that are alittle questionable, but he's not 20, 25, 30, 35 anymore lol. His voice has changed with age and his style has changed too. Idk if it's just b/c I'm such a huge fan of Michael or what, but I'm in love with this album! I've been listening to it everyday since it came out. The only song I'm not to fond of would be \\"Hold My Hand\\" feat. Akon. I feel like Akon kinda took that song and made it his song. I think Akon sings more than Michael does in that song lol. In the beginning of the song Akon says \\"Akon and MJ\\" lol. It's like, \\"get over urself\\" lol. It should of be \\"MJ and Akon\\". Anyways, back to my review. I gave this album 5 stars b/c I truely feel \\"Michael\\" is an amazing album! I really hope Sony releases more of Michael's material, b/c I've been waiting soo long to hear new stuff from Michael and although 10 new songs are awesome, I need more lol. I heard Michael said that he had alot of songs that he did not want to be released until after he died. I really hope Michael brought as much joy to everyone else with this album as he did for me! Thanks for reading my review, let me know what you think!!
B000URDE2Y|5.0|I only deleted Bridge of Sighs because I decided to get Tears for Fears. Bridge is a great album, and I may get it in the future. However, Tears has been one of my favorite groups for quite some time. When I discovered their Greatest Hit, I couldn't resist. I played the Samples, and it blew me away. Everything I've ever loved about their singles, and plenty of tunes I'd never heard before. Enthralling!!!
B003YUC2FE|1.0|If you buy all three Toy Story Bluray/DVDs, it's $65.47. You don't get digital copies of Toy Story 1 and 2, but you get cases for all three movies if you buy individually. The box set does not have any additional content so you're paying $15 for packaging and 2 digital copies...and no disc cases.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I had bought SB's second cd first because I wanted some Christmas music at the time.  After hearing her voice, I looked up her YouTube audition and was amazed at her story.  I ordered her first cd thinking it would maybe have a couple of songs I would like.  I played it and could not get beyond the first two, then the first three, lovely songs.  Those three are worth the price of the cd.  Her voice is so lovely, it can move you to tears.  Beware, though, don't plan to read a book or watch tv while this is on.  Sit down and listen to it, that's the only way to really appreciate it. Yes, there are a couple of throwaway songs on there, but all in all, most of the songs are simply gorgeous.  Susan Boyle is a treasure and a discovery straight from heaven.  And the production by Sony and the crew backs her up beautifully.  Wild Horses is a masterpiece.
1599218011|5.0|Kris and I have travelled a very similar so-called journey the last 9 years;  in the van with Mom and Dad going from doctor to doctor getting similar feedback .  So I decided it was time to take matters in my own hands just like Kris.    I am in awe of her tenacity and authenticity so evident in her books, movie, live speeches, telephone sessions, website and Facebook site.  When I get anxious or sad, I visit Kris' blogs, comments and Vlogs for a pick-me-up.    It took Kris' good example to finally get me to start each day with a healthy green juice after a lifetime of hearing \\"eat you greens!\\"  I was excited to find Kris' new book in my mail box after Christmas.  I am only on chapter 2 , but Kris is as awesome as ever!  Kris has been there, done that and got the T-shirt; she understands and speaks our language.  My 2010 \\"Intention\\" is to implement even more of her insights.    Kris, you are my unicorn mascot of hope and living each day to the fullest. Thanks for making this MaritimerGal feel less alone. I hope to meet you someday at one of your retreats.   PS: Although I consume most of my reading using technology, I must have Kris' books in hard copy. They are creative works of art!  Peace, health and green juice!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|The Muppet Christmas Carol is one of the best interpretations of this classic currently on the market.  It is sure to please every age group.  It is vital that each new version of Christmas Carol remains true to Charles Dickens classic and this one will not disappoint.  The storyline is firmly intact.  The best part about this version is the humor and character that the Muppets add to the story.  Michael Caine also does a fantastic job as Ebenezer Scrooge and after watching you will realize you can't imagine anyone else playing the part.    Don't be fooled - this is not for kids only!! Our family started watching this movie years ago and the kids have grown into teenagers and still won't part with our annual viewing!  At first it was especially appealing because some of the scarier and darker parts were so much easier for them to watch when a Muppet character was involved.  But now that they are teenagers, the appeal has made a switch to the humor and wit that is so abundant in the movie.  The movie is not all wit and humor though; the story and emotion of this classic shine through as well.  It's defiantly one to own and watch year after year.

B0032JTV6U|5.0|I was really surprised by how good this show is! I did not expect to like it at all...a show about a high school glee club covering classic songs that many of us grew up adoring...no way, no day! The thing is, the actor-musicians that make up the cast do a tremendous job of putting their own spin to these classics! They are definitely a talented bunch. But what really caught my attention was that there is real heart that underscores the music. There is some seriously solid acting on this show.     Broadway ingenue Lea Michele scored a Lead Actress Emmy nomination and is fabulous as lead glee singer Rachel Berry, but I actually think she is surpassed in acting ability by her male counterpart Cory Monteith, who essays a sublimely confident performance as working class jock Finn Hudson, the quarterback who has a hidden singing talent tapped by glee instructor Will Schuester (excellently performed by professional singer-dancer Matt Morrison, who received a Lead Actor Emmy nom himself); Monteith should have gotten one also; he and Michele have wonderful chemistry as total opposites Finn and Rachel who bond through their love for music; you can feel the chemistry when performing their numbers.    The standouts of the supporting cast are Emmy winner Jane Lynch, who has already created an all-time iconic character in cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester, a world-weary, world-class braggart of a woman with oodles of machismo and bravado and Emmy nominee Chris Colfer as glee clubber Kurt Hummel, an openly gay student who dares not be limited by the constraints imposed by a world that still sadly supports stereotyping to some degree.     Rounding out the well-chosen glee cast are powerful singer Amber Riley (proud Mercedes), soulful singer Kevin McHale (who plays paraplegic Artie), talented singer-dancer Jenna Ushkowitz (as stuttering Tina), classical singer Mark Salling (hearthrob football player Puck),  sweet singer Dianna Agron (head cheerleader Quinn), smooth singer-dancer Naya-Ramirez (sassy cheerleader Santana), and superior dancers Heather Morris (as daffy cheerleader Brittany), Harry Shum Jr. and Dijon Talton (football players Mike and Matt).     Rounding out the adult cast are Emmy nominee Mike O'Malley as Burt Hummel (Kurt's dad), comical Iqbal Theba as Principal Figgins, refreshing Jayma Mays as high school counselor Emma Pillsbury (who has a crush on Will), and hilarious Jessalyn Gilsig as Will's misguided, well-meaning wife.    Major strengths of GLEE include quick-witted, snappy dialogue that the cast delivers with great confidence, jittery camera movement that keeps each episode moving and the viewer a real sense of being there with the cast, and great music choices interspersed with and helping to drive the plot. The pilot is very solid and gets things off to a great start with the original 6 clubbers Rachel, Finn, Mercedes, Kurt, Artie, and Tina performing the club's first routine, a cover of Journey's inspirational \\"Don't Stop Believing\\" (one of my fave songs from the 80s). In later eps, the club expands to 12 members.     Standout eps of Season 1 include:    2-SHOWMANCE (with the original 6 performing an absolutely hilarious rendition of the risque tune \\"Push It\\" in front of the entire student body)    7-THROWDOWN (a classic ep with Will and Sue clashing and the 12-member club finally bonding at the end)    10-BALLAD (funny ep with Rachel crushing on Will)    12-MATTRESS (with the club covering Van Halen's \\"Jump\\" in a very entertaining way)    13-SECTIONALS (with the club competing against rival clubs for the first time)    15-THE POWER OF MADONNA (all Madonna covers, including a wonderful mock video with Sue, Mercedes, and Kurt of Madonna's \\"Vogue\\")    17-BAD REPUTATION (probably my favorite of the season with a hilarious scene in the library of MC Hammer's \\"U Can't Touch This\\", a Sue cover of \\"Physical\\" video, with a cameo by Olivia Newton-John, Rachel's funny \\"Run Joey Run\\" video, and a heart-rending cover of \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\" ending it)    20-THEATRICALITY (a Lady Gaga music ep that includes a powerful scene between Finn, Kurt, and Burt about Kurt's awkward crush on Finn)    22-JOURNEY (the solid season finale)    Special mention should also go to the incredible bickering chemistry between Will and Sue (or Schue and Sue if you prefer!). Morrison and Lynch have impeccable timing in their interactions, which makes GLEE all the more wonderful to enjoy!
B0037KMHRY|1.0|first off - let me tell u that i love daft punk - i've been listening to them since 97 -<br /><br />now this album is absolutely BORING!  Seriously - why are you guys drinking the koolaid?  Better were you rolling when you gave this album 4 stars?<br /><br />dont waste your money - it does nothing for a true fan of daft punk or music in general.  I don't care how much E you take - it won't help.<br /><br />if u want to fall asleep or better yet be tortured get this album!  the bonus album has one okay track - father and son<br /><br />fun movie though<br /><br />4 stars?!  amazon u must be joking<br /><br />UPDATE :<br /><br />Album is still boring and GUARANTEED YOU WILL NOT BE LISTENING TO IT IN A WEEK.<br />0 of 21 found this review helpful.  Wow - the haters come out.<br /><br />If you want a real score - go listen to There Will Be Blood by jonny Greenwood.<br /><br />It's actually compelling, sad, lonely, climatic, and touching.<br />[[ASIN:B000XA50MK There Will Be Blood]]
B00127RAJY|4.0|I've only been doing this for four days, but I can already feel it. It doesn't take much time or commitment, but it will make you burn in certain trouble areas. I'm normal BMI, in my 20s, and I feel that this is well worth my time. I have a gym membership but have found that this is something i can do when I don't have time for the gym. It's really hard to make excuses when only 20 minutes are at stake, and my schedule right now is such that I can't carve out two hours to get ready, drive over there, exercise, drive back and shower every night. This is a great alternative, but not necessarily a permanent substitute.    One thing that troubles me is that people think they're supposed to do this 30 times in 30 days. I question how healthy and safe that is for most people, especially if you're doing each level 10 times in a row. You need to listen to your body. If you feel like some muscle groups just aren't up to doing the exact same exercises for the 6th or 7th day in a row, DON'T. Do something else instead. Go for a walk. Ride a bike. Do a different video that features different exercises.    I've been having problems with tightness in my calves though I'm in decent shape. I might try going to level two to see if switching it up helps.    I think one, two or three pound hand weights are fine. Increase the weight as you feel you need more of a challenge.    Two big pet peeves about this video for me:  1 - You can't skip over the stupid introduction. I don't need three minutes of Jillian explaining the concept of the program to me when I heard the same thing yesterday and the day before. It's not even that informative.  2 - Not enough stretching afterward. I get that this is supposed to be quick, but there should be some kind of disclaimer that people should stretch on their own if possible. I do, but this will make you so sore if you're a beginner and don't stretch.    Summary: Worth the money and the time the exercises take.    I will update this when I'm done withthe 30 days so I can say whether I've lost any weight and inches!
B001U6YI92|2.0|Unfortunately the best western ever is not the best blu-ray ever. The blu-ray version is the extended cut which is a huge downgrade from the original theatrical cut. The 17 or so minutes that are added to the 161 minute theatrical cut really ruin the pacing of the film. There is a reason they didn't make the theatrical cut. The blu-ray ONLY CONTAINS THE EXTENDED CUT while the dvd that comes with it has the theatrical cut. Why they couldn't have both on the blu-ray I don't understand but it is really to bad.<br /><br />I give the Theatrical cut 5 stars, the extended 4 stars, and the blu-ray 2 for being so stupid and not including both.
B004EJ14V2|4.0|This movie was funny and engaging, I personally like high school movies, maybe because they're so surreal. It is though, as all/most Hollywood happy ending movies, just a story, don't try to see anything else than it is in it (i.e some deep message within it- ok, other than try to be yourself and not lie to everyone about how you are or you'll suffer the consequences). But since we don't live in an ideal world, one has to keep in mind that all this movie is about it's just one pretty fantasy. First example: fellow classmates may not care about what you rant on your webcam and keep treating you as trash. If you're a kid or teenager and run away from home, you'll probably end up pretty bad (whether you're gay or not). ETC, you can see where I'm going, and I think I made my point. Watch, enjoy, relax, don't take it too seriously.

I would like to give this concert 5 stars but the quality for this Blu Ray was not the best, anyway I think u2 fans MUST buy this concert!!!!
B003EYVXXW|4.0|\\"Agora\\" has much to recommend it. The recreations of ancient Alexandria, with the camera sweeping past the great lighthouse, are quite magnificent, and the costumes, the details of which have been based upon the Roman-Egyptian Fayum portraits, are equally spectacular. Rachel Weisz portrays a believable Hypatia, the unique philosopher-scientist, who was associated with Alexandria's center of learning, the Great Library, the Temple of Sarapis and its ancillary school of medicine.<br /><br />As one with a profound interest in ancient history but with a complete ignorance of all things mathematical, I found the most fascinating parts of the film to be the explanations (criticised by reviewers more knowledgeable than I) of parabolas and ellipses. It had not occurred to me previously that such geometrical shapes could be sliced out of a cone. I found myself wishing that geometry had been made so interesting when I was forced to struggle through its complexities during high school.<br /><br />The film is heavy-handed with its undeniable message that religious fanaticism engenders the destruction of both humanism and humanity. I found the least interesting parts of the film to be its depiction of the social, political, and religious conflicts, which, because the film is not a documentary, were oversimplified, sometimes to the point of absurdity (The Christian fanatics picking up stones reminded me not of the Taliban but of the zealots in Monty Python's \\"Life of Brian;\\" I therefore found myself giggling when I should have been horrified). Because of this oversimplification, in which the filmmakers \\"tell\\" with terse and difficult-to-read white-on-white subtitles instead of \\"showing\\" with about 20 minutes of expository development, one gets the impression that the turmoil which brought about Hypatia's downfall was sudden, when violent ethnic conflicts in Alexandria had been ongoing since the days of the first-century emperor Claudius. This sense of suddenness was also apparent in the portrayal of Hypatia's \\"discoveries,\\" which were part of a continuum of intellectualism in connection with the great library (where Eratosthenes, who knew the world was round, had calculated the circumference of the earth). One had no sense that Alexandria had been the hub of the intellectual world for the previous six hundred years.<br /><br />Since the film focuses upon such an extraordinary woman of learning, I can't think why it was not entitled \\"Hypatia,\\" especially since the word \\"Agora\\" has little meaning to those unfamiliar with Greek, or Alexandria's history as a Hellenistic city. And Hypatia's history as a respected professor in a man's world is fascinating. Indeed, the part that rang truest for me were the charges of witchcraft brought against her, since the word \\"docta\\", meaning an educated woman, was synonymous with a female practitioner of witchcraft in the ancient world. Such charges, which were almost impossible to refute, were constantly brought against women of prominence in Ancient Rome.<br /><br />Despite the above reservations, the merits of \\"Agora\\" outweigh its faults. It is worth watching if only to whet your interest about Hypatia and Alexandria, the multicultural center of learning in the ancient world.l of Hypatia's \\"discoveries,\\" which were part of a continuum of intellectualism in connection with the great library (where Eratosthenes, who knew the world was round, had calculated the circumference of the earth).

I go to film festivals whenever I can, and make donations to various colleges for film school scholarships. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON CATFISH. It simply just doesn't deliver...I don't know who paid off the movie critics, but it's obvious that SOMEONE did. Probably Nev's family are the culprits, as they are very wealthy NYC socialites. That is all.
B003TJR2HS|2.0|I bought this because I upgraded my cover for my iphone3gs to a more protective cover(Otterbox defender) & I knew I wouldn't be able to dock it without removing the cover......& who wants to do that all the time????!!! The picture shows it with a defender case by Otterbox & a Bose sounddock, so I thought: Perfect!.....WRONG! My iphone3gs worked fine before on my Bose SoundDock Portable (charged & played music).....now it won't do either with this connector....so disappointed. It will work with my apple dock, but that was not what I bought it for. And structurally, it would be better if it provided some support for the added weight & additional height. I feel like if someone accidentally bumped it, that it might break off my dock's metal connector or damage my phone.

It is strong, easy to clean, and looks brand new even after many years of use. You could not find a better one out there so just buy it and keep it for a lifetime.<br />Follow up 2 years later: I've purchased one for my nanny, and another newly-wed; I still have the same one I've had for I don't know how many years. Hand wash when you can , I still believe it's the best press out there.
0375507256|3.0|This is my second book by David Mitchell (the first being The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet).  This time Mitchell uses a form of writing that contains six different stories; i.e. A, B, C, D, E, F and presents them to the reader in this order:  A, B, C, D, E, F, E, D, C, B, A.  There are six different character studies and definitely six different short stories that Mitchell is stitching together.  The first four are easily some of the best writing that I've ever read.  The last two are almost enough to make one throw the book out as they take on a science fiction bent that thrusts the story into the future where robots as humanoids are beginning their evolutionary or even revolutionary ascent.  The sixth chapter of events is so whacked out that I merely skimmed through it in order to get back to the rest of the stories.  This sixth novella is written in its own language that might be a cross between the Hatfields and the McCoys in the non-schooled Appalachian hinterlands.  It is nearly impossible to read and even more impossible to care about.  The very thin thread that was holding the other stories together broke on this one and I can't for the life of me figure out the meaning of it.<br /><br />Again, Mitchell attempts to take disparate settings and character studies and then with a slight dose of mystery weave them back together into a story.  That said this book is in enigma to me.  It fully grabs and engages the reader through four of the storylines and then pokes him/her in the eye with the most ridiculous two stories I've read in recent history.  Through the initial four storylines, the characters are well fleshed out and employ the reader's empathy for the limited time they are available before the next main character takes center stage.  As the time and places change and move around the globe, the characters are not necessarily destined to survive the time machine of the storyline.  This technique I liked, unfortunately, it was not executed throughout the 500 pages of the book with any rhyme or reason.<br /><br />I've read some of the other reviews as they state that the glue of the story is reincarnation.  If that's the case, it is a woeful thread to pull you through the 500 pages of very well written prose (except for the sixth storyline).  There just isn't enough glue and that is very disappointing.  If Mitchell would have spent the effort to pull everything together instead of inventing his drivel language, the story could have been a masterpiece.<br /><br />I can barely recommend this book because it shows Mitchell as a diamond in the rough with writing skills that most authors could only dream of having.  And I know in The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, he puts everything together in a terrific story.  So this is just an evolutionary process in which you can see a master experimenting with different techniques.  My additional complaint is that Mitchell's soapbox is extremely offensive to me and very trite in the realm of writers today:  Corporations are bad, communes and everyone loving each other is good.  It gets old because Mitchell is so black and white with this little agenda and he has no reality to answer the issues.ages of the book with any rhyme or reason.

B0012QE4Q2|1.0|Only a person who lived under a rock could accept the moronic premise that Henry VIII wasn't all that fond of Anne Boleyn and was in truth pining for her sister Mary.  Yeah right, and I suppose he created a schism with Rome and made his kingdom vulnerable to the Holy Roman Emperor, the Spanish Emperor and the French just across the channel for laughs.  There was perhaps no personal relationship that had more far reaching affects both geographically and historically than that of Henry Tudor and Anne Boleyn.  And clearly the person who dreamed up this nonsense never read a lick of history, for if they did they would know that Mary was a mistress to the French King before her return to England and was one of Henry's many mistresses while he was married to Katharine of Aragon.  Henry did have a son (whom he formally recognized) with a mistress, but it wasn't Mary Boleyn - it was Elizabeth \\"Bessie\\" Blount - another married subject like Mary.  That son died at age 18 and had no heirs, but at one time was a possible heir to Henry's throne before the birth of his legitimate son Edward by his third wife Jane Seymour.

0316077054|4.0|Lena and Ethan have survived the horrors of Lena's sixteenth birthday, but things are far from over. The question of Lena's Claiming is still unsettled. Will she be a Dark or Light Caster - and what will it mean for her relationship with Ethan?<br /><br />When Lena runs off with a mysterious Caster and leaves Ethan behind, he thinks it might be time to move on, but he soon discovers the only direction to go is after Lena. Ethan sets off with his trusty friend, Link; a new girl named Olivia; and Lucille the cat. Their hunt for Lena takes them deep into the Caster tunnels, where they find more trouble than they bargained for.<br /><br />The adventure that began in BEAUTIFUL CREATURES continues in this sequel and brings the reader a few steps closer to understanding the tangled relationship between Ethan and Lena.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading BEAUTIFUL DARKNESS, but thought parts of it dragged a bit. I had things figured out and thought the characters should have been able to figure out certain elements sooner than they did. I found myself wishing things would move along a bit faster so I could get to the end and find out what was going to happen to Lena.<br /><br />The slow moments weren't enough to stop me from reading, and much of my frustration was probably due to the fact that I like Lena's character and wanted to spend more time with her. She was more of a presence than present in this book, and I missed her.<br /><br />Despite my hang ups, I look forward to seeing what \\"eighteen moons\\" will bring and discovering what will happen with Lena and Ethan.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Joan Stradling
B002ZG983M|4.0|OK, sorry, I used a Clockwork Orange quote for my title....just couldn't help myself!    This movie definitely has some violence and much of it perpetrated by a young girl, so it is not for the feint of heart, conservative viewers or kids. That said, I thought it was a great romp, fun storyline and personally I like to be a little shocked now and then. I would absolutely LOVE if they make a sequel, and that is not something I say often.

0307272702|5.0|This is the best book available today as an introduction to the science of obesity from a \\"low-carb\\" perspective.  The value of Taubes is his methodology, which involves examining the historical record of science and interviewing scientists about their work rather than just arguing about biochemistry and nutrition.  This methodology and his conclusions was covered extensively in his other book Good Calories, Bad Calories.  Why We Get Fat is meant as an introduction to the topic for those who don't have the time to read through Good Calories, Bad Calories.  If you not only don't have the time for that, but don't have the time for this book, just start with chapter 16 and read through to the end.  Prior to chapter 16, the book is mostly about the science of obesity as Taubes sees it.  While I think he is basically right, the human body is so complex that the simplified story he tells is almost certainly wrong in some way.  If you're not interested in it, don't get bogged down in his explanations of hormones and receptors, just start with chapter 16.

031603438X|1.0|It is page 169, and I am giving up. This book clearly had no editor. The voice and the tense swing freely all over the map. Richards segues from \\"I\\" to \\"we\\" to \\"they\\" without a breath, and I swore by page 168 if he suddenly went to the ultra annoying \\"you\\" one more time, I'd give up and read a real book, written by a real writer.    What is it with celebrity authors? Lauren Conrad? Sarah Palin? These folks have other professions, and they think they can just wake up one day to suddenly be what it takes others years to become? It takes the rest of us at least 2 years to envision, write, sell, and publish a book (I am on my eighth). It took Sarah Palin 4 months. And take a look at Tom Clancy's latest, switching gears slightly. His name is in huge letters. Beneath it, in microscopic print, is the name of the real writer.    Keith Richards' Life is particularly unreadable compared to other rock star so-called autobiographies. Those by or about (because I doubt they really write them) David Crosby, Bono, Tom Petty, and especially Eric Clapton are excellent.     This book is a disappointment. I bought it because I love the Stones and have always saw through the image to a bunch of really smart men. I think Richards just babbled into a recorder for a few weeks and the publisher hired a real writer -- James Fox? -- to try to patch it together. It doesn't work. I can understand why people raced out to buy this, making it a bestseller. But I just don't get the stellar reviews. The man can't write, and James Fox can't save him. Stick to music, Keith.
B003BKF696|5.0|I couldn't agree more with the product review: \\"nervy, melodic, explosive and beautiful...\\" It's a smart album, with impressive range, depth of feeling, which ranges from songs you want to sing aloud to songs that make you sit and listen and think. Their best album yet and one of the best of 2010.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I got this initially because I liked Nathan's acting in the superb series \\"Firefly\\"; he's equally excellent in his role as a bestselling novelist-turned-crimefighter.  Chemistry between him and the lady detective is great, writing is outstanding.  Many twists and turns keep the plots engaging, and the photography/shot setup/camera work is excellent, along with timing and the rest of it.  Highly recommended, glad I bought this.<br /><br />-ken
B002ZG981E|2.0|Every time a Christopher Nolan film is released, it is hailed, en masse, to be the second coming of Christ in the form of a film. Christopher Nolan doesn't really make films though, he makes rollercoasters. Inception isn't something where anything is learned or truly examined as much as it is a brain twister. It doesn't engage the heart and mind and soul in any way very mature as much as it , more often than not, dazzles every human's reptilian hindbrain and excites it with shiny fancy gimmicks and contrived chases and little riddles to keep you busy while he pulls another trick out of his sleeve to make sure the next flash blinds you enough to not notice the lack of weight. While it was a pretty good rollercoaster or lateral thinking puzzle or at times both at once, as a film it was very little to say much about. The single emotional, as opposed to intellectual, string it tries to pull is pulled so sappily and so much like some kind of soap opera it got a bit sickening and tiring after a while (while it still \\"kept you guessing\\"). Better than The Dark Knight and Memento , not as good as Following and The Prestige.    On a brighter note it did in a way rekindle a certain interest in videogames and architecture and installation art (and all three together). The music and sound design were quite nice and added effective and affecting accents to many parts; many of Zimmer's eerie drones helped create a dreamy vertigo effect. The acting was competent and the overall idea is smart even if emotionless and empty on any deeper level. The special effects were done quite well with some very striking things-- the spinning hallway being the simplest but also most interesting-- and I like that Nolan, as much as possible, wanted to avoid computer effects so that things could be done just in-camera with tricks that way, which ultimately look more \\"real\\" than just about any computer graphics can even today. Even if Nolan is nothing but a Juggler, he's one of the better jugglers.
B004CAWKXE|1.0|I loved 'I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love' and 'Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge'. I could even respect 'The Black Parade' but that CD still showed many bad quality's. Now this CD I had trouble finishing I have no idea how it received any good reviews. Any band that repeats 'Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na' through the whole song doesn't deserve recognition, it is just horrible. I might recommend this to a 10 year old girl but to anyone that understands music hell no.
0316098337|5.0|As an author myself, my first thought was how is Emma Donoghue going to pull this off? A novel that takes place in a single room (at least at first) with a five-year-old narrator? At first he sounded way too mature but then I realized that this wasn't your typical five-year-old. He is beyond his years in some respects and yet completely naive in others. The hero of this novel is his mother, of course, who did the best for her son with what she'd been given. Masterfully written and totally unique. This is one of those rare novels that I won't soon forget.<br /><br />Susan Gabriel<br />author of Seeking Sara Summers

0061433047|4.0|It's difficult to think of an author who is more humane, more caring, more simply likeable than Sir Terry. He believes in people, even those he doesn't have much use for. And these traits have made him one of the most popular living authors in any language. Having said all that, it's also nice to be able to say that this is a very good wrap-up to the four-volume story of Tiffany Aching, Witch of the Chalk, Witch of the Hills, Big Wee Hag to the Nac Mac Feegles, and all of sixteen years old -- though she's been a witch since she was nine. (At least, I *assume* it's the wrap-up -- but I previously thought _Wintersmith_ was the end of a trilogy.) Tiffany has had a hard apprenticeship, what with overcoming local prejudice and kissing winter and all, but now she's got a handle on things and she stays very, very busy, looking after her people. But trouble is brewing in the form of an ancient and evil force of hatred and prejudice, and if she doesn't defeat it, it could make things very difficult for all witches -- not to mention for innocent old ladies who merely seem a bit odd. But if the evil defeats her, it will take over her body and will know everything she knows. And then the other witches will have to kill her, whether they want to or not, for their own protection. As Granny Weatherwax says, \\"We do good. We don't do nice.\\" But Tiffany has a number of uncommon skills she can call on, including her friendly relationship with fire. Meanwhile, she also has to help the old Baron prepare for his upcoming death, and help Roland become the new Baron, and figure out how to deal with the jealousy of Roland's fianc&eacute;e, who is also an untutored witch. Note that this is (theoretically) a YA book, though some people (those who think adolescents must be protected from the world) will undoubtedly object to certain themes and scenes. But, like Robert Heinlein, Pratchett produces books for young readers that will appeal to us middle-aged types as well. And throughout it all, Pratchett spins his own magic with the language, which he does better than almost anyone. A lovely book.ratchett spins his own magic with the language, which he does better than almost anyone. A lovely book.
B000AP04L0|5.0|Bought the movie not realizing that I had never seen the unedited version. Although the movie itself is great, I dont watch rated R movies and had to get rid of this one. I'm sure the general public wont care though!
B0044XV3QY|4.0|this was a great movie, it had a lot of extra footage that would have been useful in the original version, but i think the reason taht they did this is becuase they really dont want to keep anyone in the theatre for 3 1/2 hours. This movie personally to me overall, i would give it a 4 out of 5, it had a great story, lots of action, but it also had a lot of character based emotions which you need a decent amount of both to make a good movie in perspective. The only thing that i think this movie was missing was the element of suprise to the viewer, the whole time i was watching this movie it seemed like they were leading up to a twist through the entire movie, but then it never happened, i will have to say that i was a little dissapointed in that because i was able to predict the entire movie in full. if you are looking for a movie that is going to look amazing on blu ray, good story, and great differential between emoition and action, this is the movie for you, but dont go into the movie expecting a huge twist that is going to blow your mind, cause it wont happen. 4/5
B002ZG974M|5.0|this is a remarkable film, so wonderfully and lovingly made by a very talented filmmaker. some of the sequences are unforgettable, with amazing photography and simplicity throughout! quite a work of art, quite an achievement. i continually asked myself, \\"how did he get these shots?!!\\" what beautiful children! it's fun see the bonus feature when the filmmaker revisits the kids and their families. don't miss it.
B003WTE886|1.0|I generally like Taylor Swift and her music, fluffy though it may be.  This CD is like the previous two in that it has some catchy songs, a couple of poignant ones, and then some real stinkers.  Musically, I don't think this album is as good as the previous two, but your mileage may vary.  And forget the \\"country\\" label; only one song here sounds even vaguely twangy.<br /><br />All that said, the one-star rating is primarily for the lyrics.  Taylor is a 21-year-old woman now, but still writes lyrics like a 13-year-old.  You almost get the feeling that, having been denied the chance to finish her last few years of high school, she is now perpetually stuck there mentally.  Even more than on her previous efforts, she uses the sweet side of her personality as a shield while lashing out at people in pretty vicious ways -- just look up the lyrics for \\"Mean,\\" \\"Dear John,\\" and \\"Better than Revenge,\\" for starters.<br /><br />Taylor also has a bad habit of perpetually returning to the same phrases and themes; after two separate mentions of kissing in the rain on the last album, we get another one this time around.  Is this a fetish of hers?  Then there's the issue of believable storytelling.  The ending to \\"Love Story\\" was cute, if sophomoric.  The endings to \\"Speak Now\\" and \\"Mine\\" are downright twee.  And don't get me started on the unnecessary and confusing viewpoint shifts in \\"Never Grow Up,\\" a song that is supposed to be a tearjerker but largely flops.<br /><br />So despite the catchy hooks and generally cute personality, Taylor's immaturity is growing rather tiresome.  Listening to this CD is like reading a teenaged girl's diary:  It's boring, overly-emotive, and childish.  Now that I think about it, maybe \\"Never Grow Up\\" should have been the title song.  Time for Taylor to act her age and write about something deeper than get-evens and petty grudges.

B002ZG980U|3.0|There's a lot of mumbo jumbo in 'Inception'-- too much dialog and exposition, too many Hollywood chases and explosions, and an overdose of pseudopsychological pretense, certainly for a film that purports to be about the limits of human imagination.  So, of course, I watched it twice.  Bear with me: I only did it because I hate to see otherwise civilized moviegoers at each others' throats over what's meant to be a couple hours' entertainment.<br /><br />On first viewing, not having read anything but a plot summary about it, I approached 'Inception' (as I think most will) as having a level that serves as a control, that is, 'reality.'  For those with a heightened ability to suspend their disbelief, regardless of how dazzlingly opaque that which is presented to you, you may love the detail, action, plot twists and other conceptual artifice here, and go to bed feeling warm and satisfied. Five stars!  On the other hand, if you're a stick in the mud (like me) and have the type of mind that analyzes-- and accordingly accepts or rejects-- a movie's various premises as you go, you will have all kinds of problems with the logic of 'Inception,' go into a fit, call your lawyer and demand changes to your will that include Christopher Nolan being declared a charlatan somewhere in your epitaph.  One star!<br /><br />To the latter point, inconsistencies and junk 'dream science' make watching 'Inception' almost unbearable after the first hour.  Your brain simply shuts down.  For those who need examples:  Cobb tells Mal 'I don't trust you anymore,' then moments later proceeds to tie himself to her and rappel down the side of a building (I needn't bother getting into the physics of a 100-pound woman supporting the weight of a 150-pound man because-- ta-da!-- it was just a dream); in reality, pain in dreams is caused by conscious pain, not the other way around; the idea of 'inception' has been practiced since the 19th century in the forms of brainwashing and hypnotic suggestion and therefore the notion, posited by Arthur, that 'true inspiration is impossible to fake' would demonstrate a near-total ignorance of his own field of expertise; Cobb operates under the supposition that in dreams the dreamer doesn't 'know it's happening,' but most if not all of us have had dreams where we're fully aware we're in a dream and have control over all aspects of it-- his theories fall apart then; the idea of the totem is fun and an important plot thread but, again, the mind plays tricks on us, and what might be a rabbit's foot in real life could easily turn into a rubber chicken in a dream; Saito's oversimplistic explanation of Fischer's conglomerate becoming a world superpower is laughably weak, even for a MacGuffin, anywhere outside the world of James Bond; a sedative leaving inner-ear functions intact presumably would be useful only if the subject were 'kicked' in reality, not inside his dream; and so on.<br /><br />Now, before you 'believers' get upset, here's the part where I read a bunch of reviews and decide to give 'Inception' a second chance, this time from the perspective that the entire film is Cobb's conceit, several convoluted layers of dream plot and dream characters devised to fool himself in order to 'self-incept,' as it were, to gain safe passage 'home,' i.e., reunite with his family, whether they even actually exist or not.  I have to say the movie is a hell of a lot easier to digest this way, because nothing that is said or done has to make sense, as it all serves Cobb's imagined quest.  It's still overlong and too crammed with generic action-movie fluff for my taste, but at least you can appreciate what director Nolan might have been aiming for, unburdened by the chore of trying to decipher what is essentially undecipherable (OK, OK, let's call it 'subjective') material.  Three stars!<br /><br />I'm sure my fence-straddling will still offend some, but perhaps if fans and critics can find common ground at least on how to approach 'Inception'the armies of our subconscious can lay down their arms and let us dream in peace.an lay down their arms and let us dream in peace.
0553805371|1.0|The only good thing I can say about this book is that it is beatifully illustrated.  It is very rare that I give a popular physics book such a poor rating.  In fact, this is the first time I think I have ever told people not to read one!<br /><br />As a professional physicist, I think it is very important to understand the basis for all claims in science, proceed with metaphysical statements only when the scientist is fully cognizant of the limitations of such statements, and to keep in perspective the importance of philosophy in the sciences, as well as its role.  It is then no wonder why I hated one of the first statements made in the book, namely, that philosophy is dead and has no role in science.  Of course it does!  Every act of interpreting data is a philosophical act.  The formal act of developing a theory is itself an act of philosophy.  The only thing I found more mind-boggling than this statement was that Hawking went on to spend the rest of the book talking about realism and anti-realism, which is a central debate in the philosophy of science.  Hawking says nothing new about this debate, and I am not entirely sure what final point he was driving at because, as far as I can tell, the conclusion that would most support his position was undermined by numerous statements he made earlier on.  His closing statements about working toward a final theory were undermined by the fact that he says that phenomena may have multiple theories attached to it and that no single theory is more correct than the other; it is simply a matter of which is more useful.  This is strictly an anti-realist statement, yet it seems that Hawking believes a final theory is, somehow (although he doesn't state \\"how\\" this somehow could be, still possible.<br /><br />I think that this book can only be the result of one of two things: 1) Apathy toward the topic, in which case I don't know why he wrote or 2) This book repesents the waning and utterly diminished mind of a once brilliant theorist.  I would hope it is the former.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about the book is that Hawking refuses to accept that the world is governed by cause and effect.  He cites Feynman's idea of sum over histories, but this is taking a theoretical tool and proposing that this is the way the universe is, in-itself.  There has been a huge push in the 20th century toward randomness in physics.  I think the reason for this is that physicists are despairing over Hume's problem of \\"What constitutes a necessary causal connection?\\"  Moreover, physicists are also despairing over a question formally posed in the 19th century \\"What constitutes a necessary statistical inference?\\"  The lack of progress on these two questions have, in my opinion, induced despair and, consequently, indolence.  Rather than try to proceed on the natural assumption of physical science, that all physical phenomena are induced by prior physical phenomena, they are simply saying that there is no cause and effect, only randomness that is loosely governed by laws of physics.  This a position that Hawking holds to in his book, which is an ironically philosophical one for someone who thinks that philosophy is dead.<br /><br />If you decide to read this book, be sure to ask at every turn \\"Is this statement a testable one?\\"  This will provide you with a test to decide whether a statement is a scientific one or a philosophical one.e it is the former.

B002ZG97E2|5.0|I couldn't believe my husband and I went to see this in theaters three times. As soon as it was available for preorder on Amazon, I had to get it. Of course, when my husband saw I didn't get the special edition, he went into my account and changed the order. However, the extras are awesome. However, we've watched them once. The movie, though, we've watched at least 10 times. Oh, and did I mention we're both 27, expecting our first child?
0393312836|5.0|This is an instant favorite of so many people because: 1) It is very creative 2) Well-written 3) Has a contemporary feel and 4) It explores human nature, free will, and hope.  Burgess does all of this in the number of pages that few authors have proven possible.  The depth of Burgess' writing is something that I think has not been reproduced since.  When it comes to literature, the only thing I value more than complex, flowery poetry and abstraction in the guise of a novel is depth, in the sense that every sentence gives the reader many tidbits of information about the literary construction of the novel's world.  I also think that Burgess' understanding of psychology is unheralded.  Many of brief notes, often subtle, speaks volumes about the uman condition and man's response to it.<br /><br />I also like that Burgess uses the russian language as slang in this book, because I have a penchant for the language.  I thought it was an interesting and original implementation.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone!<br /><br />(note: that there are two versions of this book; the original and the american version.  The american, or Kubrickian version, does not have chapter 21.  I have been asked on many occassions why I speak of hope and free will when discussing this book, and this is due to chapter 21, which entirely changes the meaning of the book.)
1400153786|5.0|The reviewer for Publisher's Weekly seems to think Dawkins is overtly offensive to religion. Actually he's not at all. He gives religion the same rigerous scrutiny one would give any other scientific hypothesis. Well, that is the rigerous scrutiny any scientist would give a scientific hypothesis. Obviously, the reviewer for Publisher's Weekly isn't used to having his religious dogma challenged. In fact, Thomas Jefferson, whom Dawkins quotes extensively, is much rougher on religion than Dawkins. There is no question, however, that religion gets beat up badly in this book ... it's such an easy target. Frankly, religion just doesn't hold up well to serious intellectual scrutiny. For anybody already convinced, this is a fun book to read. For anybody on the fence, it is essential reading. For anybody who is too attached to dogma to keep an open mind while reading this book, read it anway, because I suspect Dawkins gets a special joy at the idea of your face turning red.
B001S31MTQ|4.0|Aldous Huxley is one of my favorite scientific-minded writers.  In \\"Doors of Perception,\\" he turns himself into an experimental subject to explore the nature of perception by way of experimenting with mescalin and having a note taker write down his every comment about the changes in perception that he experiences.  Aldous' mindset and approach are very unfamiliar to todays thinkers.  The way Aldous writes is, although unrefined, the very epitome of creative and clarity.<br /><br />I found Heaven and Hell to be equally fascinating.  In it, Aldous explores the possible relationship between concepts such as perceived brightness and supposed experiences of Heaven.  He also touches upon the idea \\"altered states\\" of reality.<br /><br />These are quick reads and are worthy reading for all.

B002QQ8HAG|5.0|This was an engaging, well rounded, and quick documentary! My thoughts were of the Devil Wears Prada when I was watching this movie, especially during any office scenes (they're near identical). But Anna Wintour isn't an evil,  lonely sad woman. She's powerful, opinionated and articualte about what is and isn't good. The people who work around her respect her as opposed ot fearing her. She has a good family life, and probably wouldn't make Anne Hathaway procure the unpublished Harry Potter book for her daughter. This documentary focuses also on thsoe who work around Anna, such as Fashion Editor Grace. She's worked there are long as Anna and is a former model. A brilliant Fashion Editor. They follow the making of the 2007 September issue of Vogue, and many shoots and pieces they do. I loved it. It seemed to short. It'll fascinate even those not curious about fashion of thef 300 Billion world it commands.

B000E6UK5K|4.0|This album is definitely on the mellow side, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.  It's truly beautiful.  The most impressive tracks to me are \\"This Heaven\\", \\"Smile\\", and \\"On an Island\\".  David Crosby and Graham Nash add some great harmonies on the latter-mentioned.  I heard that song on a classic rock station and was suprised to hear that it was a new one.  You rarely hear new songs on the radio by classic rock artists anymore; don't really understand why.  If i were to recommend someone sample one tune, however, it would be \\"This Heaven\\".  It's both beautiful and slightly rockin with great lyrics.  I've heard/seen some strange reviews in which people crap on Gilmour's collaborating with his wife(Yoko Onoisms).  That's pretty shalow if you ask me.  This album blows away his last studio album \\"About Face\\" which was w/o this woman.  Though ABOUT FACE has more upbeat, edgy songs, it lacks the melodic superiority of his Floyd songs(and most of ON AN ISLAND).  There are two or three instrumental tracks on ISLAND that help tie all the tunes together.  Those are cool to hear--almost like movie soundrack tunes.  Check out \\"Shameless Sea\\" as well.  You may fall asleep, but you will have the sweetest dreaams.  Of lesser importance, the album cover fits perfectly with the music.  I'm a sucker for a cool cover being a collector of vinyl, but it really is a beautiful  thing.  The packaging, however, is eco-friendly, but impractical if you plan to handle it a bunch.  My c.d. got scratched beyond playing within a year.  Anyway, keep it up David.  AWESOME
B002ZG981E|3.0|Does Hollywood realize that simple sells, too? Why can't we have a brilliant, fast moving movie (like Inception is) with a MINIMAL amount of visual, macho special effects? (like Inception isn't). Did we really need ALL the shooting scenes, explosions, special effects, and shaky cameras? I'm NOT a teenage boy. A lot of us aren't.     But, I can't completely bash the movie. I will give it 3 stars for a couple of reasons.     1. DiCaprio is an excellent actor. His reaction during the scene where his wife jumps off the building gave me chills! Very real there! I enjoyed him throughout the whole movie.     2. The basic plot was original and mind-engaging. \\"Stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state when the mind is at its most vulnerable.\\" Fascinating!     If Nolan could have stuck to the brilliant dream idea without all the explosions and macho melodrama, it would have been easier to pay attention to the complicated, yet fun, plot. I am so glad I didn't see Inception in the theaters....because at least at home I can try to stay awake while stretched out comfortably on my couch.
0553381687|3.0|This is a terrific tale, and Martin's prose is taut and well executed. I was pleased that he began developing his characters so clearly, turning them into real people, from the very first page (that seems to be rare in fantasy).<br /><br />But also from the very beginning, there are inconsistencies in setting that annoyed the hell out of me. I kept thinking, where was his editor?<br /><br />Two examples, from the very first chapter, \\"Bran\\". It is the dead of winter and they are riding back home, when they discover the corpse of a direwolf by the side of a river:<br /><br />\\"Ice had formed in its shaggy grey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman's perfume. Bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots, a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth.\\"<br /><br />In the dead of winter, with ice in its fur, how would the body be decaying badly enough that you could smell it? More importantly: its eyes full of live maggots? In the dead of winter? Not possible.<br /><br />Then just a page later, they realized the animal had been gored by an antler. The father pulls the antler from the wolf's throat:<br /><br />\\"A foot of shattered antler, tines snapped off, all wet with blood.\\"<br /><br />The wolf had been dead long enough to have already been infested with maggots, yet the blood was still fresh? And again, in the middle of winter, if the body had been dead so long, how could the blood possibly be wet?<br /><br />It sounds like nit-picking, perhaps, but I found the novel full of these kinds of illogical or impossible juxtapositions, where I was suddenly jolted out of the story and saying, \\"huh?\\" I understand this is fantasy, but when you set up a story with men riding horses through the forest in frigid cold, you are obligated to either be consistent with a general understanding of what winter is, or explain why in this world things are different.<br /><br />The situations and characters are rich and interesting, and Martin is a terrific story teller who is able to create powerful and poignant images. But these lower level inconsistencies left me feeling that he is careless with detail.consistencies left me feeling that he is careless with detail.

I am 50 pounds overweight and decided to do this for 30 days thinking I would see a difference in that time however I didnt los any weight nor did I feel toned such as when I do pilates. The workout themselves were ok. Personally the only one I liked was level three. Level two seemed like it should be a warmup. I didnt notice any change so I stopped after the month was up. I think that this would be beneficial to people who are \\"skinny fat\\" instead of those severly overweight.

B004132HZS|5.0|I stumbled across this series on Masterpiece Mystery, and am absolutely smitten.  All my friends are hooked now, too!    What I love:  --The characters are vibrant, multifaceted, and perversely endearing.  Cumberbatch and Freeman's relationship is both prickly and sincere--their Holmes and Watson make each other crazy, but also hold each other up.  --The playful remixing of details from the canon is a veritable scavenger hunt for nerds like me.  It's fascinating to see Holmes as the Victorian audience would have--as a thoroughly modern man taking advantage of the best technologies of his age.  --They've made it okay for Sherlock Holmes to be funny again, in that sly roundabout way I love in Doyle's writing.  The details are modern, but the tone is timeless.    What I don't love:  --THAT THEY MADE ONLY THREE EPISODES!!  Rumor has it that filming for Season 2 will begin in spring 2011, and it can't come soon enough.    --Okay, and the plotting can be absurd.  However, that doesn't detract in the slightest--I find it no *less* plausible than many of the original stories.    Overall, I recommend this series for everyone, with the possible exception of Rathbone purists and the Anglophonically challenged.  (My parents had a hard time with the accents and were grateful for the option of subtitles.)  Give it a try and I bet you'll love it!

B003V1WTMM|4.0|Kate Morton surprised me!  I had not yet read one of her books and must say that I finished this book in less than 2 days (and I don't have a lot of quiet time!).  The characters are very well developed and the scenery as described by the author is eerily realistic.  The story is divided between the past and present compelling the reader to devour the pages in order to resume one or the other of those periods.  I give it four stars in lieu of five only because I was able to solve the mysteries (and there are several) prior to completing the book and the ending in my opinion unravelled rather awkwardly, certainly not in character with the rest of the story which I found very engrossing.      I still find myself looking forward to reading another story by this author
B003O86FMW|4.0|I finished the second book, need to go out NOW and get the last.  I wish she would have left me able to digest Fire a little longer.  But the ending was no ending at all, it left me in need of a true ending. But it was good!!
0316044938|2.0|From the movie trailers and book reviews, I was under the impression that The Lovely Bones was about a young girl in heaven narrating the story of her father's obsession with tracking her murderer.  Wrong.  This book is about how the family copes in the aftermath of her murder.  This is a character-driven book and I am more a fan of plot-driven stories so I felt bored at times with the characters' feelings/experiences/observations etc. and anxious for something of actual interest to happen.  It's sad that I got excited every time the murderer came back into the story because I hoped there would be some storyline surrounding the investigation or his capture, etc.  I also did not quite understand the depiction of her heaven or how it related to anything else in the book.  I don't believe it was fleshed out very well... it could have been a key part of the story if it had been.  All in all, I finished reading this book solely because I wanted to know if the murderer was ever caught.  I honestly don't understand how this book became as popular and praised as it did - especially enough to be made into a movie.  I won't go so far as to say this book was bad... just that it really wasn't my cup of tea.
B002ZG98UK|5.0|I think most people think 3D is a gimmick and will probably fail but if you have a 3D TV and player buy this movie!  Why not?  You get 2 versions of the movie, a 3D and 2D one (its a cool bonus feature).  I personally thought the 3D was cool.

0312600844|5.0|I acquired my copy of FREEDOM about the same time I did the GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO.  I really wanted to like the latter, the backstory is so compelling, guy labors in obscurity, dies, goes viral, that sort of thing grabs the imagination, then there is the film version.  I wasn't so sure I wanted to go on a 562-page trip with Mr. Franzen, however, the so-called diffident one (remember the Oprah fiasco? Turns out he's not diffident, btw).      As things happen, I bonked on Lisbeth Salander et al after about 50 pages.  The character(s) just didn't grab me, at least not during my intial foray.  Franzen's tome I couldn't put down.  The characters, too compelling. The slow train wreck of their lives, in process, I couldn't turn avert my eyes.  The intercut narratives of the different generations - the modern cliffhanger - it surely did its job, and kept you onboard for the whole trip.   And the inherent bedeviling Paradoxical nature of the event (yes, capital P Paradox, industrial strength paradox going on here) - it was all just too compelling.  I was sorry to reach page 562.  What better compliment to an author than that?    Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.  Frrrreeeeeedddddddddom! - Wm Wallace, Braveheart.  Land of the free.  And now FREEDOM, by J. Franzen.  What do we mean by Paradox?  We were surrounded by paradox at every page, or so it seemed:    * Just the length of it is a paradox today:  a 562-page novel telling the story of three (and one-half?) generations in the age of the 140-character Twitter.  * A harrowing look at relationships, marriage, children, family - that reaffirms the merits of each, come what may.    * Franzen, interestingly however, himself is divorced, no children.  * A storyline that is consistently anti-religion, even anti-spirituality - yet ends in a faith-affirming modus operandi.  * A book whose main character realizes that \\"nothing matters,\\" - then proves that `everything matters.'    And the greatest paradox ofall, the much vaunted `freedom' that is so sought after ---- is unbearable.    August 12 2010 TIME put J. Franzen on its cover, an honor accorded to very, very few writers over the years.  Then they dubbed it No. 1 in fiction, year end.   This book is that significant, imo.  I really doubt that texting, Twitter, Facebook, or youtube rainbows have the power to move you, to explain yourself to you, and dare I say it, explain something of this thing, life.  In a way that sticks.   That, dear reader, remains in the realm of art, and that is what Franzen can do and, in fact, does.    In so doing, he proves that the novel, that literature, is not only not dead, but more vibrant an experience than ever, juxtaposed against the 24/7 onslaught of noncommunication communication we must all endure now, that is, for those still relatively few who seek it out.
B002ZG980U|3.0|I really thought the movie was very well crafted-- the acting and editing was top notch.... the score hit all the right notes....    However, towards the end it just felt like Christopher Nolan was using the movie to metaphorically beat me over the head with evidence of his directorial prowess.  That gets old....
038572179X|3.0|I read this book because I like to read a book before I see the movie.  I was a little dissapointed in this book.  I didn't connect with the characters and feel like maybe they weren't developed enough.  The author spent more time in describing rooms or objects and lost my interest.  When there are more than a page or so going into detail of a room, I find myself speed reading to get through it or just skipping over it.  The story really started to pick up midway about the time the accusation of rape came into play and that's when the characters came alive to me and I stuck to the book from that point on.  So many books out there are full of happily ever after's that are so far from reality, that it is refreshing once in a while to find a book that hits to the heart of human emotion and mistakes and regret that doesn't always give us that happily ever after that isn't always apart of life.  Though towards the end, the happily ever after was given though it was given through the eyes of the sister who took it away.  I didn't think it was an excellent read, but I liked it.
B00436GNVC|3.0|On Duffy's soph set, her voice remains, at best, an acquired taste.  The Amy-Winehouse-on-helium tone, coupled with a late-note, flailing vibrato that levitates two or more scale intervals above the original melody, makes for a loony-tunes listen.  The addition of lyrics straight from a first-grader's mash note will send you searching for the karaoke version of Endlessly - because the 60s-centric, girl-group arrangements of the songs are perfect, even when mixed with 80s dance styles.  The trebled guitar backbeat snaps on 2 and 4, the heavily tremeloed low note riffs, and the sugary string accents are a dingle-ball blast.  Even though there's no \\"Mercy\\" or \\"Warwick Street\\" that had Duffy's debut earn her a dub as the new Dusty Springfield, most of the music stands well.  Fans of such retro revamps would do better with anything by The Postmarks, leaving Duffy another year to tame her wistful warble.  ***
B003RS5JJY|5.0|You have to watch from the first season to the last to fully appreciate the show. I was slightly disappointed at the end of the 4th season but the fifth season makes it all better. Seasons 1-5 make this show by far the best I've ever seen.
B000O599WG|4.0|One professional critic referred to Howard Hawks' &#34;Rio Bravo&#34; as a &#34;super Western.&#34; Released in 1959, John Wayne plays Sheriff John T. Chance of Rio Bravo with three deputies: Dude (Dean Martin), who struggles with alcoholism the whole story, the cackling Stumpy (Walter Brennan) and, later, the youthful Colorado (Ricky Nelson). They try to stave off a rich rancher (John Russell) and his hired heavies who are intent on freeing the rancher's murderous brother from jail (Claude Akins). Angie Dickinson plays Feathers, a gambling saloon girl who develops a things for the Sheriff.<br /><br />&#34;Rio Bravo&#34; was Hawks & Wayne's response to &#34;High Noon&#34;, the popular Western released 7 years earlier. They rejected the cowardly depiction of a town of Westerners toward 4 outlaws out to kill the ex-Sheriff. It's hard to believe that any townspeople in the real Old West would have turned yella when faced with just 4 gunmen. These were tough folks, after all, who had faced Indians, wild animals, bad weather etc. to get to the West and were as familiar with guns as we are with cell phones. Many were Civil War veterans.<br /><br />A good example is the James-Younger gang, who were shot to ribbons in Northfield, Minnesota, when the townspeople got word that their bank was being robbed. Same thing happened to the Dalton Gang in Coffeyville Kansas. Both of these gangs were far larger than the 4 gunmen of &#34;High Noon.&#34; Since banks were not insured by the FDIC in those days, depositors were very nervous about unauthorized &#34;withdrawals&#34; by outlaw scum.<br /><br />Is &#34;Rio Bravo&#34; really a &#34;Super-Western,&#34; as that aforementioned critic called it? No. A classic perhaps, but certainly not a &#34;Super-Western.&#34; It struck me as a Western soap opera more than anything else, which isn't a bad thing, as I enjoy dramas now and then, but this is hardly an action-packed Western. There are four confrontations/gunfights in the first two hours before the final showdown; other than that it's all soap operatics. Which, again, isn't necessarily a bad thing; I just think it's important for potential viewers to realize that &#34;Rio Bravo&#34; is not an action film. It's a dialogue-driven drama with a few gunfights.<br /><br />&#34;Rio Bravo&#34; was shot in Old Tuscon, Arizona, and the studios of Burbank. Despite the former this is a fairly studio-bound Western, but it does successfully create the world of Rio Bravo where the viewer spends 2 hours and 21 minutes.<br /><br />&#34;Rio Bravo&#34; has a unique vibe. It's almost weird, like you're entering into this surreal Old West world, which I guess explains its cult status. Since the film has a strange ambiance it helps if you mentally prepare to watch it. It also helps to use the subtitles so you can keep track of the interminable discourses since this is such a dialogue-driven picture. For instance, the first time I watched &#34;Rio Bravo&#34; (in the early 2000s) I failed to fully appreciate it because I missed a lot of the talk. Using the subtitles really helped me appreciate the movie more.<br /><br />Hawks made two other Westerns with Wayne that bear similarities to &#34;Rio Bravo&#34; -- &#34;El Dorado&#34; in 1967 and &#34;Rio Lobo&#34; in 1970 -- but these are far from remakes, as some claim, especially the latter (only the second half of &#34;El Dorado&#34; takes the &#34;Rio Bravo&#34; route). They're all of about the same quality so, whether you prefer one or the other depends on what you want. I like &#34;El Dorado&#34; best, followed by maybe &#34;Rio Lobo,&#34; perhaps because they're less dated and far less soap opera-ee. Yet I've come to appreciate &#34;Rio Bravo.&#34;<br /><br />Angie Dickinson is a highlight. She was 28 during filming and beautiful, particularly in her stunning closing scenes, but you have to wait well over two hours to get there. One critic panned the romantic subplot between Feathers and Chance, but I found it compelling in a low-key, heartwarming way. If anything was going to be cut to shorten the runtime it should be the song sequence at the Sheriff's office with Martin and Nelson, but it has its old-fashioned charm, so I'm glad it's there. Speaking of music, the &#34;El Deg&uuml;ello&#34; piece by Dimitri Tiomkin is outstanding.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: If you brace yourself for entering the unique world of &#34;Rio Bravo&#34; this is a solid character-driven 50's Western characterized by the camaraderie of the protagonists and grace under pressure. It's largely an Old West drama limited to the confines of the town of Rio Bravo, i.e. Old Tucson (I guess that's why they called it &#34;Rio Bravo&#34;, huh?).<br /><br />GRADE: B-shorten the runtime it should be the song sequence at the Sheriff's office with Martin and Nelson, but it has its old-fashioned charm, so I'm glad it's there.

B00005N6KG|3.0|The question \\"How cheap can you make headphones that are perfectly adequate?\\" has been answered.    I just about cried when my original folding, yellow, Sony Walkman headphones finally failed. IMO they reached the level of worship previously reserved only for the Radio Shack Minimus-7 bookshelf speaker of the 70's (I still regularly use a pair) in the annals of retro-grouch bargain-audio lore.    I then actually did cry when I read the reviews regarding structural and sound quality of the currently available crop of folding units. Oh well.    These (non-folders) received decent sound-quality reviews from others, and earn a three-star (OK) rating from me for the expected tinniness. Their construction almost defies the laws of mechanical physics. So light, you forget they exist, and the overhead band is so thin, the amount of in-ear pressure is absolutely minuscule - a good thing.    I've had them for several months now, and they have yet to snap in half, which, honestly, was my first expectation. And with no volume adjuster to invariably fail, they may just be the perfect, cheap, virtually disposable, lightweight headphones. Just treat them gently, and they should last a good long while. And if they *do* fail, you probably won't feel like you lost an old friend.

0596805888|5.0|Cooking for Geeks is equal parts well-rounded recipe collection, safety manual, food chemistry textbook, and manifesto for the Maker/DIY/Geek philosophy. The main content of the book is centered around the first three, but Potter's preface, introductory chapter and the many interviews with experts convey the underlying theme: getting under the hood and trying things out.     I found C4G very entertaining, and encouraging in the way really good DIY books often are. It isn't so much that the projects end in profoundly cool results, but that you just *know* discovering new skills, and a deeper understanding of materials and processes, are just around the corner.    Throughout the book there are interviews with interesting people discussing their specialties. Some of these are short pieces, talking about a single recipe. Tim O'Reilly on jam and scones, or Meg Hourihan on chocolate chip cookies. Longer interviews cover geeky topics like knives or Sous Vide. I bet almost any reader will find a real connection to at least one of these.     The \\"Optimal Cake Cutting Algorithm for N People\\" on page 257 delighted me. The next time I am serving cake to more than five or six guests, I will definitely implement the protocol.
B003EV6DBW|3.0|Doctor Who Season 5 Review    Once again, this isn't specifically a review of the individual shows on this box set, or of the program itself, but more of a review as to the faults and ignorant oversights as to what it doesn't offer, compared to previous box sets from seasons 1-4.   If you need to know the specifics of this product, content, and episode by episode break down, there are plenty of web sites out there just for that. And if that is all you're looking for from this review, then I humbly suggest that you skip this and continue to read anything from elsewhere.      And now for those who care for something more insightful...    For starters, I payed for this, and as such, I don't want to be inundated with commercials!  After you get through all the legal stuff, and the 2 entertain and BBC logos, there are commercials for various programs on most of the discs, and for BBC America.  Personally, I feel that since I am PAYING for this program, I should be able to watch said program without having to watch any commercials.  And this shouldn't apply only to this release, but to all future releases no matter what the show or show or movie is.    Getting past that initial irritation, you should know that there is one major feature, or lack thereof, and that being there is no \\"Select Episode\\" option, only \\"Play All.\\"  But after some time, and I admit, by accident, I discovered that if you use the \\"Select Scene\\" option, you can watch individual episodes.  But for anyone to not include a \\"Select Episode\\" option on the main menu is either lazy or incompetent.    Also, there is no 3-D trailer, and I know for a fact that one was made.  You can watch it on YouTube.  So why not include it?  The one on YouTube requires the green and red glasses, but nonetheless, they should at least make it an option for those who care to get those specs and enjoy that trailer.  And since I'm on the subject of trailers, if all that was lacking isn't enough, the \\"Coming Next\\" trailer at the end of each episode has been eliminated from the original broadcast.  Now to be honest, I always skipped past this, but for the purists out there, since it was part of the show then, it should be included now.  If the BBC doesn't want to do the \\"Coming Next\\" clip at the end of the episodes for season six, then fine, at least we won't be missing anything that didn't already air.  Just don't pull a George Lucas or Steven Spielberg by continually changing that which has already been broadcast.      As for the, behind the scenes, geeks like me, there are only In Vision commentaries for select episodes.  I remember the good old days, about, oh, two years ago, when there used to be commentaries for all episodes in previous seasons, either In Vision or standard audio.  Adding insult to injury, said same commentaries for this season are in many aspects an ego boost for Moffat, and are filmed as a straight forward shot of those participating, which sort of looks like a police line up.  And even worse than that, those participating, quite frankly, look bored.  And if you didn't think it could get any worse, (hello wound, would you care for some salt?) the two parters only have a commentary for one of the two parts!  Seriously, can't you people finish what you start, or in some cases, start what you finish?  And while it's unfortunate that Matt Smith didn't participate in any of the commentaries, Karen (Amy) and (Arthur) Rory, were in the last one with the director, and that was really the only one that was enjoyable to listen to as well as watch, while they reacted to the episode.      Now for the worst part.  On the technical aspect, the damn thing gets jack up during the In Vision commentaries unless the screen resolution is manually reset to a specific setting.  It was only after reading another customers' review did I learn that some players need to be manually set to a specific screen resolution in order to avoid this problem.  (1080i)  This is all due to the fact that the Blu-Ray version wasn't remastered for players outside the UK, and so, there is a chance that, even with updating your Blu-Ray player, you may not be able to enjoy everything that this box set has to offer.  Again, this is all due to laziness on behalf of those the pressed these and allowed their distribution.     Finally, there is the last disc which contains the Confidentials...  They are not listed as being cut, but you can bet the tin dog that they are just that.  While the originals averaged roughly 43 minutes in length, those presented on the Blu-Ray are averaging 12 minutes!  One would think that since Blu-Ray discs hold considerably more data than DVDs, they should have been presented if not wholly, then at least more complete than these whittled down thumbnails.     So in conclusion, while I profess to still be an avid fan of Doctor Who, I loath the ad infused, content diluted product, which I payed for.  The DVD set is cheaper, and has no fewer features than the Blu-ray, so I would regard that as a better buy.  Or, if all you wish to do is watch the bare bones of each episode, then purchase the individual shows through On Demand, or Amazon, or anything, and save even more money, since you won't be getting much of anything elsewhere.

Using it with the holder is a tight fit, but still fits without having to remove the case.    I discarded the included tripod because I already owned a bit higher quality, sturdier tabletop tripod.    I've attached the holder to full-size tripods as well as my tabletop version.    I'd buy it again, but the change I'd make is maybe an adjustable clamp instead of (or in addition to) the spring loading.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|I first was introduced to Flo + the Machine from the Eclipse soundtrack. Their track Heavy In Your Arms was hauntingly beautiful and one of the best on the album. I then saw their live performance on SNL and was easily blown away. I bought the album the next day and have not gotten it out of my head since. Upon first listen I thought each song brilliantly different, each with its own hook that made me move, and I knew then they would all eventually grow on me. But instead of the norm with the sounds seeping into familiarity with repetition, this album inhabited me very much like a fever. Low grade at first, then bursting to flames especially once I realized each lyric. Florence Welch's lyrics are profoundly bold in their honesty, laced with morbidity about love and loss which makes them that much more demanding to be heard. Almost scary that someone so young has experienced so much, but I chalk it up to raw talent. And that is what makes Florence + the Machine one of the top artists to watch out for from this day forward. As life evolves for Miss Welch, I'm eager to hear how it unfolds in her lyrics and told by her voice, not unlike a great novel.

Worth the watch. And I hope the next one is bigger and better - both in action and in storyline and characterization.
0689865384|4.0|Title: Uglies Series (Uglies, Pretties, Specials, and Extras)  Author: Scott Westerfeld  Publisher: Simon Pulse  Edition: First Simon Pulse Edition, Paperback: March 2005  Back Cover Summary: Tally is about to turn sixteen, and she can't wait. Not for her license -- for turning pretty. In Tally's world, your sixteenth birthday brings an operation that turns you from a repellent ugly into a stunningly attractive pretty and catapults you into a high-tech paradise where your only job is to have a really great time. In just a few weeks Tally will be there.   But Tally's new friend Shay isn't sure she wants to be pretty. She'd rather risk life on the outside. When Shay runs away, Tally learns about a whole new side of the pretty world -- and it isn't very pretty. The authorities offer Tally the worst choice she can imagine: find her friend and turn her in, or never turn pretty at all. The choice Tally makes changes her world forever.      *******      Don't we all wish to be beautiful? Like, supermodel-with-hair-extensions-flawless-make-up-fresh-wax-skinny-under-perfect-lighting-and-airbrushed-up-the-wazoo pretty? Don't lie! Well, now what if it was forced upon you at the age of sixteen? Still sound appealing? Yes, we would all love to be pretty, but we all love freewill and choice as well.    This is the same dilemma that Tally Youngblood faces.       High Notes: One of the really great things about this book was how it combated today's obsession with beauty. Yes, we all want to be beautiful. But what if beauty became mandatory? Then, it doesn't sound so appealing. Yet, you know people who would do it. Don't you? Plenty of Tally's friends had done it before her. Tally's best friend Peris, who loved sneaking out in the middle of the night, causing trouble, defying authority with Tally, still went through the transformation. Even Tally considered it many times. However, she eventually runs away in order to discover what really happens when a person becomes \\"pretty.\\" Turnsout that it isn't so pretty at all.    Another high point was the development of the society Tally lives in. I've read a few dystopian novels, but this has been one of the most interesting. Everything appears to be simple, from the names of the towns (New Pretty Town, Uglyville, The Rusties, The Smoke, etc.), to the different characteristics of people who live there, to their slang. Yet, there are many layers of controversy and more and more to learn as Tally discovers ever places' little secrets.      Low Notes: The lowest note is Tally's transformation in the third book, \\"Specials.\\" As you can imagine, Tally is an Ugly in \\"Uglies,\\" a Pretty in \\"Pretties,\\" and a Special in \\"Specials.\\" (The person in \\"Extras\\" is also an \\"Extra,\\" but that's a different character.) Anyway, you get to know and love Tally as an Ugly, and even when she is turned into a Pretty she's fighting it the whole time, so she doesn't feel all that different. However, when she becomes a Special she changes a lot; almost too much. She's harder, meaner, blunter, all characteristics of Specials, but not of Tally. It takes a bit of getting used to. (If you ever get used to it.) Nevertheless, I guess it was inevitable so it's really nothing to get too hung up on.      Ratings:    Character Development: 4/5  Dialogue: 5/5  Prose: 4/5  Believability: 4.5/5  Style and Grammar: 4.5/5  Overall Rating: 88% Unique!    For this review: [...]    For my other reviews: [...]
1607886278|4.0|This book provided a real change of pace from my normal reading genres and we listened to it on CD during our Christmas season road trip.  Told from the perspective of the child it was an excellent book and VERY well done as a production where the voices really brought me to the room with Jack and his mom.  I was concerned it would be too disturbing (the whole concept of the book is disturbing!), however the approach taken allows you to learn about the event without the severe shock and traumatic horror that might have come if it was told from a different perspective. In fact, in many aspects it's lighthearted and uplifting. I highly recommend it.

Spencer covets her sister's boyfriend. Aria's fantasizing about her English teacher. Emily's crushing on the new girl at school. Hanna uses some ugly tricks to stay beautiful. But they've all kept an even bigger secret since their friend Alison vanished.   How do I know? Because I know everything about the bad girls they were, the naughty girls they are, and all the dirty secrets they've kept. And guess what? I'm telling. -A       *******       Disclaimer #1: The Pretty Little Liars Series has 8 books out so far. I have only read the first 5. So, this book review will only cover the first 5 books. I'll cover the last 3 when I read them.       Originally, I was attracted to these books because of the \\"Pretty Little Liars\\" television series ABC Family aired based off of these books. I honestly haven't enjoyed many shows on ABC Family...ever. And the one show I adored, the hilarious remake of \\"10 Things I Hate About You,\\" was cancelled after its first season. (Bad move ABC Family!) Anyway, I was in no mood to watch another show based around teenage sex and pregnancy where some stupid girl gets knocked up, then falls in love with another guy, who is really in love with her little sister, who ends up impregnated only days after her older sister gives birth, but not by the guy who knocked up the first sister or who loved the younger sister, but the mysterious foreign exchange student for Switzerland who's really a... I'm getting carried away and that sentence is not grammatically correct, but it doesn't deserved to be fixed. You get the point.     The point is that I was skeptical of the \\"Pretty Little Liars\\" television show, but I was willing to give ita go. What I found was clever, funny, and intriguing. So, I continued with the show, watching every single episode, and when it ended (soon to return on January 3rd) I turned to the books to fill the void.     The first book followed the show to a tee and I was quickly getting bored. However, the second book veered off course entirely! Soon, I found that the book and television show were two different entities with only minor similarities and there were things I enjoyed and disliked in both.       High Notes: One of the best things about the book is the number of different perspectives you are able to read. Each chapter focuses on one of the girl's point of view, allowing you a deeper look into their inner thoughts and schemes. The girls definitely develop differing personalities that are more unique than the ones in the show. There is also so much more detail in the books than there is in the show. (Obviously! Books always go into so much more detail.)       Disclaimer #2: Nearly all the low notes have to do with elements I enjoyed in the show that were not present in the books.       Low Notes: It is rare, especially in the first four books, to read about all four of the girls hanging out together. A lot of time, each girl is on her own, dealing with her own problems by herself. However, in the show, they are always together, working things out with each other. There is more ground for camaraderie and you feel like these girls truly were the best of friends at one point in their lives, and are now finding their way back to each other.     Also, the love affairs in the book are more scandalous and less believable in the books, especially the relationship between Aria and her teacher. In the books, their relationship just feels like two people's hormones firing at the same time, but in the show, they meet, find common ground, and then begin to fall in love. It feels less wrong in the show because they knew each other before they knew they were student and teacher.The final thing that really bugged me was all the brand dropping the book does. I mean, Prada this, Chanel that. It gets old after a while.     Nevertheless, I have enjoyed both avenues, especially since the show and books have begun to differ more and more. It's as though I am getting two different storylines to imagine instead of duplicates.

B001IBIHQ4|2.0|Having seen Band of Brothers and convinced that the men who sacrificed so much to win the war in the Pacific deserved a tribute that was at least as well done, I purchased the series with enthusiasm.  By the time we had seen the fourth episode, however, we were deeply disappointed.  I had read the reviews ahead of time and now find I am in agreement with most of the negative reviews that were in the two and one star category.      One cannot blame the actors; they did as well as they could with the scripts they were given.  In choosing them, however, casting picked actors that virtually look alike so that one cannot identify with anyone.  In Band of Brothers, the actors were distinctly different in temperament, appearance, accents, and one could immediately tell who you were following.  Here, that was impossible.  The script consisted of a series of poorly connected experiences punctuated with firefights.  There were no threads of continuity or sense of direction.  The music seemed like an attempt to re-create the same musical background as in Band of Brothers; the facial expressions of stress and shock, again as if imitating the other series.      The men who fought in that war are still waiting for an adequate representation of what it was like.  This series falls way short.

B0000VD04M|4.0|If you are a fan of Ed Wood's loveable trashterpiece films, then this is for you. Johnny Depp does an amazing job in captivating the supreme shlockmeister's overall enthusiasm over what he was doing, which ends up making him look sane while the others who try to talk sense into him come off as dream destroyers. The relationship between young Ed and old Bela Lugosi is quite touching. However, I would recommend that you see \\"Plan 9/Grave Robbers from Outer Space\\" or the documentary \\"The Plan 9 Companion\\" prior to this so that you can really \\"get it.\\"

0307272702|4.0|I'm not sure how I missed his first book, but this was great.  I've done Ornish and I've done Atkins.  I saw what he talked about in my own lab results, but I was terrified of Atkins in the long term because of all the \\"science\\" about fat, saturated fat, and the like. Now... I'm not so scared-- in fact, I'm a little scared not to significantly reduce carbs at this point. HOLD THE RICE, please.  But Ornish has also left me with vegetarian leanings... I wish the author would have addressed nuts and legumes a little better. Are they still so terrible because they contain carbs? (not so much when you subtract fiber)  I can't seem to go that far. I guess I'll just use myself as a guinea pig (again) and find out.  My gut tells me that Dr. Christopher Gardner at Stanford has it right. (see his lecture on You Tube-- the author refers to it) Our plates should be vegetables and protein foods-- skip the grains and starchy veggies, especially if you're insulin resistant.
B002ZG997C|4.0|First Impressions:<br /><br />Initially, you may be tempted to group the movie: The Road with this movie. In the Road, they are heading south, just to get warm, while in this movie, Eli (Denzil Washington) is heading West, to deliver his book. While both are post-apocalyptic films, The Book of Eli is much more well defined, and the objective is clear and attainable. Also, the feeling of despair is not heavily relied upon in the Book of Eli.<br /><br />Overview:<br /><br />30 years ago, just after the last big war, Eli commenced his journey west to safely deliver his book. He survives by killing small animals and bartering things that he salvages. Eli has a very calm, unassuming disposition, but is extremely capable when it comes to defending himself. Every night, he quietly reads his book and prays.<br /><br />Cinematics:<br /><br />This film captures quite well the vastness and the emptiness of the land. You get the feeling that the land is now mainly desolate, apart from a few pockets where the survivors now inhabit.<br /><br />The tempo in this film changes rapidly, one moment there is calm and the next its calamity. The fight sequences are as pretty fast. Eli delivers strong measured responses depending upon the threat. The presentation is seamless and it is a very enjoyable action film.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />This is a very enjoyable action film. While, Eli is a very good fighter, he is still only one man, and not invincible. This aspect is also well captured. Thanks to Solara (Mila Kunis) he is able to continue his journey. Watching this show is quite fulfilling, there are some very nice surprises at the end!
B0044IJ1S6|5.0|Not much to say...they are bether and bether every year, this show is amazing. If you like Depeche Mode this is one of the bests.... Go for it.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I have to say that when I saw the cover of this book, I laughed.     Don't let the cover fool you though, and don't let your pride either. If you are open to being a better mate to your partner, read this book. First and foremost you learn that every person has their own way of needing love. A lot of times, we give the kind of love that we would want in return. Although that seems like a sound principle, there are flaws in showing love that way.    It will take you no longer than a couple days to read this book. But it could better your relationships for the rest of your life.
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|This is just great storytelling.  I am particularly fond of stories...like novels... that go back and forth between interesting characters, leaving you wanting more. Clint Eastwood did a fabulous job with this subtle, entertaining and touching film about people making profound - and occasionally uncomfortable - spiritual changes in their lives. Matt Damon is at his most charming here; a quiet role that suits him to a \\"t.\\" Not sure what the critics were carping about. We sat in rapture as the film unfolded, from the incredible opening blast to the final, satisfying scene, which I won't describe here as I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it.  Whatever you do - don't miss it because of some cranky, pedestrian reviews. It's truly beautiful and moving and you won't regret it.
B001IBIHQ4|2.0|They had their chance to make a great series. They had all the tools for a great representation of the war in the Pacific and all the skills for great story-telling (as evidenced in Band of Brothers) but they blew it. Yes, we may romanticize war when it is truly hellish but some amazingly heroic deeds were done in those brutal times, deeds that remind us why we in retrospect refer to them as the greatest generation. I am disappointed. Band of Brothers was an honest but patriotic tribute. This is an apology. It does not do our grandfathers the justice they deserve.    If you love your country and have the courage to tell the tales of these men honestly (the good, the bad and the ugly) then you would have in your hands one of the greatest, most epic stories in our history. I urge you to see the series \\"WWII in HD\\". It accomplishes everything that The Pacific tried but failed to do. You will see the difference and walk away with a clearer vision of the war while still loving your country and the men that fought, suffered and died for it.
B002E2M5J6|3.0|Buy if you are a big fan. Te quality is really good and so does the sound, but this is not the best of jamiroquai. Why I bought it because of the price....
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|This book is amazing! It does take until about page 100 or so to get into the feel of the book. Don't give up, you will get used to Stieg Larsson's writing style and detail quickly, those pages are all setting up a very thrilling book. Once past that point you will get hooked, and then want to pick up the rest of the millennium trilogy !
0743277708|5.0|Watership Down. I had to read it in High School, and I am so grateful that I did. What a fabulous book. If you like to read in-depth books, that open up a complex world of satisfaction and thought; of amazing characters, which turn out to be beloved friends, then this book is for you. I've re-read it every year or so, for the last 29 years. If I only could make a list of the top ten books that I love, and read again and again, this wonderful book would be in that list. Just for fun, what other books, or Authors would be included? Pride & Prejudice. Anne of Green Gables series. The Lord of the Rings. A year down yonder. Charles Dicken's. C.S. Lewis. Little Women. The Princess Bride. Orson Scott Card's Biblical Women series. Mark Twain and Hugh Nibley. This is not a comprehensive list, but it will do.
B00428CPUY|3.0|Although the case was damaged during shipment, the discs were not broken. However,  on the 2nd disc, about 15 minutes into the performance, the disc froze, therefore we probably missed 10-15 minutes of performance by ski[pping forward.
B0047VEE0U|2.0|I like very much all the music of Alexandre Desplat. I bought this edition only to get the 5.1 sound version. Merchandising was not important to me.<br /><br />Good music but very bad packaging. Too much fragile paper.<br /><br />It was so difficult to include a DTS sound?. The score and the poor video documentary only use 710 Mbs in the DVD. I prefer a DVD Audio like the special editions of Lord of the Rings but I understand that many people doesn't have a DVD player for this format. But a single layer DVD Video is enough to contents a DTS and Dolby Digital Version.<br /><br />Packaging is really very bad. All the disks arrives out of the sleeves rolling into the box (the DVD has scratches). The Vinyl arrives with the plastic sleeve broken.<br /><br />Too much expensive to a very poor presentation.<br /><br />Please, producers. See the Box: The Music Behind the Magic (Menken & Ashman). That's really a very good collector edition.
B003MTGW80|4.0|The performances of the Beethoven symphonies (#3,#5 and #6)are outstanding. Giulini is very similar to Furtwangler in his broad and measured interpretations of these three works. The Brahms 1st symphony is good, but the 2nd symphony is much too slow. I my mind, no conductor can rival Walter or Klemperer in the Brahms symphonies. The Tchaikovsky 6th is very fine, but also meditative in interpretation. The Schumann 3rd is one of the greatest recordings of that work, and both the Debussy and Ravel have few rivals. If you remember this conductor's EMI recording of \\"La Mer\\" from 1962, this newer one is even more fresher.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|It was exactly what I ordered and was received promptly.  I would, absolutely, order from this person again!!  Awesome!!
B002ZG9774|3.0|The film succeeds with its primary selling point: the songs and dances are SPECTACULAR. I now know what it's like for women to have multiple orgasms after watching some of these sequences. Christina and co. shake it to titillating, breathless choreography. The camera knows where and when to cut, infusing every number with even more excitement but not obscuring the action. My personal favorite is when Christina's outfit is gradually flung away, leaving only a few giant feathers covering her naughty bits. Both sexy and funny.<br /><br />You don't need me to tell you how incredible the songs are. I prefer Christina's voice to Cher's (as well, You Haven't Seen The Last Of Me seemed superfluous and too on-the-nose) but I think fans of both will be more than satisfied with the soundtrack.<br /><br />The big question everyone wants answered is &quot;Can Christina act&quot;?<br /><br />My answer? YES! I say this not as an adoring fan (although I am, of course) but as someone with a degree in film. She has an easy, unforced charm that sparkles on the silver screen. No, scratch that: she's practically glowing! I am so pleased to announce that Christina actually gives one of the movie's best performances. I completely bought her character and even when the writing became weak at times, she was always at the top of her game. You can tell Christina was enthusiastic about the role and she fortunately didn't overplay it at all. I think there's a film career ahead of her if she wants it.<br /><br />Stanley Tucci clearly has the best supporting part and is totally hilarious. Only problem is, he needed to be in more of the movie. As did Kristen Bell and especially Alan Cumming. Their characters were way more interesting than those of the two male leads. I hope their scenes didn't end up on the cutting room floor.<br /><br />Besides some cheesy lines scattered throughout, my only big criticisms are with:<br /><br />1. The bank subplot which I didn't care about (although it has a clever resolution).<br /><br />2. Cam Gigandet's character and less-than-stellar performance.<br /><br />Cam doesn't ruin the movie but his role wasn't compellingly written and Christina had him licked in the acting department. She could have chemistry with a lamp but he seems to be a bit distant in the role which doesn't allow the sparks to fly as much as they should.<br /><br />Is Burlesque filled with clich&eacute;s? Well, duh! It's supposed to be a lighthearted musical in which the plot takes a back seat to the theatrics. Y'know, older films in the genre were actually like that. Sure, I prefer Moulin Rouge! but then again, that movie doesn't have any numbers by Christina.r resolution).<br /><br />2.

B003Z39G0O|5.0|For those of you wondering about this CD, I have really enjoyed it. The songs are awesome and you can just picture the scene that the song played to. My only regret, is that there are not more tracks on it or more volumes to purchase for the seasons. Whoever puts out the Twilight CD's should take a lesson from this one. The songs relate to the scenes and are enjoyable to listen to. LOVE IT!!!!!
1439177783|5.0|It's rare to read a memoir or autobiography where the author is as frank and revealing as Portia De Rossi. Unbearable Lightness describes De Rossi's long obsession with personal perfection that takes her down a dark and lonely path of purging in an attempt to keep herself rail thin while dealing with her sexuality. As she pumps herself full of a lethal cocktail of various diuretics to attain her goal, her world spins out of control.<br />This is not a happy story for the most part. Since her breakout part in the tv series Ally McBeal, her obvious batttle with her weight was chronicled on tv and the internet as every slight deviation in her size was reported and duly photographed. She tells her story in a straightforward manner, and despite her exceptional physical appearance there is such a resounding sense of truth in her words that it is a story that I found plausible and easy to relate to.<br />In getting healthy finally, De Rossi gets to the core of knowing and liking/accepting herself as she truly is.<br />This is a great introspective read for anyone who has image problems or anyone who is gay. Whatever your personal demons, this book is not only interesting but thought provoking.

0451191153|5.0|The Fountainhead is probably Rand's best work. Rand uses the characters as mere symbols themselves to portray her views and philosophy on life. She is strongly committed to the belief that the greatest man is successful because he works for the sake of passion, not for the sake of competition. Anyone who is wishing to develop their morals or ethics should definitely read this amazing novel by Ayn Rand.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|Remember that digital signals either get there or they don't.  They get there with this cable, and I see no need to overpay to get a brand name on the cable.

B004CRR9G0|3.0|The Nausicaa story was a Manga that Miyazaki wrote between other movie projects during the 70's.  It's a sprawling, wonderful story told in around 1300 pages - possibly the best Manga I've ever read, very comparable   with The Lord of The Rings with a lot of interesting philosophy and plot-twists and future sci-fi details that touch on   artificial intelligience, people attempting to live forever through science, Post-Apocolyptic tribal-warfare, etc.  It has a lot to say.    The movie version is a cut down fragment of the Manga.   Aside from the dazzling visuals, it's not very interesting.  The plot is very nature-earthy Do - gooder etc, but it's not very thoughtful.    It's really aimed at younger kids.  It's a shame they couldn't animate the whole thing.    Anyone who loves Miyazaki should definitely read the Manga - one of the best ever - it   used to be rare & very valuable but I think it's been republished recently.
1400052173|5.0|I put this book on my wish list back before Christmas and was lucky enough to receive it as a Christmas gift.  I work in the cell culture field, so it had a definite draw for me.  I have grown HeLa cells regularly, and although I knew the basics of the story behind these cells, I wanted to know more.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that this book is very well written.  It doesn't take long to get drawn into the story, and it's a true fact finding type book.  It's not overly sentimental and yet you develop a quick rapport with Henrietta and her family.  The author walks the line between science and story telling very well.  A scientist can read this and not feel insulted for want of facts, yet the layman can read it and not feel drowned in scientific jargon.

1416583432|1.0|I kept falling asleep while reading this terribly poor book about dogs. Day after day, I slogged through, snoozing, reading, moaning to myself that I should stop. I couldn't though, because I was sure there might possibly be something that I didn't already know withing the pages of this book, given the other reviews. There wasn't, though. The writing is poor, what points are being made are not clearly made, and the author doesn't seem to know some basics: raisins and grapes are toxic to dogs. She probably feeds her dog chocolate, too.
0470876417|5.0|A different kind of business world calls for a different kind of business manual, and that's what Alex Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur have achieved in their New Age guide to contemporary business modeling. Abetted by their \\"Business Model Innovation Hub\\" - with 470 online collaborators in 45 countries - Osterwalder and Pigneur practiced what they preached when they applied their modeling concepts to the book's production. And the concepts are not just theories: major companies such as IBM and Ericsson are converts to the \\"Business Model Canvas,\\" a low-tech template for brainstorming and visualizing corporate roles and processes. The book's breezy, colorful format, replete with photos, drawings, charts and graphics, belies its intensely researched and reality-grounded content. A big sheet of paper and a slew of Post-it notes are all you need to get started; that, and the combined creativity, intellect and persistence your team brings to the project. getAbstract heartily recommends this comprehensive, pictorial handbook to entrepreneurs and business leaders looking to create or redesign their business models.

B000VEQISS|5.0|Thus begins Daphne Du Maurier's classic 1938 novel of romantic suspense.  \\"Rebecca\\" is a subtle, slow building thriller with a page-turning finish, set in Cornwall in the 1920's.<br /><br />The story's narrator is a woman whom we meet as the young paid companion to a wealthy lady visiting Monte Carlo.  They encounter Maxim de Winter, an older English gentleman said to recovering from a personal tragedy.  De Winter and the young woman begin an awkward friendship that quickly leads to a surprise marriage proposal.<br /><br />Maxim de Winter brings his new bride to his estate of Manderly. The young Mrs. de Winter struggles to find her footing in a household dominated by the sinster housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, and haunted by memories of the first Mrs. de Winter, supposedly drowned in a boating accident.  When the body of the first Mrs. de Winter is suddenly discovered, everything the second Mrs. de Winter thinks she knows about her marriage is called into question.  The dead hand of the past, and a very live hand in the present, will threaten everything she holds dear.<br /><br />\\"Rebecca\\" is a superbly crafted, deliciously atmospheric murder mystery, very highly recommended to fans of Daphne Du Maurier.
0194715094|3.0|Never was a fan of books like these. I see their point in commercial language schools with new and untrained teachers heading off to Asia for their first time in a classroom. The books take care of planning and inject a soars pedagogy. For such circumstances I think the book could be seen as a easy 5 star - so I agree with the first review.<br /><br />I think that with the range of literature online, and web 2.0 tool, these concocted books will be (should be) a thing of the past: for experienced instructors.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|I bought this for my son who skateboards. He has a Sony camcorder. It fit with no problems. Cameras are so small now this grip makes it easier to hold and record while he is moving.
0817439390|5.0|This book is fantastic! He explains parts of photography that can be confusing in such a creative logical way that anyone could understand. The author is a genius. There are great colorful pictures depicting the differences in the techniques he is teaching you about so there is a wonderful visual aide on top of his easy to understand explanations. Definitely recommend this book.
B001FB5634|4.0|Like a modern day \\"On The Beach,\\" the movie version of Cormac McCarthy's \\"The Road\\" takes a grisly look at the world nearly a decade after some sort of catastrophic event has turned it into a barren wasteland with what few survivors left battling for survival. Unlike \\"On The Beach,\\" however, you get no real sense that anyone wants to pull together, or that small communities have formed to weather the end times. Obviously, some have checked out rather than even try. Instead, \\"Papa\\" (a desolately believable Viggo Mortensen) and \\"boy\\" (a spookily innocent Kodi Smit-McPhee) are trying to make their way to the ocean in hopes that maybe the climate will be safer and warmer.<br /><br />You're never given a reason why the world is dying; was there a nuclear winter? Did some sort of space detritus strike the earth ala the dinosaur extinction event? Did all those Fox News Climate Change deniers get a really nasty wakeup call? Did something happen to the Teutonic plates to cause these earthquakes and eruptions? You don't know; you only know that Papa and boy are wandering a barren planet where the only other life you see is a solitary beetle. Oh yeah, and gangs of murderous cannibal survivalists. It's up to Papa to keep boy safe, and guide him through the drifting ashes and burning landscape.<br /><br />Along the way we meet the occasional other survivors that don't want to eat you, including a scene stealing Robert Duvall, who tests the father and son's humanity, and a thief who breaks Papa's resolve. While a couple of  the scenes seem forced (seeing the hunters run down a woman for killing makes no sense...if there's any chance for survival, reproduction would seem to be a priority, wouldn't it?), but for the most part, the 'every man for yourself' scenarios seem too close for comfort. With the world dying a slow death (boy's birth in the early portion of the movie puts the timeline about 8 to 10 years into the post-apocalypse), how generous would you be? Who would you trust? \\"The Road\\" answers resoundingly, not very much. Not too many. This is a movie whose images will haunt after the disc leaves the player.wers resoundingly, not very much.

B003EYVXSW|1.0|From the trailers I thought this might be a decent sci-fi movie, but I was horribly disappointed.  There were a couple of interesting aspects, like (spoiler alert) having the female turning to male.  Obviously we know this can happen in the womb, all babies start as female, but having it happen so much later in the development of the creature was a decent concept.  But really, (spoiler alert) when Adrien Brody ends up doing the creature I thought, \\"Geez, filmmakers do men a horrible injustice when they show that apparently they cannot control their _ _ _ _ _ at all.\\"  One reviewer wrote that the creature was HOT.  Well that's definitely a personal opinion, but the creature was also a FREAK, emotionally and somewhat physically!  There are also some scenes that are extremely disturbing.  Bottom line, not for the weak of heart.

0316098337|1.0|I really can't believe I stuck with this book to finish it!  On page 149 I told my husband that nothing had happened.  When they finally tried the escape, I thought..FINALLY I get to read something. I was taken in by all the rave reviews also. I can only think they were written by sentimental mothers of young children. If you decide to read it, please do it from the library or borrow it from someone otherwise you will be wasting your hard earned money. I hated the baby talk most of all. This child is suppose to be so intelligent but talks like a one year old. My kids never spoke that childish. It slows you down on your reading to a crawl. Absolutely NOTHING happens in this book. How it ever got printed, I will never understand. I have never read this author before so I don't want to down her unfairly, but this one was just a waste of time in my opinion. I rarely give poor reviews but this one deserved it.
B001DWNUCO|1.0|This is the most disgusting, immoral, gross, movie I have ever seen in my life.  I enjoy history, but this is not a history related movie - this is porn. I am really disappointed that it is non-returnable.  Had I known the contents, I never would have ordered it. It should be rated  and labled \\"xxx\\".
0896898288|1.0|It was so disappointing to see that so many of the letter writers felt the need to glorify their country life by denigrating the city life.  Right there in the first letter the town wife is described as the supplicant, having to ask her husband for money.  Really?  The cliches and the stereotypes are all here.  I suppose if these letters are the real McCoy then I shouldn't criticize them.  But it makes for very unpleasant reading.  I'm going to return this book to the library and get back to my quilting with the fabric I bought with my own, personally earned money...in the city.
B002ZG98LO|5.0|I finally got to see this film. This film that I have been waiting for since I heard they were returning to a jungle.    Predators tells the story of how a new trio of predators hunt on an alien planet. They hunt all kinds of alien predators - including humans.    Starring Adrien Brody as a mercenary, Topher Grace as a doctor, Alice Braga as a sniper, and Laurence Fishburne as a crazy dude who's killed a couple predators while surviving on the planet.    This film has everything that lovers of the Arnold movie had. It takes place in the jungle, the humans  have huge guns and the predators don't show up until well into the film.    You don't need a deep character-driven plot to keep this movie entertaining, however there is a nice twist at the end. Some will see it coming, but the action is what makes this film.    I'm not sure how I feel about the predators using dogs and a bird to help in their hunt but I understand the need to continue the mythos of these creatures.    There is also the high use of bad language. You just have to have this in a good predator movie.  Who knows if there will be a sequel but this was a winner.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|I recently saw this series on T.V. and I could not understand why Discovery would replace the dynamic,naturalist David Attenborough with the shlocky daytime host Opra Winfrey. The series was unwatchable with her raspy voice, monotone dialogue and dumbed down comments. Why are they re-releasing these documentaries with these narrators that ruin productions? My husband purchased the BBC version of \\"Life\\" and it is amazing.If you are not satisfied with this version, return it and get the version created for educated individuals, not the Opra Winfrey narration.
B0002XDODU|5.0|Great Product! The packaging was even cool. It looked like it had circumnavigated the globe before plopping down on my front porch. :D
B0047O2HJW|1.0|The music is marvellous. The sound is amazing...but I would like to share with you that the packaging and handling of this expensive item has been very poor. It had no protection at all during the shipping and the box that contains the Lp's is cracked and its appearance is terrible. I am very disappointed with Amazon, I thought they were professional. What can I do now? Do I have to send the full box back and pay the shipping back?
B002ZG977Y|4.0|I guess I don't understand the haters of this film. This was a fun pop-corn movie. You will always have the students of mythology hating anything that isn't verbatim to their gods and you will have those who hate anything re-made.    Clash of the Titans is the story of Perseus, a son of Zeus, who must kill the kraken before it destroys some humans.    Starring Sam Worthington as Perseus, Liam Neeson as Zeus (and really who else has the voice of a god?), and Ralph Fiennes as Hades, this film is as entertaining as any summer blockbuster.    You have a group of men fighting giant scorpions, trying to take the head of Medusa, and riding a flying horse.    The special effects are great. Go along for the ride and enjoy spectacle.    It will be interesting to see what they do for the sequel and I think I'd like to go back and watch the original because the effects they used for that movie was state-of-the-art at the time.    Don't listen to the haters, this is a decent movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book! It is everything genre fiction should be: original within the genre constraints, compelling characters, a whole story in itself regardless of sequel potential. I was thoroughly entertained and plan to buy both sequels.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|This movie is amazing.  You can see that it really has everything you need from a movie; love, horror, mystery, excitement.  No matter what age you are, it will keep your attention.  The graphics are from the early 90's and look a little different than Avatar, but still good.  The extras with the DVD are great to watch and the extended scenes are fun.  I can see why they left them out though.     Great DVD.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Either you want this or you don't. Either you enjoy the Star Wars films or you don't. I don't want to hear any of this nonsense about the \\"originals\\" or the special editions. WHATEVER! It's Georges baby and you are either on board, Jar Jar and all, or you are not. Honestly any reviewing sword casting aspersions on the new editions are semantics at best. If this came out when you were 7 you'd have imploded from excitement. Even negatives like Han fired first has become an entire joke industry in and of itself and who knows, maybe George intended it and he is light years ahead of all of us. Either way, he changed my childhood, my direction in life, and even my kids lives with interesting fantasy and hero adventures. Seriously, there are an entire galaxy, (far far away) of things to complain about before you start complaining about Star Wars. We all know the films. We all know the quality will be top notch. He invented THX Sound for crying out loud. I doubt the set will be below par. And if by some phantom chance they are lame, I'll be happy to come back here and amend my speculation. I love those that are down on Amazon for allowing reviews before the product is out. You guys just don't get business. What is going on here right now before the release is called \\"buzz\\" and it's a retailers dream scenario that a bunch of nerds would all congregate and debate the minutia of an upcoming product. Any press, buzz, or chatter is good for business. And finally, if you are down on Star Wars and you are here making noise how lame it all is, well, you and Jar Jar can be BFF.
0812550706|4.0|I first saw this book on a required reading list for the US Marines. (I was never in the Marines) I was curious why a SciFi book would be among the required list for our country's warriors, so I was intrigued enough to pick this up.    The first thing I would say to watch out for is that the main characters are all children between six to nine. Definitely not a deal breaker, since I finished the book and enjoyed the telling. The funny thing is what I found most relevant was, as a manager, Ender's ability to recognize and utilize the strengths and weaknesses of the people he commands. He is also a brilliant strategist, often times knowing what his enemies will do before they do. This combination of chain of command and strategizing is most likely what got it on a list for the military. Even though most NCOs wouldn't want their subordinates to break the chain, like Ender did.    I believe this book became a worthy entry into my permanent library, as Ender learned to skillfully navigate a zero-gravity battlefield, to use its challenges to his advantage. I also like that Card threw in the game Ender got to practice on to master his craft, and the result of him becoming so efficient at it. Also, I found the addition of the Formics, and how their relationship with the reader unfolds, a bit of an easter egg, as I based most of my judgement on known earthy hymenoptera. And, like most others, I think Bean deserves his own book, or maybe even a series.      Since, I don't relish SciFi as much as the average geek, I was surprised I enjoyed as much as I did. I attribute this to Card's simple style of writing, and skill as a story teller. So, to whom would I recommend this to? Men 14 -25 or 35 if your a gamer nerd like me. Other than the Battleroom sequences, which make the book worth reading by themselves, it reminded me a lot of something J.J. Abrams said about how Star Trek: TOS was like watching submarine warfare. Was it just me, or was Mazer Rackham a failed hero like BiggsDarklighter, that Wedged his way into the annuls of history like Yoda.     This book deserves the praise it receives. This is a keystone piece of SciFi literature, a gateway book to draw me into a genre I found difficult to appreciate before. For that, I would like to thank the author.
B004A8ZWT2|5.0|I absolutly loved this movie, i saw it with my boyfriend and it was girly enough for me and enough action for him! we are buying it as soon as it is released on blue ray! i suggest for anyone who loves romance and a little danger to see this movie!
B000H6SXMY|4.0|I had watched some episodes of the series before I bought this so watching it completely was very fun and exciting!!  I had some trouble with the booklet which was missing but i claimed and they returned me 8 bucks, the book wasn´t very important to me so it didn´t really affected me.  overall, it was a great decision buying this except for buying it to a third party who wouldn´t accept a devolution for the book,but apart from that it is great!  The series is extremely funny and it´s so long that when you finish it you may start again and it´ll still be funny!!!  from 1 to 100 i give it a 90 or a 4 stars and a half!!
0312539525|4.0|This book is a fictionalized account of the life of George Mallory, the first person who (may) have managed to reach the summit of Mount Everest. The story flows really well, the setting is authentic and interesting and, even though people familiar with the actual facts involved will know how the story ends, I still found it exciting. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction and/or books on mountain climbing.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Beware of some spoilers.         After viewing *Black Swan* twice, I'm convinced that Darren Aronofsky does not intend for this film be taken at face value. On the surface, *Black Swan* seems to exploit the crass stereotypes that bad girls invariably have more fun, and that women galvanize their desire for power by competing with other women. Aronofsky--a talented director fascinated with the nature of obsession--exaggerates these cliches to the point of satire in *Black Swan.*         Nina Sayres, the ambitious young dancer portrayed by Natalie Portman, is an infantalized, pink-wearing, obsessive perfectionist to an extreme. On the other hand, her rival Lily (Mila Kunis),embodies the current ideal of uber cool: a druggie sexpot with a cloyingly breezy manner, she urges Nina to engage in chemically enhanced transgressive behaviors. Within the context of this film, the ballet *Swan Lake* provides the perfect vehicle for exaggerating the madonna/whore dichotomy that continues to plague Western culture. Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), the ballet company's lecherous director, and the film's primary spokesperson for this stereotype, constantly emphasizes the distinction between the chaste white swan and her profane alter ego, the black swan. Pompous and shallow, he has accepted this stereotype uncritically and perhaps has something to gain from it, since he obviously finds femmes fatales sexually titillating.          Thomas's misogynistic and manipulative attitude seems at first glance to drive the film, especially since Nina takes seriously his command that she appropriate the black swan's dangerous sexuality. His perspective, however, must not be confused with the film's dominant point-of-view, which engages in the campy and occasionally comical exaggeration of these stereotypes. From this standpoint, Thomas is as ludicrous as the ideas that he constantly hypes: he is simply a mouthpiece for the nefarious cultural beliefs that nearly drive Nina insane.       While somemay argue that the madonna/whore stereotype no longer exerts cultural force, one needs to look no further than Hollywood to see that it still exists. A director who usually works outside of the mainstream Hollywood system, Aronofsky has created a work that brutally satirizes the show business stereotype that women must be sexually manipulative in order to survive. In a telling moment early in the film, Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder), a drunken dancer on the verge of retirement, calls Nina a \\"whore\\" for \\"stealing\\" the role that should have been hers. The implication in this comically campy scene is that that one aging \\"whore\\" has simply been replaced by a younger rival--one who must prove her worth in a system that may either venerate or denigrate the conniving and seductive woman.        By satirizing Hollywood's fascination with femmes fatales and female rivalry, Aronofsky symbolically thumbs his nose at as system that continues to promote a distorted view of women's sexuality. He sets out not merely to entertain the viewers but to challenge them by rendering these stereotypes as comic and grotesque.
B0037IMTR4|4.0|Very happy with the product. It's a little bit larger than I thought but still small enough to wear as a watch plus all the additional features.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Great detail.  Really enjoyed reading this book.  Full of twists and polictical intrigue.  If you like mysteries I would reccomend this book.
0380977273|3.0|This was a creepy, disturbing book with an ultimately hopeful ending. It was much more analytical and philosophical than I expected, thinking it would be more of a traditional horror plot without a lot more. While some of the long speeches from Will's father got a little tedious, the main point -- that evil feeds on sadness and despair and can be vanquished by happiness, laughter and love -- was excellently woven into the plot. Will and his father are great characters, juxtaposed against Mr. Dark and Mr. Cooger and even Jim, who has both light and dark in him.
B000OONQ9O|1.0|The Blu-ray has a sharp picture, decent sound, and some nice extras. However it does not include the original version so it sucks.
B0021L8V0M|1.0|This movie was horrible, and not only do i want my money back but the time I spent wantching it as well  1) plot there was none  2) acting, well since the whole movie was her running around there was none  3) story line so unrealistic it was impossible to believe  4)Bad, Bad, Bad, bad, bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  certainly do not waste your money but I don't even waste your time when it is out on HBO or netflix or what ever.
B0014I4KH6|3.0|Good CD, but beware that Amazon doesn't tell you this is the edited version. Not that Taylor Swift is excessively obscene to begin with, but some of the lyrics on this CD have been edited from the original.<br /><br />Maybe good for you, maybe bad. I'll still listen to it, but I generally prefer the unedited versions because I want to hear the original intention of the song, not the radio edit.
030726999X|4.0|This is the third and final book in the Lisbeth Salander/Millenium series. Collectively, this is one of the best mystery series I have read in years. That said, this was my least favorite of the three books. I liked the book, don't get me wrong, but it was the weakest of the three. I think the problem is that Lisbeth Salander, arguably one of the greatest female protagonists ever created in a mystery series, is less centrally involved in the plot of this book even though she remains a central focus in terms of the point of the story. The parts of the story where Lisbeth is actively involved are great but parts of the book get a little bogged down in Swedish secret police history and the investigation into how that organization developed. While interesting, those parts of the book were less riveting and sharply focused. In addition, the book goes off on something of a tangent involving Erika Berger, the editor-in-chief of Millenium, which is not related in any way to the central premise of the novel but instead seems to be yet another opportunity for the author to explore violence against women and/or the reaction strong women have to being victimized. Again, while interesting, this was not related in any way to the overall plot of the book and was something of a distraction. Overall, the book provided a very satisfying conclusion to the series and the ongoing saga of Lisbeth Salander's past (and, in some ways, her future). The central characters, Lisbeth and Mikael Blomkquist, are unique and compelling, even if not always entirely likeable. I would recommend this series to ANYONE that enjoys a good mystery/suspense/political thriller.

B00425S1H8|5.0|I just wanted to state that this is a perfect USB to Serial Converter for use with the Linux OS. I had been looking for a USB/SerialConv and noticed that this one, and this is key, has the Prolific PL2303HX Chipset. Which, for most newer Kernels, is plug and play. I would have liked to seen a review like this when I was checking the item out but was pretty sure on the chipset. So I thought I'd give a review in case other Linux users are wondering. Anyhow, I took it out of the box, plugged it in, and had a ttyUSB* device show up in # dmesg. I didn't use the CD at all. The CD is for winDoze users. Worked great with Novell SuSe and Debian. Price? Just right! Ok folks, have fun...
B000F8O2OM|4.0|I originally bought first the movie that started it all, then a set of 2 direct to dvd movies plus the pilot. That did it. I was hooked. I took advantage of a Black Friday and got the first three seasons. The rest is history... I might get SG Atlantis!<br />The series has great character definition. All characters grow on you and the chemistry among the cast is evident. The visual effects still look good, even without considering this series is twelve years old. The stories are consistently good, with one or two duds, and I like the fact that many are stand-alone episodes, while keeping a defined storyline.<br />Highly recommended, any science fiction aficionado would love to add it to her/his collection.
0553381687|5.0|The sheer breadth of imagination necessary to create this book, the first in the Song of Fire and Ice series, boggles the mind. George Martin has created a world with depth, complexity and beauty, even in its complete strangeness. This book is like combining the bloodiest of history, like the War of the Roses, with the beauty and depth of Ken Follet's Pillars of the Earth and the pure fantasy of The Lord of the Rings. It has anything and everything you might want, political intrigue, war, romantic entanglements, betrayal, loyalty, honor, coming-of-age moments, sibling rivalry, sword-fighting, revenge/vengeance, redemption, exotic animals...the list could go on and on. And, although this book is the first in a series and clearly there is much more to come, it stands on its own very well. I can't wait to see what happens next.

I have already used this as a resource to find just the inspiration I needed to jump-start a project!  I can't wait to get working on some of the other ideas I got from browsing the pages of this motifs book!
0307269752|5.0|This is a terrific book, even better than I expected. It started off a little slow, with about 50 pages of somewhat dense material on Swedish financial journalism. But this book is well worth the patience needed to get into the meat of the story. The plot itself is intricate, interesting and original -- what starts out as an investigation into a seemingly \\"locked room mystery\\" from a single day in 1966 morphs into an investigation of a major mystery covering decades of misdeeds and numerous different individuals. But what really drives this story is an incredibly unique, arresting, complex character who plays a central role in the story. Lisbeth Salander is a freelance investigator for a PI firm who is drawn into the investigation headed by Mikael Blomkvist, a disgraced investigative journalist licking his wounds in the wake of a libel conviction. Lisbeth is brilliant, quirky and utterly compelling. To call her a \\"heroine\\" is to redefine the term....but in a great way. Blomkvist is also an interesting character, although less compelling compared to the unforgettable Salander, and the development of their relationship (working and otherwise) brings an added dimension to the story.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|My husband has been wanting this dvd set for quite awhile, so was very happy when I gave it to him.
0439023521|5.0|This book, the first in the Hunger Games trilogy, is unbelievably good. book is set in the U.S. in the future, after events have transpired resulting in the U.S. becoming a new country called Panem, which is divided into thirteen districts around the Capitol, which has imposed a firm dictatorship on the people.  The book centers on Katniss, a young girl from \\"District 12\\", one of the poorest districts from the coal-producing region.  Every year, the districts are forced to participate in the \\"Hunger Games\\" as an object lesson of the Capitol's power and dominion over them.  One girl and one boy between the ages of 12-18 are selected from each district to fight in a to-the-death competition in an arena created by the Capitol.  This is mandatory viewing for the entire country.  Katniss ends up as the female contestant from District 12 and must bring all of her survival instincts with her to have any chance in the arena.<br /><br />This book is similar to other \\"survival of the fittest\\" books like The Long Walk by Stephen King and Battle Royale by Koushon Takami and it has the same horrifying can't-put-this-down fascination as those books.  In addition, however, this book has more character development and more surprising elements than in those books. Particularly in the later books in the trilogy, the author is able to really develop the political, philosophical and emotional aspects of the situation rather than just focusing on the \\"action.\\"  Katniss is such an interesting character, with tons of depth, and she is only the first in a strong cast of interesting characters. The development and complexity of her feelings for Peeta (the male contestant from District 12) in the context of the game was incredibly interesting.<br /><br />Although this is technically a \\"young adult\\" book, its appeal far surpasses that genre.
B000001GK0|5.0|There have been a couple of reviews that should be dispelled. The tempos chosen are perfect and not too fast......Karajan reigns in the young Zimerman's virtuosity to musical ends. Recording quality is excellent. A full blooded reading of both concertos that compares favorably with about every other major rendition available in the catalog. The Berlin Philharomic are in top form here. Highly recommended!
0385732554|4.0|This has to be the creepiest young adult book I've ever read. Reminiscent of books like Brave New World, Anthem and 1984, it is set in a fictional future world in which \\"Sameness\\" is the order of the day, even to the point where color has been leached from the world. All choice is removed from society and everything is rigidly controlled by a group called the Elders -- clothes, appearance, occupation, family relationships, breeding -- and no deviation is permitted. The main character is a boy named Jonas, who begins to question why his world functions as it does and whether doing so makes sense when he is given the highly unusual occupation of Receiver of Memories, pursuant to which he becomes one of only two people in his entire community with knowledge and awareness of how the world was in the past. This is a great book, chilly in its implications and shockingly easy to imagine.

0525423842|4.0|This is a very solid story that makes the legal profession accessible to people of any age. It tells the story of young Theodore Boone, a middle schooler son of two attorneys, who has an intense fascination with the law, particularly criminal trial law.  Theo is well known at the courthouse and among judges and lawyers there.  He becomes involved in a murder trial when he stumbles across evidence that the person likely to be acquitted is, in fact, guilty. That said, I found the ending to be a bit anticlimactic and cut off a little too quickly. But I LOVED Theo, he is warm and quirky and earnest, and I hope to see more of him. He is like a modern day Encyclopedia Brown for young adults.
B000UH8BTK|5.0|Got this a couple of weeks ago and have been playing it constantly ever since. While \\"I Sing the Body Electric\\" is as challenging as I remember, being able to trace the evolution of the group through this collection is incredible. Sweetnighter is a transition album to the new sound that Zawinul was striving to create (125th street congress & Boogie Woogie Waltz are highlights)which begins to crystallize on Mysterious Traveler with pieces like Nubian Sundance, American Tango,and Cucumber Slumber. I remember trying to figure out how to listen to this music because it was so incredibly different from what Return to Forever, Mahavishnu Orchestra, and Tony Williams Lifetime was doing. Mysterious Traveler introduces Alphonso Johnson on bass and Miroslav appears on only one cut and was his last appearance with the group.    As other reviewers have mentioned you don't get \\"Tail Spinnin\\" which I missed but fortunately \\"Black Market is included which was the the album where Jaco was introduced and you get to hear both Chester Thompson (who went on to join Genesis) and Narada on drums. For many this is the best Weather Report album eclipsing Heavy Weather and I might have to agree.     The last cd included is Night Passages which many folks have dismissed but is interesting release presenting the band in a \\"live\\" studio environment with a more stripped down sound and Erskine appears on drums. The highpoint of the cd is Jaco's incredible composition, Three Views of a Secret\\".     After hearing this collection you'll long for Birds of Fire, Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy, Thrust, Bright Size Life, School Days, Blow by Blow, No Mystery, Land of the Midnight Sun, Believe It, as well as Jaco's 1st solo album. This was jazz fusion at its best!!!
0385342039|4.0|This is a great book in the chick lit genre and nice deviation from Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic series. I tend to prefer the non-Shopaholic books from her and this book delivered. The main character, Lara, actually has quite a bit more substance than a typical Kinsella main character without losing any of the charm and endearing qualities. The story begins at a funeral for Lara's 105-year-old great aunt Sadie, who Lara has never met. Lara realizes at the funeral that she somehow can see and talk to Sadie's ghost, who implores her to help find a lost necklace that has deep meaning for her. This starts Lara on an adventure that quickly becomes much more than a simple errand for a dead relative, forcing her to reevaluate things about her career, her love life and her overall life outlook. This book was fun and light without being 100% fluff. A very fun and enjoyable read.
B00000JPH6|5.0|This is ONE of the GREASTEST movie of all time. It will make you cry when you see the ending of the movie really romantic.
1423101499|4.0|I love this series and this is one of the best books so far. The premise of the series is just fantastic -- the gods and goddesses of Greek mythology are real and have taken up residence on Olympus in North America. Percy Jackson is a demi-god (half-human half-god) son of Poseidon. In this installment, Percy continues his journey to save Olympus from the threat of war by the Titans and the ancient monsters supporting them. Percy and Annabeth are sent on a quest to find Daedulus in the Labyrinth. The plot is wonderful, full of both lots of action/adventure and some additional character development on the main heroes of the story. Percy, Annabeth, Tyson, Grover....they are all just fantastic characters. This is a smarter-than-average young adult series that brings history and myth to life but also manages not to lose its youthful appeal and adventure.
B0041OOJNU|5.0|LOVE Shakira! she is simply ah-mazing and never lets me down. saw her in her sale el sol concert tour a few months ago and it was the best night of my life!
1400079144|3.0|If you liked Angels and Demons and DaVinci Code, you will probably like this book. That said, I thought that the \\"background\\" on some of the scientific stuff about Noetic science was a little heavy-handed, as was some of the dramatic suspense elements (the revelations were \\"astounding\\" and \\"mind-blowing\\" etc.). Dan Brown has effectively mastered the ability to move a suspense plot along quickly with the appropriate amount of twists and surprises. I liked most of the characters and especially liked the D.C. setting as I am familiar with a lot of the venues/buildings referenced in the book. Overall, I thought it was a decent follow-up to DaVinci Code.
B0043ZDU1E|4.0|Another good Loreena McKennitt album.  Only disappointment is no lyrics on the liner notes for CD.  I'm not familiar with most of these traditional songs so I guess I'll have to do some \\"googling\\".
0375842209|5.0|This is one of those rare books that manages to be wonderful despite having a very difficult and painful subject matter. The book puts a totally new spin on the plight and position of Germans leading up to and during World War II. The story is told from the perspective of Death, itself an interesting plot device. Death tells the story of the book thief, a young girl named Liesel, a young German foster child. The story unfolds like magic, with amazing imagery, characters and tremendous emotion. Although the subject matter of this book is not my typical preference, I was totally captivated by the story and literally could not put this book down, finishing the 550+ page book in 24 hours.
B00029LNHS|5.0|I have been a black eyed peas fan for some time now. Their music seems to keep popping back into my life. I love their uniqueness and versatility. Not to mention some sick beats and catchy songs. This is a used cd but appears in great shape and plays with no problems.
030745455X|5.0|Lisbeth Salander may be second only to Edmund Dantes (from the Count of Monte Cristo) as the most interesting and compelling character in any book I've ever read. This is the second book to feature Salander, after Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, and it is even better than the original. The focus of the book is on the murder of a journalist and a sociologist, both of whom were working on an explosive expose of the sex trade in Sweden (the former through an article and book and the latter through her doctoral thesis). Mikael Blomkquist becomes embroiled in the investigation, since his magazine was working with the journalist and Lisbeth is ultimately drawn into the drama as the lead suspect in the murders. The plot is expertly developed and explodes off the page until the very end. But the real strength of these books is the utterly compelling puzzle that is Lisbeth Salander.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|I bought this cd for my husband for Christmas because he seemed to be a fan. He loves it and hasn't stopped playing the cd on our road trips. Their songs are very unique and catchy. I like most of their songs and wondering when they will put out their next big hit.
B00280LYIC|4.0|I loved this book, which was the first book in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. The book is about a boy who finds out when he is 12 that he is a \\"half-blood\\", meaning that he is half human, half god and the son of one of the gods of Olympus. Just as Percy begins to understand what this will mean for him, he is sent on a quest related to his parentage to resolve a dispute between the gods before things erupt in an all-out war. The book is a terrific blend of fantasy/adventure with classic Greek mythology. The premise is clever, the book is fast-paced and well written, and the characters are very likeable. I will look forward to reading the other books in this series.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|When a mysterious young woman shows up in the small town of Southport, North Carolina, the townsfolk are curious, but they open their arms to welcome her.  She rents a small cottage at the end of a gravel road; starts working at a local diner; and soon finds herself shopping regularly at a market owned by a widower with two small children.<br /><br />Katie Feldman has secrets; she has had traumas that have left her vulnerable--and shop owner Alex Wheatley, with a background as a military detective, suspects some of what she's hiding by the behavior he observes.  But he doesn't probe.  He doesn't do anything that might cause her to run.<br /><br />Settling into the cozy, safe haven she is building, Katie almost begins to feel comfortable again.<br /><br />Meanwhile, we begin to read about someone in Boston--a man, Kevin Tierney, who is unraveling slowly but surely as he searches for his missing wife.<br /><br />A compelling and page-turning saga with elements of mystery and romance, [[ASIN:B003JTHXOK Safe Haven]] grabbed my attention from the first page and held it until the very end.  The tale is rich with characters like Katie and Alex, the two children, and a few of the townsfolk whom we can visualize by the author's descriptions, as well as by the dialogue that shows us the cozy, enfolding circle of warmth provided by this setting.<br /><br />Then at the very end, an unexpected twist arouses that prickle of something extra...something that changed my perspective on many of the events.  I developed goosebumps and then wanted to immediately reread the book, to see if I could notice a clue earlier in the story.  I'm definitely giving this book five stars.
0399156577|4.0|This is a classic Nora Roberts book in the best sense of the word. The book is set on an island in Washington State near Seattle and the main character is Fiona Bristow, a dog trainer and canine search-and-rescue volunteer. Her life begins to change when a local (handsome, brooding, somewhat taciturn) artist brings his new puppy to her for training. Things get even more complicated when Fiona's past -- including her near-death experience with a serial killer -- comes back to haunt her. The book is, as always, well researched, vividly portrayed and filled with likeable and compelling characters. As long as Nora Roberts keeps writing, I will keep coming back for more.
0783225857|5.0|This is such a low-keyed movie that is so well done, you just want everything to stop for a while after seeing it. Soak up the movie, the town, the events, the music and the characters -- because the movie is over and you're not going to see them again (until you rewind or press the go button). The one scene that captures the essence for me is the revealing of Boo Radley (Duvall) behind the door. Everything -- music, tension, relief -- come together. This movie is a view of small town America that is both real and idealized. In spite of the hate and differences we all have, in the end we can only hope to do what is right and just.  Update 06/04/2015 This played on cable television (TCM) recently. The audio balance over the broadcast favored dialog and kept the music way back. As a result, the scene cited above lost its climatic effect. If you like this movie, get this DVD version (can't vouch for the audio in other versons). Only shows how much Elmer Bernstein's score adds to the viewing.
006123141X|4.0|This is a great installment in the Sigma Force series featuring Painter Crowe and Gray Pierce. In this novel, Gray sets out to investigate three murders on three continents, in which all three victims are marked by a Druidic pagan cross burned into their flesh. The plot was well structured, quick-moving and full of action. It advanced some of the continuing plotlines concerning the personal lives of the main characters, including Gray and Monk Kokkalis, as well as the plot concerning Sigma's growing adversity to the shadowy organization known as \\"the Guild\\". At the same time, the plot completely stood on its own so that this book was not just a bookmark in a larger story.
B002VWNIAY|4.0|There's been so much hype laid on Casablanca that you might feel like you're getting set up for a big disappointment. Not so. There may not have been the \\"Bogart and Bacall sizzle\\" between Bogart and Bergman, but Bergman was a better actress who, IMHO, sizzles on her own. Compared to Bogart's other expatriate patriot movie, To Have and Have Not (with Bacall), Casablanca came first, during the earlier years of WWII, so the politics seem more real. Worth seeing over and over.
0439023491|5.0|This is the second book in the Hunger Games trilogy and I wondered whether it would be as good as the first one. It was both totally different and totally in sync with The Hunger Games. Katniss's return to District 12 and the problems arising in connection with her return make for a very interesting story. The main characters that you want to see again -- Katniss, Peeta, Gale, Prim, Haymitch, Cinna -- are all back in the story and you get to know them better. But the plot is substantially advanced and a whole host of new characters are introduced. My personal favorite is Finnick. The Games themselves are revisited with the Quarter Quell (the Games marking a quarter anniversary, this time 75 years) and that whole part of the story is told in a fresh and interesting way. Although this is the second book in a trilogy and there is some movement toward what you know will be the subject of the third book, this book stands well on its own. I couldn't put it down once I got started and I ended up liking this one at least as much as the first one.
B000A7S4B0|5.0|After the not so spectacular \\"Take Them On, On Your Own\\", BRMC, the San Francisco band came on like a freight train with \\"Howl\\" #90. (What a crime, this is too good a record to place so low on the 200).  Anyway Robert Been and the guys produced their magnum opus.  \\"Shuffle Your Feet\\", is a great piece of acoustic music, a true classic for me still 6 years on.  \\"Devil's Waitin'\\", is another great song.  The Led Zeppelinish \\"Ain't No Easy Way\\".  The harmonica laced \\"Still Suspicion Holds You\\", right along with \\"Fault line\\".  The churchy \\"Promise\\", with \\"Restless Sinner\\", is yet another fine acoustic number.  The band lets it roll on \\"Gospel Song\\".  The Dylanish word play of \\"Complication Situation\\".  \\"Sympathatic Noose\\" and \\"The Line\\" close out the disc, I couldn't wait for their next release, but \\"Baby '81\\" in (2007), was another let down.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, along with a host of excellent directors and actors, have combined to make a mini-series that is sure to be regarded as one of the best-ever.  Similar to its predecessor \\"Band of Brothers\\", \\"The Pacific\\" takes a look at the war in the Pacific through the eyes of the Marines who fought there.    Three Marines are featured throughout the series: Eugene Sledge (Joseph Mazzello), Robert Leckie (James Badge Dale), and John Basilone (John Seda).  Through the different campaigns fought by these men, the viewer gets a true, authentic, and often horrifying idea of what the war in the Pacific was really like.  Sledge, plagued by a heart murmur, enlisted later than most of his friends, including his long-time buddy Sid Phillips, but he did see action on Pelelieu and Okinawa.  Somewhat introverted and hesitant at first, by the end of the Okinawa campaign, Sledge had turned into an effective killing machine, showing little compassion for the Japanese.  later in life, Sledge wrote \\"With the Old Breed at Pelelieu and Okinawa\\", largely regarded as one of the best narratives of the Pacific war ever written.    Robert Leckie signed up a few weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor.  An aspiring writer, Leckie served on Guadalcanal, Cape Glouster, and Pelelieu before being wounded. While on leave in Australia, he fell in love with a woman named Stella, only to be spurned later by her.  He wrote letters to his neighbor Vera most frequently, and he ended up marrying her.  He also wrote the excellent books \\"Helmet for my Pillow\\" and \\"Strong Men Armed\\".     John Basilone served as a machine gunner on Guadalcanal.  One night in October, 1942, Basilone single-handedly killed upwards of twenty Japanese while facing constant enemy fire.  He also risked his life by running to the rear for more ammo.  For his actions, John was awarded the Medal of Honor.  He was then sent home to participate in a war bond tour.  But, his heart was still with his fellow Marines.  Hemanaged to persuade his superiors to allow him to go back into combat, and he participated in the Battle of Iwo Jima.    Quite simply, this is one of the absolute BEST series I've ever seen.  The acting is top-notch, the battle scenes were painstakingly re-created to provide the utmost in authenticity, and the \\"extras\\" disc provides information on how the series was made, along with mini-biographies of the major participants.  I've read many books about the war in the Pacific and I've seen many movies, too, but few of them compare to the job that this fine series does in describing the Pacific war.  Highly, highly recommended.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|The first song I have ever heard from Megadeth was \\"Promises\\" from their album The World Needs A Hero. That was way back, probably in the year 2002, and I liked it very much. However, it wasn't until five years later that I finally liked another song from the band, which was \\"Prince of Darkness\\" from their controversial album Risk. I didn't really care much about Megadeth's music until the last few months of 2010. The first album I had listened to from start to finish was Youthanasia, and I already fell in love with it. It became one of my favorite thrash albums of all time. Soon, I explored even deeper. The World Needs A Hero and Cryptic Writings were lovingly enjoyable experiences, and now Rust in Peace is yet another album that I openly recommend to metal fans everywhere.<br /><br />This was made before Countdown to Extinction, so the band's more familiar mainstream sound is heard in some occasions. If you know Megadeth, then you'll know that the lyrics range from religion to government to nuclear apocalypse. The best songs on this album are \\"Hangar 18,\\" \\"Lucretia,\\" and \\"Five Magics.\\" Meanwhile, songs like \\"Holy Wars...The Punishment Due,\\" \\"Take No Prisoners,\\" and \\"Tornado of Souls\\" are awe-inspiring and there's no way that any metal fan can dislike them. The only song I [kind of] don't like, however, is \\"Poison was the Cure,\\" but even this song isn't really half bad.<br /><br />Overall, I must say that this is a fine album by Megadeth. Now I can't decide which album should be the next one that I should listen to. Countdown to Extinction or The System Has Failed? I guess I'll have to find out for myself.<br /><br />Grade: 9.3/10
B000J103N4|5.0|As the title of this review states, I found the DVD-Audio surround sound remaster of this masterpiece album to be superb.  I played it on a high-end Onkyo system with 5.1 surround and expensive PSB tower speakers.  Even if you're not familiar with this album, it is worth the money and time investment for the DVD-Audio version; forget MP3 versions.  It is a very distinctive piece from the Sixties era that, in many ways, is a lot different than most other music from that period.  Most of the etherial tunes do not sound dated at all; the bluesy 'Cowboy Movie,' more reflective of the era's music, is a stunning and powerful example of the emotional and physical impact the electric guitar can have in the hands of a maestro -- play this tune very loud.
0307454541|1.0|I have seen this trilogy advertised emensly by amazon, TV, magazines, and pretty much everywhere else I turn my head. When it was selected for a book club I was curious to see what all the fuss was about. Sure you get mildly \\"sucked\\" into the mystery of the story, but for the most part the book was FILLED with brutal rapes, and Blomberg who just passes himself around with handfuls of different women. I tried to read the second book, because I have to finish something I start, and the freaking PROLOUGE was another grotesque, brutal, and unneeded rape scene. The next two chapters are about Lisbeth (who is what -25?) sleeping with a 16 year old. It sickens me that the author was able to create these disgusting rape scences in his mind. I actually returned the second book to the bookstore. I would not reccomend this book to anyone, especially not anyone younger than 18.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book - it's very well-written and a really interesting story. It holds your attention from the first page and is full of intrigue and suspense. It really is a must-read!
1439163146|2.0|James Franco is, by all accounts, a busy guy.  According to his biography, he's an actor, director, artist, and writer; according to a recent magazine article, he is attending classes at three separate graduate schools and has recently been selected to co-host the upcoming Academy Award ceremony.  That's all quite astonishing and worthy of attention, to be sure.  And any artist willing to stretch himself and try something new deserves some acclaim.  Unfortunately, the very best thing that can be said about his debut collection of short stories, \\"Palo Alto,\\" is that it constitutes an admirable attempt.  The execution is shambling, stunted, fumbling for faux-profundity that eludes even its clumsy grasp, an exercise in pointlessness that serves as a fairly damning indictment of whatever graduate writing program Franco used as a training ground for this book, as well as whatever agent and publisher found this material worthy of mass presentation.<br /><br />It's not as though Franco is utterly without talent and can't pull off the occasional interesting image; take the story \\"Tar Baby,\\" and his description of the lonely and empty night: \\"Outside, it was a little cold, and the sound vacuumed out to quiet, nothing but a few cars passing in the distance along Middlefield Road.\\" There are occasional nuggets like this throughout \\"Palo Alto,\\" but the problem is that they add up to nothing.  The predominant theme is disaffected youth, and every story is told from the first person perspective, demonstrating little to no range; Franco's narrators skip from one incident to the next with next to no insight or reflection.<br /><br />Each story is also anticlimactic, choosing simply to end abruptly without resolution.  In a book of fifteen stories, the anti-climax approach can work as an arresting sort of change-up pitch a handful of times, but in every story, it simply becomes tiresome.  Eventually, some of your stories need a payoff, lest they stand as only meaningless sketches, doodles of disaffected youth. If you're going to go with abrupt endings, the material leading up to them needs to be very compelling, enough to let the reader complete the story in their minds; but in Franco's pages, even the most shocking material - a teenager who has a sexual affair with her much-older soccer coach, underage drinking and driving, vehicular homicide, or animal abuse - is all rendered in such a casual, dull, shallow manner that it provokes no profound emotions.  Like a damp matchbook, it's all essentially meaningless.<br /><br />Perhaps that is Franco's point here -- everything is meaningless -- but if so, why bother to capture it?  The more logical conclusion is that Franco, at this point in his writing career, lacks either the interest or the ability to push his writing further.  Maybe in the future he'll write something that matters; \\"Palo Alto\\" does not.ffected youth.

B002ZCY7SW|5.0|I never started the original series when it was on prime time.  My husband and I got the DVD's from my son and have been addicted ever since.  I will never see the government the same way again!  The characters are riviting and the show so fast paced that when one is over, I have to watch another and another and go to bed past my bedtime just to satisfy my curiosity, which, by the way is never satisfied, but that's the fun of it.    My idol is Jack and like others have said, Chloe is awesome and quirky and real.  I love the whole idea of the show and those that say there are repetitions, yes, that's true but the characters are deep and caring (those with the government) and those that are not, watch out!    Get the series and enhance your experience of life.  It will be a good ride!
B001BZRUR4|5.0|I Am The Messenger is an extremely captivating book! This is one of the greatest books I've yet to read.      It tells the story of ordainary Ed, who hasn't done anything special in his entire 19 years of living. But then the first card came and his life changed completely. He changes people's lives while changing his own. It is full of good and bad, or in between. I happened to like the beginning better than the rest of the book, but no book is perfect. This is a beautiful book, because the messeage is &#34;Ordinary people can do Extrordinary things, no matter who they are, if they try&#34;     I highly reccomend this book. It's funny and amazing and it's just plain lovely
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I was very impressed with both the quality & content of this album. Great music for running/workouts. Definitely a great value.
B003NSPUOC|5.0|Shipping was a little long - but it did come from \\"over the pond\\" - so no problem there.  Communication was great and the product was in great condition, as promised.  I was happy with the price I had to pay also - very fair.
0385528752|5.0|So many applications in life, not just business.  I've already started using some of the techniques at home with my husband and kids, unbeknownst to them. I'm doing the same at work.  I'm a technical program manager and getting projects initiated and executed is so difficult. I'm always fighting against scope creep. I'm using this book for a new framework and approach to everything I do at work.  It's my 2011 path to success.<br />I read a lot of non-fiction and this one is EXCELLENT! I highly recommend it. I'm into my second reading right now and taking notes this round.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Lady Gaga is no cookie cutter plastic pop star in the likes that mainstream is so used to seeing. Her image is edgy and the music on this album is heavy brilliant innovative pop with dark lyrics and powerful messages. Wether at a party or a club, one can't ignore how fast dance floors fill when Gaga's songs come on, but the thing that I love the most about these powerful dance floor anthems are the thought process and the meanings behind them.     1. Bad Romance - a song about being in love with your friend and wanting absolutely everything from them, even their ugly and their most deepest darkest part of them that they think nobody else would like, but also about that relationship being in such a state of convolution that ends up being detrimental and feels like they could write a bad romance novel out of it. The way she references Hitchcock movies during the second verse is absolutely genius! Overall a powerful dark dance anthem 10/10     2. Alejandro - This song is about the fear of sex and intimacy. How your past lovers can hurt you and ruin you for anyone that comes after them. That's the dilemma between Gaga and Alejandro, as much as Gaga loves him she just can't be with him because she's afraid to get hurt again. \\"And all those flames that burned before him/ Now he's gotta firefight gotta cool the bad\\" is one of my favorite lines of the song. It explains how Alejandro tries to fight against the resistance she puts up. Overall this is one of my most favorite songs on the album, there are so many addicting layers to and it somewhat reminds me of ABBA and Swedish music which I love! 10/10     3. Monster- One of the most creative and tantric songs on the album, I love how Lady Gaga sounds soulful in some of the harmonies but yet she maintains this dark electronic vibe throughout the song. I would've LOVED to see a music video to this. The song is like nothing she's done before and I'm crazy about the ferocious lyrics! My favorite line is     \\"We French kissed ona subway train, He tore my clothes right off   He ate my heart and then he ate my brain!\\"     One of the most addicting songs on the album!! 10/10     4. Speechless- a 70's inspired rock song Lady Gaga wrote out of desperation for her father and his unwillingness to get heart surgery. The lyrics are close enough though to be considered a heart breaking love song about a relationship gone bad. Lady Gaga sounds powerful and raw in this song. I dedicate it to all my past lovers who've done me wrong! 10/10     5. Dance In The Dark - LADY GAGA'S BEST SONG TO DATE!! \\"Dance In The Dark\\" is a song about insecurities, and how the person you're with can only deepen them and make you feel worse about yourself. It's also an anthem of empowerment cause it talks about breaking free from those inhibitions and restraints. I cannot tell you how many times I have quoted \\"I'm a free Bitch Baby!\\" and how those words empower me to be more of an independent person and not to rely so much on the validation of others to realize my self-worth. The pounding mysterious 80's synthesizers give it this dark Epic New Wave feel that will have you hooked from the very beginning! 10/10     6. Telephone - A hammering club anthem that gets you up and moving! This song just gets better more grandiose everytime i listen to it. There's nothing really significantly deep about this song other than it's about suffocation and wanting to have a good time without the interruptions of technology, which i I can totally relate to! And although this song is incredibly catchy and upbeat I think it was a bad choice for second single, Since \\"Dance In The Dark\\" or \\"Monster\\" would've had a much bigger impact on pop music in the same way that \\"Bad Romance\\" did. 10/10     7. So Happy I Could Die- I LOVE the sound and the hypnotic electronic slowed down tempo of this song. This track is about addiction and how you can be in such a euphoric and happy state with it that you're blinded by it not caring or realizing that it'sbad for you and it could be deadly in the end. She also sings about masturbation and how it can help you through some of the darkest moments of your life when you feel like everything is just falling apart    \\"And in the silence of the Night,  through all the tears and all the lies  I touch myself and it's alright\\"    I smile every time this song comes on, It's incredible!! 10/10     8. Teeth - This is a very eccentric track and it's completely ALL over the place and I LOVE IT!! It's immensly creative, raw and I love her unfettered ranting and how the whole thing sounds tribal and something completely out of this world. A smashing way to end the album and one of my favorite songs 10/10     Lady Gaga is incredibly talented and this album is just completely ground-breaking! Putting out this type of dynamic material soley a year and a half into her career leaves me in complete anticipation to see her more in the future!! She is the true definition of an Entertainer and an Artist    My Top 5   1. Alejandro  2. Bad Romance  3. Dance In The Dark  4. So Happy I Could Die  5. Teeth
B0043A0PXU|5.0|There was little advertisement about this CD, but the choice of songs and arrangements are beautiful, and it has the potential to become a very popular album.  Annie does a wonderful job of enhancing some classic carols, and she has two of her own new songs that are both very touching.  I highly recommend this CD.  Set aside some quiet time on Christmas Eve to listen to A Christmas Cornucopia, and your Christmas season will be much richer because of it!
B000ETQR3Q|5.0|I bought two Longshots at wal-mart for $15 each on black friday, and let me tell you. They are amazing. The scope is useless, it just looks cool. The pistol on the end is useless as well, having it on just decreases the range of the longshot. The pistols themselves suck also, the farthest mine has ever gone was 15 feet. It usually goes about 2 feet.     The Longshot is great, mine goes about 35 feet. It's pretty light, and the stock is really comfortable. I like how the stock holds a clip. The bipod is kinda cool.    If you are going to mod it, there are two pathways you can take, or do a combination. The two pathways are Assault rifle, and Sniper rifle. Modding it is essential to get full potential. I rated it's educational value as 4 stars because you can learn a lot from modding it.     If you want it as an assault rifle, your best bet is to put a more powerful spring where the original one is, put a more powerful catch spring in (this keeps it from misfiring), putting a piece of PVC pipe in the stock to keep it from collapsing on your hand, taking out the air restrictor, taking out the locks, and doing the front gun integration. The front gun integration is where you saw out the bipod, and put the front gun there and linking the triggers. Check out nerfhaven.com or Coop772's youtube channel for instructions.     If you want a sniper, you should again do the same spring upgrades and take out the air restrictor and locks. Instead of doing the FG integration, you should keep the bipod. There are a couple little nubs that keep the bipod from going any farther than it can go, so saw those out and your bipod will be more practical. You should also take the barrel and the piece that locks the FG into the Longshot out of the FG, and glue them together for a better sniper look. Again, check nerfhaven and youtube.    Overall this is a great nerf gun. I would recommend it to any nerfer.    Pros:  Large range  feel of a sniper  stock holds a clip  bipod  pretty light, muchlighter than the Stampede    Cons:  Front gun is crappy, it just slows down the dart  the scope sucks  if you upgrade the spring power, when your cocking the stock might collapse on your hand, and that really hurts.  TOO EXPENSIVE!!!    If you can find a deal where it's less than $50, buy it. Or if you have nothing to do with your money.    I recommend it to all nerfers from age 8 to 48. yes, I know a 48 year old nerfer.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What a delightful read.  I cannot remember the last time I stayed up into the wee hours, skipped work to sneak in a read, and was captivated by a books story.  I was hesitant because of the characterization of science fiction.  If that bothers you, please read this book.   I am so glad I jumped past that, and trusted all the positive reviews.
B0002S943O|4.0|I have rediscovered DM and this is my second concert film. Dave's voice is great but I agree w/the previous poster who said the video was dark and strange.  Although Dave seems giddy, you know something is not quite right.  And if you know the band you know what it is.  It makes me sad actually.  If I could hear the video w/out watching it might be best.<br /> I can only contrast this video w/ Barcelona 2009 video, which is much lighter. It is  great to watch bc not only is the song selection awesome but  it looks  like Dave and Martin are genuinely  having a good time.  Dave's voice is not as strong as in Devotional but it still pretty damn good.<br />I gave it four stars bc the singing is quite good and DM can almost do no wrong, but the experience made me depressed and not in a good way ;)
B002K0WBXW|3.0|I give three stars when I buy a film--this is also a three star film (which is not to be confused with a Michelin 3 star Restaurant, or fine cinema).  Some films I bought are 2 star ventures, but I liked them anyway.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock plays one of the most uptight characters I've ever seen in a movie.  That she moves naturally in her restrictive wardrobe is impressive, although it seems that she has a bustle, but of course it's only Sandra Bullock in passing.  Well, it's a nice view either way.  Clearly, I like chick flicks, and this is a good chick flick.<br /><br />It's about the NYC book publishing scene, and a determined female editor who gets things done, but who, for some reason, can't seem to get herself straight with the INS (she's Canadian).  So, like a lot of immigrants these days, she faces deportation, until she decides her rather overly cooperative executive secretary will marry her.  And he goes along with it, until a visit to the INS office ends up with them taking a trip to Sitka, Alaska, for his grandmother's 90th birthday.  Among the glaciers, the spark of romance is lit.<br /><br />If I had a problem with this film, it was with the class angle.  She thinks he's poor, and then she finds he's not, and suddenly, he's not so bad.  It's not the movie's fault, it's our ever more stratified society, but I found that aspect rather unappealing.  Otherwise, as light and fluffy entertainment, this film delivers quite nicely.  \\"The Proposal\\" moves rather briskly, with some side trips along the way, but delivers a nice and pleasant diversion from whatever it is you wanted diversion from.
B000F4RHB6|4.0|Positives: remastered sound is excellent; contains a full version of \\"Small World; \\"Back in Time\\",\\"Hip to be square\\" and \\"Couple o'days off\\" tracks are included  Negatives: cruisin' duet with Gwenneth Paltrow(why this is on here-its the worst song), the tracks \\"Bad is Bad\\",\\"Sooner or Later(will you say I love you)\\" and \\"Walking on a Thin Line\\" have been left off.    Overall this is a just revamped & remastered version of \\"The Heart of rock & Roll-The Best of Huey Lewis\\" and the News(1992 release). Excellent collection overall from Huey and the boys.
0743277708|5.0|Richard Adams states rather casually in the introduction to this 2005 edition that \\"Watership Down was never intended to be some sort of allegory or parable.  It is simply the story about rabbits made up and told in the car.\\"  Well, that must have been some drive, because students of the book have been expositing upon its non-allegories since it was first published in 1972.    For instance; the final self-sacrifice of the mythical El-ahrairah to save his people; or Fiver the prophet of doom; or the character of the Black Rabbit; or the terrible rise of Woundwort.  These may be unintentionally similar to historical or biblical characters, or merely representative of the subconscious imagination of a man who had survived WWII.  A man who now lived under the shadow of communism, the cold war, Vietnam and jolly ol' England's slide into Socialism following the ruins of empire.    What I find preposterous is the idea that the various rabbit warrens portrayed were not allegories of some sort, particularly Cowslip's (Shining Wire) Warren and Woundwart's Efrafa Warren.  These two warrens symbolized the quote attributed to Benjamin Franklin; \\"Those who would trade liberty for security deserve neither.\\"  Both warrens were unnatural, with the first being a total sacrifice of the traditional ways of the wild rabbit for the security from want.  The second being a total sacrifice of freedom for the security from danger.    What these warrens achieved in their fictional realities were reflective of the shadows that Mr. Adams himself lived under at the time.  The easier of the two to understand is the police state of Efrafa Warren, representative of the Fascist states brought to rubble in the war, and the looming Communist behemoth of the Soviet Union and its Eastern European vassals.  The much harder to understand is the Shining Wire state of Cowslip's Warren, with its generations gone of lost traditions and its embrace of death.    Cowslip's Warren is the much more frightening ofthe two because it wasn't representative of the \\"other,\\" as the Soviet Union was to the people of England in 1972.  The Shining Wire Warren, with its promise of unwilling sacrifice, loss of culture, destruction of history and turning away from religion; that was the state of \\"becoming.\\"    Whether Adams knew it or not, the Shining Wire Warren was a foreshadowing of what England was becoming.  What England is today, and how much more England will be in the future.    In the human condition, freedom from want requires unwilling sacrifices that rob a culture of its very soul.  For instance, the unwilling sacrifice of the elderly due to the expense of medical procedures.  The unwilling sacrifice of history, culture and worship that are stolen from the young due to political correctness.  Unwilling sacrifice leads to unparalleled selfishness.  The only thing these people refuse to sacrifice, once all that had made them a great people is lost on the altar of Socialist Utopian theory, is the belief in the lie that there can be security from want.
B0020BUWX2|2.0|With all the deeper YA novels out there this falls short. Good premise but it seemed a better read in lovely bones where the 'pergatory' topic was discussed. Just not dimensional enough. Would make a nice, higher end lifetime movie or afterschool special but look elsewhere for a more challenging, emotional story. YA is so tricky when you read it as a genre as an adult and expect an adult novel. This would be a great read for a tween or teen. I don't worry over a PPs concern of the characters parents being overly permissive. This book did not seem to glorify teen sex and appeared to show it in almost an afterthought-like manner. If you want teen lit with no sexual tenision then buy your teen a drivers ed manual. Even mormon writer Steph Meyers of Twilight fame has permissive parents to spare. It wouldnt be teen lit w/o extraordinary teen freedom in it. As a forner resident of teen-ville I can assure that reading about a literary characters sex life and safe sex-aware parents would not have caused me to run out and buy condoms and shag my prom date.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|i was thinking it was going to be no where close to Percy Jackson. But I think you have to read the Percy Jackson series before this book.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|Not your typical \\"ballet\\" movie. This was more like Single White Female meets Psycho. You do not need to be a fan of the ballet to see this movie, Black Swan is a thrilling tale of what happens when one becomes obsessed with being perfect. It is well deserved of at least one Oscar nod and Natalie Portman is at her finest.<br /><br />(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

B000005JA8|4.0|I thought \\"Shotgun Method\\" wrote a very good and thoughtful review, and I note that he/she state that if they \\"could change the rating\\" they would \\"give it two\\" [stars] rather than one.  The point about avante-garde art and music such as this is that it creates such strong SUBJECTIVE responses (visceral and emotional) in the viewer/listener, that careful OBJECTIVE critiques (how well does the artist achieve their goals and how well-executed is the art [as measured by accepted standards within its category]) are harder to come by.  Atonal and dissonant music such as Beefheart is truly \\"difficult\\", but so is music by Stockhausen or Ligeti, Coltrane or Sun Ra, or even Hendrix or The Grateful Dead. I think listeners give low ratings to Trout Mask based more on simply \\"not liking it\\", rather than being qualified musical critics giving an objective analysis of avante-garde music.
B003CN5SAY|1.0|What a disappointment; bad scripts, bad acting (except Vanessa Redgrave), poor direction - but with those scripts, no wonder! - flat and boring.  The unbelievability of the 'plots' is an insult to the viewer.  What was a fun series has turned in to dull, monotonous, characterless and vapid waste of time; could do well as a US daytime soap.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
B003EYVXSW|5.0|All 5 stars!  Very unique and imaginative production.  I don't think I've seen a more creepy alien.  If you're a sc-fi fan, don't miss this one.
0671027344|5.0|When i read the first letter (the book is told in a series of letters to an undisclosed person) I thought that the book was good enough to keep reading. It was not until the second or third letter that i realized that this was one of the best books i had ever read. After that, the book was a emotional journey through Charlie's honest, kind, understanding, jubilant, depressed, thoughtful, and smitten mind. The book tackles the realties of high school (and life) head on. Charlie does not beat around the bush in his expressive, truthful, and cutting letters. Charlie's poignant observations about the way he, and other people act hits you where it matters. You will come away from this book changed for the better. Charlie is supposed to be on the brink of adulthood, but has wisdom far beyond his years. This is by far one of the best books that i have ever read in my life. (Mrs. Castle A5 SOA)  D.G.
1599218011|5.0|I have read MANY books about health and nutrition and Kris Carr's new book is the best yet!  She combines EVERYTHING that I have learned in all the resources I have been studying into an easy to read book that is filled with information, suggestions, and humor to make you laugh.  Whether you are trying to recover from an illness or you are trying to stay healthy, Crazy Sexy Diet is the book to add to your collection.
B003XUKVXK|5.0|This is an incredible offering from KWS. The recording is immaculate, actually better than his studio recordings. But the game is on, I suppose, for locating a hard copy CD of the deluxe edition that has additional tracks, including a 10 minute rendition of Voodoo Chile. I saw Kenny do this live a few years back and was absolutely blown away.  So where is it? Who has the CD for purchase? Is it only an MP3 download? Can't find it anywhere online! Why the marketing game? Why not make the special edition available on a CD for purchase instead of ONLY the MP3 download? Aggravating!
B001GCUO5M|2.0|Despite the clever casting,  the \\"trick\\" to this movie is obvious almost from the very beginning.  Once you see the illusion being created,  the characters are stereotypical and really uninteresting.   If the writing has been a lot more clever and intelligent,  the plot of the movie wouldn't have been so obvious and perhaps held my attention a bit longer,  but at a fundamental level the characters have nothing new to tell us nor do they shed any new light on the kind of evil that exists in the world.
0440244870|4.0|Fun, fun, fun book! This story was super fun to read and I instantly wanted more. Becky Bloomwood manages to finagle out of everything and I sometimes wondered who would really do that, but she is a wildly creative character. She manages to keep people on thier toes with her 'excuses' as to why they should help her out. As much as I wanted to be impatient towards Rebecca, I couldn't help cheering for her and admiring her for being so creative.     Some people have said this book/ plot line/ main character were ridiculous but the intent behind creating this story I think was more for entertainment than a completely rational story or a main character that is responsible and thinks through all of her decisions. This is fiction that is not meant to be an example of what to do or not to do, so once I kept that in mind I no longer put a whole lot of thought into how she got all the lines of credit in the first place and how bad her credit must be.     I enjoyed the messes that follow her around and continued reading to see how she rationalizes away reality but not in a malicious way. Some of her antics were just that and a few times I decided that she made some stupid moves but this was a quick light read. It is always nice to read some books that don't require your complete focus and full attention and this is one of those. Best for reading on the beach, poolside, or while waiting because of how easy it is to just pick it back up again and keep reading.    Enjoy the ride!
B004DK5CYM|5.0|This is a great film for everyone, especially if you lived at the time of SECRETARIAT.  This was the first movie I have seen in about 2 years, and the first in a long time that I was excited about and truly wanted to see.  In 1973, Secretariat touched everyone in this country.  Just about everyone was talking about and rooting for this horse.  But, in addition to telling the story of a champion Triple Crown winning horse, this film tells the story of just how implausible the events behind the champion were.  While taking a few moments of dramatic license, it effectively tells the story of the background of this thoroughbred legend as was brilliantly laid out by William Nack, in SECRETARIAT, THE MAKING OF A CHAMPION.  I have heard about and read reviews that this was more Penny's story than Secretariat's story, maybe so, but the truth is, without Penny, there would be no Secretariat.  This is no different than SEABISCUIT, which was as much the story of the three individuals who brought immortality to that horse as well.  In short, this is a must see film, and is thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable.  For once you can see a movie and feel good about what you have seen; the story of a horse with a tremendous heart nurtured on by people with the heart to believe.  HE IS MOVING LIKE A TREMENDOUS MACHINE,(from Chic Anderson's immortal call during the Belmont Stakes).
B0040UAYI4|1.0|I have tried it with 4 different keyboards: MS natural, ViewSonic, Acer, and a zboard regular, and it did not work on any of them. I even tried redoing the setup 3-4 times on each using the keyboard 1 and keyboard 2 option. It didn't make a difference.  PS3 would recognize the keyboards plugged in directly to it, but not through the Eagle Eye.
1439181780|5.0|This may sound corny and grandiose, but this is the book I've been looking for my entire life. It's not fancy or complicated or worst of all pretentious, pseudo intellectual. It simply tells you how to do it. How to create your life the way you want it. I never order workbooks or `extra' stuff that go with books, but this time I also bought the journal and it has really helped me stay on it. It has great inspiring quips. Any notebook will do though. I honestly am a much happier person than I was two months ago. I have given this book to eight people so far.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|Do not pay attention to the many critics that have unfairly panned this movie.  My question for them are:  What were you expecting, exactly?  I firmly believe that many critics gave this film poor reviews because of their wunderlust for James Cameron and Avatar.  How anybody could believe that Avatar is an immensely greater film than TRON:  Legacy is absolutely ridiculous.    The visuals and music make this a must-see experience to behold on the big screen.  If you must wait for the DVD or Blu-Ray, I highly suggest watching it within the confines of surround sound.  Not doing so will greatly diminish the intended viewing experience and may actually detract from your enjoyment.
B00005JMUA|5.0|If, in 'Volume 1', Quentin Tarantino made one of the best movies for people who love Japanese grindhouse, then in 'Volume 2' he made one of the best movies for people who love movies. Tarantino is just about the most unerring director I've seen. He has never made a film that was less than Very Good, and 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' is the greatest of all his films to date. This isn't a sequel to 'Vol. 1', as he didn't decide to split 'Kill Bill' up until just after he finished shooting, it's simply the second half. 'Vol. 1' is an excellent, excellent film, but no where in the range of this one. I grin ear-to-ear all the way through this movie.<br /><br />This is Quentin's most visually beautiful movie yet (and the magnificent opening chapter in the chapel, shot in gleaming black-and-white, is profoundly resplendent, as is the great sequence at Pai Mei's ancient abode, shot in gloriously seventies-style over-saturated greens and glaring whites), and it's where his flair for spaghetti-Westerns comes out the most; the majority of the movie is vintage Wild West. As in all of Tarantino's films, the dialogue is an unadulterated joy, and there's actually relatively little of it here, nearly all of it spoken slowly and ponderously, much of it philosophically, as befits a movie with this Western setting. The way the characters each savor and weigh their words is one of the best aspects of the film; Quentin has never written dialogue as lastingly satisfying as this.<br /><br />In a beautiful scene that grins at us with delight (as is Tarantino's wont), the Bride tracks down a father-figure of Bill's to learn his location, and he tells her a story about taking him to a movie as a little boy, at which he learned what type of women Bill 'was a fool for', even at that age. We learn from this brief story the fancy Bill always had that first attracted him to the Bride long before the 'Kill Bill' story began. Where so many movies would give us a disturbing childhood story explaining how the villain became that way, Quentin gives us one about a likable, positive trait that reminds us of his humanity, just before our heroine confronts him.<br /><br />'Vol. 2' is nearly his least violent film yet, and I've read both the original script and David Carradine's 'The Kill Bill Diaries', about all he saw of the making of the movies, and it's clear that many of Quentin's best decisions had to do with diminishing or removing the action. In place of the more obvious strategy of showing us a detailed sequence of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad gruesomely gunning down the people in the chapel, he decided no, pull back and let us just listen to a brief event from a distance, observing it in a kind of silhouette. And in place of Bill firing a warning shot at the Bride and holding her at gun-point while she walks towards a couch to seat herself, he decided Bill simply regards her casually, his pistol just visible at his waist, of which they are both aware. In the earlier idea, all suspense would have been spent with the warning shot. When Bill relates the tale of Pai Mei to the Bride, he decided it would be more effective to let us use our imaginations while listening to Bill's ponderous speech by the camp-fire in the dark than to play seventies Kung Fu footage of Pai Mei in action over the monologue.<br /><br />The first time I saw the movie, the first big thing that struck me was Budd, one of the Bride's three remaining targets. His is a great and tragic character, and Michael Madsen is a great actor. His performance begins in a singularly perfect scene with Carradine which shows us his indifference to, and acceptance of, his approaching probable demise. And for a long stretch the Bride is forgotten, and we simply follow Budd into the lonely strip club he tends bar at, getting a taste of what his existence has become, of his disappointment and withdrawal from life (the scene where he argues with his boss Larry and finally relinquishes both his hat and his pride is worthy of applause). Every time I watch the scene of the Bride's sneak-attack on him, I am more amazed by how exquisitely constructed the whole sequence is. A long, meticulous build-up ending in unexpected truncation is a trade-mark of Quentin's, in activity as well as dialogue. What Budd does with the Bride is endlessly fascinating to me in its brilliant, terrifying, primeval simplicity. This is the stuff of great myths.<br /><br />A while ago I realized I can't truly cherish movies, even great ones, that zip right along, whose scenes each seem to exist mostly to set the next scene up. 'Vol. 2', and for that matter, all of Quentin's movies, allow us to inhabit its scenes' settings, their situations, their characters, their moods. The scenes in this movie are each genuine, distinct places to me. Discussing his 'Jackie Brown', Tarantino said that for a film to last beyond its theatrical run, its scenes need to have substance in themselves and can't only be about that specific film's plot, as you pretty much get that the first time around. He said people often wonder why 'Jackie' has so many 'hang-around' scenes, in which the characters just hang around and talk to each other - scenes about the characters, about great dialogue. He believes those are crucial in bringing people back to a film for the sixth, the seventh, the fiftieth times. What happens when Elle visits Budd when all seems to be finished? They hang out for a while. What basically happens for most of the Bride's stay at Bill's residence? They hang out.<br /><br />In the last chapter the tone of the film changes from the grandiose, Tarantinian adventure of the first four chapters - in which almost godlike characters imprison, and barter, and betray, and apprentice, and battle each other, and do great deeds, and in which much depends on who possesses the Bride's unequalled Hanzo sword - and settles into an intimate dialogue between the story's two central characters (and one other, for a time), in which Quentin subtly and expertly simmers the tension and danger that exists between these two supremely deadly assassins. This section of the film is in keeping with an other trade-mark of Quentin's, that of inserting elements of simplest, uttermost reality into an over-the-top, epic story. With Quentin's help, David Carradine produced a deliriously great performance in this film, as a man who is possibly even more laid-back than Carradine was himself, but who can be deeply, genuinely menacing. In the last chapter, he delivers two of the movie's best speeches, one about the death of a goldfish, the other about his favorite superhero.<br /><br />'Kill Bill Vol. 2' is the most joyful, the most exciting, the most glorious celebration of the cinema I've ever seen. It is Tarantino's deepest and most emotionally powerful film by far (and the often over-looked sequence of the Bride slowly preparing herself before leaving a bed-room to face Bill is one of the very best in the film) and during an autoexcavation it has one of the very best uses of music I've heard in a movie. The climax of the Bride's raggedly magnificent confrontation with her wicked rival Elle evokes in me the emotion of sheer love. And the scene of the Bride's triumph over the designs of Budd has become one of my central images of the cinema. This film is a human object and it radiates its director's signature passion and love of the movies. Roger Ebert once said that 'The Third Man' is 'the film that most perfectly embodies the romance of going to the movies', or it is for him at least. For me, it's this one.
0143038583|5.0|Fascinating book! Between this book and the author's movie, \\"Food, Inc\\",   I've completely eliminated 4-legged animals from my diet, and I'm happier  and healthier because of it.
B0000028M7|5.0|Quite a few years ago I had about 70 of my CDs stolen. This was one of them. In a world where I could have easily purchased the songs digitally, downloaded them free through some obscure Russian FTP site, or just lived with the crappy old lossy MP3 versions I had on a hard drive, I've chosen not to do so. I bought it again; it's just that good. Is there anything else that needs to be said? Didn't think so...
6305841861|1.0|Movie opens with a guy who finds some tape recorder type thing. You think this is going to be good. Kinda creepy. Not long after he finds this tape recorder and listens to this tape about evil spirits - soon some evil force comes along and goes through the woods and starts to possess people... so I think.<br /><br />Lame from the get go. Right after he finds this tape it goes downhill. Horribly cheesy special effects, very unscary and not at all funny. Completely devoid of any redeeming value.<br /><br />I heard this was a \\" re-make\\", why remake something this crappy to begin with? The whole movie was bad and the end was even more stupid. The special effects were bad, the demons at the end were not scary or funny. Just plain lame. - Bad actors and bad acting.<br /><br />Don't get all the positive reviews. Who would like this movie other than an 11 year old boy? If you find this funny then you must not be funny or it tells me something about comedy, how rare it is and how people will laugh at anything cause its so hard to come by.<br /><br />If you like stupid, go ahead and see it. If a man eating his own hand entertains you and cheesy fake demons go see it.<br /><br />Horror fan, yes. lover of comedy horror, sure, but not this.

0307341542|5.0|I just finshed this novel last night. What can I say that no one else has said already, except that I grew up in that house. The author brings out the Camille Preaker in every woman who was not Mama's favorite child. I did not cut myself, yet my scars are as visible to me as Camille's are to the world. Each child in an emotionally brittle and fragile household has their own version of Camille's story to tell. Everyone becomes ill in a home like hers. Children of fractured mothers act out in unique ways. Some cut themsleves to relieve the enormous pressure of just living under constant guard. The need to keep things \\"pretty\\" exceeds all, even the beat of one's heart. Some try to appease by excelling at school or in the public eye, or by remaking themselves into a wild creature who flouts the iron clad boundaries of home and hearth. No one escapes fully alive. The best one can do is salvage.  I applaud this book. The portrait it paints is a true one.

B003YDXCZU|5.0|Every now and then a book comes out that sheds new light on an old issue.  Back of the Napkin is such a book because it provides a new way of approaching problems.  Roam explains how the way we physically see can translate into creative thinking.  For example, he explains how the basic process of seeing - looking, seeing, imagining and showing - converts easily to problem solving: observing the situation at a very raw level (looking); seeing patterns, relationships, etc, in the information that start us thinking (seeing); imagining ways in which what we learned by seeing can help our problem (imagining); and, finally, demonstrating to ourselves or others how these ideas will work or what our findings mean (showing). Combining this with the hand-eye coordination involved in drawing simple pictures triggers creative inspiration.  Roam also shows how, when we look at something or imagine something, we are, roughly in this sequence, looking at who/what, how much/many, where, when and why.  These ways of seeing fit neatly into the way problems break down.  They also apply to each of the ways that information can be presented.  A where problem, for example, can be depicted in a map; a how issue can be drawn in a flow chart.  These can be combined to reflect more complicated relationships, if necessary.  And, for each of these six ways of seeing, there are 5 options in how your picture is drawn (thought they may not apply fully to each way of seeing).  Here he introduces the SQVID, which is an acronym for the 5 scales, so to speak, which can be used: S - Simple or Complex; Q: Qualitative or Quantitative; V - Vision or Execution; I - Individual or Comparison; and D - Change (Delta) or Status Quo.  So for example, you can draw an execution flow chart that shows the status quo, or you can draw a vision flow chart for the future, and each can be drawn at a high level (simple) or at a very detailed level (complex).  Bringing all these visual thinking components together - the seeing process, the six ways of seeing, the five ranges of presentation, stimulate both right and left brain thinking and thus bring out better ideas.    When I switched to another book while reading this one, I noticed myself thinking in pictures, and absorbing the material more deeply.  I am looking forward to re-reading this book again to fully grasp all the concepts, and to begin applying the steps.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I read a lot of the reviews for 30-Day Shred before I actually purchased this video, and I have to say - SO many people were right when they said this was tough! I haven't sweated this much in a long time. I do think that anyone can do this video, no matter if you're overweight and out of shape or in peak physical condition. You can modify a lot of the moves, which I have chosen to do myself to start out. I'm pretty out of shape and am trying to lose a considerable amount of weight, and I'm excited to have added this video to my workout routine. I started off without weights and am slowly adding in light weights. I'll update again in about a month or so in regards to my weight loss, but I am very optimistic and am so glad that this video exists! It is perfect for people who have little time or money, and the workouts are ideal for anyone trying to improve their bodies, regardless of their physical capabilities.    --UPDATE--    January 12, 2011    I've been using the Shred for about a week now and have lost 4 lbs.! I started out doing it every other day, but over the past three days I felt like I should try doing it back to back and I've been keeping up with that. I don't get as sore as I initially did when I first started, but this work-out still gets me sweating and boosts my heart rate. Next week I will try to alternate the Shred with Banish Fat Boost Metabolism and see how that works for me. I'll update again in about a week!    --UPDATE--    February 2, 2011    After that initial first week, my weight loss slowed down a bit - BUT, I continued to get stronger and my clothes are still getting looser. I lost 10 lbs. total over the past month, which I'm pretty happy about. I am moving at a much slower pace compared to most people on here and actually took a break for an entire week because I got sick. Fortunately, I'm well again and am back on track! I switch back and forth between levels 1 & 2 and feel like that's worked much better for me compared to doing just one level at a time. I'll update again next month!
B001RTP3Z0|4.0|I'm viewing this as I write.  It looks and sounds great.  The little blurb on the inside page begins \\"...tour these shores for the first time...\\". I seem to be missing what came before this.  Anyone else find this to be the case with their booklet?
0060531053|5.0|This book was a Christmsa gift for my brother in law. He loved it. It's great for the budding home brewer.
B003G4W49C|5.0|At first I was somewhat wary of a book where the main character was as young as Ender, but from the first few pages you know that he doesn't think like a regular child, and is probably much smarter than the reader.  His thoughts and the way he approached problems created a very interesting read, and Ender turned out to be very likable.      The trials that ender is constantly going through keep things tense, and along with Card's easy to read writing style made sure I never wanted to put the book down.
0545123275|1.0|Clearly I am not getting what everyone else loves about this book. Incredibly surprised by the positive reviews. Pretty sure it was meant only for pre-teens by the subject matter and style of writing. For an adult, the writing is beyond simplistic. The relationship between the two characters is boring and struggles to go somewhere. His personality is flat; she has odd moments of being a tease and overly-flirtatious. The story dwells on the same thoughts, moments- over and over. This is a lame, pared down version of the Twilight series and seems to rip off some ideas. Wish I could say one positive thing, but no.
B00275EHJG|4.0|This is a very good movie.  I laughed and cried and just loved it.  I must say though, it is not for young children as it is a bit scary in places mean spirited a bit.  I hope they don't make anymore Toy Story movies as I feel this is a wonderful way to end the series.
0316069485|4.0|In \\"The Reversal\\", Michael Connolly pairs long time favorite Harry Bosch with Mickey Haller, the newly created Defense Attorney hero of his recent books. I'm not a big fan of pairing strong series characters...I feel that each character brings their own mood and sense of place and tone to a story; pairing two larger than life characters diminishs them both. As a long time fan of Harry Bosch, I found the shifting focus to be a distraction; moving from Bosch to Haller and back was disconcerting. There is also an immediate problem here with voice. Bosch is a fully realized character with an intricate back story. When he is on stage, you know it. Haller, on the other hand, is a straight forward narrator with little color...for me, he cannot carry a story with Bosch; he is essentially a voice over. Interestingly enough, this is not the case in The Lincoln Lawyer, Haller's first outing. Without Bosch in the story, Haller holds his own.<br /><br />I am a long time fan of police procedurals, having cut my teeth on Ed McBain's classic 87th Precinct series decades ago. Then someone pointed me to John D. MacDonald and Travis McGee...21 books later, I had found Matt Scudder, PI, and I devoured the series. More recently, Robert Bloch's Keller (\\"Hit Man\\") and Lee Child kept me busy, then Robert Crais's Elvis Cole and Joe Pike. Of all of them, Harry Bosch has given me the most pleasure. The mundane details of the \\"murder book\\", the logs, the Detective Grades, all of the minor details of police life fascinated me, long before DNA and \\"CSI\\". Through Harry Bosch, I have learned a lot about the politics and sructure of the LAPD, and celebrated when Harry finally made the elite RHD team at Parker Center.<br /><br />As for this outing, I found the plot to be interesting, engaging, and easy to follow, although I would have rather seen the action through Bosch's eyes only. I also would have liked to have had the benefit of Bosch's personal observations of Mickey Haller. Oh well, maybe next time!
B003XMUFGQ|1.0|This is embarrassing. A talented guitarist phones in an absolute listless effort. It can't be possible he just needs money. There is no soul here at all. Why bother? Why should I bother to listen to this ? \\"Autumn Leaves\\", \\" How Deep is the Ocean\\" and \\"Rocking Chair\\"- all great standards are butchered. Then suddenly, we get blues... but it sounds empty and vacuous. I think Eric Clapton should pack up his old guitar and retire to the Caribbean and spare onetime admirers from having to listen to this. Unless of course it is cocktail hour in a nursing home in Vegas.
B000B589JI|4.0|It is excactly what its supposed to be, holds some extra fluid in case you run out while your out and about, has a tool for removing the flint cover and has a holder for extra flint.<br />I made sure to tighten the caps down and have had no problems with leaking.

1599218011|5.0|This is a fabulous book.  I am neither a vegetarian nor a vegan, but this book makes me think twice about my lifestyle choices.  I love the casual tone of the writing.  Kris really breaks down many aspects of an alkaline plant-based diet, from pH imbalance to taking good care of your endocrine system.  Since reading this book, I have started juicing (which makes me feel great) and have begun eliminating dairy from my diet.  I'm on the path to becoming a new & improved version of me!
B000OIZUW6|5.0|I have read almost all of his books and found that this story captured my attention from chapter one and I could not put it down.  I would recommend it for any fan of his writing but also for anyone looking at reading a good historical fiction about a team of women who come together to influnce the direction of a war. Great read.
B000X1BPYQ|5.0|this album is my favorite album i own. it has just the right mixture of heaviness and melody and the choir is simply amazing.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is a movie for all ages.  I love it, as well as my 17 year old son, and 4 year old daughter.  This is a movie I can watch over and over again.  My son liked it so much that he watched it twice in a row when we first received it.  Then the next day he watched it again with his father.  I've never seen him watch a movie twice in a row, so that is saying something.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|A wonderful addition to my Christmas music collection. I particularly enjoyed the song in which MAriah's mother sang with her.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|A beautiful restoration of a beautiful film.<br /><br />This latest incarnation of The Sound of Music offers the best-ever presentation of the best R&H film adaptation, and one of the great film musicals of all time. The opening shots of the Austrian countryside have never looked more grand, and the outstanding lossless audio track presents the music in its full splendor, sounding every bit like a new movie and not a 40+ year old film.<br /><br />Robert Wise's choice of color palette for this film was rather muted, so there aren't really a lot of bright colors to show off, but the darks are superb (\\"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\\" is lovely) and the moonlit scenes on the Von Trapp veranda are just gorgeous now. This is without doubt the best this film has ever looked and sounded.<br /><br />Many of the special features from previous DVD releases have been incorporated into the blu-ray, but not all. Specifically, owners of the \\"Five Star Collection\\" should hang onto that edition (for the Charmain Carr documentary, among other features). I didn't bother with the deluxe box set (which features the \\"My Favorite Things\\" box; seemed a little too cliche), but no doubt true Sound of Music obsessives will want that edition as well.<br /><br />Very few musical films achieve both the artistic and cultural significance of The Sound of Music, and Fox has done themselves proud with this latest upgrade of one of the jewels in their crown.
B004289ZW0|1.0|I was extremely disappointed to find that my GNS 5870 did not work when it arrived.  The unit employs a \\"touch-swipe\\" on-off switch which requires the user to run his/her finger over the LED screen in order to turn it on and off.  However, the unit required several dozen swipes to turn off, and will not turn back on no matter how many times I swipe it.    Contacting the manufacturer, I was advised that I must send the unit back to a service center for a firmware update.    I am disappointed on three dimensions: 1.) in the design of the product, which represents a triumph of design sizzle over functionality: what genius decided that a fancy swipe mechanism was better than a just-plain on-off switch to power the unit? 2.) that a brand-new unit was shipped directly from the manufacturer without current firmware; and 3.) the firmware is not easily updatable directly through the USB port (though since the unit won't turn on, I won't protest too loudly about this).    I'm excited about the functionality of this unit as a supplement to ForeFlight on my iPad in an airplane cockpit.  But the actual arrival of the device was a big letdown.
B000002JSP|4.0|Led Zeppelin's final studio album is in many ways in a class by itself; the only one that makes use of synthesizers as its base sound, the only one recorded in Sweden (at ABBA's famed Polar Studios); and the only one with bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones clearly in charge of the music.<br /><br />What's remarkable about this record is that despite the extensive use of synthesizers, the album is still so very heavy. \\"Carouselambra\\", the epic 10+ minute track at the album's center, is as loud as anything on 'Physical Graffiti', \\"All My Love\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\" both achieve epic sweep and grandeur; and even the countryfied \\"Hot Dog\\" and piano-centric \\"South Bound Saurez\\" rock like few other bands can manage. Only \\"In the Evening\\" retains the classic Zeppelin cronch, while \\"Fool in the Rain\\" takes off for Brazilian destinations never before seen in the world of hard rock.<br /><br />Perhaps it was nigh impossible for Zeppelin to not be loud, or (more likely) they simply found a way to incorporate the (then new) world of synthesizers into their sound without compromising their hard rock cred. Even with very few guitar riffs (only \\"In the Evening\\" contains any of substance), the music manages to be both heavy and yet full of variety and substance.<br /><br />Largely the work of Robert Plant and John Paul Jones (Page and Bonham were absent for many of the sessions due to addiction issues, although the work they contributed is exemplary), the music on 'In Through the Out Door' seemed to indicate a new musical direction for the band, a direction that alas was not to be explored further.<br /><br />Although not one of their bigger selling albums (and certainly under-appreciated since its release), and although nothing can equal their early albums, 'In Through the Out Door' is still classic Zeppelin in every meaningful sense, showing yet another side of this multifaceted and exceptionally talented band.
B001O2S7XA|5.0|As a father of six boys, we've had a number of Hot Wheels sets over the years.  Most often, they were too complex (and fragile) to handle repeated use without exceptional care.  Our six-year-old son is the latest who's been enamored of these sets, so we picked this one up for him after finding it on sale at a local retail store.<br /><br />It's Simple, and That's Good<br />----------------------------<br />The simplicity of this set really impressed me.  Unlike some sets that had tons of smaller parts, this one has fewer, and those it does have seem to stay attached quite well.  Some of the sets we had before would become marginal or even useless if the boys lost a single support or special piece, and it seemed easy for pieces to get lost when they were dealing with so many.  This one has stayed together quite well--it sits nicely atop his dresser<br /><br />The cars run in a continuous loop.  After rounding the curve and going through the loop, the car ends by coming onto the ramp where it started.  It goes up until it loses momentum and stops, and then slides backwards down the ramp to go through the whole circuit in reverse!  My boys were amazed by that little feat until we shut it off and manually walked a car through the path.  After going through in reverse, the next time it starts it is going forward again.  One continuous circuit, and my boys found it mesmerizing.<br /><br />It's Easy to Assemble<br />---------------------<br />Fewer parts also means something else: easier assembly.  I've had a few sets that left me scratching my head and staring at the instructions, but not this one.  In fact, our son was able to assemble the entire set himself (save for two times he asked me to help get things to snap into place).  It was a real treat to sit back and watch him lay out the pieces and put it together.<br /><br />An Exciting Bonus (for me, at least)<br />------------------------------------<br />Another thing that made this set different from most other sets we've had is that it didn't come with a sheet of stickers.  That's the part I liked least about so many of the other set: way too many stickers (and obscure places to put them).  This set came with all labels and stickers in place, so I was smiling twice as wide as my son put it together.<br /><br />Don't Forget the Motor (or the batteries)<br />-----------------------------------------<br />Sure, this unit will burn through a couple of \\"D\\" batteries after hours of play.  If it is going to be an everyday toy, either stock up on cheap batteries, or invest in some rechargeable ones.<br /><br />That motor is really the best part of the set, though, so don't wish it away. It's the reason this one is called the \\"starter\\" set.  That little motor (two rotating rubber wheels that propel the cars) will send them a long way on a flat surface, and can even propel them uphill quite a ways.  If you have other sets, or extra track, your child will be able to use the motor to propel cars up to a higher surface (e.g., table, dresser) before letting gravity return the car to him or her.  If you end up with multiple motors, you can create some pretty extensive setups. [There was even a line of video games created around that premise, and they're quite fun!]<br /><br />Educational? Really?<br />--------------------<br />I gave this set three stars for its educational value. \\"Three?,\\" you might ask.  Yes, three.  I felt that putting together the set helped my son better understand how pictures can relate to real world objects.  He had to turn parts around to try to line them up with other parts, teaching him (whether he realized it or not) about perspective and exploded diagrams.  Then, once playing, he got to experiment with multiple cars on the circuit at once.  He soon learned that some cars took less time to complete one cycle than did others (as evidenced when the second car would catch up the first and cause a crash).  He and his siblings also found out that they could put threecars that weighed about the same on the track at the same time--if they timed it just right.  Even that line you see on most set boxes, \\"Not all cars for use with all sets\\", provided a little opportunity to learn.  My son soon found out which cars would and would not run successfully, and even figured out why one of his favorite trucks would not go far at all (\\"The wheels lift it up too high so it doesn't get pushed.\\").  It's just a good reminder that kids can learn from almost any play.<br /><br />This Parent's Verdict<br />---------------------<br />A definate thumbs-up! It's one of only two or three Hot Wheels sets I'd recommend.en that line you see on most set boxes, \\"Not all cars for use with all sets\\", provided a little opportunity to learn.

B0002VKZL6|4.0|I received the CD more quickly than anticipated and it is in great condition!!  I had this CD before and it got scratched and then I lost my I-tunes so had to rebuild my entire library - You completed my Mark Knopfler collection - I really can't thank you enough.
B0041L0Z1S|5.0|I actually didn't know this versions existed until I ran across it and being a huge Jane Austen fan, immediately had to try it. I ABSOLUTELY loved it. The actors all did an incredible job, the scenery was beautiful and the movie stayed pretty true to the book. The whole series take about 4 hours to watch and I liken it to the 6 hour BBC version of Pride and Prejudice, where the characters are expounded on so much more. Definitely worth your time and money! :)
B003VPWXRO|5.0|So many young girls struggle with body image- it's good to know that it affects celebrity's too- she went through some of the same things I did, but for a longer span of time. It's inspiring to know that there is life after an eating disorder, and that it's possible to be happy with your natural body.
B00005AREQ|5.0|This album is as amazing now on CD as it was then at 33&1/3rd and Tape. I love the rawness, emotion and power including the *little* glitches left in.  Mind bending effort/talent from all the players.  Diamond Dust, words cannot describe how beautiful this song is.  Jeff Beck may be the finest, funkiest, most original guatarist on the planet, but I think his best virtue is surrounding himself with fine writers and musicians and keeping true to his own *style*.  Something he continues to do.  May he never stop...:)  kirajayd
B0046MOVD0|2.0|OK so, yeah the storyline isn't all that mind blowing, but the effects usually are. I really enjoyed the first 3 installments but this was a HUGE disappointment.  The writers/directors/producers made this film more for 3D than for the RE fans.  This movie reminds me so much of The Matrix it was hard to find RE in it.  Other than Alice, a few characters from the last installment and some zombies it bore little resemblance.  I like Alice and some of the others coming back from the last installment but it's about time to delv into what Umbrella is and how this all began.  Not sure I'll rush out to buy a next installment if there is one....    Very disappointed.........
B003TXS5AC|5.0|This is an excellent album by an old band.  What makes this particular album so special for me is its release on vinyl - a two-record 180-gram picture to be specific.  This particular release is a limited-edition picture disc destined no doubt to become a collector's item.  Purchased from GoHastings, the records arrived within the expected time frame and well packaged.  Disc #1 has a slight wobble or warp but in San Antonio Texas, October (the month I purchased it) can still be brutally hot.  The album was found outside the front door (thanks, UPS) and the wobble likely might have been caused from direct sunlight and no fault of the seller or manufacturer.  There was NO problem playing the album.     There were or possibly still are some other \\"special\\" edition CD's available but some of the extras are on-line videos and are available for apparently a limited time.  The vinyl came with no offers or specials.  The offer of on-line extras would have been nice but the point was to own a special edition of records, and that's exactly what I wanted.  I'm very pleased by this release from a great metal band.        With the advent of the CD and then MP3's it would appear music in the form of the old standard vinyl album had become a thing of the past.  Not so!  Fortunately there are some artists and recording companies that still issue contemporary music on this old medium.  I continue enjoy playing albums in the vinyl format.  Please note: there are a number of computer programs that are designed to allow a user to play through a computer, remove pops, clicks and surface noise and then be transferred to MP3 format or CD.  I use a program called Wave Corrector ([...] or just Google \\"Wave Corrector\\" and you'll get it).  Wave Corrector is an excellent program, easy to use with lifetime updates.  Get the professional model if you want this one.  The vinyl makes a better archive than CD's which can rot, scratch, get lost... MP3 have their own Achille's heel.
B001UV4XWY|2.0|The Box was a disappointment. I was hoping for some surprises, but it turned out to be a relatively simple tale of people who do a bad thing to profit from it and eventually pay for it. Ho hum. Some of it seemed downright silly. The acting was okay, but nothing to write home about.
0446679089|1.0|While the author grabs your attention at the beginning he seems to have lost interest (like myself) in the middle of the book. If it were not for it being my first Kindle book I would have put it down. The plot change mid narrative is just stupid and overworked.Pirate treasure? Give me a break. I kept hoping he would lose the pirates and salvage the book. It never happened.<br /><br /> While I like cop humor the author has dumbed down Corey's sense of it to the middle school level.(sorry kids). Also, while the last third of the book picks up in action, the actions of the protagonist are unreasonable, unbelievable (yes I know its ficton)and outright disgusting. He is no hero with honor - fictional or not.  The sad thing is that the author set the stage for what could have been an absolutely riveting novel and seems to have just gotten lazy. Perhaps the publisher was on his back for a first draft. Whatever... read something else.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I fell in love with this band immediately all those years ago when they first came out. But I had no idea the staying power of this music. Year after year, I keep going back to this album. The music stays fresh and real. And now that they've make two more albums we know it was not a flash in the pan. These guys are visionaries. It all started with this album though, and this is the best. It is this album that defines my adulthood, and I'm mid thirties so that's saying something. If you allow yourself to connect with it, this music makes you feel a tingling up your spine and makes you stand up and scream.
B000002TQB|5.0|Blur were the best British band of the 1990s. Musically they could do, and did, any type of music that they wanted. Each album was different from the last. For an fantastic overview of 1990s American rock, from Nirvana to Pavement to Beck, you only need hear how this band distilled these influences on 1997s [[ASIN:B000000WDA Blur]].<br /><br />Parklife from 1994 is the British mirror image of the above album. This wide-scoped album threads new wave disco (\\"Girls & Boys,\\") 1960s jangle pop (\\"Tracy Jacks,) the pub song title track,  and Scott Walker/Gerry And The Pace Makers orchestration with \\"To The End.\\" This only scratches the surface of Parklife.<br /><br />Despite the style base running, Parklife holds together brilliantly. Everything here is definitively British--musically and culturally. Listen to the singing--how the English accents are stoked. Listen to how all the classic British forms are preserved, but sound completely modern, almost futuristic. Look at the front and back photos--the dog races and the band attending them.<br /><br />The greatness of Parklife emerges not from big ideas, but proven ideas that are reactivated with Blur's incredible attention to detail. Every textured guitar string bend, each bass slide, every synth bleep here has a reason, and is executed with the accuracy of the best 1970s pop session bands.<br /><br />Blur has amazing technical ability, but more important, they play music like a method actor adapts a character. The music exudes the persona Blur chooses to give the album.<br /><br />Some of this may take getting used to for 2011 ears used to American Rock--or what is left of it. This only shows how pure the forms on Parklife are.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|This BBC series is simply amazing. Beautiful in many aspects and David Attenborough does such an incredible job with the narrations.    A must have for every blu-ray player owner.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|This comes with three discs  -Disc one-: Three Movie types  -Disc two-: Special Features  -Disc three-: Something Extra    The case that actually holds the discs looks kind of like a book. Which is pretty cool. It was around $60 At Best Buy, and I got it on Amazon for $24. Good Deal.

I have fallen in love with her art, it is all beautiful and heart-felt. I'm now rocking down road with a SUV full of toddlers and we all sing along! HAHAHA
1439107955|5.0|For many years, history buffs have suffered through a lack of works on the history of medicine.  This book rectifies that deficiency with respect to cancer.  I was reluctant to start the book because the topic is so large I feared the book may not do it justice. However, the author lays a compelling roadmap of the blood born and solid tumors and the surgical, radiological, and chemotherapy treatments.  This should really be read by everyone to help spread understanding of the challeneg of cancer.
B003EYVXTG|3.0|If one were to take the women from this film and combine them with the women from \\"The Fighter\\", you would scare the hell out of people. Our heroine is tough. And has no need \\"to man up\\" as she is advised. The cast gives different looks at some actors many people know from comedies. This one remains with you. It ain't pretty. But take a look.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I was absolutely blown away by this book.  The author takes what could have been a mediocre, tv movie of the week type concept and makes it brilliant by her choice of perspective.  The fact that the book is narrated entirely by five year old Jack means that the reader doesn't always know exactly what is going on.  Jack is so written well that, even when talking about horrific or tragic events, the book remains almost light hearted.  For all that he has seen, he still has a true sense of innocence.    Because I couldn't always understand what Jack was talking about immediately, I decided to go back and read the book a second time.  It was just as good, if not better, the second time.  This is a very thought provoking book that you will want to share with friends.
0393072231|5.0|When I bought a house in 2005 and was being pushed to adjustable rate mortgages and heard how they worked I though \\"Wow- gonna be a ton of foreclosures coming in a couple of years.\\" (ask my wife if you think I'm making this up). The idea that this notion escaped all of Wall Street and fell into the laps of just a handful of guys is quite stunning.
B004EJ14V2|4.0|I was bored and have gift cards to use so I decided to rent the movie. I'm not its intended audience for sure since I have read the scarlet letter and am a guy in college. With that said, the themes the movie explores (if you get around all the hollywood nonsense) are actually grounded in reality and are relatable to many. Don't expect Casablanca or something mind-blowing, it is a light hearted take at an ages old theme that exists as much today as it ever has.
B002MUAJ2A|3.0|The book was Ok. It didn't set me on fire and I didn't finish the book thinking I learned anything of great significance. On the plus it was a very easy read. Which I like. The chapters were a page or two long and it flowed pretty good. However, some of the things in the book I didn't agree with at all. Such as when talking about not being everything to everyone. They seem to really pound home the point that they refuse to change for anyone. Specifically with their Highrise Crm which isn't very good at all. It so far behind the times its not even funny. But, they sell it so I guess it doesn't matter. But it almost becomes arrogant.    The book just didn't do anything for me. It was an ok read because it was a fast read. For me, I would have rather read at the bookstore for free. Grab a cup of coffee and read it in two hours at the bookstore and save yourself the money.

030726999X|1.0|Like many other people, I've enjoyed the previous two novels.  This one however was painfully slow and utterly uninteresting.  Completely self-indulgent, the author wrote this one for himself and it clearly shows.  I was very very sorry that I even started this novel and thus felt obliged to finish it, a most unwelcome part of my daily activities till it was over.
038532653X|4.0|Don't get confused by Skellig's \\"Children's Book\\" label. This story is deep and thought-provoking. Children can certainly read and enjoy it, but many of the subtleties might go unnoticed.<br /><br />The book's protagonist, Michael, is one of the most instantly sympathetic characters I've ever met in a story. David Almond tells the story gracefully, with few words, ignoring what is not relevant. The result is that the story was somewhat shorter than I'd expected it to be, but no matter. It's still excellent. Skellig, the mysterious birdlike man he befriends, and Mina, the artistic girl next door, are powerful supporting characters. The parents in the story, though minor characters, are nevertheless sympathetic and well-drawn.<br /><br />Definitely worth a read, especially for readers who enjoyed Madeleine L'Engle's Time Quintet or Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea series.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|I first discovered Josh Groban many years ago when I connected the young man with the booming voice that resonated out of my radio. I was astonished at his talent, and the beauty of his songs. I have collected all of his works, many of them in concert, and even had the glorious experience of first being introduced to \\"My December\\" (in my personal opinion, one of his prettiest songs) live in concert. I had wondered what happened to him and was glad to hear he had an album coming out... but as time passed and no audio clips went up here or anywhere else (sadly, I did not have access to streaming the album as many fans did), my uncertainty grew. As it turns out, my concern was not unwarranted -- I did hear \\"Hidden Away\\" and enjoyed it, but when I got the album for Christmas, the rest of the tracks filled me with disappointment.     I will not critique his talent or complain about the arrangements; I will simply say that this is in a different style, and I'm not a big fan of this particular variety of music. I like dramatic, powerful, deeply emotional songs much more than slower arrangements. Intense debate over this album with friends gave me a perfect way to articulate what I feel is \\"wrong\\" with this album -- it isn't epic. There are no \\"epic\\" songs. His other albums had them -- music that swelled out of your stereo and filled you with a feeling of awe or breathlessness, as his voice filled the room. These tracks don't fill the space. They don't show off his voice! They seem quiet, and demure, and to be totally honest, bland. I was bored. Normally, I only skip one or two tracks on his albums that are not to my liking -- but here, I was constantly pushing \\"next\\" on my first listen-through, and feeling terrible about it. I have listened to it on repeat for days, hoping it would grow on me, but it hasn't. I hoped it would.     My advice for potential buyers -- listen to it first. Go down to your local Borders and put it through the sample device, or listen to portions of it on his website. Don't just plunk down your hard-earned cash unless you either a) like that style of music, or b) are going to love anything he does. Because this isn't in his usual style, and it may not suit your tastes.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Another great HBO series!  I bought it for my daughter, who has never seen this Golden Globe, Emmy, & Grammy award-winning series.  I've followed it from the beginning, and enjoy seeing where the characters have come from, and how they've developed along the way.  I've not seen any of the other \\"vampire\\"-based movies/series, and am quite content in watching only this series.  I found this purchase to be an excellent value for a new, complete, first series.

B001O1O71C|4.0|This is a book about perceptions, the nature of good and evil and friendship. The writing style is clever; simple in style yet complex in the issues it deals with, elegant in presentation yet haunting in content. It's told from the perspective of nine year old Bruno and his innocent viewpoint sets this book apart from other Holocaust novels. As with most children he has an innate, as yet untainted sense of justice that is positively thought provoking and also casts a dark shadow of doom. The focus of the book is a friendship he develops with Shmuel, a victim of the Holocaust, who is also nine years old. The author takes you on an emotional journey and into the minds of these two boys showing you the Holocaust from the perspective of a child. It's a story that you won't forget. Although the main character is nine years old, the book is aimed at an older audience (12+ years). It would be a great book to read with your child as an introduction to the Holocaust and will lead to many moral issue discussions.<br /><br />Review previously posted at: [...]
B00005B3Z6|5.0|I admit I am a self-obsessed fan of the American version of \\"Queer as Folk\\". I discovered the series in its second year when it was originally broadcast on Canada's \\"Showtime\\" network and it has become my favorite television show of all-time. I never thought a series about a bunch of gay men living in Pittsburg would replace shows like \\"Here's Lucy\\", \\"Bewitched\\", and \\"The Golden Girls\\" in my heart. but \\"Queer as Folk\\" has. I have seen me watch the series over and over, sort of what Annie Wilkes does in \\"Misery\\" with her novels, but thankfully I don't think I am disturbed as Annie; I hope not anyway! So, I recently borrowed a friends box set of the original \\"Queer as Folk\\" and I have to say that version is excellent too from its daring storylines to the superb acting. What I find interesting is how Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman were able to Amercianize \\"Queer as Folk\\" for their North American audience by staying true to the series' original bible. It's also neat to compare both versions to see how close the American \\"Queer as Folk\\" is to the original. This is evident in the pilot episodes as we meet a young teen entering the gay village of a large metropolitan city where he meets an older and successful man who changes his life forever. While there the teen also meets, through his new love interest, various friends and relatives, and it is through the teen that we as an audience are taken on this journey of what gay life is really like.<br /><br /> I was a little worried about the strong British dialect of \\"Queer as Folk\\", but this is a very minor issue as once your immersed into the stories you forget all about the english accents. The original \\"Queer as Folk\\" really wasn't a series, but a mini-series in American terms as only 10 episodes were filmed for the two year run.<br /><br /> This particular box set is long out-of-print and very expensive to purchase from private collectors, but the good news is the studio that owns the original \\"Queer as Folk\\" is releasing the entire series again in one complete set in the summer of 2011. That is something I am looking froward to!again in one complete set in the summer of 2011. That is something I am looking froward to!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Room is told from the point of view of its 5-year-old protagonist Jack. Jack and his Ma have been in Room for Jack's whole life, so his entire world is 11'x11'.<br /><br />Donoghue does a brilliant job of writing from Jack's point of view, using language and language structures that a child of his age and experience might use. Ma makes some interesting parenting choices, but who knows what any of us would do in the same circumstance?<br /><br />I have a pretty strict rule of never buying Kindle books that cost more than $10, but this one just sounded too fantastic. It's worth a couple of extra bucks. This is a fascinating novel and very hard to put down. You have been warned.

I don't agree they sold out. but if they did so what. they are doing good with their success.  struggling bands I think get jealous because they didn't get the chance to sell out.  go Arcade Fire!

B002BU0DPE|3.0|First off, the headset provides quality sound for an exceptional price. Directions for setup are very simple, and I was able to start using the headset within 5 minutes from taking it out of the package.    However, there are a few minor issues:  -Packaging is TERRIBLE. It took at least 5 minutes to open the package with sharp scissors and overall a poorly designed package made it difficult to remove the small adapter piece.    -Tight fit. I played for well over an hour and the headband began to agitate my head as well as the ear pieces started to affect the top portions of my ears. I'm sure this issue will slowly resolve once they get used several times.    -Lots of cords. Finally, if you plan to use the headset with HDMI or component video output, be prepared to use all the cords provided plus the additional PS3 A/V red/white/(yellow) cable. The setup of these are easy but they really get in the way if you're used to wireless PS3 devices. The headset cable is very long providing functionality, but the clip-on adapter needs to be clipped to your body or else it weighs down the headset.    Overall, I recommend this product and hope that these minor issues will be worked out with an updated version in the future.
0062024329|3.0|I have been meaning to read The Alchemist for a long time, and I like graphic novels.  When this book came out, it was the perfect combo.  It's a good read and the drawings are pleasing in color and layout.  HOWEVER, I can tell this is a very collaborative work.  The characters have more inconsistencies in page-to-page rendering than I am used to in graphic novels.  The general characteristics are there, but the style is different from frame to frame (check out the glasses that the crystal merchant wears).  I think the artist should have listed his collaborators instead of grouping them as \\"others\\".
B003L0V758|5.0|When I first listened to the whole album, my initial thought was, \\"I'm glad I bought this while it was on sale!\\" There were only two or three 'fast' songs compared to Metropolis; The Chase Suite and I just thought it was boring. But as I listened to it again and again, the album grew on me until I was sorry I had bought the MP3 download and not the actual CD.  In a world where an \\"artist's\\" best songs are the singles and all of the album tracks are forgettable, Janelle Monae shines as truly gifted. Instead of using a single and her body to sell her album, Janelle Monae uses her musical talent and creativity. The ArchAndriod is a whole package, a cohesive unit and the listener would be robbing themselves if they only bought a few songs off of the album.   Janelle Monae's The ArchAndroid is absolutely one of the best albums of 2010!
0307594777|5.0|Compared to past decades, strong female characters turn up rather often in popular fiction these days.  Even so, it's still difficult to find a novel that presents a truly iconic female in a lead role.  That's one big reason why I loved Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy and why I am recommending these three books to all of my friends.  Lisbeth Salander is a one-in-a-million personality and, as others have said, it's remarkable that Larsson was able to write her in such a way that readers not only empathize with Salander but actually identify with her struggles.<br /><br />Brilliant characterization is also evident in several of the other main characters.  For instance, \\"Kalle F'ing Bloomkvist,\\" as Salander calls him, is not your average journalist/detective.  He's got a few traits that only a mother could love, and even then perhaps not, and this is something he shares with Salander.  Despite their quirks and unconventional behaviors, most readers embrace these two, right along with Erika Berger, the married editor with whom Bloomkvist has an ongoing sexual liaison -- with her husband's knowledge and support!<br /><br />If someone asked me what these novels were about, I would not say that they are about a conspiracy, although they are.  Nor would I call them mysteries, detective stories or crime novels, even though to some extent those labels would be accurate.  I believe these novels are, at their core, a loud protest about violence against women.  Larsson uses statistics and epigraphs at the head of each chapter to highlight the abuse of women in nations that are supposedly enlightened and \\"developed.\\"  He exposes a tacit, unorganized conspiracy, which allows women to be exploited and abused, very often for commercial gain.<br /><br />It's important to note that Larsson does not indict men, although he does describe some despicable actions carried out by several male characters. (And female ones for that matter.) Rather, he challenges us all to examine our own complicity in minimizing and/or covering up misogynist behaviors simply because we prefer not to look at or acknowledge the crimes against women that often take place much too close to home.<br /><br />Lisabeth Salander is an excellent vehicle for doing this because she is not particularly attractive and never amenable.  She is, in fact, the opposite, and because of this we as readers are pressed to understand that violence against women -- even difficult ones -- can never be condoned or accepted as collateral damage.  Larsson seems to be saying that women, whether they are hookers, criminals, lesbians, or just misfits like Salander, should be treated with dignity. And if that can't be managed, then just to be let alone.g and/or covering up misogynist behaviors simply because we prefer not to look at or acknowledge the crimes against women that often take place much too close to home.

0307272702|5.0|I read Good \\"Calories Bad Calories\\" last year after watching a lecture from Robert Lustig - \\"Sugar: The Bitter Truth.\\" One thing lead to another searching on the internet, looking for more information on this hypothesis and I landed at the \\"Good Calories Bad Calories\\" Amazon page. After reading the first few pages of that, I immediately bought it, devoured it, and have been trying to let everyone know about the information in it. I tried lending the book to my parents but I think they got lost somewhere in the dense medical/scientific information and did not finish the book. That book is great, but my review here is about \\"Why We Get Fat\\" and it's intended to be the type of book you can lend your parents as opposed to \\"Good Calories Bad Calories\\" and it achieves that excellently. It only took me a day to get through the book, it restates all the important points from \\"Good Calories Bad Calories\\" and it only gets as technical as it needs to be for a less technical audience. I just finished the book and will be handing it over to my parents asap and I'm positive they will finish this book!
1427210497|4.0|DO believe the hype. This was a very good book about a family -- yes a dysfunctional family in some ways -- but is what I think is a fairly astute picture of a husband, wife, son, and daughter facing and trying to deal with the changes that life and circumstance put in front of them. Rather than write a synopsis of the plot, I would rather the reader consider this merely a portrait of a Midwestern middle class family - no, not a typical family per se, but one that could live next door to you.<br /><br />Franzen's prose is stark. He writes with a pen as sharp as a scalpel sometimes revealing the inner workings of the mind that perhaps are normally kept hidden -- even from ourselves. I liked his other book, [[ASIN:0312421273 The Corrections: A Novel]], as well. He has a biting sarcasm and a wry sense of humor that I find incredible and his perceptions about life are razor edged. I know he's not for everyone. He has a way of writing and putting out there the things you don't ever want to think or say and I believe he makes many very uncomfortable. I think he's brilliant.<br /><br />I am not usually a person who prefers an audiobook to a paper book, but I quickly became engrossed in the story. The reader, David LeDoux, did male voices extremely well. Unfortunately his rendering of the voice of Lalitha got on my nerves! His accent made her unlikeable and she sounded rather simpering which was the opposite of what I believe that Franzen intended that character to be. Other than that annoyance, the voice, despite the changing points of view, was easy to follow and I thought he delivered them believable and entirely human.<br /><br />The only thing I really didn't like that much about the way the story was told was the way the author jumped back and forth between characters and with sequence. I'm a reader who prefers sequential narrative; nevertheless I found the novel deeply satisfying and one that many of us who struggle with obstacles and unexpected hurdles can understand.<br /><br />All things considered, I highly recommend this book.<br />Update: Had to go get the actual book in hardcover since I enjoyed the audio so much. I really hope that others find it as wonderful as I did -- though I may need some serious therapy now!red, I highly recommend this book.

Even for only .99 cents (I'm willing to pay a little for well formatted public domain books), I want to be able to enjoy the transcripts.<br /><br />I have since learned the value of downloading samples where available.

0684135051|1.0|I've been following in Vogue knitting a series by EB's daughter about her mother's percentage system.  Wanting to start a sweater I thought i'd get a book from the originator.  Looking in Amazon no one explains what is in the books and the publisher has provided no insight so I opted for the one that had the most positive reviews.      Got the book yesterday and YUCK!  Guess I didn't drink the EB kool-aid, but don't know when i've seen such an unattractive and poorly illustrated book.  Immediate thought, it was cheap so probably wouldn't be worth shipping to return, so let's see if I can at least get the infamous EB percentage system from the book.  I find a reference to it in the stream of consciousness sweater pattern so I look in the index for where she describes the formulas--no not mentioned there.  I look back through the book hoping to find instructions & hopefully some useful diagrams to match.  NO!! not there.  Finally I realize that the explanation is buried within the wordy \\"pattern\\" for the sweater-you get it doled out to you within the description of doing a seamless sweater.      Granted I have not read the book from cover to cover as others say they have, but I wasn't looking for a leisurely read!  I was looking for instructions, and if they are here they are hidden within the text.  Since i find the book so visually unappealing I have no desire to hunt for the information.  It is by no means a book to use for reference as the small number of useful bits are so deeply buried as to be impossible to find and those that are easily located are accompanied by too few illustrations to really prove helpful.    Summary, unless you want to have to read the WHOLE book to attempt getting anything useful from it, and you don't mind very poor &/or dated illustrations (all B&W) , then this book is not for you. Check it out from your library first before you waste money as I have.

B002MGIIZE|5.0|This has been one of my top ten favorites since the first time I saw it. When I hold a movie in high regard, I try to wait as long as possible between viewings so I can experience the story with the same awe - and often more - than the first time.    I'm not in any way knocking the fact that many people watch their favorites quite often. My husband and I are especially inclined to do that with comedies full of great one-liners that make us laugh by simply quoting something (Christpher Guest movies are a good example). But personally, I need to be in the right frame of mind - with very little distraction - when I watch an intense film that requires attention to detail.    It's been a little while since I last saw Donnie Darko, and I was very hesitant tonight to watch the director's cut because I didn't want to risk having the story spoiled somehow. I'm glad I decided to because it didn't change a thing for me. But I'm also very thankful that I've seen the original several times because it was a thrill to \\"get it\\" ... and even more so each time I watched it.     If the only version that had ever been released was the director's cut, I wouldn't have a different view about the film. No offense intended to anyone, but if you've watched both versions and are still at a total loss as to what happened, this movie is definitely not for you. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that!     If you're like me and you do not have every detail of the theatrical version burned to memory, the difference between it and the director's cut was not monumental and didn't change my perception in any way. Now I'm compelled to watch the original again so I can compare the two.     For those who haven't seen the film: the acting is superb, the story is very compelling, and it's probably not at all what you were expecting to see. Keep an open mind.
0312370849|2.0|I just finished Sara's Key for a book club. This was the second time I had started the book.  Admittedly, I had to force myself to finish it.  I felt the writing lacked something(freshness, new ideas anything really!) It was commonplace. I hate when writers use trite saying, like \\"aging like a fine wine\\". Honestly, the I found the writing boring.  The entire pregnancy, her odd husband , now that was weird, and I never felt myseld caring for any of the characters.  The relationships were  poorly developed, and I really hated Julia by the end. What a wet noodle she was.  Never standing up to her husband, being such a ninny, ugh.    When the story was told from Sara's perspective, that was a bit more interesting.  I had never heard of the Vel d'Hiv round-up, and was facinated.  Maybe she should have just stuck with Sarah's story.      Don't waste your time. If you want a gripping, moving Holocaust story read \\"Those Who Save Us\\" by Jenna Blum.  Now there is a story that will get you thinking.
B00479SVBU|5.0|The transmitter works excellent and sounded better than the last one I had purchased online.  I was surprised to find it had an external 3.5mm output I can also use for sound.  Definately worth the money. My only concern is that my jump drive seems to be a little loose when is inserted and  comes out fairly easily from the slot. I don't see any major problems unless I go 4 wheeling in my truck.  It is very simple to change from folder to folder and also easy to read on the nice display screen.  The only thing that could make this any better is light up keys on the remote :)
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|I saw & heard Bruno Mars for the 1st time when he performed on Saturday Night Live, & I immediately downloaded Doo-Wops & Hooligans.     No one is more surpised than me that I LOVE this album. It's not the type of music I usually listen to but Bruno has a great voice & a knack for crafting catchy tunes & lyrics, and this album is just plain FUN.    Upbeat tempos, good instrumental arrangements, solid vocals, just all-around well produced & well-performed, great to listen to if you're trying to get up & get moving.    In my opinion, Mars' talent & skill far exceed that of many other performers in the Pop genre. 25 years old, 7 grammy nominations, his first first two charting radio singles as a lead artist making No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 List -- what's not to like.    The CD download price makes it a no-brainer to check out Bruno & see what all the buzz is about!!
B00288KNLS|3.0|I've seen some of the reviews on here from parents, basically referring it to a few steps away from being Satanic.  Dark?  The Nightmare Before Christmas was much darker than this movie- as well as the Corpse Bride.  Unless your kids aren't exposed to what's on the Cartoon Network and are ultra-sensitive, I'm going to say that this movie is okay to watch.  (Being that you might consider turning their heads at a certain part of the film as I will soon mention.)      It is about a young girl whose parents are always busy off doing their own thing.  Whenever Coraline goes to them for anything, they push her off, telling her to go count windows, making bargains of having her leave them alone for awhile if they do something for her, etc.  She isn't a sweet little girl as some of the other reviewers probably expected her to be.  She's more of a preteen experiencing a little bit of teenaged angst.  But because of this boredom, Coraline comes across a small door to a little world, where she meets her \\"Other Mother\\" and father.  As wonderful as this world may seem at first, it seems that the Other Mother has other motives for enticing Coraline to remain over there.    My daughter is now five, and we watched it together last year together.  It's not that big of a deal really- until you get to the \\"Other\\" neighbors who live downstairs.  Apparently, the two elderly eccentric women had a kind of vaudeville act together in their younger days, where they performed acrobatics, theater, etc. (They also collect taxidermed Scottish terriers of pets that have passed, and dress them in angel costumes.  I cringed how the taller one was costumed, and wondered why this would be necessary to put into a film, targeted at a younger audience.  (She was very much 'endowed', and wearing pasties and a barely visible bikini bottom, flying on a trapeze.  Even Coraline was shocked!)  I can only guess this was an inside joke amongst those making the film.  Nonetheless, my daughter now instinctively turns her head until it's alright to look again.    Honestly though, the rest of the movie isn't that big of a deal.  Other reviewers say that the \\"Other Mother\\" gets killed, therefore making it violent.  (Spoiler- all that happens to her, is that her mechanical hand gets broken off as Coraline escapes and slams the door behind her.  And then the hand, and the key to the door, get dumped into the well at the end.  A couple of the sawdust-filled mice also get pounced on by the cat in the story. But since they are 'doll-like', I don't understand how they then could be \\"killed\\".)     Other than that, the plotline is kind of boring. They have characters in it that aren't really necessary, and the ending isn't very satisfying, because you don't get a full grasp on any closure going on with the other characters in the story.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|Original, engaging Indie Folk-Rock, the best I've heard in a while. Rich, lush vocals, solid harmonies, unique & original instrumentation, all-in-all, a really impressive debut.    All four members of the group can sing & play multiple instruments. Their love of music shines through on every track. You can hear elements of bluegrass, classic rock, classic folk & even a hint of celtic style.    I think this is a band people will either really love or really hate, with not much in between. If you're ready for something a little different that really makes you listen, give it a try.  The album download price makes it worth taking a chance if you're not already a fan.

B000U3859K|5.0|It's hard to accurately convey the plot of \\"Slaughter House-Five\\" without taking several pages to explain the layers and depth and abstraction with which Kurt Vonnegut handles the gruesome nature.  The best I can do is offer enough to hook potential readers in order to encourage them to take the journey themselves.<br /><br />Vonnegut tells the story of the non-hero, the less than average soldier who bumbled through World War II surviving purely on good luck and the good will of others.  Billy Pilgrim is a Chaplain's Assistant that really has no interest in the war, in life, or anything for that matter.  He's blessed with some extraordinary ability to experience as a non-linear concept... an ability which he maintains no control of.  His life becomes a series of incongruent instances later relayed by two war veterans aptly named \\"The Children's Crusade\\".  Billy becomes an unsuspecting illustration of the uncertainties of war.<br /><br />So admittedly, the plot sounds confusing in a summary, but Vonnegut delivers a power and almost psychedelic tale which vividly reflects on both the humanity and inanity of human warfare.  The story is woven together quite well the chaos of both war and Billy's inability to hold himself within time.  Vonnegut writes masterfully delivering powerful questions for the reader and portraying the story of the non-hero.
0743454537|5.0|This story,  I had to set it down a couple of times to cry! I was actually crying while I read this story. It's masterfully written.  I have a child that was born with cancer, and as Picoult described the procedures it was like I was right back there in the oncology ward with my son.  Even if you don't have a child that has been a victim/survivor of cancer this is a book that is not to be missed!!

B00280LYHS|5.0|This is the best series in the history of series. Period. End of sentence. It even beats Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. If you love this series you will love the Lost Hero and that series. It has the same main charcters and camp half blood as the last book. It has Thalia, Annabeth, Percy, talks about Nico and Silena and Beckendorf. You will love the book the Lost Hero.
0399156577|5.0|Wow, Im not even done with this one yet and I love it!! I love Simon Doyle's character...wow.  I've ready plenty of Nora Robert books but I must say this character is unique and sexy as hell.  Im already missing him and havent finished the book yet. Im about 80% through it on my kindle and am taking my time because I know I will probably not get this excited and emotional on my next read. Way to go Nora!!
030726999X|4.0|A lot of loose ends at the ending. While I enjoyed the series I had some questions at the end of the book.
B002ZG977Y|3.0|This film was not as exciting as I'd hoped it'd be.  While the special effects were pretty nice, there were no, \\"edge of your seat\\" moments, and the whole thing seemed to end pretty quickly.  Kind of left me with the same feeling you get when you feel a sneeze building up and then - without warning - it vanishes.  I don't remember if the original version was as uneventful as this.  Looking for an original, exciting, Greek mythology movie that leaves you feeling satisfied?  Try \\"Percy Jackson And The Olympians ~ The Lightning Thief.\\"  Overall rating from this viewer: C+ for up-to-date special effects.
1400064287|5.0|This is an exceptional book rife with concrete examples. Perhaps Made to Stick is strongest when it compares \\"normal\\" messages with superior ones made more concrete, unexpected, credible, etc.<br /><br />I like to think that I'm being clear when I speak and write but I'd be lying if I said that people always understood me. This book made me think about how I communicate--and how I can do it better.<br /><br />Should be required reading. Great book.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I too am a great fan of the 'Roaring 20's, having read a number of books on that era, including the book that this series is based on.  With Martin Scorsese at the helm, I eagerly looked forward to this series and Boardwalk Empire is another outstanding hit from HBO with a marvelous cast of very well suited characters.  The highlight of course, is Steve Buscemi, an excellent choice for 'Nucky', greedy, corrupt, and deadly, but at the same time loyal and caring, what a contrast he is.  This is a deeply flawed man, yet you can't help but believe that he has a heart.      Other excellent actors include:  Stephen Graham, a young and very, very deadly Al Capone.  Vincent Piazza, the Lucky Luciano character, you can feel his rage always ready to bubble to the surface.  Michael Sthulbarg as an oily, organized, and extremely efficient Arnold Rothstein (the man responsible for the 1919 Black Sox scandal).  Michael Shannon as Prohibition Agent Van Alden, the point man in the Federal crackdown on Atlantic's City's corruption, plays a deeply disturbed man with some very heavy duty emotional (and physical) scars.  Michael Kenneth Williams does a fabulous job playing \\"Chalky\\" White, Nucky's go-to man in the black community.  Gretchen Mol is beautiful as Gillian and gives an understated but incredibly powerful performance.  This doesn't cover the entire cast, but everyone, even the less featured actors do an excellent job of transporting us to that era.  The musical track is funny, entertaining, and sometimes simply haunting, but it is woven so well into the story lines that the viewer might not notice how compelling it can be.    The sets, the scenes, the clothing, the speech, and the music of the era, all combine to make this a rich and very entertaining experience.  If you are a fan of this era, you will not be disappointed.

B001UV4XFG|2.0|I never read the third book and I was a little confused about the movie. The movie skipped around alot to a variety of scenes and the big anticipated fight scene was short and average. I did get sick of seeing Bella kiss wolf then the vampire then the wolf. SHEESH~~~~     I'm glad I rented the movie; rather than saw it.
B000MUK3HI|5.0|I love the album Hey Jude in my opinon its one of the best beatles albums which makes me wonder why they didnt include it in the 2009 remaster i know the songs are all there but you lose the whole album feel. in all its a wounderful album. it does have a bit more of a greatest hits feel than a complete album but the songs hey jude, lady madana, and reveloution make the album more than worth while alone. like i said i think its a great album and suggest it to anyone.
0470876417|5.0|This was my first ever book to understand Business model concept. If you are a beginner or even someone who understands the business language, it is highly recommended book for you.     The most important this about this book is that it squeezes the buisness model into a pictorial diagram which is easy to understand. If you ever come across an idea, you can quicky drwa a rough buiness model. It makes you UNDERSTAND buiness model fundamentals.  Thanks guys for saving me money for MBA.

B0043RT8JU|4.0|Having, in a period of a year or so, read AN ABUNDANCE OF KATHERINES and LOOKING FOR ALASKA I must say one small thing: Green's books are all about finding the unfindable. In ALASKA the protagonist looks for her spiritually, in KATHERINES he looks for her physically, and in PAPER TOWNS it's both--a physical, spiritual connection that Quentin seeks. Of course, by each books' end it's never what we thought it would be. Such is life. And truly, that's the best way to describe Green's novels: just life. Green describes just-life moments beautifully in his simplicity of detail that goes quite further and deeper than the audience could actually imagine. Perhaps this certain novel strikes a chord (or dare I say string?) in me because I read it at a time when my high school career was coming to a close; the novel adapted those feelings perfectly, the ending of a routine and going and leaving into the unknown.     What saddens me about this book from the others is that while I was reading this one it still felt more like a search for Margo than it did for a search for Quentin. At its core, though, it's truly a book about secondary characters than it ever is about Margo and I love it even more for that. I love the way the relationships in this book weave in and out of each other because of how it mirrors life at this age and the ending of high school.     All in all, reading another one of Green's novels is never a bad thing. If you gain nothing, at least gain the memorable quotes. Quotes that could quite possibly be with me a lifetime.
B003INBOEM|5.0|I bought this DVD for my son, because he loves martial arts movies.  I have to say this is one of the best ones I've seen so far!  It was entertaining, the acting was done well, even with the English dubbed it was very good!  I would highly recommend this movie!
B00394A4UK|5.0|I have never truly read a mystery, nothing like this anyway, so to get into the genre with this book was like taking a huge 10-step dive. But before I praise the book, I must say one horridly bad thing: the \\"AND\\"s. There are so many of them! Sometimes it's just \\"and\\" after \\"and\\" after \\"and.\\"<br /><br />Somewhat like \\"They walked to the gate and the gate was open and they walked through the gate and they arrived to the door.\\" Yikes! It felt a little dragged on, I thought perhaps it was trying to add a feel to the story, but it didn't. It just added annoyance on my part. Thankfully, it was only in the beginning, or perhaps I didn't notice it after I got into the story.<br /><br />But I digress. The rest of the story works extremely well; you go through this world (I say loosely, not meaning supernaturally) with Teddy and see it through his eyes and each time he makes a revelation you get startled or shocked. At some points this book had me at the edge of my seat -- literally. Not because it's a terrifyingly scary book, but because the suspense is done so well that it almost becomes your story and you feel as if you're right there with the characters, scared for your life... or theirs. It's honestly like living vicariously through them.<br /><br />'Shutter Island' is a true page-turner that will keep you guessing to the very last word. And that's not a hyperbolic statement.
B00009MGGI|5.0|This series held me spellbound.  The writing, the casting and the acting (especially Ian Richardson) were all superb.    I loved the various plot twists and the frequent use of British understatement.  The subtle humor that ran througout was also a treat.
B00007L4MJ|3.0|The new Kino release of the \\"complete\\" Metropolis...All but 6-8 minutes anyway is now available with the original Huppertz score.  Definitely superior to all previous versions and the score is excellent, really helping to set the film's tone.  You'll be pleased to see the Thin Man in action and Freder and Josaphat getting to do some real daring-do in the Workers City.
B003YOZNBK|1.0|First Megan appears on Jennifer's body as demon possessed, now she plays a woman who trades her body for money in Jonah Hex. Just for your own thinking. I had expectations not high, but I still had them, that the movie would be fine to watch, but it was plain boring with ugly Jonah Hex and a lot of evil, damnation, few weapons which of course are very sci-fi,and a short plot. Jonah plays a dark hero who looks for vengeance and revenge. Stupid, not worth watching, waste of time.
1439177783|5.0|After having read this book over the course of less than 36 hours I'm awe struck! What a relief to gain so much incite from a book that I thought was going to be just another \\"How my life got so screwed up\\" biography. Portia wrote a powerful, revealing, candid, memoir. She really let's the reader get inside her head. It's as if she just opening herself up completely to help us see that the miserable feeling of inadequacy so many of us feel are just stories we tell ourselves and can only have power of you if you allow them to.    I now feel inspired to begin to heal myself of my need to impress those around me and to learn to live my life the way it's meant to be lived. Authentically as my true self. A must read for anyone who has ever suffered from trying to live up to the perceived expectations of others.
B0017U7PT6|5.0|It's a beautiful movie, great story and I simply love it. I am really confused at why so many people rated it bad on amazon. This is one of my top-favorite movies. I really enjoy everything about that movie. Director put a great efforts in it and it is just THAT amazing! Give it a shot! Characters are great,story is sweet and the whole movie is just that great!
B0046MOVD0|5.0|This is what I've been waiting for! Fantastic movie, plot and finally I saw clones of Alice. The only minus is that it felt short. When i paused the movie I couldn't believe how fast 30 minutes were gone! I  love this movie and I wish they do next movies even better! Also it felt a little too much of slow-motion in the movie, the could've shorten it and replace with character development and something else. Because it might get a little boring all these slow-motions after few times of watching. I strongly suggest to get the movie and watch it!
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Very Good movie! Based on 'Firefly\\" tv show. I wish they made a sequel to this! I really liked this one! 5 stars!

B0021L8UPS|5.0|I love the pro-adoption commentary before this movie. It's a PSA of sorts telling you that all orphans are not bad kids and the following movie is not based in fact. I don't see why that was necessary, but it is humorous to think that anyone would believe this film is non-fiction.<br /><br />The children in this movie are believable and they carry much of the films weight. Isabelle Fuhrman is spectacular in her performance. She is nothing like a young, wooden MacCauley Calkin who often seemed to be reading directly from a cue card (see Home Alone). Dad thinks she is innocent and sweet, but she secretly trys to destroy the dynamics of the family. As her character evolves and we learn more and more about her, she loses that sweet exterior and we see her for the murderous little heathen that she really is. Her language is very graphic at times, but not without purpose.<br /><br />The entire cast were fine in their roles. The parents, and their need of another child seemed very convincing. The flow of the film from beginning to end makes for a great thriller that I highly recommend to all. It's not the same old typical slasher film with the same typical ending... and the acting is superb!<br /><br />Thank you for reading....
B0043RGY9W|5.0|I wasn't going to review this because I got what I expected, and while a few people here complained because they basically didn't like this \\"new David Gilmour album\\", they were put straight by comments.  I changed my mind about writing a review because I just saw the artwork on the standard CD offering.  I purchased the special edition, but back then I am pretty sure the new little sticker was not on any of the editions.  I do not know who is responsible for the round sticker, with the prism, a rainbow colored circle, AND the words PINK FLOYD, but shame on them.  Look at the rectangular sticker.  It already says everything you need to know (and I mean EVERYTHING).  If you do not know who David Gilmour is or that he is from Pink Floyd, then this album is not for you.  Any inference that you will be getting something resembling a Pink Floyd album is just plain false advertising.  So my point is, when I bought this, I knew what I was getting.  But now, when I read reviews from people saying it is not what they expected, I feel they are within their rights to say this, given the pink floydy, prismy, rainbowey, dark side of the mooney label they put on it.  Shame.
0307454541|1.0|I just finished the first of the 3: \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\\" I will read the second one just because I have it since a friend gave it to me, but I don't know about the third. I realize this is the hottest thing since \\"Inception\\" and that EVERYONE has read them, but... I don't get it.<br /><br />Honestly, I could have walked away from the book at any point. It was obvious to me from the beginning of the Vanger family story that Harriet was still alive and well somewhere. The sexual torture and brutality (always, always, always inflicted by men on women) has gotten really old with me as I have gotten really old. Isn't there any other way, other than extreme victimization, to make a female character's back-story interesting? The rest of the Dragon Tattoo story was as overwrought as a tangle of wild brambles. It could have stood a whole lot of pruning in my estimation.<br /><br />The most interesting part of the book for me, maybe the only interesting part, is that it's set in Sweden, so you get a look at a different culture, a different way of life, a different climate. I almost always enjoy reading authors from other countries translated into English just for that experience.<br /><br />So, I've read it. I'm no longer the only person on earth who hasn't. I'll even proceed on to the Played with Fire book and pray that Ms. Salander becomes a more interesting woman with a greater claim to fame than sexual victimization and Asberger's.

B0000CDL93|5.0|I do not need to add to all the other superlatives given by most of the other reviewers, but what makes this film in my opinion The most important film in American History is the inescapable conclusion that  first there was indeed a conspiracy that resulted in the murder of our president, and also that the leaders of the federal government conspired to keep that conspiracy  a secret. Second, the most profound truthis that this criminal conspiracy of silence continues unto this day. and it amounts to an illegal tyrannical action  against all Americans by our own Government.  Each president the day after he takes the oath of office, when He fails to take action against these conspirators is an accessory after the fact, and a traitor.    The film ends with a statement and a challenge that is profound.  The past is prologue.  That past goes  up until the right now that confronts us with the moral imperative to band together and overthrow this criminal conspiracy, or acknowledge that not only are we living under a dictatorship, of the oligarchy. but that we are content to do so and admit that our claim to a democratic government is a sham.

0312600844|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this book. Jonathan Franzen's new novel \\"Freedom\\" is his first in eight years after the amazing \\"The Corrections\\", but the wait has been worth it.  Freedom is funny, wry, intelligent, witty, provocative, sly, and completely entertaining.     I normally do not read best sellers because they tend to be dull and formulaic.  However, based on Franzen's previous writing, I decided to take a chance.      \\"Freedom\\" follows the lives of Walter and Patty Berglund, from the time they meet at the University of Minnesota back in the 1970s, through the present day when they are in their mid-50s.  Walter is a perfectionist, fussy, holier-than-thou environmental do-gooder and a bit of a crank.  Patty is a basketball star and attracted more to Walter's rock and roll singer roommate Richard Katz (lead singer of The Traumatics).  Walter is equally unimpressed with Patty, because Patty doesn't go anywhere without her obsessive roommate Eliza, who has a bit of a stalker-fan fixation on Patty.      After introducing Walter and Patty, the book fast forwards to their life much later, where they have been married for about 20 years, and are barely talking to each other.  The pages on their love life, such as it is, are hilarious.  We find out that they have a 16-year old son who is independent and stubborn, and has just moved in with his 17-year old girlfriend and her parents next door. Apparently, he had been having a torrid affair with his girlfriend since he was 12 years old?!  The 18-year old daughter is a little more average and is focused on getting into a good college.     Walter is now an environmental lawyer working on a complicated plan to first strip-mine all the coal from a mountain in West Virginia, and then turn it into a bird sanctuary.  Patty stays home and drinks a little too much wine.  It turns out that Patty has never quite gotten over her infatuation with Walter's roommate Richard.  When Richard comes to visit his old pal Walter, obviously, thereare problems.  (Conflict makes for good drama.)     Walter starts to fall for his young assistant Lalitha when they go on a road trip to West Virginia to establish the bird sanctuary.  Walter's attempts to be a liberal environmentalist in red-neck West Virginia are quite amusing.     I won't give away any more of the plot because it's too good to spoil.      One of the notable things about the book is how obsessed Walter is about the environment.  I felt that by portraying Walter as an environmental nut, the author was making fun of people who care about the environment, and I still can't tell where the author stands on the issues he brings up in the book - overpopulation, mountain top removal for coal mining, and songbird depredation by housecats.  (It's interesting to note that Walter really starts hating cats after he has a falling out with his friend Richard Katz.)  Is the author an environmentalist, or is he just making fun of them?  Maybe yes on both accounts - I couldn't quite tell.     Oprah selected Franzen's previous book \\"The Corrections\\" as an Oprah book club selection, and Franzen refused to allow Oprah to endorse his book, citing her previous selections as \\"poor literature\\".  Well, I guess Franzen changed his mind, because his new book \\"Freedom\\" is a welcome selection to the Oprah book club, and he's even going on her show to promote it.  Oprah gushes about \\"Freedom\\", proclaiming it to be \\"exquisite,\\" a \\"tour de force,\\" a \\"masterpiece,\\" \\"everything you want in a book,\\" and \\"one of the best novels I have ever read.\\"    I'm not sure about one of the best-ever novels, but it's darn good. Especially for a best seller.

B00005OCMR|3.0|I just do not understand all the five-star reviews for Tron. It's a strange little over-rated film.  Yes, I'm sure it was light-years ahead of its time when first made, but from what I saw, the story wasn't very intriguing, and the acting was just plain bad throughout most of the film. Some of the more metaphysical aspects of the film were interesting, however, such as the allegorical parallels between Flynn and Christ, coming in from the \\"other, higher world\\" to mingle with the simple people or programs to save them from evil.  Very nice touch there.     However, I find this film to be highly, highly, over-rated.  The entertainment value simply is not present. I wonder how many of the rave reviews are from people who first saw the film as children and loved it. It must have some nostalgia factor going for it.  Personally, I skipped the film the first time it came out because it looked like one big video game, and I did not play video games then and still do not (huge waste of my time). I guess I'm just not the \\"target audience\\" for this film. For a much better film along the same lines, check out the relatively little known \\"The Thirteenth Floor\\".  Now that's a great film.
0385341008|4.0|i was lent this book by my grandmother. i enjoyed the characters in this book, and quirky little encounters they had with inhabiting soldiers.  i would reccomend this book particularly to an older audience, as i found difficulty relating to the protagonist's style which somewhat annoyed me!<br /><br />this book was worth reading, but not one i was unable to put down
0375703764|4.0|IMO the best horror books are those that don't directly expose the creature or fright.  This is one of those books. It leaves you on edge, however, wondering what is going on and what is going to happen next.  Even when things are calm, you wait for the next event.  As others have said, it is also a story inside a story.  You could probably read the main story and enjoy it, however, if you want to stretch your imagination and test your reading skills, go ahead and read all of it, including the voluminous footnotes that comprise the \\"outer\\" story.  The author does an excellent job of painting the characters- I can see Johnny Truant and even feel his turmoil.  The term \\"horror\\" book can be applied to books that feature supernatural or unexplained beings or it can apply to regular (well, almost) human beings who live or subject others to a state of horror.  This book accomplishes both.  The book is a challenge, but a fun one, and one thatshouldn't be read just once.  There are too many nuances.
0451169514|4.0|The title of my review is an actual Stephen King quote and it is amazing in its simplicity and imagery. This review is based on my recent re-read of \\"It\\" which I first read when it came out and once in the 90's. It holds some nostalgia for me much like the main characters who King has bounce between 1957-58 and 1984-85 in their twice epic battle with a powerful life-form. This daunting entity preys on an individual's personal fear allowing King to provide a rich tableau of horrible characters and situations. Like most of his novels, King pits good versus evil with a few pawns between these forces.<br /><br />The premise of \\"It\\" going through a cycle of hibernation then awakening for mayhem and killing every 25-30 years was highly original at the time. And my favorite part of the book is King's coverage of the carnage in previous cycles dating first back to 1740-1743 when \\"It\\" is credited with the disappearance of over three hundred settlers from Derry Township, analogous to Roanoke Island. My father was fond of saying that every town, regardless of size, holds all the vices of a large citiy. The town of Derry holds that and more - it has \\"It\\".<br /><br />One final comment, I believe that King's contribution to literature will be one of the must debated of all time. And he, himself, will have a voice in the debate based on his own quotes such as, \\"I am the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and Fries.\\"
B002OG5GT8|4.0|I have spent more money than this trying to build my own headphone amps, and they didn't have rechargeable batteries, USB power or a tiny form factor. Nice improvement in sound quality using Grado SR-80s, especially on the lower end, everything just sounds fuller and tighter.    The one downside is that the amp tends to pick up lots of EMI noise when it's plugged into a USB port that is plugged into a computer. I wasn't really surprised by this, because computers are really noisy and I have a little experience with electronics I know EMI is a pain, and cables/wires basically act like antennae, and I can't really expect anything this cheap to be immune. So for my purposes I have one permanently plugged into my desktop computer and I power it from a USB<->wall power adapter (think iPhone or Kindle power adapter) and that provides wall-powered and noise free operation.

B003Q6D1YW|4.0|What started out as a simple premise for a documentary gets really weird. A guy takes photos for a living and meets a young girl online who paints those very pictures. He then begins talking to her mom on the phone and falls in love with her older sister, through facebook. After nine months he decides to go meet her and her family that he feels he is in some way now a part of. So a surprise visit turns confusing when things don't quite add up.<br /><br />I remembered seeing the trailer for Catfish a long time ago and it looked intriguing, but at the same time it was very misleading. It made it seem like this social networking documentary was going to take a turn towards something really dark and almost horror like in nature. That's not true, but I still found it to be a fascinating look into how fake online profiles are most of the time. As was the case with me, you are better off not knowing any details of this documentary, other than the basic plot, before watching.<br /><br />Anybody who says this thing is fake is wrong. I was looking for moments of acting from all of the people on camera, but they came across as natural. There is even a special feature where the filmmakers discuss this very notion.<br /><br />They only major negative is that mystery of the first half is much better than everything that followed once the secret is revealed. Then again I was expecting some kind of tragic ending based on the trailer, so that really raised the suspense that was later deflated.<br /><br />Catfish is worth a rental. Watching it with a few people will likely lead to some good discussions afterwards.

B003X27L9U|5.0|As I write this, I'm somewhere over an ocean on my way to Tokyo. I've just finished Room by Emma Donoghue and my insides feel they've just gone a dozen rounds with Iron Mike Tyson. I need pasta. I need to pace up and down and rub my hands over my face. I need to hug my kids. My hands are shaking: it's hard to type even though I'm in a business seat and the flight's smooth as a baby's bum. I found Room confronting. Very.<br /><br />The style just blew me away. It's hard enough to write a thousand words in first person present tense. Donoghue does it for a whole book using the words of a five-year old. Well done indeed.<br /><br />The plot is simple enough, but the story isn't. Not by a long shot. It's sadly all too realistic; you'll get what I mean when you read it. The story and the manner in which it is told deliver immense complexity and astute observations of the main characters. Donoghue takes you inside the heads of a two vastly different people who don't just share an experience, they are the experience. The ending is a little predictable, but even though I knew what was coming, I still wanted to applaud. I'm not saying if the ending is happy or sad. Read Room yourself.<br /><br />The characters; Jack, his mum Ma and the supporting cast within Room and without, are written with frightening reality. Especially Jack. Donoghue must have some kind of mind-reading skill to get the insides of a five year-old's head so spot on. She didn't quite nail the a couple of other non-centrals like cops or shrinks. The real heroine in the tale is Ma. Her struggles, triumphs and failures are there, warts and all. Something I really appreciated with Room was how real Ma is, how despite her flaws and weaknesses, her son Jack is her whole world and she his.<br /><br />I gave Room 6/10. Mind you that's from a purely objective point of view. Room touched me for reasons you'll probably understand once you've read it. To me it's a 10/10. Do read Room. Do.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|A must read for the 'learned' reader. This is an advanced book. Although it is family friendly, it's not something I would suggest reading to a child because I don't think they would be able to keep up for the most part. You would constantly have to explain the meaning of many words. A good book for high school age and up.<br /><br />Although the words portrayed in A Christmas Carol give you a sense of cheer and you can easily see the grump that Scrooge is, there is a 'hidden' message that you will find in the second half of this book. Christmas is not just about good cheer or being neighborly. It's about overcoming your personal 'demons' and being stronger than your issues. Choosing to be joyful as opposed to being sorry for yourself.<br /><br />I'm rambling. Excellent literature and I recommend it if you have not read it!
B000VUCIZE|5.0|Being one of the few 27 year olds in this country raised atheist but educated on the beliefs of all five major religions, this was a book that I could not put down once I started. Harris' magnificent writing style coupled with the facts he poses make this book a must-read for any non-believer or anyone looking for answers where faith has given none. I just purchased Letter to a Christian Nation and plan to start that tonight. I can't wait!
B003EV6DBM|4.0|I was told not to get the fifth series - the writing was bad, the original creators and crew had left, it sucked, it was bad, don't DO IT!<br />But I love doctor Who? So in I dived.  So, here is the review.<br />The Good - The Daleks are back.  And the writing isn't bad.  In fact many of the plots, characters, settings, and themes were very solid, strong, and welcomed.  Daleks in World War Two was going to happen sooner or later - it was just a matter of time.  I don't wish to spoil anything but the stories were good, many were tight and without plot holes, and frankly I enjoyed it.<br />The Bad - If you took the Doctor and his friends out of some of the episodes and replaced them with the main characters from Farscape, or Stargate, or Land of the Lost, or The Sarah Jane Smith Adventures you would not in any way upset that individual story.  It is good science fiction but not yet reached the level of good Doctor Who.  But give Matt Smith time.  I've been told some of the original writers are coming back for the Sixth Series.<br />As always, enjoyed the extras but wanted more commentaries.  Don't start getting cheap on us, BBC!
B0000027RL|5.0|If you are considering buying this album, you are one of the few people who does not already own it. Pearl Jam is one of the greatest rock bands of all time, and this is their best album. Every single song here is either good or great. This is hard rock that does everything right: incredible vocals by Eddie Vedder, amazing guitar parts, and an overall drive that few bands can match. The music is complex and layered while at the same time being visceral and gritty, with instrumentals you can rock out to and sing-along catchy hooks. \\"Ten\\" is one of the greatest records ever made, a defining sound of the 90s, and a set of songs that will live on forever.    If you are not of the generation that grew up in the 90s, and are just discovering music like Pearl Jam, \\"Ten\\" is required listening. And even if you're the most casual of fans, and want to own the hit songs you have heard on the radio for the last decade-and-a-half, \\"Ten\\" will not dissapoint.

B001P9EQH8|1.0|I own a pair of Shure SRH 840s They are pretty high end I wanted a bit more volume out of them so I bought this amp. Hooked it up and it sounded awful. I put the amp on my $50 running sonys and it still sounded bad. I would get a better quality or a different brand if I was to buy another amp. It arrived on time and in great shape from seller just a bad product.
B0042JIL2E|5.0|First of all, this is her third album, not second as some have written. I don't believe the first was released outside of Europe, however.     I wrote an earlier review before I had purchased the CD, although I had heard most of the songs -- either live or on YouTube. Now I've purchased the CD, and can recommend it without hesitation. Most are great, only a few are merely good. This lady writes most of her own songs, sings them with great passion and energy, and has a great combination of innocence and sass. I met her after her concert in Nashville, TN a year ago and can assure you she's oozing with charisma. I saw her again recently in Chicago on her tour with Jeff Beck and she stopped a song to boot a heckler. Classic.     She's a cause worth supporting, given her talent, work ethic and attitude. She kicked around for years before she \\"made it,\\" although one could argue she's still in the process of making it as the mainstream remains painfully unaware.     I own hundreds of albums and CDs and like many categories of music, but Imelda has become my all-time favorite female musical artist.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Very riveting and exciting. Slow in the beginning but it builds excitement and is an edge of your seat read!
0060763280|5.0|I once read that 10% of the people control 90% of the wealth and 90% of the people control 10% of the wealth. Like the ninety percenters the ten percenters come in all shape, size and colors. The diffrence of the two groups is the way they think. This book gets to the heart of the matter. Get your taughts right. Wealth starts in the head. Be the master of your taughts!!! You get this right and you will become a ten percenter.    Thank you Harv.
B0000026UV|5.0|This album reveals decades of picking esperience and tremedous mutual respect. It proves that real music can span generations and outlast the vagaries of pop music fans. Their widely different picking styles are evident, but it is difficult - and fun - to decide who is playing when on their interchanging riffs.<br /><br />The artists present a series of glorious snapshots that display their cabilities and adaptabilities. The synergy present during the sessions is impossible to conceal; the pleasure is obvious in their banter and jokes, especially in the \\"Some Changes Made\\" track. Kudos to the band as well for helping bring the mix together. If you get through \\"Next time I'm in Town\\" without wishing they'd met again, you are stronger than I am.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Before I read this book, I read a bunch of the (mostly bad) reviews.  I could not believe that Childs could do 11 good (review wise) ones in a row, then do a really bad one, then another good one.  So I read it in spite of the bad reviews, and I'm glad I did.  I cannot understand all the bad reviews.  I may get in trouble here, but I think that the plot was very good (although touching on some perhaps controversial subjects) and I think that anyone with an inquiring mind would have been very interested in the info on main battle tanks (the accuracy of which I can personally vouch for) and, for another example, the discussion as to how cell phones work, which was very interesting to my inquiring mind.  My conclusion...in the future, and where books of fiction are concerned, I will not be influenced by reader reviews, but rather read a book and form my own opinions.  And write a review based on them.
B0037NB6QE|5.0|The story follows 4 very different women.  I simply could not put it down because each chapter follows a different woman and I was dying to find out what happened next!  In the end, you can't help but fall in love with all of them, and I admit that I cried with their heartaches and then again at their victories.
0439023513|3.0|Mockingjay is a fictional book that takes place in the future. The people of District 13 want to bring down the leaders in the Capitol, who have imposed totalitarian rule. The main characters are three teenagers, Katniss, Gale, and Peeta. Katniss's ultimate goal is to kill President Snow, who has been the dictator of Panem and has ordered the Hunger Games to happen every year.         Mockingjay is the third book of a trilogy. If you are looking for action read the other two books. Suzanne Collins tried to do too much with Mockingjay by trying to write it as both an action and a romance book. The book needs to concentrate more on action and not on romance. Collins talks too much about Katniss's relationships with Peeta and Gale. I thought the epilogue, in which Collins says that Katniss and Peeta married and had children, was not necessary. Teens aren't fans of romance; they are fans of action.     I liked the action parts of the book.  For example, it was scary when District 13 got Peeta back and he was crazy because the Capitol had hijacked him. Other interesting parts are when Katniss and her team go into the Capitol and when pods get set off causing different violent things to happen. The best part of the book is at the end when there is total chaos in the Capitol and Katniss and Gale are travelling through the streets.  Pods are being set off causing people to die. Katniss is able to make it to the president's mansion. It was suspenseful because you didn't know what was going to happen. The best thing about the book is that President Snow finally dies.    Collins explains Katniss's thoughts and feelings in a way that holds the reader's attention. A meaningful part was when Prim, the sister of Katniss, gets blown up. There is one point in the book when Katniss, instead of killing President Snow, kills President Coin. Collins describes how crazy Katniss becomes after she kills Coin and how much she wants to kill herself. Collins tries to explain how people thinkand feel when a totalitarian government rules them and during war.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is by far one of my all time favorite books.  I remain intrigued and mystified by cells of Henrietta Lacks.  It's amazing to think that any picture of a cell is probably one of hers.  She is by far the absolute unsung hero of disease care - without her we may still be in the dark ages.

The movie and box was in pristine condition, no scratches or dented edges like it was tossed around during storage or delivery. My toddler loves it and we sat through the entire movie eating popcorn. Homerun on the delivery!
B0043URV8M|3.0|The movie was very satisfying; dark and serious and quite true to the book. The music was very supportive of that in the theatre, exciting in the action parts and moody in an appropriate way elsewhere. By itself however, the music does not hold up as well. Once again the film producers have changed composers and each new one must feel compelled to put their own stamp of originality on it. In so doing, they have repeatedly lost the theme by Williams that worked so strongly for Potter in the earlier films. Like Superman and James Bond and Spiderman a hero with theme music is stronger when the films come back to that. Heaven spare us from the composers who take on a hero, but then can't bear to use someone else's theme, presumably because their ego and felt need to show that the new film has \\"new\\" music gets in the way. The director of the film may have thought this too. They are wrong. If Mr. Williams is too old to be brought back for the very last Harry Potter film to come, we can only hope his theme will be featured strongly as Harry finally has his showdown with \\"He whose name must not be mentioned\\". Overall I liked this music much more than the last few which were frankly boring, but a melody/theme was lacking and heros need their themes to be heroic.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|i could not put this book down!!!! i received a kindle for christmas and have been reading on it every day since then. i kept seeing this book on the editors pick but i had reservations about buying it. after reading other reviews i decided to give it a shot!! i could not stop reading it!!! its really amazing and it actually gave me a better understanding of children as well. although the child in this book was trapped in the room it still gave a general idea as to what child understand and do not understand! i recommend it to anyone!
0307346617|5.0|Books and movies about zombies have a fixed plot:    - Main character wakes up and the planet is ruled by zombies  - He meets a group of other survivors and finds a safe-house to hide  - The zombies break-in, the survivors escape headed to nowhere  - The ending is open for a sequel    World War Z is the first book about Zombies I read that does not follow that plot at all. It explains step-by-step how zombies came to rule the world and what people did to claim back the planet.  It is more a war chronicle with a (very) non conventional enemy. Written like a fictional interview to war survivors, it describes plenty of modern warfare scenarios, tacticts and weapons, showing how they failed or needed to be adapted when applied to a zombie war.  As a book about war, it also addresses the issue of people trying to take advantge of the misery around them selling protection or other services or stealing from the others.  Some other reader did not like the moral behind a few stories in the book. That's a matter of taste, but that does not make the book less enjoyable.  One more thing Zombies fan will like is the fact the book does not change the basic rules (as it happens in other books): a bite means infection, Zombies are clumsy and walk slowly, but are determined to eat fresh flesh at any cost, they have no intelligence, but a terrific instinct etc.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|I liked this movie. Angelina Jolie looks hotter than when she did in GIA. I am not going to tell you that I have all the movies she was in. Although, I am close to being sure that I have all those currently available. There was a lot of nudity in GIA but not in this one. Still liked this one better.   The movie was great. It was a simple James Bond type movie. I doubt any of the James' including Sean Connery would have liked the extensive physicality of the project.  BACK TO WHY I AM HERE...I AM AN IDIOT WHEN IT COMES TO CONTROLS...  I had a hard time finding the 2 alternate versions. Mind you I am talking DVD not Blu Ray.   Put it in. Get to the selection bar showing Play Scenes ETc...Hit the ENTER button in the cluster of direction arrows. You will come up with the additional movies.  I am ashamed to admit but Amazon was being real nice and sending me a replacement. I am going to have to RTS the additional movie when it arrives.  My neighbor watched it...no problem....Put it in my computer dvd...Showed all 3 available.  The movie is great. Enjoy. Don't pick at it just enjoy.
B002RKRTGO|1.0|If Amazon would have let me, I would have rated it *no* stars.  This Kindle version of the \\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" has a huge flaw: every time a character reads aloud from a text, that text is omitted from this edition. Here is an actual quote from my Kindle:<br /><br />\\"Dr. Mortimer [. . .] read in a high, cracking voice the following curious, old-world narrative:<br />When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative ...\\"<br /><br />Considering that the omitted passages include the actual legend of the Hound, as well as the account of the death that brought the client to Holmes, this renders the story unreadable.

B0043ZDU1E|5.0|This is a fantastic CD (9 tracks) release by the talented singer-songwriter Loreena McKennitt, titled \\"The Wind That Shakes The Barley\\". This great CD is a collection of great Celtic traditional songs (very soothing music). This CD opens with a great track \\"As I Roved Out\\" (great Celtic traditional/folk music with great vocals). Other great tracks include \\"On A Bright May Morning\\", \\"Brian Boru's March\\" (great Spanish guitar/flute combination), \\"Down By The Sally Gardens\\" (traditional music arranged by Loreena McKennitt & lyrics by the famous poet W B Yeats), \\"The Star Of Country Down\\", \\"The Wind That Shakes The Barley\\" (great laid-back track with great vocal. Traditional music arranged by Loreena McKennitt & lyrics by Robert Dwyer Joyce), \\"The Death Of Queen Jane\\" (great acoustic guitar/flute combination) & \\"The Parting Glass\\" (great laid-back track with great vocals). My pick of the bunch is track 8, \\"The Emigration Tunes\\" (a solid track/gem with a fantastic flute intro, wonderful acoustic guitar & this song is composed by Loreena McKennitt. This is my favourite track & hence the title of my review). On overall, this CD is a collection of great Celtic traditional songs (very soothimg music), a highly recommended listening.

B001C3KCSY|5.0|This is an excellently well put together rock album by the talented rock band Kings Of Leon, titled \\"Only By The Night\\". This is how a well molded rock album should be or sound. The CD opens with a great track \\"Closer\\" : great melody & clear great vocals.

Solid tracks/gems include \\"Manhattan\\" (a fantastic rhythm guitar & melody) & \\"Notion\\" (a beautiful keyboard intro, wonderful guitars & melody. This is my favourite track from this great CD). On overall, this CD has great (music, guitars, chorus & melody), very well produced, a highly recommended listening!
0439023513|5.0|When I started this book I was hoping it would wrap everything up, that it would have to perfect ending. I wanted the type of ending that made me feel good inside, that made me say \\"AWW!\\" Even though that was my initial reaction to the ending, it took a lot of energy on my part to get to the ending I so desired.     Just as Katniss is trying to rebuild a life in District 13, she becomes a peace in another person's game. Depressing, right? Well, she doesn't quite relize it yet, but she contructs her image as the mockingjay, the ultimate symble of the rebellion.  During this time, she is tortured with thoughts of Peeta and other's who were taken prisoner to the Capitol, her inablity to be confused as to what's reality and what isn't because of a concusion she sustained in Catching Fire.    Tensions rise in Panem and suddenly everyone is caught up in an ugly war with a thirst to wipe out the entire human population, it seems. Everyone is put in danger.    Many people die, even the most dear to our hearts. Their is even a time where Katniss herself is dead inside.    Despite the agony of the falling action, a peaceful epiphony does arise, if peaceful still exists in the country of Panem.

B004FD398S|5.0|I have had a 3d TV for over a year now, waiting for this movie to come out in 3d.  Its too bad that you can't just buy it in the store, but Panasonic has rights until Feb 2012, last i heard.  I have previously watched \\"Open Season\\", \\"Monster House\\", \\"Grand Canyon Adventure\\", \\"Dispicible Me\\", and a few other 3d blu-rays on my TV, but this has better 3d effects than the other 3d blu-rays.  The only thing that compares in my opinion, and has even better 3d effects than this movie is Avatar for the X-box 360.  You must have the HDMI-out X-box for it to work and of course a 3d-tv and stereoscopic 3d glasses.  My setup is a 73\\" Mitsubishi DLP, with a Samsung 3d blu-ray player and an X-box 360.<br />  I'm not going to go into how the movie was, i'm sure anyone reading this has already seen it.  If you haven't, rent it.  Then determine if you like it enough to buy it in 3d. I really enjoyed the film.

B002UZCJ8Y|4.0|This movie is a total justification of the whole Amazon review system. So first of all congratulations and thank you to every reviewer- all most interesting and readable from the 1 stars to the 5 stars, from the serious to the smart-assed one liners such as Zoe who wished her surrogate had watched it for her..    This, in turn, guarantees the movie at least 3 stars. For the simple reason that it makes you think. It is not just a slick, high budget hollywood movie. In fact a lot of it is not slick or visually impressive at all. The street scenes and the 90s Eurocopter chopper do not compare with the settings of, say, Blade Runner. In fact it was Blade Runner that I was drawn to as comparison rather than I Robot or The Island...    I can not compete with the erudition and wit of so many but here are a couple of points.    As an old snob and book reader, I have never read any graphic novels - despite their massive sales and influence. Sorry. Can someone tell us how well this sticks to the original?    As a Sci-Fi fan of over 50 years I am very grateful that from time to time we are thrown movie bones to chew. I seem to always like them, even and especially comedies like Galaxy Quest and Dave. Only do not like them if dull and bombastic like 2001 or the Planet of the Apes remake....    So I loved every minute of the film. It is not in the least a 'Robots Gone Wrong' film but a discussion as to whether the Humans have gone wrong in totally relying on robots. When you think at the end, as with most sci fi and all time travel except the Simpsons episode, there are massive holes in the concept. Not least being how on earth the humans might even dream of surviving without robots....    The casting is mostly brilliant; loved Bruce and the Bruce robot.Earned the movie an extra star. Feel a bit sorry that the farmer from Babe (Cromwell) has had to be so dark in everything since 6 Feet Under.    And there is one breathtaking moment about 25 minutes into the film when you realisethat almost every living person you have seen in the movie so far is , in fact, a robot.Then you meet a human still working and he is a fat slob!    So at a time of collapsing numbers in movie theatres, mindless films like The Expendables and movies aimed mainly at pre-teens allowed a night out, let us be grateful for a film aimed at adults and with plenty to think about.
1597801585|4.0|The entire story takes place in Bangkok, Thailand, sometime in the future. The days are dark days and the world is pretty much under the control of calories companies (like PurCal and AgriGen), who manage to bio-engineer seeds that are infertile. That is, they are good only for one use. As such, people are depended on them to supply new seeds each planting season. They also employ people who tour the globe to track and get hold of regular seeds (fertile ones) that are kept in secrecy in various places.<br /><br />Bangkok is one of the places who kept itself self-sustained and is yet to be enslaved to the calories companies. And this is were the story takes places. The plot interweaves the tales of Anderson, an AgriGen agent who manages a decoy factory, Hock Seng, a Chinese who is second in command in that factory, Jaidee and Kanya, officers in the local police, the White shirts, and Emiko, the windup girl. The windup girl is a \\"new people\\", an highly advanced genetically modified humans that are being created in Japan. Emiko is an highly attractive and was genetically programmed to obey and serve people, somewhat similar to a geisha.<br /><br />The author, Paolo Bacigalupi, tells an engaging and interesting story, with well developed characters. There were several occasions where I though that the descriptions were too graphic for me, especially with respect to Emiko in Raleigh's nightclub. However, my only criticism is the Emiko is not given more screen time, as it will be very interesting to see what happens to her in the future.<br /><br />The most disturbing part of the story is that it describes a reality that is not far fetched, as today we already have different seeds that were bio-engineered, patented and are now controlled by giant agricultural companies. The importance of the book is by providing a glimpse to a possible future that might be lurking right around the corner, if things will not be regulated fast. Overall, to sum up I can say that this is a very interesting and original science-fiction book, with an eye opening message to a possible future.nal science-fiction book, with an eye opening message to a possible future.

B00015N5T2|5.0|W&G is a great sitcom, although I did find that once Debra Messing (Grace) became pregnant in real life and they no longer used her for some of the physical comedy you came to expect from Grace, it was a less than stellar season, but all in all the show has some of the funniest lines and concepts I have seen on TV, mostly from Karen and Jack.  The guest stars over the years have been quite impressive too.  I noticed that the 1 star comments are from the same poster x3, and he does this over and over again on all his posts, whether they are 5 stars, 3 or 1.  Seems he likes to see his vote count more than others, so please consider the redundant posts when considering whether or not to buy.  Also the discs have more jokes than the TV re-runs as Life Time runs more commercials than NBC did in prime time, and so a few jokes are cut here and there, and you get to see them again on the discs.

B001UV4XFG|4.0|It's a fun movie. Like candy: if you like it-you'll enjoy it, if you hate sugar you're out of luck. You can take it for the sci-fi fantasy it is- fall in and enjoy or pick it apart and laugh at it. Pretty enjoyable either way. Probably my favorite of the three for better cinematography and well, better everything.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book grabbed my attention instantly. It was a very sad story but it was told from a five year old's perspective which brought some innocence that most adults don't even think about. I loved it and will definitely read it again.

B002BU0DPE|3.0|My son wanted some gaming headphones for the PS3.  I tried a couple other headsets that were not suitable for the PS3.  In short, headsets with standard analog input/output or USB input/output don't really work for the PS3.   The reason is complicated but it involves how the PS3 separates the game sound from the chat sound.   Turtle Beach designed special connectors and circuitry for the PX-21 especially to allow chat and game sound to be combined in one headset.   He's happy. I'm happy.  By the way, Amazon had the best price as of early January 2011.    UPDATE 1-23-11  These headphones broke less than three weeks after we got them.  I'll test Turtle Beach's warranty service and update this report accordingly.    UPDATE 2-14-11  Turtle Beach provided replacement headphones received under warranty.  No stars deducted.    UPDATE 7-18-11 These headphones broke twice since we received the replacement set.  The first time, I repaired it with duct tape. This time it looks like the patient is terminal.      The biggest problem in terms of construction is the hinge that connects the headband to the earcup is too delicate.  This part needs to be completely redesigned.      Due to repeated breakage, I'm lowering my rating to 3 stars.  Maybe that's a little too high.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I personnally enjoyed this book very much, Rick Riordan has yet to cease to amaze me. At first I thought that sense this would be a new book with new characters, Rick Riordan wouldn't have much to pull off since he already pulled the Kronos card. I also didn't think the new characters would be as colorful as he depicted it to be, in sort of speak. I mean, I originally thought that the new characters would be simple reflections of the old as in: Piper=Annabeth, Leo=Grover, and Jason=Percy, but they differ in too many different ways to have the same personality.    Now the downside. I honestly hated the weak elaboration between Thalia and Jason. I mean, Annabeth, Thalia, and Luke travelled together for years, right? You'd think the fact that she had a thought to be dead brother would be mentioned in some way, shape, or form. I also think the Roman side of the gods could have been more strongly portrayed, or rather \\"unlocked\\" instead of them always having Roman forms. I mean, the gods only NOW decide to reveal their Roman forms to camp half-blood? Seems to be a pretty weak link.    All-in-all, This is a great book and one of my favorites. I definitely recommend it to anyone.

0374531269|5.0|A Long Way Gone is the story of a rap-loving young boy growing up during civil war in Sierra Leone.  Under unimaginable conditions he was without his family, traveling with a pack of boys,  trying to survive.  While wandering the land, he never let himself be happy even when they found villages that would treat them to food and water - \\"It was much easier being sad than to go back and forth between emotions.\\"  He was then captured by the government army, given drugs and turned into a soldier at the age of 13.<br /><br />Some parts of this story were hard to read...he was so young and did not have an adult figure to care for him or guide him.  It is amazing that he was able to overcome all that he went through to become the man he is today.  He is truly an inspiration.
B00275EHJG|1.0|I was appalled by how dark, depressing and violent Toy Story 3 was.  We took our three young children to see it after hearing glowing reviews for the movie and getting good recommendations from a few other parents.  By the middle of the movie all three of our children were scared and crying, none of them liked it by the end, and two of them had nightmares afterward.    Whenever we watch a new animated kids movie, our kids almost always ask if we can buy it (as they've recently done with such movies as Tangled, How to Train Your Dragon, and Despicable Me), but they have never once asked to buy Toy Story 3, even though we own the first two already.  I am glad that we found out before we ordered the movie how bad it was.  The movie was filled with too much adult content inappropriate for children, but wrapped up in beloved characters and presented as fun for children.  I'm not surprised at this dark and terrifying theme coming from Disney - just look at Snow White and Sleeping Beauty - but I was surprised to find it in a Pixar collaboration.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is an excellent blade at a rock bottom price. The quality of the 1095 steel is amazing, and definitely the correct choice for a survival/camping knife. This steel takes an edge and retains it. Upon delivery, I sharpened the blade to a razor edge and then began carving some hardwood sticks. After about 30 minutes of carving I went back to check the edge, and sure enough it was as sharp as when I had began carving, and it slid through paper in one clean stroke. I also want to clarify that this blade came fairly sharp out of the factory, but I personally require a more finished edge on my knives.    The weight and balance of the knife is near perfect, and the handle fits comfortably in the hand with no hot spots. I would say that the balance of the knife is set more towards the blade, which makes it excellent for chopping and batoning, but not too unbalanced for finer control.    The sheath is not as bad as most make it out to be. It is certainly not perfect, but I like that the knife snaps in real tight and secure, even without fastening the top button. I am left handed, so I had to switch the side that the belt loop is fastened, which is easily done with a philips screw driver. One complaint is that the nylon belt loop is unnecessarily large and not well thought out, making for an awkward carry. I would have preferred a kydex belt clip as opposed to the loop, simply because it is more rugged and versatile. One other thing to note is that the sheath is prone to rub against the blade when inserting the knife. This can dull the blade, so it is important to slide the knife in at the correct angle to prevent this from happening. Another way to fix this is to take a straight file and rub away some of the material from inside the sheath. All-things-considered, the sheath functions just fine, and is easily customizable if you do not like the factory setup.       Well folks, this is one hell of a knife, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the outdoors. Wheitherit be camping, bushcraft, or an emergency survival situation--this knife can handle anything you throw at it, or throw it at. Buy now, enjoy immediately.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|Wow. Where to begin with this one. This is what American horror movies should strive for! The story, the acting, the cinematography... everything adds up here to nothing short of a horror masterpiece in my opinion. Let me start off by saying that this film is dark to the core and not for the casual movie fan... so if you're not on the adventurous side, don't even think about this one!<br /><br />Its so shocking and real because as you're watching you realize this could really happen... and probably has happened in some way in real life, which makes it all the more scary and shocking. The actual meaning of the events you see on screen aren't revealed until much later in the movie, but once they are the whole sick affair reveals a concept that should inspire endless discussion and pondering after the film is over. I really can't recommend this enough if you can take the extreme subject matter of the film. It's been a couple days after I've watched it and I still can't get it out of my head... shocking to the core; honestly one of the most hard hitting and conceptually brutal movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />It's one of the few films whose message and underlying plot are actually darker than the actual violence on screen (not that it's not violent, trust me there is plenty of brutal violence here). If you've forgotten what it feels like to be moved and emotionally jarred by a movie, here is the answer. Must see. 5/5 stars.

B002ZG98LO|3.0|If there had never been the other \\"predator\\" movies, this one would be good - like the original. But having seen the others, the similarities (plagiarism) is a bit too much, even parts of the soundtrack are the same. Character and dialog similarities too close; an alien wreck which will remind you of the derelect ship in \\"Alien\\". Similar circumstances and situations. WTF! Does it have to be copied so closely? Can't we even be a LITTLE original?    But enough new content to be interesting, if too many similarities. Still a good entertaining flick - I don't regret buying it and adding to my sci-fi/horror collection. Clearly some influence from the \\"cube\\" movies as well.    Interesting idea - being \\"kidnapped\\" and transported to an alien planet hunting park. That was the theme of one of the original \\"Outer Limits\\" episodes too.    The original \\"Predator\\" movie, like all such classics, can never be bested or even equaled; better to just do something entirely new instead. WHY CAN'T SOMEONE MAKE A GOOD SCI-FI HORROR MOVIE ANYMORE!? I find myself watching decades old classics over and over again .....
B0000C3I6U|5.0|I share the opinions of most of the reviewers here. I was very intrigued by this movie when I first saw it. Yes, it gives you amazingly interesting insight into the character of Arnold and his fellow body builders. Yes, it is filmed in an interesting way. Yes, it is witty and gritty. In sum, it is difficult to stop watching.    But, what I think many others are missing is that this is also a SPORTS movie. It is about preparation, training, competition, psyching-out opponents, mind games (big and small), sportsmanship (or lack thereof), the jitters, confidence, gloating, rubbing it in, dealing with defeat, etc. As a result, it is a movie not only for those interested in Arnold, or lifting, or body building. It is a movie for those who are interested in competition, motivation, effort and, of course, victory. Any fan of sports can find something in the movie about which to be impressed.    In addition, and very importantly IMHO, you do not come away from this work with the view that Arnold Schwarzenegger was a \\"natural\\" anything. He worked his fanny off and abused his body (at no small cost) to get to where he got. For that reason alone, I think it is a great film, highly recommended (despite its many warts) for young people who have idealized views of what it takes to make it big time in the world of professional sports. Nothing is free. Behind each victorious moment and every glamorous foray, there is world of very hard work.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|I saw this with friends after obsessing about the trailer for weeks. Needless to say, it was kind of amazing? I'm in love with Andrew Garfield's character (and him!) and Jesse Eisenberg is equally great. Rashida Jones' character is also very cool. Sorry for the awkward review, but I'd definitely buy this! You don't even have to be obsessed with Facebook to understand it. It's a fresh tale of the screwy friendship behind Facebook's inventor.
B0043ISH6O|5.0|A great, modern,  ambient music exploration presenting audio shaping produced by a variety of (sometimes) obscure instruments; with tracks either flowing  gracefully or pulsating rhythmically.  Love the variety.  Excellent background music for doing computer work, be it writing programs, paying bills; or simply, aimlessly, browsing the web.  I know these tracks help me to concentrate, which leads me to ponder whether or not the artists used various, masked, subliminal brain entraining frequencies to heighten the listener's creative genius, spurring us on to not only create something new, but also to reconfigure existing ideas together in a new way.  Great album which (as another reviewer stated), stands on its own.  You absolutely do not need to have seen the movie to enjoy owning this recording.      Many times, reviews on Amazon will also include mention of another, related piece of work.  I've been made aware of a lot of wonderful, different artists and recordings this way.  Recently, I found an entertaining single  recording, \\"[[ASIN:B004F8XZQO My Simple Request]]\\", which uses \\"Facebook\\" as its canvas to tell a story of obsession.  It's a fun one to share with family & friends, especially those exposed to social networks.
1401324029|2.0|Naked Heat isn't any better written than its predecessor, Heat Wave, but it's not any worse either. A gossip columnist is murdered and several celebrities are linked to her case. Detective Heat finds herself teamed up with writer and lover, Jameson Rook, once more and thankfully the plot is compelling enough to make it an O.K. read. There's not a lot of substance to the story, but the plot was interesting, and for fans of the show, it's easy to picture the characters. Overall though, I was more interested in the plot than anything else, and though it was a quick, light read, I wouldn't read it again.
1400052173|4.0|Here is a book composed of several different stories, some related only tangentially. It's the story of how a young woman died in 1951 of cervical cancer, and how the cells from her tumor were so aggressive and resilient that they were easy to grow in a laboratory, and so fecund that there are over 50 million tons of these cells in various labs throughout the world. It's also the story of how primitive, unethical and slipshod medical practice was only a few decades ago, of how doctors injected these cancer cells directly into healthy patients, an experiment which would seem to have as much scientific value and have been done in the same spirit as boys placing a cat into a microwave oven.<br /><br />Alas, most of the book takes-up the story of the deceased woman's descendants, and this is the least interesting part. Author Rebecca Skloot seems to have spent a lot of time with the family members, and she became so fond of them that she felt compelled to tell their mundane stories in detail. For those of us born into America's lower caste, there's nothing at all remarkable about their lives or circumstances. Their story is a common one, and I can attest to the fact that there are thousands of people in the Detroit area who had something to do with the wealth of music which has issued from this region over the years, but who received little or no compensation for their work, while the white-owned music industry continues to profit each time this music is played. What makes the Lacks family so special in this regard?<br /><br />I'm puzzled as to why this book has received such acclaim, since the story of Henrietta Lacks and her perpetually-proliferating cancer cells has been told many times before, as have the other stories in this book. Ms. Skloot does, however, deserve praise for a part of the book some readers may not have made it to, and that's her \\"Afterword,\\" a concise but detailed discussion of the tissue-property controversy.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|Prequel (I-III) set = 3 discs   Original (IV-VI) set = 3 discs   Complete Saga set = 6 discs + 3 bonus discs = 9 discs total (best deal)     Total bonus features according to bluray.com = 30 hours. Maybe Lucas can throw in clips of Clone Wars and Ewok Adventure in the extras.     An original (1977 theatrical) release would be nice. But Lucas says 1997 is the better version, as he intended with the updates more consistent w/ the prequel storyline. He also states it's more feasible to clean up the relatively cleaner 1997 in achieving the best high def results, than to go backwards to remaster the 1977 print aging in a warehouse archive for 34+ years.  Besides, we do have the original already: the dvd (2004 limited ed.) and laser disc. Maybe we can at least ask that the deleted parts from the original be placed in the bonus section (a more reasonable request). He has `til Sept `11 to consider our demands. However, any push by Lucas/Fox, would probably opt in the direction for 3D release (going forwards, not backwards).     Considering Peter Jackson's LOR trilogy marketing gouging (and failure), would it be worth waiting around years for the other version, and then pay double, to cover the costly blu clean up of 2 separate prints? And unless blu ray players have the technology to select different versions on the same disc, for now we'd have to grit our teeth and embrace this as Lucas' complete, final, and only blu release of SW.

0743454537|4.0|but that's not saying much.    I knew there would be a \\"twist\\" to the end of this book because of a bonehead reviewer who mentioned that something would happen at the end, but I didn't know exactly what it would be. Unlike another reviewer, the very last part of the book earned my review another star.    This is the fourth or fifth Picoult book I have read so I knew that there would be different point of views (and fonts), emotional crises, and an After-School Special Disease-of-the-Week. There would be a big trial towards the end, and many characters would be lawyers.    Campbell's service dog's function was teased through the book, as I knew it would be. I enjoyed the \\"reveal\\" when it finally happened.    What brought this all together is the skill with which Picoult fleshes out her outline. I will be reading more of her books soon.
B000Y7U98C|2.0|I don't buy the premise of this movie. Why would so much resources be expended to create a pleasant and spacious crew area when they're not needed in the first place? Send a remote bomb. In order to save the mission, the crew always goes with their first solution (which usually entails somebody getting sacrificed).    Other problems: there is no sound or gravity in space. Why would a modern sci-fi movie forget this?    It also rips off better films like: 2001 A Space Odyssey, Outland, Silent Running, Solaris, Alien and Aliens.    Good special effects (if you can follow the action).    [DW]

B00005N6KG|1.0|I've worn Philips turbo bass heandband headphones for years while running and for hours at work.  Their new design is excruciatingly uncomfortable so I needed to look elsewhere.  Ordered these since the reviews were good and they were inexpensive.      Very disappointed.  These are very cheaply made and the sound is horrible.  Very flimsy, and I don't believe they'd hold up well.  You get what you pay for.    However, I also ordered Sony MDR-AS35W headphones ($25-$30) to try as well.  I highly recommend paying the extra money for those - well worth it.  Good sound quality (comparable to Turbo bass) and extremely comfortable.  I've worn mine all day at work for a couple of weeks.  I'll be order more of those.

0670034711|1.0|Is this book supposed to be a paraody?  Horrible example of our pop culture today. Ranks up there as bad Americana with Snookie and Sex and The City.  Shoddy over sexed women relishing in their own private movies playing in their heads.     I'm not sure why i read this, because my sister said the Gilbert character is awful. So i had to read it for myself. I was very interested after seeing the back and forth on how great or not so great the story was. It seems too me that the people who disliked the book had a whole lot more to say than those who enjoyed it. The cons by far seemed more intelligent and thought out vs. the pros who were trite, and juvenile reviews.     Expecting the worst i read the book and came to the same conclusion why most of the other well educated people bored this book very quickly.      This is not a believable story of a real woman.     I know what a real woman is, my sister  is a mother of 3 , A Captain in the United States Army (superior to 1200 soldiers) and travels/flys across the world for pleasure and business, she should know a thing or two about the subjects in this book. My sister and I have personally been to all these locations as well (our mother is from Italy and father is from Indonesia), so reading about our family home land like its an amusement park is kind of trite.     Let me tell you, when i saw the replies from other readers saying  how shallow and un-spiritual men are, I just had to call them out here. REALLY come on, the bible was written by men. Jesus was a man. 90% of churches are run my men. How can the whole male gender be un-spiritual? ANYWAYS.....     Sad part is that this narcissistic journey of some privileged upper class woman, actually closely represents the reality of many women i know. Women that i  steer far - far away from. I doubt I know a successful man who would be interested in such a wretch of a woman as the character in this book. NARCISSISM turns real men OFF!    My expectation is that the women who identify and like this kind of book, either are lost wandering souls looking to identify them selves through the men who they have relationships with (co-dependent), or are completely self centered like the TV reality stars we see on the networks today (borderline personality).     My current girlfriend is a school teacher, she travels with me often and she is grateful for everything we have in our lives and for the luxury's we are given in this country when so many in the world are going with out.    This book is either little more than a juvenile fantasy, a crummy a piece of pulp fiction, or better yet a soap opera with a single female character in the story (a character i would hardly call a woman).    Please reconsider if you want to buy this book, it exemplifies our societies shallow \\"look-at-me\\" facebook culture has take over our female gender today. There is much better fiction available  out there.    Parting thoughts:    Thinking as i carelessly thew the cheap $5 paperback i got a garage sale into the recycle bin, that its too bad, i'm sure a kid in Uganda could have eaten for a week on that wasted $5. Hope it becomes toilet paper in its next life, probably would sever humanity better.    REAL WOMEN are capable of making tough decisions and standing up for themselves in the face of adversity, they don't whine and the definitely don't throw in the towel on their families and run away to never never land.

B0000029LG|5.0|In the 90's Michael Jackson was the s***! History is actually the first album I ever owned by him. It was given to me by dad when I was only 5 and boy did I listen to it a lot! I love it even more as an adult who understands what every songs about. You have Billy Jean, Bad, Thriller, a bunch of classic MJ songs in 2 CD's. There also his best songs (minus about 2, but even their great to listen to).  Because 99.9% of the world knows MJ's music is the s***, I'm going to talk about a few songs that were actually new to me or that I found unusual on the album.<br /><br />The most unusual song on here is definitely Little Susie. Seriously. This song scared me even as an adult. It's about the murder of a little girl, whose death is described as irreverent to everyone around her. It's really creepy. The song starts with this orchestrated piece that last a few minutes, followed by the humming of a little girl to a windup box, then the orchestra becomes intense and loud. I wonder if it's based off a true story.<br /><br />Then there's Come Together which is a cover of an old Beatles song. There's this huge debate on YouTube on which version is better (Heck which artist is better. Yeah people on there are stupid sometimes), but I personally prefer MJ's. The Beatles version is good. I love the Bass and how smooth sounding it is, but I love how faster pace MJ's version is. Plus I grew up on MJ and never really knew about The Beatles until I was older.<br /><br /> Next is Stranger in Moscow. This is definitely one of my favorite songs on the second disc. You want to know what's cool? There's a chance that this, Jam, and Thriller might have been inspiration for the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Knuckles soundtrack. Just go on YouTube and look at comparisons. There's a chance MJ might have did the music for the game which is just awesome!<br /><br /> I can't forget to mention Too Bad, Money, and Scream which were remixed on his Blood on the Dance floor album. I prefer these original versions. Some of you might also remember Too Bad from MJ's Ghost video. Scream is a fabulous duet with Sister Janet Jackson. The video is 100 times more awesome. Its ashamed him and Janet never did more songs together.  I heard that the video itself is one of the most expensive videos in the 90's. I'm going to look it up later. Money is a great piece of music. It basically talks about how people will do anything for money, including selling their souls to the devil!XD  Very clear message.<br /><br /> History is probably one of my least favorites. That's not necessarily a bad thing though. It's just one of those songs I won't listen to that often. I think it's supposed to be talking about solders at war and patriotism, but don't take my word for it.<br /><br /> Shes Out of My Life. Very beutiful song. The Girl Is Mine. This is definately an interesting song. Just like Say,Say, Say this is a duet with Paul McCartney who also has a great voice! It was also on his Thriller album. At the time this song was fairly new to me because this is literally the first song I ever heard by MJ featuring Paul. I didn't even know who Paul was until I discovered Say, Say, Say. Apparently the Black Eyed Peas actually covered this song and \\"ruined\\" it. Time to go on Youtube. I don't mind covers, just as long as it sounds good and respects the original artist it came from. -10 minutes later- Hmmmm...Actually I don't think its too bad. Its better than a certain other cover I heard recently on Youtube by a certain group(coughGanstasparadise-InFearandFaithcough). I also can't forget the cover of Prince's Darling Nikki by Foo Fighters, but to each his own.<br /><br /> Smile is definately my least favorite. Its the only song on the album I never go to because it just not my type of songXD<br /><br /> The songs Tabloid Junkie and This Time Aound are extremely catchy songs. I think Just like Leave Me Aline thier about how the media always butt themselves into his life and make up stories. Im 100%about Tabloid junkie is about, but not too sure if This Time Around is the same story.<br /><br /> I could go on and on about every song on this CD, but it'll take pages. History is definitely my favorite MJ album. It's a collection of the greatest songs Michael Jackson has ever made (minus a few). Some the greatest songs ever made period. Every song is so different that it just shows Michael Jackson really is a musical genius.Around is the same story.     I could go on and on about every song on this CD, but it'll take pages.

B002ZG98Z0|2.0|The video tape arrived in good condition, and the quality is fine.  The movie however, is boring, with a weak plot line.  Expected more of this film.  Not a reflection of the sale but I had not seen this movie prior to the video, and I was disappointed.
B00474IVGA|4.0|I have not bought the soundtrack yet. I was looking it up online and noticed that \\"Give in to me\\" is not sang by Leighton Meester and Garrett Hedlund. That is really upsetting. I saw the movie today and it was awesome. Garrett has a great country voice and it was one of my favorite songs from the movie.  If you see the movie then you know the significance of the duet and I just do not understand why Faith Hill is singing it on the soundtrack and not them. I feel a little let down :(

0879309210|5.0|When I got my first guitar in 1984 I also got a copy of the most recent Guitar Player magazine. Inside that magazine was a column by Dan Erlewine on guitar repair and maintenance. That column turned out to be the most valuable of all the ones in the magazine. Over the next year, reading Dan's column inspired me to want to learn more about the instrument, how to set it up, repair, maintain and even customize my cheap electric guitar. Over the years, I have built and repaired many guitars for local bands and musicians and the most valuable resources that I have in my library are the magazines with Dan's columns, books he has written and videos he has published. This book is the bible for anyone that wants to know the proper way to string a guitar, stretch strings, tweak and maintain the instrument. I bought this book again to give to my 18 year-old nephew who is interested in helping his friends maintain their instruments and to learn more about them. After just a couple of days of thumbing through it, he told me it was the best book he had ever seen on the guitar. This is the most comprehensive book you will find on this subject and I have bought and read almost all of them. Even if, like me, you own the first or second editions of this book YOU MUST have this edition as well. It has so much more information in it that you will refer back to it no matter how long you work on or play guitar.    Dan works for Stewart-MacDonald Guitar Supply (stewmac.com) and publishes a newsletter called Trade Secrets, which is a wonderful appendix to this book. They also have most of the parts and tools that you need to work on guitars. If you only get one book to learn about taking care of your guitar - THIS IS THE BOOK YOU NEED!
B003XKPPOU|4.0|This was a great movie. I will say though that the mood of this movie overall is pretty dark. My little girl, who adores the other two films, had a look of concern rather than enjoyment on her face for a good portion of the film. She asked a lot of questions about why characters in the film where \\"being mean\\", and she frequently told the screen \\"no thank you!\\". While I got a chuckle out of that, I think I'm going to wait a year or so before I show it too her again.
B002ZG974M|5.0|A lot of people are writing about the cultural aspects of this film, of the differences and similarities between the babies. Lots of well thought out (and correct reviews,) none of which contain the reason I gave it 5 stars.  My 18-month old daughter LOVES this movie. Right now we play it pretty much nonstop in our house.  She laughs at it, she claps and squeals, she stands on her tiptoes in front of the TV during her favorite parts (and Mommy gets to sneak into the kitchen and do dishes or pick-up the toys that are strewn around the living room or just sit for five minutes.)
B004529NLG|5.0|If you were turned off by Step Up, forget about it, the sequels are infinitely better. This movie is so good! One of the things that I love about it is that the dancers may be quirky or awkward in plot scenes, but when they'e dancing they are so powerful and confident, it's like they become superheroes (moose in particular).<br />Step up 3 makes the right decision to cut down on plot and drama and let the dancing take the spotlight. Yes there is a story, but it's not bogged down by disapproving parents or stodgy ballet instructors. Everyone starts out as good dancers so there aren't any unnecessary montages of bad dancers fumbling around (though there are some great training sequences of everyone showing off). The conflicts are sometimes so ludicrous it's hilarious. The acting is fine, these are fantasy people who live in beautiful colorful world where conflicts are settled with dance battles in the bathroom, they're charming and happy go lucky and I wouldn't want it any other way.<br />The dancing is amazing! There are so many styles and every dancer injects their own personality into it. The interactions between crews during battles were really interesting. They'll trade blows and react to each others moves and sometimes mock the other crews style. They really made an effort to resolve plot in the dancing instead of having plot and dancing separate. The choreography is stellar and the cinematography is significantly improved since Step Up 2. It's really bright and colorful and the contrast and framing allows for you to see all the intricacies of the choreography.  I particularly appreciated that the dancing can be flirty without being sexual or vulgar.<br /><br />I just go through this movie with a huge grin on my face and the battles are great to watch over and over. I just can't get enough of this movie.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that I would like to have a commentary or more special features with the director talking about his process. He obviously loves and knows dance, and he is pretty vocal on the internet so I was surprised that he didn't talk more on the features.and he is pretty vocal on the internet so I was surprised that he didn't talk more on the features.
B002ZG98LO|5.0|For those who loved Predator 1, but didn't really care much for Predator 2 (sorry Danny Glover)- DON'T pass this one up! This is not like the first sequel at all, but rather it is a great story that stays true to the Predator series.  It starts off with a bang and a big surprise, and just keeps getting better after that!    If you're a Predator fan you won't be disappointed and sure won't want to miss it...

B003LSTK8G|3.0|I just started the book today and i already got annoyed at something and wanted to share. Ok, related to Vincent Daniel, Mr. Lewis attributes Mr. Daniel to saying that based on his work as a first year auditor he was unable to grasp the basis for certain assets and was unable to be satisfied with his supervisors responses, and therefore did not feel the company was auditable. Mr. Lewis did not qualify that thought or in any way put the comments into perspective. Mr. Daniel was a new hire from college without a background in the entity he was auditing. Yes his supervisors should have given him a better history of the entity to perform his tasks, i agree, but in no way did Mr. Daniel have the experience to make that determination. I've worked with many new hires and essentially I consider the first year a success if they show up to work every day on time listen carefully so that next year they can be a contributing member of the team. My thought is that Mr. Daniel was exercizing his intellectual curiousity, which is a good attribute, but with tight budgets and time frames sometimes tackling the task you are assigned to do takes precedence over understanding the big picture. That function is for experienced team member who have earned that responsibility. I just want to clear up that in the right circumstances many more knowledgeable people within that field would feel differently about the auditability of these entities.    Sometimes I wonder why i read these historical reflections which seem to regergitate public information, add a few personal stories from the pool of the 10 billion people effected by the calamity and draw a going forward conclusion which never gets revisited to put the authors forecasting ability on record. Then make a film about it, entertain people and move on the the next big thing.
0307341569|4.0|I was thoroughly intrigued by the premise of this novel...a club that meets regularly to rehash crimes and in the process of doing so glorifies the dark corners of what human beings can be. The author's prose was evocative and inspired; I enjoyed the way she described things in such a way that was twisted, lush, and yet concise all at the same time. The dichotomy of good and evil is played out in full to a rapt audience of club members - they can't get enough.     The narrator, Libby Day, teeters on being unbelievable at times but in the end the almost heavy-handed characterization works. The story ends up being bleak and haunting. There is a twist at the end that caught me by surprise and it worked quite well.
B0000549B0|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a kid and kept meaning to buy it once DVD's were invented(yes I am OLD) anyhow, its a heartwarming and funny tale and its something the whole family can watch with no embarassment and though its an old black and white film movie( some of the best ones are) its timeless in its application of human reactions and life situations.  Yes you can tell it was made long ago, and yet, it surprisingly is fresh and very focused on the human condition which never really changes.  In the end, you are always wondering, did he exist? or was it just a mental aberration?  I like that the film makers left that to it's audience.  Its about a magical puka ( Harvey) a 6ft tall rabbit who accompanies a man of many complexities, though he seems simple, he is clearly deep and thoughtful.  I only wish I knew someone like that and even if they did have questionable mental state, what a pleasant person to be around. Jimmy Stewart was a great actor and though gone, never forgotten, this was to me, clearly one of his best efforts.  Get it and enjoy, I know I did.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|SPOILER ALERT. so i started read the series after they were all out and i borrowed the first from my friend and since it was close to christmas i decided to hold off on the second and third and get the trilogy box set for christmas. christmas night i dived rite into catching fire and i finished it the next day. after catching fire and hunger games being so awesome and amazing i had high expectations for mockingjay.     starting mockingjay i took it sloow becaue i just did not want it to end. but also beacuse the story was slow. it starts out in district 13 and you meet presient coin and katniss refuses to be there mockingjay(face of the rebellion) and then she gives in and the story takes off from there. they get peeta back ona rescue missiom but hes been brainwashed to hte katniss and they get all the districts to break away and they invade the capitol.     basically towards the end katniss leads this group of i think 8 on a mission to assassinate president snow. with them is gale peeta and finnik and some other characters. basically only like katniss gale peeta and i think two others make it back.     but this is what just is harsh. these whole books where about katniss protecting her little siser yet the author kills her off. and this jjust breaks katniss and shes like lost the will to live almost.     now later she finds out tha coin was the cause of her sisters death and while shes about to kill snow becaue hes been sentenced to death she aims the arrow at coin!! which was awesome beacuse i hated her and she deserved to die. but at the end katniss is with peeta and they end up having two kids but katniss and peeta will never be the same agian. soo this was a breif breif breif telling of what happes theres so much more and its so much more complicated. but ya i dont know if im completely satisfied with the ending. idk. all in all really good book series. sad that theres no more tho:((

B002ZG98C8|2.0|A former Federale (Trejo) who has lost everything has been double crossed and must now fight to stay alive in Robert Rodriguez's latest \\"Grindhouse\\" offering.  I will admit going in the only reason I wanted to watch this was because De Niro was in it and it seemed like a strange choice for him.  After sitting through this I decided to send him 5 bucks...he obviously needs the money if this is the kind of work he is taking.  At the risk of losing money and comments I may receive, this movie was lame.  The best explanation I can give is that it's 1 hour and 45 minutes of blood splatters mixed with some nudity.  I like a good mindless flic now and then but this was just bad.  It's hard to comment on the acting, it has an all-star cast including Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez, Don Johnson, Steven Seagal, Cheech and Lindsay Lohan, but the writing was so bad even De Niro seemed like a B rate actor.  I am sure many of you will absolutely love this movie, but for me it was very lame and the worst movie I've seen since Macgruber.  I give it a D-.

B003Q6D1YW|4.0|A documentary about a man (Nev) who starts a relationship with a woman he meets on facebook, and starts to wonder how truthful this person is.  If you watch the trailer for this movie it is very misleading, not to say its a bad movie but it's not at all what I expected.  This is a true life account that I'm sure has happened to many people.  An 8 year old girl named Abby starts to send Nev paintings she has done after seeing a picture Nev took in a newspaper.  Out of that Nev begins to talk with Angela (Abby's mom) and it carries over to Megan (Abby's sister).  After quickly falling in love with Megan, Nev soon discovers Megan may not be who she says she is and plans a trip to visit her and find out the truth.  Every once in a while a movie comes along that you just have to keep watching and your not sure why, and when it's over your not sure why it had this grip on you, this is one of those movies.  This is not for everyone, being that it is a documentary and slow in parts, but it is very interesting and has an ending that sneaks up on you and affects you in a way you can't explain. At least it did to me. I give it a B-
1439152780|5.0|As she did in \\"The Forgotten Garden,\\" Kate Morton has taken a piece from a classic novel and built an entirely new story around it, with intriguing characters and back and forth changes from modern time settings to the years of World War II.  This time machine technique builds the suspense as the mysteries twist and then unfold until all the questions are answered.  I have to admit that I expected one aspect of the ending almost from the beginning, but I was not in the least disappointed by  the journey.<br /><br />I look forward to more from Kate Morton.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|As much as I respect everyone's opinions and try to tolerate all of the quibbling reviews on here, this is just one ongoing debate/arguement that never ceases to end or stop annoying me.  Do I think the originals should be included just to appease the die-hard & [really] old-schools fans? Yes.  Do I care if they're not included? No.  No I don't love every little thing that's been added, however I do appreciate him cleaning up some of the special effects - so I don't let those things bother me.  I don't agree that every change he made was for the better, but it's a great saga - deal with it.  Once he's made up his mind he's likely not going to change it over a bunch of negative amazon reviews.    To add onto what another reviewer wrote, if you prefer the originals in their 'original' state then you prefer their 'original and poorer' quality.  And if that's the case, why do you need these on bluray?  They already exist on dvd, so just get those *and* save yourself some cash.

030726999X|2.0|I couldn't put down the first two books in the trilogy, but this one took me a long time to finish. In my opinion, the book only gets good about 3/4 of the way through when the story starts focusing on Lisbeth rather than the array of other characters (whom I had trouble keeping straight). The ending is great---it just takes way too long to get to the good parts.  Most of the book is dull and lacks the nonstop suspense of the other two.

0061119776|5.0|I love that this book is offered in a big book edition for kids.  My son loves this book and when I found it in large print I knew we had to have it.  He is three years old and has a brain tumor on his optic nerves which makes him somewhat visually impaired and the size of the book has helped him tremendously.  Since getting this in the large print he now is able to identify the objects the story refers to, whereas he couldn't in the small print.  We hope other books will be offered in this format also!
B00192IV9U|3.0|Michael is gone, and there won't be any new songs from him. I can deal with them not being 100% and I appreciate the work that went into making these half complete songs sound complete. There's a lot of good songs on here but I'm still upset that it's obvious some are not exactly Michael. As a music producer I can tell Michael's vocals, what's been altered and what they did to mix it in. The singer they got is a good singer but he should be making songs under his own name. It's obvious to any MJ fan to know MJ's music style by heart and some of the songs you can tell MJ would never do. Especially the 50cent rap duet? are you freaking kidding me? and what's with that \\"Michael Jackson\\" breaking news? I don't think I can remember a single song where Michael spoke about himself revealing who he was directly. Tabloid Junkie? Leave me alone? Scream? all those were about his battles with the media don't remember him saying his name why would he now. The vocals are different.  I thought at first maybe they just overlayed them with someone elses but nah it's a completely different singer with MJ highlighting certain parts. Really Really Really dirty! I think most fans would appreciate it and respect if they just came out and said here's Michael's Unreleased tracks. There's only like 5-6 of them but hey...THIS IS IT! and I'm quite sure people would still buy it I know I would! Instead to complete an album quota or to complete songs they tarnish Michael's vocals by recording tricks give me a break why would you do that? Your not going to fool people that have been listening to Michael since birth.<br /><br />Anyway I give it 5 stars for the real tracks I get to hear Michael again on but 3 stars overall for the Music industry bs.<br /><br />btw I know that's you Jason Malachi that gave me a not helpful vote! Screw you buddy! I want my money back!
B000P12LWY|2.0|If you like your Henry VIII with the mentality of a spoiled rock star or NFL player, then this series will be okay for you. While his advisors run the ship of state, this Henry is busy hustling the court groupies and tearing up hotel (er, castle) rooms. Although intelligent and subtle performances are turned in by the actors who play supporting roles such as Thomas Moore and Cardinal Wolsey, this version of Henry could never have separated from Rome to form the first secular nation in the Christian world. He cares far more about chasing booty and jousting and running his dogs than picking up a book or a treaty and actually sitting down to think (and behave) like the most cunning and significant king of his time.
B0041T52S6|3.0|I couldn't stop thinking \\"NO MORE HEROES\\" and how the main character just wants to kill all the assassins he can so he can be #1 so he can score a date. The bad guys even turn into change when they die...well all except for the main villains but whatever. On top of that it's filled with video game references, over the top bosses with strange super powers that the main hero can't understand...and this all happens while he is doing this in a game but he is oblivious to the fact that his life is like a game. Now that I think more about it I'm surprised Suda51 didn't sue the creators of this movie... too many coincidences. Not to mention ***spoiler here*** the main Villain is also the head of the corporation (well in this movie he's just a successful mogul) that put everything together. Kind of like how Pizza Bat is the end boss and creator of the Assassin tournament and also the head of a large corporation. I guess as I watched this film I couldn't help but think.. wait... wait.. why do I have a feeling I've seen something like this before.<br /><br />Well anyway...<br /><br />This movie was pretty good but it just didn't hit that perfect mark with me like most other reviews I guess. The action was fun, the game references were fine, the band idea and music was fantastic BUT, I think the reason why I didn't like this movie so much was because I didn't think Ramona was anything special or even worth fighting over. There just didn't seem to be any type of chemistry between them other than for whatever reason Scott just decided he wanted a chance at being her boyfriend.<br /><br /> For the most part I thought Knives was the better chick and more the GF type worth fighting over. She apparently cared about Scott all Ramona seemed to care about was herself. The ending was almost good until it gave me the finger. Maybe I played to many videogames and it's warped my mind but I don't understand why Scott Pilgrim wanted this average looking chick with colored hair so badly. What about her was so amazing? Her bland personality and loud fashion style? Her screwed up past to match how confused she was about her present self? I don't get it?<br /><br />Scott Pilgrim is such a dorky guy how is he getting these girls anyway? They all seem out of his league and he seems like the type that would be lead around by a leash and get walked on.<br /><br />Just those parts of the movie that didn't leave me raving over me because it didn't seem so realistic. I know that's expecting a lot from a film like this but the characters should at least be believable on that level since this is about romance.<br /><br />I don't think I'd even fight the bus man for Romona let alone 7 people she's not worth it. She kind of reminds me of those women who have like 10 ex boyfriends and have been around the world thrice and they are like 25 and sound like a woman that's 54 with all their baggage. I mean woa! who wants that. I'm looking for something brand new off the lot with low miles (Like Knives) I don't want something that's been worn to hell and doesn't even come with a 3 year warranty. That's not the type of woman you go chasing after unless your that desperate.<br /><br />Overall nice film worth watching a few times to catch everything lots of good action. Story completely not feasible for the reasons previously stated but if you can let your mind go I think you can enjoy it.azing? Her bland personality and loud fashion style?

0811876373|4.0|I bought this book & found it to be wonderful. The designs are cute & look to be easy to do. I have not tried making these but it is on my list. In reading the instructions, it appears they are easy to make.
B000KQGOA4|5.0|As a Mars Society life member I wanted to listen to Mars The Bringer of War. So far I have only been able to listen to this CD in my truck going back and forth to work. I have a better than average sound system for the truck and the first track Mars the Bringer of war knocked my socks off. You actual feel the approaching cataclysm of approaching war by the brass section.<br /><br />Gustav Holst 1874-1934 wrote a musical score for all the planets but Earth and Pluto. His best was Mars the Bringer of War. Venus the Bringer of Peace track 2 was good putting me to sleep music...indeed very peaceful.<br />Mercury the Winged Messenger was good but INM0 a little too \\"impish\\". Jupiter the Bringer of Jollity was very good but IMNO more power should of been shown as the king of the gods. Saturn The Bringer of old Age was very good as was Uranus the Magician. Neptune The Mystic was part eerie, strange and wonderful.Holst showed no interest in including Pluto in this set. Why? Pluto had been discovered in his life time.<br /><br />Herbert von Karajan  conductor and the Vienna Philharmonic were spectacular.The violins, and horns were most effective. The other instruments were great too. Karajan was obvious a master.<br /><br />Next was Don Juan by Richard Strauss... excellent. In my minds eye with my eyes closed listening to the CD ( stopped at work parking lot) I can see the swash buckler, ladies man, fighter, killer and than  dieing.<br /><br />I really can't say anything bad about this CD. Glad I bought it. If you like classical epic big orchestra music this CD is a must have. Just Mars the Bringer of War was worth the price. This CD 5 stars and worth every penny.<br /><br />I ordered a Bose Wave music system with the CD player. I can't wait to hear this CD on a better music system than my trucks music sytem.<br /><br />P.S. Jan 7. Just hooked up my new Bose Wave radio and listened to the Planets CD. Much better than the truck CD player/speakers. Absolutely superior. Felt like I was at the orchestra. My favorite Mars Bringer of War was incredible. My second favorite Jupiter was great too as was all tracks of the CD. Great CDf War was incredible. My second favorite Jupiter was great too as was all tracks of the CD. Great CD
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|Ugh.<br /><br />I was completely disinterested in the loser characters.<br />The monster is kind of stupid.<br />They all die in the end.<br /><br />But it was watchable, kind of.  When I got bored I accelerated it to 1.5 or 5 speed.<br /><br />It's a lot better than a 1 rated move, because those are jokes.  This is just over hyped, and not that good.
B003I55BIA|5.0|\\"Perfect Chemistry\\": AMAZING! I can honestly say this is currently my favorite book ever. So much romance. I know this sounds weird, but for those of you who can relate you'll know what I'm talking about, Alex is freaking sexy in this book. You'll put yourself in Brittany's place, and if you're a daydreamer like me, you'll think about it for weeks after you're done reading. Read you guys, I'm serious. I was skeptical reading others reviews because I personally want to find out for myself, but I am soooooo glad I bought this book. YOU MUST, MUST, MUST READ IT.
1607050072|5.0|This is a fun, cute, whimsical book. If you like birds and trees and houses and the like, you will love this book. Just get it!
B00009W0U4|1.0|It would be very hard for anyone who values the dignity of mankind to find any entertainment or viewing value to this effort to popularly expose some of the worst in human behavior. It is a true barometer of civil devolution that this is even quasi mainstream. Where can someone that does not want to be exposed to this and the freaks that value this human waste go? Why are these disturbed people allowed to expose our culture to this? This is toxic waste that needs to be cleaned up. Where is the outrage? It is a true measure of society in how much degeneracy they tolerate and promote. Why do the producers of this crap garner any attention whatsoever? There is a corrupt core in the distribution system that promotes this. It is intensional corrosion of society. Shameful.
B0021L8V0W|3.0|Ok. This movie has total action with a plot. The CIA thinks Salt is gonna assisinate our President. Did she really want to do the ultimate crime? Find out for yourself! Salt is a russian spy who wants to kick everyone's ass that gets in her way to think she's protecting her own country of Russia that led me believe that she's a villain. Salt is very clever as she evades those two top CIA operatives whom they're trying to capture but she's too fast for them.Tough break for them! This movie has a lot of potential in which Philip Noyce the director tried to make a real good story out of it but may had failed in some points in the movie. Some things don't make any sense like why did she really run away from the CIA when she says that she's not a russian spy? SHe could've told and proved to them that she's not who she really is. So why? You can try to figure that out for yourself after you watch the movie.     Anyway this movie is worth a rental. Or if you love action that much then it's worth a purchase.    On the side note, Angelina is some big action star ever since Tomb Raider and I do admire her skills. She impressess me alot sometimes.I give credit for her hard work.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout is crazy!  All three levels are super challenging and will change your body.  START AT LEVEL ONE!!!!!  I started at level 1 and it killed me.  I've been feeling sore for days, but it's good sore because I can feel and start seeing the changes in my body.  The only drawback is that there are only three workouts.  I wish Jillian makes more 20 min workouts.  AWESOME! You can do it.
0316069485|3.0|Like many other people have written on here i thoroughly enjoy Connelly's writing.  I read the lincoln lawyer about a year ago and really enjoyed it.  It was up there with the best books ive ever read.  I really enjoy books with the characters carried over from other books.  So i researched a little and found out that brass verdict had the same main characters.  I recently finished that and have to say that it too was very good.  Tough to put down and was really a great book.      I just finished the reversal and have to say that i am slightly disappointed.  After reading the two previous books i mentioned i felt that this book wasnt as good as the other two.  I enjoy the procedure and the journey leading up the the ending.  I know that although the ending sometimes isnt that great the build up to it is often very good and that was the case with this book.  I was on the edge of my seat and couldnt manage to put it down after the first 150 pages.  However, i predicted what i thought would be the outcome and as i got further into the story i realized that i was going to be correct.      I was at page 368 out of 388 and thinking \\"where is the end because their arent a lot of pages left.\\"  I felt like the ending was just thrown in and although it was mostly developed throughout the story it just felt like the ending was rushed.  No real surprises to what i expected to happen.  As i have read other reviews most other people also knew how it would end.    I would have liked to see a twist in the ending.  I think if this had occurred i would give this five stars and it would be on my list of best books ever read.  Overall though a great book that is definitely worth reading.    If anyone is interested i would highly recommend Nelson Demille books including Lions Game, Plum Island, Nightfall and The Lion.  These all share the same main characters about a police investigator.  I guarantee you wont be disappointed if you decide to read these books.  I recommend them to everyone i talk to because they are my favorite books to date.
B001SGEUMY|5.0|I bought this on a whim as I love their earlier stuff. The first time my wife and I heard it, we said to each other, \\"this album is great! And it gets even better the more one listens. We like all the songs, the ones written by the other band members are just as good as Noel's. Liam sounds in top form, great guitar work as usual, and it's a fun album. If you're an Oasis fan, you won't regret buying this.
B002RI9PKO|4.0|I think it's a 4 star, but I specially recommend the chapters about violinists, airplane accidents, child education, and Asian rice farmers. Great examples of the point the author wants to make.
B002QE3CTY|1.0|Don't waste your time or money. Poor character development, repetitive, unrealistic behavior for teen boys no matter what situation they're in. (Every boy I know would have quickly been using those weapons to attack the stupid monsters.) Too many unresolved questions and unexplored possibilities, even for a series starter, with a disappointing and obvious ending. If you want to read a dystopian novel then get The Hunger Games which is compelling and vivid.
0393068382|5.0|Delusions of Gender is all I had hoped it would be - and I've been waiting for a book like this for years.  With all the popular nonsense about men thinking one way and women thinking another way, this book gets down to the roots of gender: infant and child rearing within a societal framework.  It busts myths left and right, from pink being feminine and blue being masculine, to girls being bad at math relative to boys.  The detailed footnotes and literature references really shine, so that people reading the book can do their homework more easily if they wish to challenge its conclusions.
B002ZG993Q|5.0|The American is not a fancy movie with a lot of glitter that is in movies these days. Glitter I define as fancy glamorous sets and location shoots. This movie is about as real as it gets in a CIA/Assassin world. If you watch the \\"Special Features\\" you will understand why the movie was made and then you will truly appreciate it even more. Great movie to watch. Five Stars for its originality.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Must admit that I have not come across a LMAO show from the US for a long time, until TBBT. Now totally addicted to it. It was an eye opener as I have worked with so many engineers and each one has a little Sheldon in them, it is really great writting and acting. The cast is well placed and every episode gives a good lol moment.
B000U7169M|2.0|As a Christian myself an movie that mentions God or uses the Bible in any way I don't feel too comfy about, because more than likely they'll put doubts into peoples minds.....Was the \\"Science of the 7 plagues on the DVD extra really necessary?\\" Science and the Bible go together like peanut butter and cheese, you can eat it...but why?<br /><br />I love Hilary Swank, love the effects...confused about the message of the film. They bring Hilary back into believing in God, but only after she puts doubts into everyone's mind.<br /><br />Honestly I was half asleep when i watched it, film started off incredibly on the slow side. Also some bad acting by some.
0439023521|5.0|I've been looking for a new series to get into, that would hold my attention, and this was it! This story pulled me in from the first page, and I found myself reading until I couldn't keep my eyes open any longer. In The Hunger Games, Katniss is very strong willed. She doesn't give up and puts others before herself, and since this is a young adult book, I think a female lead like that is needed.    Although I gave this book 5 stars, I do have some minor complaints. I would have loved to see this story be longer. (I have read all 3 of the books, but I am referring to The Games themselves). I would have liked to see a bit more character development for Katniss and Gale. Otherwise, I think this story was amazing.

193413712X|4.0|Tinkers is about dying, and what it means to live. The story is told while George Crosby lies dying in his living room, fading away, with his family crowding around. Interwoven with the story of his passing, and reflections on George's past, we learn about George's epileptic father Harold.<br /><br />We see similarities in George and Harold's overlapping stories. Harold was epileptic, now George is hallucinating as he dies. Harold was an actual tinker, George took an early retirement and spent the last two decades of his life tinkering with old clocks. Both men, while loving their children, are disconnected.<br /><br />Tinkers is a photo album of several souls passing through this world. Neither George nor Harold are the heroes of the story, but neither are they villains. They just are: two recognizable humans. And we cans sympathize with their plight, passing us by and pointing their fingers at our normal lives. Life is short, the world strange, mysterious and cold, and meaning is all too hard to come by.<br /><br />Tinkers was enjoyable to read and thoughtful. Paul Harding definitely speaks with subtlety, but, in my opinion, at the danger of saying too little. No, novels don't have to preach morals. And Yes, the human element in this story was moving. I just wished this good book could have been better.
0765326353|2.0|Pretty much my title sums it up. While I'm a huge fan of Sanderson's work usually, I consider the Mistborn series among the best fantasy fiction I've ever read, this novel fell far short of my expectations. The first issue is the novel's length. While I usually have no problem reading novels at the 1000 page length, by the halfway point I felt this was a chore in this case. A large contributing factor to the length is the poor structure of this novel. While jumping between several characters, Sanderson fails to give the connection the characters that is so important in this type of fiction ultimately this is compounded by the unfortunate structure he's chosen to tell the story in. While some characters do interact, or are related to each other but never meet it does not serve the story in any way, instead it seems like he wrote several novels and then interspersed their chapters together. Overall a clumsy attempt but I can say I have hopes for this series overall.
0385341008|4.0|I found myself wishing I could meet certain characters of this book. The letter-style writing took a little bit of getting used to (it required a little bit of concentration to keep the characters straight at first), but the result was wonderful. I suggested this novel for our book club and we all enjoyed it and the discussion that ensued. :)
1400031524|2.0|The group rating this at  \\"3\\" or below summed it up well.   As one who's  purchased and enjoyed numbers of Mankells' books,  I found this to be a poor reflection of his fine capabilities otherwise.  Some reviewers indicated it was their first experience with Mankell and would likely be their last - I would have felt the same way.      The first part of the book suggested numbers of opportunities for a great plot but as it moved from Sweden to Latvia (a country described as having communist influences), the plot became absurd.   I believe readers of mysteries generally like books with plots that could be feasible.  From aspects involving Wallender's immediate personal interest in the widow of a murdered Latvian police officer to his reason for being in Latvia in the first place, let alone his return to Latvia as a respected Sewdish police officer sneaking into a foreign  country,  the  events in this book didn't even hint at being remotely possible.  This book is titled  \\"Dogs of Riga\\"  in summary , as they say in some parts of the US \\"this dog don't hunt\\".
9889979942|5.0|I just finished reading \\"China: Portrait of A People\\", by Tom Carter, and was compelled to write about it. The pictures and colors are magnificent.  I particularly love the pictures of the children.  My niece was adopted from China as a baby and has no recollection of the beautiful country where she was born.   When she is a little older, I plan on giving her this book so she can see her heritage, and appreciate this beautiful country and the people.     Thank you Tom for a wonderful read, and I look forward to seeing more of your work in the future.
B001U887Q0|5.0|Gift for my wife, who loves them because they are warm and very comfortable.  I brought the next size up from her normal shoe size because of previous online reviews noted that the Blitzen Crocs are sized smaller than the other Crocs.
B002ZG977Y|2.0|The Perseus in the original movie was more of a hero than in the new movie.  In the new movie, Perseus was simply bent on revenge -- I could just never care for the guy.  A hero cares about the living -- but he was bent on revenge for the dead.  That really sums it up for me -- I really don't need to say more.    I will add that the 3D version really let me down.  It was converted to 3D in post-production (originally shot in 2D).  The 'technology' they use just doesn't do it for me!  I love 3D movies, but I don't care for this post-production junk they keep dishing out.  I think even the new 'Narnia' movie was converted to 3D in post-production, although the results were somewhat better.  If the results just don't look right, people will notice -- and it will bother them just like it bothers me!    In the new 'Clash of the Titans' movie, the special effects were excellent, but that's about the best thing I can say for it.
B004132HZS|4.0|I was dead-set against this when I first heard about it.  I love Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, and have read through The Canon many times.  I love Jeremy Brett's [[ASIN:B000RPCJB6 Sherlock Holmes]] and hated [[ASIN:B001OQCV6A Robert Downey Jr's]].  Holmes should not be hip.  Holmes should not be updated, and Holmes should never say \\"Elementary, my Dear Watson.\\"<br /><br />After much opposition, \\"Sherlock\\" was finally shoved into my hands as a Christmas Present and I was told to \\"just watch it.\\"  And I did.  And it was very, very good.<br /><br />Right off the bat, I was sold by Martin Freeman's Dr. John Watson.  Having him come home wounded from the current Afghanistan war was brilliant, and his entire manner was just right.  This was a strong, competent Dr. Watson, the kind of guy who backed up Holmes with a revolver in his pocket.  I was less overwhelmed by Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock.  He didn't look right, with that mopish hair, and his introduction of having him whip a corpse to test for bruising patterns was too sensationalist.  But he grew on me, and I eventually accepted him in the role.<br /><br />Even with the series being updated, there are lots of scavenger hunt nods in the series for those who known their Canon.  Watson's psychosomatic limp coming from a wound to the shoulder was an excellent reference to the traveling injury in Doyle's stories.  And all the homosexual misunderstandings between Holmes and Watson made me laugh, that being a common thread for Holmes interpreters and played upon in [[ASIN:B00005JKHF The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]].  In the second episode, \\"The Blind Banker,\\" there is a nice modernization of the five orange pips from \\"The Sign of Four,\\" and \\"A Study in Pink\\" is a nice updating of \\"A Study in Scarlet.\\"<br /><br />If there was a disappointment, it was in Moriatry.  The grand reveal of the character was well done, but Andrew Scott played him as a cackling psycho rather than a cold and calculating reflection of Holmes.  He has more in common with The Joker than with traditional plays on Holmes's arch-enemy.  I also would have liked to have seen Watson's medical expertise being brought into play.  More than once Watson defers to Holmes on medical issues, which just didn't ring true.<br /><br />Also, be warned; the box set says \\"Season One,\\" and this is true.  This is the complete first season.  But, the first season consists only of three episodes, and hardly even justifies being on two disks.  On top of that, it ends on a cliff-hanger.  So this is more of a teaser than a satisfying viewing experience.  There is enough here to make you want more, but then you have to sit and wait while that \\"more\\" is filmed.ker than with traditional plays on Holmes's arch-enemy.

B0010T3UUM|5.0|After weeks of research, and another pair of clogs that didn't fit, we purchased these for my husband to wear at work. He is on his feet all day, working in the hospital O.R. He'd been wearing tennis shoes up until this point, but they were impossible to clean and just not very comfortable. For some reason, I didn't expect that these crocs would have enough support but my husband insisted that lot's of his coworkers loved them - so I ordered them. He loved them, even more so than other more expensive brands he'd tried on. They are so easy to clean and sterilize, and look sharp too. He's been wearing them for a few months now and still loves them. Wish we'd bought these for him years ago....
1439152780|4.0|I loved Kate Morton's first 2 books and eagerly anticipated this book.  The first 200 pages were a bit agonizing- very slow and overly detailed.  However, after that the book took off and Kate Morton's prowess as a writer began to show itself once again.  The mystery is compelling and deeply layered in the rich stories of the well-developed characters.  Totally worth your time if you can show some patience in the beginning...
044654759X|5.0|Very quick read! Reminded me of \\"The Guardian\\" with the thriller aspect of the book! A must read for any Nicholas Sparks fan!
B000002L5P|5.0|The lyrics and guitar work are unmatched by their later records. Yes, Meat is Murder and Queen is Dead are amazing accomplishments, but this record is a complete original. From the provocative narration and structure of the songs to the stripped down production that gave birth to the Marr chiming guitar--the album is a wash of vulnerability, humanity, and luscious hypnotic soundscapes.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I picked up this book for two reasons, I've seen the hype and I was recommended to read it by someone i stood in line next to at the movie theater.  I had no idea what the book was going to be about (did not read the synopsis) but was not disappointed.  The first few pages are a little slow, the author is trying to create an allusion of mystery that I was not intrigued by.  However, the book quickly picked up and I was glued to the pages (well... screen, since I'm a kindle owner).  There are reviewers that complain about it being a \\"rape fest\\", but that gives a wrong impression of a book in a review<br /><br />The story is a murder mystery involving the disappearence of a girl 40 years ago.  The \\"girl with the dragon tattoo\\" is an smart young girl that helps a journalist attempt to crack the mystery.  A great read (I usually don't read this genera, but it peaked my interest)
0316098337|5.0|\\"Room\\" by Emma Donoghue is written through the eyes and told in the voice of boy just turing five years-old. It seemed like it would have been tiresome reading a whole book as if I were reading a book to a small child. Well, after a few pages it was apparent that this was no children's book.<br /><br />Jack had lived his whole life in the confines of one room which he referred to as \\"Room\\". The whole world was eleven feet square. His mother, whose name is never mentioned, had been kidnapped from college and kept captive by a specter-like captor named \\"Old Nick\\" in a shed in Old Nick's backyard.<br /><br />Jack is absolutley adorable. He's innocent and inquisitive. His mother loves him dearly. She teaches and nurtures him despite her limited resources. His character is well shaped and compelling. The story, as told by Jack, brings life into a new light. The freedom the rest of the world enjoys becomes invaluable and precious.<br /><br />Make no mistake, Room is unnerving and deeply disturbing. Certian events take some time to digest and I admit that I felt a tear or two drop during the story. The story is deeply haunting and follows me around even days after finishing. I read Room quickly because the tone captured me and wouldn't release me. After I finished, the outside air smelled just a little sweeter.
0786915749|5.0|I read this series (meaning the first three books) for the first time is sixth grade, mostly I just wanted to falunt how my book was the biggest, thus I was the smartest. I never finished it.    I picked the series up again in senior year and was immediately hooked. I am re-reading them now, 10 years later. The characters, although cliche, are fun to follow and the kender provides comic relief. The mage always intrigued me, as did his effort in casting spells; he can cast spells, but is crippled, so he can't cast a gigantic fireball and then skip away completely unaffected. The half-elf and brutish fighter grated on my nerves because I was just hoping for some flaws and they never showed up. Overall, the characters aren't a great piece of work, but then again VERY few are.    The plot is followable and utterly nonbelievable, which thrills me. I live in a world of laws and ethics, I don't want to read about one too.     If you like the stuffy fiction that is rated as \\"masterpieces\\" because of their overly long descriptions that make you want to scream \\"I GET IT. THE RING IS EVIL!\\", then you won't like these books. What other raters call simplistic, I call minimal. Honestly, I don't care much for literary devices or a believable world of overly-developed characters and plants. I want the author to get to the point, and that is what Weiss and Hickman do.    The understandable writing and easy to follow story make for good reading however light. This is a good book if you don't like to read the smae paragraph twice to figure out what the damn author is trying to say or if you don't care what shade of magenta someone's hair is and what they think about every step they take (character development?). Overall, it earns the five stars, no matter how unlike Tolkein it is.

0143117130|4.0|It isn't often that I come across books that make me laugh more than a few times throughout the story, but Bridget Jones's Diary is an exception. Helen Fielding is a comedic genius- really and truly. She puts the horrors of dating in a hilarious light, and one can't help but scream with laughter at the things Bridget says. She is a thirtysomething single woman living in England, and it's the single part that's really a stickler. She smokes, is trying to cut back on booze and on her weight, and has to deal with the highly annoying people around her. She meets two men in the book, but one is a sanctimonious jerk and the other only appears to be that way. Life isn't always easy for the SIngletons, as Bridget fondly calls them, but it definitely is humorous. The question \\"How's your love life?\\" has never really been all that funny before, but the magic of Fielding is that she makes it so. You will read this book and cry with laughter, and many will also be able to relate to Bridget, whether it be about overly-doting parents or dismal love lives.

B0049ZAFC0|5.0|I've winced through many a bad episode and weak season to get to this. This episode has the perfect balance of touching moments, revealing plot advancements and done-in-one danger. Every episode in season 10 has so far left me either smiling, clapping or begging for more. This episode's funny and charming exploration of Lois & Clark's newly honest relationship was every bit enjoyable, as was the inevitable transformation of little Alexander into the man he was cloned to become. Great stuff all around.

0140143505|3.0|My mum gave me this for Christmas and said I had to read it, it was fantastic. So I read it, and I really enjoyed it. I loved the correspondence, as one of the other reviewers said, it made me want to get a penfriend, but outside of that it is far from my favourite and I couldn't quite work out what mum was talking about. When I asked her, she agreed with everything I said, and said that she too had just been wrapped up in the first half of this book. It's really well-written, and I think any reader should read it once, it is a classic ... but as I said, it's not going to make my favourites list in a hurry!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Why does George Lucas hate his fans so much? The same fans that made him a billionaire and help fund his Skywalker Ranch, ILM and other business ventures of his!    Is it too much to ask that he remaster the original, unaltered theatrical releases of the original trilogy?    A lot of the charm of the theatrical releases was the traditional model work, props and costumes of the era but Lucas would rather bastardize his work than to let it stand for all time!    And what about the actors that have been erased such as the voice of Boba Fett or Sebastian Shaw who got replaced at the end of Jedi by that no talent Hayden Christensen!    His contemporaries such as Francis Ford Coppola, Ridley Scott and Steven Spielberg have all put out special editions of Apocalypse Now, Blade Runner and Close Encounters of the Third Kind respectively. The difference is, they each included the original theatrical release either through seamless branching or included on a separate disc.    Why does Lucas refuse to do this, I am sure he would sell twice as many if he did!    Until he finally releases the original cuts, and I am not talking as a low quality bonus disc from an old laser disc, I want fully restored with 5.1 loss-less HD audio, I will not buy!!!
0199538115|5.0|This book was excellent.  I would highly recommend it to others.  I expected the ending to end one way and was completely surprised when it ended another way.  Even though the time period is way back when, it kept me interested.
B000065AU2|4.0|`Russian Roulette' could be seen as the beginning of the end for German metal monsters Accept but it is still a fine record. Not on par with `Restless & Wild' or `Balls to the Wall' but just as good as its predecessor `Metal Heart',  the band's seventh LP was the end of an era as founding member and vocalist Udo Dirkschneider left the band soon after to begin his solo career. Dissatisfied with the growing commercial elements in the band's sound, Udo was making a statement and unfortunately for me personally, Accept ceased to be a serious player in the truly global world of heavy metal.  `Russian Roulette' is still pretty heavy and shows that the band ended their golden age fighting all the way - \\"Aiming High\\" as it were.  Is there redundancy or a sense of - been there done that with this record? Yes but I would say that `Russian Roulette' rewards the listener with repeated spins and the first three songs are great - \\"TV War\\", \\"Monster Man\\" and the title track all keep the tradition alive of pulverizing political metal. And yes \\"Heaven Is Hell\\" is very similar to \\"Balls to the Wall\\" but it is still an enjoyable ditty. Maybe the one complaint that I would say is legit is that much of the second half of this LP is filler or at the very least very formulaic and that does drag it down (though \\"Man Enough to Cry\\" sticks in my brain like a hypnotic suggestion. Regardless of the album's shortcomings, `Russian Roulette' is a hell of a lot better than most commercial metal of 1986 and for that the goofy troll and fatigues should be celebrated.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Welcome to the world of Panem formly America the country is devided into 13 districts (the 13th district before the books timeline). Katniss Everdeen lives in the 12th district (which is known for its coal mines) must face against the odds for her family and district in this si fi tale including mutants romance and freindship. When I first heard about this book I thought I would't like it because at that time I was on a strict Percy Jackson reader diet once I finished Lost Hero the trilogy was already finished so I thought to myself what the hek I will read this book and see how bad it is. Boy was I wrong once I finished with the first chapter I was engulfed in the book I read from 12A.M. to 6A.M. causing my kindle's book light to burn out I know the book is that addicting! With only a few small plot holes which will probably be covered in the sequel (which I'm really exicited to read) I give this book 4 stars

030746363X|1.0|The 4-Hour Body presents the author's many techniques for operating his body (and those of others, in at least one case) as though it's a machine. The goals of this book are apparently:  * make a lot of dough for Timothy Ferriss  * convince readers that Timothy Ferriss is one awesome dude  * show readers how to become as awesome and dudely as Timothy Ferriss    In this book you'll find how to eat ridiculously, sleep in bizarre patterns, work out extremely, and so on -- resulting in an awesomer, dudelier you! Even the chapter on how to induce orgasm in women reads like an operating manual -- very strange and disheartening way to approach sexual intimacy. Much of the book reads like a parody of Men's Health magazine, which exhibits some of the same depressing qualities (self-absorption, regard of oneself as a machine that can be manipulated for maximum results, excessive focus on appearance), although at least that magazine's articles seem to have been reviewed and edited.    This book will appeal to obsessive-compulsive narcissists everywhere, as well as to lazy peddlers of self-help pablum who want to see how a master manages to pull the wool over the eyes of legions of followers.
B000063V8S|2.0|I just got this season and was looking forward to watching the episode \\"brothers\\" for the first time only to discover the first disc is bad and doesnt play. I am begining to wonder if all the products from here are sub-standard quality or what?    The Series itself is ok, entertaining but if your a Star Trek fan and like continuity you might want to be careful where you buy it since you can't return it opened and a bad disc is useless. This is the second time I have received a bad disc in a season of a series I ordered here.    I ordered Season three of Voyager as well at the same time and it also had a bad disc. I am very disappointed. One bad disc one time is bad enough but two in the same order just enough to screw up both series is crazy. Is there any recourse at all?    Very disappointed.
0307592839|2.0|I just don't understand all the positive reviews for this book.  It is a series of short stories that are somewhat linked and it jumps around between time frames and characters while leaving a lot of questions unanswered.  As a baby boomer, I did not find any of the characters to be anyone I could relate to from my life experiences, and there were no heroes,  It wasn't a horrible book, it just left me cold, not sure what she was trying to accomplish with this book.  Yes, we all get older and some of us learn from the mistakes we made earlier in life and some of us don't - not exactly a unique concept.  I came close to not finishing it several times.  The power point piece actually is unique, it just took up more pages in the book for the message it had to deliver.  In fairness, this writer seems to have a good style-probably a very good writer- I just did not like the concept, the story is disjointed-hard to follow and piece together.  Can't recommend- seems to be a Jonathan Franzen wantabe with a disjointed concept,
0802130208|5.0|I adored this book!  All the characters blend so perfectly together and caused me to go through such an array of emotions.  Sadness for Ignatius' mother, shame at Mr. Gonzalez's lack of backbone, fits of laughter at Miss Trixie's one-liners (every time she calls Ignatius Gloria I couldn't help but crack up!), intense hope that it would all work out in the end, and many more along the way.  I was constantly bracing myself for what hilarious (and probably unsettling) antics Ignatius would be up to next.  Ignatius' hilarious diatribes are so incredibly clever, I can't believe they are not the work of a team of comedians, but one brilliant mind.    Overall, it is an amazing novel.  Prepare yourself, it is probably unlike any other book you've read before.  I can understand why it is not everyone's cup of tea, but it is certainly worth a sit down.  If you don't like it, I'm sure you can give it away to someone who will love it.  As I think many people reviewing this novel mentioned, but I feel I must state as well, it is a great tragedy that readers were not blessed with many more novels by this incredibly talented writer.

0143118420|3.0|I at first was going to write a long rant about how self-centered the author is, how she wasted her time (she went to Italy and did NOTHING with art), how uninspiring it was (in the sense that she was only able to do this because she had money, which a lot of people don't have), and so on and so forth, but I can see that it's already been done.    So, to save us both the time, think of it like this; this book was so mediocre, that even though my sentiments have already been expressed, I decided to write this view simply to reinforce it on the amazon ratings.
0756659841|5.0|This item is great not only because of the sheer number of stickers (1000! what a great price!) but because each page spread is devoted to one Lego collection and gives the background for the characters in the collection:  City, Star Wars, Harry Potter, Indiana Jones, Batman, Atlantis, Castle, Pirates, Space Police, plus a few others I haven't seen in stores here (Train, Agent).  It tells you a bit about the personality of each character and the storyline behind the collection, so that my son's imagination can take off as he makes up new scenarios using either the stickers or the minifigures he has.  There are PAGES AND PAGES of \\"Extra stickers\\" at the end that kids can use anywhere they want, and this is keeping my son preoccupied long after he has put all the main stickers on their respective pages.  And there are funny additional minifigure stickers that are \\"one-offs\\" not devoted to any of the collections represented, such as minifig stickers of Shaquille O'Neal and various other recognizable personalities.  This was my son's favorite Christmas present, and he is 4, just transitioning from Duplo to Legos.  On Christmas day, he even asked to put the rest of his presents back under the tree so he could play with it.  We'll be buying some of the other DK Lego sticker collections for our next trip to keep him preoccupied in the plane or car.

6305327084|5.0|Set amidst a realistic ten-year reunion, Beautiful Girls inhales a slice of apple pie on its way towards sublime Americana.  Complete underrated in every way, the movie focuses on a group of friends from the upper-northeast who have all approached crossroads or midlife crisis moments in which they must all embrace a decision and stick with it.<br /><br />Perhaps the best I've ever seen, the ensemble cast nails each and every role seamlessly, creating realistically poignant situations in which every viewer can find similarity.  Played by Timothy Hutton, the lead character is a bar pianist named Willie who returns home to a strained relationship with his successful girlfriend, an awkward familiarity with his father and younger brother (David Arquette), and a next door neighbor who soon complicates Willie's life.  Natalie Portman's performance as a 13-year old with an \\"old soul\\" is utterly convincing; it is perhaps the best performance of her career to date.  While the nearly 15 year age gap may put off some viewers, the skill of both actors makes the situation believable and, more importantly, understandable.  Male viewers can easily empathize with the hint of doubt in Willie's mind telling him to simply wait 5 years for the perfect girl.<br /><br />Among Willie's friends is Paul (Michael Rappaport) and Tommy \\"Birdy\\" Rowland (Matt Dillon), neither of which are typically favorites of mine.  But, once again, the casting is perfection.  Paul's infatuation with models - named his dog Elle McPherson - and refusal to grasp his colossal mediocrity is the very definition of Rappaport.  Birdy, on the other hand, is the big man on campus, star quarterback who parties hard and gets to choose between girls like Mira Sorvino (Sharon) and Lauren Holly (Darian).  Ten years later, however, they are not so keen to compete, particularly when Darian is married with children and Birdy has parlayed his high school stardom into a dead-end snowplow operation gig.  If that isn't the definition of Matt Dillons across America, then I don't know what is.<br /><br />The power of this movie is in the casting and the realism.  Among other familiar Hollywood faces is Rosie O'Donnell, who predictably plays a bitter fat chick who can't take the fact that men dream of supermodels, and Uma Thurman, who plays an integral role as the film's pseudo-muse, a visitor whose beauty is overhyped but whose wisdom is enough to provide directions, if not answers.  Linked to the characters' believability is the sharp, witty dialogue written by Scott Rosenberg.  In each conversation there is a hint of each viewer's past, present, and future; they are discussions we have all had.  A very powerful screenplay makes this movie really sink in.<br /><br />Ultimately, this film balances the precarious chick flick tightrope, managing to create acceptable date movie content while engaging male viewers.  Easily one of my favorites, Beautiful Girls is film about friends and relationships, a film in which we can all see ourselves.<br /><br />Jason Elinlons across America, then I don't know what is.

I never really minded the addition of things to the OT, but the modifications were, IMO, generally for the worse.  See the title for this review.

B001SS3JS8|5.0|This was an intelligent read, just as all Jodi Piccoult novels are, as well as a quick one. The story-line is suspenseful and well thought-out. She is one of those rare authors that talk about what no one else will and she also visits the places she writes about. Just wonderful! I would recommend it to any of my friends. If you want a light, easy read, this is not it. It's passionate and tragic but one of those that's worth it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I got a new Kindle for Christmas and I was looking for a new book to read. My friend who is in school studying to be a school teacher told me that this book is being used a lot in schools to try to get kids interested in reading. She told me I HAD to read it. Well I was skeptical because it did not sound like a book I would ever read, especially since they read it in schools (which I found most of those books boring). I read this book in about a day and could not wait to start the next one. It really draws you in and it is such a great, powerful story. The lead character is a girl which just makes this book so much better in my eyes since you rarely see such a strong female lead. I am in my early 20's and love this book. I have encouraged everyone I know no matter what their age is to read it. I just finished the entire series and I want to turn around and read this book again.

In addition, the video demonstrates well what Gladwell describes as the path to 'genius'.  These guys breath music with every breath and have such passion and devotion to the art that their genius just easily followed.  Their time and dedication to the art form created the soundtrack to many lives and inspired countless others to build upon their legacy.  A great movie - I wished it was another hour or two longer.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />In the not-so-grand tradition of \\"When Worlds Collide,\\" \\"Earthquake,\\" \\"The Day After Tomorrow,\\" \\"Armageddon,\\" \\"Deep Impact,\\" \\"The Core,\\" etc., \\"2012\\" is a big-budget disaster picture with a low-budget mentality.  Just how foolish it will look in 2013 is anyone`s guess - though it couldn't possibly look any more foolish than it did when it was released in 2009.  And all courtesy of that Grand Poobah of disaster flicks, Roland Emmerich.<br /><br />The doomsday scenario in this instance comes in the form of exploding solar radiation that has become so intense that it's begun to cause the Earth's core to melt (like a microwave oven, we`re told), resulting in the wholesale destruction of the planet's crust.  This obviously doesn't bode well for the people dwelling on the surface, where life as we know it will soon cease to exist - just as the Mayans so cannily predicted centuries ago.<br /><br />As with any disaster-movie worthy of the title, the story involves little more than an assortment of stock characters trying to keep one step ahead of the impending apocalypse.  This particular cross-section of humanity includes John Cusack as a writer of prescient but less-than-commercially-successful sci-fi novels, Amanda Peet as his ex-wife, Danny Glover as the President of the United States, Thandie Newton as the President's daughter, Oliver Platt as his self-interested Chief of Staff, Chiwetel Ejiofor as a brilliant geologist, and, for comic relief purposes, Woody Harrelson as a bug-eyed, trailer-dwelling, crackpot conspiracy theorist whose theoretic conspiracies turn out to be anything but crackpot.<br /><br />And because of the enormous and far-reaching nature of the disaster, the movie can borrow bits from any number of previous disaster movies and get away with it; thus, we get a touch of \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" here, a smidgen of \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" there.  Heck, there's even a hint of \\"Wall-E\\" in the closing moments.<br /><br />There's always an odd and uncomfortable moral principle operating in films of this type: namely, who cares if the whole world is going to hell in a hand basket, so long as our intrepid band of survivors (usually including an adorable pet or two) makes its way to safety.  And the trite and corny estranged-spouse melodrama involving Cusack and Peet that Emmerich and co-writer Harald Klasser have seen fit to plaster onto their vision of a worldwide holocaust is enough to make us start rooting for humanity's wholesale annihilation long before the movie's hit the halfway mark.  Apparently, in contradiction to what Rick said at the end of \\"Casablanca,\\" the problems of a couple of little people DO amount to a hill of beans, after all - at least in the eyes of Hollywood.<br /><br />Of course, one doesn't go to these types of films in search of grand themes or complex characterizations, but rather for the epic and wanton destruction of all things animate and inanimate - and in that respect, at least, \\"2012\\" delivers the goods.  In fact, the action and special effects are so preposterous and over-the-top that one can't help but admire the sheer, unadulterated, childlike trashiness of it all.<br /><br />So hunker on down to watch humanity get the [...]-kicking of a lifetime - just make sure to have plenty of popcorn and Jujubes on hand to help get you through the experience.erating in films of this type: namely, who cares if the whole world is going to hell in a hand basket, so long as our intrepid band of survivors (usually including an adorable pet or two) makes its way to safety.

B000ICLRIE|5.0|The version of this movie that came out in theatres was so-so. I got the director's cut on DVD and it is much, much better. The special features are quite good as well.    HOWEVER, please be aware that the 4-disc version with all the special features is DVD only. The Blu-Ray ONLY contains the movie. Amazon simply copies the details from the DVD listing and paste them here. And when I say movie only, I mean the Blu-Ray is literally just the movie.    I like Amazon but this is one area they get lazy on. They don't bother to accurately list what comes with a particular version of a film.    But again, if you haven't seen the director's cut of this, find a way to see it as it is vastly better than the theatrical version.
044654759X|2.0|I reside in Southport, NC, so I was looking forward to reading Safe Haven, however, I was disappointed in the author's \\"location scenes\\".  I realize that this is a work of fiction and it was set in the small town of Southport.  The author could have selected a few high spots in SE North Carolina.  Generally, children don't want to go to Orton, which was sold and closed in June.  They want to go to the NC Aquarium at Ft. Fisher via the Southport/Ft Fisher ferry or the NC Maritime Museum in Southport.  Much more fun for young children.  The beach is only about 20 minutes away on Oak Island, not a journey.  I think these scenes could have been used in the story.  Most of my friends who read the book didn't like the way Southport was, or rather was not shown. Yes, I realize there is literary freedom, but don't promise a location and then don't mention a few of the favorite spots.  I pre-purchased this book from Amazon,I received it quickly and read it right away.

0307272702|1.0|I should have known better, having read his glorification of the Atkins Diet in his New York Times column -- some argue the most stupid column to ever grace the pages of the NYT.  I can only surmise that Gary Taubes gets his bookwriting underwritten by the same industries that underwrite Michael Pollen's drivel -- the industries that are responsible for why we are all fat.  Taubes is a good writer -- but \\"that which is not worth saying is not worth saying well.\\"  In this case it's worse than than -- because what Taubes writes is not innocuous.  If you heed his message -- and that of his accomplice in crime Pollen -- you will remain fat (or get fat if you have't gotten there yet).  Want to know how to be trim and healthy?  All you need is a 6-word diet book:  Don't put junk in your mouth.  Sadly, Gary does not give the truth to you -- the book does not deliver on its promise to explain why we are all getting fat.  I wish I could say otherwise.  Gary is such an effective writer -- what a waste of wonderful talent.  And what I compromise of personal integrity.  Very disappointing.
B001BKG9RQ|5.0|I bought the Live at Gdansk set which included 2 DVD's and 2 CD's as soon as it was released. I always buy and love everything Pink Floyd and David Gilmour. This was no exception. At first I was mainly impressed with the inclusion of Fat Old Sun on which David did a magnificent job. Great guitar solo! After listening to the CD's while driving, I began to appreciate the music more and more and notice the different touches on these new recordings more and more. I love this version of Shine on You Crazy Diamond. I have listened to Disc 2 of this set countless times while driving during the past couple of years. Somehow that disc just seems to find its way back into my car cd player again and again. I can't get enough of it. I came to appreciate the recording of Echoes most of all. It is glorious and that  alone is worth the price of the package. I also enjoyed the DVD's especially since it was Richard's last concert filmed with David, and I treasure it, also, but it is the cd's that I have enjoyed so much!
030745455X|4.0|I am really struggling with this series.  In concept these are excellent story lines (this book series), but I am frustrated with the execution of the storyline delivery.  Again this book was about 100-150 pages too long.  I think what makes them frustrating for me is that there are just too many unnecessary characters to keep track of.  I'm often forgetting who is who and what they mean to the story.  There are times when the story just races along for a few pages and then WHAM! we are slapped back to page after page of unnecessary detail.<br /><br />Am I surprised that I do not adore the books when the rest of the world seems to rate them five out of five stars?  Not really.  I generally do not find myself siding with the mainstream.  I will read the final book in the trilogy because I'm invested in the two main characters and want to see how the author ends the saga.  However, I am going to read a few other books before I invest another 500+ pages of time into the last book.
B00136PZ8W|5.0|wow...these 10 yrs sure went by fast! Jennifer was at her peak back then. When she released this cd, it went to #1<br />along with her new movie \\"The Wedding Planner\\". She became the first artist to have the a #1 album and a #1 movie<br />during the same week. During the mid-2000s, her popularity started to wane down. I wonder why...her music has<br />always been fun and catchy. I don't get how Britney who isn't that vocally stronger than Jennifer still manages to<br />generate interest from people, but Jennifer can't. It's beyond me. Maybe her being a judge on Idol will do her some good. What makes J.LO different from On The 6 is that there is more variety...pop, dance, latin, salsa, hip hop, and r&b. This album has a nice little flavor to itself. It's definately one of the best from Jennifer. I recommend this for people are starting to like J.Lo's music or who ever listens to pop music in general.<br /><br />1. Love Don't Cost A Thing (5/5)-it's hip/rnb/dance song about jennifer explaining to her lover that money can't<br />buy happiness, our love, and what they shared. The video has always been my favorite. This song have to be one of<br />J.Lo's signature songs. It was all over the radio and music stations back then.<br /><br />2. I'm Real (5/5)-this one is more pop with a little hip hop beat thrown in.  i love the \\"she's a bad bad b**tch\\"<br />part.<br /><br />3. Play (5/5)- this song was written by christina milian when she was just branching out on her own. for the<br />parents, watch out for the f word somewhere in the song. jennifer can be so bad. lol<br /><br />4. Walking On Sunshine (5/5)- it's great song to workout to, at a club, or new year's eve party. it has the same<br />dance elements as \\"Waiting For Tonight\\".<br /><br />5. Ain't It Funny (5/5)-this one has a more latin vibe like Madonna's La Isla Bonita and Rihanna's Te Amo. i really like the remix though.<br /><br />6. Carino (5/5)-this is my favorite latin track on the album. I love the Puerto Rican salsa music on this one. It's the best!<br /><br />7. Come Over (5/5)- I AM IN LOOOOOOVE WITH THIS SONG AND ITS LYRICS!!!! I swear!!!! I played this song over the<br />phone to this Puerto rican dude and he actually listened to it without hanging up the phone! But I'm trying to<br />forget that moment ever happen...he was such a jerk towards the end.<br /><br />8. We Gotta Talk (5/5)-it sounds like It's Not That Serious from the On The 6 album with the same r'n'b beat.<br /><br />9. That's Not Me (4.5/5)-from listening to this song, i take it that this song is about her lover expecting her to<br />be like his mother, but she's just can't take the place of his mother.<br /><br />10. Dance With Me (5/5)- this is a nice song to dance at a party or simply show off your dance moves. for some<br />reason, it reminds me of those movies like honey or step up.<br /><br />11. Secretly (5/5)-when will r'n'b songs ever sound like this again??? these days, they auto tuned everything and I can't tell you how i'm really annoyed by it.<br /><br />12. I'm Gonna Be Alright (5/5)-i can't really decide whether like this original or the remix. they both sound good.<br /><br />13. That's The Way (4/5)-not really my favorite.<br /><br />14. Dame (4/5)- good...but sounds kinda redundant.<br /><br />15. Si Ya Se Acabo (4.5/5)-I still like Carino better, but this song sounds good.<br /><br />16. I'm Real (Murder Remix) (5/5)-i love this remix especially the opening part!!! it's my favorite out of all the<br />remixes from J to Tha Lo.IN LOOOOOOVE WITH THIS SONG AND ITS LYRICS!!!! I swear!!!!

630460288X|4.0|Snipes plays a the best role in the whole movie. The psycho with pride. Sallone's character does make the movie complete. Overall Demolition man is a classic stylish scify action movie but the scenery is a little dated for a futuristic movie.
B004FTVUH4|1.0|I was a big La Femme Nikita fan so looked forward to the opening of this series.  I was greatly disappointed.  To be fair, I only watched the first couple of shows so maybe it improved.  They should have given it a different name so that expectations would not have been so high.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have read in a very long time.  The story and characters draw you in from the very beginning.  This is the kind of book that you will want to read when you have an extended period of time because once you start it is nearly impossible to stop.  While the series is targeted to young adults, I feel most adult readers will also enjoy this book.  I could not wait to read the second book in the series.
B002ZG999U|1.0|I'd add more if I thought it was worth it. But it's not. There is no plot. And the action? Not enough to cover up the lack of plot. The acting, dialogue and plot was totally unbelievable, and not in a good way.<br /><br />Oh sure, I thought that all of these action stars (two or three of which aren't big enough deals to tango with the rest) in an effort to recreate an old action movie would have been a GREAT movie. I was freakin' excited to see this. I thought it'd be a great summer movie, something for a great group of guys/friends to see together.<br /><br />This was not the case.<br /><br />Please. If you value good movies, don't see it. The confusion in Inception was more bearable than this insult of cinematography.
B000002LK1|3.0|To my suprise. I did not know wey too manny people actualy love this cd. Wich makes senss that a few people made fun of me for doing a piss poor review on it. I hardly ever lissen to it. I am much more into the industrial stuff like \\"Gravity Kills\\"!
B003VIW8DU|4.0|Before you even play the CD, you're treated to a beautiful book of a package, featuring none other than Kate Moss posing in a classic Ferry/Roxy style.      Ferry was probably one of the first, if not -the- first leading rock men to wear a suit on stage.  Throughout his career, he's always cultivated the image and feel of the Euroized ultra hip sex Adonis.    I haven't watched the \\"making of DVD\\" yet, but sonically, with \\"Olympia\\", Ferry has put together a nice collage or retrospective of his entire career, using little sound quotes from past records here, and lyrical references there.     At 66, Ferry's voice is as smooth as it's ever been, and he comes across just as suave as he ever did.  At that age, is it all a show, or is he still getting it done with the ladies?  Maybe he's always just played that character.  In the end, it doesn't really matter one way or the other, Ferry always was, and still is, a class act.
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|EASY A is quite simply a modern day adaption of the classic tale THE SCARLET LETTER. A story of a woman who is accused of adultery by her community and forced to wear a scarlet A from that point on. In EASY A, Olive (the fantasticly dry and sharp witted Emma Stone), is the victim of a bathroom conversation in which she tells her friend that nothing happened between her and a college stud, but her friend doesn't believe her and neither does the ease-dropping ears. So when the rumor starts to spread like a viral u-tube video, Olive, the virgin, becomes Olive the promiscuous girl that nobody knew before and now EVERYBODY wants to know.<br /><br />EASY A is about lies and the danger of assumption. It's about how easy it is for reality to become something entirely different and how hard it is to change people's views of what they know the truth to be.<br /><br />The beauty of EASY A is that for a movie about lies, assumptions and skewed truths, the movie is so true to itself, real and honest. Olive's parents Rosemary & Dill (Patricia Clarkson & Stanley Tucci) are absolutely brilliant in their laid back, hippie mentality of being honest and open with their children. Until Olive gets caught up in her domino effect of lies and her new personna with her friends at school, her parents knew everything about her. There were no secrets because they had an open dialogue with her.<br /><br />So when Olive chooses popularity over trying to correct the false rumor about her, she for the first time holds a secret from her friends and parents and we see how lies, secrets and assumptions can destroy even the best of us.<br /><br />EASY A is hilarious in its honesty and among its laughs, in a subtle, quiet way, delivers a poigniant message. Well done from top to bottom.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This trilogy of books is the best that I have read in a very long time.  This second book in the series had plot twist that I never imagined.  I would suggest that this series be read when you have a lot of time to devot to reading because once you start this series of books it is almost impossible to stop.

B002UXRGM0|5.0|Wow, this blu-ray lives up to the hype.  The extreme close up shots are just as vivid as the sprawling landscape scenes.  The action is caught in slow motion and also crystal clear.  It says the plant scenes are in 1080i, they are still very impressive and youll forget you are seeing less than 1080p.  I watched this series when it was on the Discovery Channel and ill agree that David Attenborough is far superior for this series than Oprah
1400052173|5.0|This is hands-down one of the best books I have ever read. Besides the beautiful human-interest story and the harsh history lesson about medical ethics in the U.S., it made me, an English major whose only bio class in college was \\"Nutrition,\\" want to learn more about all the various scientists and other topics in the book. This book made me angry, sad, happy, and everything in between, but most importantly, it sparked curiosity in me that I never knew I had.
0316077054|4.0|This book picked up 4 months after Beautiful Creatures ended.  4 months after the disaster that was Lena's birthday and the death of her uncle.  The story was filled with mystery as we worked to uncover the twists and turns of Lena and Ethan's troubled relationship.  This book was so much more for me.  More of Ethan's mom and less of the drama centered around school.  Ethan's dad was more or less on the road to recovery and Link was more part of the story.  We were able to see a little more into Ridley and the struggle of her darkness and somwhere inside was lightness as well.  The Ravenwood family tree was discovered and Ethan's role in this story was explained more fully.  There was a new character introduced, John Breed.  I'm sure we haven't seen the last of him.  Now that Link is connected to him, I hope we find out more about him.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I'm really tired of sequels and re-makes of classics in Hollywood. There are a few original movies still being made, but non are executed as well as Inception. This one is one of the best movies of 2010 - heck, of all time.<br /><br />It's a sure shot classic!
0739344269|1.0|First of all, the book seems to be a repetition of the \\"Breafer History of Time\\". If you have read that book, I am not really sure if you need to read this one.<br /><br />I am a fan of Stephen Hawking, but after reading the first chapter, I just thought hey is this guy a professor of History or Physics? I mean the history as we know it, you know western oriented, history according to westerners, everything is started in Ancient Greece and invented by the westeners and the rest of the world are just followers kind of history. I guess he should stick with what he knows best and leave the history to experts.
B00000DWG6|5.0|as everyone knows , great performance , great recording and set list.so why are some parts left out? in shakin' all over , the part w/spoonful is absent and following that the intro to my generation (which is great)is left off (ref. midas touch label - complete   leeds ). plus why do they mess up the running order of the songs? they've reissued this , what 3 times now ? , i was hoping they'ed put it all together proper . but what the h*ll it's great anyway and the hull show is fantastic too  (maybe a better recording).

0446364495|5.0|I first found this book on a camping trip I took with my dad and step mom.  Found it in the top bunk of the camper and took it down and read it while we were driving to leavenworth.  I think I was 12 when I picked it up, I thought it was an amazing read and really hooked me.  The storyline was great and tragic.  This was a read that I carried with me and when I saw the book sitting in a used book store a few months ago I knew I had to have it. I still remember the story well and it is now sitting on my bookshelf with all my favorite reads.  Yes, I saw the movie, but I think this book is amazing in it's own right and I can't wait to take it off my shelf and read it again through adult eyes
B000FAGGWQ|5.0|I've always been a Star Wars fan but one comes to appreciate the classic story even more after they've watched this disk! It's so interesting to know what was behind the movies and see how it all came together. I strongly reccommend this DVD to any Star Wars fan. I've seen it multiple times and enjoy it each time as if it's the first time I saw it.
B001ECQ75A|4.0|Great movie.  He had a low to no fear complex & reacted low profile naturally to conflict.  Almost like a baby or small child who doesn't know if he stick his hand in the fire it will hurt him. He absorbed insults to pursue his dream, for he had ample knowledge of kung fu history.  Lesson for the youngsters - don't let anyone, anything people say or anything stop you from pursuing your dream.
B000P0J09C|5.0|I've read reviews of Full Metal Jacket that complain about it consisting of disconnected vignettes and it makes me wonder what people think goes on in a combat zone.  If you don't like Full Metal Jacket, you may not be interested in the truth.  I can't imagine what else you would say in a movie about Vietnam after this.
0061990477|5.0|I watched this as a mini series with my mom when I was about 14 or 15.  Any time it was on t.v., we watched it.  The story captivated me.  I knew it was based on a book and I went in search for it at the library.  Was it a heavy read for a 15 year old, you bet!  I couldn't believe how thick the book was, but I devoured it.  I may have been a little young, but the story had me entranced.  In my mind, it is one of the greatest stories I have ever read.  I own a copy and it sits on my bookshelf.  It's a very worn copy, but one I will never get rid of.  This is a very deep and tragic love story that travels over years in the book.  The mini series was good, but the book was far better
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I was skeptical when I saw that Steve Carell played the lead role. But I didn't even really notice. I thought he did a tremendous job with this character. really surprised, guess I don't know enough of his work. The movie was probably the best I saw in 2010. Can you believe that? A cartoon! I guess that is more common nowadays. Women were crying in the theater, including the one next to me! You know, that good cry. Watch this with your girl and/or family at home! Good couple of hours spent. I'd give it 6 stars, and i don't say that lightly. I saw Megamind last year also, and was so disappointed after seeing this. Not that it was really bad, but it pandered. If you have to make a choice, go with this one! This is THE 3D family movie!
B0044430H8|5.0|An amazing unique sound, simply beautiful. I want MORE! Every track is genius. It honestly does have a very different sound that I believe personifies the \\"Facebook\\" generation. I love it! (Did I mention that I love it?)

0810983915|5.0|Woof, woof. The setting of Diary of a Wimpy Kid takes place at the house and outside at the water park. This is my favorite part of the book. Greg wants someone to take a picture of him with some girl. So mom was supposed to get a picture of Holly Hills and Greg but she took a picture of a naked and fat man instead of Holly Hills and Greg.  Another thing that I liked about it is when the father goes to the gas station.  The mom gets out of the car and nobody notices that. The father comes back to the car. He did not notice that mom was not there. So they went back home.  They turned to tell mom they were there but they dint see her so they were thinking were was she. So they though they figure that she would be at the gas station so they went to the gas station and they found her all wet. The father saw her all mad so he tried to get her in the car so he got her in the car and took her home and gave her some hot coco after that the father of GREG took her to bed so GREG and his brother went to bed.
B003XTUZIM|5.0|Kudos goes to those involved in the DGM world - Thank you Mr. Fripp for another astonishing reissue.  This is the best you can get out of sound for Islands.  This release brings out the best of an album I had never really gotten my arms around in the past.  Nuances I never heard before as the band slips into jazz like performances.  Progressive rock at its best!  Surround treatments are exceptional.
030746363X|2.0|I was hoping this book would be full of practical recommendations for how to get in shape with minimal effort. Instead, it's basically a catalog of really off-the-wall self-experimentation which usually revolves around purchasing expensive supplements or tracking every single thing you eat. In fact, the entire chapter on the \\"slow carb diet\\" is lifted practically verbatim from his website, and his chapter on polyphasic sleep is lifted practically verbatim from Dustin Curtis's website. Not much in this book worth $15, unfortunately.

I have nothing extra to add, nor am I trying to convince anyone they need to buy this; I simply have to profess my love for this amazing score. Love love love it. The epic orchestral arrangements, making full use of drums and synth sounds wherever they work best... some would call it fusion--I just call it \\"right\\". It's all music, and damn is it beautiful.     Downsides: As the best reviews have detailed, it's ridiculous how The Man is releasing the tracks. I've bought this, but now I'm probably going to resort to other means to acquire all of the tracks. Also, I wish the tracks were longer, but that's par for the course with movie scores.

0061433047|5.0|Terry Pratchett should need no introduction. He is a knighted author of Fantasy, most famous for his Discworld series, which has inspired everything from cartoons, BBC movies, figurines, t-shirts, postage stamps, street names in a Somerset city, their own convention, and even a line of beer. I Shall Wear Midnight concludes his Discworld based young adult series focused on the adventures of Tiffany Aching in a dark and thrilling novel.<br /><br />Tiffany Aching is now a fifteen-year-old witch on the Chalk, an area known for soft soil and sheep. She is treated with respect, as any witch ought to be, but also with suspicion. Things get worse for her when the Baron, who owns most of the land, dies under her care and his nurse accuses her of black magic. She is sent on a mission to find the Baron's son, whom she saved in The Wee Free Men from the Queen of the Fairies.  She was rumored to have feelings for the Baron's son, even going so far as to use the necklace which he gave her to ensnare the Hiver in A Hat Full of Sky, and his fianc&eacute;, Letitia, and her mother, who is a Dutchess and makes it clear to everyone in the vicinity that this is her rank.<br /><br />On the coach ride to Ankh-Morpork, the Discworld equivalent to London or New York, she meets The Cunning Man, a conjured spirit of a murdered Omnian witch hunter who is occasionally resurrected throughout the history of Discworld to hunt and pursue witches, fueled by the deep seeded fear and mistrust of the members of their communities.<br /><br />Tiffany is helped by a few of the witches in Ankh Morpork, including the famous Mrs. Proust, who runs Boffo's joke shop, and Eskarina Smith, who is the first ever woman bequeathed a wizard's staff, and thus lives on the borders between witch magic and wizard magic. All of them are aware of The Cunning Man's presence, but it pursues only Tiffany, who must ultimately battle him to the death in the final chapters.<br /><br />As with many young adult series, as the characters grow and mature, so to do their worlds and the problems they must face. Tiffany Aching deals, within the first few chapters of the book, with alcoholism, domestic violence, infanticide and suicide, which is a far cry from slamming a river goblin in the face with a frying pan. Readers who have grown with the series will not be shocked, and indeed may champion Tiffany on these new adventures, but readers uninitiated may want to start with The Wee Free Men and work their way up through Tiffany's life. Still, this book certainly could stand alone, and deals readers a more realistic version of young adult life than many novels currently available. Though the themes are occasionally dark and mature, this is still a very entertaining and thrilling read, heavily spiced with Pratchett's trademark humor.<br /><br />Reviewed by Shroud's Joshua Gageworlds and the problems they must face.

B002JCSWV6|2.0|I thought this movie was going to be similar to other \\"feel-good\\" sports movies. Sadly, Invictus is no Rudy, The Natural nor Remember the Titans.    I understand the importance of the events this movie covers. I understand how monumental it was for South Africa to rally behind their rugby team as it wins the World Cup. But I didn't feel any kind of emotional connection with either Morgan Freeman or Matt Damon.    Freeman plays Mandela as he becomes President and attempts to forge forgiveness in his country. Damon plays the team captain of a struggling rugby team.    The two meet up for tea and discuss how important it is that the team wins the World Cup. That's the thrust of the movie. There could have been some monumental scenes dealing with the struggles of racial tension and there are a few moments.    But the characters feel flat. I didn't care if this team did well. I didn't see Damon rally his teammates like he needed to. It felt plain flat.    Then you have the technical aspect of this film. Director Clint Eastwood felt the need to repeatedly show us the size of the World Cup crowd in a CG arena. One or two swooping shots would have been enough. After 5 or 6 times, it begins to feel like a gimmick. I'm not longer impressed with the computer shots.    This movie could have been more inspirational than it ended up being.
B00119VMGK|2.0|This may be well written and done as far as plays go. If you are expecting a traditional movie you may be disappointed.This is done on a college type set with some props etc. The picture posted is misleading. I should have read the reviews but made a quick decision. Oh well, if you like school plays you might like it as long as you know up front what it is.
1599218011|5.0|Crazy, Sexy. Diet is fantastic!! This is not a \\"diet\\" book, it's a book that will help you transform your entire life. I have been following Kris Carr for 3 years, since seeing her documentary and everything she does to me is gold. She is such an inspirational, beautiful woman and as I expected her new book is phenomenal. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to WOW their life! Even if you are already a \\"health nut\\" and take amazing care of yourself there is sure to be inspiration in these pages that will keep you moving on your down days. I bought Crazy, Sexy, Cancer for my friend who was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and she loved it. I plan to buy this book for all of the people I love in 2011! Give people a gift that will empower them to change their lives!
0316069884|5.0|Eating Animals is the first book I've read by Jonathan Safran Foer.  I thought the author did an excellent job blending technical research with great literary skills to create a truly thought-provoking read.  I'm 29 years old and for the first 25 years of my life I was \\"eating animals\\" with little consideration of what this meant.  Most recently, I've adopted a vegetarian lifestyle with the exception of consuming fish on occasion.  I chose fish because I thought this animal product was the most environmentally conscious, and perhaps humane, way to still eat some form of animal.  Foer's presentation of industrial scale fishing methods, and the collateral impacts they have on other species of fish and the ecosystems they inhabit, has made me re-think this choice.    This book proved enlightening on so many levels and I cannot recommend it highly enough.  There is perhaps no better primer on the industrial food process, and the choice each one of us has to support or invoke change in these practices, than this book.    Regards,  Tyler  Salt Lake City, UT
1400052173|4.0|This is a wonderful book even if I wished it had even more of the science of cells in it. My gripe is not with the book but with the fact that there needs to be full disclosure in the opening review. Jad Abumrad is the host of Radiolab, the program for which Skloot also works/worked. In the interest of full disclosure, this relationship needs to be stated clearly in his review.
B001H9MYPW|5.0|I do not get HBO overseas here on the military base, and I was told you could purchase SEASON two at the local VIDEO store. I bought it and began viewing it. At first I wondered why I needed to watch someone else's pain, and normally I prefer comedies. Well, I was told it was very humorous,and upon witnessing a very burdened college student, a little boy caught in a divorce, a harried executive fired for not controlling the quality of his products, and a frustrated lawyer who was once attracted ( still is) to the therapist Paul, I found myself intently watching every thing they say and do. Perhaps, because I just finished two months of therapy from a very gifted therapist I could relate to what is taking place in those T V Sessions...it takes time.  Now, I could NOT see why our friend,the Dutch lady told us it was humorous...so I asked her. She said, \\"It is because of the language they use with one another..e.g. How do you feel about that? She found that to be humourous, she insisted. Oh well, I was not laughing. When Paul absolutely could not stand April's refusal any longer to get Chemo for her cancer and \\"Broke the Therapist - Client Barrier\\" and took her to the hospital...I had to cry...of that fact-- that therapists are human, and have feelings, and the very nature of what they do requires, itimacy, patience understanding, kindness, and YET..the Barriers...I had such a struggle with this in my recent therapy. I have never been subjected to such inhuman rules, as these barriers are- yet my bro-in-law is working on a PHD in clinical psychology and spent considerable time in trying to make me understand WHY these barriers are in place. The acting is superb, to think how gifted actors are for their portrayals of these troubled souls, and Gabriel Berne literally transposes his very thoughts as Paul to us, the viewers..it is quite incredible piece of work. My therapy was interrupted because the therapist was reassigned to another base, and I am allowed no further contact, no picture, no emails, and I still find those rules a hazard in human relationships. But the beauty of the therapy and turning a life around outweighs any fall out from the hazard of the barriers.
031603438X|1.0|Read the review by Jesse Kornbluth and others and you are likely to have a much more enjoyable and succinct review of Keith Richard's life.  If you buy the book, it is likely you will get frustrated by the excessively rude language and endlessly rambling style, which rarely gets to actually delivering an insight.    It is also very sad that Keith Richard shows no regrets, self-reflection or even genuine insight.  A number of people in his circle died early or had their lives ruined and the impression is that he is the kind of guy who doesn't really care what happens to others and that it is always the others who are wrong.  A pitty really.
B00192IV9U|5.0|If you listen to this album without any preconceived notions or bias you will find its a very good album. I listen to everything from aerosmith to zz top and this album is at least a 4. The songs best of joy and i like the way alone make it a 4,mike was a genius and those two songs especially are overflowing with it. You hear so many nuances and improvasations that most artist can't do.For example the he he's or shamones at the right time harmonizing in the background,vocals,and instruments all blended seamlessly.If you listen to it without comparing it to his past work or any problems in his life,you will find he left his fans a great tribute.He was human like we all are and flawed also,it is not for us to judge respect him for his talent and music and leave the rest to god.
B000002G60|4.0|For a Greenwich Village folkie, Suzanne Vega was one restless woman. Following a love on Nine Inch Nails, she made the \\"Industrial Folk\\" (her term) of \\"99.9 F°\\" and followed it with this, a slightly more subdued but no less adventurous album. \\"Nine Objects of Desire\\" runs the gamut from more industrial (the opening \\"Birthday\\") to the jazzy \\"Caramel\\" and the dreamlike finale, \\"My Favorite Plum.\\"<br /><br />The highlights are, as is typically with Vega's best work, the lyrics. The erotic \\"Caramel\\" uses an old standard form of substituting a candy for desire, but she stakes her own territory with the arrangement. \\"Honeymoon Suite\\" describes an enigmatic dream encounter her husband had, and includes the beautiful descriptive couplet \\"When we sleep so close together/that our hair becomes entwined.\\" I have also always loved the teasingly fun way she mixes gambling metaphors on \\"No Cheap Thrill\\" with casual romantic encounters. When it comes to these kinds of lyrical puzzles, Vega has few equals.<br /><br />It's interesting to note that many of these songs seemed rooted in the relationship with her then husband, producer Mitchell Froom. I say this mainly because her next album, \\"Songs in Red and Grey,\\" was less 'produced' and a heck of a lot more straightforward lyrically, and took five years to appear after this one. Taken as a pair, however, \\"Nine Objects of Desire\\" and \\"99.9 F°\\" make interesting bookends in Vega's always intriguing career.
B002ZE85YW|4.0|I thought this film was a step up from T3's Terminatrix nonsense, but it still went downhill in the final 30 minutes as far as plot points go (thus getting four stars). The entire film relies on the predictions of the nature of time travel. Several very bad military errors were made, even some by Connor himself, that made me want to choke those who wrote the script. This just takes away from any enjoyment of or engrossment in the action and possible emotions of the film. Cameron's vision is ultimately lost where characters have not been developed to their full potential.     As a woman, I see a failed role model in Blair Williams, who, far from what it appears they were going for, is more of a slut than a girl looking for comfort. I'm sure the boobery helped to sell the movie, however.     The corroborating plot points with T2 are extremely overt and annoying. They were not well-thought out, but thrown in to give a sense of continuity.     The parts of Kyle Reese, Sam Worthington, and John Connor are played by excellent actors, and it is their performance that carries this movie along. If not for the bad writing, this film could have been absolutely amazing. For those excellent actors, I still retain that 4 star rating.    Even so, the recordings Linda Hamilton made were obviously rushed and I don't blame her. She was too good for this film.     That said, this film should have been the real T3. I consider it so in my collection. It deserves a place because the predicted War Against the Machines has come. It had to come, and it had to be told, to give any weight to the prophecies of the first two films. Or.. maybe the mystery was better.     As for allegations to the Director's cut not being worth it: it is nonsense to say that getting more film and features is worse than getting a theatrical version. Two minutes is two minutes, and I wanted to see it.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I am an avid Jimmy Stewart fan.  I use to have everything he was ever in - but we flooded during Katrina and I am slowly replacing my DVD's.   If he is in it - I LOVE IT!!!!!
B000Z9PYJS|5.0|The introduction heralds this story as one to \\"make you believe in God.\\" Quite the claim, and yet it may be impossible to live up to, it certainly comes close. The writing is clear, concise, and poignant. The story is amazing in that it unfolds to a slow plot, or rather, a plot devoid of so-called twists and turns. Instead, the minute details of being human become twists, the story of survival the turns. Altogether an amazing accomplishment. Highly recommended.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|I really like \\"The Town\\" starring Ben Affleck, yeah okay some people might say this is a poor man's \\"Heat\\" but I say that despite some similarities, \\"The Town\\" stands on its own merit!  This is a great movie, Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner are excellent!  This is a must see!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is the greatest news that I have ever heard over Blu-ray. Now September 2011 is my Christmas for 2011, when I hold the box set of Star Wars. Soon as I heard the news of it from YouTube VIA CES 2011..... I knew blu-ray.com will have it's link up and running for the pre order and I was right. And just click Pre-order. Now over here lots of people are speculating about the quality of it going to be and the early episodes  transfers will look bad. Now let us not forget this.... we are here talking about THX right. All leading products want their products certified by THX. Even Avatar Blu-ray/DVD was certified by THX.<br /><br />Now let us not forget that this is a Gorge Lucas production and he owns the THX studios world wide. If he messes up his own production  he will be putting his name and his company/studio/reputation of  THX on-the-line. Therefore I am very well sure all episodes of  Star Wars transfer to Blu-ray will be one of the best that we can find around.  For those who are wondering please remember that you read this article when/if you buy it and that I was right. This will be the best transfer on Blu-ray from a very old production. Because they/he wanted to do it right only they took this long. Not like the Gladiator release. At a interview years ago, he said it takes like good Nine Months to finish One Episode of the transfer to Blu-ray. Finally Star Wars and Avatar will be Two of those titles where you want to show off your Home Theater for some time. And most of all it will be a THX certified Blu-ray DVD. I won't have any doubts off the quality of this Box Set. It is a Five Star And a Two Thumbs up production from me. Thanks you all for reading my post.
B000ASATWQ|4.0|Junior Gong dropped an A+ Album here. My favorites were (11) Road to Zion. This collab with Nas was conscious rap to the fullest. (12) We're gonna make it\\" Very inspirational. (6) Beautiful. This song is full of energy and had to be a great party record Bobby Brown makes a comeback of sorts, crazy beat, crazy bass.(13)In to deep (7) Pimpas Paradise. Sounds like a true story that might apply to many ex-fine women gone bad because of drug use. Black thought does a masterful job on vocals. (3) Welcome to jam rock. Was another solid cut. and (14)Khaki suit. It's another enjoyable song. Always fun to hear Bounty Killer \\"Lord have mercy\\"
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Ok here is my gear..... HTC EVO 4G, Beats by Dr. Dre Tour Mobile, Fiio E5.  I also downloaded the music app Power Amp from the Android Market b/c it has a built in EQ with presets.  Stock Android music player sounds like crap.<br /><br />I purchased the Dre Beats about a week ago,  they sound great! but not getting enough power from the EVO.  Then my friend showed me his E7 Fiio amp.... tried it out, and it was night and day...it was what i was looking for out of my $200 headphones.  But the E7 is huge!!  Came on Amazon, found the E5 and saw one of the customer pics where they attached it to the back of their case using the clip.  So I thought $22 bucks... what the hell ill give it a shot.<br /><br />Man the E5 sounds just as good as the E7!!! and for a quarter of the price and size!!  I cant even turn this thing all the way up...blasts my ears!  Oh and if your buying this for your phone.... calls work too... didn't even think about that when i bought it..but the controls on the headphones do NOT... tried with my cheap pair too.... nothing happens when you click the buttons.<br /><br />So if your looking for something to boost the output of your device with extra bass.. then look no further.  But if your device already sounds like crap.... all this will do is make it louder crap.
0765350386|4.0|For the first book in the series, Mistborn did a great job of crafting the world the story is set in. The magic system is very original, and like another reviewer said it is somewhat akin to super heroes. Others have criticized this book for its lack of character development outside of the two main characters. This is a valid statement in my opinion as well. Vin was fairly well fleshed out, and Kelsier for the most part was as well, but the rest of the characters were just faces and names. Outside of the magic system, this was pretty standard fantasy fair. It comes complete with an evil ruler oppressing the land, a thief turned hero seeking vengeance on said evil ruler for past injustices, and a lowly street urchin with great powers unknown to her. While there was nothing spectacular about this novel, it was a fun read and the ending was satisfying and stood above the rest of the story in my eyes.
B0044KU7EQ|4.0|An amazing collection, and an amazing value.  But other than the discs themselves, there's not much here.  No musician credits, no dates or discography, sloppy and badly written commentary, and (worst of all) consistently wrong songwriting credits.  I'm sure it will come as a surprise to Clarence Carter's ghost that Mary Lou Reed wrote I Ain't Got You (and Big Boss Man as well).  But at seventy-odd bucks for 52 full discs of classic blues, it's tough to complain.
0140157352|5.0|I find myself looking at this book from my shelf on management and negotiation.<br /><br />I think the ideas, thoughts, and suggestions are easy to read and worthy of consideration. For the value of the book (very inexpensive) and the flow of the book it is an easy recommendation if you enjoy the genre of such literature.<br /><br />I liked/like the idea of \\"Separate the People from the Problem\\" and am currently dealing with a problem with Mitsubishi Motors charging me over $1000 dollars to repair a short with the horn in my car. I want to be a good customer - and need to respect the individuals, but need to be firm. A short which the sales manager agrees \\"should\\" only costs labor fees to repair will cost over a thousand as they need to replace the air-bag system? I am maintaining a stern stance and found myself playing against a player that doesn't want to play. I selected to review this book now as I find myself revisiting this book to help me deal with Mitsubishis apparent lack of integrity.<br /><br />As a manager it must be useful, as a consumer and player on the stage in this game of life, it can be useful.
1401324029|4.0|This book was good, though not great.  It was, however, in my opinion, better than the first one -- Heat Wave.  I am looking forward to the next one.
B00139XTG4|1.0|There are one or two good ideas and concepts in this book but by the time you finish reading this book you will forget it. The author is busy criticizing other successful economists and belittling their success. Every other line he will keep saying that using Gaussian distribution is a stupid idea.    I like books which take a central concept and take pains to explain well to the readers. Mr Taleb should first read a book like \\"Made to Stick - by Chip and Dan Heath\\" and learn how to communicate ideas.    The worst part of the book is Mr. Taleb's arrogance and snobbishness which come across loud and clear in every page. He seems to think that he deserves a Nobel prize, That sure will be a negative \\"black swan\\" event.    Don't waste your valuable time and money!

B003EYVXTG|4.0|The jacket on this disc is misleading. The movie is characterized as a thriller and a mystery. It's neither. It's more of a Missouri Ozarks odyssey, with almost a documentary feel to it, vaguely reminiscent of John Sayles' \\"Matewan.\\" However, this film isn't about miners. It' about ordinary mountain people and their struggle to survive.    It reveals the seldom-explored lives of these people. However, far from this rural town being a benign and gently humorous Mayberry, this film reveals life in such mountain settings as being often difficult, decimated, and brutalized by the role that drug-dealing has come to play among the inhabitants as a way of sustaining themselves.     The central character in this story is a 17-year-old girl who circulates among the distanced people of this enclave, looking for her father whom she suspects has been driven into hiding as a result of his \\"cookin'\\" - meaning his cooking of crystal meth. Meth seems to have taken the place of the more amusing moonshine that used to characterize mountain entrepreneurship. There's an urgency to the girl's search. Unless her father shows up for his court hearing, his bond will be forfeit and the girl and her family will lose their house, the one thing that secures them in place.    This film is beautifully photographed. I especially appreciated seeing the strong, unvarnished women's faces that it features. These faces, allowed to be present without the concealments and erasures of botox or blush, tell the story of the hardships these women have suffered. They are intrinsically beautiful faces.     The main failing of this film is that its plot doesn't make much sense. Perhaps something got lost in translation from the acclaimed book to the screen. The violence in the movie seems to be dragged in out of left field. It's as if the producers feared that a mere representation of a girl's quest for her father would be too boring. So they threw in some sudden, unmotivated mob violence against her. Why would her neighbors turn on her that way? Is it that they feared she would tell the town sheriff about their own complicity in the drug trade? Is it that they feared she would somehow betray the fierce loyalties that bind the people in this area? Maybe, but these hardly seem like adequate explanations for their threatening descent on her, like the villagers' descent on Dr. Frankenstein's castle with torches.    Then the girl's reaction to the vicissitudes of her odyssey is a constant blank impassivity. Jennifer Lawrence registers neither fear nor fondness. So her character's courage ends up looking more like simple indifference. I don't know if this is due to bad acting or bad directing.    But these flaws end up being relatively minor detractions from what is overall a beautiful, absorbing drama about the persistence of a rural refuge that few outsiders would otherwise get to visit.    One final reason to get this DVD is the thread of traditional bluegrass music that runs through it, making up its score. It's a rare treat to hear raw, honest voices intoning these time-honored tunes in our age of generally over-produced, over-amplified video extravaganzas. Here music literally is brought back to its roots as a homespun, intimate activity - back to where the singer and the song are one. The entire expanded score for the film is available as a separate CD/record.
B000YMWDEU|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time.  When I first heard it, I was extremely surprised because I have a low tolerance for unclean vocals.  However, there is a perfect mix of screaming and clean singing and you can feel the emotion that is put into the vocals as well as the music.  I absolutely love the entire album from start to finish and highly recommend it.

0439023513|5.0|I thought all of the books were awesome.  I'm not sure why some readers were so disappointed in the ending.  Maybe they wanted Katniss to end up with someone else other than the one she ended up with.  I loved the idea of Katniss in real battle.  The last 100 pages were nonstop, intense action.  I started the first book just a few weeks ago and if ithadn't been for work, i would have finished the whole series in a few days.  I feel another void in my life now that another great series is over.

He remember them all from older movies and the more recent ones also.  Plenty of action and a side to be on all the way through.  It sure feels good when you can root for the good guys.  I'm sure we'll be watching it over and over again.
0743454537|5.0|This was the first Jodi Picoult book I read, and it was wonderful.  Every character (except perhaps the son/brother) perfectly portrayed and developed.  A plot that raises questions in a series of layers that keep you thinking and considering the rightness of the parents' decisions and actions.  And, in the end, a tying together of all the threads in a way that is as simple and satisfying as a good dessert.  If you read this book you won't soon forget it.
B001UV4XFQ|3.0|Eclipse was more action packed than the others before it, but it still for some reason left me a little flat.  You just seemed to keep say to the actors ( Bite her already ).  We did buy it, and will probably watch it again some time, but it won't be at the top of our list when we search for a movie to watch.  I am glad I have the set just in case.

1400052173|5.0|I cannot say enough great things about this book. The story, the writing, everything about it is simply incredible. This tribute to Henrietta Lacks and her family was so very long overdue. It's amazing how such an incredible story was not told earlier given what a pivotal impact Henrietta indirectly made on every single one of us. Thank you Ms. Skloot for sharing this fascinating story with us and for giving Henrietta Lacks and her family at least some of the recognition they so deserve. In addition to the fascinating story that we are all linked to in one way or another, this book is intellectually rich, touching on a myriad subjects including, medical ethics, racial equality, political history, family dynamics, and so much more.

What will last is the ways you've affected and touched other people. Human relationships are more important than modern gadgets, brand names, and becoming obsessed with the pettiness of life.

030746363X|5.0|This book is a reference material meant to be used in sections like an encyclopedia or cookbook. But I ended up reading the whole thing in two days because it was all such great information. Ferriss rips apart hype and faulty research then takes a \\"reductionist\\" approach to nearly everything about the human body from health to weight loss to exercise, bodybuilding, powerlifting, sports, sex, food, drink, you name it. It breaks all these issues down to the 2 to 4 most important things to always remember, which makes it really easy to be very good to your body about 95% of the time. I've dropped a bunch of fat, built more muscle than I would have ever guessed and felt like a million bucks for the past 2 and a half weeks...all the while really eating dang near everything I wanted. I think it's uber-cool. Plus the guy who wrote it is a very brilliant young man who went to Princeton and has a phenomenal philosophy on life that he put in writing in a book called \\"The 4 Hour Work Week.\\" I'm in the middle of it now, and it's fantastic as well. Highly recommend them both and hope you enjoy them as much as I have.  ~Dan
0316098337|1.0|My book club is discussing this book and I was looking forward to reading it.  However, now that I have, I found the book disturbing not because of the content but because it feels like the author stole the story from the newspaper headlines.  It felt more like I was watching an episode of Oprah than a good piece of prose.  It has that same voyeuristic quality.        I couldn't find anything unique about this book.  Everything felt like I had seen it in the news or read it previously.  Reading from the POV of Jack was interesting for the first 20-30 pages then got fairly annoying.  I did like Ma.  She was the only interesting character in the book.  The rest of the family members just didn't seem authentic.      The author claims to have done serious research for this book but I didn't read anything that suggested that.  The story has little depth.

My only hesitation or something readers should consider (after reading \\"The Drunkards Walk\\" another 5 star book) is that many experiments took place with only relatively small focus groups mainly uni students mono culture and past research shows that this can be biased. However Dan  often uses these anecdotally  to open each chapter and then goes onto more info and research substantiating his key points to be very convincing.
B003FMTZOM|3.0|I don't know if she was born with it or if vocal lessons or choirs cultivated it, but Christina Aguilera has a dynamite singing voice. Not only that, her voice has personality because she can sing pop, rock, gospel or any genre of music and make it sound wonderful. I just love her voice; loved it since the \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" days. But oh how things have changed since \\"Genie in a Bottle.\\" She has reinvented herself time and again. To describe her in two words, I would say talented and creative. I just finished listening to \\"Bionic\\", (great title) and it is just all over the place, especially as far as instrumentation is concerned. The album is 79 minutes, but I wanted more. She definitely did not give me enough vocally. These songs were not meant to showcase her singing voice. These songs were created in an effort to show her versatility, and I respect that, but I could not get into the album as a whole, so I granted it 3 stars.<br /><br />For the most part, this is an upbeat album. I would even say it is a concept album because it's influenced so much by futuristic/electronic sounds. For example, the albums title track. \\"Bionic\\" and \\"Elastic Love\\" are both heavily influenced by the electronica sound. I can say that I do not like this for Christina. When Christina is doing R&B, pop and ballads, that's when I am all into her because I can actually hear that great voice. When she performs ballads, she puts so much emotion into her songs that it's unforgettable. It sends chills through the listener. The only time we get that on \\"Bionic\\" is on \\"Lift Me Up\\", a fine moment on this album. The albums real highlight, though, is \\"Sex for Breakfast.\\" As soon as I heard it, I added it to my iPod at once and played it repeatedly. This track is sensual and very likable. \\"Glam\\" is just an updated version of Madonna's \\"Vogue.\\" Simply put, it's an ode to make-up and fashion. Overall, it's a cute song.<br /><br />In conclusion, this album is an acquired taste. Buy it if you are into lengthy albums (AKA getting your moneys worth), the electronica sound, and/or pop.<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br /><br />1. \\"Sex for Breakfast\\"<br />2. \\"Lift Me Up\\"<br />3. \\"Making Dessert\\"<br />4. \\"I Am\\"<br />5. \\"Glam\\"AKA getting your moneys worth), the electronica sound, and/or pop.

1600242405|5.0|Two notes, then three notes, rising: I know where I am, and I know where we're going: the band is the engine, the audience is the fuel, and we are all in res media with a vengeance. . . maybe Jagger can't get no Satisfaction, but we will.    This is the heart of Keith Richards' LIFE.  The ability to create a rocket and get us all on board had shaped his life, made him even as he made the music.    From a couple of kids with blues on the brain to a longevity nobody could ever have expected, the perfect synthesis of talents and creativity have produced a prodigious career.  Keith is willing, and more interestingly, able to take us for this ride with him, just as he does when performing onstage.  Listening to his narration is like co-inhabiting his skull for the duration.  He tells his story with the same red-line generosity with which he performs.    Drugs?  Yes, but they were never really what Keef WAS, merely what he DID.  We get a remarkably clear-eyed profit-and-loss statement of both excess and expectations, as he put the \\"he\\" into hedonism.  But always, sitting at the core of him, was the music. He orbited that, not the substances, not the destruction, not the fame.    He was expected to be one of the dead talents of rock. He would have been in very good company.  Instead, here he is, long-married, fatherly, living in Connecticutt, apparently stable as bedrock, reporting from the front in a voice warmed by humor, edged with immediacy.    Go along for the ride: you'll never get a better one.
142311339X|5.0|The long awaited sequel to the Percy Jackson and the Olympian series, The Lost Hero, does not disappoint the rabid fanatics of the previous series, me being one of them. It is book one of the new series by Rick Riordan: Heroes of Olympus, and it may be one of Rick Riordan's best work. It seemed to cast a spell on me from the very beginning until the end. The book brings the readers back into the world of Greek mythology, and still includes some of the characters from the previous Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. It also introduces some very well developed new characters. In the world created by Rick Riordan, Greek gods and goddesses are very real. They rule the world from Mount Olympus and each god controls a various aspect of the world. For example, Zeus, king of the gods, controls the skies and lightning and Poseidon controls the seas. However, occasionally these gods and goddesses fall in love with a mortal and have children with them. These are the protagonists of Heroes of Olympus. They are called demigods which means half mortal and half god. In the previous series the main protagonist is Percy Jackson, who is the son of Poseidon: God of the Seas. In The Lost Hero, Percy is discovered missing for three days and his girlfriend, Annabeth is frantically searching for him.     The story begins by introducing three new characters: Jason, Piper, and Leo. They all go to a boarding school for \\"unstable\\" children called The Wilderness School.  Jason is a very muscular and handsome boy and is the main demigod in The Lost Hero. Piper is a girl who is extremely breathtaking, even without make up. She is shy, but as later shown in the book by her actions, very courageous. She has a crush on Jason and at the beginning of the book they are a couple. Leo is Jason's best friend who has a very strong sense of humor, but can also be a bit annoying sometimes.   At the beginning of the book Jason Piper, and Leo are on the bus to a field trip to the Grand Canyon. Jason has no idea how he got there and cannot remember anything of his past. Piper and Leo are very puzzled by this and think he is joking at first. Then they realize that he is serious and are flabbergasted. At the end of the field trip, they are attacked by a group of storm spirits which are a part of Greek mythology. Their chaperone and gym teacher, Coach Hedge, turns out to be a satyr. This is the Greek term for a creature that is half man, half goat. Jason, Piper, and Leo are dazed and shocked by this, but have to deal with the threat at hand. In the end, Coach Hedge sacrifices himself so that Jason, Piper, and Leo can escape. Moments after the storm spirits and Coach Hedge disappear, a girl with blonde hair and storm gray eyes appears above them flying on a chariot. She introduces herself to them as Annabeth, a character from the previous Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. She is the daughter of Athena, the goddess of wisdom. She explains to them what their true identities are: Demigods. She also explains that in order for them to be safe from monsters such as the storm spirits, she has to take them to a special camp for Demigods like them. It is called Camp Half-Blood. This is where Demigods train to fight monsters like storm spirits and are sent on heroic quests to save the world. After nearly facing death, the three of them gladly allow themselves to be whisked off to the safety of Camp Half-Blood. Once there, they find hundreds of Demigods all with different godly parents. They each have unique powers depending on their parent. For example, the sons of Zeus have the power to control the air around them and summon lightning. It is later revealed that Jason is a son of Zeus, Piper a daughter of Aphrodite, and Leo is a son of Hephaestus. Aphrodite is the goddess of love and beauty and Hephaestus is the god of the forge and engineering. After they settle in at Camp Half-Blood, they discover that Hera, goddess of marriage, has been kidnapped. Jason, Piper, and Leo are then sent on a quest to rescue her. However, Piper has a secret that she cannot reveal to the other two which causes an extremely interesting plot twist at the end and completely changes the course of their quest. At the end of the quest, Jason finally discovers his true identity and how he came to Piper and Leo. He also has a very good guess as to where Percy Jackson has disappeared to.    It is a complex book in terms of the plot and is truly unpredictable. It is chalk full of lies, betrayals, courageous acts, and many plot twists. By the end of the book, Riordan introduces a whole new side to the world of Greek mythology that he created. It leaves us with endless possibilities.    I can honestly say that it is the best book I have read all year and am counting down the days until the sequel comes out. The book surprisingly made me laugh at many points out loud, which books do not often do. At the same time, there were points where my heart started thumping against my chest because of the suspense. It is a wild roller-coaster ride that was very refreshing after reading many disappointing and boring fiction books.    Another great thing about this book is that even though these Demigods are off on a quest that determines the fate of the world, there are still moments where I am reminded that they are also normal teenagers. I found that I could relate to some of their conflicts in the book. For example, when Piper started feeling guilty about keeping her secret from her two friends, I was reminded of many times when I kept secrets from my friends and the guilt I felt from not telling them. Riordan captures emotions very well, without the use of complex words. This is one of my favorite things about the book.    Another great thing about the book is just how interesting the world of Greek mythology Riordan creates is. It is simply genius. He creates a world where a civilization as old as the Greeks is incorporated with the twenty-first century. I think teenagers around my age would greatly enjoy this book as almost all the characters of the book are our age. They are incredibly complex at times, yet Riordan conveys their feelings with ease. It is very comparable to the Harry Potter series. In both series, teenagers are suddenly whisked off to learn their true magical identities and begin a new life in a place such as Hogwarts or Camp Half-Blood.   Overall, I strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy and kids around my age. It is an action packed book that is extremely unpredictable and, for the most part, is an easy read. In other words, it is just the kind of book kids my age would enjoy the most. I think it rightfully earns a place next to Harry Potter and many others as one of the greatest children fantasy books.
B0000025D0|4.0|This was the 2nd Bruce album i got into (after Born to run)when discovering him back in 1980.   Ive always regarded it as in the top 3 or 4 albums of his career; Its a fine album to start youre Springsteen collection with ( indeed BADLANDS, RACING IN THE STREET, PROVE IT ALL NIGHT .DARKNESS,have become the backbone of his shows over the last 30 years!!)The thing that stops  me  giving it 5 stars is the production itself (something that i feel that has blighted Bruce's earlier albums right up to BORN IN THE USA )not even the recently recently remastered version has changed my mind! It was through collecting Springsteens live shows  over the years that i realised that many of the songs on this (and other albums)  sound a little stale (exceptions here  being CANDYS ROOM, RACING IN THE STREET, FACTORY and STREETS OF FIRE ) compared to their live versions. BADLANDS ( LIVE 1980 onwards) and the title track in particular  highlight this. In many ways this reflects what a phenonomal live performer Springsteen has been, so this may sound a little harsh.I would suggest however, that anyone buying this album to check out the live albums and dvds to hear many of these songs at their best. This is classic stuff a must for Bruce fans.

1439107955|5.0|Nearly two years ago, at age 20, I was diagnosed with leukemia.  I relocated back home from college and immediately began nine months of intensive chemotherapy.  I was quickly in remission and have been on maintenance therapy for over a year now.    I have never been someone very interested in the scientific world. It is very unlikely that prior to being diagnosed with cancer that I would have ever glanced at this book, let alone have read it.    But, \\"leukemia is like that... it changes your life.\\"    I didn't have much interest in learning about the disease at first.  All I wanted from my doctors was the bottom line: how I rid myself of the cancer, how I avoid the side effects, how I escape the confines of the pediatric oncology floor.    One of the cancer social networks that I follow originally posted an NPR story about this book.  Then I saw the New York Times piece.  I finally typed in the title to Amazon and read the introduction, which was available for free. The way the author spoke about Carla, who happened to have the same diagnosis as me, instantly grabbed my attention.    Whether or not it was just a matter of time before I was ready to intellectually confront the disease which has consumed much of my life for the past two years, I'm not sure. I had already confronted it physically and emotionally.  Perhaps it was just a random set of events that led me to purchase this book.  Regardless, once I received it, I couldn't set it down.  I was acutely and passionately enthralled with learning: taking notes of poignant quotes I identified with, writing down questions for my doctors, and reading aloud parts to my family that I thought they would find interesting.    I was very impressed by the text.  Not only for the compelling way the author writes about everything from his relationship with patients to complex genetic theories, but for encapsulating so much of what I was curious about, as a patient, in a single book.  For me, it answered so much of what I wanted to know... not only about the causes, the history, the biology, and the chemistry of cancer - which it did - but about the fears and hopes concerning my own diagnosis and the future of cancer treatment.    I can only imagine how much time, blood, sweat, and tears went into creating The Emperor of All Maladies.  What I do know is that it had a deep and positive influence on my life.
B0041T52S6|1.0|This movie is THE WORST movie I've ever seen. I saw all the good reviews and decided to watch it because it sounded like a really good comedy. I didn't laugh one time during this movie and I thought its attempt to humor failed miserably. I can't believe I wasted a dollar renting it and I also can't believe I watched it all the way through. It blows my mind as to how many people actually liked this movie. K.O.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I could not believe that I have remembered at least bits of every episode I've viewed so far (seasons 1, 2, and 1 disc of 3).  While I've been told the Blu-ray allows you to see the non-enhanced and the enhanced, I believe the effects on the DVD version are subtle enough to not detract from the show's intent but lively enough to add some punch to the visual senses.  I am glad I waited for this and I am glad it has been released.
1897093616|2.0|I had to read Treasure Island for class. The book was published in 1883. The main character,Jim, suffers losses at an early age. This influences him to go on a ship to find Captain Flint's treasure. There are several people on this ship, some that Jim can trust can some that he really shouldn't. Some of these people use others just to get what they want. I did not like the book at all. It could not keep my attention. I found the book quite boring. The wording is confusing and I had somewhat of a hard time reading the story and fully understanding it. It took me a while to finish the book because I just could not read it. Personally it has way too much violence for me. But, it does teach good life lessons such as,be careful who you trust,some people will do anything for money,and many more. All of the problems helped the main character learn these lessons. I would not suggest this book to young children or people who don't like violence and pirates.
0439023513|4.0|The finale of the Hunger Games series really delivered. It is very dark, which I guess was to be expected given where Catching Fire left off. That said, it has the trademark elements of great plot combined with really amazing and complicated characters. Katniss continues her struggles on two fronts: (1) destroy the Capitol vs. protect family and loved ones and (2) Gale vs. Peeta. Both struggles are resolved in a way that is entirely consistent with the preceding books in the series and yet well advanced from where the story started. This is truly an exceptional series in originality, characters, writing and overall reader enjoyability.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Book was good after it got going. The beginning is a bit slow but after the story picks up and starts connecting, it becomes a lot smoother read.
159448385X|5.0|I read The Kite Runner and loved it. I was skeptical that this second book by Hosseini would be able to match the emotional force of the first one. To my surprise, I liked this one even better. It chronicles two generations of women in war-torn Afghanistan.  Like The Kite Runner, it was incredibly depressing but emotionally and brutally honest about the plight of women in Afghanistan. In my view, the subject matter was more sweeping and the message was broader in this book without being too general or losing the power created by characters that you can't turn away from. The book was both educational and horizon-expanding about a culture that most people view only through the lens of terrorism. Not the best book to read on the beach during a vacation, but well worth reading in any other context.
0470876417|3.0|This book is beautifully laid out and illustrated and the writing style is compelling.    If you're a college grad or first/second year web person, the book is great for you. Anyone with more experience, however, should avoid it. The concepts (building a platform, for example) are so basic and straight forward, that there's really no new information here that you can't learn by reading Techcrunch or completing an online MBA. The case studies, although great examples of each of the points, have been repeated ten times over (i.e. Apple releasing iTunes and the App Store).    I heard about the book from Steve Blank, who described it as an essential compendium to 'Four Steps to the Epiphany.' I would agree, if this is your first business. Otherwise, steer clear.
0553381695|5.0|This series is fantastic. It centers on a fictional kingdom with some similarities to early Britain in terms of the structure of society.  This book is as rich and well plotted as the first book. The story is so compelling, focusing in this novel on six different factions that are seeking the throne in the wake of the death of Robert Baratheon. Although the plot is riveting, for me the real appeal of the series is the intensely complex group of characters, none of whom are wholly good or wholly evil (although some come close on both sides of the spectrum). This is George R.R. Martin's Lord of the Rings, although it is wholly unique in its own right. I can't wait to see what happens next.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|This is Boston's best album.  This album struck a chord in 1976, just a great arena rock album, that still gets plenty of airplay today!  You can get tired of hearing the same songs over and over again on classic rock radio, but I don't listen to at months at a time, and the songs still sound fresh.  Formed in 1971, Boston released this this  in 1976, led by studio maven Tom Scholz, vocalist the late Brad Delp, guitarist Barry Goudreau, bassist Fran Sheehan and drummer John 'Sib' Hashian.  This album is chalk full of anthems like, \\"More than A Feeling\\", #5, I still love this song today, the melody is something else.  \\"Piece Of Mind\\", #38 and \\"\\"Foreplay/Long Time\\" #22, two great singles that still resonate today.  Other tracks that rule \\"Rock 'N Roll Band\\", \\"Smokin'\\", \\"Something About You\\", \\"Let Me Take You Home Tonight\\" and a song that doesn't get it's due \\"Hitch A Ride\\".  35 years on, this album still ROCKS!
0786891084|4.0|This is a fun, light read with a \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" type plot. It is creatively written in a series of emails, letters, text messages and journal entries between Rosie and her long-time male friend.  You have to really get used to the style in the beginning but the format does not prevent the narrative from flowing really well, nor does it prevent strong character development. This is a great beach read or a good choice for anyone who likes a light, happy book that will put a smile on your face.
B000EQ47HC|5.0|This is Boston's second release.  \\"Don't Look Back\\" #1, should of just been on their first album, great songs and great production.  The hits here were, \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\", #31 a great ballad rocker, the title track #4, which was one of my favorite tunes my last year in high school and \\"Feelin' Satisfied\\", #46 another favorite, which should of done better on the charts.  Other great songs include \\"Party\\", the great \\"It's Easy\\", \\"Used To Bad News\\" and a song that doesn't get enough respect \\"Don't Be Afraid\\".  It took Boston 8 years to release \\"Third Stage\\", in 1986.
0786868724|4.0|This book tracks the author's friendship with his childhood rabbi, who unexpectedly asks him to give the eulogy when he dies.  This odd request sparks a deep, abiding friendship for years to come and causes the author to reevaluate his faith along the way.  I didn't expect to enjoy this book as much as I did. It was heartfelt without being sappy, contemplative and full of faith without being preachy, and introspective without being arrogant or pretentious. The best kind of book makes you think about things in a fresh way...and this book accomplished that.
B000002O51|3.0|Not a bad record by Boston, but it took eight years for this?  \\"Amanda\\"#1 is just a poor single, don't even listen to it anymore.  I still enjoy \\"We're Ready\\" #9 mainstream rock, \\"I Think I Like It\\", the melody is perfect, and the great \\"Can'tcha Say (You Believe In Me)/Still In Love\\" #20 on the 100.  \\"Cool The Engines\\", hit #9 on the 100, but i've cooled of this tune over the years.  Without Fran, Barry and Sib Boston was missing some key parts.  \\"Walk On\\", came on in 1994, at the heighth of grunge.

0307454541|3.0|This is an easy mystery with which to wallow the time, though I have no idea what all the hoopla is about.  It is a self consistent mystery in that all the i's are dotted and everything fits well together, so in that sense it is satisfying.  Those of us who read mysteries are looking for some kind of order in the world, and this delivers it since all the good guys win and the bad guys lose big. However, Steig's characters are exceptionally one-dimensional and quite frankly, all of them, totally unbelievable.  That being said, if one is looking for an easy book to read at bed-time or on the beach, this fits the bill.  I read it on a Kindle and it was very easy reading.
0439023491|5.0|CATCHING FIRE, the second book in the Hunger Games trilogy, is just as good as the first, HUNGER GAMES.  This is a series parents and children can both read, with lots of talking points. If you've got a kid who loves to read, or a child you wish loved to read, be they male or female, this is a series you should read together. CATCHING FIRE, with its depiction of the perils of fame, is especially important in a world where the media tells kids being famous is the way to get what you want.<br /><br />Because sometimes - maybe even most of the time - it isn't.

B003UESJH4|5.0|A feisty and peculiar Aussie helps a depressed and anxious Royal overcome a disability to fulfill his historic destiny and become King of the British Empire during an international crisis.<br /><br />That's the synopsis but really this film is so much more.<br /><br />The story is an obvious vehicle for Geoffrey Rush who plays the real life Lionel Logue, an Australian failed actor-wannabe and speech therapist of questionable credentials. Using nontraditional methods based on his observation of shell shocked WW1 veterans, Logue \\"cures\\" King George Vl (Colin Firth) of the stammer he had since childhood. This embarrassing disability prevents the king from communicating properly and authoritatively as his nation's leader.<br /><br />Set against the sweeping history of the period, the onset of the Nazi party in Germany, the world on the brink of a second war, the abdication of older brother King Edward Vlll (Guy Pearce) to marry the twice divorced Wallis Simpson (Eve Best), the advent of radio technology to inform and lead the public, the movie moves easily between story line and historical events.<br /><br />The lives of the two main characters: the insecure Prince Albert of York, (the second son of King George V and the future King George Vl) and the colonial commoner from Australia are strikingly contrasted to show the vast differences and similarities between the two men. Royal/commoner, unlimited wealth and privilege/middle class-bohemian, British/Australian, uptight and constrained/free spirited and relaxed, the two men are able to find enough commonalities to eventually become trusted friends.<br /><br />The parts are extremely well acted by a large cast of veteran actors. Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter (The Duchess of York) are particularly convincing.<br /><br />All in all, several hours well spent.
1416972250|5.0|This one was amazing! I love it! I was on the verge of tears in some parts. Laughing hard in a few parts but most of all I was shocked. There was a few things I had figured out before they were truly revealed but also was suprised by a few others. This one was the best because so many questions were answered. It was much darker. A little scary at times. And was certainly sexy. Addictive and I was so happy with the outcome of Jace, Clary, and Simon. Although I know Simon has much more work to do. In that he will play a really big part in the next book. Everyone did grow alot in this one.<br /><br />I have to say the beginning towards the middle Clary really got on my nerves with her acting completely clueless with the dangers and consequences of her choices. Her selfishness. As if she was literally just thrust into this world without knowing the things that exist and what things they were up against. She was very careless and I just wanted to slap her. But she got with the program and was able to redeem herself. So I'm glad and back to loving her. I never felt sorry for Valentine, not once. So I was more than pleased with his outcome. Jace of course I felt the most for I really did. But I'm so happy for him. Discovering his truth that was so unjustly taken away from him and the blessings he discovered and received along the way. This 3rd book in this series was awesome and ended on a bittersweet note. I highly recommend this series and I can't wait to read \\"City of Fallen Angels\\" the 4th book.

B000I2J6K0|5.0|I used this video in my first pregnancy. It was difficult then, but I liked it. I couldn't do the entire workout, but I could do most of it. I skipped through the few parts that were difficult for me at the time. This 2nd pregnancy, I had already been working out to Erin O'Brien's Strong Body, Ageless Body, and I started Prenatal Fitness Fix at about 9 weeks pregnant. I can do all of the exercises this time. I'm glad I started this workout so early in pregnancy. :-) This is by far my favorite pregnancy workout. I am building muscle and I feel strong.    That said, I can see where folks think this is not necessarily geared toward beginners. I personally think that's great because those intermediate and advanced among us need challenging prenatal workouts. I have Denise Austin's prenatal workout and also Fit Mama by Leisa Hart, both of which I find to be way too easy. Prenatal Fitness Fix is realistically challenging.     Many reviewers talk about how there isn't much upper body work in this workout. This is where the 20 minute partner workout comes in. Seriously. There are several exercises for the upper body using the resistance of your partner. The partner workout is my favorite part of the entire workout, so please don't hesitate to try it. It does the *most* for me physically and makes me feel super strong. Plus, it's fun. Admittedly, I felt a little awkward initially pulling my partner in to work out with me, or to serve as my prop. I waited until I could do the entire 40 minute segment without difficulty first. But when we did the partner workout for the first time, we both enjoyed it and the time flew by. This segment of the workout really compliments the main 40 minute section. Again, it's my favorite part of the video and it's where the extra arm work is that so many feel is lacking in the 40 minute workout. Try it. My husband even enjoyed it, and it helped to involve him in the pregnancy, and to feel that he is supporting me in remaining healthy and fit.I actually liked the very things other reviewers have complained about. It's not about hype. It's about exercising in our homes, in order to have a healthy pregnancy. This video is simple. It takes place in a living room. It's relaxing and calming. It's real. And it's motivating and inspiring.
0307408833|3.0|As other reviewers have noted, the subtitle of this book is misleading.  It says, \\"Vegan, Gluten-Free, and (Mostly) Sugar-Free Recipes...\\"  That would lead one to believe that all of the recipes are gluten-free, which is not the case.  (They are all vegan, though.)  About half of the muffins, ALL of the biscuits and scones, and half of the pies & cobblers contain spelt flour, along with the occasional item from the chapters in between.  (Be careful to watch for recipes that include other sub-recipes, like the Red Velvet Crumb Base.)  the introduction to the book makes it clear that they aren't all gluten-free, but this is not apparent from the cover.<br /><br />The recipes also rely heavily on agave nectar (just about the only sweetener in the book), which is controversial, health-wise.  [[ASIN:B000ED7M3Q Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose Gluten-Free Baking Flour]], coconut flour, and coconut oil will also be definite must-have's if you are to make much from this book.  Overall, though, the author seems to have done an amazing job creating recipes free of eggs, dairy, and often wheat, while still maintaining  \\"normal\\" textures and flavors.  Soy is rarely used (amazing, for a vegan cookbook!) and, where it is, there is usually an alternative offered in the notes.<br /><br />I gleaned a few things from this book, but I probably wouldn't use it on a weekly basis.  If you're considering it, you might want to get it from your library before investing in your own copy.

B003INJETO|3.0|I'm a big fan of Pain of Salvation's earlier work. While I think their past couple of albums were a bit uneven, last year's live DVD reminded me how great this band can be and I was looking forward to this album. Knowing that a Pain of Salvation album can take quite a few listens to really \\"get\\", I've held off on writing a review until I could digest it for a few months. Unfortunately I still don't think Road Salt One is is the same league as some of their earlier work, particularly the Perfect Element One and Remedy Lane.    As is typical for Pain of Salvation, this album is stylistically different from their other work - though Road Salt One is perhaps their most significant departure yet. Gone is the \\"metal\\" sound from most of their previous work; instead this album attempts to imitate a 70's vibe (the sound reminds me a lot of Lenny Kravitz). Unfortunately I don't think they succeed very well, and it sounds forced and somehow \\"off\\". There also doesn't seem to be as much variety as on their earlier albums, and no real stand-out tracks, with the possible exception of the title track.    Overall, while this isn't a bad album by any means, I think it is far short of what this band is capable of.
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|Let me first put it out there that, of course, I'm a big fan of the original Evangelion series, like millions are. The faithful day I saw a small, Japanese trailer for this was around late 2007. I got extremely excited about it, but totally forget about it because it tended to stay of the U.S. radar for anime. Not only that, but either FUNimation sat on it for so long or had some form of an issue, it took forever to get licensed and dubbed.    I see for some odd reason people seem to think this title was unnecessary, and probably a way to just let some companies make money off of Evangelion's name. I wonder to myself why people seem to think Evangelion 1.11 is gonna just be a stand-alone movie, and have no sequel come off it, and ultimately, not get any further than the original. This is indeed a 4-film tetralogy. The point of this whole project is for it come to fruition like Hideaki Anno first wanted it to, and now he has the chance to make it happen.    I'm just gonna make this a short winded, simple review, now. I got Evangelion 1.01 over Christmas of '09 and I couldn't wait to watch it. I popped it in around mid-January, and I was blown away. Beautiful, crisp animation. While I'm not a fan of CG, they did incorporate it well. Stuck mostly to it's OST, which is grand, because it's wonderful. I gotta say, though, there is NO WAY FUNimation didn't know anything about the darkness issue before releasing it. Were they just trying to make money by re-releasing it as this title? I don't know. Anywho, if you're a loyal fan and you were upset about the direction this movie took, what did you expect? Why stray away from the very roots that made this series what it was AND is? And while I'll agree that the changes in this film were few, they were major. So, if you're expecting to dive head first into this movie expecting every single detail to be different, you'll be dissapointed. All I can say is: this was my movie experience of 2010, and honestly, the best movie I've seen in a long time. While I'm glad the changes in here were minor, we'll see what the 2nd film has in store plot-wise. I recommend this to any Evangelion fan or anime fan in general. Incredible experience.
0810983915|5.0|Dog Days, it's not about dogs. It's the 4th Diary of a Wimpy Kid and its awesome! Wow! You should read this book because it can make you laugh! The title of the book is Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days. The author is Jeff Kinney. Realistic fiction is the genre of my book. The main characters are Greg, Mom, Dad, Rodrick, Manny, and Rowley. The setting is school, home, and outside in the park.     There are a lot of things that happen in the book. My favorite part is when Greg and his family went to the beach because I love going to the beach. My other favorite part is when Rodrick pushes Greg into the pool because I love going to the pool.    A positive thing in Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days is that it's funny because it kept making me laugh! It kept me wondering what's going to happen next! Some of the negative things about my book. The book is long and it took me a long time to finish the book! I recommend this book because it's a good book. I gave Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days five stars because it's my favorite book!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is my favorite book of all time! I read it in like a week. If yu are the kind of person that loves advemture and suspense than this book is right for you. The story contains adventure, love, and suspense.  fell in love with this book and you will too!
0810993139|4.0|The good book I am talking about is exciting fabulous and terrific.    I could not put it down I hope you can't either. Diary of a Wimpy kid is the book I am talking about and the author is Jeff Kinney.  The main charters are Greg Heffley and Rowley Jefferson Its settings are Greg's school his house and Rowley's house.    My favorite part about the book is the part when Rowley broke his arm because Greg through a ball at him. My other favorite part is when Greg and Rowley got in a fight and didn't not talk to each other.    Some good things about the book it is Hilarious and fabulous because Greg's dad got him a weight set that he doesn't want.    The bad things are way to chatty because if someone start's talking they wont stop no matter what it is funny.  I rated 4 stars.
B001UV4XFQ|2.0|The movie is great. But I really hate the single disc. The 2 disc edition was not available at the only local store in my little town.
0810994739|5.0|Have you ever written in a diary? The title of my book is Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rule. The author is Jeff Kinney. The genre of my book is realistic fiction. The story is all about Greg and his older brother Rodrick. His older brother does mean stuff to him.     My favorite part is when Rodrick has a party.  My other favorite part is when Greg gets locked in the basement.     A thing about the book is that it was really good. And the ending made me read the Last Straw. I give the book 5 stars.
B000NYT1M6|4.0|This was a handsome, nice truck.  Not sure it was worth the price.  Plastic just won't hold up like the older toys that were made of metal.  It is shame everything is plastic.  I don't think it will hold up to rough play.
0763637084|5.0|Carrots carrots do you like carrots? Lola hates carrots so much.  I Will Never, Not Ever Eat A Tomato is written by Lauren child. This is fiction because it doesn't have real characters.  Lola, Charile, Mom, Dad are the characters in the book. Lola's house is the setting of the book.    My favorite part is when Lola doesn't like vegetables. Lola doesn't like carrots, peas, potato and tomatos. My other favorite part is when Lola likes mermaids. Charlie tricks Lola to eat mermaid food. Mermaid food is fish sticks. At the beginning, of the story she didn't like fish sticks.    The positive thing is the characters are funny because they say funny stuff like Lola is a fussy eater. The negative thing is when Charlie tricks Lola to eat peas. He says peas are from Greenland. I recommend this book with 5 stars because I like the characters.
B0037KMHRY|3.0|Daft Punk is thanking Hans Zimmer, The Maestro, at the end of the CD sleeve. It's no wonder. The sound of this soundtrack is pure \\"Remote Control / Media venture\\" style, the famous school Hans Zimmer created in order to produce clones of him. I tell ya, is there a musician in the film scoring industry who has helped change his field (for better or worse?)as much as Hans Zimmer?     Since he scored \\"Crimson Tide\\" in 1995, almost everybody is trying to re-create that \\"Roll Tide\\" sound. We now have a \\"Zimmer effect\\" or a \\"Zimmer touch\\" out there. \\"Zimmerian\\" is now a new adjective in the industry, like \\"This is a Zimmerian score\\".     \\"Tron Legacy\\", the soundtrack, is of course a guilty pleasure. Each track has a little thing going for it. You put on the CD in your player and you can either relax to it and travel to another time and place or you can just do something else and have it as background music to which you'll catch yourself whistling all the time.     The sound is very close to the one heard in \\"The Dark Knight\\", \\"Batman Begins\\", \\"Transformers\\" and \\"The Terminator\\". I don't know to which degree the Grand Master Zimmer helped but you'll have no problem putting some tracks of this score on a personal \\"Remote Control / Media venture\\" compilation, along with \\"Transformers\\", \\"Iron Man\\", \\"Clash Of The Titans\\", \\"Armageddon\\" and others \\"Pirates Of The Caribbean\\".    I'm not familiar with Daft Punk but it's easy to guess that some of the tracks (#12 and #13, mostly) are of their own creation. But the rest is very \\"Zimmerian\\". If Hans Zimmer didn't help much, well then Daft Punk copied him openly. And like i said, they thanked him at the end...     Anyhow, \\"Tron Legacy\\" is the kind of soundtrack that if you start analysing it, you'll probably end up criticizing it. But if you just put it on and enjoy it, it'll be a guilty pleasure.     \\"The Grid\\" is particularly impressive. The voice of Jeff bridges really is echoing in your car or in your room when it plays.     It'sa good thing Hans Zimmer is my favorite film composer and it's a good thing that i don't mind all the clones he created (Gregson-Williams, Rabin, Badelt, Glennie-Smith, Jablonski, Djawani, Powell... and now Daft Punk?)

B004132I4S|5.0|I have seen this name Sufjan Stevens appearing on year-end best-of lists, but never really took notice other than he's an accomplished folksy rock singer. Well, I decided to find out what the fuss is all about by listening to The Age of Adz. Boy, I was blown off and completely overwhelmed by Stevens. My first thought was was that he kinda sounded like a younger Damien Rice but I could not be more wrong. Sufjan Stevens is a genius and The Age of Adz is possibly the year's must-listen album. The musical styles are varied, his voice impassioned to no end and the songs are impeccably stirring.<br /><br />There's never a dull moment and each composition is layered - a great mix of rock, folk, electronic and pop but none threatens to create disharmony. Instead, it's a pretty delightful amalgamation.  And Steven's lyrics are certainly most insightful and personal. Choice tracks include  Now that I'm Older, I Walk, Futile Devices, Too Much and of course, the 25-minute epic Impossible Soul. No one would imagine sitting through a song of such great length but what Sufjan Stevens has created on Impossible Soul, some artists could never muster in their entire career. The song itself is distinctive and unique, thematically running but wrapped in a myriad of styles and  melodies. While most monster-length compositions suffer from some form of disjoint, Impossible Soul works on all levels. Imagine my joy at the end of each day now is to put Impossible Soul on play and slowly savour it. Now, I call it The Age of Great! Still, it is sad that Sufjan Stevens remain so incredibly underrated but then again, it could be a blessing and if he continues to be able to put out such great music, there's no short of ardent fans and supporters.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|I've taken a crap more interesting than this. The best part of it was the nude scene of Violante Placido, and that wasn't worth the money. Whatever he got paid for this wasn't enough to put his name on it let alone be in it. Sometimes even big name stars can't carry a movie, and this one is a back breaker. I'm not saying don't watch it, just don't buy it if you don't have to, cause even at the used prices it's not worth it. They should have taken the money it cost to make this movie and flushed it down the drain. I've seen a lot of boring movies, but I can't remember any being this slow and boring. You find yourself wondering who's going to get shot, so you can shoot them yourself just to get this thing over with. I've seen documentaries faster than this, and I'm not much on watching documentaries cause there usually slow, but I finished watching this and I can't remember why, what I do know is that I didn't get my monies worth. ONE STAR FOR NUDITY, mostly because I had to.
B0021L8V0W|4.0|I originally saw this movie last summer (2010) when it first came to theaters.  I went in expecting nothing more than a run of the mill movie and I was thoroughly entertained by the plot and the performances.  Angelina Jolie is dynamite in this.  There are different cuts and engings here.  My personal favorite is the theatrical release version as the others felt a bit too contrived.  If you liked Point of No Rturn, La Femme Nikita, and The Long Kiss Goodnight, you'll most likely enjoy Salt as well.
0812973992|5.0|Let The Great World Spin was a book club selection, which was enjoyed by all who attended, and it prompted a lively, intelligent discussion. The story is based on the lives of eleven characters on the day in 1974 when French funambulist, Philippe Petit, danced across a wire (tightrope) secured between the new twin towers at the World Trade Center in New York. It is a well-written, literary masterpiece with highly believable, three-dimensional (complicated) characters.<br /><br />The characters are extremely diverse, and include an Irish immigrant \\"monk\\" with a heart of gold, a Park Avenue wife of a judge/mother of a son who was killed in Vietnam, a Guatemalan nurse to a young artist trying to kick a cocaine habit and living a 1920s lifestyle, a heroin-addicted streetwalking prostitute and her daughter and two young children. There is also a chapter where seemingly unrelated characters in Palo Alto, CA--a group of pioneering computer hackers--find a way to contact payphones in Manhattan on the day of Petit's performance, and try to get a live blow-by-blow account of the event from eye-witnesses. It's a reminder to the reader of the state of technology at the time, and how different the world of 1974 was from today, when the event, no doubt, would have been broadcast on every television station and the Internet.<br /><br />This prompted our group to discuss our own \\"day-in-the-life\\" experiences we had on Sept. 11, when we first heard of the attacks on the twin towers. Not surprisingly, everyone in the room watched the horrendous events unfold on television.<br /><br />The high wire event loosely connects all the characters and it feels as though the lives are spinning and folding atop one another in unexpected ways. In spite of the darkness and at times, overwhelming grief associated with these character's lives, the reader is left satisfied and reminded how different (and important) each life and each character's personal story is.<br /><br />I give this book my highest recommendation.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens is the author of [[ASIN:193217236X Irish Twins]].ozzens is the author of [[ASIN:193217236X Irish Twins]].
B002K0WBXW|5.0|The Proposal is a film that needn't be dissected nor analyzed to be enjoyed. It is just plain fun for adults. The casting is perfect and Ryan Reynolds displays his comic skills beautifully. He is able to establish his strengths while matching a very talented Sandra Bullock scene for scene.  There is a lot of cast talent and great timing here. The occasional nudity is  very conservative so most viewers should feel comfortable. Let yourself sit back and just enjoy a good time. I promise, you will laugh out loud.

B004BSIJ9Q|4.0|Kanye West is nowhere near is as talented, innovative, or original as he and his adherents believe, and the themes he explores on this album (decadence, excess, existential despair and individual moral degradation) have been explored countless times in all forms of art for centuries.<br /><br />But I cannot help but admit that I find this the most ambitious, interesting, and coherent album a hip hop or pop artist has produced in ages. One of the chief criticisms that anti-hip-hop critics and fans commonly make, is that its not \\"music\\". This is music, with a diverse and eerie set of samples painstakingly woven into something that approaches an apocalyptic symphony, one not so easy to turn away from.
B002ZG9774|5.0|After reading the review by Robert Horton I wondered if he had actually seen this movie.  I loved Burlesque the first time and loved it the second time and am waiting for the DVD to be released.  It is totally entertaining and at times I almost applauded after some of the dance numbers.  Cher does a stand up job in her role but if you don't like Cher go see this movie for Christina Aguilara....she blew me away with her talent. It is a feel good movie that will leave you wanting the soundtrack.
B0013527I4|5.0|Does anyone know why seasons 4 and 5 haven't been released?  Are they on hold?  I hope they weren't given the ax!
B004132HZS|5.0|Okay, I just got this in and have not watched it yet so I cannot tell you how \\"good\\" the show is. What I can tell you is that there are only three episodes in season one. I thought there would be a few more episodes in a \\"season\\"    ***updated*** so there are three 90 min shows on this and they are excellent. A wonderful updated retelling of the stories and I highly reccomend them...Though I am still American enought to want a few more episodes. LOL  Ive upgraded my review from a three to a five due to quality.
B000SKNIWE|5.0|Even though it is not full HD 1080p resolution, it is still fascinating film footage, do not let this turn you away from getting this series, there is nothing better out there now to compete with the footage and quality.  This was a series put together by Discovery, BBC and NHK, a Japanese film company; taking 3 major film companies to put together such a amazing documentary.  The narration is great, and the 5 discs cover a broad spectrum of areas.  This is one of the best documentary that help to show nature during our life-time.
