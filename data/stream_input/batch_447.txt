B0001Z52RU|4.0|In Frank Capra's 1946 classic \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\", George Bailey is given a chance to see what the world would have been like had he never been born.  \\"Each life touches so many others ...\\" Clarence the Angel tells George, who proceeds to glimpse a nightmarish alternate universe in which his loved ones would have been miserable without him.<br /><br />\\"The Butterfly Effect\\" is a sort of darker twist on Capra's fable.  In this film, Ashton Kutcher's world is a nightmare from the get-go, and through a plot device that is no less fantastic than a visitation by his guardian angel, Kutcher is given the chance to go back and modify his life to achieve a different result ... time after time after time.  The only problem is, things keep getting worse instead of better as each alternate universe unfolds, until Kutcher finally perceives the big picture and uncovers the key that will truly affect a significant change in the lives of the people he loves.  Suffice it to say that no bells ring at the end of *this* movie to signify that an angel has received its wings; no, this movie ends on a more disturbing - but equally provocative - moral note.<br /><br />The entire cast of \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" is astonishingly good as they go about playing wildly different variations on their characters, with Kutcher giving a particularly strong performance in the leading role.  The cinematography, special visual effects and makeup effects also deserve special kudos.  Not for all tastes, but undeniably fascinating and well worth a look.

0763611883|5.0|When Charlie's little sister Lola refuses to eat, he invents imaginative scenarios to persuade her to eat foods she'd rather not. Carrots become orange twigs from Jupiter and mashed potatoes become cloud fluff from the pointiest peak of Mount Fuji in this precocious romp through dinner time with a finicky eater. The text builds on a patterned list of foods that Lola won't eat until Charlie counteracts each item and Lola herself gets into the act. Child's vivid collage illustrations layer colored pencil people over wallpaper, tile, wood, textiles, photographs, and simple sketches to create scenes as silly and precocious as the characters themselves. Excellent for use in food-based story times or classroom activities. A delight for picky eaters of all ages! Ages 4-8.
B000002MFN|5.0|This album is highly overlooked. This album was very overshadowed by the Sex Book and video to Erotica, but there is more this album than sex. Madonnna was rebelling and started to explore sexualty, lust and androgny. All this songs on this song are exceptionally wonderful. <br /> <br />1. Erotica: The infamous song that started a revolution. This song is very kinky and has a samlping of Kool and the Gang's \\"Jungle Boggie\\". Despite it's sexual nature this song is still hot and deserved more success. <br /> <br />2. Fever: A Very nice cover of Peggy Lee's classic. Madonna gives the song a whole new sound, that's only Madonna. But the version Madonna used in the Video to the song is by far superior to this one. You can find the video version on the German Single of Rain. <br /> <br />3. Bye Bye Baby: A song that kinda doesn't fit in on this album. I don't think it fits in anywhere, but it still good. Madonna is rekindling her high pitched voice in this song.  <br /> <br />4. Deeper and Deeper: A wonderful song. This song was a gay pride song, that rocked. Madonna wanted to revist the disco years in this song. She even throws in a line from Vogue, for good measure. <br /> <br />5. Where Life Begins: Proably the most sexual song on the album. Madonna is wonderful with metaphors and this song prooves it. She compared \\"Dinning In, Eating Out\\" to something more than a fresh cooked meal at dinner time, if you know what I mean. The beat to this song is wonderful it is kinky, but sensual and intimate. <br /> <br />6. Bad Girl: This is one of My favorite songs on the album. I adore this song, the music the lyrics. They are gorgeous. Madonna is talking about a Girl, who is quite provacative and tends to make money off sex and gets drunk every night. She really portrays, that Bad Girls can have feelings, too, and how they may not always like their lifestyle, it's their's and it's hard to change. <br /> <br />7. Waiting: A hot song, where Andre Betts Hip hop style appears. Madonna is talking about a relationship, in which her guy is not treating her like he used too and how she just can't let go. This is a great song and one of my favs. <br /> <br />8. Thief of Hearts: A great song. I love it!! Madonna now gets a little mad at a \\"cheap treat\\" who'll screw anyone and is trying to screw her man. The best line is where Madonna sings \\"Bitch, you do it, you take it, you screw it, you fake it, undo it, you'll break it.\\" This is one of the best songs on the album. <br /> <br />9. Words: A wonderful song. Madonna here talks about how people degrade you and hurt you with words.  <br /> <br />10. Rain: OMG. What a gorgeous song. This song is so full of love and power. It's horriable, that this song did not make it to GHV2. It well deserved it. The beat and vocals are absolutely mezmorizing.  <br /> <br />11. Why's It So Hard: A very emotional song. Madonna, is discussing today's discrimination and predjisim. She mainly talks about homosexulaity and religion, here. This is a wonderful, powerful song.  <br /> <br />12. In This Life: This song is very emotional, proably the most emotional on the album. Madonna is talking about a friend she had who died at age 23 from aids. She talks about the advice he gave her. This is song will bring tears to your eyes and it really make you think about Aids and other diseases in the world. Madonna really makes a good quote at the end. \\"Some say life's not fair, I say people just don't care\\". <br /> <br />13. Did you Do It? A Remix of Waiting. Here Madonna just sings the chorus of Waiting, whilst Dr. Dre Raps. Basically this song is revealing what Madonna's guy is doing while she is \\"Waiting\\".  <br /> <br />14. Secret Garden: This is most likley the most poetic song, Madonna has ever released. Sex does kinda come to mind when you first hear the title, but as you listen you see more. Madonna is hinting at longing to be mother.  <br /> <br />This ALbum is by far one of the best Madonna has ever released. It was ahead ofit's time in 1992 and is still ahead of it's time in 2004.  <br />
B00005KHEU|5.0|I can't seem to figure out why other reviewers find this album inconsistent ... I can play this album from start to finish all the time and never feel the need to skip tracks. This as pointed out by a good friend of mine, is like a greatest hits album. Other albums during that time (late 70s) that garnered such praise would be Blondie's Parallel Lines and The Cars' debut album. I love those two but they can't hold a candle to ELO's Discovery. Perhaps it's the disco trappings, or the overexposure of ELO by the time of the previous album (Out of the Blue with its 4 hit singles). I for one feel that this album is pure pop and a great fun to listen to.  <br /> <br />Lynne knows how to write a good song and his chord changes have the ability to wrench emotion out of you. He does it brilliantly here in tracks such as Midnight Blue and Confusion. The discofied numbers (Shine A Little Love and Last Train To London) fare surprisingly well and are two of the catchiest songs. The bass line in Last Train to London would surface a couple of years later in Hall & Oates' I Can't Go For That!  <br /> <br />Diary of Horace Wimp is a whimsical but charming Beatlesque number (along the lines of McCartney's Maxwell's Silver Hammer but without the black humour!) while Need Your Love is a superb ballad. Then of course there is the big hit Don't Bring Me Down ... groooose! The other two remaining tracks On The Run and Wishing, although the least catchy of the 9 tracks, are still great to listen to.  <br /> <br />The bonus tracks are interesting but not essential. Besides this remastered copy, I also possess the Gold Mastersound CD which is just a tad better in sound quality (more body) but has poor colour reproduction of the artwork.  <br /> <br />Get this if you are starting your ELO collection. You can then follow it up with Time (more progressive but just as brilliant), Out Of The Blue (their double album - when is it going to get remastered?) and A New World Record (not yet remasteredas well). And if you are a completist, get the ELO DVD of the Out of the Blue Tour (the 'live' recording isn't all that great) but you get to see all the videos of the Discovery album, altho' they are all similarly shot in the studio. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002KVULG|3.0|I was very excited when i saw that this movie was being released again on DVD,  but when i put it in the player i was mortified,  when i saw this movie over the years on TV it was always bright and colourful,  but now the Director has drained the picture of colour,  so it looks almost B&W. <br /> <br />I think Universal should put out the colour version as well,  i can't stand this quality,  totally spoils the movie,  in fact i dont think i can watch it again in this state,  very sad,  why do they do these stupid things,  yes i know the Director wanted to do this when the movie was first made back in 79,  but that was then,  this is now,  just leave it alone next time,  i mean you would'nt take other classic movies and make them B&W or colour,  every time i want something,   it's always the same,  things go wrong,  i mean take soundtracks,  i go out and buy them,  but the bits of music i like have been ommited from the Album,  ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
0805062971|4.0|'Normal' life is sliced apart with great precision.  This book is a rarity in that it will make you think, not about others lives, but your own.  No small achievment.  Even if you do not agree with the 'lessons' taught (and I don't)you will still be forced to face many empty aspects of our lives and how we attempt to fill these spaces.  The ending? I didn't see it coming!  Which is high praise indeed.
B00003CXE7|5.0|[...] I think most people have seen this movie, but if not this has been called many times by many people the best hero movie of all-time. Ridley Scott (BLADE RUNNER, ALIEN) transports Hollywood to second-century Rome in this rousing historical epic that proudly harkens back to such films as BEN-HUR and SPARTACUS. Russell Crowe plays Maximus, a Roman general who leads the troops in conquering Germania for the empire. When an aging Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) tells Maximus that he'd like him to rule Rome once he's gone, a classic confrontation ensues between the brave and charming soldier--who wants to return home to his wife, son, and farm--and the jealous and conniving Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the emperor's only son, who is thirsty for power. Bought as a slave by the profiteering Proximo (Oliver Reed, in his last role), Maximus must kill or be killed in the ring, battling to save not only himself but the future of the very empire that he loves and honors. The film features a terrific battle sequence (that recalls the beginning of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN), huge crowd scenes of thousands of people, and even a little romance, albeit mostly taboo. The impeccably choreographed gladiator scenes are violent yet thrilling, flashing by like lightning. GLADIATOR is a glorious spectacle filled with heart and soul.
0140177396|5.0|The book went at a very good pace it didn't seem to fast or too slow, and the book kept me on my feet the whole time. The story made me want to keep reading. The characters in the story made the story fun, and gave it some humor, and they also gave the story a lot of adventure

B00005V3Z4|5.0|I had never heard of DONNIE DARKO before, and got it only because I clicked on several recommended lists by the hardy amazon compilers, and then liked the reviews I read.  <br />At first, I did not know what to make of this film. The opening scene with Donnie awakening from sleep in the middle of an asphalt road on a misty mountain side, was beautiful, but confusing. Although his bike was lying on the side of the road, when he jumped upon it and began pedaling back home, I figured that he had not been in an accident ... so, was he a sleep walker? And, a bit later on, came the infuriating scene where he called his mom a \\"bitch.\\" <br />Naturally my motherly porcupine hackles rose and I prepared myself to hate this film and write a scathing review. <br /> <br />And I will write a review (in my part of the world it's almost midnight now, the bewitching hour), but tomorrow.  <br /> <br />For now, briefly: this is a good film. Intelligent, intuitive, creative. The teenage Donnie Darko (despite calling his mom a bitch, and of course he deserves a sound trashing for that, especially because his mom as well as his dad are good people) is a likeable character, and soon you find out that he does appreciate his parents, his sisters, even his small picturesque American town. However, he is tormented by hallucinations and is taken medication and undergoing therapy. The way I interpret it, Donnie is deeply sensitive, and a genius as well as a psychic. Yes, he's got too much brains, too much heart, and can see into the future as well. The six foot tall monstrous bunny is his sixth sense which he of course does not recognize as such, and I'll bet many of you will disagree with me. That's OK, though, DONNIE DARKO invites you to make your own assumptions and interpretations. <br /> <br />If you want to think, watch this movie. But do watch it sober, no booze or what-nots please during viewing! Its effect is psychedelic enough, and you don't want to miss the nuances. <br /> <br />I certainly liked the ending. Though completely unrelated, it reminded me of AMERICAN BEAUTY and Kevin Spacey. And of course there is always the possibility that if we want it strongly enough... we might turn back time to right wrongs... and give our loves ones a second chance ... even if it means to sacrifice ourselves.... <br /> <br />Parents, this is a good film you could watch with your teens. Cheers!
B0002KVUKM|4.0|I'm not going to go through the plot of Van Helsing since it is already recounted here many times and you can just look at the back cover of the DVD, just in case. <br /> <br />Those who grew up watching and reading comic books, sci-fi films, cartoons and anime will surely have a grand time playing spot the influences. From his looks drawn from the anime Vampire Hunter D to his Q-like assistant and of course, the Hammer horror films. If you're the type looking for philosophical issues in this film, you'll be in a hell of a disappointment. The only thing that stops me from giving this a perfect \\"fanboy\\" score is that the film tends to get a little busy. It's as if Stephen Sommers wanted to stuff all his influences in one movie, it's as if he's afraid that there won't be any sequels. <br /> <br />Buy this film, you'll be rewarded with interesting features that will help you immerse yourself in Van Helsing's world. And similar to Chronicles of Riddick (another fanboy flick), the mythos of Van Helsing wouldn't be complete without the animated prequel where Van Helsing is looking for Mr. Hyde.  Get it if you're a fan of superheroes and such. If not, you simply won't get it.
B000067J1H|3.0|I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW NOT SO MUCH TO RATE THIS MOVIE THAT FOR IT'S ENTERTAINMENT VALUE I JUST GIVE IT 3 STARS BUT, BECAUSE I AM CONFUSED ABOUT SOMETHING IN THE MOVIE AND NO ONE HAS EVEN SEEING WHAT I THOUGHT I SAW IN THIS MOVIE:  <br />I SAW A CRAZY MAN WHO IMAGINED ALL THOSE FIGHTS. THERE WAS NO FIGHTS OR CLUBS OR OTHER PEOPLE TO FIGHT WITH. IT WAS ALL IN HIS MIND. AM I RIGHT? PLEASE COMMENT.
B0002SROSQ|5.0|This double dose should appease both fans of LET LOVE IN & THE BOATMAN'S CALL. What was hinted at in the mildly disappointing NOCTURAMA reaches full fruition here.<br /><br />In short,you have the more upbeat ABATTOIR & it's somewhat more mournful brother, LYRE.<br /><br />ABATTOIR kicks off with the sonic assault of \\"Get Ready For Love\\". A twisted revival meeting, featuring a wild eyed hoarde of backup singers who come off more like The Tipsy Bacchanal Choir than the London Community.<br /><br />Those still mourning Blixa Bargeld's departure are in for a surprise with Mick Harvey's viscious guitar work. The man plays like he's been chained up for the last 10 years.<br /><br />On \\"Hide Away\\" you can actually hear Cave crack up his backing singers. Which only cements my longtime suspicion that Cave has always had more of a sense of humor than his fans.<br /><br />Despite, beautifully mournful numbers like \\"Messiah Ward\\", Cave's Muse couldn't help but be flattered by the likes of \\"There Shes Goes\\" & \\"Nature Boy\\". Both are gushing odes, swinging from self-doubt to devotional awe.<br /><br />I rolled my eyes when I saw the 2nd half was called, \\"Lyre Of Orpheus\\". But don't expect some middle aged dribbling about the Greek Myth. This thing sounds like something off MURDER BALLADS. A hilarious satire on the creative process. Orph builds a lyre, one pluck & it kills his wife, has \\"birdies detonating in the sky\\" & \\"bunnies dashing their brains out on the trees\\". When he finally ends up in Hell, he's greeted by the bloody aparition of his bride who welcomes him with, \\"if you play that fu#!g thing down here I'll stick it up your oriface\\".<br /><br />The laughs keep coming with \\"Breathless\\". Only Warren Ellis could make a flute sound so demented. The dreamy, \\"Babe, You Turn Me On\\" continues in this vein with sentiments like, \\"one hand round your heart & the other down your panties\\".<br /><br />Everything comes to a fore with \\"O Children\\", it's Gospel choir soaring over Cave's charnal imagry. Throughout it all, The Bad Seeds prove they're one of the best bands around. Blasting it out when necessary or bringing it all down to a whisper.<br /><br />Perhaps the whole attitude behind this double set could be summed up with, \\"you leapt into the abyss & find it only comes up to your knees\\". No self-respecting fan should be disappointed with such a generous offering.ey're one of the best bands around. Blasting it out when necessary or bringing it all down to a whisper.

B00006SFBD|5.0|Wow, I'll have to check them out.  This album has barely left my stereo once I bought it, and with good reason.  I am amazed to hear this much variation on a metal album with only six tracks...the only band to ever hold my attention like that was Black Sabbath with their five-track debut.  These guys, however, have as much variation as Pink Floyd, and truly experiment with their music (which is rare these days...most metal bands follow the trends that were set up in the 70s and 80s). <br /> <br />Deliverance is probably my favorite track on the album, but every track is awesome in its own right.  I really enjoy the balance between the growls and singing on Deliverance.  Rather than clashing on the album, the two seem to flow together.  Melodic growling...who would've thought it was possible?  Opeth proves that it is on Deliverance.  This is metal that any music fan can enjoy.
6305095442|5.0|I love this movie so much that I built a chainsaw arm and I'm going as Ash for Halloween!  This movie is completely ridiculous in a totally aswome way!  Basically these two couples are going to this spooky house in the woods where the find the Necromincon(i.e.book of the dead)and invoke powerful evil demons!  The zombies/demons kill everyone except he is most worthy....Ash!  But his hand gets possessed so he HACKS IT OFF!  How could that senario get cooler....lets see....BUILD A CHAINSAW ARM!! OH SWEET JESUS YES! So he gets a shotgun and with his boomstick and chainsaw he renders justice to the dead.  Then a big demon comes and casts him and his ride into an alternate fantasy world.  He renders justice to the dead there as well...but that's another movie.  BUY THIS AND LOVE IT!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is a \\"must have\\" for all of us who grew up listening to the Beatles and who liked George best.  I had the sensation of being with a group of old friends to celebrate the life of another old friend.  I didn't recognize all of the names and the faces; from time to time I would think \\"who is that guy?  He sounds so familiar\\".  But whether I knew the performer or not, the music was familiar and done the way George did it.  No one was trying to re-invent the music and I appreciated that.  The high points for me were \\"While my guitar gently weeps\\" with Paul, Ringo and Eric Clapton and Billy Preston doing \\"My Sweet Lord\\". By the time those 2 songs were finished, I had tears running down my cheeks.  Where did all the years go?  Seeing George's son Dhani was like looking at George through a time warp.  I think it was Eric Clapton who said that it was like George stayed young and the rest of them got old.   <br />If you loved \\"The Concert for Bangledesh\\", \\"Abbey Road\\", \\"All Things Must Pass\\", The Traveling Wilberrys or anything else that George was involved in, you will want to own this DVD.  It will make you sad and it will make you smile and it will make you grateful that George graced us all with his music.
068987474X|2.0|The last place you should go for advice on men would be the creators of the feminized primetime soap-opera \\"Sex in the City.\\" It's an overly dramatized female-perspective show with little honest insight into male psychology. <br /> <br />As a man, allow me to let you in on the more substantial reason why many good men \\"refuse to commit and/or progress\\": because we've seen dozens of our male colleagues thrown into fits of depression by the matrimonial law system. <br /> <br />If you think men should be more comfortable making committments, then help legally transform marriage so that women & men are protected equally. This means a rebuttable presumption of shared custody and more widely available male-oriented relationship counseling and social services.  <br /> <br />The reviewer notes that the book states, \\"[The book] knows you're a beautiful, smart, funny woman who deserves better.\\" If that sounds like you; well, there's another reason why a guy would not commit -- you're always right, and you always think you deserve better. <br /> <br />If you want crumby advice, watch soap operas, and seek advice only from those men who will give you the answers that you want to hear (your \\"sensitive\\" male therapist or your gay buddy).  <br /> <br />If you want good advice, find an everyday red-blooded male, sit him down, and start the conversation as follows: \\"I was talking the other night with a few of my girlfriends. They told me that they wished their men would be more open about their emotions. One of my friends piped up and defended her man, saying that there was little point in a guy expressing his emotions, so long as we women are telling them what their emotions are supposed to be. What do you think of that?\\" <br /> <br />See what flows from that conversation. I assure you, the guy will be stunned. It may even take him a while to think about what his emotions really are in that circumstance. Eventually, I think you'll be suprised. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002SROT0|4.0|An extremely dense album in all senses. Often lacking the musical lightness of the past three albums, it is however a very consistent work unlike say Figure 8 which fluctuates between whimsy and the direst moods. How much of this impression is based on the lyrical content and how much due to the production which is in itself quite raw, is still unclear to me as I work my way through this opus dedicated it seems to self deprication. Elliot clearly wasn't happy with himself during this period - not to imply there is a happy Elliot Smith album -  but more than ever he seems to be consigned to defeat and prepared for the end. I can't help but wonder how different the end result would have been had Elliot had more input into the final mix. Some of his trademark vocal overdubs are missing, but they perhaps aren't really needed here. Maybe this is exactly the record he had in mind. This isn't a pretty album, but if it's as good as his others, it will continue to unfold for many years to come and we may know more about this songwriting genius than we did before.
068987474X|5.0|I loved this book! <br />Not b/c the writing was stellar, though it wasn't bad but because it gives me power. Yep. It woke me up, shook me hard and made me realize that if someone isn't in to you you can move on not wondering WHY he did anything.--- <br />Bottom line. You quit asking why, making excuses and befuddling yourself with possible scenarios (ie \\"What did I say?, Was my skirt too slutty? Does he not like cats?\\") and get over it and then on with your life. <br />It is empowering when you take the pressure off. And let me tell you - a few other reviews I have read are concerned that the book does not address the issue of some men being unable to communicate or show his feelings. That isn't it. He just wasn't interested. Plain and simple. Men will jump through hoops and walk on hot coals to impress a woman they like and then they will continue to do this b/c the LIKE her. Maybe some men will never show their feelings to ANY woman b/c maybe they just aren't interested in dating, but then that is NOT the kind of man you need to even pay attention to. <br />Read it and grow.
0262731541|5.0|Every ten years or so, I'll come across a nonfiction book that is not only highly informative and well written, but presented in an enjoyable manner.  Bicycling Science, 3rd edition, is that book for this decade.  I originally purchased the book for the physics, specifically the stability discussions, but I absolutely love the physiology section where it seems that a well rounded and up to date review of the research literature has been included.  It has truly made me a better cyclist.  Thanks to the authors for writing the book and taking the time to update it 20 years after the previous edition.

Comparing Green Day to some homo's much less, comparing a 14 yo group to a bunch of recent losers.  Much less this is a punk band ya douche.  I've always been a fan of punk, and many bands down the road have let me down.  Sence Dookie, Green Day just wasn't the same either at least in my opinion.  Here and there, were glimpses of brilliance but it seemed long gone.  Who has ever heard of a band making 8 albums and then suddenly releasing their best one ever.  American Idiot is a punk classic, it'll go down in music history.  Buy the damn CD.  From beginning to end just let it play.  Like so many others, my faith is restored.  These guy's are all at least in their late 20's and early 30's still making Punk.  And as far as i'm concerned they never sold out, and tried something too different.  These days it's f'ing awe inspiring.  And this is the realest punk music u'll ever get.  I won't bash all those bands I really hate for claiming they're punk and really aren't but I will bash Good Charlotte and I don't care who knows.  They are the worst sell outs out there are.  Green Day forever.
B00005K3O4|4.0|A film capitalizing on Coulrophobia, in which a troupe of interstellar clowns descend upon earth within a craft in the shape of a big-top tent, and proceed to encase the resident humans in a small township inside jacaranda cocoons, for future meals. Yes, these clowns are here to consume the vital fluids of earthlings, yet there is no presence of a \\"cook book\\" entitled \\"How To Serve Man\\", although this presentation may have been partly inspired by that Twilight Zone episode. The only ones privvy to their intentions are \\"Debbie and Mike\\", a couple who had witnissed their ghoulish propensities, and go forth to stop them at all costs, yet no-one believes their seemingly wild tale, especially the Police - yet eventually, a deputy joins them in their quest to vanquish the gluttonous bafoons who exhibit all of the characteristics of their trade to the extreme. By utilizing the sheeple's gullibility, they are entranced by their antics, including an impressive hand-shadow display, until captured and preserved, and they do not waste their food.<br /><br />Particularly remarkable and amusing scenes include a small clown being harassed by a gang of bikers, who then proceed to enact some of his own justice by literally \\"knocking his block off\\"; the dispatching of the Police Chief by using the compassionate glamor of his jestery to catch him off guard; four clowns, after emerging from a small car, throwing acid pies at a security guard, reducing him into a globulous pile of ice cream - ulna & radius protruding from the gelatinous mess; a puppet show entertaining a teenager who ends up victim; a blonde attacked in the shower by baby snake-like clownheads, birthed into existence by popcorn seeds.<br /><br />In the end, after gaining the cooperation of a couple of horny brothers who own an ice cream truck, Mike and the deputy engage in the final showdown within the bigtop craft, scurrying through the mazes within, rescuing Debbie who had been previously captured and contained within a balloon, until they face a clown monster. Suffice it to say, the film has an explosive and colorful finale.<br /><br />I did like the appearence of the clowns themselves - with exaggerated features, demonic laughter, and pointed predatory teeth. These characters would make for acceptable Halloween Horror costumes.This is indeed a \\"cult classic\\", and purposeful B+ Movie fare in My estimation.

0688156819|4.0|This little book is great for Burton fans and lovers of the macabre. The pictures are great, and the stories are, as the title suggest, quite meloncholy. Each story is about an unfortunate misfit just trying to get by in life, while the painful norms of an unforgiving society sent them to death or into the shadows. <br />It isn't a masterpiece, however. It isn't quite as funny as it could be and I found some of the poetry a bit trite, but this is still vintage Tim Burton for the page. Recomended for die-hard Burton fans, and for lonely misfits the world over. <br />

B0002VL0KQ|4.0|What can I say???  Celine Dion has one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard.  This is a beautiful cd to put on and to just enjoy!  She has the voice of an angel.  Whatever she sings makes me listen, and this one is no exception.  Wish she was recording more!
B00005JKN9|2.0|Unfortunately, a performance of a lifetime - Daniel Day Lewis as Bill the Butcher - is wasted in this bedazzling, but quite unsatisfying, spectacle.  The costumes and sets look great.  Unfortunately, the film's window dressing is the best part of Gangs of New York.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment of the film was the quite forgettable performances of Cameron Diaz and Leonardo DiCaprio, who unfortunately portray the film's two main characters.  Quite frankly, we find that we still don't give a damn about either of them by the end of the movie.  The second best performance in the movie is that of Liam Neeson, who is unfortunately, killed off in the film's opening segment.<br /><br />Gangs of New York fails as an Epic; indeed, it collapses under its own weight.  It is trying to convey too much with too little (script and story-wise) and comes out a bloody, garbled mess - a sensory overload.  It fails in the end to convey a cohesive message, a unique or inspiring story, or memorable, believable characters as great Epics like Gone with the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago, The Godfather and Dances with Wolves.  Again, Bill the Butcher stands alone as the only character in the film of any depth or complexity.<br /><br />And as always, Scorsese allows his blood-lust and obsession with violence to compromise the quality of the film.  While we can occasionally look past his indulgence when the movies are up to par (Goodfellas, Raging Bull, etc.,) - great lines, sharp screen-writing and direction, memorable scenes and characters - all of those elements are sorely lacking in this film.<br /><br />Indeed, if there is one phrase I could use to describe this movie, it would be \\"over the top.\\"  Gangs of New York was a major disappointment.
B000068IEU|5.0|It was banned in several states.  It was forbidden in many countries.  Now it can be bought at your local Wal-Mart. My have times changed.  This is the masterpiece of the 1970s.  Before the massacre in Texas, before the dead had a dawn, there was 'House.'  Produced on a shoestring budget and based loosely on \\"The Virgin Spring,\\" this chiller set the standard for the revenge flick.  Relentless, uncompromising, and brutal, this film has very little in musical score, and feels so real at times, you feel as if it were news footage unfolding live before your very eyes.  Wes Craven delivers a one, two punch with his direction, seeing things from the victims point of view, and the family who discovers that the people visiting them are not what they say they are, and they figure out the truth.  A must for any serious horror film collector.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|If you want to hear a great, unbridled laugh...get this movie.  It is literally one of the funniest movies.  Tom Hanks nails the concept of comedic timing.  He is so great at expressing annoyance, delerium, anger, jealousy, skeptiscm, and pride.   <br />This movie follows Tom Hanks and girlfriend (Shelly Long) through their tumultuous ordeal of renovating a \\"lemon\\" of a seemingly beautiful mansion.  There is a classic scene where the tub falls through the ceiling onto the 1st floor and that is where the hysteria really starts.  But my favorite scene is when Tom Hanks gets stuck in the floor and starts talking about care bears and farm animals. Classic! <br />Anyhow, you will not go wrong in getting this movie, it is a kick in the pants!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|It's amazing to me how much love Romero's original masterpiece \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" is finally getting.  First, the lavish, fast-paced redux, now this comedy/horror hybrid---A love story...with zombies.  I found myself laughing and laughing  all through this epic.  But wait gore hounds, this IS a zombie movie, complete with original music featured on the \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" soundtrack.  A wonderful tribute movie that stands out on its own.  A must for horror fans, and for those in to Brit humor.  If George Romero and Monty Python made a movie together this would be it!!!!!!
B0002KQNL8|1.0|This is not a zombie movie. When did zombies give up on eating human flesh and go straight for their brains??? When did they start talking? If you want a real zombie movie, look for the Romero Series: Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I bought this album simply to show my financial support for a band that had the guts to write a genuine protest song in this \\"age of paranoia.\\"  What a thrilling surprise to find that the rest of the album (except for the last track) is a genuine PUNK/ROCK Opera!!! <br /> <br />After three complete listenings, I believe that comparisons with Ziggy Stardust, Queen, Husker Du, The Clash and even The Who are not unwarranted or out of place here.  While there are certainly riffs on this album that are \\"influenced\\" almost to the point of plagiarism, show me a great rock band that hasn't ripped off a lot of other great music in one way or another.  This album is a brilliant work of real music by a band that made it big and then, at some point, obviously decided it was time to do something more than snog with groupies in their money bin. <br /> <br />Quite frankly, making this album must have been a lot of hard work.  It took tons of creative song writing, and probably hundreds of hours of practice, arrangement and rearrangement to get this result, and that effort shows from one end of the album to the other.  I didn't think there were any rock bands today who were still this serious about the music; but obviously Green Day is.  I'm going to buy a copy of this for all my friends, and you will probably end up wanting to do the same. <br /> <br />By the way, as much as it hurts to spend the money, BUY a copy of this one - Green Day deserves our support for putting out an album of this caliber.
B0001I562I|5.0|This movie was one of Disney's best movies they have ever made, why no sequal appears to have been made I can't understand why not, maybe if enough people buy the dvd someone will look into making a sequal and realise the potential in this forgotten classic.  Sarah Jessica Parker has abig enough income, and im sure it was this movie that probably made her so popular, I think it's about time she gave something back to the community and made a sequal for this movie.  I for one would definatley buy the sequal and any sequals made.  I have heard from several people that they claim to have seen a sequal, but with years of searching I have not been able to confirm a sequal made, if anyone is aware of a sequal please email me on wfn@xtra.co.nz.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I thought that Troy was fantastic! If you're looking for 100% historical accuracy, this is not necessarily your cup of tea. If you're looking for quality, epic filmmaking, then this is your best bet! <br /> <br />The stellar cast does an excellent job of portraying Wolfgang Petersen's vision of the Great Trojan War. Brian Cox was entertaining as a devilish, sardonic Agamemnon. The part of Prince Hector was impeccably acted by Eric Bana. The great Peter O'Toole flawlessly captured the devotion of King Priam. Orlando Bloom perfectly embodies the passion and intensity of the young lover Paris, Prince of Troy. Sean Bean (familiar to Ringers as Boromir) delivers a well-acted performance as Odysseus, ruler of Ithaca. Brendan Gleeson is great as the furious and jilted Menelaus, King of Sparta. <br /> <br />The central character, however, was Achilles -- superbly portrayed by Brad Pitt. He shows the audience a deeply tormented warrior, gripped in an internal struggle. Pitt impressively exhibits Achilles' legendary prowess during several battle scenes. Pitt also does a good job of showing Achilles' tender side, as evident in the love between Achilles and Briseis (played by Rose Byrne). <br /> <br />Overall, the movie was very enjoyable. It gives the audience a glimpse into ancient past with rich settings and larger-than-life scenery (the famous Trojan Horse was particularly fascinating). This movie has a bit of something for everyone: guys will like the battles, girls will LOVE the costumes (Bana, Bloom and Pitt in the minis). But seriously, this is a great film (a long one, too, but so worth it) and I highly recommend it to all movie-lovers out there. Enjoy!
0385508417|5.0|I read this book two years ago and I loved it!  I knew it would make a good comedic movie and was delighted to see that Tim Allen is starring in it.  Although, it looks like they added things to the movie (not a big surprise), I'm looking forward to seeing all the other similarities.  Definitly read this book!
0679720200|5.0|Camus presents in this small novel a certain view of the world. The indifferent universe creates an indifferent hero. The lack of seeming moral feeling and scruple, the absence of deep emotion in the hero  fit in well with the seeming indifference of both society and cosmos to the hero.<br /><br />This detachment however becomes an expression of its time and a style. It becomes too something others can recognize and admire as a true way of being. It becomes the absurd hero in an indifferent world whose life and action have a kind of detached mystique and beauty.<br /><br />By every sign the one true feeling Camus shows in this work is his admiration for beautiful prose.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Over the years, I have had many favourite films, usually based around either stunning visuals (Blade Runner) or incredible scripts (The Godfather). But the first time I saw American Beauty with my wife, I was instantly in awe of a film that has been my benchmark ever since. <br /> <br />To me, Alan Ball has written the perfect script. Beautifully structured, original, and with characters that are both fantastic and incredibly believable at the same time. The film is about finding beauty in the everyday. The brilliantly realised character of Ricky Fitts is the tool with which Ball gets this concept across to the audience, with his obsession of videotaping the miost mndane of subjects in a belief that they are truly beautiful. But the most beautiful part of the film is the portrayal of Lester Burnham - my new hero. Lester is a very frank and honest portrayal of a man - flaws and all. Ball does not shy away from even those embarrassing fantasies and weaknesses that all men would rather were not discussed or presented to a wider audience, (for example, Lester's sexual obsession with the teenage Angela). What Ball does, is make Lester beautiful for who he is, not what a Hollywood machine would normally have us see him as.As Lester accepts who he truly is, warts and all, he is able to transform into a person at peace with himself. The power in this transformation is tangible and incredible. Probably my favourite moment of the entire film (in a film filled with great moments) is the simple look on Lester's face when he is asked \\"How are you?\\" and his realisation that he is in fact \\"Great. I'm great. Thankyou.\\" <br /> <br />Beyond the incredible script, of course, is the impressive directorial debut of Sam Mendes. Sam makes this film visually stunning to watch. Scenes such as Ricky's description of the floating plastic bag and his video of the event that he believes is beautiful would have failed miserably if Sam had not been able to create such a beautiful moment himself with that bag.  <br /> <br />If you do watch the dvd, please take the time to listen to the commentary track. Mendes and Ball are fantastic and perform probably one of the best commentaries I've heard, both entertaining and informative at the same time. <br /> <br />I have lost count of how many times I have watched this film. Yet it rewards my attention every single time. Beyong the script, it is a beauty to watch. The sondtrack carries you through effortlessly. The photography is extraordinary. The performances unmatchable (watch Chris Cooper too - he is incredible in this). <br /> <br />American Beauty is an experience that everyone should try.
B00005A46T|4.0|Iowa is a pretty damn good album from Slipknot, even though they may be clowns, this riot of 9 clowns have all the know how to make a heavy album. Yes, they are a nu metal band, but in my opinion, they are probably the heaviest in the world of nu metal....People = Sh*t, a fast song with lyrics raging on about how people treated them badly in their life which vocalist Corey Taylor screams or \\"throat talks\\" (not rapping) through the ripping guitars and pounding drums from Joey Jordison, who really shines on this track.  <br /> <br />I have heard of Slipknot for some time but never took the time to buy a CD from these guys, it wasn't long after when I went to the theater to see the movie Resident Evil, where at the ending credits, I then heard the song My Plague, which is another hateful song, Corey shows another side of him, where he actually sings the chourse rather then guts it out. There are many other hard heavy hitting songs on here as well, I do have other favorites on here like The Heretic Anthem, Left Behind, which is another song where you can hear Coreys talent in singing, The Shape, I Am Hated, and New Abortion. <br /> <br />Even though there are 9 members of the band, I simply refuse to go over each and every one of them, my only complaint is however is how simplistic the guitar playing is, the only 4 people that really seem to shine on this album is Joey, Cory, James and Mic...but with 9 members in the band, who needs to be complex, but can be complex as a whole. However, if you want to know the line up for Iowa here it is.....Sid Wilson(Turn Tables) Joey Jordison(Drums) Paul Gray(Bass) Chris Fehn(Precussions) James Root(Guitars) Craig Jones(Samples) Shawn Crahan(Precussions) Mick Thomson(Guitars) and Corey Taylor(Vocals) Whew.....thats alot of members, well this now concludes my review, if you want my advice, if you're looking for something heavy, get this album!!
B0000A1RJI|3.0|I felt this soundtrack was beautifully composed, but horribly rushed. Each song seems to be a mastery of orchestral tactics, yet a blend of undecided themes. It is almost as if only a few select themes were composed, then all were pieced in opposing variations, due to the theme of each scene of the movie. The contrast between good and evil is nicely revealed within this soundtrack, but the bold and brashness of the fight scenes or dark themed songs is almost so great, that most listeners are compelled to flip to a different track. But there are few of these songs, and overall, it's a fair soundtrack. Although; I was dissapointed to learn that the love theme of the movie was only a clip in a couple songs instead of its own track. I would highly advise sampling a few of the complete songs from the CD before purchasing. The vastness of the open sea awaits you in this short, but decently sweet orchestral composition.  <br />Enjoy!
B00005JNEI|2.0|Please, oh please, if you plan to vote on November 2nd primarily on the basis of Michael Moore's arguments, please do some research.  Spinsanity.com and FactCheck.org (both non-partisan) are great places to start (Spinsanity has a couple massive debunkings of Michael Moore, as well as excellent critiques of right-wing sources).  There are plenty of valid criticisms of the Bush administration, but Michael Moore's films and books are not the place to get them. <br /> <br />Just so everyone is clear on who we're discussing:  based on everything I have seen, Michael Moore deeply dislikes the United States, and apparently is a believer that socialism works.  Example:  on his web page a week ago, he made a comment about how he'll be happy when the `means of production are in the hands of the workers', which equates to socialism.  Maybe you think socialism is a good idea.  I have no problem with that--economic justice is a complex, debatable issue; I just want people to understand Moore's background. <br /> <br />All of today's popular pundits (Limbaugh, Hannity, Franken, Garofalo, etc), have a strong ideology, and when it's as extreme as Michael Moore's, it is vital to understand their ideology while listening to their argument.  THEY WILL NOT REPORT WHEN THE FACTS DON'T GO THEIR WAY.  Thus, you will almost never see Michael Moore or Sean Hannity admit when one of their claims is proven false, and they will never competently present both sides of an argument.  Ever.  They sometimes present a straw-man argument for the opposition:  a poorly constructed position built only so they can convincingly tear it to pieces.  This is not the same thing as a reasoned debate. <br /> <br />Worse yet, when pundits try to make a strong point at all costs, as opposed to properly reporting events, they will knowingly and directly twist facts.  This is what John McCain meant when he referred to Moore as `disingenuous' during the republican convention.  One clear example from Fahrenheit:  the Bin Laden family was NOT allowed to leave the country while commercial traffic was grounded.  Moore slips in a key phrase in this sequence:  \\"At least six private jets and nearly two dozen commercial planes carried the Saudis and the bin Ladens out of the U.S. after September 13th. In all, 142 Saudis, including 24 members of the bin Laden family, were allowed to leave the country.\\"  The key phrase is `AFTER SEPTEMBER 13TH.'  Commercial traffic resumed by then.  Thus, his statements are technically accurate, but it is ABSOLUTELY CLEAR that he is trying to sneak that phrase by you in his rapid-fire film and leave you with the feeling that the Bin Ladens left the country before the rest of us could fly anywhere.  See Spinsanity.com or Factcheck.org for lots more information.  Is this a minor point?  Maybe, but put a lot of `minor points' together, and you've got a seemingly powerful argument built on horribly mangled facts. <br /> <br /> Bottom line:  Spin is everywhere.  Information is power.  Be critical of EVERYTHING you read and hear, get the facts, make your own decision.  That's the freedom Michael Moore talks about. <br />
B00005JMAH|4.0|This was one of another films, that I caught over the summer, but didn't get the chance to review, so why not now? This is the first Harry Potter movie since Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, but he is back. And over the summer, in addition to openning in regular movie theatres, it also opened up in IMAX theatres, and I caught on the IMAX theatre at Navy Pier in Chicago. As the movie opens, Aunt Marge (Pam Ferris) has come to the home of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). And when and Marge can't get along, he runs away, and takes a bus ride to Leaky Cauldron Inn, and the Minister of Magic (Robert Hardy) gaves him a warning that Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from jail and his looking from him. And then Harry Potter is reunited with his 2 friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Herimone Granger (Emma Watson) who also is staying at the inn. And back at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledoor (Michael Gambon replacing the late Richard Harris) annouces that until Sirius Black is captured, that Hogwarts will be playing host to ghastly soul-sucking wraiths called Dementors. And once again this year, there is a new denfese the dark arts teacher named Professor Lupin (David Thewlis). If you love the Harry Potter books, or movies, then you might want to watch this, and if you don't like Harry Potter, or can be scared easlity by stuff like this, then don't bother watching this movie.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|One of the greatest films ever committed to screen. Cleverly marketed as a glossy Hollywood massacre of The Iliad, this is in fact a subversive mockery of contemporary Celebrity worship. Why else would Brad Pitt put in such a convincingly hateful performance? He is very thinly disguised as a character called 'Achilles', but at no stage of the film can we forget that this is BRAD PITT. Marlon Bloom, playing himself, also puts in an exquisitely limp performance. <br />  <br />Media illiterate audiences of the past would have lapped up Pitt's ridiculous posturing. \\"Ooooh he's so complex, he's a real warrior, but he doesn't like to see a lady being treated bad\\", viewers of olde would have squealed. Not anymore! A knowing, politically-engaged contemporary audience laughs aloud at the deliberate 2-dimensionality of the appalling po-faced 'hero'.  <br /> <br />This film can't destroy Celebrity worship on its own - but it's made an excellent start. All credit to cast and crew for constructing this bold and groundbreaking slice of cinema.
B0002SROT0|5.0|The first time I heard this album I was very disappointed. Not because i thought it was bad, just because it didn't sound like Elliott at first (i mean coast to coast is completely unlike the rest of his stuff), but this has happened with every one of his albums with me. so i put off writing a review for a week. Now i think this may be his best stuff. Its hard to argue against XO or Figure 8 but i really think this may be Elliott's most complete, creative album (and also easily his most beatle-esque). a look at each track and my grade: <br /> <br />Coast to coast- (C) - The only track on the album i think should have been left off. Its not bad for a hard rock song, but this is just not a style Elliott pulls off too well.  <br /> <br />Lets Get Lost- (A) - This is classic Elliott, obsessive downward progressions (its a lot like white album John Lennon), nice and simple vocals and guitar work. <br /> <br />Pretty(Ugly Before)- (A) - I think this track should have led off the album, its a perfect bridge between the styles from Figure 8 and From a Basement. Great song. <br /> <br />Don't Go Down- (A)- I love this song. Its nice to hear Elliott rock out in a way that maintains his style (which he didn't do so well in coast to coast). Very beatle-esque (guitar work sounds a lot like I Want You (She's So Heavy). <br /> <br />Strung Out Again- (C+ or B+ depending on my mood)- I honestly can't figure this one out. The vocals are painful and i never feel that i like the song while im listening but when the song is done i want to hear it again.  <br /> <br />Fond Farewell- (A+) - This is one of the three best tracks on the album, and among Elliott's best. The lyrics are great and the guitar work is great. Amazingly sad and beautifull song.             <br /> <br />King's Crossing (A Googleplex) - Best song on the album. One of Elliot's best ever. Its like Elliott Smith meets Abbey Road meets For The Benefit of Mr. Kite. And the lyrics are astonishing for the most part, its anincredibly poetic song. <br /> <br />Ostrich and Chirping (F)- Its not a song, its an intro. I'm pretty sure Elliott would not have wanted this as a track (given that he used The Gondola Man and Honky Bach as outros to songs on Figure 8) <br /> <br />Twilight - (A-)- Very nice song. Sad. The solo goes on too long, or this would be a perfect song. <br /> <br />A Passing Feeling- (A-)- Another very John Lennon like song. I like the ending alot, nice guitar work. <br /> <br />Last Hour- (A+)- The last of the really great songs on the album. Very quiet, the song has a very interesting build and the timing is perfect. Great solo too. Reminiscent of his old stuff (from Elliott Smith and Either/Or) but more refined and produced better. <br /> <br />Shooting Star- (C+)- Not a big fan of this one. Its kinda cool, but a little repetitive and way too long, even though the outro is the most interesting part of the song. <br /> <br />Memory Lane- (B+) - It took me a while to come around on this one but i like it. Kinda goofy, until you start listening to the lyrics. Then its good and depressing.  <br /> <br />Little One - (A-)- Background vocals make this one. This is the closest he comes to the style of XO on this album. <br /> <br />A Distorted Reality is A Necessity to be Free- (B)- It's a good song, again very beatle-esque especially in the vocals.  <br /> <br />The first half of this album competes with the brilliance of XO and Figure 8, and i think after a while people will come to realize that this may be Elliott's crowning acheivement, or at least certainly competes with his other albums.
0316666343|5.0|I'm not the type of reader to shove my literary opinions on others - as I realize that art is very specific to each individual that interprets it.  However, this novel is so moving, so tragic, so sweetly hilarious, that I simply had to mention it. <br /> <br />In the first ten pages, I already felt as though Susie Salmon and I had been long lost friends and mourned her (not just because the brutal killing of a child is just too difficult to contemplate, but because she was indeed one of the most loveable characters I have ever had the pleasure to meet). <br /> <br />Three cheers to Alice Sebold...for I hope we will always hear from her.
068987474X|5.0|This book is fabulous.  I know some people who have reviewed it think that it's too simplistic or unexplanatory or not giving the male species a fair shake but I don't believe that to be the case. <br /> <br />The book needs to be simple and unexplanatory because it doesn't have time for the \\"why\\" part.  Why?  Because *you* don't have time for the \\"Why\\" part.  Every single man is different and each man would have a different reason WHY he wasn't into a particular woman; analyzing a catch-all \\"why\\" is pointless.  And you'll probably never get to the crux of some random guy's neuroses anyway especially if you have better things to do with your time-- like find someone who really is into you. <br /> <br />I bought this book a month ago and was able to put its unyielding wisdom to good use after meeting a guy at a party last weekend and have him tell me four days later: \\"Yeah, let's go hang out... but I don't want to lead you on.\\"   <br /> <br />What?   <br /> <br />\\"Well, I'm not very good at relationships... and I'm really busy so I wouldn't have time which isn't fair to you... and I'm totally lame and just not that into you.\\"  (Well, he didn't say the last part-- I added it under my breath.) <br /> <br />How refreshing to get rid of that nonsense having only spent four days dealing with it.  Imagine if I'd hung out with him (when hanging out is not dating) and wasted four *months* on him.  I wouldn't have had any time to find a great guy because I would have been busy worrying about, fretting over, freaking out about and dealing with Mr. \\"Bad At Relationships\\" hoping that he would at least become Mr. Semi-Decent At Relationships.  And I know Greg and Liz would tell me that I deserve way, way better than: \\"Semi-Decent At Relationships.\\" <br /> <br />Greg and Liz are awesome and so very right.  And Greg? I get it!   <br /> <br /> <br />
076790592X|1.0|While this appears to be a great, inspirational book, it's not.  The relationship between Mitch and Morrie is slightly interesting, I suppose.  The whole book, though, is just one big sympathy request.  Apparently Morrie was summoning the spirit of \\"Bartlett's Familiar Quotations.\\"  All of Morrie's lines could theoretically be a quote you add to your picture in the yearbook.  And that's the problem.  It's quote overkill.  The average person doesn't speak in constant inspirational quote mode.  This book didn't change my life, but it did change the position of my eyes (that is, off the pages of this book).  This book is also a desperate attempt to engage sympathy for Morrie.  I'm sorry he has ALS, but I can't do anything to change that (especially since he's now dead).
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Like the novels of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, in quintissential Burton style, Big Fish weaves together elaborate tales of witches, mystical towns, giants, a circus, conjoined twins and much more into a tale of magical realism.<br /><br />The film is based around William Bloom (Billy Crudup)- a frustrated young man who travels with his wife to visit his dying father Edward Bloom(Albert Finney) in order to try and patch up their troubled relationship. The cause of this is William's annoyance (and, one senses, jealousy) at his father's incredible gift for magical storytelling. The pair flashback to relieve fantastical, biographical elements of his father's life as a boy and young man. Ewan Mcgregor plays the young Edward Bloom with a kookiness and idealistic charm although at times he fails to come across with the necessary larger than life charisma that is required of the role.<br /><br />The central message of Big Fish is the posing of the question- is it important to tell the truth, or can beautifully told stories become part of a person's character and life as much as the actual events in their life? This exploration ultimately seems rather shallow in the end. The philosophical and psychological substance of the movie doesn't quite achieve the depths that one senses Burton aspires to.<br /><br />However the film is certainly worth watching- not least for the beautifully crafted cinematography, evocative backgrounds painting a magical, traditional small town American scenes and the subtle, bittersweet score.
6305841861|5.0|I don't throw around the word \\"masterpiece\\" much, nor do I often find myself falling out my chair laughing, but this move is an exception on both accounts.  When this movie was in its theatrical release, I saw fellow theatre patrons literally on the floor laughing --- it was quite remarkable.  This is one of those movies that, when you simply mention it, brings a smile to the face of anyone who has seen it.<br /><br />It may not be for everyone, since the violence contained therein is almost continual and unrelenting and may get to some viewers after awhile.  I can't imagine the cartoon-like gore having much of an adverse effect on any but the most sensitive viewers.<br /><br />From a technical standpoint, especially in this era of CGI special effects, this movie is a wonder to look at.  Rarely will you see camera work like this, along with some of the most insane camera angles ever used.  The editing is masterful and contributes wonderfully to the careening lunacy of the film as a whole.  Most of the acting can be charitably described as adequete (although few of us went to this film expecting performances of a Shakespearian nature), but Bruce Campbell gamely tackles what must have been a tremendously grueling role and gives us pretty convincing performance.<br /><br />This is a hard film to classify.  In the horror genre, a lot of what passes for humor is often simply dialogue laden with really bad puns, and rarely will you find a comedy that contains this level of violence.  \\"Evil Dead II\\" is pretty much in a category by itself.  All you need to know is that it is hugely enjoyable, even with repeated viewings.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie is one gigantic snoozer.  It is not humorous, the characters evoke no emotion and the plot is nonexistent.  So many critics are so willing to sing its praises because they do not want to admit that anything from someone named Coppola could be such a failure as a film.  There are thousands of talented young directors and screenwriters out there trying to sell their skills and this piece of junk gets a big studio release just because the baby from the Godfather directed it.  This is simple injustice.  The Academy and the critics need to put their eyeballs back into their heads and take them out of the nether regions of their bodies.  This movie is not \\"a classic.\\" Nor is it \\"one for the ages.\\"  It is also not \\"visually stunning\\" or \\"revolutionary\\" or even plain \\"good.\\"  It is an example of how a bad movie by a bad director can cheat its way into positive acclaim through family connections and condescending critics.
B00000E2VC|5.0|At first, Michelangeli's Chopin seems linear and technically stupendous.    Upon careful listening, however, it unfolds as something completely spiritual, emotional, and yes, absolutely technically stupendous.    Nobody plays these pieces quite like Michelangeli.  He does not allow himself to pass through these scores fluidly, lightly, but rather uses what is written in the way of basic notes as a means of expressing his own Inner voice.  The results are something of a minor miracle, the perfect union of two distant souls in artistic communion.    The sound is excellent and the performances are immaculate.    Wholeheartedly recommended.
6304936303|5.0|This movie has a near-perfect blend of humor, dialogue, and pure action.  If you watch this movie and only see \\"hatred of women\\" then you should probably step back and pretend you like movies for entertainment value.  Else perhaps you should stop pretending film is a real course of academic study.  This movie is one of the best action films ever.  It surpasses anything Tony Scott has done and rates higher than any of Bruce Willis' recent work.  Further, it is one of the most quotable movies in existence.  So buy the movie, call up a few friends, sit back, relax, have a few beers, and laugh together.  This one is a highly overlooked action-comedy classic.
B000051YD6|5.0|Claudio Arrau was one of those rare musicians who possessed a spiritual and emotional depth so vast, so natural and so spontaneous that he was capable of allowing music as eternal as these Beethoven concertos to speak freely and sincerely through his fingertips.      Here, there is a complete lack of effort or concern, an open and natural absence of shovanistic artistry and interpretation.  One only hears the majesty of Beethoven's music, and feels the security of being led by musicians speaking from the heart.    Sir Colin Davis provides an extraordinarily sympathetic and lustre accompaniment and the sound is as full and as warm as a Caribbean breeze.      I return to these recordings often.  I feel that they are limitless and speak universally, and I would like to take this opportunity to recommend them to everyone.
B00005ASOI|1.0|I could make a movie better than this. <br />This movie is: <br />A) A waste of time and money <br />B) Pure boredom and uninteresting <br />C) For dorks and geeks to watch only <br />D) All of the above <br /> <br />If you chose letter \\"D\\" then you are correct!!!
B0002KVUKW|1.0|I love Huge Jackman but other than his game performance, the movie is just a huge mess from beginning to end. The rest of the acting is horrendous and the story feels like a five-year-old wrote it on the fly. Special Effects don't make a movie and this is a prime example of it and a bad example on top of that. Even the Mummy movies were much better than this and that is because those movies had very good acting and a little thing called a plot. Something Van Helsing does not have.    Avoid, you will thank yourself in the morning.
B00000273P|5.0|I know of no other band which I've turned on to so many other people as Prefab Sprout. We always try to get others to dig what we're digging, and sometimes it works. But whomever I've had listen to either \\"Two Wheels Good\\" or \\"Jordan: The Comeback,\\" they've left blown away. McAloon is one of the premiere songwriters of this generation, hands down. And those years from \\"Two Wheels\\" through \\"Andromeda Heights\\" are the finest in pop music. \\"Jordan: The Comeback\\" never loses its freshness, and I've listened to it dozens upon dozens of times. It's just an incredibly beautiful album. Nothing else like it. <br />You won't know what hit ya.
B0002KVUKW|1.0|Stephen Sommers should hang his head in shame for what he did to this movie. Granted, The Mummy films were fun but that was because of the great chemistry between Rachel Weisz and Brendan Fraser, which made those movies much better than they deserved to be. The only thing in my mind that Stephen Sommers contributed to those films is a heavy dependence on special effects, which is the main focus of this disaster of a movie called Van Helsing. A movie that literally has no plot what so ever. Hugh Jackman is a great charismatic actor and to his credit, he does his best to keep you interested but not even his great talent could save this debacle of moviemaking.  The dialog is horrible and its laughable in a lot of places and the monsters look so fake that you can't keep a strait face while you are looking at them.  I like a good laugh at a movie but this movie is so bad that you really don't need the robots of Mystery Science Theater 3000 to make fun of it. You can do it all by yourself, that's how bad it is.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|This is the best reason to buy a DVD/VCR machine. I have been waiting since July 1985 for this concert to be made avaliable. Thank you Amazon and Live Aid orgaisation for releasing it. Anytime we can seen Dire Straits and Sting jam is well, well worth the price of the DVD. Simply put. Buy it folks. You won't be disappointed.
B0002SROSQ|5.0|Toss in a healthy dose of Leonard Cohen poetics, a touch of David Byrne, and a splash of Rocky Horror Picture Show, and you can envision a Nick Cave afterworld.<br /><br />Nick is a 21st Century Rock and Roll god.  The first album here rocks out a little more but the second one is perhaps even more brilliantly conceived.  Both though, offer up the unique Nick Cave grooves, lyrics, and lush rocking arrangements that make him a true original.  I especially found the piano work as satisfying as anything out there recently.
B00005JNDX|3.0|So many sequels, so little time. Should you spend some of that time with this sequel to the popular and funny Bridget Jones' Diary? If you have a taste for the light and frothy, certainly.  If we were discussing the book, The Edge of Reason, I would say \\"no\\"--- there are far better books, and better sequels, out there. But this is that rare case where the second book was rushed out to capitalize on the wild popularity of the first, and disappointing----- while this movie, not so rushed, is only casually based on and certainly better than the book.     Although neither book nor movie quite live up to the first, fans of the first movie will be well entertained by the second. And I, for one, am immensely glad that at least one horribly painful scene in the book is not even hinted at in the movie: Mr. Darcy keeps most of his dignity intact.    Can you enjoy this movie without seeing the first Diary? Yes, you learn enough of the characters early that this movie can stand on its own. However, I would bet that if you even smile during this one, you will want to rent or buy the first. You'll laugh out loud.    Especially if you love Colin Firth and Hugh Grant, as I do, this sequel is time well spent. I can't spell out why Colin Firth is so attractive, but there it is: he is. He is a much greater presence in this movie than the first--- after all, he (as \\"Mark Darcy\\") and Bridget have a real relationship as the movie opens. Of course they ---uhmm--- \\"mess\\" it up (\\"language, Bridget!\\") with misunderstandings, jealousies, and very funny mishaps. I am not a huge fan of humor based on one character's running the continuum from private embarrassment to public humiliation; yet Bridget, who constantly manages to embarrass herself and others in public, is such a good sport and so charming as Everygirl, that we laugh or groan with her in recognition of those moments in ourselves, and not at her. There are some great laughs in this movie.     Some of them come with Hugh Grant, who seems to have lost the weight that Renee Zellweger gained. Too thin but still devilishly attractive, Hugh's rakish character Daniel Cleaver hangs around to take advantage of the misunderstandings between Bridget and Mark Darcy-- even if he has to \\"hang around\\" Thailand to do it. Cad that he is, when Bridget really becomes a damsel in distress, he evaporates into thin air. That's all right. We know there will be some rough times in between, but surely Mark Darcy, human rights lawyer, will come cantering in on a white horse to save Bridget from Thai prison, right? Not quite. But with a few comic kinks, close enough.     I don't expect Renee Zellweger to receive another Oscar nomination for this one. She is fun, she is appealing, and she is good, but this is not the script for it. I've heard the British objections to her inconsistent, not to say hokey, accent, and while they have some merit here, I do applaud her for bravely diving into Everygirl-dom, a little overweight, a little embarrassed and embarrassing, but with self-awareness enough to make her a cult favorite of all of us \\"Singletons\\". She's effervescent, and she's resilient. Gotta love her.     If the movie was shot on location, it largely lost the advantage of it in Thailand, but that is a mere quibble. A stronger criticism: the first movie's soundtrack was marvelously energetic and witty--- who could forget \\"It's Raining Men\\"? This one, however, tries too hard: too many oldies which are favorites because they are very good songs,  but which have been used in too many soundtracks. Even slightly new arrangements don't imbue them with the freshness the movie deserved. However, the costumer showed some wit in this episode, as well as  underscoring some of the broader humor.      Not serious, not deep, not an exercise for the intellect, \\"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\\" is enjoyable and bubbly, and a darned good time. B--
B0002KVUKM|5.0|This was by far the best movie of 2004. Jackman was born for this role. I'm not going to waste your time repeating what other reviewers have already mentioned. Real horror fans and fans of a good action movie will love this film. The DVD is loaded with fun extras. Just buy this movie, unless you're a boring old fart.
B00005JNDX|3.0|If you read the book Bridget Jones' Diary you might be disappointed by the movie. The book focuses more on her relationships with her friends, who are all wildly amusing and lovable characters. I was disappointed to not see more of those characters adpapted into the screen version.
B00005JMAH|5.0|I loved this particular movie when compared to the series as a whole, but this is not why i'm writing this review. <br /> <br />This review concerns the \\"bonus\\" content for people who pre-order the dvd here on amazon.  The \\"screensaver\\" is not an animated screensaver of the marauders map as you might think, which actually would have been quite nice if it had been done in the style of the map in the movie.  You will be instructed to download a seperate application which will take over your windows screensaver functionality.  The application is not very intuitive to use and I've since deactivated it.  The \\"Marauders Map Screensaver\\" itself is nothing more then 3 random images of indistinct parts of the in-movie Marauder's Map with giant \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" logos that splashed everywhere.  Its not very visually appealing as a screensaver and the images in opinion aren't very well done. <br /> <br />Just want to make sure that other people are aware of what exactly this bonus content is, and aren't buying the dvd here purely because of this.  There is no marauders map style animation occuring here, and all that will be displayed are static images.  I pre-ordered it here purely based on getting this bonus content, and I was rather disapointed with what i received.
B00001NFHU|2.0|Unfortunately I do not share in the enthusiasm of the previous reviewers.  This record is the transition point between the classic Soft Machine and the humdrum new age Soft MAchine of the mid-late seventies.  There are moments of brilliance but to compare this record to  the likes of Third, Fourth or even Fifth is ludicrious at best. this is the beginning of a whole new band and a much different one at that. Without Wyatt and Ratledge taking a distinct backseat the entire feel of the record is \\"safe\\". With all the live issues out (from 69-72)and the the first 5 records also available theres no real reason to purchase this.  My advice: avoid.
B00004Z4WR|2.0|What in concept seems to be a good movie, eventually turns out to be a bad investment. Nicholas Cage is Memphis Raynes, a man renowned all over the region as the best car-jacker ever. Only now, he is retired from his criminal past and has a legitimate garage business. When his sorry-for-a-brother gets involved with a car smuggler who vows to kill him, Memphis must save him by agreeing to jack 50 rare top class cars in a very short span of time. If he fails to deliver all the cars in pristine condition within the stipulated time, his brother would eventually die (I wish he would).  <br /> <br />This premise is enough to describe this total hash of a movie. Memphis gathers his old team of ex-cons and together they set out on this ridiculous journey. I call it ridiculous because the way the movie was made is cheezy and with production values like this, a B-rated movie has greater dignity. At no point in the movie can you relate to the characters in anyway whatsoever. Angelina Jolie is just a bundle of looks, but has absolutely no role in the movie, save for a kiss!. The humour is dry and out of context most of the time as is the timing of some sequences. What bothers me is that in these type of movies, the protagonists never fear for the worst i.e they dont worry somebody might die and they show a sense of coolness which is misplaced. Robert Duvall as Cage's mentor is a saving grace who manages to bring some shine into an otherwise lacklustre plot. In a movie where all the guys are supposedly cool criminals, the director tries to show sentimental brotherly love b/w two protagonists, but ends up bringing you a good anaesthetic. The rest of the actors need not be mentioned. There aren't any 'actors' except the cop. <br /> <br />The only reason this movie might deserve a 2 star is for its cars. Some are beautiful, but most of the movie is dark in picture, thus casting a gloomy picture  on everything.  The scene where Cage 'talks' to a car is rather funny. (Funny as in, crazy !). Dominic Sena, who gave us Swordfish, was probably in a bad mood when he created this one. Only the last car chase is pretty memorable, if not for the car, which Sena did not create !. <br /> <br />Overall, avoid it if you can. It is not the same as the cult classic of the same name that was released in 1974. If you really want to see a good car chase movie that is both authentic and jaw-dropping, watch Ronin or Vanishing Point. Both are uber classics any enthusiast shouldn't miss. Only if you are out of options and dont have anything else to watch, then watch Gone in 60 Seconds......for just 60 sceonds!.
B00005OCMR|4.0|Hollywood has come a long way since Tron was released, so do not expect state of the art special effects here.  Nonetheless, we watch very few films for the effects, and the story and acting in Tron are excellent. <br /> <br />I'm a big fan of David Warner, and while he is better as someone who is of uncertain sanity (as he was in the Hornblower series, or Time After Time) he is quite good as the bad guy, both in reality and inside the computer world.   Jeff Bridges is excellent as the happy-go-lucky geek who is sucked into the computer.  I think the best bit player (and comic relief) in the film is the \\"bit\\", a sprite that can only say \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\". <br /> <br />The best part of Tron for many of us is that it brings us back to the 80s when computers and video games were new.  In that respect, the graphics aren't \\"not bad\\", they're perfect.  This is especially true for those of us who played the Tron video game. <br /> <br />The message aspects of the film aren't as subtle as I might like, and may annoy some viewers.  The biggest trouble with the film is that Hollywood special effects have advanced so far by now that younger viewers (for whom recent films are the FX standard) might see the effects as comparable to Clutch Cargo, and never look past them.   <br /> <br />The Bonus Features are better than many similar products, including an all new documentary. <br /> <br />The story is interesting, and the acting is quite good. Tron is great fun for those of us who remember it, and still a good time for the rest of the audience. <br /> <br />End of Line
1400032717|4.0|I have read some of the reviews readers have submitted on this book, and agree that autism is a tragic condition, probably not one accuratly portrayed in this story.  It must be extremely difficult to live with a child suffering from it, so I mean no disrespect to them by submitting my review. <br /> <br />The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is, in my view, a suprisingly refreshing book.  The point of view of the main character, an autistic child, is innocent and pure, and I was pleasantly impressed by the fact that he was so non-judgemental of the series of very wrong situations he faces during the length of the story.  Some may say he is oblivious or uncaring, but I disagree - in his own unique way he is a caring child, capable of feeling as much affection as his condition allows for both his parents and his pet rat, and for a situation he did not have to participate in, namely the \\"detective\\" role in finding the dog's killer. <br /> <br />How the author tackled Christopher's father's attempts at reconciliation, how he portrayed the man's love for his child as something above and beyond normal duty touched me deeply.  I would have loved the mother to feel the same way, but alas, there had to be some reality to the story, and who am I to judge? <br /> <br />The stress Christopher's autism placed in the parent's relationship as a couple was very well depicted, and it was touching to see how they reacted to it, how they seeked solace in all the wrong places, more as a product of despair than of hatred or vengeance. <br /> <br />I would have changed some unnecessary crassess, but understand that it was intended to portray a very specific social background, but I recommend this book to anyone that wants to really \\"feel\\".  It touches the heart, pure and simple.  I loved it. <br />
0671027344|5.0|This book may be very simple to read, but the lessons that it teaches about life and growing up are very sophisticated. One of my favorite books of all time.
B000000OTU|4.0|Um, is anyone else confused here? People talk about the \\"new\\" Aerosmith as being a ballad band and glossy, shiny pop. I've listened... and listened.... and listened. What I hear is the gritty hard rock band of the 70s with a *somewhat* greater emphasis on ballads, and on some songs a *somewhat* more polished feel. Some seem to find this reason to damn Aerosmith to everlasting hell. I don't. But to my ears I cna't honestly say that the \\"old\\" and \\"new\\" Aersomtih are really all that different. I bought Permamant Vacation when it first came put in 1987 and I never thought it was  that different from their 70s material. Haven't Aerosmith always done ballads? And isn't Uncle Salty kind of \\"poppy\\"?(Who cares, the song's great anyway!)If anyone else is confused about the supposed existence of the evil \\"teenybopper\\" Doppelganger of the new Aerosmith, please click \\"yes\\" below. I personally like all Aerosmith phases. And this time at least, I like the Amazon review!
B000002OMN|5.0|This is hardcore rock, this isn't your typical Ozzy Osbourne release or anything, this is Jim Steinman rock, and that's different but also similar to most rock music. <br />It starts off with this intrumental with some real good electric guitar and some high piano key.<br />two minutes later its all melow sounding and the lead vocal. the song has some great electric guitar through out, and the piano never really leaves which is ok. the lyrics are amazing, <br />the follow up is a more up beat rocker, with jury like backing vocals guitar winding stunts, trust them they're professionals. the rock poetic lyrics and the vocals are a thrill! its definetly double in length but the solo guitars in it are so awesome, i can  care less.<br />next song is the next single, its a great song, MUCH better live, but it is a real nice backbeat in it, don't refuse it =D<br />next track has some real hardcore vocals and some real good melody too it, a personal favourite, some leaps with the music too. <br />the next track is more guitar winding but this time the piano comes through in what the other one didn't, it does repeat the first verse again, but its still great, i don't play it as much as i used too, original is better, imo.<br />next track is another awesome one, with a killer instrumental, with some great songwriting talent, and really good music, it is rock opera, backing vocals and real complex songwriting, i'd love to see this live, it has cars going back n forth through your headphones through out the song, which is perfect for the song's meaning. it also repeats like a few other songs on this cd, but they do it such a hardcore way.<br />this next spoken piece is fun to trip out too, its outrageously funny and serious! amazing imagery this vision gets out, many skip often but i feel it builds up for the next track.<br />this is definetly a heavy song, and a very underrated song. with some hardcore electric guitar and bagpipes in the end, this song is full of mini lines that are really IN  YOUR FACE!<BR>a wasted youth IS better by FAR than a wise, productive OLD age!<BR>(this is a very repeated line, but who cares when its loud, its really good song! another long song (but most songs on here are, Live with it!!)<br />Good Girls has a saxaphone in it, some more harmony and strong vocals, its really good, in fact i wish Meat would do it live and record it!<br />Next track is all synthesizer, its fun too, it shows a lot of conflict between the good and the bad, a MUST listen!! it goes on for two minutes, don't let length worry you here.<br />last track closes like a theatric album or movie should, with a slow song with some nice piano and a closing vocal, the cd started like beginning of an Movie, so it should end like one as well, very well done!<br />------<BR>Voice always, great, writing always awesome, definetly worth the given price, but i would go get it remastered i heard it sounds way better.<br />an Easy 5 stars<br />all songs here would be killer LIVE, but this is the next best thing, BUY IT, come on.
0786915749|5.0|Dragons of Autumn Twilight starts the Dragonlance series and, while it is not perfect, it is a fun easy read for anyone interested in fictionalized accounts from the D&D world. <br /> <br />As a semi-retired D&D player it was a joy to read a saga based on the D&D rules and world.  While it might seem odd for veterans to think of Fireball as a high level, difficult spell, the 'real world' use of D&D rules added to the enjoyment of a fine fantasy story.  The authors make D&D a believable place. <br /> <br />As the editorial review pointed out, there are a few cliches, and here and there the book seems a little weak (some important characters are thrown in late, without enough differentiation to make them easy to keep strait), these faults are easy to overlook since the story is quite good and characters are memorable and interesting. <br /> <br />Parents can rest assured that while there is violence (there is a war on, you know), there are suggestive scenes, and a brutal rape is mentioned (but not described), the book would barely rate PG-13 if it were a film. <br /> <br />It's no wonder this book has spawned something like 100 others - Dragons of Autumn Twilight leaves you wanting to read more of the story of these characters, and this place.
B00003CXCT|5.0|George Lucas has done it again!!! He finally released his pride and joy on dvd on 9/21/04 and it was absolutely worth the wait!!!<br />These are the most important films in the industry today, especially Episode IV, because Hollywood was ready to roll over and die; the film industry was in the toilet. Studios made bad movies just to keep busy (the only good movie up to this point was \\"Logan's Run\\"). When the original \\"Star Wars\\" was released on May 25, 1977, it marked a new beginning for Hollywood.<br />People lined up around the block and waited for hours and sometimes days just to see what the fuss was all about. When they walked out of the theater, they started to dream about the future. One patron, screenwriter Dean Devlin, said after seeing the beginning of  \\"Star Wars\\", knew right then and there what he wanted to do with the rest of his life: write screenplays and scripts for films.<br />Devlin was the of the first of my generation to follow his dream, a dream created by George Lucas, the man who inspired a generation to follows their dreams.<br />Lucas cleaned up these films once again to restore their original luster. He made subtle changes to all of them (visual effects, sound effects, etc.), but most of all he changed a couple key scenes in \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" (the communication scene between Vader and Palpatine) and \\"Return of the Jedi\\" (the insertion of Hayden Christensen as the spirit of Anakin Skywalker). He also tinkered with the Han Solo-Greedo shootout in the cantina again to make it seem like both characters fired at the same time (nice touch, but i still prefer the original shot where Solo kills Greedo in cold blood).<br />All told, this is the FINEST trilogy ever to be released on dvd.<br />5 stars, highly recommended!!!<br />UPDATED, 7/8/05: First off, I want to say this to all the whiners out there: SHUT UP!!!! George Lucas is a pioneer in the movie industry. Without him, nearly all the modern technology that goes into today's films wouldn't exist.<br />Now that I've gotten that off my chest, let's get on with my review. The Star Wars Trilogy is THE BEST thing to hit dvd since The Indiana Jones Trilogy.<br />These are not the same films that most of us grew up with, that's true. The up side of that is we get to see how these films were INTENDED to be seen. George saw an opportunity to improve these films and the one that needed it most was Episode IV: it was incomplete, had primitive special effects (though they were state of the art at the time), and just looked old and dated. George changed all that and finished the film the way it was INTENDED to be seen.<br />My only gripe with Ep. IV is that he added the scene on Yavin 4 between Luke and Biggs, which does add a little continutity to the film, but if you're gonna do it, add the earlier content when Luke goes to Tosche Station to talk to his friends and finds out that Biggs is joining the rebellion. This way, the added scene makes helps with the flow of the film. Other than that, it's an AWESOME film!!!<br />The rest of the trilogy was fine in my eyes, including the insertion of Hayden Christensen as the spirit of Anakin Skywalker. Most folks don't understand it, let alone like it, but it makes perfect sense. Anakin was seduced by the dark side as a young man, so it's only fitting that he join the light side at the point when he was seduced, because there was still good in him and he had redeemed himself.<br />The other surprise was the insertion of Ian McDiarmid as The Emperor in Ep. V. The dialogue was a bit different, but it gives you the viewer, insight as to Vader's true intentions at the time.<br />All in all, these films still get 5 stars from me!!! *****gotten that off my chest, let's get on with my review.

B0002EXH4A|5.0|this update is excellent. there is ,however, one edit in 502 that should have been reviewed before final release. when dave sings 'stopped for a 502' before the fade into the driving sequence, the sound gets chopped abruptly. other than that, awesome CD front to finish. leagues better than the original.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I must toast director Rob Marshall with a tall glass of champagne (I don't even drink, so this should speak volumes to you why I would break my rule!).  He definitely brought a seamlessly successful broadway musical to the \\"big screen\\" with smooth grace.  Though, this process was anything but easy, according to the TV show I distinctively recall on Broadway that divulged all kinds of juicy tidbits about production (particularly the great \\"blood, sweat and tears\\" efforts Richard Gere took in fine tuning his tap dance routine--Gere was previously not known for his dance, partly because he hadn't really formally had to put into practice in a film before.  He went on to showcase his flair for movement in the American remake of SHALL WE DANCE, with Jennifer Lopez.)  Catherine Zeta-Jones had musical theater in her blood, and came by her singing and dancing with ease and grace (and never looked lovelier accepting that well-deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, as Velma Hart in this film, right before she was scheduled to give birth to her baby!).  Renee Zellwegger had minimal \\"formal\\" training in dancing, but made improvements in leaps and bounds (no pun intended), which is made evident in the numbers where she appears as a soloist, as well as her duets with Catherine Zeta-Jones.<br /><br />I know I haven't spent much time discussing the plot, but, in all honesty, it is pretty convoluted and I would only ruin the experience of watching the film for you!  I will say that is set during the age of the \\"Roaring Twenties,\\" and oh boy, did they (rightfully) have something to howl about, back then.  The intrigues associated with fleeting celebrity are examined closely and at their most visceral.  Roxie Hart (Renee Zellwegger) is the \\"up and coming\\" singer/dancer who just can't get that big break, and is never really what anyone is looking for. While Velma Hart (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is the sultry star with the fashionable bob that no one can get enough of.  It isn't until a swift turn of fate (well, that and the sound of a gun going off!) that brings these two women together....in a prison, of all things....Okay, that is where I will stop.  No more plot details required, believe me.  What I will add on to this review, before I close, is just how wonderful the score is by Ebb & Kander.  Songs like \\"All That Jazz\\" are featured here.  You know, those great toe-tapping hits that you frequently associate with some of the greatest works of the late choreographer Bob Fosse (who orchestrated some really hot numbers for the original Broadway production, with his wife Gwen Verdon, who was the original Roxie Hart, along with Chita Rivera, who played a fiery Velma).  There is a reason that CHICAGO received an Academy Award for Best Picture of 2002.  You'll love this film, in all of its saucy and enchanting glory.il a swift turn of fate (well, that and the sound of a gun going off!) that brings these two women together....in a prison, of all things....Okay, that is where I will stop.

You know, those great toe-tapping hits that you frequently associate with some of the greatest works of the late choreographer Bob Fosse (who orchestrated some really hot numbers for the original Broadway production, with his wife Gwen Verdon, who was the original Roxie Hart, along with Chita Rivera, who played a fiery Velma).  There is a reason that CHICAGO received an Academy Award for Best Picture of 2002.  You'll love this film, in all of its saucy and enchanting glory.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|This is the album we've all been waiting for. Sure, you're never going to touch the music they created on 'Rumours' or 'Tusk', so it's useless to compare the two. 'Say You Will' really is nothing short of amazing. We get the catchy pop sounding tracks 'Peacekeeper', 'Thrown Down', 'What's the World Coming To', and the title track. Then we have the Lindsey Buckingham inspired experimental tracks, 'Murrow Turning Over in His Grave', 'Red Rover', and 'Come'. Every track is engaging and fun. Stevie Nicks still proves to have the sexiest voice out there and at times can bring such intensity to songs. What's missing is Christine McVie's sunny pop melodies, but they aren't really missed, given that Stevie has taken that role over and still managed to create luminous images and a certain mystery that only she can do. 'Illume', a track penned by Stevie, about the September 11th attacks is so beautiful. Lots of times when artists write songs about that terrible day, the songs are filled with so many cliches, whereas Stevie creates these lovely, haunting images for us. This album truly is a work of grace and I hope everyone enjoys it as I have.
B000058DFO|5.0|a very nice overview of the beautiful syreeta's career.this beautiful cd has songs from her classic albums such as \\"syreeta\\"(1972)/\\"stevie wonder presents syreeta\\"(1974)/\\"rich love,poor love\\"(with g.c.cameron)(1977)/\\"one to one\\"(1977)/also includes the top five billboard single 'with you i'm born again'(a duet with billy preston)which is from the 1979 original motion picture soundtrack \\"fastbreak\\"/however,there are omissions and weaknesses from this compilation cd.it should have included 'win your love'which was written and produced by her then fiancee stevie wonder in 1970,and at least a few tracks with billy preston from the album \\"billy preston&syreeta\\"(1981)which features the beautiful'someone special'and the discoish beat of'searchin'/the one weakness with this cd is that some of the original tracks were edited from the original lp/album versions.perhaps this should have been a double cd set,therefore all of the songs listed could run in their original time lengths of which they were recorded.and if this were a double cd set,it would've included more unreleased material and rarities such as the stevie wonder written 'win your love'/therefore this would give the beautiful syreeta a near complete overview of her entire career.but motown itself needs 2 give the late beautiful singer more justice by releasing her remaining albums on cd.it would make her fans and myself very happy.syreeta was a very underappreciated and underrated vocalist who never got her due as a talented singer and songwriter and was pretty much under the musical radar.nonetheless,there is still material on this cd from her other albums such as '\\"syreeta\\"(1980)/\\"set my love in motion\\"(1981)/\\"the spell\\"(1983)which was her last full length studio album which was produced by jermaine jackson.this cd also features a duet with smokey robinson,'first time on a ferris wheel(love theme)'which is from the 1985 original motion picture soundtrack,\\"berry gordy's last dragon\\".i grew up with her voice along with stevie's as a child.what makes this collection so sweet is the inclusion of the very beautiful \\"something on my mind\\"/this collection should have included 2 more beautiful syreeta tracks:\\"cause we ended as lovers\\"(1974) and the very beautiful\\"blame it on the sun\\"(1980).the beautiful syreeta's sweetness lives....ith stevie's as a child.what makes this collection so sweet is the inclusion of the very beautiful \\"something on my mind\\"/this collection should have included 2 more beautiful syreeta tracks:\\"cause we ended as lovers\\"(1974) and the very beautiful\\"blame it on the sun\\"(1980).the beautiful syreeta's sweetness lives....
B0000009SG|4.0|I beg to differ with the guy and/ or girl that said FZ is overrated.  \\"Montana\\" is possibly the greatest recording of all time.  The tape manipulations sound incredible.  He had a great vision.  Of coarse he's a goofy guy, but he got it right...he put virtuosity and humor into music and made something that was one-of-a-kind.  F you.
B00065GX64|5.0|This film breathes with the gritty textures and desperation of post-war Germany, people living in the stark and dank aftermath of profound economic and personal depression. I almost felt like I was sleepwalking through someone else's nightmare. That ultimate nightmare where time drags through the surreal streets of utter abstract madness. A madness of people, who would otherwise be civil and respectful to one another, all on the brink of absolute hopelessness steeped in a most fragile sanity, unmasking their most base and animalistic instincts with every new situation and fear.       'M' is much more than the murder of children. It is much more than the story of a murderer. It's really an indictment against 'humanity's' illusion that human beings, the chosen and godly creation made in the image of God, are above the most base instincts of immediate self-preservation when confronted with hunger, fear and survival.       We see how easily human beings turn into a lynch mob when confronted with the unspoken fears that darkly reveal the other, hidden side of human nature. Where I know you because I know me, and that scares me to death. For if your fears and prejudices and unresolved angst and frustrations are as deep-rooted and horrific as mine, then I'm definately not turning my back on you. I'm not even going to let you out of my sight.      This is the paranoia running through the veins and skin within every human being. This is the atmosphere and reality running through this film. This is the message we each need to learn if we are to survive not only the world we all share together, but if one is to learn how to live peacefully and productively within one's skin. This is the message of quiet desperation mixed with a fragile sanity that this film conveyed to me.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|I must admit, this is a \\" like it or hate it \\"  type of movie. Me, I loved it. With Kutcher in a role that doesn't make him seem like an idiot, and the beautiful Amy Smart once again nailing her role, this movie was a thrill ride of enjoyment and a movie that will keep you thinking long after those theatre lights blink back to life. This was not exactly a scary film, but it was a smart thriller, and was highly underrated by critics. With strong performances, and a few jumper scenes, this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat, and will only have your hand moving to get more popcorn. A wonderful movie, maybe the best thriller of 2003-04. P.S... watch the theatrical version, not the directors cut, thank you.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Vol 3 is something new for Slipknot--well not entirely--but harkens to the most melodic tracks of their past, such as Wait and Bleed. <br /> <br />The emotion is still there, bleeding out of each track.  It's just more focused now.  It's no longer a constant yell/thrash/kill vocal tirade.  Instead, these tirades are contextualized with other emotions on the spectrum--frustration, love, cynicism, relegation, despair. <br /> <br />Some of it is a bit commercialized, granted.  Duality and Circle come to mind.  They aren't bad tracks, but I'm guessing they were produced with the masses in mind.  But the majority of tracks don't suffer from this.  Vermilion (parts 1 and 2) and Opium of the People are all outstanding, indicative of Slipknot's best work.  Three Nil and The Blister Exists will throw you back to earlier Slipknot, showing that this band still has \\"it\\" regardless of whether you see \\"it\\" as classic Slipknot or the newer--more mature in my opinion--Slipknot.
B00007AJIT|4.0|This might be the weirdest movie I've ever seen. BJM is about Craig Schwartz, who is a puppeteer who works on the 7 1/2 floor of a building in New York. One day, he finds a door in his office that lets him be John Makovich for 15 minutes and it ditches him on the New Jersey Turnpike. He lets other people try it for $200 and he begins a little something called \\"J.M.INC\\". Mr. Malkovich finds out about it and he wants to find out what's going on. Craig explains that it's a \\"business\\", and that entices him to go into the portal himself.......
B00002Z88D|5.0|I discovered Metallica since the very beginning of their career. I can remember their first appearance in Milan as supporters of Black Metal Band \\"Venom\\" in the early 80s: they had just released their first album \\"Kill 'em all\\", so I knew the songs but I could hardly recognize them becuse the sound was awfully loud and noisy(they were obviously short of money). But this was just the beginning of a new era in Heavy Metal history.     After \\"Ride the Lighting\\", another masterpiece, I lost interest in them and in bands like these (just switched my ears to something different) and I've no fear to say that I completely ignored Metallica until S&M.     This work was for sure a hazard that could not be accepted by most of the fans: for me on the contrary was the rediscovery of this historical band from another point of view. The experiment is great and surely successfully: other bands have tried to do the same and many others have pick up ideas and sounds from the classic music and used (or abused) them.    I don't care if the songs included are the most beautiful, popular or simply the most preferred by fans: it doesn't matter. Metallica's sound and roughness  fit perfectly to the orchestra and the output is extraordinary. Classic music and heavy metal melt together with the right compromise that can satisfied all metallers, except, perhaps, the purest, crudest bangers who can not allow a violin or a trumpet to currupt the integrity of the original sound track. As far as I'm concerned, I wouldn't certainly have listened any more to Metallica if they didn't publish S&M.     But watch out: it's not enough to copy this idea to create a something original and good. You have to choose the proper mix and to amalgamate it in the right way. Metallica have done it.!
B00005JNJ7|5.0|Laughed more than I have at a movie since seeing \\"There's something about Mary\\" for the first time. The humor is *very* crude, as you might expect from Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park. They poke fun at everything and everyone serious in the news these days, which is a great relief. It's nice to be able to look at some of the grim news with a sense of humor. <br /> <br />I'd see it again, but I wouldn't take the kids to it. Yikes! Let the expletives fly!
B0000C8AW2|5.0|I bought this album a few days ago at a sale in Sam Goody.  I indavertantly destroyed the CD a day later, so I ended up at Best Buy.  But anyhow... <br /> <br />As the title states, \\"Painfully brilliant\\" best describes this album.  At the time that Dylan did this album, he was going through a difficult divorce with his wife, Sarah.  The songs on the album are mostly about lost love, failed reconciliation, and emotional desolation.  My favorite songs are \\"Senor (Tales of Yankee Power),\\" \\"No Time To Think,\\" and \\"Baby, Stop Crying.\\"  Runner-ups include \\"True Love Tends To Forget,\\" \\"We Better Talk This Over,\\" \\"Where Are You Tonight?\\", and \\"Changing of the Guards.\\" <br /> <br />A \\"must-have\\" for die-hard Dylan fans like myself.  <br /> <br />-Andrew, Carson CA.

B0000BYM3K|3.0|A solid metal album from these now \\" elder statesmen \\" of heavy metal. While not as impressive as the preceeding, ' Brave New World', this is still a good Maiden release. Standouts are Dance of Death, No More Lies, and Montsegur. The album also has a good ballad in Journeyman. Wildest Dreams should have been left off altogether and although the other songs are somewhat less memorable and innovative they are still solid.  <br />The tone of the album is rather possitive for Iron Maiden but I don't see anything wrong with this. The band are older and presumably wiser now and they may be demonstrating this in their lyrics less sinister content revealing more contentment with life. Of course that's just speculation, but at any rate it still works with their music.
0694516929|4.0|This book is an amusing look at modern business practices and what's wrong with them.  Adams takes us through a short history of business in the 1990s, from down-sizing to right-sizing, from re-engineering to Total Quality Management.  His descriptions, based on his own job titles and tasks, of how the business world has changed is quite revealing.  In the not-so-long-ago good-old-days, people could easily get lost in the bureaucracy of a large company doing time wasting jobs that produced nothing of value for the company.  As things got tighter, in poorly run companies, the rats who could swim did just that, leaving more and more work to be done by people who were, on average, less and less capable.  And the least capable, as well all know, were promoted to management, where they wouldn't be in the way of real work.<br /><br />In the last part of the book, Adams has a few suggestions as an engineer/cartoonist about ideal company management.  He introduces the notion of the OA5 company, or Out At Five.  He suggests that managers maximize efficiency by scheduling meetings only in the afternoons, and late in the afternoons, so that the meetings don't get in the way of real work.  That way, the work gets done despite the meeting, so everyone can get out at 5, which keeps up morale and energy.  Besides, if a meeting is scheduled for 4-5 and everyone wants to get Out At Five, then the interminable chatterers who hog the floor at meetings may keep their traps shut for once so that they too, can go home on time.  Adams argues that the most important task for a manager is to make sure that everyone in the department is a team player, and that people who don't work well or get along well with others should be dismissed.  That way, the others can get more work done and get Out At Five.  I've never studied business management and I don't think Adams has formally either, but these ideas sure sound as good as anything else I've heard on the topic.  In any case, we'll have to wait for the prototype to be built before we can see how the ideas actually work in practice.ait for the prototype to be built before we can see how the ideas actually work in practice. <br />
B000063DI9|5.0|Another example of magnificence from one of Earth's greatest musical ensembles, Iron Maiden's 1988 opus \\"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\\" finds the band performing a more symphonic and grandiose style than ever before (especially exemplified by the mammoth title track), with more acoustic passages than previous albums and the tasteful, non-phony use of synthesizers not to replace instrumentation but to add effect and atmosphere.  All the players add to their personal repertoire here - Bruce Dickinson is a bit older than he was when he gave his stunning vocal performance on his Maiden debut, the \\"Number Of The Beast\\" album, and his voice has grown, enabling him to add even more angles to his already diverse range, bringing in the excellent slightly raspy stuff, and almost husky sounds on gems like 'Infinite Dreams'.  Guitarists Dave Murray and Adrian smith perform some of their best and most distinctive stuff, often in the form of brilliant rhythms in the background one might miss the first couple of times around; Steve Harris just continues to show why so many people consider him the bassist in history; Nicko McBrain pieces in more exotic drumming - sometimes sounding like heavy bells - when called for, in addition to the trademark dynamic Maiden thunder.  Mostly based around the folkore legends concerning 'seventh sons of seventh sons', offspring said to be born with considerable mystical power.  The lyrical content fits in perfectly with books like \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" and \\"The Dark Tower\\" and movies like \\"Dracula\\" or even \\"Princess Mononoke\\".  As usual, Maiden are masters at blending different tempos and moods into the same song without ever seaming or fragmenting the song.  An A-Plus album.
B000003S0B|3.0|I like this album, but I love the debut. Problem is, this one's basically a less impressive rehash of the debut. Not sure if they did it on purpose or what, but the fact of the matter remains that this album has very little to add to the debut. First off, the \\"Peace\\" themes are lame because they don't evoke any sort of compelling mood. \\"Pictures of a City\\" is kinda cool, but sounds kind of like \\"21st Schizoid Man\\" with less direction and more uncessesary noodling. \\"Cadence and Cascade\\" is a beautiful song and one of the better ones, bearing a slight resemblance to \\"I Talk to the Wind\\". The title track is slightly abysmal, but somehow succeeds nonetheless. Sure, they made a rehash, but you have to remember that King Crimson is an amazing band! They did it with some success; they pulled it off and made it still interesting. Not AS interesting, but how do you follow-up In the Court of the Crimson King??? The best songs on here are definatly \\"Cat Food\\" and the terrifying epic \\"The Devil's Triangle\\", which sound not-a-whit like the debut! I think 3 stars is fair, because honestly I don't really listen to this one, except for \\"Cat Food\\" and \\"The Devils Triangle\\". I'm a bigger fan of the Crimson's later work, but this is still good for the die-hard fan.
B000001E2W|5.0|Many Anthrax fans dismiss this album because of the lack of the band's involvement and the sound quality among other things. I think that this is a GREAT album regardless, showing Anthrax in the band's prime. Vocalist Joe Belladonna gives a great vocal performance on all the tracks (Anthrax NEVER shoulda replaced him!!!), while Scott Ian (Best rhythm guitarist EVER!!!!!) and Dan Spitz show why they were one of the best guitar teams in metal (Anthrax NEVER shoulda replaced Spitz either!!!). Charlie Benante beats his kit into submission, playing AMAZING FILLS, and Frank Bello gives a GREAT performance on the bass, throwing in licks here and there. The first 8 tracks were recorded live at Irvine Meadows CA, October 1991, and the last 4 tracks were recorded &quot;Live infront of really cool WSOU listeners&quot; in January of 1992. Highlights include (Efilnikufesin) N.F.L., Parasite, Keep It In The Family, Caught In A Mosh, Antisocial, Bring The Noize w/Public Enemy, I Am The Law, Metal Thrashing Mad, and In My World. Buy it NOW!!!
B000003TAR|4.0|A great album this was. My all-time favorite Nirvana songs appear on this album, but as a whole I don't think In Utero was quite as consistant as Nevermind. Sure, Nevermind was overhyped and overplayed but please, it's not the 90's anymore. With the same argument you could say that too many bands have ripped off the Nevermind sound to truly make it an exciting listen anymore, but that's a complete bs statement. That record WAS radio-friendly but so what? They were better at it than ANYONE else, even if they DID rip off Killing Joke, who sued them and won. The inconcistancies of In Utero have mainly to do with the lazy songwriting. The moronic \\"Rape Me\\", the weak \\"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge\\" and the boring \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" in particular bring the album down. It's pretty unfortunate because this is the best-produced Nirvana album (compliments to Steve Albini) and it contains \\"Milk It\\", \\"Dumb\\", \\"Scentless Apprentice\\", \\"All Apologies\\", \\"Serve the Servants\\" and \\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\\", all of which surpass most of the material on Nevermind. Even so, I could listen to that record the whole way through and not get bored, which I cannot say for this album. Too spotty. Still, it's a beautiful album, and considering what Kurt Cobain was going through at the time, it makes sense that it's not exactly the most consistant album. It's obvious the band wanted a more experimental sound, with rougher production. I'm glad they did it! Regardless of the few weak songs on this album, it's a brilliant work of art and makes for an intense emotional listen.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I got interested in this series when it first aired and became addicted to it whent the series was released for sale. This is a fantastic idea of the future, with strong roots of reality given human history. I am a devout star trek fan and if that is the yardstick for which to measure firefly then it more than measures up. The studio should start the series back up, make tv movie or at least start writng the series in book form. It is/was a wonderful story that I for one would continue to follow.
B00000AF98|5.0|My 3rd favorite KISS Album of all-time. Crazy Nights was the (...) growing up in the late 80's and being a teenager when it was released made it even better. I love almost every song on Crazy Nights and here's a quick review:     #1: \\"Crazy, Crazy Nights\\" Awesome from beginning to end, sounds even better in concert! 5 stars.     #2: \\"I'll Fight Hell To Hold You\\" Good song, too bad it was never played live. 3 stars.     #3: \\"Bang Bang You\\" Another awesome song BUT the live version of this song from Tokyo Japan in April of 1988 BLOWS the studio version AWAY! 5 stars.     #4: \\"No, No, No\\" decent song from Gene and co-wrote by Eric and Bruce. The guitar intro is great. 3 stars.     #5: \\"Hell Or High Water\\" My 9th favorite KISS song. I've loved this song since the first time I heard it back in '87. 5 stars.     #6: \\"My Way\\" Great Paul song with great vocals. KISS has always done it their way :) 4 stars.     #7: \\"When Your Walls Come Down\\" Cool song, love the lyrics. 4 stars.     #8: \\"Reason To Live\\" Awesome ballad from Paul. This song is so good! I just wish they would play it again live ;( 5 stars.     #9: \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" Cool song, love the opening riff from Gene. 3 stars.     10: \\"Turn On the Night\\" My 7th favorite KISS song, GOD I love this one. But it's never been played live ;( WHY? 5 stars.     11: \\"Thief in The Night\\" Great song from Gene, one of Gene's best songs from the CRAZY 80's :) 5 stars.     Don't have Crazy Nights? Then you're NOT a TRUE member of the KISS Army!
B00005UEAR|4.0|I think most people will agree that Metropolis pt. 2: Scenes From a Memory is Dream Theater's best album, and it's quite a feat for them to make an even better one.  Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence almost comes close to doing that.  Disc 1 is good enough, with the best song being The Glass Prison and the instrumental section of Blind Faith a close second.  However, these are nothing compared to Disc 2, the entire 'Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence' song.  This, my friends, is what Dream Theater is all about.  The Overture is a great instrumental introduction to the themes present in following sections (Still not quite sure how much of it is a real orchestra and how much is Jordan Rudess' keyboard tones), and the other sections are great as well.  In my opinion, the best ones are 'War Inside My Head', 'Solitary Shell', and the reprise of 'About to Crash'.  Musically, the song '6' is amazing.  Lyrically, I'm not so sure.  The main lyrical theme seems to be mental unrest, and it works pretty well with the music for the most part, although a little disturbing and downright corny in some sections (The Test That Stumped Them All), but I tolerate it when I listen to all 8 sections as a whole.  If you enjoy prog metal, or just prog in general, I recommend you get this album for the 2nd disc.  More metal-oriented DT fans will probably find Disc 1 more appealing.  4 stars for the 2nd disc alone.
B000002H7I|5.0|Accepting this great album into my collection would have not been possible if I did not search through the $2.99 tape bin at the local record shop.  As soon as I played the tape I was in love.  I was moved by the first 5 hits and two days later I bought the CD.  I think the greatest part of listening to a new song is the feeling as if you heard the songs a hundred times.  This album made those feelings possible.    <br />I advise people if they own Tracy \\"Trapmans\\" debut they must add \\"Crossroads\\" to their collection.  I am not a musician but know great music when I hear it.
B000089CJI|4.0|while i'm not really a fan of any of the members of this groups other projects i'm definetely a big fan of this one. it's very different from anything emo or emo related the brand name corporate america has decided to give that type of music but it definetely experiments with electronica and brings it to a level a lot of musicians in that catagory never achieve. more of a descendent of new order and kraftwerk than the chemical brothers, fatboy slim, etc. will ever hope to be.
0618526412|5.0|Yes, this is a brilliant book.  No, I did not 'enjoy' it!  Matter of fact, it ruined my holiday.  Nothing has ever made me feel so lonely.  It is a life changing book, but not good for your emotional equilibrium!
0804115613|5.0|Fannie Flagg's heartwarming stories never fail to entertain, and the characters in this one are some of the most endearing ones in all of Southern lit.  The deceptively simple story  is told in a witty and light-hearted manner, but delves into such emotionally-charged issues as lesbian relationships, the treatment of minorities, the problems of aging and more in an unforgettable narrative.<br /><br />The story moves effortlessly between two time frames.  The first story begins in the 1920's and centers on Idgie Threadgoode, a female Huck Finn, and her friend Ruth Jamison.  Together, they own and operate the cafe which is the center of small-town life in Whistle Stop, Alabama.<br /><br />The second story begins in 1985 when Evelyn Couch meets Ninny Threadgoode, the now-elderly sister-in-law of Idgie, at the Rose Terrace Nursing Home in Birmingham.<br /><br />The two stories unfold in a light-hearted, folksy way that puts you into the lives of these poignant charaters and has you longing for the neighborly friendliness of a time long past.  Evelyn is, in fact, so touched by Ninny's recollections that she is finally able to take control of her own life through the often hilarious and always inspiring life of Idgie.<br /><br />For a feel-good read where the inherent goodness of people causes them to carry on through good times and bad, I highly recommend this one.
0143034448|5.0|Amusing, insightful and truly worth the title 'classic'.  A lovely critical satire of the times (1800, 1850 and today!)
0786714875|5.0|Reading Shake Hands with the Devil was an interesting experience for me, because I know the authour - General Dallaire was the Commendant of Le College Militaire Royale de St-Jean (think the Quebequois version of West Point) while I was a student there. <br /> <br />In fact, I had the rare opportunity of celebrating the occasion of my 21st birthday well into the night in the company of the General, when my squadron mess dinner happened to coincide with my anniversaire. <br /> <br />I can say from personal experience that General Dallaire was not only the most professional officer I ever met, but also one of the best people. His sense of personal duty, honour, and most importantly, his deep-rooted humanity absolutely embody the essence of being Canadian. In a school where the golden rule was \\"lead by example\\" General Dallaire both talked the talk and walked the walk. <br /> <br />Which is what makes this book even the more tragic. <br /> <br />This is the story of a great man in an impossible circumstance, who does all in his power to avert catastophe, and who never gives up trying to win the battle for the side of good and civilization. That he was thwarted is a comment on us, not on him. <br /> <br />Read this book. Learn the lessons the General has to teach.
B000002UAU|5.0|This isn't my favorite Beatles album, that would be Rubber Soul, but it's number 2. The thing about this album is if you don't have time to sit and listen to the album in its entirety then you miss out on the Sgt. Pepper's experience. This album does have a few great songs that can stand alone by themselves and could have made top ten singles easily (lucy in the sky, she's leaving home, getting better). Anyway, I love this album and every song goes so well with the other. If you don't own this album, buy it now even though you'll be paying Michael Jackson, which sucks.

B00005JNEI|5.0|michael moore is very popular here in germany. some years ago, bowling for columbine was an remarkable sucsess, but it was nothing to the overwelming start of fahrenheit 9/11. <br />why we love michael moore ?  <br />the answer is that we love the american way of life, we watch the us-movies, eat us-style pizza read stephen king (and some guys like me do their wedding in hawaii...). <br />but the main reason is, we don't liek mr. bush an his gouverment. <br />the prosecutor in nurnberg 1945 argue, that for the planning of an war several german generals must be returned guilty. <br /> <br />now the president mr. bush declared that osama and saddam ar some kind of old friends. everybody knowns, that saddam husseins greatest fear was an fundamental islamic coalition in the iraq. <br />in fact, his foreign minister was tarik aziz was one of the severn percent christian iraqi citizen. <br /> <br />after 9/11 everbody suports the american gouverment, after the war against the iraq, mr. bush's reputation is as worse as nixons after watergate. <br /> <br />during dessert shield there was an coalition from us, europe an some islamic states. after 9/11 the world was proud to stand united we you. <br /> <br />now with mr. bush, the us stand alone. mr. blair loose every lokal election, the gouverment was voted out of office in spain and poland.  <br /> <br />and thats why we the the sarcastic movies and books from michael moore. <br />

0553583182|5.0|Having received bunch of emails from people who have read this book, but still had difficulty applying the principles in this, I felt compelled to share few ideas.<br /><br />First, the principles in this book are correct and they work if you apply them.  The book is about using the power of your subconscious mind.  As I read over some previous reviews here, I noticed that some people stumbled upon the language and pointed out that one should read \\"As A Man Thinketh\\" (yes, it is a good book to read), and made a reference to \\"as you think in your HEART\\" - not mind.  Another name for the SUBCONSCIOUS is HEART of the MIND, because SUBCONSCIOUS MIND is the REALM OF EMOTIONS.<br /><br />Some people also erroneously think that the subconscius mind is in one's head, it isn't.  It is not even confined to your physical body, but permeates it.  Your physical body is IN your MIND.  Another way to describe the subconscious may be to refer to it as your \\"energy field\\" (that may be somewhat more modern \\"language\\").  Do not get stuck to words and labels, though.  They are merely useful to help describe things - they are not the experience itself.<br /><br />To use self-hypnosis successfully, to use the power of your mind successfully, it is not enough to just repeat the words mechanically (although, with a lot of repetition, they too will be impressed upon your subconscious mind), but you must also use your feelings - EXPERIENCING the outcome you desire AS IF it were REAL for you now - subjectively.<br /><br />The term subconscious mind is used to refer to your own individual storehouse of knowledge and memories.  The term \\"superconscious\\", or \\"universal mind\\", \\"God\\", and sometimes in hypnosis the term \\"unconscious\\" are used to refer to the infinite storehouse of knowledge, which you access through your subconscious mind.<br /><br />There is ONLY ONE Mind, but for the convenience we have divided it linguistically into three minds, according to its functions - conscious, subconscious and superconscious.  You can imagine that there is one door standing between your conscious and subconscious mind and another between your subconscious and superconscious.  You access both your subconscious and superconscious by getting the critical faculty of your conscious mind out of the way and the easiest way to do this is by fully engaging your imagination and your emotions.<br /><br />Because you access your subconscious and superconscious mind in the same way, people sometimes just use the term \\"subconscious\\" to refer to both functions.  Instead of using the world superconscious, Murphy sometimes uses he word \\"God\\" - which I like, but some people feel very uncomfortable with due to their religious upbringing or lack of understanding and direct experience (A Course in Miracles is one books that may help in that respect).<br /><br />Your conscious mind is that part of your mind that judges things and contemplates whether you can or cannot do something.  It compares things and when you attempt to use your conscius mind and work on some goal, it may pop up with all the reasons why something may not be possible for you to do.  Your subconscious mind goes for DIRECT EXPERIENCE.  It doesn't judge whether something is possible or impossible, good or bad - it merely ACCEPTS as true and real whatever you EXPERIENCE as REAL subjectively.<br /><br />When you pick a goal to work on with your subconscious, make sure that it is something that is BELIEVABLE to you.  Whatever ideas you desire to impress upon your subconscious mind will work in conjunction with that which is already in your subconcious mind - so if the ideas and beliefs which are currently in your subconscious are in conflict with your desired goal, it will take you a long time to experience the desired results.  If you begin with things you are willing to accept as possible for you, you'll get much faster results and you'll also condition your mind for success and to the world of many new wonderful possibilities.<br /><br />Also, keep in mind, that you are in one way or another programming your subconscious mind with every thought you think.  So, if you are using self-hypnosis to help you create greater abundance and you are working on your goal for half an hour a day, then you spend the other 23 hours contemplating how you don't have money to pay the bills, you're just undoing all that work you invested in self-hypnosis.  Once you are done with your mind-programming, whenever you think of your goal, you'll make it happen much faster if you spend time expecting the positive outcome and giving thanks that what you desire is already yours, or at least that it is on its merry way to you.<br /><br />This lovely book teaches you how to use the power of your mind in many different areas in your life.  It also provides examples from the lives of others who have successfully used the power of their mind to overcome numerous obstacles and create what their hearts desired.  This little stories may serve you as an inspiration until you have an assortment of your own success stories to tell - and if you genuinely apply the principles in this book, you'll have many great stories of your own.new wonderful possibilities. <br /> <br />Also, keep in mind, that you are in one way or another programming your subconscious mind with every thought you think.

0876304420|5.0|The focus of this book is The Coopration Principle in Ericksonian Hypnotherapy.  Gilligan first points out the differences between authoritarian method of using hypnosis, which was common before Erickson entered the picture and the permissive method, indirect hypnosis used by Erickson.  The focus of the book is on what distinguishes Ericksonian hypnosis from traditional hypnosis, namely UTILIZATION of whatever state the client is in to help to liberate the client from the limitation that is at the core of the problem.<br /><br />Instead of forcing the client to fit the hypnotist's modus operandi, the therapist becomes flexible and shapes his approach according to the personality, background, understanding, preferences of the client - thus the therapist co-operates with the client, working together with the client toward facilitating the solution.<br /><br />The main purpose of the hypnotherapist is to help the client to access his inner resources.  Erickson had great faith into the resourcefulness of the client's unconscious mind, and rather than insisting on any particular method, used his skills to help the client draw the resources from within.  This principle was later popularized through one of the NLP presuppositions which states that \\"everyone has all the resources he may need to reach the desired outcome\\".  These resources may not be obvious to one's conscious mind, but they are there - within the individual's unconscious.<br /><br />The reason that the traditional hypnosis sometimes worked and sometimes didn't is because hypnotists learned one method, one script and then used it indiscriminately on everyone.  This unfortunately is still the case with the common hypnosis training which is based entirely upon the methods used in traditional hypnosis.<br /><br />Traditional hypnotist may run into a lot of client resistance, because he is attempting to force one method upon everyone.  Ericksonian hypnotist will utilize the resistance to guide the person into a trance - thus Ericksonian hypnotist cooperates with whatever the client presents and uses that very same thing to help the client.<br /><br />Utilization also implies using the client's model of the world.  If the client's model of the world is limited to the point that it is causing the client to experience the problem, the hypnotist will enter that model of the world and use it, to help the client out.  In order for a hypnotist to be able to do this successfully, he may have to be very flexible and at least temporarily accept the client's model of the world, rather than forcing his own world-view upon the client.  By meeting with the client in client's model of the world, the hypnotist establishes rapport with the client.  Rapport is the most crucial aspect of hypnosis - without it hypnotist won't get anywhere.<br /><br />Learning Ericksonian hypnosis will sky-rocket the success-rate of any hypnotist's practice.rson into a trance - thus Ericksonian hypnotist cooperates with whatever the client presents and uses that very same thing to help the client.   <br /> <br />Utilization also implies using the client's model of the world.

B00000J7JO|4.0|i love this cd, i think its their best they have ever done, plus they got the estranged john frusciante back, hes my fav guitarist. the best song on here i think is scar tissue. <br />im giving this 4 stars only because of the song porcelain, i think its just crap,its slow and really quite boring, but if you can get past that then this album rocks. id also recomend their other albums \\"mothers milk\\",\\"by the way\\" and \\"bloodsugarsexmagik\\"
B000031WD9|3.0|Oh man this guy is just a straight up loser. In the opening scene his mother catches him with a sock. Later his dad catches him raping a pie, he prematurly 'blows it' twice with a worldwide audience watching him, he finally decides that he hates sex while still a virgin.<br /><br />Well sex comedies have come a long way, but this was a bit ridiculous. When I was in high school my mom caught me in my room with a girl, and I got caught by the cops with another girl in a car. That's real life and it can be funny. It's a bit stupid to film a guy going down on a girl with a homemade instruction manuel.<br /><br />Stiffler saves this movie. If I had to choose a girl on here to do, it would be the band chick.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|\\"Van Hesling\\" is yet another movie based on a series of comic books. I can comment only on the movie as a movie, as I am unfamiliar with the series. I can say that, by its look, the film is faithful to its comic book origins.  <br /> <br />As a movie, \\"Van Helsing\\" is a handsome product, which like director Stephen Sommer's other big hits, \\"The Mummy\\" and \\"The Mummy Returns\\", suffers from too much reliance on computer generated special effects. The opening, a homage to Universal Studio's horror films of the 1930s, is glorious. The introduction to the anti-hero Van Helsing is also intriguing. Here is a man who doesn't know who he really is and who is a pawn of the Catholic Church. His is an interesting conflict. <br /> <br />The movie proceeds to Romania, circa 1890. It's a country in turmoil, its people ruled by fear and superstition. And why not? Vampires and werewolves abound.  <br /> <br />Van Hesling [High Jackman] is dispatched by the Church to Romania to finally take care of the nasty Count Dracula. There he meets the amazing Anna [Kate Beckinsdale], a princess whose family Dracula [Richard Roxburgh] has been trying to destroy for centuries.  <br /> <br />For the most part, \\"Van Helsing\\" is good fun. It's a great adventure. What bogs it down is the special effects. Initially, they are interesting. The problem is that these effects go on and on and on. This causes the movie to run at least thirty minutes longer than the story requires. The movies \\"Van Helsing\\" pays homage to ran anywhere from seventy to ninety minutes. \\"Van Hesling\\" itself runs one hundred and thirty minutes, mainly because it insists on running the same `cool' special effects over and over again. [Note to Hollywood: Less is more.] <br />
B0006213WG|2.0|It's nice that Sum 41 is adding a bit of metal flavor into their sound and all, but do they need to resort to outright rip-offs of other bands? I mean, the oh-so-clever reference to \\"Master of Puppets\\" in the acoustic intro would have been acceptable had they not completely stolen the chorus and chord progressions from the classic \\"Battery\\" from the same album on \\"The Bitter End\\". That's really about as close as you can get to copying a song without getting sued. The ending might as well be note-for-note. <br /> <br />Sorry, but I'm not paying to listen to recycled music.

B00005JMUL|5.0|THE POLAR EXPRESS is the first ever full length movie released in IMAX 3-D! The film is opening on Nov 10th in thousands of theatres nationwide in a flat 2-D version; and in Giant Screen IMAX 3-D in equipped theatres on the same day. <br /> <br />Don't bother with the flat version, see it in 3-D. This is polarized 3-D using clear glasses, not the inferior red/blue anaglyph stuff used for SPY KIDS. Take your kids to a REAL 3-D movie!
B00000DG1R|2.0|I can deal with this album for the most part and I think they picked a fan-worthy ensemble of songs... <br />HOWEVER - why in the hell would you use the cut radio version of songs on a \\"Best Of\\" CD!?!!!!???  I was pissed.  For \\"Rio\\" and \\"Ordinary World\\" I ended up having to download them so that I could enjoy the sax solo and extended guitar solo from OW.  That pretty much destroyed the album for me, but that's the way it goes, I guess.

0312995423|2.0|Tom Clancy and Michael Crichton are known for their engrossing plots backed up by a ton of technical details.  Similarly, Dan Brown attempts to add depth to Digital Fortress by adding details about cryptography, the internet, and other technical subjects.  The big difference is that, in Brown's case, many of these technical details are incorrect.  While this may not prevent everyone from enjoying this novel, the mistakes were too much of a distraction for me to ignore.

B00005MCX0|4.0|It was difficult at first to appreciate this album. Since I got the album after it (&quot;Doremi Fasol Latido&quot;) and the album before it (&quot;Hawkwind&quot;) prior to purchasing this, I felt like the music was an evolutionary link between one album and the next. It was a big improvement from the band's debut, yet not quite their brilliant third album. However, after listening to it vigorously, I came to appreciate it. My favourite song on this is &quot;We Took The Wrong Step Years Ago&quot;, though the tracks throughout are nicely balanced between instrumental songs, completely and utterly tripped out songs, and nice guitar songs.<BR>&quot;Children of the Sun&quot; reminds me vaguely of anything unplugged by Radiohead, I wonder if it was a source of inspiration.<BR>Overall, worth the purchasing price and then some.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Hmmm...Let me think of something in 'Troy' that has never been the subject or in an epic before. Oh, Peter O'Toole! Wait, nope, 'Lawrence of Arabia'. Oh, I know, an almost operatic vocal score, wait no, 'Bravheart', 'Galdiator'. Let me think, oh, I know now. Brad Pitt! Yes, now thats a first for a war epic! A golden country boy! Maybe a cliche there might have actually been nice.  <br />  Don't misunderstand me, I liked Troy as well as I enjoy Gym. Sure its fun for a bit, but after the first hour you just get stinky and tired. Yes, the movie ran long. Why? I dont know, they cut most of the actual story out so it could have been quite short. It's perhaps the dialogue scenes.  <br />  There were only two performances in this movie that deserve any real credit. Eric Bana(Hector) and Peter O' Toole. Bana came off of Hulk with a not so good reputation, and, I would hope, came out of Troy proving he had chops. Peter O' Toole is Peter O' Toole. The only role I could think of his playing poorly is Harry or Lloyd.  <br />  When watching the dialogue scenes in this movie between Paris(Orlando Bloom), Achilles(Brad Pitt), or Helen(Diane Krueger), I winced. I've done a bit of acting myself and my friend at the movie gave me a funny look as I leaned forward trying to coach the actors into portraying the feelings they needed to. And dear Lord, did they need to.  <br />  The butt shots were also very annoying. There wasn't any real purpose to them besides the fact that sex sells-which sickens me. The greatest directors(Kurosawa, Hitchcok, etc.) never NEVER needed to use sex like Peterson obviously needed to. A guy can only take so much of Brad's belly button.  <br />   The good thing about the movie is its action. For all the director failed to do, he was able to coreograph and do special effects. The first fight with Brad Pitt and the giant guy is so awesome and just plain cool looking that it almost literally took my breathe away.  <br />   Anyways, overall the movie is good once. If you don't have very high standards as acting goes and are primarily concerned with action, go for this one. Otherwise, watch it once.
B000063DIH|5.0|When I read reviews about this album, the reviewers see Fear Of The Dark as an album with some standout tracks but also a lot of fillers. I do not really agree. Sure songs like \\"Apparition\\" and \\"Weekend Warrior\\" do not belong to Maiden's best work, but these songs are far from weak. The main reason why I like this album is the diversity of it. Fast songs/slow songs, raw songs/atmospheric songs and complex songs/simple songs. On this album you can hear influences from Bruce Dickinson's solo-album Tattooed Millionaire. The songs are bluesier and Bruce's vocal style is rawer and less high. The album sound is also rawer than on most Maiden albums. Gers his guitar-style is probably an important reason why the album sounds so different compared to earlier albums. (He also played guitar on Tattooed Millionaire.) You recognize his raw bluesy sound more than on his Maiden debut No Prayer For The Dying.     On this album Maiden uses keyboards, but not as much as for example on Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son. On some songs you can hear the direction Maiden was heading for in the future. Especially the keys in a song like \\"Afraid To Shoot Strangers\\" remind me of the album the X-Factor. Acoustic guitars are more prominent on this album. I would go as far as to say that there are more songs with acoustic guitars on this album than on all earlier albums together. This does not mean that Maiden plays softer music. The acoustic guitars are mostly played at the same time as the electric guitars. Furthermore Fear Of The Dark contains a lot of heavy guitar playing. I also personally think that this album is the last Maiden album that contains plenty of excellent and noteworthy guitar-solo's. The lyrics on this album are more down to earth and about more actual themes than on earlier albums. They are for example songs about the Golf war in Iraq, hooligans and aids.      The album opens with the fast and furious \\"Be Quick Or Be Dead\\". The song style reminds me of the style on the album Killers. \\"From Here To Eternity\\" is a simple but catchy rocker. Dickinson's solo-album influences can really be heard on this song. \\"Afraid To Shoot Strangers\\" is about the first Golf war. The song starts out with slow melodic guitars and sensitive vocals. Halfway the music shifts up a few gears and then some fast riffs and solo's take over the song. The song finally ends the way it started. \\"Fear Is The Key\\" is a heavy blues driven song, with a for Maiden unusual twist halfway. I really like the combination of the electric and acoustic guitar-parts on this song. \\"Childhood's End\\" starts out with a great melodic part with cool drumming. Check out the up-tempo melodic part in the song. \\"Wasting Love\\" is one of few Maiden songs that can be described as a ballad. Still a great song. \\"Fugitive\\" starts with a, for Maiden, brutal guitar intro. The song combines heavy guitar playing with some atmospheric guitar playing. \\"Chains Of Misery\\" is sing-along rocker in the vein of \\"From Her To Eternity\\".     \\"Apparition\\" is a song that is mostly based on one riff. The first couple of times I heard this song I really hated the song. Nowadays I really appreciate this song. Especially the heavy and atmospheric middle-part with fast solo's and harmonies. \\"Judas Be My Guide\\" starts out with a harmony guitar part and a solo. The song is rather short but catchy. It is one of Maiden's most underrated songs. \\"Weekend Warrior\\" is a song about football hooligans. The main riff sounds like an AC/DC riff. Although this is an average Maiden song, the combination of electric and acoustic guitars work extremely well on this song. The strongest parts of the song are the guitar solo's and one of Maiden's best guitar harmonies I have ever heard. The titeltrack \\"Fear Of The Dark\\" closes the album. It is one of the strongest songs on the album. Lyrically the song reminds me of the title track from the album Killers.  It starts with an up-tempo harmony, and shortly after that the songs slows down with more atmospheric guitars. Bruce starts to sing with a creepy voice. After the intro Maiden plays one of their most impressive riffs. It as a fast but still melodic riff. It almost sounds like a riff from a melodic Black Metal band. The song stays up-tempo till the end of the song. The song ends in the same way as it started. Fear Of The Dark is one of the most diverse and interesting albums from Iron Maiden. Buy or die. (Just kidding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

068987474X|5.0|OK, I admit it: I have used all of the excuses in this book.  I am the \\"excuses for guys\\" queen (when I'm not busy fuming over their behavior).<br /><br />And I admit, there are not that many good men out there...but why create even fewer good men by encouraging bad behavior?<br /><br />Bottom line: Everyone is not going to love you and you are not going to love everyone.  You don't even have to love the guys who want to be with you...because if you pretend you are out of (a) loneliness, (b) desire to be in a relationship or at least have a date next Saturday night, or (c) unwillingness to hurt feelings, then you're just as guilty as the guys in this book of maddening behavior.  It does't matter if his parents love you or if your parents love him...who are you marrying?  (And if he doesn't want to be around your family, forget it.)<br /><br />Your time is worth more than that.  I don't understand all the women who wrote to Greg Behrendt saying he is encouraging women to be needy.  Ahem!  Since when has valuing ourselves and being strong independent women (who don't need just any man to be happy) been considered needy?<br /><br />This book is as funny as \\"Sex and the City,\\" perhaps because it's from two \\"City\\" writers.  The news that guys aren't that complex is nothing new, but we all need a reminder, especially when it's delivered humorously.

B0002OERI0|5.0|i've been a fan of green day ever since i heard &quot;good riddance (time of your life)&quot;, shortly after i had gone out and bought their Nimrod album, i then shorlty bought every green day album i could find. After listening to their music for years now, i find that &quot;American Idiot&quot; is their best album to date. With different beats, and new lyrics, i find that this album is nothing like their others, with hits like &quot;American Idiot&quot;, &quot;Wake Me Up When September Ends&quot;, and &quot;Jesus Of Suburbia&quot; this power-drivin trio has taken their careers on a whole new level. i wish i could give this album more than 5 stars, with 21 new tracks, I have not yet been dissapointed when listening to a track, or listening to an album. i really encourage that if you get the chance to go out and buy the album. You will not be dissapointed
B000003Z6I|5.0|This debut solo album by Cave has grown in stature down the years. The mood is Goth, the songs are mostly folkie laments, both lyrically and melodically impressive, his voice is like dark red velvet and the whole is dark, brooding and atmospheric. With the superb backing of Bad Seeds Blixa Bargeld, Mick Harvey, Barry Adamson and Anita Lane, this album is just perfect in its blood-cuddling rawness. I love the eerie cover of Leonard Cohen's Avalanche, whilst the striking images in Cabin Fever elevates an ordinary tune into the unforgettable. Well Of Misery stands out for its interesting vocal arrangement. Cave's cover of Elvis' In The Ghetto is quite stunning. The title track is an anguished and harrowing love song with atmospheric vocal samples and industrial infusions. With these songs Cave established himself in the great tradition of artists like Cohen, Richard Thompson (in his dark moments), Tom Waits, Peter Murphy and Michael Gira, as a master of the deep, dark lament.
B000002HAJ|5.0|I think that this CD is amazing.  A friend lent this CD to me and once I gave it back to her I found that I could not get the songs out of my head.  \\"Open\\" is intoxicating.  \\"Deep Green Sea\\", once you listen to the lyrics and the guitar together' makes you want to cry.  \\"Wendy Time\\" is very sassy.  \\"Cut\\" is just cool and catchy!  Invest in it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I can still remember the day I heard the album 'dookie' for the first time, in 1993, it was the first time I had heard of Green Day and I liked it alot. I then proceeded to pick up thier older albums (Kerplunk, 1039 Smoothed Out Slap Happy Hours) and enjoyed them immensely. Then came Insomniac, I was let down, the songs just didn't grip me in the same fashion. Nimrod kept the downward spiral going, and I threw out Warning the same day I purchased it. Totally skipped the rest of thier records. Now, here it is, over 10 years later, when I hear the familiar voice of Billy Joel coming out of a radio in Jesus of Suburbia, proceeded to the store, and checked American Idiot out on a listening station(a great invention). This album is amazing, great riffs, vocals, and it flows well. I can listen to it from start to finish. My faith has been restored. I highly recommend this album to anyone who is or was or is not a fan of Green Day, listening to it first of course
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Well, where can I start? Dream Theater are such an amazing band, transending progressive rock, and even progressive metal. I prefer to label them as jazz metal, at times sounding similar to Return To Forever, a jazz band of the 70s. James LaBrie's voice is always top notch, very atmospheric and powerful, even though he does over-do the high-pitched vocals at times. On ToT however, he sounds angry, tormented and... well, beautiful. To back up his atmospheric voice, you have the best musicians in music today - John Myung, he constantly drives the band along with his bass work, never coming up for air. His rhthym section partner, Mike Portnoy... wow. As a fellow drummer I can't get enough of his enormous talent. The opening salvo on Honour Thy Father is visceral, and he is the only drummer I know that uses double bass for someting other than the thrash metal sound. Jordan Rudess... now I don't know much about keyboards, but I do know that I am always amazed by his ability to replicate John Petrucci's guitar solos on keyboard. As for John, he is such a virtuoso, ok his solos can get a bit repetitive, but they're just so damn good you don't care! Now, the album. Not DT's most varied album, but definately their darkest, most brutal album, and I don't think I've ever heard anything as grim as Honour Thy Father. In songs such as This Dying Soul and Endless Sacrifice, the instrumentalists take the listeners to another level - they enter another world, being completely taken over by the music, forgetting the song structure and replacing it with the most complex musicianship today. Only James brings them back to Earth to finish the song. James's voice on the track 5 (forgot what it's called!) is beautiful, the only song on the album which shows his quieter, vulnerable side. And the climax, In The Name Of God... wow! Quite the epic, with a good message behind the vocals. As great as this album is, I believe Metropolis Part 2, Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence and Falling Into Infinty are all slightly better. DT are really keeping the experimental, instumental side of music alive. All aspiring musicians should look to this band for inspiration.
B000062YB1|5.0|This album is, without a doubt, Slayers best album. The production is great, and the songs are literally all awesome. This album has everything! Fast songs, slower songs, and there's the awesome title track. The title track to this album is by a long shot the best song the band ever made. Possibly the greatest thrash song of all time. And while War Ensemble only just about misses Angel Of Death from Reign In Blood, it's still a great song. Here is the basic status of each song. <br /> <br />1. War Ensemble - A great opener, similar to Angel Of Death in speed etc, this is a totally classic Slayer song. 95/100 <br />2. Blood Red - Its slightly slower, but its still a great song with a catchy enough chorus. 79/100 <br />3. Spirit In Black - This is another classic, almost touches War Ensemble. 90/100 <br />4. Expenable Youth - This is very good, but the subject is boring and I dont like it's structure. 74/100 <br />5. Dead Skin Mask - BRILLIANT song. This is better than Ensemble. Its not as fast, but the beginning is amazing, and its simply amazing overall. It's about serial killer Ed Gein (obvious at the end when the girl is crying \\"Let me ouuut, Mr.Gein!) 98/100 <br />6. Hallowed Point - Another great song, which I never really got into until recently... 80/100 <br />7. Skeletons Of Society - A great song, I like the choruses. 81/100 <br />8. Temptation - It's not bad, but it isn't quite as good as any of the other songs. 74/100 <br />9. Born Of Fire - Simply put, this is another War Ensemble. Brilliant. 89/100 <br />10. Seasons In The Abyss - The greatest thrash song of all time, and im not just saying that. I prefer Metallica to Slayer, but this song is just amazing. 100/100
B00028HBKC|1.0|I reject this movie for Christian reasons. I found it totally hideous and offensive to see a portrayal of Jesus Christ, the Lord and Savior, cinematically degraded to the level of a pornographic snuff film. No, I did not expect a portrayal of the Crucifixion to be neat or dignified, but I did not expect it to be a horror ride through the ignorance and the superstition of the Bloody Middle Ages either. This is just graphic shock and bloody trauma. <br /> <br />This whole movie is an absurd distortion of the descriptions in the Gospels. I cannot believe that anyone equipped with a New Testament could compare the images in this movie with Biblical accuracy. All boundaries of biological, historical, and scriptural realities are broken here. (And WHY are Mary and Mary Magdalene dressed like a pair of 13th Century NUNS?) <br /> <br />I reject the satanic symbolism in this movie: a snarling wolfman; demonized children; a writhing maggoty corpse; a satanic baby; a blood thirsty raven--these are the images of a  Hollywood horror flick and have no place in a Christian movie. <br /> <br />The one recognizably human moment is when Jesus falls down and Mary runs to comfort her son. That moment felt humanly real. The one recognizable Christian message here is that Jesus did God's Will and died for us, and he showed love and forgiveness even toward his tormentors. But, otherwise, no sane or sacred concept of God or Jesus or humanity had anything to do with this movie.
B00000IL26|5.0|Not only a bluenote hit but a true Hardbop album. \\"Sidewinder\\" is probably the weakest song hear but it still has a great blues groove. Solos by Morgan and Henderson are some of my favorites. \\"Totem Pole\\" has to be the best track on this album, Lee and Higgins played together on so many bluenote albums but this has to be their best. Lees solos are a big contrast to Joe's. Lee did not intend to make a challenging album but when you listen to the themes, it's kind of hard not to ask yourself \\"How did he come up with this stuff!\\". This was one of my first Bluenote albums and one of my best. Lee Morgan was, in my opinion, Bluenotes most valuable musician. \\"Gary's Notebook\\" and \\"Boy What a Night\\" have very challenging lines but great chord changes to solo over. The thing about \\"SideWinder\\" is that it spawned a whole bunch more \\"trying to be\\" sidewinder hits. Unfortunatly none ofthem were very good and none of them were hits either. Other excellent Lee Morgan Albums: \\"Search for the New Land\\", \\"Lee-way\\". For the Hardcore Morgan fans: \\"Gigolo\\", \\"Cornbread\\", \\"Procrastinator\\".
B00008OWZC|5.0|When I heard this cd earlier this spring I wasn't really into Led Zep.  I had heard them but I hadn't really listened to them on that level if you dig...  This blew my mind and I subsequently borrowed the complete box set from a buddy of mine and put it on my ipod.  Long story short, nothing that I found on the studio albums had anything on this.  Although it is missing a couple of my favorites like \\"the lemon song\\" and \\"thank you\\" it's made up for in the versions of \\"stairway\\", \\"that's the way\\" and especially a rocked out \\"over the hills and far away\\" which in this revisited format is my favorite zep song by far.  Quite possibly the best collection of music I've ever heard, and to think that every show past 73' consisted of all these tracks and more!  This really is music at it's best.
B0002OERI0|4.0|There have been quite a few comparisons drawn between The Who's \\"Tommy\\" and Green Day's new conceptual offering. I suppose there are some parallels but, come on, did anyone out there ever hear of \\"Quadrophenia\\"? That was Pete Townsend's other full length rock opera and the one that I would suggest is more of an obvious inspiration for \\"American Idiot\\". \\"Quad\\" was about a troubled teen with split personalities (the self-destructive one was named Dr. JIMMY...hmmm...a coincidence?) who takes drugs, rebels, leaves home, feels alienated, cheated by society, hits rock bottom, has a spiritual epiphany, etc, etc, etc. It's the timeless, universal story of youthful rebellion and angst; a familiar tale to which each generation is entitled its own artistic variations.  <br /> <br />Speaking of familiar, \\"American Idiot\\" is positively overflowing with hooks and riffs that sound suspiciously like any number of Rock icons including The Clash (we expected that), Ramones (ditto), The Beatles, Mott the Hoople, The Alarm, as well as punk contemporaries like Bad Religion and Rancid. Did anyone notice how \\"Tales of Another Broken Home\\" recalls Social Distortion's version of Johnny Cash's \\"Ring of Fire\\"? In a way, it's quite impressive when I realize how many steals Billie Joe and company can actually fit into a single song or operatic medley, as the case may be. <br />   <br />So now you may be wondering why I give this record four stars. Aside from the obvious Who connection, the whole thing comes across as a wonderful homage to every other classic \\"concept\\" album of the past thirty years from \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", to Bowie's \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" to Husker Du's \\"Zen Arcade\\" (which also had a very similar \\"story\\"). In that respect, I don't mind the musical plagiarism at all. Besides, who looks to Green Day for originality and grand themes? I look to them for well executed, catchy, exciting, undeniable Rock & Roll. In short, I look for the rush and, to the degree that they deliver such goods, I begin applying stars.  <br /> <br />So then, is \\"American Idiot\\" a masterpiece? Let's see if it holds up as well as \\"Quadrophenia\\" or \\"Zen Arcade\\" in a few years. I suspect it might. <br />Is it the \\"record of the year\\"? Clearly.   <br />
B000002KKS|5.0|This was the fourth Sabbath album I got after Paranoid, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Master of Reality, I started to listen to Neon Knights, and Dio's voice didn't really sound right after listening to Ozzy for such a long time. I had to go so i never even got to finish the first song. It kind of sat there on my shelf for two or so weeks, and then I finally decided to listen to it. I put it in and turned up the volume and I fell in love with it. The guitaring is wonderful and the song Heaven and Hell is one of those songs that would solely make an album worth buying. Great buy for Sabbath or metal fans.
1591840562|5.0|I've helped start a handful of companies (and am in the middle of assisting a start-up now!), so I thought I knew all there is to know about starting up. But this book was very helpful even for a cynical (...) like me.    Guy's writing style is conversational, informative and easy-to-read with well-organized chapters and nice summaries at the end. I didn't start this book at the beginning, but jumped around reading what I thought would be relevant to me -- but I ended up reading the whole thing anyway. Very inspirational and informative!
B000002UZ4|5.0|This band is great.I only bought it for two songs: It's a Sin and Domino Dancing, but i found in this compilation more gems of that ilk: Suburbia and Jealousy, to name a few! <br />When i listen to Pop i want this (beautiful melodies, soaring choruses,great dynamics, catchy stuff, drama, intensity and great lyrics)and not rehashed music, processed voices - that can't really sing - and over the top videos and sexual choreography to disguise musical and lyrical shortcomings.I will not give names, because we all know them - and loathe them. <br />Buy this to just enjoy the quality of greatly made Pop and maybe to dance for those who care about that type of thing.I guarantee that it will delight your ears and soul! <br />
0060987464|5.0|I was always fascinated by Marilyn Manson, most likely due to his eccentric and \\"anti-christ-like\\" image. Anyway, I ended up picking up this book and reading it when I was at a bookstore one day and I couldn't put it down. Well, an hour later, I had to leave so I was forced to put it down. But you can believe that I came back to that bookstore for a week straight and read that book in portions of 20 minutes. To this day, I feel guilty for not purchasing such an interesting read. I will one day MM, I promise. =)

B000000Y1H|5.0|Perfection is a strange word to apply to something as spontaneous as jazz - but somehow it is applicable to this brilliant recording of Thelonious Monk - who is at the top of his game here.  No other Monk recording compares to this one in my opinion - and the ensemble is top-notch. Check this one out!

B00005YJMX|5.0|Herzog blows the breath of life into this tale - kind of a dedication to another great German director - Murnau. This is filmed with a gorgeous detatched feel - common to Herzog's best films. This one also boasts the talents of Bruno Ganz - who you may recognize as the star of 'Wings of Desire' and 'The American Friend'. Herzog gives the tale his own interpretation of the tale - wisely avoiding the remake approach - and throwing his own insight onto this almost tortured looking count dracula - played by Kinski - who is, as always, really into the role. This ranks as one of Herzog's best - and certainly one of the best of the genre of horror films!
B000002ADT|5.0|If you're one of the many who feel that Jazz is merely &#34;nervous noise,&#34; then may I have the honor of introducing what is considered the greatest Jazz album of all time?  This CD is, how can I say this, sublime.  Every instrument (and what a cast! Cannonball Adderly and 'Trane on sax, Bill Evans on piano, and Paul Chambers' bass and Jimmy Cobb's drums create a rhythm section with no spaces) seems to cry out &#34;This is primo jazz, folks!&#34; And no less an authority than - DUANE ALLMAN! told reviewer Robert Palmer (no, not the &#34;Addicted To Love&#34; musician by that name) that, &#34;I've listened to &#62;Kind Of Blue&#60; so many times for the past couple of years, I haven't hardly listened to anything else.&#34;  I can dig why Duane said that.  &#62;Kind Of Blue&#60;, without being sacreligious, is almost spiritual...

B00000IOSU|2.0|Sarah's \\"Mirrorball\\" album is an overproduced, uninspired work.  Anyone who has seen Sarah live should know that this live album doesn't do her justice at all.  The tracks are too glossy and often don't even sound live, like \\"Sweet Surrender\\", \\"I Love You\\" and \\"Possession\\".  Hopefully Sarah's new \\"Afterglow Live\\" CD will be a better example of how radiant Sarah McLachlan is in concert.

B00005JNEI|5.0|It doesn't matter which side you are on, you need to see this movie.  Although the movie shows some serious problems with the Bush administration, there are many other interesting items in this film.  Whether you are a liberal or a conservative, you owe it to yourself to see this movie before Nov. 2nd.
B00005JLT5|5.0|This film may be well the sublime masterpiece of this gifted director .<br />The deep emotional impact and the introspective atmosphere of the movie allow us to watch the artist before the opression , the struggling presence of the Nazis in Poland and through the obstinate bars of the mercurial , epic and granitic Chopin Ballade No. 1 Op. 28  , Adrien Brody will built his own shield against the enemy .<br />But in the middle of this moral misery this fact will become the weird vehicle which links two refined souls . One of them is clear , but the another is seriously disturbed , between his internal wishes and the outside demands and imposed rules. This encounter will open an invisible gate for those men who will share far beyond his beliefs and points of view a warm and effective reason to forget though for brief moments the crude surrounding reality that involves them .<br />There is film dated from 1979 titled Roads in the night and casually directed by Krzystoff Zanussi, a polish filmmaker too in what we watch the clash culture between a Polish countess listening Chopin prelude op. 28 No. 15 best known as Teardrop and the curious impossible romance with a aristocratic nazi young officer due the obvious political obstacles .<br />As you see both films are close related but the Pianist differs from that one in its inner epic aspect .<br />The heart of the craft will never be under the war miseries , seems the prevailing statement of this excellent movie a real Cannes winner and much more received in Europe than America even it suffers of certain steadiness along its development .<br />Towering acting for Brody who won the Academy Award as best actor.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I stumbled across this CD wondering around Barnes & Nobles near my house.  What a find!  At first, I thought they had put out a new collection for Ella Fitzgerald.  Madeleine Peyroux's voice has that timeless quality that just breathes the music.  Lush with the old style, Madeleine sings the classics along with new stuff that just makes you want to lay back and enjoy your time.  Pick up this CD and play it when you need to relax or if you just want to chill.
0790734850|5.0|This extraordinary adaptation which illuminates as a few , the sordid atmosphere behind the opulence and gorgeousness of those fifties make of this work the masterpiece of Curtis Hanson.<br /><br />The script is deeply immersed in the best noir style and thanks to a perfect script with fine dialogues and a superb cast in which Kim Bassinger shines a radiant star in the best role of his career inspired for that neglected but unforgettable Veronica Lake.  There were two raising promising actors such Russell Crowe and Kevin  Spacey make a remarkable  role in one of the top ten films of the nineties in U.SA.
B00005JNEI|4.0|The title of Fahrenheit 9/11 uses the title of Ray Bradbury's science fiction novel where the firefighter's job is to burn books and Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature where paper begins to burns.  The activist and filmmaker Michael Moore happens to get in trouble with Bradbury as he used the title, but Moore used the title in respect of Bradbury.<br /><br />Fahrenheit 9/11 won the Golden Palm in Cannes 2004, which began a long road of controversy as Disney refused to release it, but later it was released by Lions Gate.  The Republican side of America loathes the film while Democrats admire the craftsmanship of Moore as it goes into lengthy detail to reveal President Bush's involvement with the Bin Laden's and the war in Iraq.  The controversy around the film brought more attention to the film as it helped the film break box office records as a documentary.<br /><br />The film focuses on President Bush as Michael Moore is displaying his view of the United States presidency through like minded people.  Moore does this with strong conviction as these people that he displays have become targets to the big presidential machine by ways which include tools such as the Patriot Act, decisions made in regards to the war in Iraq, and family's that have lost loved ones in the Iraq war.  The notion becomes evident as the film unfolds, that it is Moore's desire to oust the current president of United States of America because of his decisions.<br /><br />Whatever political affiliation the audience has all around the world Fahrenheit 9/11 will affect all viewers.  The personal experience of the film will either be positive or negative and this will heavily depend on socioeconomic background, upbringing, and beliefs of the audience.  Whatever the outcome, people should cherish and protect the freedom, without being persecuted in any way, that one has to make a film such as Fahrenheit 9/11, because in a society, e.g., Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, the film would have never been made.een made.  <br />
B000009HF2|4.0|This release seems to never get old.  I still consider this a great live album and I never seem to get tired of listening to it no matter how many times I also hear the songs on the radio.  I got to finally see Peter Frampton recently and I got to sit in the front row.  I was blown away.  Frampton, without the hair, put on a great show.  See my review also for Frampton, Live in Detroit.
B000059TPN|4.0|The Rock is an extraordinary action film with pure adrenaline pumping in its veins as lethal VX gas threatens to kill hundreds of thousand in the San Francisco bay area.  This will lead into a high speed nitroglycerine race against time where a group of highly trained marines led by Brigadier General Francis X. Hummel (Ed Harris) decides to turn into a terrorist.  Hummel invades Alcatraz and takes tourists' hostage as he plans to shoot rockets with lethal VX gas into the city of San Francisco, unless the United States answers his demands.  The United States answers by sending a group of Navy SEALS led by Commander Anderson (Michael Biehn) and two oddities, a geriatric ex-SAS operative and a tense chemist.<br /><br />The real weapons against the Hummel are the former SAS soldier, John Mason (Sean Connery), and the chemist, Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage).  Mason has been locked away in secret in a United States prison for the last three decades, one of these prisons used to be Alcatraz from which Mason also escaped.  Goodspeed is a laid-back chemist that works for the FBI's chemistry unit that has never been outside of a laboratory, which makes him more of a hazard than an asset as they enter the undergrounds of Alcatraz.<br /><br />Michael Bay brings the audience a film full of daunting stunts, explosions, and shoot outs.  The special effects are a big part of this carnival of sound and color which is tied together neatly with a decent story.  The story is well balanced with good actors and well developed characters.  For example, the evil Hummel is not just a bad guy as he also has a deeper moral value, which fuels his anger that drives him to this madness.  Goodspeed is obsessed about vinyl records and his wife just got pregnant.  These small character traits that are portrayed on the silver screen enhance the cinematic experience as it brings texture to the story, which offers humor, suspense, and drama.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road and Let It Be are undoubtedly the Beatles' crowning acheivements. This is one of the greatest albums of all time, and is truly one to own, even if you are just curious about the single most influential band of all time. <br /> <br />
B00005JMJG|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. If for nothing else watch this movie to see Jim Carey in a totally different element. We have seen him before in a few serious roles films such as Man on the Moon and The Majestic but this one trully shows what he can do as a great actor of not only comedy but a wide spectrum of genres.  <br /> <br />He is paired wonderfully with Kate Winslet as the free spireted moody girl who longs for someone to belong with. This is trully a heartwarming story  that makes one think if we went through the procedure described in the film, would we really be more happy? A lot of pain is described and even felt when the characters decide to undertake the procedure and i think that this is the movies strong point, that audiences relate to the characters profoundly. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00006879E|3.0|I think that your going to either love or hate Maroon5. If you like their singles I suggest you ask a friend to borrow the cd and see for yourself if it's worth buying. I don't think they are trying to be a boyband, however, Adam Levine's voice is scarely similair to Justin Timberlake's in a few songs. The music on this cd are not NEW as some people keep suggesting, they are just mixed with older music. <br /> <br />The differences between the singles are not like that on the cd. There are about 4 songs that sound the same, but with a few chords changed - luckily they are good songs. If you like bluesy music with a little bit of classic rock then you will probably enjoy. If your just looking for something fresh, check out Maroon5. The CD is decent and Adam is very good vocalist.
B00005A46T|5.0|This is Metal! Good Heavy METAL!!! All the songs on this Album are great! I don't have a favorite theyre all my favorite! because they all rock. Ok My favorite would probably be Disasterpiece or I am Hated. Those are awesome songs! I was watching my Disasterpieces DVD and i saw that Jim and Mick(the guitarists) were not playing their chords. I dont know maybe they were but, i dont know? This album rocks either way!!!!!!!!
B000002V07|5.0|My favorite Mazzy Star album, for reasons not completely clear.  Or are they?  Clarity, after all, is the quality that Mazzy Star achieved on their sophmore effort to an extent not quite found on their other two albums.  Clarity of production sound, as compared to the fuzzier debut 'She Hangs Brightyly', but more importantly, clarity of song construction.  It's a bit tricky to pick up on, but what you're listening to as this remarkable group drones along, like the soundtrack of a swinging wristwatch, is a batch of songs both brilliantly conceived and recorded.   <br /> <br />Don't believe me?  Well, if you got a little too used to hearing the opener 'Fade Into You' - which unfortunately became a sort of '90s cliche - then do yourself a favor and listen with a bit more intent next time.  And speaking of time, wait until you have a proper 45 minutes of distraction-free listening set aside to do it.  Dave Roback's guitar parts are so easy to fall for, and as you know by now Hope Sandoval's voice is sweet as maple syrup.  Did she have occasion to act a bitch onstage?  Well, yes. I was witness to it myself.  But I like to think she just took the music seriously is all, and I could never in my life fault someone for that.  Oh, and to the guy before me who is sadly mired in the '70s and pining for his Lou Reed, time to move on, bro.   <br /> <br />And lest you think that because the neighbors aren't banging on the walls means this is music to fall asleep to, well, wake up and pay some attention.  You'll be glad you did.  The final three tracks, shifting from psychadelia to tender classical and back, are enough to leave me in a cold sweat.  And that trio is but the conclusion to what I call a brilliant little record from a band that I wish woulda never broken up.  RIP, Mazzy Star.
B0006213WG|5.0|This CD was a little different than their other CD's but i dont care. The cd starts out with a short intro which kinda shows you that they have talent(which they do!)my favorite tracks are No Reason, We're All To Blame, The Bitter End(which has 2 guitar solo's!), I'm Not The One, and 88. The Others were definetly good but these are my favorites and the hardest on the whole CD. There are over 5 guitar solos and theyre trying 2 show people that they do have talent and they do. Pick this CD up if your a Sum fan or just a fan good Hard Rock music. There is only 1 or 2 punk rock songs. I think it's only 1 though. some of the songs sound like they were off of \\"Does this Look Infected\\" but that's ok if you liked the songs off of that record because I did. I hope that you like the record if you pick it up or order it because it's a good CD!
B00005221M|5.0|This is a great movie, based on the book by James Fenimore Cooper. It's set in 1757, when the English and French were engaged in war to control North America. The movie doesn't follow the book too closely, which is good. Anyone who's had the patience to read Cooper's book knows that you wouldn't want to sit through an exact movie adaptation. <br /> <br />Michael Mann (the director) has an excellent sense of visual style, and the movie is very easy on the eyes. The camera work is magnificent. Of course, the subject matter helps. Wonderful scenery (filmed in the Smoky Mountains in NC) with misty forests and hills, soft light trickling through the leaves, the night lit by cannon and mortar fire, soldiers in colorful period costumes, camera angles framed as if for picture postcards. Not to mention the photogenic Madeleine Stowe, Daniel Day-Lewis and Jodhi May. Everything in this movie is a visual delight. <br /> <br />The soundtrack is excellent, but make sure you get the DTS version of this DVD. The music is mostly Irish, pleasant and neutral. It's the sort of music that enhances the story without intruding. I'm glad they removed the song \\"I will find you\\" in this Director's Cut. There's no place for modern Celtic music in a movie set in 1757. The mortars make very satisfying explosions during the siege of the fort, if you pipe the DTS soundtrack through a sufficiently powerful amplifier. <br /> <br />Daniel Day-Lewis is one of my favorite actors, though I wouldn't initially have thought that this was the role for him. It's too light and trivial. But he carries it off with suitable intensity. The story is basically a romance between Hawkeye (Day-Lewis) and Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe), the daughter of a British Colonel. Unfortunately, the Director's Cut deletes some scenes between Hawkeye and Cora, which were there in the original VHS edition. This is a shame, because there is so little dialog in this film anyway. It wouldn't have hurt to develop the romance a little.<br /> <br />This is not intellectual entertainment, but it is a beautiful, romantic movie, well worth seeing.
B00007BHOE|5.0|First off, this DVD is amazing and awesome!I loved every second of this DVD and the show was awesome! I recommend this to every Slipknot fan because it's completly awesome! every song was great!and i do agree that mick's guitar was not loud enough! but i could still hear it and joey's drum solo was really cool!Corey really cursed a lot though but, who cares?! and yes i hate the clown because he's disgusting, jackin off his mic! he's weird but the rest is just pure awesome! go and get it     now!!! <br />        By the way the unreleased song \\"Purity\\" f-ing rocks!!!
B0002SA51O|5.0|I have been a obsessed fan of this series since its beginnings on Showtime. The show has a great imagination and strange but hilarious sense of humor. I recommend this to any sci-fi fan and fan of the original movie to watch! I am watching most of the dvd's to pass the time until the second half od season eight starts up again in January!
1591840562|5.0|The book makes a big promise with its sub-title, \\"The Time-Tested, Battle-Hardened Guide for Anyone Starting Anything.\\"  I wondered if such a book could live up to it. \\"Starting anything\\" refers to a business, not a career, school, or hobby.<br /><br />Obviously, it's impossible to create a comprehensive book of business best practices because every business has its own variables. What works great for one may kill another. However, the book doesn't take that approach. Rather, it tells how it is starting a business and the rough road of dealing with VCs (venture capitalists). If you expect a positive spin on stuff that's hard to do. Read a fairy tale instead.<br /><br />Rather than abrasiveness and a \\"do this, don't do this\\" attitude, Kawasaki uses humor to explain the process. Anyone who has a small business including those around for a few years will benefit. When ready to take action, use this book as the manual that doesn't come with starting a business. Thinking about it isn't going to make a business successful.<br /><br />Every chapter begins with the GIST of it, an overview of what's to come. Each ends with FAQ, frequently AVOIDED questions, to review the chapter's content and drill it in deeper for better understanding and implementation.<br /><br />Get simple, but important hints on everyday business practices such as how to give a strong presentation. How many times have you sat through a presentation where each slide has over 20 words in size 12 point and the presenter practically reads the words adding little to what is on the slide? Kawasaki smartly covers the 10-20-30 rule. 10 slides, 20 minutes, and size 30 font. Making changes to the small practices can lead to reaching the next milestone.<br /><br />This book can be likened to a quick reference guide for starting a business and useful strategies: has just what is needed without heavy-duty or dry language. It is, however, larger than most quick guides, but a fast and easy read into the world of startups and dealing with VCs. If a VC isn't involved, the book provides valuable tools and ideas to help with any business. However, technology start ups seeking VCs will benefit most.<br /><br />Stuck on a business plan? Learn what is needed and not needed. Don't waste valuable time and use the book to do what's necessary without going overboard.<br /><br />If long hours and challenges aren't in the plans, then read a romanticized business book instead. The Art of the Start shows how it really is and it's hard, but it can be a little easier with this book as a guide.<br /><br />Get a taste of the book by reading its manifesto ([...] a free PDF download.

B00005JNEI|5.0|This film was entertaining and disturbing.  Disturbing to know what really goes on behind the doors of the Bush family.  And utterly disturbing since they are running our country.  How could anyone vote for George W and the Bush monster machine, unless they were profiting from their greed ??
B0001EFTVA|5.0|another great anime film from the genius who gave us perfect blue and millennium actress,satoshi kon. <br />this time around he offers us a comedy about three homless characters. an ex shop owner ,a drag queen and arunaway teenager, who stumble upon an abandoned infant in christmas eve,and decide to look for the baby's mother .and since it's christmas ,we're treated with a hilarious amount of miracles,that do get a little too much near the end, but satoshi kon manages to put it back in balance ,when he introduces the mother .and it's all  served with kon's famous striking visuals and breathtaking action. <br /> <br />too bad there is no dubbed version of the film in this dvd.readind subtitles ,with no background knowledge of the language it's translating ,takes out some of the fun of watching a film .the original version is definitely great,but dubbing lets us enjoy the visuals a little bit more. <br /> <br />oh,and there is a reprinting of an original character illustration by satoshi kon of miuki,signed and dated ,exclusively for this dvd.  <br /> <br />
B00005J6UR|4.0|When I first saw this movie I was around 6 or 7 and I just loved it.  Some parts could be considered scary, I found it thrilling more then anything else.  It is still extremely funny and heartwarming.  Besides Magwai's are just so darn cute, how can you not love them at first sight.
B0002ZMITY|2.0|Ali G is one of the great characters created by Sacha Baron Cohen that is the star of HBO's series, Da Ali G Show.  The series on HBO is spectacular, as Cohen feeds on the Andy Kaufman style of comedy, walking the line between comedy and downright irritation.  Discussing intellectual subjects with experts, Cohen plays Ali G as an ignorant and poorly spoken talk show host, always putting his guests in awkward spots of conversation.  It's brilliant and hilarious to watch, I have not missed an episode yet. <br />That said, this movie is a travesty, and should be skipped by anyone who truly appreciates Cohen's gift.  His style of comedy is best presented in a live situation with off-the-cuff comments and queries.  In this movie, the humor is almost too forced, it lacks spontenaity and more often than not falls into cliched humor and tired jokes.  The plot is not only weak but super predictable.  I do give this two stars instead of one, as there are 3 or 4 jokes that actually did make me laugh.  However, as a whole, this movie was a serious waste of time and an insult to the true genius of Cohen.
B00007BHOE|5.0|If there are any aspiring Music Producers out there take a look at this DVD and regardless of whether u like slipknot or not this how a live concert DVD should be made. The music quality is superb the live show is excellent and well filmed and the intensity of the band throughout the entire gig is superlative. Must Have
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller team up in this comedy that makes fun of superficiality, fame, fortune, and ego.  The first time through, I must admit, I found it mildly funny, but was not impressed.  However, each time I watch it, it gets funnier and funnier.  From Derek Zoolander's trademark \\"looks\\" to Zoolander and Hansel pounding on a computer like monkeys from Kubrick's 2001, it is hysterical comedy from start to finish.  Will Ferrel is spectacular as the villian, wearing what may be the funkiest hairdo in cinematic history.  Wilson and Stiller prove that they are one of the best comedic teams of the last quarter century, their chemistry oozes from the screen.
B00005K3O4|5.0|I was researching on the computer two months ago and found out the chiodo emails so I said\\"what the hell\\"and I contacted them. <br /> <br />The sequel is about a nasa space ship being shot down out of outer space then these clowns(klowns)land in none other but Cresent Cove.They have come for three reasons. <br />1)To get more Cotton Candy Blood Juice <br />2)To seek revenge on the ones that defeated them the last time they landed. <br />3)To save(rescue)the little buddle of joy they left  behind. <br /> <br />Big Red,Little Greeny,Mr.Funkiller,Mr.Cool,Macho Klown,Yellow Mellow Shooter all return.(They took off in another ship.The other was like a decoy to distract the humans.) <br /> <br />And no Klownzilla is not the leader.Big Red is.Do ya'll really think that thing could possibly lead that group of misfits?I don't think so. <br /> <br />I got this information from the Chiodo Brothers themselves in an email.I still have the email too. <br />Hope this helps.
B0001O3YD0|4.0|Several characteristics of this film contribute to it being labeled as a B movie.  Yes, the plot is rather stale and \\"done,\\" the characters are very cookie cutter, and there is little character development.  If one knows those aspects going in, then this is a fun way to spend a couple of hours. <br />What really blew me away about this film was the direction itself.  Through most of the movie, the creatures that pursue the characters are not seen, or only unidentifiable glimpses, actually making them scarier through the mystery of the unknown.  My favorite aspect, though, was the color saturation that David Twohy used throughout the film.  Obviously he shot the scenes in regular earth landscapes.  In the editing, he saturated the scenes with color.  For instance, when the characters first walk across the landscape of a foreign world, the whole image is almost a fluorescent gold, successfully giving the feel of another planet.  The colors are always very vibrant and rich, sweet candy for the eye.  Twohy definitely has a future.
068987474X|1.0|I am a male licensed psychologist who works mostly with couples. This book is the worst kind of trash to play on the emotions of all of us who want to find that special person, and to find a simple answer to the complexities of dating. It seems to be a clever ploy and get-rich scheme from two writers of the tv series \\"Sex and the City.\\" (this qualifies them as experts? Life is NOT a tv series). Stop and think before you uncritically accept ideas in the mindless flow from the media! The most aggressive guys are the best guys, huh?-come on ladies! This is of the most fundamental mistakes a woman can make and is often the entry into an abusive or controlling relationship. The scenarios in the book seem tongue in cheek, even comical-sad to say it seems it is being taken seriously. The authors must be amazed! A man could easily get sued or lose his job or be accused of harassment if he followed the suggestions of the authors. It sets up also a \\"damned if he does, damned if he doesn't\\" scenario for men. The man is not agressive enough-but wait, he might also be an insensitive brute the next minute. Many of the reasons in the scenarios why the men do not become more aggressive are quite legitimate, and suggest that he may considerate and sensitive-not a wimp!. The men who come-on very fast and aggressive may be exciting at first-but are often \\"players,\\" and wear very thin in a long-term relationship (\\"Why can't my guy express feelings and communicate?\\") Perhaps the authors of this book can provide a stupid sequel to this book with silly ideas to solve THOSE problems! The ideas in the book are very counter-productive and will only feed into mistrust and anger between the genders. Don't buy this book-toss it if you did! <br /> <br />
B0002VL0KQ|4.0|Celine Has Released A Wonderful Album For Anyone Who Has Or Loves Children!! Celine & David Foster Have Teamed Up Again With Great Results!! The Title Song Id Terrific As Are \\"Beautiful Boy\\", \\"What A Wonderful World\\", \\"Baby Close Your Eyes\\" & \\"In Some Small Way\\". The Photos Are Gorgeous!!!!! I Will Be Buying All The Versions & The Calendar!!! Celine Sounds Great & Looks Happy!!! Another Great Cd From Celine!!!!
B0001HAHXW|4.0|The cover photo for an album/cd usually is designed to signal something to the potential buyer... and for this one Clapton apparently decided to costume himself as a successful university professor.  Although this cd does come off as a bit staid... I intend no criticism by saying that Clapton's musical approach here is perfectly scholarly and respectful.<br /><br />For those who prefer a fiery approach to guitar Blues music, I can do no better than recommend \\"Unplugged\\" [Sep 1994], the compilation \\"Blues\\" [Jul 1999], or the teenaged Eric Clapton guitar break-out extravaganza, \\"Bluesbreakers\\", which was digitally remastered and re-released in June 2001.
B000068TSI|5.0|This is possibly the best war movie I've seen.  It was honest, objective toward all sides, and reverent towards the men it portrays.  I served eight years in the Army, and though I never was sent into combat, the bond that exists between guys in uniform, regardless of whether or not you know them, is what make this both the hardest and the greatest film I've seen.  I held it together pretty well until it ended, when the names of the fallen were shown.  Couldn't hold it in after that.  This one really hits you in the gut. <br />There's also some great humorous stuff that keeps the film from being morbid.  You come to love these guys, and then your heart breaks wide open when the fall. <br />Top notch film.  My hat is off to Mel Gibson. <br />Jim from Ohio
B00063MBU8|2.0|Most of the songs on this album sound very very similar.  These guys take no chances.  Everything is just ok.  They need to try something new instead of just puking out the same song over and over again.
B000002LEU|5.0|Love it.  Absolutely, this is an exceptional CD.  I will say since I recovered this band from my memories I have had a skip in my step.  It is sorta gloomy, but I like gloomy.  Gloomy can be quite liberating sometimes. <br /> <br />This was New Wave before glam entered the picture. It's murky nature is its beauty.  Let's liken it to a swamp, pretty but stinky.   <br /> <br />
B00007G207|5.0|I'm not the first or last to write that this film is very manipulative in pushing the audiences emotional buttons....but very rarely does a film give you prolongued emotional highs that capture your imagination and draw you into the film. This is a personal favourite of mine, as it is one of the rare films that I don't mind being emotionally manipulated because it has such a good story that resinates with everyone who's had a childhood memory and a longing to go back to that place that has long since disappeared. The story follows Salvatore (Toto) a young kid living in a small village in Italy and his adventures and happy times that revolve around the local cinema run by Alfredo who would be his friend and mentor as he grows. The years follow with Toto leaving his small village to find his way in life, but memories follow him of his home and what he left behind, including his first love. I won't spoil the story by giving much more away, but you will enjoy this film, includig the moving music soundtrack.
B00003CWL6|5.0|They have given us everything in American Beauty.  The visuals and music are a driving force.  I loved the storyline, which holds you captive.  Benning and Spacey are perfect in their \\"un-chemistry.\\"  I get the feeling they loathe each other's every breath. <br /> <br />Can't think of a single thing I didn't like about this movie.   <br /> <br />Why haven't you watched this movie yet?
B00005MP58|5.0|My favorite thing to do on a rainy weekend is curl up on the couch and transport myself to Jane Austen's world.  <br /> <br />This particular adaptation of Pride and Predjudice has excellent costumes, beautiful set decorations and supurb casting. Colin Firth *is* Mr. Darcy as far as I'm concerned. The movie is faithful enough to the book for even the most die-hard Austen fan. The parts of Mrs. Bennett and Lydia are so well acted you can feel the embarrassment of Lizzie at her mother and sister's perpetual bad behavior. <br /> <br />I love this movie. I do have to agree with other reviewers that the film quality seems a bit poor for a special edition, but it definately doesn't detract at all from this wonderful movie. <br />
B000063DI9|3.0|When \\"Seventh Son\\" first came out I hated it. I felt that the band put the \\"concept\\" before the music, the guitar-synth heavy tunes were the polar opposite of songs found on \\"Powerslave\\", \\"Number of the Beast\\" and \\"Killers\\". But, occasionally I would pull the cd back out and with time I came to appreciate what Iron Maiden was doing with \\"Seventh Son\\" and several of the songs on the disk are pretty good. The title track is my favorite, it has that epic sound Maiden made famous with tunes like \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\". \\"Only the Good Die Young\\", \\"The Evil That Men Do\\" and \\"The Prophecy\\", though very heavily laden with guitar-synth, are still recognizable as Iron Maiden. Judging by other reviews you either love this album, or hate it. And though I enjoy this cd now, I wouldn't recommend \\"Seventh Son\\" as the first Maiden disk to start your collection, I would pick this up only after you have become a fan of the band through their other albums first.
1400032717|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a Special Education teacher. At first glance, I thought the premise seemed contrived, however once I began reading the book I was hooked. In fact it was so compelling that one day I sat in my car during my lunch break to be able to read in peace during summer weather in Texas. <br /> <br />Haddon does a great job at showing us the struggle Christopher goes through to gain insight into the situation around him, while at the same time trying very hard to stay within the limits he has set for himself to keep his world orderly.  <br /> <br />This is a very well rounded story in all regards. The characters are expertly developed and the plot is excellent. The book is well written, with many creative touches. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful book for high schoolers, teachers or parents to gain an understanding of what *might* be going on in the heads of special needs children.
0688145078|5.0|I bought this book for my stepson while I was still pregnant.  I was worried he would become jealous once the baby was born.  He was three at the time and loved this book.  It really helped him understand that babies aren't capable of doing the things he does, which he was having a hard time grasping.  He couldn't wait to \\"play baseball and build blocks as soon as his baby brother came out\\" of my belly. I did have to make minor changes while reading the story because it is written with \\"Mommy & Daddy\\" but that wasn't a big deal.  He's now 4 and my son is 5 months and this book remains one of his favorites.  He always wants to \\"help give baby the bottle just like the GREAT big brother in the book to be the BEST big brother in the whole world\\"!  It also lets siblings know that they are just as special and loved as the \\"new\\" baby is.  God Bless!
B00031TXBI|5.0|first of all, get a yellow marker or crayon, then draw in 5 more stars next to the 5 I already provided. I turn my back for a minute and John releases yet another brilliant solo album. Inside of Emptiness is by far the best CD of the series so far. John turns the rock way up in these songs. His guitar playing and singing have gotten better and better. The recording is intentionally simplistic and rough sounding, but after a few listens, you don't care. The music just takes over and you forget. I can't come up with words to describe thse songs. \\"Look In\\" has all the makings of the 70's classic rock sounds. Complete with a long KILLER guitar solo!  Some bands take 2-3 years to release an album only to have it be a let down. John releases 6 solo CD's in 6 months and they all deliver. This guy never let's us down.
B00006RU5B|5.0|what an amazingly awesome cd.  blends some hard rock with some soft ballads that seem to fit perfectly with each other.  its very rare to have a band like this who didn't even play a single show before recording their album.  chris cornell is one of my favorite singers, soundgarden was one of my favorite bands, and the same with the boys from rage.  i was really interested in seeing the changes these musicians would have to make.  it would of seemed like they needed work to get used to each, but not exactly.  they seemed more used to each other then any other band who gets together after having success with another group.  velvet revolver looked like they wanted to jump the bandwagon, but i'll be the first to say that velvet revolver flat out sux ASS!!! i love the stone temple pilots but that little idea just did not seem to work out, not like audioslave anyway. to sum up audioslave=GREAT BAND!!!
B00007JVBI|3.0|I think this is a good record, but after a classic such as 'Moon Pix' the bar is set kinda high, and the songs on this one don't grab me nearly as much. You'll have to listen to these yourself and make up your own mind, but if you have to pick a Cat Power record, get 'Moon Pix' first.
B000286S8S|5.0|i bought this cd the day it came out...i was so thrilled to get home and listen to it.  i must say that there are a load of kick ass songs that blow the \\"best of\\" volume one right outta the window...which i also have.  the only bad thing is that yeah, i agree that both singers should have had their own disk.  but not even one cut from gary cherone was even on it.  they could have at least put one song from van halen 3 on as a bonus track if nothin else.  the 3 live trakcs are from the live: right here right now cd.  they could have not put those on since they were already on the cd to start out with, and put without you, from afar, and once on.  and now let me say that human's being isn't on the cd.  human's being is an amazing song.  the guitar work in it is just awesome!!!  and as far as sammy vs. dave, sammy reigns supreme...i love the \\"david lee roth\\" era, but i think the \\"sammy hagar\\" era was way better...he seems to fit in better into what van halen represents then good ole diamond dave anyway...
B00004XONN|4.0|After touring their internationally acclaimed album OK Computer, Radiohead retreated back into the studio and stayed quiet for almost four years.  <br /> <br />What they did was start from scratch and work their way out of the creative block that OK Computer's massive success had unwittingly set up for them. Every member of the band learned to play new instruments and experiment with different sounds, bleeps and bloops, and the result of all this was Kid A. Many people, diehard Radiohead fans included, have a hard time appreciating the sudden shift in style, as Radiohead suddenly no longer sound like a rock band. <br /> <br />This record is definitely not recommended for newcomers, as it takes more than several plays for the genius of each song to dawn on its listener. But after many listens I realized that this is possibly one of the most beautiful albums I have ever heard. Most of the songs are subtle, slow melodies that are dark, dense and at first difficult to get into but reveal themselves to be intricate and profound beneath the textures of guitar, keyboards, eerie synthesizers, oddly syncopated drum loops, and some sounds whose origins I still have yet to discover. Thom Yorke's lyrics are amazing as always, not quite providing a flat, 2D message but rather building a colorful description around it. Yorke's voice seems to melt in and disappear within the soft, tuneful melodies, which was intended as he prefers to use his voice as an instrument rather than dominate the track. <br /> <br />In general, it's an astonishingly beautiful record, but not recommended if your tastes tend to learn toward Radiohead's more anthemic guitar rock. Because this is nothing of the sort. This is better.
B0002SROSQ|5.0|Nick Cave seems to have experienced an epiphany, drawing on gospel, rhythm and blues and earthy blues to piece together what is perhaps the most emotionally satisfying collection of his career.  For those who are used to the preternatural scowling Nick Cave, this CD may be a disappointment.  Why, Nick Cave almost sounds joyous!  Yet, the haunting refrains still lurk beneath the surface which is what makes this 2 CD set so memorable.
B0000013G9|5.0|i love this cd its all that plus some more its tight! i mean i dont know what else to say i love this whole cd! you know and my girl lefteye shines on this cd as well as t-boz and chilli. RIP LEFTEYE. this is the cd to have to your collection! (all tlc cd's ) but this too <br />
B00005JL9B|5.0|Battle Royale <br />directed by Kinji Fukasaku <br />2000, 114 mins. <br /> <br />Damn kids these days. Won't listen, no sir. Don't go to school anymore. Fieldtrips, though. Definitely. <br /> <br />Place: a remote island. More specifically: some dark room on that very island. Filled with a bunch of damn kids. And soldiers, and Kitano. Yup, our favorite Japanese actor/director/poker-face 'Beat' Takashi Kitano. He introduces the students, nay, 'students' (hell, if you don't go to school, you're no student either) to our favorite game: Battle Royale. By now, we have all heard about it, yes, we all know what Battle Royale is, but the kids are, of course, clueless. However, the rules are quickly explained (including a more than delightful instruction video) and well, let the games begin. The kids are supposed to kill eachother, and only one can remain when 72 hours have passed. <br /> <br />This is of course a great story for a movie (or manga, or, initially, book), and, glad to say this, Battle Royale delivers. The acting is more than just mediocre (Kitano is great; the 'I'm-dying-hold-me-while-I-say-my-last-words' scenes are laughable though), the action is superior. Some good plot twists add to the good feeling the movie gives you, and with a nice ending it definitely satisfies. Add to that Chiaki Kuriyama, Aki Maeda, and Kou Shibasaki, and you know you gotta watch this.  <br /> <br />As for the gore, this movie doesn't totally let you down. Although not tremendously graphic and explicit, there's some nice and brutal scenes in there. Scary? Not at all, but that's not the point. Battle Royale is an extreme adrenaline rush, which really must be experienced. Although it hasn't officialy been released in the US, one should really try to get his hands on a copy (import or something): don't miss it. <br /> <br />mos says: <br /> <br />Scares? 1/10 <br />Gore? 5/10 (it's there, but it's not so explicit at times) <br />Number of cute Japanese schoolgirls? A nice collection/10 <br />Fun factor? 11/10 <br />Chiaki Kuriyama in a yellow training suit? 10/10
B00009V7T2|5.0|Truley and utterly amazing.  Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and Cedric Bixler Zavala are nothing short of pure genious's.  This album has to be one of the best albums I ever purchased.  I had listened to At The Drive-In slightly, and had been a huge fan of Sparta.  One day while looking around online I had come to find out that At The Drive-In had split and 3 of the members had formed Sparta while the other 2 members(Cedric and Omar) had gone on to form The Mars Volta.  I decided that if they were anything like Sparta or ATDI then they had to be good.  I was blown away once i bought the cd and listened to it.  I was hooked I havent heard anything this good in a long, its rivals and in my personal opinion blows away Pink Floyds \\"The Wall\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\"  Also if you get a chance pick up the lyric book which is available at [...] its a meaning behind the album.  BUY THIS CD! Its the best music i have ever heard
B0001KZM3O|4.0|ok from my point to view this is kind of an album that one will like a lot or hate it. I am hardcore Floydian and i love them all from syd to wright. this album basicly shows Rogers character, you can tell that he very much so opposes war and tries to cinicaly critisze WWII leaders. in this album he gets pretty personal i say, it shows how deep his wound is \\"loss f his father to war\\". I personally love it. but it not your typical Pink FLoyd.Whatsoever.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I've listened to this album when I did homework, when I slept on the bus, and when I had nothing else to do... <br />and I think it warped my brain. <br /> <br />Noramally, I would not like this CD, but it is so ingrained in my head when I listen to the music I can feel it flow throughout my entire body and fill me with strength/energy. <br /> <br />And for all the idiots that say this album \\"suck\\" or that \\"Metallica is better,\\" you're wrong (just listen to it a few more times).
B00005JNEI|4.0|Farenheit 9/11 is an extremely educational film about the actions of George W. Bush during his presidency. Most of the material in this film is very truthful (the Iraq war, George Bush's entanglement with the Saudi Arabian government, among other things), and yet some material is false and i thought didnt need to be included in the film. Also, there is the funny and sarcastic material that had falling out of my seat. <br />I was deeply disturbed by a few scenes in this movie (particularly the scene of Baghdad's citzen's being slaughtered by the american forces, the scenes which showed the desecration of those two american bodies) and a few were just kind of stupid (the interview of the woman who lost her son, who was aboard the black hawks that went down), and a few were very insightful, which revealed things i never knew about the Iraq war and the actions of George W Bush. <br />Anyway, I think this movie is a must-see for everyone.
B00005ATQH|3.0|Stanley Kubrick is my all-time favorite director.  Even with his less well regarded later works I have always found something to redeem them.  \\"Lolita\\" is another story.  I could care less if I never see this film again.  It's nothing inherent in the production of this film.  The movies tag-line asks the question,\\"Who would want to make a film of \\"Lolita?\\"  That begs the question, \\"Why would anyone want to make a film of \\"Lolita?\\" I found the film's source material, the novel by Vladimir Nabokov, to be perverse.  Even with the restrictions laid down by the production code in 1962 this film still seems tawdry.  I feel like I need a shower after watching it.  That is not to dismiss the technical attributes of the film. Kubrick is still a master storyteller.  Nor, the work of the main actors,James Mason, Peter Sellers, Shelley Winters, and Sue Lyon.  It's just that so much enterprise was put into a project with so much talent and it just wasn't worth the effort.
B00008G68W|5.0|This is indeed one of the movies on the top of my list... While some historical liberties are taken, in order to make it dramatically appealing (i.e., contrary to common belief, Columbus' ideas were not rejected out of ignorance, but because his academic audiences knew all too well that Asia could not be as close on the West as Columbus claimed it would be), the movie is, as a whole, quite an achievement... The scene when they discover land at the end of the first trip is, in my opinion, one of the greatest achievements in cinematography... Acting is fairly good across the board, and Gerard Depardieu plays a good Columbus, with a good resemblance, if one is to believe ancient portraits... <br /> <br />Vangelis' soundtrack is one of the finest in the history of cinema... In one track, an indian voice is slowly overtaken by a western choir, a sad metaphor of events to come... <br /> <br />By the way, note to the writer below, who wants to get his facts straight: indeed, the region the other writer was referring to is  Catalonia (in Catalan), Cataluna/Catalu~a in Castillian)... No, Columbus was probably not Catalan, although it has been one of his suggested regions of origin...
B000002UAX|5.0|It's not my business to write crap about people who dislike this album. At the end of the day, it is purely subjective. Just because someone likes 50 Cent and hates the Beatles doesn't mean that they are mentally retarded or evil. They just have a different taste. Also, just because rolling stone and VH1 say that this one of the ten best albums ever does not mean it is. VH1 have claimed in their polls that Nelson Mandela is a pop culture icon, that Robbie Williams is the greatest artist of all time and that Bohemian Rhapsody is the greatest song of all time (the beatles were not featured in the greatest song poll). Rolling Stone called Led Zeppelin crap (and now says that they were amazing), trashed the Layla album (and now claim it as seminal), and lost touch with the music scene in the late seventies. (admittedly they are better than NME, who say that the Stone Roses debut is the best album of all time). Anyway, on to my review. <br /> <br />I love this album, though i hated it at first. To be honest i didn't like the beatles much at first. I preferred Metallica, Zeppelin, the Smiths. But, i had this album that a friend had given to me, cos i liked the song While my guitar for the solo. When i actually listened to it, i began to appreciate it. The songwriting is quite sophisticated, more than you think at first listen. But i didn't love it immediately. The more i listened though, the more i liked it. At first i loved side one and hated side two, now i think that side two is a little stronger. I don't think that this album is the 'greatest'. there are probably better albums. but this album had an impact, and influenced popular music, albeit not as much as Revolver. This is a very musical album, and can be a little hard to take. If you don't know the beatles, start with something different as this can easily put you off. I can see why some people hate the beatles because of this album. However, I personally think you should give it a go. It's my favourite album now,though that wasn't true when i was sixteen, as i liked Hail to the thief cos it was new. <br /> <br />Anyway, give it a go. you may well like it, and if you don't, you can return it or something.

B0002GTWYW|5.0|Biggie was one of the greatest rappers ever. This album proves it. Great track after great track. \\"The What\\" is the best song I have ever heard. Truly Meth and Big at their finest. Recommended to all hip-hop fans.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The Extended edition of each movie is a lot better than the original one.  Many questions that the original films left are answered in the extended ones.

B000002WPI|5.0|I must regret that I have yet to buy this album, but I have downloaded all but four songs from it. All the songs I have downloaded are among the tightests songs I have on my computer and I have over 600. The Wu always make good music but the stuff from this is the best, especially \\"C.R.E.A.M.\\" and \\"Ain't nothing to F' With.\\"

B0002MB7QW|4.0|I saw a nature show once about the effects of fresh water on salt water temperatures and currents, and was fascinated. This film portrays the climatic results in grand fashion. The survival situations are more fantasy driven- which makes this a very good moving picture.
B0000027I6|5.0|I hated this album when I first listened to it.<BR>I bought it with Waters' other two albums, The Pros And Cons Of Hitch Hiking and Radio K.A.O.S. and thoroughly enjoyed each of them separately just before I went to bed across two nights. I listened to them in order, which got me ATD last. Well, I didn't really like any song on the album with the exception of The Bravery Of Being Out Of Range. I thought it was boring, and confusing, and really droll. <BR>Guess what? Amused To Death is now my favourite album.<BR>I have every single recording Pink Floyd ever put out, and this tops them all, including the five-star stretch between The Dark Side Of The Moon and The Final Cut. It grew on me slowly as I listened to it over and over, 'giving it a chance' as all the reviewers on this site who liked it tell you to do. And it was SO worth it. Ever have a song that resonates with you musically and lyrically so much that when you sing along to it you can't help but grin and you get that feeling that you can't even sing anymore? Most of this album ends up doing that to you. It's not just that Waters' lyrics are among the best ever written, although they are; the music is actually excellent too. The album's weak point is right where it should be, in the middle, with three 'meh' songs that aren't too bad either. The other ELEVEN tracks are PERFECT. I mean, they're SPOTLESS. <br />1. The Ballad of Bill Hubbard - very moody, Floydish atmospheric music is the background to a World War veteran's tragic story. Sets the mood perfectly.<BR>2. What God Wants Part One - Catchy to a fault, and so easy to sing along with, this is Roger's newest anthem and is every bit as good as Another Brick In The Wall. Ironic lyrics about how 'God' is used as an excuse by...well, everyone.<BR>3,4. Perfect Sense Parts One and Two - The lyrics of the first part take a bit of decoding, but you'll get it eventually. And the second part will ring in your head for months. A sarcastic and ironic man explaining what he finally understands - the media's message and its connection to televised war.<BR>5. The Bravery Of Being Out Of Range - ROCKS. Pounding drums and roaring guitars and Roger's angry voice make this the one truly full-fledged rock tune on the album. Nothing has ever been more fun to sing along with than \\"Does the recoil remind you...remind you of SEX old man what the hell you gonna kill next?\\"<BR>6,7. Late Home Tonight Parts One and Two - Okay, this is the slow part. Lyrically heavy, musically light, a little on the boring side. The segue between them is great. The songs are likeable but don't compare to the rest.<BR>8. Too Much Rope - Not bad either, but easily the worst track on the album. This is the right spot for the bad songs, though - after the perfect intro and before the roaring crescendo at the end. Bob Ezrin gets picked on.<BR>9. What Gods Wants Part Two - A reprise of the first track, with every bit of the angry irony. Excellent track. The chanting televangelist at the beginning is eerie.<BR>10. What God Wants Part Three - Could be the best song on the album. The ending gives the sense of everything coming to a frantic head and spinning out of control. Brilliant.<BR>11. Watching TV - A good song, a nice acoustic bit with Eagle Don Henley co-singing the words. The verse about China is irritating but the song itself is good. The ENDING is great, as it sums up the point and startles you.<BR>12. Three Wishes - The chorus is what makes this song. The verses are good but the chorus makes me sing along every time.<BR>13. It's A Miracle - A miracle of a downer. This is the most sarcastic song around, calling the accomplishments of mankind a 'miracle' when they just exported Western culture everywhere else. End verse is hilarious.<BR>14. Amused To Death - Well worth the wait. This song is perfect - it starts off with a whimsical lament that suddenly turns into a roaring foretelling of the end of the human race, 'grouped 'round the TV sets'. The sheer RHYTHMof the segue between the song's two parts is catchy as hell. \\"And the childen on Mount Rose strut their stuff/Is absolute zero, cold enough.\\" And Roger's final screamed lyric says it all.<br />This album is an example of what happens when one man with a vision is allowed to explore it without anyone else's wishes getting in the way. Far superior to the Floydian offering two years later, The Division Bell, Amused To Death is Waters at his best, and the whole damn thing deserves a place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. <br />I LOVE THIS ALBUM.
B00007E8V4|1.0|Ok Here s how the story goes.The day was March 28 1995 five guys ...Mike Patton,Jim Martin,Mike Bordin ,Roddy Bottum &Billy Gould came out with an album called \\"King For A Day , Fool For A Lifetime\\".These guys were also known as Faith No More.Off that album was a certain song titled \\"The Gentle Art Of Making Enemies\\" A track which was nothing but pure originality and blew everything in its path it was something never done nor heard before.That was BRILLIANT. 3 years down the line a band comes along called System of a Dump ....sorry down .....and they decide ok lets make an album rip off a few riffs from here and there and no one will know.So what we have here is 3 albums ripped off from this one Faith No More song....unbelivable...no ones gonna belive me...so listen for u r self.Everything that soad do from the guitars to the vocals is just ripped off that one song and they ve actually made 3 albums.So what we get is Serj whatever singing bout the armenian genocide like no one would notice he s ripping off The Brilliant Mike Patton.Get a life people listen to good music not this worthless piece of s**t.Long Life Faith No More .Also if u feel there is any variation in this soad album yea that comes from another song \\"Cuckoo For Caca\\".
0679311726|5.0|&quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot; is a simply amazing book. I first read it having no previous knowlage of what happened in Rwanda. I must admit I didn't even realize there WAS a genocide. I bought this book specifically to find out what happened and I was not disapointed. It gives a detailed account of the entire war, including events leading up to it so the reader can better understand the motives behind the destruction. At times this book can be extremly hard to read (in my opinion at least). There are very graphic descriptions of people being tortured, raped and killed, but it only manages to further illustrate the point that the world messed up the whole situation beyond belief. I would definitly recommend this book to anyone interested in Rwanda. Your money will not be misplaced I promise you.

B0002NRRAG|5.0|As a radio jazz DJ (WOMR 92.1 FM) and serious jazz afficionado I have a passion for female jazz vocalists and track hundreds of them, known and unknown. Simply put, Madeline Peyroux is a superb and moving singer, the real deal, with her own voice. I was ecstatic when Madeline peaked into the NYC music seen again last year, knowing that it would just be a matter of time before we got another recording from her..at last. First, she popped up on a joint effort with William Gallison, which flew unde the radar screen, and now this! I just hope she doesn't get disenchanted with the acclaim and visibility that is sure to follow from this terrific CD and disappear again. I find the references of other reviewers to Nora Jones amusing. Her immense popularity as a pop/country singer notwithstanding, comparing her to the truly gifted jazz/blues chanteuse Peyroux is like comparing Doris Day or Dolly Parton to Billie Holiday.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|!Heather's teenage son!    Well, yesterday my dad bought this CD for me and I popped it into my stereo and was instantly amazed with the catchy lyrics & beats.  If you're into Interpol or Modest Mouse, then you'd probably like Franz Ferdinand as much as I did.  This is probably one of the best CD's of 2004, along with Green Day's American Idiot.    The best songs on here are:    1. The Dark Of The Matinee  2. This Fire  3. Michael    IF you don't like them, fine, that's your opinion, but if you did like their singles 'Take Me Out' & 'This Fire' than you'd love all eleven songs on this wonderful disc.
B0000026NC|5.0|I own both sets, and listen to them regularly.  I even went to see Floyd live during the Division Bell tour.  But, the bottom line is the sound of David Gilmour's guitar is much better on Delicate Sound of Thunder.  Gilmour's work on Pulse is way over-processed, and that's his doing (you should see the TWO racks of digital processing equipment he uses.) Don't believe me?  Do a side-by-side comparison of \\"Sorrow\\", \\"Time\\" or \\"Money\\".  His guitar just sounds bigger and clearer on the DSoT versions.      <br /> <br />Additionally, he sings with much more passion (compare the versions of \\"Money\\", for instance) on this older release.  Often times, Gilmour sounds bored on Pulse, even though his playing is as fiery as ever. <br /> <br />While I was a bigger fan of The Division Bell (and the songs from it) than Momentary Lapse of Reason, Delicate Sound of Thunder remains the definitive live Pink Floyd document.
B0002UXBD6|5.0|I've been listening to Green Day since Kerplunk came out and fell in absolute love with their music after Dookie!!!  Dookie changed my life and Green Day was my favorite band through highschool.  NImrod and Warning were ok albums and I think I liked them as much as I did, because I had loved and had so much respect for Green Day through the years.  AMERICAN IDIOT?  INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!  This album is amazing!  When I heard the new album was to be a rock opera, I was like,\\"oh man, please don't tell me they have jumped into that abyss.\\"  Was I ever wrong, Green Day showed me and the rest of the nation what a talented bunch they remain.  This album is a crucial must have, not just for Green Day fans and punk fans, but for everyone in general.  This is a very important album, and while the band doesn't lose it trademark sound, there is a new feel to a few of the songs, and I think that Green Day has just left the realm of punk rockstars, and have etched their names into stone, as Punk Rock Legends.
B00003CXCS|4.0|The movie is in itself a classical-- the music, the scenery, and kids, except for the war part, which carries a saddening tone for the whole piece.  I gave it four stars because of my bad experience with the DVD disc. The Movie is worth five stars. Above all, from a personal point, the Amazon Service Team deserve 10 stars, for their responsiveness and care about the customer. I have purchased a lot kids' and educational stuff, to my complete satisfaction.  GOOOOO AMAZON.
B00000JY1X|5.0|The only \\"boxed set\\" I have ever purchased.  Each song is better than the last, even when it's on repeat.
B000002B7O|5.0|the title track, diary of a madman, is the one song that has the greatest guitar pieces in the history of guitar. there are virtually no flaws to it, and it is beautiful. if i catch anyone trying to cover this song i will cry because this song is unmatchable. simply flawless. there is not a greater song on this planet. and those of you who said that flying high again and over the mountain were the only good songs i want to spit on you you're a commercial idiot. i cry that randy rhoads has never been alive while i have i want him back he would have been the greatest ever. just five more years and it would have been insane how good he'd become. those beginning arpeggios in diary of a madman haven't been beat by any guitarist anywhere. rhoads's transitions throughout the parts of each song are so smooth never anything random; just such a great dark energy. RANDY COME BACK.  <br /> <br />and also all the songs are good on here i personally dont like flying high again it's too poppy. the best tracks are believe and diary of a madman. gosh rhoads would have been something.  <br />
B000002KHB|5.0|'Machine Head' is an album which never fails me even after constant listening. If 'Highway Star' wont do it'Picturs of home' will if 'Space trucking' can't do it then 'Maybe I'm a leo' will. This album is amazing great music great tunes and great vocals. The album is the most blusy of the Mark-II line up and the guitar work by Ritchie Blackmore is amazing. There are so many classic solos and riffs here that one can keep changing their favorites.    'Highway star' is the real classic Deep Purple song on this one, a real fast paced number with the typical fast car/girls lyrics. The solos duel on this one between Ritchie Blackmore on Guitar and Jon Lord on the keys could be one of the best ever in Rock 'n' Roll history.    'Lazy' is another song which is realy great with killer guitar work by Ritchie and a bluesy feel from Ian's Harmonica and vocals.      \\"Never Before' is the only average number on this CD and it ain't too bad. Even a simple sounding song like 'Maybe I'm a Leo' is made more interesting by Ian Paice where he constantly keeps changing the Drumming to keep interest (and this one has two solos by Ritchie with such flowing blusy feel).     Too bad another blusy ballad 'When a blind man cries' Which was recorded by the band during these sessions did'nt make it to the original album. It is however present on the 25th Anniversay edition.    Though not as Inovative or path breaking as the earlier two albums 'Machine head' was the classic mix between high quality music and commercial success.    Buy it as you will never get a better fussion between hard rock and commercial melody with no compromise on musicmanship.    By the way 'Machine Head' is also  where the original 'Smoke on the water' features.
0064407667|4.0|This story is nice even if it is unfortunate. This is one of my favorite books because it is an adventure book with lots of unfortunate adventures. My favorite character here is Violet and Sunny Baudelaire because they are both brave and they are both fast thinkers. I hate Count Olaf, their first evil guardian who tried to steal their fortune. He is evil!! Very, very, very, very, very, very bad to the Baudelaire orphans. He treats them like maids and not children. This book is very exciting because in the middle or last parts, you could not wait to know what will happen next. Some people have this feeling that the story will have a happy ending when they read a happy part in the book.  <br /> <br />Some people get angry because of what is happening in the story. I felt sorry for the Baudelaires because they did not have a stable guardian because of Count Olaf. Every time the Baudelaire orphans move, Count Olaf will be in disguise until he convinces the guardians to give the orphans to him or until he kills the guardians. My classmates say that Book Five is the nicest. It is the only book where they find a triplet, three children who become true friends who care for them. <br /> <br />I recommend this series of books to other people because it would make them realize that exciting books do not always have happy endings. There are also some good books that have unhappy endings. If you are reading this review, I would like to recommend that you borrow the books from a friend or buy the book from a bookstore. If you want to buy it, better hurry before it gets sold out!!  <br />
B00001QGPS|3.0|Don't listen to anything anyone else has said about this album, listen to me. I know what im talking about. Method man and Redman are by far 2 of the most talented rappers that exist. This album isnt solid all the way through, but it is definately worth owning. There are plenty of tight songs here that will become your favorites for a while. Looking back on this album, i wouldnt trade it for anything, i have had some good smoke sessions to this album and so will you, there are some classic's on it.  Just keep in mind that the ' skip ' track feature on your CD player will probably come in handy a few times. Otherwise, it makes my top 50 list.
0061040967|5.0|If one were to read The Last Hero in the same frame of mind that one would reserve for the majority of Pratchett's works, then one would come away feeling a bit let down.  There is no plot layering, there is no superbly rich back-story, and the footnotes are very limited.  Fortunately, that's exactly what makes this book's star shine so bright.<br /><br />We have Cohen the Barbarian and the Silver Hoard returning something that was stolen from the gods, and paying it back with interest in the name of not dying in bed, but with their boots on.  We also have the familiar faces of Captain Carrot, Leonard of Quirm, Rincewind, and the Librarian rocketing to space, landing on the moon, and crashing through the gates of the city of the gods.  Metaphorical of science attacking religion at the front door with flight/space programs?  Probably.  An in depth look and social comedy delivered via parody?  Definitey not.<br /><br />What makes this work a jewel is that it is a work about Heroes (the capital \\"H\\" was intended).  In my worldview, Pratchett would have destroyed the work by making it a typical tale of the Disc.  Most fans of fantasy know their mythology and will identify with what I am talking about.  The story is written much as a storyteller of old would have told it, had he been telling it in first person omniscient point of view of course.<br /><br />Kidby's art is absolutely stunning, and there are a few images that I simply stared at for long periods of time before turning the page.  The Cohen as Conan reference on the flyleaf will please any traditional fantasy art fan and hearken back the classic days of Frazetta.
B0000024LN|5.0|Muddy waters isnt \\"arguably\\" one of the best Hip hop albums of all time. It IS one of the best hip hop albums of all time. The entire cd goes off. The beats are unmatched by ANYONE. I still have never heard a rap album that is as solid as this one, the entire way through. Every sound is masterful. Every bit of audio recorded on this one disc is a classic and will never be defeated. Never. I promise you that. You must have decent speakers to comprehend its genius. If you dont, then dont bother. I highly recommend this album to anyone that enjoys brilliant music. You simply must have this in your collection, or you dont deserved to refer to your assembly of music cd's as a \\"collection\\". For its originality alone, i can easily say that this is in the top 3 hip hop albums of all time.
B000065IBC|4.0|U2 is at their best live, and they've tried to catch that strength at various times on recording, with limited success each time. Remember &quot;Rattle and Hum,&quot; the motion picture? Good for what it was, but a bit over ambitious, even for U2. &quot;Under a Blood Red Sky&quot; is the first attempt (I'm pretty sure) to put their live stuff onto a recorded medium, and they do a pretty good job, I must say. Everybody knows the anthems &quot;Sunday, Bloody Sunday&quot; and &quot;New Years Day,&quot; probably &quot;Gloria&quot; and &quot;I Will Follow&quot; as well, and those tracks come out great. But it's the lesser known tunes that really get pulled out in this one, &quot;the Electric Co.&quot; sounds awesome and of course, &quot;40&quot; is anthemic live. If you're new to U2, this album probably isn't for you, but if you appreciate their old stuff you'll love this one for sure.
B0000029GA|5.0|Back in '94 nas released the most intelligent and banger that would be one of the most classic, real hip hop albums all almost all times...

0312319517|2.0|After The Phantom of Manhattan Forsyth returned to his first kind of books with the Veteran and Avenger... but results are not at the same level of books from his 'first life'.

0451450523|5.0|In reading other reviews, I noticed that the 5 star reviews got their analyses right on the mark, while many 1 star reviews were lacking any appropriate criticism.   <br /> <br />One poor review said that the book could not decide if it was fantasy or parody.  A parody, by definition, imitates another piece of work, and there is no other piece of work quite like this one.  Peter S. Beagle simply knows what any good writer should know-- that a piece of writing will be boring if it focuses on one emotion or mood to the exclusion of all others.     J. R. R. Tolkien and William Shakespeare knew the value of humor in a work which was not expressly written to be humorous, but it is Beagle who finds the perfect balance of humor and beauty in this novel which will take the reader through nearly every emotion there is.  This is a book that does NOT make the mistake that all too many fantasy novels make-- taking themselves too seriously.  The label \\"fantasy\\" does not have a set of laws stating that humor must be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br />That said, you will like this book if: <br />*you appreciate the amazing things that can be done with the English language. <br />*you appreciate the amazing things that Peter S. Beagle can do with the English language. <br />*you won't throw a hissy fit if the ending isn't perfectly happy. <br />*you like unicorns. <br />*you enjoy fantasy, but don't insist all fantasy be like Dungeons and Dragons.   <br />*you are a kid at heart. <br />*you enjoyed the movie. <br />*you can appreciate a humor which is sometimes subtle, sometimes obvious. <br />*you like poetry. <br />*you're looking for story that was written to be perfect, not to sell, and then sell a sequel. <br /> <br />There is no sequel to The Last Unicorn, but at the end you will be wishing there were, not because of loose ends, but because the story is too beautiful to leave.

B000089RVX|5.0|Most of the CDs I own I listen to for a while, and then get tired of them.  This one I have been listeing to for over a year, and I've been to an Evanescence concert.

(I have also purchased their \\"Origin\\" CD)
B00006HBUC|3.0|I really felt dissapointed, because as many movies coming from old popular cartoons, the plot was so silly and predictable that you could go to the kitchen, put some popcorn in the microwave, brew a coffee, rest 10 minutes and losing nothing important. <br />In these days, these movies just become a tournament about special effects. Silly and dumb.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This an award winning movie?  Oscar material?  Not even close.  Moore's movie is akin to made for tv fare.  I did laugh at the ice cream truck scene, but the appeals to pity, gratuitous gore, profanity, and utter dishonesty in editing make this movie rather tedious.  I do not share Mr. Moore's socialist politics, indeed I view him as anti-American.  However, in view of the ballyhooed press I expected a more compelling movie.  As a propagandist, Moore is at his best showing dead babies, maimed soldiers and grieving families, but sorrow needs no cinematic skill.  Moore dwells upon these negatives of war torn Iraq with a blind eye; indeed Moore's vision seems akin to that of a one-eyed cleric. His occasional touch of humor also lacks art, having the routineness and impact of an average late night tv joke.  As a documentary, the film fails completely.  The dozens of significant factual deceptions documented in depth by Kopel on the internet destroys the film's credibility.  Without credibility, the movie becomes high schoolish; a movie clipping montage strung together to provide images and words for Moore's peculiar story, which is decidedly different from the many stories from which the images were extracted.  You may choose to beleive Moore's conspiratorial tale or not, but I doubt that Moore will have much to do with that belief.  Moore exhibits no art in his craft and his work lacks both persuasion and power.
B00006CXSS|5.0|1. The rattle of Lt Winters' plane as it flew toward Normandy. <br />2. Watching the men of Easy Co. walk slowly down a snowy road toward a dark forest that had already claimed so many lives.  <br />3. Shelves filled with laundry parcels that would never be claimed because their owners were dead. <br />4. A medic to whom a pair of scissors is not a convenience, but an urgent necessity. <br />5. The flash of passing streetlights on a bus conjuring images of battlefield violence in a soldier's memory. <br /> <br />Those are only five of the \\"little things\\" that got to me...much more so than the grander scale of battles and gunfire. <br />Please watch this if you can.
B00005JNEI|5.0|You can like or dislike Michael Moore and his own reading of reality but truth is out there, and this movie trails to it. <br />World acclaimed, well produced and truly respectful, this is great documentary and shows us the negative effects of radicalism in our own government. Now, with Osama's new release in the streets doing pro-reelection campaign you can close the circle.
B0002MRPE0|4.0|Joe Cocker's original concept for Heart and Soul was to do a collection of songs that influenced him throughout the `60's and in to the early `70's.  The concept was expanded as the project went along to include material introduced through the `90's.  The result is a collection that is on the whole very satisfying, but marred by overproduction on some of the cuts.  First, and foremost, Joe sings with his usual passion throughout the album.  For the most part, his voice is strong, although he misses a high note here and there, and sounds a little raspy at times (supposedly due to fires in LA at the time of recording).  He's still got it, though - nobody can bring feeling to a song like he does, and he's totally engaged with the material.  Many of the cuts are outstanding: \\"One\\", \\"Chain of Fools\\", \\"I Keep Forgetting\\", \\"I Put a Spell on You\\", \\"Don't Let me Be Lonely\\", \\"Jealous Guy\\" \\"Everybody Hurts\\" and particularly \\"What's Going On\\" are well sung and intelligently arranged.  As for the argument that the Marvin Gaye version was so definitive it should not have been touched, Joe's intention was to pay homage to these songs, not supplant them.  And the orchestration works on this song (an exception), setting the mood, just as the string arrangement did on the original.  The violin works on \\"One\\", as well.  However, the use of strings and synthesizers as an undercurrent on \\"I Who Have Nothing\\", \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", \\"Every Kind of People\\" and \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" gives those songs that Adult Contemporary feel that doesn't belong on a Joe Cocker album, and makes them seem somewhat lightweight.  It is this sort of thing that causes people who don't know Joe's music well to fail to give him his due.   It's a shame these songs were produced in this way, because he gives good performances and one can imagine what they would have sounded like if they weren't over arranged.  The fact that the album is predominantly ballads is not a big issue for me.  Sure, I prefer Joe as a rocker, but he has never been a pure rock singer.  He has always moved between rock, R&B and ballads, going back to the beginning of his career.  So, bottom line, Heart and Soul has enough fine moments for me to say it is more than a good album - frankly, it grows on me with each listen - but I can't help thinking what might have been.
B000002J2F|5.0|Mme si d'excellents titres comme Dodo, Mama et Abacab sont sortis subsquement  la cration de Duke, aucun album aussi constant que celui-ci n'a t cr depuis 1980. Selon moi, il s'agit galement de leur plus vari et de leur plus accessible.  <br /> <br />Pour ce qui est des pices, on retrouve de tout pour tous les gots, de l'accrocheur Turn It on Again  l'pique Duke's Travel/End en passant par des ballades de grande qualit tel Heathaze et Please Don't Ask. Les sujets tournent autour de la dception amoureuse et artistique ; en aucun cas cependant on vire dans le qutaine, le trop pompeux ou la simplicit excessive. Du beau travail! Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford et Phil Collins participent galement en matriel solo pour assurer bonne diversit entre les pces centrales composes en groupe. <br /> <br />Ct instrumentation, on retrouve toujours l'influence premire des claviers de Tony Banks sur le son gnral de l'album. Cependant, au contraire des albums prcdents, on ne retrouve pratiquement pas de solo de M. Banks intgrs aux pices. Il a plutt choisi de les regrouper sur le monstrueux Duke's Travel. Chers amateurs, vous ne pourrez tre dus! La production est trs bonne galement. On peut enfin sentir le poids de la batterie sans qu'il soit exagr comme sur Invisible Touch, ce qui constitue une belle qualit pour le batteur que je suis :). <br /> <br />En rsum, Duke est un album que vous apprcierez grandement si vous tes un nophyte ou un fan de Genesis  l'esprit moindrement ouvert. Il ne ncessite pas autant d'coute que les premiers avant de se rvler, ce qui peut constituer un avantage pour les nouveaux intresss  ce grand groupe. Dans mon cas il est numro 1 avec 3 Sides Live ct frquence d'coute de mes Genesis (Trespass  Genesis l'album). Dcouvrez-le! 10/10
6305922756|5.0|First and foremost I just want to take a moment to laugh at the idiot below who states that he's intelligent while also believing that Spinal Tap is a real band and he says he has all that knowledge of music and yet, Limp Bizkit is his favorite band.  That guy made my day.<br /><br />Anyways onto the DVD.<br /><br />It is excellent from start to finish.<br /><br />The opening menu is classic and quite hilarious.<br /><br />All of the characters are played out well and it has many unforgettable moments that will have you laughing.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I originally bought this game for my classroom to help my students develop thinking skills.  When it first arrived, I took the game home to figure out how to play it before introducing it to my students--and I was hooked!  My own children are ages 10 and 11 and they love the game (we are buying a game for home), but I teach students up to age 18 and they enjoy the game just as much.  Educationally, it helps younger students develop a better understanding of spatial relations and planning ahead.  For older students (and adults) it helps to develop various strategy skills.   <br /> <br />Unlike most educational games, the rules are simple and once you've played it through one time (or watched it through one time) all your effort can go into plotting your moves.  The game doesn't run out of possibilities, either; every game is different, even if you play with the same people over and over. <br /> <br />As an educator, parent, and game enthusiast, this was money well spent.
B00005JLH3|5.0|We all have our favorite sports movies whether it's football (Remember the Titans, Varsity Blues), baseball (Angels in the Outfield, Major League), or cheerleading (Bring It On) but now we can finally add marching band to the list.  I was in marching band all four years of high school (I played clarinet), and I had a blast despite the reputation us band geeks put on ourselves. Even though this movie  primarily focused on the percussion section, watching it I can still (in a way) feel the rush I felt when i was performing on the football field.  If I had to pick one thing in this movie I didn't like, it would be the ending performance by the rival band from Morris Brown College.  Those who have seen the movie will know exactly what I'm talking about.  No marching band in their right mind would ever do that in a million years.
B00005MAM2|4.0|Akira is a great movie and always mis-pronounced by Americans, much like the Japanese beer Asahi is mis-pronounced.  Nevertheless, this is not a childrens animated feature.  Yes there is some nudity, but it is not that type of anime.   <br />  The film is a saga, it is long, many people not interested may find it downright boring.  I don't recommend this movie to anyone under 18, mostly because they probably won't enjoy it.   <br />  Much like Blade Runner is often discounted by people the first time they see it, the same often happens to Akira.   <br />  If you enjoy Blade Runner, more like if you downright love Blade Runner, you will understand this movie and enjoy it, despite its 124 minute run time.   <br />  Regarding which version to buy:  Personally I grew up watching the original U.S. release with the original English voices.  Most purists enjoy the old-single disk version much better than the newer special edition.   <br />  I would buy the original version first, then if you fall in love with Akira, it might be worth it to get the newer one.  Remember, DVD has only been around in the U.S. since 1997 and some of these first pressings are already out of print.  That's why I always suggest getting the earliest printing first, because it is more likely to find the later pressings later.   <br />  Akira is a perfect example of this.  The version most Akira fans grew up watching in the U.S. might not be around for that much longer, and it will probably get phased out soon.
B00004SCX6|4.0|This is a great second album for Britney Spears to put out.  She comes out with some really great catchy dance numbers, but she's not one for ballads.  For one things, she doesn't have the voice for it and they're always too cheesy.  Leave the ballads to Celine Dion.
0783225857|5.0|This B/W film is simply one of the best movies ever made. Nominated for 8 Academy Awards, it and \\"Lawrence Of Arabia\\" dominated the 1962 Oscar race. Gregory Peck won his only Oscar for the role of Atticus Finch (which was his personal favorite movie). Watch his nine minute trial summation, done in one take, for a tour-de-force of acting.    It is a complex film of family and race relationships with none of the epic qualities that won \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" the best picture/director Oscars. But in terms of pure acting and story-telling (Horton Foote won the best screenplay Oscar for his superior adaption of Harper Lee's novel), the movie cannot be improved. Robert Duvall made his screen debut in his small but pivotal part of Boo Radley -- he dominates the screen without a single line of dialog. The film is worth repeated viewings for something new will be discovered.    The two children portraying the Finch siblings also made their screen debut and Mary Badham lost the best supporting actress Oscar to Patty Duke, another child actress, for \\"The Miracle Worker.\\" Her friendship with Mr. Peck and the antedotes of making the film is told in both Gary Fishgall's biography of Gregory Peck (2002) and the excellent documentary that accompanies this DVD Collector's Edition.     The movie was banned in parts of the South during its original release for its sympathic portrait of black Americans. It is still a powerful movie that has not been dated with the passage of the years. Gregory Peck said that he would be forever remembered upon his death for the part of Atticus Finch and he was right -- all the obituaries lead with it in June, 2003.

6304712944|1.0|My earliest memory is seeing an outdoor community theatre performance of Camelot on a warm summer night.  There was romance, there was drama and tragedy, there were swords and real horses and fire.  It captivated my sisters and me so much we each remember it in a visceral way.  As a result, every few years I return to this movie with renewed hope (I have selective memory loss when it comes to the classics being butchered on film) but always end up disappointed.  This movie is such a terrible failure. <br />I love Richard Harris, and his acting is strong, but he just doesn't have the voice for the role.  Sadly, no one in this production of one of my favorite musicals does - such a shame.  Redgrave is simply wrong for the role, and Nero seems a parody of what Lancelot should be. <br />Even the strangely dated sets and costumes would be excusable if the performances were better, but unfortunately the entire thing falls flat.  The themes of duty, love, passion, and betrayal seem limp in the hands of the stars and the director. <br />When King Arthur reprises Camelot at the end, a good production should capture a moment as heartbreaking as the moment when Robert Preston reminds Ron Howard that he \\"always think(s) there's a band\\" in the Music Man.  Instead, the only heartbreak here is that one of the great gems of Musical Theatre was squandered on such a failure of a cinematic production.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Along with Radiohead's OK Computer, this is the best album of the past 10 years. I bought it never hearing Beck before and it didn't get me the first 5 times I listened. I put it away and pulled it out half a year later and I haven't stopped listening since.  <br /> <br />Starting with the guitar strum on 'The Golden Age, all the sounds in Sea Change fit and don't fit, but they all work perfectly. Nigel Goodrich, a legend in my eyes, set a room of noisy atmosphere around it, and made this album great. Beck by himself would already be great with his lyrics and voice displaying his soul. This was a bummed man who wrote and sang these songs. The guitars and strings and gentle drumming blend to make a great sound. <br />  <br />I can listen to this whenever I'm sad and it is perfect. It doesn't bring me out of the spell, but it does match my emotions. Take a listen, and then a couple more.    <br />
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|James Maynard Keenan had always inpire me with his music and unique sound. This Album \\"Thirteen steps\\" has a lot of meanings. Each song is beautifull and I think this album is very relaxing and makes youthink a lot while listen to the lyrics.
B000008LNS|5.0|first of all when the man who called bad english crap,and put journey, and toto as sounding like 80's crap, this literally is an unlogical statement, the man may not like the 80's sound but it was the last decade of great music before lousy rap, and watered down, drum machine, keyboard oriented r&B, and pop music took over,the truth is Toto. and journey, can blow away any mainstream metal, or hard rock group on todays scene as well as in the 80's these guys are as good of songwriters as any in the world, and they burn on their instruments, live, and on this record, and if the man thinks songs like roseanna, and mushanga, or mr. friendly, or even stuff on this record is easy stuff to compose on instruments I would love to see his transcribed score, or him play these songs, its funny when these people judge great musicians like toto, the thing is so many of them have never played an instrument, and toto always has been far more apprecciated throughout the world, for their many nusic styles, singing, and musicianship, the wild thing is that reviewer fails to mention the fact that it is the legend jeff porcaro's last album, and that jeffs death has affected the industry, many albums feature only drum machines, I give this album a 5 toto does not have to play the styles to change with the times, toto does their own thing, noone seems to recognize originality anymore, everything has to sound like britney spears, or awful rap, or usher.Toto on this album played music that they wanted to never compromising to what everyone else does, the whole album is steller, and if luke wants to take a shredding guitar solo or paich wants to play a keyboard solo its all good, toto don't follow trends. The reviewer was off base on his criticism if you like toto, or want to check out a band that today continues to put out steller music, and tours, with many different music styles toto is great, and journey is strong in touring the states, and their music today,has some ballads, but also some good rock tunes, check these bands out, as for the reviewer I think you need to listen to more styles, and be more diverse rather than cutting these great musicians down, and their fantastic music,because todays scene is so gray and gloomy the underground progressive rock, rock, pop, and jazz fusion is great, this record is better than any rock on radio today,period. Toto is great!!!
B00005YUPO|5.0|My daughter really enjoys this video (and that's who's opinion counts for watching this right).  She gets very excited watching this.  We sit there with her and name the things she's seeing.  And since our daughter hated tummy time we used this as bribary. We'd put her on her tummy and she would lift up to see it, she was too busy watching and listening to notice she was having to work her little muscles.
B00000IPAX|5.0|many people say that Enema was the point where Blink went from pure punk to pop punk sellouts.  I dissagree.  I think that when Scott left that they figured they had to create a new sound for themselves to keep it fresh.  Before they new it they were selling millions of CDs and were on TRL all the time.  After that, well...that for another review.  Anyway, if you like punk, buy this.  If you call yourself a true blink fan then buy this.  Most of all, if you want a great album that changed rock music forever then buy this.  Another thing, most of the best songs on this album are the ones with Mark singing.  Odd though because Tom is supposed to be more of a lead singer... <br /> <br />1.Dumpweed--10/10--a great chorus and a strong opener. <br /> <br />2.Don't leave me--10/10--One of the best on the album.  Very hard verses. <br /> <br />3.Aliens exist--9/10--cool sort of techno song.  Doesnt really sound like punk but still awesome. <br /> <br />4.going away to college--10/10--very emotional song with an awesome chorus.  Best song on here. <br /> <br />5.what's my age again--10/10--second best on here.  Great chorus and transitions. <br /> <br />6.dysentary gary--10/10--funny song with cool guitaring <br /> <br />7.adam's song--10/10--a slow song about suicide.  Really touching <br /> <br />8.all the small things--10/10--great single.  Coulda been better but it's great anyway. <br /> <br />9.the party song--10/10--hilarious song but sort of weird.  Very very very fast! <br /> <br />10.mutt--10/10--very diverse musically and good lyrics <br /> <br />11.wendy clear--10/10--great song period.  more emo than punk <br /> <br />12.anthem--10/10--opening is weak but the rest of it is awesome
B00005JNEI|4.0|It's odd, reading the ultra-negative reviews of this. It's as though these people saw a different film (or maybe saw it through different eyes). <br /> <br />Michael Moore does NOT: <br />- Portray American soldiers as bloodthirsty warmongers. <br />- Say President Bush caused 9/11 <br />or any of the other bizarre claims. <br /> <br />He DOES use a relentless series of well-documented facts and, in particular, the words of President Bush, Condaleeza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney and others to present his argument. Their words, from their mouths; their actions and inaction. <br /> <br />He presents American soldiers as genuine patriots who are willing to risk their lives to do the bidding of their nation and commander-in-chief - without question - to protect that nation. Moore is in no way criticising those soldiers. He's questioning the decisions of that commander-in-chief to put those men and women in harm's way. He's also showing us a taste of what \\"harm's way\\" really means - and it's horrific. <br /> <br />There's no question Moore is making a political point. It's very explicit and, to me, makes it very well. It's fairly free of Moore's cringing attempts to embarrass. <br /> <br />To those who want to present an alternative political point: please present a coherent argument and set of evidence. Beating your chest and calling yourself \\"Christian\\" and \\"patriotic\\" (and Moore the opposite) are not enough. It's clear to me that Moore's commitment to the USA and the principles it was founded on is extremely strong. <br /> <br />Everyone should see this film. And, if a filmmaker produces a documentary presenting the opposite viewpoint to a similar standard, we should all see that too. <br /> <br />Incidentally, Michael Moore isn't from \\"Hollywood\\". He's from Flint, Michigan. \\"Hollywood\\" - specifically Disney - refused to distribute this film. Presumably because they were concerned about the consequences.
B00020HEG6|4.0|I'll start off by saying that KIDS with the musical understanding and taste of zooplankton ought not write reviews unless they want everyone to know that they are musically/culturally challenged.  The title \\"Kid Review\\" is really unnecessary.  Anyone reading the \\"kid review\\", can tell it isn't learned enough to be out of grade school yet.  Let me give \\"the kid\\" some hints.  Never review a MOVIE when you're supposed to review a SCORE (I'm about to review a good score that I have never seen the film to; and no, I don't consider myself a Harry Potter fan.)  That just shows that (1) \\"kid reviewer\\" is not looking at the score objectively and that (2) \\"kid reviewer\\" must have a brain that can not be stimulated in anyway except VISUALLY.  Its endorsement of the score for \\"Pirates\\" illustrates my point perfectly.  A great movie.  A not-so-great soundtrack.  Don't take my word for it.  Go read some professional film-score-critic reviews.  You'll be pressed to find one that gives Badelt's score a high rating (we won't go into the reasons why right now, but you can always check my review).  My advice to the Kid: 1- Go take a course on music appreciation or music history.  2- Do a lot lf listening. 3- Maybe take some music lessons yourself.  4- Do yourself a favor.  Don't write anymore reviews until you've done this. <br /> <br />As for the score, Excellent.  I was afraid that I would be hearing the same old thing this time.  I was pleasantly surprised.  This is a very unique score.  Lots of variety among familiarity.  Beautiful orchestrations and textures.  I recommend this score to Williams fans and music fans alike.  If you didn't like the last Potter score.  You very well might like this one.   <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|I love Michael Moore.  He has guts and conviction.  In this searing film, he shows Bush and his cronies to be arrogant, ignorant fools.  Of course, we already knew this, but Moore's movie illustrates it as plain as day with devastating results.
B0002KVUKW|4.0|Watching this movie I don't know why it's hated by so many. I watched the Day After Tomorrow yesterday and watched Van Helising today. I must say that Van Helsing is much funner movie and the one I'd want to watch more than once. People knock it for having so much action, well isn't that good ? I mean to me that made it entertaining through-out and it was never dull. I actually saw a 1 out of 10 review for this at igndvd.com and no way is this movie that bad. Maybe I liked it because I always wanted a movie with all the classic monsters together. I think Stephen Sommers does a pretty damn good job making adventures though. I actually liked the Mummy movies and if you liked those then you should be blown away by Van Helsing. I also really liked the look of the film, it a has a really nice classic monster movie look to it. Plus Hugh Jackman does a fine job in the title role, but when isn't he good ? It's just Dracula that I had a problem with, he's not that scary plus they needed a better actor playing him. Dougray Scott (Mission Impossible 2) who was originally supposed to play Wolverine in X-Men would've made a much better dracula. Kate Beckinsale  doesn't give the best performance either but hell I wasn't listening to her talk, was too busy drooling over her out-fit lol.
B00007JVBI|4.0|THe music is honest, the lyrics are personal, and poetic. ANd mostly the album reaches into your heart so that you have to listen. Overall, what a great album. I guess i'd call it Edgy alternative acoustic rock, but there are some rockers too. THe more personal songs are better, because that is what she does best. Just the guitar and her voice are inspiring, and haunting. IT's truly an incredible experience. I urge anyone who appreciates NIck Drake, or Jeff Buckley to hear this album.
B0002MB7QW|3.0|Mankind is at risk after huge storms start to happen all the over the world. Dennis Quaid plays the scientist that warns the government to take action before it is too late and of course they don't listen. That is just a part of the usual Roland Emmerich formula that he uses here. He also loves to blow up helocopters and here he just has them crash and the pilots freeze to death. Plus Dennis Quaid walking from Washington to NY City is about as believeable as Jeff Goldbluim taking down the alien space ship shields with a computer virus in ID4. Everyone that goes outside will freeze to death yet Quaid can surivive just because he is used to cold climates ? Although Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhall are good as father and son it's only the great special effects that save the movie from the silly script. Some of the action sequences are really good  too but once the storm is over so is the movie basically because it has nothing else going for it. It tries to keep our attention with the drama it tries to have  but that doesn't exactly work.
B0000AM6K2|1.0|Before i came here to write my review i quickly glanced over the reviews to see if everyone felt the same way about this album as i do. I was quite shocked when i saw alot of 5 and 4 star reviews. I almost wondered if i shouldn't write my review so not to rock the boat. But i couldn't!. I couldn't stand by and watch while people bellieved all these great reviews and then go out and buy a total piece of garbage.<br /><br /> I like slow moving albums, but this is ridiculous. If this is an album to the music of the year Josh was born i wish 1972 would have never come. THis guy is judging all of 1972 by America or some of those bands, cause it sure isn't the kind of music i listne to from that year. THe lyrics!!! oh the lyrics. CMON!! Laughable to the point of absurdity. Did he let his kids write the words, cause no mature man can write this crap. ......sorry i had to throwup. I don't mean to bash this album the way it seems. I realize that, apparently, alot of people like this album. So if you do, i'm sorry. I insist that you keep on listining. But for those who haven't been poisoned yet i'm trying to save you.

B0000AQVCL|1.0|Seriously. Origianal is great, origianal is really great. You can hear the same riff from are are you gonna be my girl on two songs that come to mind (if you must know, it's something by iggy pop and outta my head by spiderbait.) i come from Australia, and there are some great rock bands over here, and jesus. this is putting a stain on our reputation. Look what you've done, is just a beatles ripoff. I'm ok with covers, just as long as they give some sort of credit to the origianal band, This does not. Now as for music quality, this band is really very bad, i have to admit, when i see photos of them i'm entertained and the cover art and video clips were pretty cool. these guys should've been artists. But they're not, so i'm angry.
B000002TPS|5.0|Dave Mustaine is the greatest songwriter ever. Youthasia proves it. The power of the lyrics and the melodies are outstanding. General Mustaine really put in his blood and sweat for this album. Released in 1994, still remembered and respected in 2004.  <br /> <br />~Megadeth Forever~
B000003TA9|5.0|This album is the perfect mix between the strange ambience of \\"Daydream Nation\\" and the pop sensibility of \\"Goo.\\" <br />It is Sonic Youth's most diverse album and the only completely unlistenable song on here is \\"Nic Fit.\\" (where sonic youth decided they would discard Butch Vig's fantastic production and produce the track themselves, it is only 56 seconds long and i still can't get through it. [you'll have to hear to understand.]) <br />Thurston Moore, Kim Gordon and Steve Shelley all give their respective best performances here (Wish Fullfillment, Drunken Butterfly and Chappel Hill (which is arguably Shelleys best performance compared to \\"Shadow of a Doubt\\" on E.V.O.L.) respectively). The band together also gives their best performances on this album, the beautifully sombre \\"Theresa's Sound World.\\" and the unbelievably cathcy \\"Chappel Hill\\". <br /> <br />
B000002U82|5.0|I heard this album for the first time in 2001 and I could not believe what I had been missing all my life! Pink Floyd is unarguably the greatest band that ever surfaced earth.     Some of the greatest bands in my opinion:    Pink Floyd  steve vai  Marilyn Manson  Megadeth  Metallica  Buckethead  Opeth
B00005B36H|5.0|If you are anything of a musician, you will love this CD. It has some of Tool's best instrumentals. From the changing time signitures of The Patient and Lateralis, to the beautiful bass/guitar lines of Schism, to the complexity of the drumming in Ticks and Leeches. You can't leave out Maynard's strangely perfect voice out of the equation either. Without him, the band would not be the same. While other's may say Aenima or Undertow are Tool's best work, I can see that only as being the fact that they have more catchy metal songs on those. Lateralus is a genious album, and I highly recommened it, as I found it superb.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I have watched this movie several times. It is a really well made movie and the characters do an amazing job. It is one of those movies you do not want to watch if you are a weak hearted person. It gets VERY disturbing. It is not as much of a graphically disturbing movie, but more of a psychological one. It will affect you for a couple of hours, if not days. I recommend it anyone and everyone.
0385507755|4.0|It's frustrating to read others complain about the constant repition of phrases and words, or the lack of proper grammar. It's very, very clear that this was intended. Personally, I found the raw way it was published to be refreshing. Yes, sometimes a comma would have helped but the book itself makes up for it.
B0000CO0VR|4.0|Although most may find this album not as bright as Enigma's previous ones, it's still worthy of listening to over and over again.  Beautifully done.
B00005JNEI|1.0|The truth is that this is nowhere close to an accurate, objective documentary. It attempts to bash President Bush without realizing he has implemented successful and beneficial policies while in office. No president has been perfect. Many presidents have had to make the tough pronouncement of war. Michael Moore has no respect for the country or what the president has on his shoulders, and it comes through in this film. I wholeheartedly ask you to not consider this as truth or as the whole picture.
B00005JLEU|5.0|After seeing Princess Mononoke on DVD, I became an instant fan of Miyazaki's films and style of animation. I saw this movie when it was released to theaters here in the US, having seen the ads for it and knowing it was going to be good. <br /> <br />It wasn't good, it was great! So many fables in the U.S. have been told to death that to see this movie was a literal breath of fresh air. It is such a wonderful new take on the old story of the hero being required to grow up and mature in order to \\"get out\\" of whatever situation he/she has been thrust into. <br /> <br />Chihiro/Sen is someone that any young girl can relate to. While she starts off seeming bratty, it's not because she's really a brat. Her family has moved, something that's all too familiar to many young children, and what young girl wouldn't be angry at her parents after being yanked away from her friends without so much as a \\"how do you feel about this\\"? She just wants to stay where she's comfortable and safe. <br /> <br />From the outset, Chihiro is required to act in ways that would be difficult for anyone, never mind a young girl! How well would you react to the sight of a \\"boiler keeper\\" who looks like a cross between a man and a spider, with little puffs of soot scurrying about as his helpers? And in the same night, find yourself having to face down a foul-tempered witch to ensure you don't suffer the same fate as your parents? <br /> <br />Every girl (and boy) has to learn to \\"grow up\\" -- to come to grips with the fact that the world can sometimes be a harsh place, and that you still have to live in it and do the best that you can; to learn to stand up for yourself with no one there to help you; to be responsible for what you (or those with you) do; to come to understand that other people besides yourself matter. Chihiro learns all of these things and more, and changes from a timid, somewhat self-absorbed person into one who has a deep inner strength and faith in herself and who cares deeply aboutthe people she has come to know. This is a story that sends a powerful message, one that will stay with the people who watch it. <br /> <br />I have a four year-old daughter, and I can't wait to show this DVD to her when she's a little older. Her younger sister will see it, too, when she's old enough. I'm betting that this will become one of their favorite movies, and that they'll want to watch it over and over again.
B00012L786|5.0|A stunning work of art. This movie has many twists and turns. A great film noir masterpiece that will hold the interest of people who only enjoy color movies and \\"new\\" releases movies. Richard Widmark is great. There are noticeable time differences here but only because it was made in 1953. Great filming. Great story.
0393057658|5.0|That answer of course is yes. This was a great book that changed how baseball teams are runned. One of Billy Beane's follewers Theo Epstien has just won a World Series with the redsox. Billy Beane made stats like OBP and OPS more popular for teams to look into when putting together teams. now that sounds like a book for just baseball stat geeks but this is a book for everyone. <br />    Michael Lewis writes about following the Oakland A's for a season and does it in an entertaining way for the stat geeks and a casual fan. From Billy Beanes new way of drafting to his way of implementing stats into finding cheap talent on the free agent market. It even gets one to know Billy Beanne as a failed baseball prospect turned Gm. This book was a terrific read and I would recommend it to anyone.
B00029LNHS|1.0|The Black Eyed Peas are not very smart. The Black Eyed Peas views are awful and they know nothing. In the song Where Is The Love they try to tackle racim and everything but lets face it. These problems aint in the united states anymore. Theres no KKK, that horrible group that i despise. I hate them and everyone else did but they simply arent around anymore so why try to bring them up like they are in modern day? They did not try to bring them up historically like rage against the machine did in the song killing in the name but instead they just wanted to bring it up with a couple of other issues that arent as nearly bad here as they are in other countries and invalid opinions that simply were only put here to try to sound meaningful and put meaning to mainstream music which is complete garbage. That is why it sounds meaningful so do you see my point? I also hate how they use the term retarded like its nothing. Its insulting and this is not the way God would want us using that term around. He doesent want it thrown around like its bad. The lyrics are distrubing as well if you care unless your a mindless club addict party fool with no brain and trys to act so called ghetto but has no idea what the term means, then go ahead and use it like that you moron. The music gets annoying on this cd its so stupid songs like labor day and pretty much every other song has mindless lyrics that you wont pay attention to because they are so dumb and stupid and they get old quick. Hey mama is stupid and shows women as objects. The black eyed peas are awful boring and they have bad political views and have invalid opinions because they do the wrong things they complain about probably. I have actually listened to the music and its quite awful. Btw racism is bad.
B0002TSZK6|5.0|All the HATE...those Bushie people have posted made me want to see this movie....and they call themselves Christians.  God must really love seeing all the hate you folks have inside.

B00005JMFQ|4.0|I watched this movie on some airline flight, and I thought it was a excellent movie. It's funny, witty, invocative, whatever that means. I love Hugh Jackman (the prime minister) in this film- it's just so classic him! One of the funniest parts is the British guy who has no luck in love in England, so for the holdiays travels to America to \\"break the curse\\"- and it does to great comedic effect! Wish that would happen to me! :) I am not sure if you need this movie in your collection (hence the 4 stars) but it's definately worth a watch, unless you get depressed always seeing others finding love.
B000148KK2|2.0|I thoroughly have enjoyed Diana Krall's music, and expected to on this album, too.  While her voice is terrific, the material isn't for me.  It would be like a dead head getting an album of Barry Manilow covers by Jerry Garcia.  Live and learn...
079073804X|5.0|As far as movie horror goes, this is the king of the heap. No movie has ever gotten under my skin like \\"The Exorcist\\" has. I've seen this movie hundreds of times, and I still get a jolt out of it. Powerful acting by a perfect cast, deeply moving subject matter, and more psychological scares than onscreen gore make this movie stand out as one of the greatest of all time. <br /> <br />Turn out the lights for best results...if you dare!!! <br />
B0000640VN|1.0|To quote the great Rowan Atkinson as Blackadder:  Utter crap!    First of all, Meg Ryan is TOO OLD for these ingenue roles she insists on playing.   She looks awful - emaciated, collagen-filled lips......NOT attractive.      And let's face it.  She plays herself in every film.  Meryl Streep she ain't!       Yes, yes....Hugh Jackman is incredibly great-looking and does a decent job, but that doesn't save the film from the sappy plot and bad acting.    Secondly, the entire premise turns my stomach.  I know the right wing in this country would have women as they were back in the 1950s....or appeared in 1950s sit coms, anyway....but going back to the 1800s?      Back when women were chattel, kept constantly pregnant (and died worn-out by the time they were 40).  Back to the days when women, like children, were seen but not heard, and were beaten if they transgressed those boundaries.      Yeah - those were the good old days.  Let's bring them back!  These uppity broads of today don't know how good they had it.      Barf bag, please!
0385336810|5.0|It's a fun book that will make you laugh, and even cry a little.  I couldn't put it down &amp; was so disapointed to actually finish it!!  It was hard for me to start another book after having finished this one...that's how much I enjoyed it!<br />I can't wait to read the rest of her books.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Be warned, this movie has facts, just like every bit of news and every documentary out there. BUT he has twisted them to bend to his will instead of objectively reporting the facts- he just hates Bush and Americans and that's what I get out of watching the movie. This movie was MADE to polarise the nation even more- makes Bush haters more hateful and thereby making Bush lovers love him more. I mean, if so many people who were actually interviewed by him feel betrayed by his fat ass because he twisted what they said, I think that speaks for itself. He's a liar. He's fat. And c'mon- he looks like the geek from High school that everyone beat on- and now he's getting his laughs because a lot of people believe his $20 pack of lies.<br /><br />If you buy this movie do yourself a favor and buy FarenHYPE 9/11 as well because then you will probably be more on the right track, since both movies are to the extremes.
0671042858|5.0|When I picked up this book to read, I would have guessed that I would end up rating it 2 stars. At most 3.<br /><br />The surprise for me was that Tricia McFarland would not be the average spoiled brat that most child stories center around but a very interesting person who I would come to deeply care about. That's the mark of a great writer in my book.<br /><br />I had always thought this was SK's attempt at how he would do The Blair Witch Project. This story couldn't be further from that other one though. It's a story about strength, and determination, about perservering, and how brave the human spirit can be.<br /><br />If you get a chance, don't miss this one like I almost did. I took me what, 5 years to give it a chance.<br /><br />I listened to the CD-Audio version read by Anne Heicht. I've never been an Ann fan. I thought she tried to get by on gimics more than acting ability. Watching her on Ally McBeal began to change my opinion. Hearing her read this has at least convinced me that \\"Anne, you can read me a story anytime!\\" Excellent capture of Tricia and the voices in her head.
0792841344|4.0|I finally got around to picking up my copy of the original Phantasm.  I'd been wanting to see it for years, having seen Phantasm 2 and 3 on cable a number of times, but kept not getting around to it for some reason or another.  This is a very weird film, no doubt, and it certainly won't appeal to those who are unwilling or unable to accept Horror films on their own terms, but those who are truly interested in Horror ought to find a lot to like here.<br /><br />Though it is most famous for the flying, drill-wielding silver ball, Phantasm is all about atmosphere.  It's very deliberately paced, which works because this pacing allows them to create a truly oppressive atmosphere.  The camerawork is slow, and smooth, and there are some nicely framed and composed shots, particularly within the funeral home.  It's not a flashy film, however, very low key, but very effective.  It's hard to put your finger on it, but everything in this film has a surreal feel to it, and there's always a definite sense that something is really wrong, even when we have little idea evidence of what is going on.  How they manage to do this in many of the more mundane scenes I'm not completely sure, but lots of it has to come from the great soundtrack.  The simple 8 note pattern that dominates the soundtrack is utterly eerie and unrelenting, and pretty much everything else works pretty well.(Also, very little of it sounds dated, and extraordinary thing for a primarily synthetic soundtrack from the 70's)  The mausoleum itself is particularly eerie, and Coscarelli wisely chooses to let the inherent creepiness of such locales speak for themselves.  The cheap, faux-fancy furnishing of your typical funeral home are offputting enough in and of themselves, and are a perfect fit for the surreal, inexplicable horror film that Coscarelli was trying to create.<br /><br />A plot synopsis would be fairly pointless, but I'll go ahead anyway.  Mike, a lonely, parent-less youth with fears of abandonment discovers that there are strange things going on at the local Funeral home, which is apparently run by the elderly and sinister Tall Man.  This leads to a whole bunch a weird crap, involving shrunken zombie, flying spheres, portals to other dimensions, severed fingers turning into murderous insects, and other odd things.  Most everything here works, with the exception of the fight with the insect, which is painfully unconvincing.  The mini-zombies work pretty well, as they are glimpsed rarely and briefly, and they make ferocious, inhuman sounds.  They actually create menace from midget-monk-zombies; not an easy task, for sure.  The sphere itself, while it only appears briefly, is very cool.  The actual head-drilling, blood-spewing kill by the sphere is far more disturbing and far less cartoonish than I would have imagined.  Definitely nicely done.  And then there's the Tall Man himself, who's probably my favorite horror villain.  Sadly, he's not as good here as he'd be in 2 and 3, as he isn't as good at delivering his few lines.(4 in total, I believe), and isn't as old and haggard as he would look in those films.  Still, I like him a hellva lot.  Sadly, the final confrontation with the Tall Man isn't too great, but you can forgive it for faltering a bit at the end, as it was continually strong up to that point.<br /><br />The acting is hit and miss.  Each of the principal actors is noticeably bad at some point or another, but pretty passable much of the time, and, most siginificantly,  each of the main characters is very likable, despite the fact that we know so little about them.  There's even a scene at the very end of the movie which is actually pretty touching, I think.(I can't go into specifics without giving too much away, but you'll know it when you see it.)  And, as I said before, Scrimm doesn't bring his A game, but he's still a classic villain.<br /><br />This is just a very good low-budget horror film.  The DVD itself is pretty nice too, better than I would've anticipated.  Hopefully, 2 and 3 will get a region 1 DVD release before too much longer, as I like them both a lot.(I'll be branded a heretic, but I think I like 2 the best of the 3 I've seen.  I think it's even more atmospheric, as they move from one barren, wasted town to the next. But, that's for another review...)icipated.

B000065U1N|5.0|This movie seems as an answer of Ridley Scott, the director, to James Cameron, or to those who favor the latter. The story goes back to Scott's second movie, the one who made him a director you cannot choose to ignore: Alien. His huge success with that movie was somehow overshadowed when the sequel directed by Cameron gained more acclaim in States.  <br /> <br />Scott's Alien, a sci-fi thriller, was transformed into a \\"Vietnam war in space\\" movie, Aliens, by Cameron. The sequel pleased a lot the American public who were bound with Hollywood rules and who disliked and rejected Alien 3, the prison movie, a mimesis of the first one. My assumption is this fact troubled a lot Scott and pushed him to shot two movies with war scenes: Black Hawk Down and Gladiator. <br /> <br />Black Hawk Down is a war movie by all accounts, where there is uninterrupted action from the very beginning till end. No female character has a line. It depicts solely a \\"men's world\\" and does not let you think if there is an alternative one: the movie is so ridden of females that there is not even a hint of rape, or prostitution. Furthermore no efforts were made to explain the military jargon, which gives the movie a documentary atmosphere but meanwhile alienates those who do not feel at home with militaristic details. It also gives some clues about the weaknesses of post-industrial armies: no tolerance for human losses. <br /> <br />The movie got some amount of criticism about the way it treats the Somalians. It is said that they are shown just as targets and nothing has been done to express their humanity. The objective of that criticism is quite correct. However that makes the movie closer to real life experience. In modern warfare your opponent is just a target, you generally do not see his face. Black Hawk Down helps you to share the paranoia of the Rangers, for whom anything moving can be a threat. <br /> <br />As a final word, interestingly enough, in Black Hawk Down as in Troy, Eric Bana tries to cover up the troubles triggered by the inexperienced Orlando Bloom. This time he saves the day.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|What a wonderfully inventive honest and hilarious movie this was, particularly when compared to the Hollywood sap that graces our screens these days. It was unbelievably deadpan, completely orginal and right from the opening credits made of various foods, i knew it was undoubtedly one of the best movies I have seen this year. Yet totally underrated. <br /> <br />It was wonderfully acted, from Napoleon to his afeminine brother and Spanish friend to his side ponytailed love interest/friend. The entire production was graced with a 1980s air that lends itself to social commentary about the progression (or lack thereof) of rurality, and even the costumes etc are incredibly well thought out and contribute to the entire work. <br /> <br />But the point, is there is no point. Nothing is learnt, developed, and the story is hardly plot driven. Yet the entire piece works magnificantly to go absolutely nowhere, and clearly, there should be a deemphasis on the complete conclusions and perfect Hollywood stars. This film is incredibly unique and should be viewed to understand why it works so wonderfully. <br /> <br />The humour is very remincient of 'Welcome to the Dollhouse' or 'Ghost World', and yet this work is perhaps more approachable and likable.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I suspect all those who don't get this movie have never been away from home alone, especially to a foreign country, on business, as this movie captures the feeling of being lost in a crowd beautifully. You get on a plane, a nap later and you're in a completely foreign land. The transition can be very jarring. Early in the film there were repeated shots of Charlotte perching on the windowsill of her high-rise hotel room looking at a bird's-eye-view of the Tokyo cityscape. Ever done that (from a high place, or from a plane during take off or landing) and wonder how life is down there, where all the people are coming and going? You see so much but know so little. That feeling is so much more intense in a foreign country. The space and time are confused. Once work is done, everybody but you has a place to go. There's no wall, but you feel caged. You feel transitory, not belong, out of your element, out of control. You can't even drive yourself somewhere. You don't even know what's going on half of the time. That's what made Bob Harris so miserable after just a day or two. The flip side is, being free from the mundane daily obligations that take up all your time back home gives you the time to think about, and inevitably question, the direction of your life and your relationship. You put two strangers, one man, one woman, in that state of mind together, things can get interesting. Bob longs for the youthful simplicity Charlotte has, while Charlotte craves the life long wisdom Bob possesses. As in a lucid dream, you're aware of your actions, yet it feels that your actions don't matter and carry little consequences. At the end you have to wake up and go back to reality, and some times you wish that you didn't have to. Even when you do, you bring back a new perspective that would not have come to you otherwise. This movie captures that beautifully.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|I absolutely adored this movie.  I am normally not a fan of movies where everything goes completely wrong for the decent, \\"good\\" characters of the film, but this one had a meaningful plot in which hit me each and everytime something terrible happened to Tom Hanks' character and his girlfriend in their new LEMON house.  It was all about commitment.  They had every right to be screaming and yelling at each other for getting into the situation that they were in.  Yet, the didn't.  They stood by each other when the bathtub (and the bed) fell through the floor, the kitchen blew up, the roof leaked, the staircase crashed and so on.  The only thing that damaged their relationship was when Tom Hank's girlfriend told him that she slept with her ex-husband.  Which is completely understandable.  Being a woman, that would be the one thing that I couldn't forgive the man that I was with, for doing.  However, regardless of that, they realized that being together was more important than not being together.  All of this takes place as their \\"lemon\\" house is being rebuilt.  As is their relationship.  The writers of \\"The Money Pit\\" are intelligent and remarkable and have my complete confidence and respect.
0786915749|5.0|It was this book that started the Dragonlance and led to the 25 years of excellent fanasty writing.  Weis and Hickman are such a great and talent team.  When I first read this book over 15 years ago, I was blown away.  The book is actually two parts, the first part being the finding of the greatest gift and the second part being finding the leader for the greatest gift. I jsut love the relationships that were created in this first and come to life in the next parts.  I cannot say how great this book is; it is an easy read but written so well that it leaves the reader with a powerful message about good vs. evil, love and the meaning of sacrifice.  I would recommand this novel to any reader but if you are a fanasty nut, this is a must read right up there with seeing the Star Wars Trilogy or reading the Lord of the Rings.
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|If you read the book , and it were used for this movie, then it would be worthy of an Academy Award. Unfortunately , we are left with a paltry attempt at a sequel that just doesn't equal the first version. This could have been a terrific film if it weren't so \\"jumpy\\". It appears that the camera work was done on an amusement ride , even though this may have been used to help with the action. This is not worthy of the money to purchase this film but Jason Bourne character could have been the next Bond if there were a better story line and directing.

6302636779|5.0|The Nun's Story is the true story of Marie-Louise Habets, who entered a convent in Belgium in 1927 and was laicized in the middle of the Second World War. She undergoes the strict spiritual formation of a nun, spends years in missionary work, has a nearly-miraculous cure from TB in the Congo, only to find that she cannot reconcile her religious obligations to her sense of medical duty, and her Christian requirement to love her enemy with an atavistic loathing of the Nazis. It needs to be emphasized that the story takes place in a different cultural and temporal milieu than today's.  For one thing, the idea of bringing the \\"benighted savages\\" of the Congo to Christ as a way of \\"improving\\" them has now become very outmoded, as has the whole idea of colonialism. <br /> <br />Times, and the Catholic Church, have changed a good deal since Sister Luke became a religious.  Only the most reclusive, contemplative orders today insist on the kind of spiritual exercises described in the book.  Vatican II changed a lot.  Correspondingly the number of young women entering convents has dropped dramatically.  At the time the film was made, the Vatican was quite hostile to it, and yet the film is highly spiritual, and Sister Luke's struggles are actually a marvellous exposition of the true Christian and highly spiritual personality. <br /> <br />Some have written that they would have liked a \\"happier\\" ending, with Sister Luke marrying Dr. Fortunati, or \\"rediscovering\\" her faith.  In the event, in reality, neither happened. Ms. Habets was discovered by the author of \\"The Nun's Story\\" in a displaced persons' camp, where she was nursing the inmates, and the two women lived together thereafter--Ms. Hulme, the author, eventually converting to Catholicism.  That indicates to me that \\"Sister Luke\\" never lost her faith in God, but only in the way the convent insisted one approach Him. In my opinion, she was a highly religious person. <br /> <br />I think the film is faithful to the book, ifnot as detailed.  Audrey Hepburn always thought it was one of her best films--although she is reported to have said that she should have insisted, to show the passage of time, that her hair have some grey in it when she left the convent. <br /> <br />I'm Jewish, but this film has always been very inspiring to me, maybe because I'm a nurse as well, and understand the vocational aspect of my profession. <br /> <br />Audrey Hepburn is supported by an excellent cast of fine British repertory actors.  I wish the film would come out in DVD.
B000002G87|5.0|Imagine you are Eric Clapton in 1970. Your best friend's wife has gone and made the moves on you- whoops, you fall in love. She didn't mean for that to happen. It's not like you were the only one she was cheating on her husband with...    Anyways, you figure that the best way to win her heart is to let her know via song. You take three guys you've met through earlier session work- Whitlock, Radle and Gordon- and get on down to Miami for a fortnight or so to lay down your testament on tape, using originals and covers to convey the message.    You are soon joined by a fifth, the elder brother Allman, who breathes life into the sessions, doing among other things re-interpreting an old Bessie Smith number for you and turning that soft ballad you wrote, \\"Layla\\", into a tour de force, a true number for the ages.     The sessions wrap, and you traverse around Miami, finding a left-handed white Stratocaster, perfect for your friend Jimi, who's over in England, resting. You've brought an acetate of your group's cover of his \\"Little Wing\\", which is going on the album. By the time you find out where he is, to play the acetate and give the guitar, he's up and died.     The album's done, and out on the shelves in December. There's little publicity, it lays dormant for two years or more. Worst of all, your friend's wife ignores it. It's got to be heartbreaking.    You try to get the group back together, sans Allman, in early '71, but whatever magic that had been there is gone. Allman and you never get a chance to work together again- he's dead on October 29, '71. Radle will eventually come back, but you'll probably have something to do with his 1980 death (you fired him the year prior.) Gordon goes schizo, kills his mother, and threatens to kill you. Whitlock goes into obscurity, and remains there. You do get your best friend's wife, years after the fact, but you lose her due to your various weaknesses.      Thirty-four years after this album was done, everybody knows who you are. The album was found belatedly, and is now cherished by most for the ages, hopefully for much more than its title track. Thanks, Eric.
B00005KARK|5.0|This movie might be old but it's the best old movie I've ever seen. It's sad when Dumbo has his mother taken away from him and it's heart-warming when he sets out to find her. The mouse who becomes Dumbo's friend is funny. The most defining part of the movie that compelled me to buy it was when Dumbo's mother rocks him in her trunk and all the other baby animals are cuddling with their mothers. That part is so cute. You're truly a Disney fan if you like this movie!
B000089RVX|5.0|I've had this CD for about a year, and I've loved it ever since! Each track is awesome!!! The haunting voice of Amy Lee and the guitars together sounds eerie, but totally cool. I think that this group is so unique in its sound, and the lyrics, which by the way are the best. All of the lyrics describe things that teenagers go through. I rated each song (out of 10) the following: <br /> <br />1. Going Under: 10/10 <br /> <br />2. Bring Me Life: 10/10 <br /> <br />3. Everybody's Fool: 10/10 <br /> <br />4. My Immortal: 10/10 <br /> <br />5. Haunted: 10/10 <br /> <br />6. Tourniquet: 7/10 <br /> <br />7. Imaginary: 9/10 <br /> <br />8. Taking Over Me: 9/10 <br /> <br />9. Hello: 5/10 <br /> <br />10. My Last Breath: 8/10 <br /> <br />11. Whisper: 10/10 <br /> <br />If you are wondering whether to buy this album or not, you really should buy it! You will enjoy it forever!
B00006879E|4.0|I can relate to a lot of the songs on this CD. I think it's great when people can relate to the music that they listen to because it gives you a sense of support. These songs are just great and they really touch on sensitive sujects that most every other artist sings about, but Maroon 5 does this in more creative, poetic ways. My favorite songs are: harder to breath, this love, she will be loved, must get out, and sunday morning. I'm actually listening to the CD as I type, and I'm positive that it's well worth every dollar I paid for it :)
0393035158|5.0|Harris has the courage to tell the truth: 1) Bin Laden and his admirers are not on the fringe of Islam, and Islam is not a religion of peace; 2) the modern, democratic West is in a struggle to the death with Islam, whose adherents will not stop until they have imposed a Taliban type dictatorship on the world, and if they have to kill all \\"infidels\\" they will do it; 3) we can pretend otherwise and lose this war, or face reality and fight back; 4) pacificism and moral relativism are  cowardly responses, and the deconstructionist types are engaged in mental masturbation 5) Christianity and Judaism are also outmoded belief systems that only survive b/c believers can hold inconsistent ideas in their heads, but, then still have enough poisonous beliefs that they encourage adherents to focus on trivial \\"sins\\" such as adultery, homosexuality, petty drug abuse, etc., and miss the big picture; 6) Christianity and Judaism are not as virulent today as they were in the Middle Ages b/c of the advances of science, reason, and democracy, that has left the Western religions a matter mostly of going to church on Sunday, then living by factual knowledge the rest of the week, but they still are dangerous; when you consider that Reagan invited Falwell to National Security Council meetings to brief policy makers on the coming Armageddon, and our current president encourages prayer meetings and Bible studies and talks to \\"his Father,\\" about affairs of state and war; 7) the monotheistic religions are primitive and based on speculation, myth, and tradition, maybe with some psychosis mixed in,  reinforced by centuries of oppression that stamped out competing world views (Inquistion; Calvin's torture and murder of Michael Servetus for questioning the doctrine of the Trinity; Henry VIII's torture and murder of a scholar for translating the Bible to English); 8) the three big monotheist religions all claim title to the same little piece of real estate, and all believe they are the one true religion, which accounts for the never ending strife in the Middle East, and 9/11, and such barbarities as decapitating Daniel Pearl, and now there is the imminent risk the Moslem fanatics will get their hands on nuclear weapons;      <br />8) certain Eastern forms of spirituality, particularly Mahayana Buddhism are based in observation and experimentation that 9) engender compassion for all sentient being, and are based on reason, honesty, and love; 10) spirituality is a positive force, if based on reason and ethics as exemplified by the Buddha and his spiritual/intellectual descendants. Most importantly, religion should not be exempt from critical analysis and discourse; if it can't hold up, then it's time for it to go the way of the \\"knowlege\\" about anything else in the time the Bible and Koran were written like reading chicken guts. Harris writes beautifully; in one quote he says that the Dalai Lama discussing spirituality with the Pope and, say Jerry Falwell,  is comparable to Einstein discussing physics with a bunch of Kalahari bushmen. Harris is trained as a philospher and neuroscientist.  The book is highly readable. He includes extensive endnotes with citations for more indepth study. I loved this book. People who like Eckhardt Tolle, the Dalai Lama, Suzuki, and also scientists such as Edward O. Wilson and Richard Dawkins will enjoy it and be stimulated.  Christian fundamentalists will love the sections on Islam. Moslems will hate the whole thing.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|Man, Blade 1 sucked big time so I imagined this movie would be just as bad. Turns out I was wrong. Upon finding out that the first actress who played 'Marta' in the hit comedy Arrested Development was in this movie with a big role, I thought to myself ok I'll buy it. I got it as a gift for my 20th birthday and watched it two weeks later and man, the action is so cool and it's better than it's predacessor Blade I in a landslide. Wesley was his usual bad ass self beating the hell outta vampires. But Wesley is not my favorite character here. He's a close second. The first Marta, who is played by Leonor Varela is. She plays Nyssa, Blade's love interest, and man does she look hot in all that leather. She is one of the few Bloodpack members that actually respects Blade. For the exception of her and the guy with cornrows, I didn't like the rest of The Bloodpack and Norman Reedus with a complete waste. But the movie is so good because of Blade, Nyssa, and Whistler. Don't hate on Blade II because it's off the chain from start to end!

0743424425|5.0|Twenty-seven years after its publication, The Shining remains a visceral, gripping read that showcases Stephen King's unfathomable powers to hypnotize and terrify readers, a power King had in abundance in the early stages of his career.  Coming on the heels of Carrie and 'Salem's Lot, The Shining truly established King as a modern master of horror and an unequaled purveyor of a literary mirror into pop culture.  If you've only seen the original movie starring Jack Nicholson, you really owe it to yourself to read the novel; Stanley Kubrick made a fine and scary movie, but he did not capture the essence of King's story, and his dramatization followed a different path than what you find in the original vision brought to life through the words of King.  The more recent miniseries was more faithful to the novel, but it doesn't take an Einstein to figure out that a made-for-TV dramatization is limited in terms of what it can get away with in a number of important areas.  Simply put, The Shining stands just behind Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House as one of the best \\"haunted house\\" novels ever written.<br /><br />The plot should be quite familiar to one and all by this point.  The Torrance family embarks on a months-long retreat into complete isolation when Jack Torrance signs on to be the winter custodian of the Overlook Hotel in Colorado.  Jack takes some personal demons with him to a hotel chock-full of malevolent, ghostly spirits; he is a recovering alcoholic who, in the last couple of years, lost his job and broke his little boy's arm in a state of drunken fury.  He thinks the months alone with his wife and son will allow him to find peace - and to finally finish the play he has been working on.  His long-suffering wife has some misgivings, but the only person really clued into the dreadful possibilities is his son Danny.  Danny has \\"the shine,\\" a gift which allows him to see and know things he cannot possibly know; it is a powerful gift which the Overlook (which really is an entity unto itself) jealously desires for itself.<br /><br />As the days pass, the Overlook exerts more and more of an influence on Jack, exploiting his weaknesses, exacerbating his paranoia and persecution complex, and basically turning him into a murderous new tool at the hotel's disposal.  Danny sees what is happening, although he cannot really understand much of it given his very young age.  He can certainly understand the terror of the Overlook, however, as he sees images of the hotel's murderous past and very dark near future in a number of unsettling scenes interspersed throughout the novel.  This is a harrowing tale of survival against incredible odds of a supernatural nature, and King brings every nuance of the story to vivid life, capturing perfectly the internalization and externalization of fear among exceedingly real, believable characters that the reader gets to know very well indeed.  As has always been the case with Stephen King, it is his incomparable powers of characterization that make the supernatural elements of his story work so amazingly well.  You can't help but be emotionally committed to these characters.<br /><br />The Shining really isn't one of my all-time favorite Stephen King novels, but it is exceedingly well crafted and features some of the most harrowing scenes to be found in King's immense body of work.  Even though I had read the novel before and was quite familiar with the story in both its literary and cinematic manifestations, I was completely caught up in the story as I re-read it - to the point that I found myself flipping the pages faster than I normally do for a novel completely new to me.

B00005JNEI|5.0|After I heard from some people in the media that this movie was all lies I watched it, because quite often in such situations the persons saying it never saw the movie, or did and lie to keep others from watching it.  I heard statements that BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is an anti-gun movie, when actually it is an exploration of the conditions in our society that make violent crime so high. Incidently, Michael Moore is a member of the NRA himself.  <br /> <br />In Fahrenheit 9/11, Michael Moore does make statements that are hard to believe. Still, it is worth it for every person to watch and think for themselves. Why did some documents released from Bush's guard duty days have names blotted out, and what connection did the persons with these names have to the Bushes and the oil industry? What connection has there been with them and the Bush family in the past few years?   What is this nonsense about a \\"Coaltion of the Willing\\"? Truthfully most of the countries listed in this coalition participate little but in name.   Why aren't GWB's children, members of Congress, or rich kids fighting this war instead of kids from the lower and middle classes? These are some of the key things to get out of this video.  <br /> <br />Michael Moore was one of few persons with the guts to question motives for this war before it started.  He was right, there was no WMD. Since he was right his opinions should be heard.  Watch this movie and BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE.  Both movies make you think, which is what those idiots that say these movies are trash don't want you to do.
B00005JMXX|5.0|Dennis Quaid stars as climatologist Jack Hall in this spectacular thriller about the effects of global warming on the Earth.  Due to the rapid warming, the polar ice caps begin to split, hail the size of softballs begins to fall in Tokyo, huge tornadoes are spawned over Los Angeles, and a tidal wave with waves as high as the Statue of Liberty engulf New York City.  The after-effects of the storms are perhaps the most catastrophic, as temperature drops of as much as ten degrees per second occur, instantly freezing anyone who ventures outside. <br /> <br />Jack's son Sam, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is in New York City participating in a scholastic competition when the weather starts to change.  Cut off from escape, Sam and a band of fellow survivors take refuge from the tidal wave and ensuing temperature drops and snowfall inside the New York public library.  They survive by burning books inside an old fireplace and eating chips and candy from vending machines.  But, with nowhere to go and no one to rescue them, will they survive or will they all perish from the bitter cold?  Will Jack make it to rescue his son before its too late?  What will become of the people in the southern United States who were evacuated to Mexico? <br /> <br />I'm a big fan of special effects in movies, and this film has some of the best effects I've ever seen before.  Perhaps the best scene of the film is the formation of the tidal wave that slams into New York City.  Watching this wave form and ultimately engulf the Statue of Liberty, which stands well over 800 feet tall, was one of the high points in the movie for me.  The tornado sequences over Los Angeles, and the opening scenes of the fissure cracks at the poles were excellent as well.  Dennis Quaid , Jake Gyllenhaal, and the rest of the cast give top notch performances.  I highly recommend this action-packed movie.  The special effects will blow you away, and the thrilling story will keep you captivated throughout.
B000003TA4|1.0|...to see Burt Kocain finally getting the credit he deserves.  He has greatly been accredited for killing the true essance of rock n roll...and I have to agree with that.  This album is not uplifting at all, and it doesn't rock in the least bit.  He is a horrible singer/guitar player.  Any of you Nirvana fans should really open your eyes to other great and talented bands out there i.e. Zeppelin, Whitesnake, Hendrix, OZZY, Guns 'N f**king Roses, Van Halen!!!  Eddie Van Halen would blow Burt Kocain's guitar playing away with his pinky finger alone!Nirvana is straight garbage!!!  DEATH TO NIRVANA!!!  You all may say i'm wasting my time posting this, but I'm a musician myself, and I'm sick and tired of this garbage ass band getting so much props when they didn't do anything for music except make it ok not to have actual musical talent starting in '91 til the present.
B000294SFW|5.0|If you haven't heard Motorhead, or are only familiar with the song \\"Ace of Spades\\", then go get yourself any of their last 5 albums.  With new drummer Mikee Dee, they have upped the intensity, volume, speed, and heaviness ten fold from the first 15 years worth of albums, they just keep getting heavier. And the songs are just as catchy, because Lemmy is of course still writing like a madman.  Talk about consistency, one can only aspire to have a  single career that lasts 30 years, and you find yourself sticking it to the Man with full-throttle rock-n-roll as you approach the age of 60.  These last 5 alubs are like a different band, and while varied all drive home the heavy boogies like nobody since Chuck Berry. <br /> <br />\\"Inferno\\" is a great Motorhead album.  Its a little different than the last 3 albums (We Are Motorhead, Snakebite Love, Overnight Sensation), it is closer to the Sacrifice album.  These last 5 albums are just altogether heavier and faster and everything louder than everything else.  I think the song-writing quality is just as high as the last few albums, but Inferno belts our a few inches more riffs per song, than any album since Sacrifice.  <br /> Motorhead still kick in your ears live, too.  They are even better live now than ever before!  <br /> In almost 30 years of rocking, Motorhead has only put out 1 album that I didn't like as much as all the others, and \\"Another Perfect Day\\" is till better than any of the nu-metal crap on the rock-radio today.  MOTORHEAD RULES!!!
B0002I831S|3.0|It was always the case when the original two-episode DVD's were released that Paramount would eventually release Star Trek as a boxed set. This was reinforced when The Next Generation was released as season sets. So, now we have The Original Series Season 1, and as you may have read already, there's some very mixed reviews as to whether it's worth your hard earned dollars to buy. <br /> <br />So, being upfront, I'm not really a huge Trek fan. I've enjoyed Star Trek ever since I was a kid, but I don't go much beyond that, and so it was pretty hard going to stump up the $85 to buy this box set - and that's after a 25% plus discount. Ouch.  <br /> <br />After coughing up my hard earned cash, I was eager to find out exactly what I got for my money. Well, the answer is every episode - minus the pilot - from the original Season One. I'm not quite sure why the pilot is missing. It would seem logical to include it in the set. <br /> <br />Now unlike some others, I'm not bothered how they are ordered, or whether they are in airdate, or production date. I just want to know if they look good, and have good quality sound. And the answer to both of those questions is yes and yes. It's pretty clear that they haven't been restored by a dedicated team, but for what it's worth, the image quality is still pretty good with vibrant colors in some of the episodes, and on the whole good contrast, and a clear, well defined image. Audio wise, there's two soundtracks, one is a remastered Surround version, and the other mono. I always listen to the original mono - I guess I'm a traditionalist. There are no audio commentaries, which is a great shame. <br /> <br />There's a single extras CD, which apparently has a few featurettes and the like, but I have yet to really take a look at it. There's also a very poor quality insert that briefly describes each episode, and that's about it. No production notes, or anything like that. <br /> <br />The packaging, while on the outside looks good, is actually a huge letdown. On the individual cases, rather than use a push-style release for each DVD disc, Paramount have used horrible, cheap looking plastic cases, where the DVD is literally locked in place, and you end up bending the disc to get it free. No doubt, bending the DVD's reduces the lifespan, and you'll end up after a few years with a season box set that no longer plays. My advice? Get rid of the awful plastic case, and use after-market ones. Or, make a backup copy and use those for general viewing. <br /> <br />All in all, it's a shame that Paramount feel that they can charge so much, for what is - at the end of the day - just another 1960's TV program. If it was anything else, you'd pay $50-60, but because it's Star Trek, you pay double that. When you consider the lack of extras such as commentaries and - outside of the gold plastic case - poor quality interior packaging, in the end it all feels like a real letdown.
B000002H3E|5.0|The pure and unblemished MAGIC that was Dokken in te 80's is unsurpassed. THIS is a band that could write a song with ALL the right ingredients - a KILLER hook, shredding solos, \\"in-your-face\\" bass, and a COWBELL. MAN, how KILLER is a cowbell in a rock song??? Am i right or am i wrong?<br /><br />You NEED this CD.
B000002INR|5.0|Skid Row came into the music scene towards the end of the 80's,shortly before the era of metal and hard rock ended. Skid Row was diffently one of the finest bands of that era. Where most the metal bands at the time were more pop than metal,the boys in Skid Row rocked pretty hard.With the combination of rockin' vocals from Sebastian Bach and the high quality of song writing Skid Row became a hit. The album may sound a bit dated know, but songs like Big Guns,Sweet Little Sister,18 and Life,Youth Gone Wild, and I Remember You still sound great coming out of the radio today.While their popularity only lasted a couple of years before Alternative came along Skid Row is a band not to be missed.
B00005JMH2|5.0|Shall We Dance is a new film from director Peter Chelsom. Chelsom did very good getting the cast that he did. Richard Gere, J.Lo, Susan Sarandon, some bluecollared girl with a giant a*s, Nick Cannon, Mya and some more people that you feel \\"Darn it! I know who that is, but what is that person's name?\\" <br />This is a simply beautiful film. An artsy movie with romance, tons of funny scenes, charming characters/actors and a compelling storyline that has alot of character development. <br /> <br />If you haven't heard, this is a movie based on its Japanese original. That one was a little different, because in Japan, touching a woman somewhere was offensive. So, for a man to dance in a jazz club, it would be socially unnaceptable. So, obviously, it's not as much developing as the characters, so to speak. Because many men in America these days dance and they don't think of it that way as they would in Japan. <br /> <br />Well, the story is about a man from New York who spends all day working and all night worrying about it. He notices 'Miss Mitzi's Dance Studio'. So, after a long consideration, he decides to go for classes. He notices that Jennifer Lopez is only the assisstant. So, this dance thing gets to his head, he is never around, so his wife suspects he's having an affair with this J.Lo woman. So, she hires a wise-cracking dectective to spy on him. I won't tell you any more. <br /> <br />Overall: Shall We Dance is a light, pleasing romantic comedy with alot of good.
B000002GB6|5.0|This album is the most famous Chuck Mangione album, and one of his best. His beautiful flugelhorn playing, his magnificent leadership, and his brilliant song writing skills all make this album a true masterpiece. Everything in this album flows! Mangione clearly knew how to write music with feeling, and boy could he play! His band, sure had something to do with the magic of this album. <br />Chris Vadala: <br />On tenor and soprano saxophones, alto, and c flutes, and piccolo. He is without a doubt, one of the best reedists Mangione ever had in his band lineup. Gerry Neiwood was the other master! Chris Vadala's playing is so unique and his sound is extraudinary, and soulful. His magic adds so much more to the music of this album. His solo on Feels So Good is magnificent. I still find myself humming it over and over, hours after I've played it.  <br />Grant Geissman: <br />On acoustic, electric, classical, and 12 string guitars, Grant Geissman, just might of played one of the greatest guitar solos in jazz history. Yes, you guessed it; the solo on Feels So Good. It's a wonder, he didn't spend hours and hours working it out, since it's so melodic.  <br />Charles Meeks: <br />Funky, \\"Meet Man\\" Meeks. One of the grooviest bass players ever! He adds some hippness to the album.  <br />James Bradley Jr: <br />Every drummer should learn from this master. Although some might not call him a master at this time, because he was only 18 years old. Well accomplished, who had a role in Cool Hand Luke when he was 7, was a child prodigy on the drums. He cools it down a little bit, on this album, but makes up for it, in color. Some nice conga playing on 11th Commandment. <br />The first song, Feels So Good, is Mangione's classic! Still, after 25 years, it's still loved by pop and jazz fans alike.  <br />Here, the way it originally was issued, the full 9 minute version. With the edited version, so much magic was lost, and until this day, gone forever. Next up, Maui Waui. One of the mostmelodic songs ever; Chris Vadala's flute playing adds to the warmth and beauty of the piece. Theme From Side Street, is one of the greatest songs by Mangione, ever! The melody, the hook, the groove, it's all there. Number 4 is, Hide And Seek. Another classic. Great solos by all! I particularly love Vadala's soprano solo, and Geissman's guitar solo. Last Dance, is another pretty piece. It has a beautiful acoutsic guitar solo, by Grant Geissman. The last piece, 11th Commandment; another classic. Charles Meeks, and James Bradley Jr. are featured soloists here. Meeks's bass solo is really blusey and down to earth. After some splap bass by Meeks, the piece picks up. James Bradley Jr's solo is perfect for this particular piece. Not too over powering, not at all, boring, just right! This is a classic album, and is still enjoyed by many. This album put Mangione on the map, and if you enjoy any fusion, or early contemporary jazz, you'll love Mangione's music!
B000002U82|4.0|While NOT the best stuff ever recorded, Dark Side may be the best stuff Pink Floyd ever got down.  This one flows.  There is a common theme that resurfaces throughout the album in such songs as \\"Breathe\\" and \\"Any Colour You Like\\", making it a lot like a musical, a la The Wall, which is also good times.
0792835077|4.0|<br />I picked this film up about a week ago. I hadn't seen it since it premiered back in the 1970's. It made no impression on me whatsoever on that first viewing. Boy has time and its simplicity improved it, the second time around! This is a very timely film and I think people of all ages should take a look at it. <br /> <br />This film moves from humour to fantasy to horror almost seamlessly. And the funny thing is- the fact that Crichton didn't get caught up in atmosphere or look; he concentrated on two characters simply going to a future resort, however fantastic the idea seems, to release and experience what in fact become examples of some of the darkest pleasures or most violent impulses inside of all of us. It really presses the right buttons and asks questions about what we find fun or entertaining. <br /> <br />I don't want any review I write to spoil the films for the people yet to see the work so, let's just say- when the tables turn and 'we're on the receiving end ', there's a real numbing truth to what this film drives home. More so today then when it was released. Think of some of the 'reality based darkness' that now litters our airwaves and the unfortunate numbers who seem to be tuning in to watch it. <br /> <br />James Brolin really nails the 'who cares' feel his character needs. Richard Benjamin has to be the one who feels silly at first, then joins in with a sort of reckless abandon. And Yul Brynner is an example to everybody today (in acting, directing, effects and make-up ), of how you can scare the hell out of someone with a look, a smile and two small silver contact lens. (You'll know what I mean when you get to the scene). Benjamin really balances him from that point, having to portray the fear the new reality hits him with. <br /> <br />I won't do the Jurassic comparisons. I thought it when Jurassic came out but Jurassic was a rollercoaster ride. Westworld is the tale with the real bite. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this movie. It's an entertainment that quickly turns to a truth I think we all need to keep thinking about. What do we really find entertaining? Or more to the point... why?

B00005AQE8|5.0|[...]2Pac is tha best rapper of all time, he blew mobb deep and bad boy out of the water, and he still does.  Hit em Up aint weak either.  Anyway All Eyez On Me is the sickest rap album ever, every song is good, beats are great, lyrics are deep, and the guest apperances on this album is off da hook.  The magazine \\"Rolling Stone\\" once ranked All Eyez On Me the best hip-hop album.  This album is without a doubt a classic.    Best Songs:  Picture Me Rollin  Ambitionz Az A Ridah  How Do U Want It  2 Of Americaz Most Wanted  Thug Passion  California Luv  Tradin War Stories    If ur a pac fan and u dont have this CD u shouldn't consider yourself a pac fan.         P.S. If 2Pac was still alive he'd be dissin these punkass new rappers like 50 Cent, Ja Rule, Nelly, Llyod Banks, T.I. and the rest of em.  O ya he'd still be dissin NAS, Mobb Deep, and Bad Boy records.    There are a few Biggie and east coast fans writin reviews just to diss Pac and say how much better Biggie is than him.  First of all don't u guys have anything better too do with ur spare time.  Pac is better anywayz, ur just jealous cuz Pac dissed Bad Boy and Mobb Deep real bad on Hit Em Up.  But quit dissin Pac in album reviews on here.  Especially u eastsidenugga.  Ya i'm callin u out biatch.  I can give u the whole, true story on the Biggie Pac thing.  I mean ya Biggie had talent, but he only had 2 albums (1 when he was alive).  If u really want me to, I'll go and start dissin Biggie and Mobb Deep on album reviews.  But fo real, y u gotta go dis 2Pac in album reviews just to try and persuade people to jump on Biggie's and Mobb Deep's band wagon wit u.  U keep writin positive reviews for Bad Boy and Mobb Deep and quit dissin Pac in his own reviews and I'll quit retaliatin to ur reviews.  O ya 1 more thing:  \\"Now when I say Pig, You say B-I-G, When I say BadBoy Killa, Then you say ME, When I say Puffy is a punk, You scream word on my life, I wrote this sh*t while f*cking Bigs wife.\\" plus puffy tryin to see meweak hearts i rip biggie smalls and junior mafia some mark a** b*tches- R.I.P Tupac Shakur
B00005Q4CS|2.0|This movie was absolutely ridiculous.  I thought it was a comedy, what with the fridge monster and all.  The film really didn't bring much to the table as far as social commentary is concerned. That is to say that I've personally seen much worse...I guess living in Wisconsin, you get more livestock than you do real life experience, huh deadsummer?
B0001MDQ6W|5.0|In the blackest of sunglasses and a polka dot shirt, Dylan, and his musicians, are fabulous in this concert taped in Sony Music Studios on November of 1994, in an intimate setting with a small but enthusiastic audience.<br /><br />From the mellow country feel of \\"Shooting Star\\", the up-tempo \\"Dignity\\", or the somber \\"With God on Our Side\\", the musicianship is a marvel, and being a \\"nobody sings Dylan like Dylan\\" person, I love the way he sings his music with his gravelly voice that gets rougher as the years go by.<br /><br />The acoustic instruments are a pleasure to listen to, as well as a visual delight, especially the gleaming rich wood of the double bass.<br /><br />This disc contains 4 tracks that were not included in the MTV Unplugged broadcast (# 1, 5, 6 and 8), and total running time is 73 minutes.<br /><br />The terrific musicians are: Tony Garnier on bass, Bucky Baxter on dobro, Winston Watson on drums, John Jackson on guitar and Brendan O'Brien on organ.<br /><br />Track list with original release album dates:<br /><br />1: \\"Tombstone Blues\\" (Highway 61 Revisited '65)<br /><br />2: \\"Shooting Star\\" (Oh Mercy '89)<br /><br />3: \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" (John Wesley Harding '67)<br /><br />4: \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\" (The Times They Are A-Changin' '64)<br /><br />5: \\"John Brown\\" (MTV Unplugged '94)<br /><br />6: \\"Desolation Row\\" (Highway 61 Revisited '65)<br /><br />7: Rainy Day Women # 12 & 35\\" (Blonde on Blonde '66)<br /><br />8: \\"Love Minus Zero / No Limit\\" (Bringing it All Back Home '65)<br /><br />9: \\"Dignity\\" (Greatest Hits Vol. 3 '94)<br /><br />10: \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\" (Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid '73)<br /><br />11: \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" (Highway 61 Revisited '65)<br /><br />12: \\"With God on Our Side\\" (The Times They Are A-Changin' '64)
0671027344|3.0|This book is written, as a series of letters to a person only known as \\"Friend\\", by a young teenager.  Because Chbosky has selected this as the framework of this novel, the writing style is understandably--sometimes annoyingly--simple, and it reads, well, just how a teenage boy would talk if he was relating a story to you.  Therefore, there is no prose.  It's pretty accurate, from what I can remember about being a teenage boy, yet it's also somewhat predictable.  I enjoyed this book enough to finish it, and there are lots of interesting parts--I think Chbosky somehow got all the important parts of a story in there by accident, but they're there.    I suggest this book to those who just need a break from whatever their \\"usual\\" is, be it horror, classic, or subversive-whatever-books.  It's different, it's quick.  It's neither terrible nor great.

B000065U1N|5.0|Black Hawk Down is one of my favourite war movies. Right next to Saving Private Ryan. The story is about a group of American Rangers who supposed to kill a Somalian gangster in a short mission. But something goes wrong and that results in a long fight with lots of victims. I also have to mention, that I noticed quite solid performance by Josh Hartnett in this movie, by the way. So, if you enjoy watching war movies, this movie is almost necessary.
B000099T2L|4.0|My overall favorite tracks would have to be: <br /> <br />Crazy In Love - The whole \\"bootybounce\\" thing was really overrated, and even though he's a really talented artist, Jay-Z's rap almost put me to sleep. But we're here for Beyonce, and she dominated this song. Good job. <br /> <br />Baby Boy - This song was right on time with the sudden rise in reggae/pop crossover thing. Good timing. Really good timing. <br /> <br />Me, Myself, and I - Eh, its fairly decent. She's a good singer, so she makes it sound good. The lyrics suck @$$ though. <br /> <br />Speechless - Unless you've been laid, you wouldn't understand how good this song is. Brings back fond memories. Good job. <br /> <br />The Closer I Get To You - Awesome collaboration. Not oversung, and \\"Loofah\\" still has an awesome voice. The two of them together blended well. <br /> <br />Tracks that I Didn't Bother to Download: <br /> <br />Hip Hop Star - DEAR JESUS?! What is this $h!t?!? OutKast and Beyonce are all really good artists, but they just don't mix. This song is over-rapped. <br /> <br />The rest of the songs are okay, so I just skip over them if I'm really listening to the CD. Overall, Beyonce is a really talented artist, so she gets my vote. Keep up the good work.
B00003CX95|5.0|We all know the story, but still. It is about William Wallace, a Scot, who's father was killed by the English. Later also his wife is killed. He decides to revenge them both and also bring freedom to the Scotish people. He almost suceeds, but he is caught by unfair means and sentenced to death. His last word before death are: ''Freeedooom!!!'' After his death, his mission to bring freedom to the Scots was achieved by his people lead by Robert the Bruce. The famous words: In the year of our lord thirteen fourteen, patriots of Scotland, starving and outnumbered, charged the fields of Bannockburn. They fought like warrior poets. They fought like Scotsmen. And won their freedom.
B00000I07Q|5.0|This was the first Bon Jovi I got to hear when I bought it in Feb. of 1989.  It still is a solid rock album all throughout, rockers and their familiar power ballads.  I didn't think that they would top Slippery When Wet, but this album is just as entertaining as well as rocking.  Blood on Blood is very Springsteen-ish, kind of like Born To Run, but very well done. The opening song makes you feel like you're in a concert, in a stadium of over 50,000 people screaming, with Lay Your Hands on Me!  I still love Bad Medicine and Tico Torres' incredible drum playing on it.  Especially on the last two lines before the last chorus where he hits those drums hard 8 times, then the bottom part where he hits the snare 5 times!!!! I turn up the volume or bang on the table every time that part comes up in that song.  On several cuts, Jon Bon Jovi in a rare move was hitting some very high notes, which come out so very impressive! I don't know of any other male singer who can hit those notes so high like that!  And this was two years before Mariah Carey's first album came out that Jon Bon Jovi was doing this high note approach. It's the high point of this album every time I hear I'll Be There For You and Living in Sin. Other songs I like, Born to Be My Baby and its familiar sing along chorus, Stick To Your Guns, Wild Is The Wind, the rocking final song with 99 in the title and others.  Jon as well as Richie Sambora wrote some very solid songs this time, perhaps the best in their band's music career.  And David Bryan's keyboard playing still blends well with Sambora and Alec Jon Such's lead guitars and Tico's drumming!  Jon sounds so versatile vocally in all the songs here. One of my favorite albums and it justifies in that album title that they're proud to be from New Jersey! They really prove why that state can produce such very multitalented music artists from Springsteen to Sinatra to Whitney to Dionne to even them too and many others!
0689862725|5.0|The tale begins when Trisha, 9 and her older brother Peter are taken by their divorced mother on a hiking trip along the Appalachian Trail. Mother and son argue the entire ride up (mainly about their living arrangements) and then continue the bickering on the trail. Trisha announces her need to use the bathroom, although mother and son are too busy arguing to even hear her.<br /><br />Assuming it's okay, Trisha wanders off in search of a remote spot. What happens next is every parent's worst nightmare. Trisha determined to have some quiet time, instead of listening to the bickering decides to take a shortcut to end the expedition quicker. Though things don't work out as planned, and Trisha accidentally gets lost.<br /><br />Amongst the wilderness, fear sets in, giving way to auditory hallucinations as well as visual ones. Trisha carries in her backpack, an egg, a tuna sandwich, a soda (lime), a bottle of water, celery sticks, 2 Twinkies, and a Walkman. To distract herself she focuses on baseball, especially her favorite closing pitcher, Tom Gordon.<br /><br />Trisha's survival skills are put to the test day after day, as she struggles to manage alone in the woods for a week! She does so buy eating raw fish, berries, nuts, then drinking from ponds, and puddles - once her own supplies have run out.<br /><br />The question is: How many nine-year-olds could survive such a traumatic event?<br /><br />Stephen King has done a wonderful job with this book, and the illustrations certainly helped bring his words to life. There are subtle symbolisms that address issues like religion and self-realization. Children of all ages are sure to love this spooky-adventurous tale-- I know I did!<br /><br />Reviewed by Betsie
0393035158|1.0|Hi <br /> <br />I love it when I see reviews saying they commend this authors' courage and so forth......actually bashing religion is quite fashionable this day and age so courage has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br />I have never met an athiest who wasn't a moral coward....By the the way Buddest thought is athiestic thought in it's purest form. <br /> <br />every argument against religion is the same old utopian crap that that people like marx and others have foisted on the ignorant of the world as truth from the get go..... <br />PHD's don't always reflect real intellect.....this simplistic Drivel is proof positive of that. <br /> <br />
B00006690G|4.0|although i miss teh days of ol Slim Shady, \\"The Eminem Show\\" wasnt half way bad, very good cd. too bad mista madders gets a bad rep from 17 year old wiggers everywhere.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Kill Bill: Volume 2 is a good movie. I found that this volume seemed to have more action than the first. Although, she doesn't kill over a hundred people at one time in this volume, she does kick butt. I think the best part is seeing the training and when she defends him by defeating her enemy, but the truly best part is the end. I won't give the end, but I feel sorry that Bill didn't know all the things she was taught.
B0000WN0ZK|4.0|I just read an article at DVDbeaver re: this disc and the censoring of a couple of images of female nudity. Although the article claims that this censorship (cropping of the image, use of digital blurring) is only found on the Region 1/4 disc, I discovered - when looking at my exclusive region 1 disc - that, while there is no digital masking, the shot of Vanessa Redgrave has been cropped to remove her [vital organs]. I'm not necessarily suggesting that this is a reason to avoid purchasing this disc - unless you only wanted it for this reason! - but I do find such censorship disturbing. Buyer beware!
B00000K3CM|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I have it on vhs, but I'm also getting it on dvd. This movie puts me in the Christmas spirit everytime I see it, even in the summertime. I love the soundtracks. I love this movie better than the first one! It never gets old. If you love Christmas, you'll love this movie, I'm almost thirty and I still love this movie. You have to be a grouch not to like this movie!
B000002GC2|5.0|This is the first album I ever purchased from my man Mr. Quincy Jones on which I own on tape a long time ago had a nice real beat to it. It has \\"Ai No Corrida\\" on which I like, It has \\"The Dude\\" with everybody from James Ingram, to Michael Jackson, Patti, Stevie, doin' much work. Later on after I own it on tape, I orignally bought on CD just in case it sounds better. 'Cause ocassionaly they go too fast when they brought in LPs first, second- 8-tracks and/or 45s, third-the cassettes and fourth-the CDs. And especially I like every song on this album incl. my favorite picks of all-time are: Ai No Corrida, The Dude, Betcha Wouldn't Hurt Me, Velas, Somethin Special, Turn Off The Action, just to name a few.    Anyway long period short, I urge ya'll to co cop this album and highly recommend BODY HEAT and SOUNDS AND STUFF LIKE THAT on which I own which is my favorites and espccially check out Guru's JAZZMATAZZ, VOL. 1, Alicia Keys SONGS IN A MINOR, Barry White's ALL-TIME GREATEST HITS, Miles Davis KIND OF BLUE, THE WIZ soundtrack, Grover Washington, Jr.'s MISTER MAGIC, WINELIGHT, FEELS SO GOOD, INNER CITY BLUES, THE BEST OF GROVER WASHINGTON, JR.: MOTOWN ANTHOLOGY SERIES, PRIME CUTS: THE BEST OF GROVER WASHINGTON, JR.-THE COLUMBIA YEARS 1987-1999, Chuck Mangione's FEELS SO GOOD, The Crusaders' STREET LIFE, Steely Dan's AJA, Boz Scaggs' masterpiece SILK DEGREES, and much, much more.     As to say this, this is one of my favorites I've ever owned. 'cause this used to take me back while I was growing up.
B00008S2VG|1.0|Actually all pop music sucks especially when its female singers. Madonna ain't even an acception whatsover, quite frankly all her music sucks. She's nothin but an MTV/mainstreem sellout along with Hillary Duff, Avril Lavigne, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Michelle Branch, Jo-Jo, Shakira, Nelly Furtado, Janet Jackson, and Mariah Carey who of course all care about one thing: Money. There's better music out there other than this overrated MTV garbage. Arch Enemy - you damn right, Otep - sure, Lacuna Coil - anytime, Madonna - NEVER!!!!!!!!
B000002ADT|5.0|This is one of my favorites out there. This is definitely a must-have for those that really love Miles Davis. I have read the book about it and its saying that all people who love jazz or don't like the sound of jazz must go buy this album 'cause it change jazz history. And it's all saying that a lot of people like artists, musicians, jazz critics alike or whatever got influence on this album. You know Miles Davis had it all since Dave Brubeck put out his classic album TIME OUT (which I made go cop out) the same year Miles Davis put out that album. <br /> <br />I highly recommend ya'll go check out this album and check out others like BITCHES BREW, DOO-BOP, MILESSTONES, MILES AHEAD, SKETCHES OF SPAIN, TUTU, PORGY AND BESS, LIVE AROUND THE WORLD, etc... <br /> <br />
B00005R2M3|5.0|\\"Underneath Your Clothes\\" is one of the most beautiful love songs I've ever heard.  There are no songs on this album which can't stand on their own.  Never mind about any language barriors.  This one is a winner!  Very highly recommended.  If you have a passion for beautiful music with a Latin flair also check out Raul Malo (formerly of the Maverics) \\"Today\\".  It's not his best work but again, there are some love songs on it which just can't be topped.
B00005B36H|1.0|HA!!!!!!!!!  You have got to be kidding me.  I have to admit the very first time i heard these guys i thought they weren't too bad.  The song \\"Sober\\" was a really good song till they overplayed the hell out of it.  God I don't even know where to begin with this band. To me their cds are just one big song, They all sound the same.  Then you have MJK thinking \\"I'm gonna form another band and make it sound the exact same,\\" then we have A Perfect Circle. It's kind of funny cause i had the radio on while I was working out and this song came on.  I stood there and thought \\"oh great another new tool cd,\\" here to find out it was the group Earshot.  Then you have the group Chevelle sounding the same.  Does this crap ever end?  I cannot recommend this band to a single person.  The fact of people calling this \\"Heavy Metal\\" just makes me laugh.  That's a big punch in the face to the Heavy Metal genre.  Heavy Metal greats such as Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, and many others make this garbage sound like Pop Rock.  People can go on ahead and support this band by buying all their music, as for me i'll never spend my money on this so-called heavy metal outfit.
B0000242AD|5.0|This is the version of Speak and Spell to own. It has great bonus tracks ( mostly b-sides of singles taken from the album ) plus the inclusion of Sometimes I Wish I Was Dead ( which Sire/Warner Brothers in the felt the need to delete from the US pressing of this album.) Great synth-pop. Silly lyrics.  Total ear candy.
B00009L1UP|5.0|This is an amazing album by the boys of Queensryche.  I have to say this disc is inferior to Operation:Mindcrime however, but stands on it's own merits.  The great guitar work of Chris Degarmo/Michael Wilton/Eddie Jackson, pounding drums by Scott Rockenfield, and the mesmorizing vocals by the great Geoff Tate draw you in and don't let go.  There is just something about Queensryche that takes me to a different place when I listen to them.  I think everyone who's into rock/metal should have either this cd or the superior Operation:Mindcrime in their collection.  Definately 2 big albums of the late 80s/early 90s.  Buy it and get mesmorized by the amazing music that the Ryche does blasting through the speakers.
B000002KN8|2.0|If you must have Speak and Spell ( which is quite good, despite being very lightweight, fluffy, lyrically empty early-eighties synth-pop ) do yourself a favour and spend the extra money on the import version. The US version pales in comparison to the original Uk version. There is a great song ( Sometimes I Wish I Was Dead, which is not as depressing as its title would suggest ) that was left off the US pressing, and the extra time was taken up by the inclusion of the 12\\" remix of Just Can't Get Enough (which is better in its original 7\\" mix anyway - over six minutes of Just Can't Get Enough is, well, too much of enough ). There are also a few great b-sides that are on the UK version of the cd.
B0000931QA|5.0|All i can say about this masterpiece is out of the hundreds of cds I own, no one will ever top this disc.  I cannot even put into words my feelings about this disc.  EVERY song on this disc is nothing short of amazing. The story this disc contains is very powerful.  This is \\"Thinking Man's Music.\\" Definately not any of that mainstream crap on this disc.  I have never heard anything like it, awes me everytime I pop it in the player.  \\"Operation:Livecrime\\" is an amazing video to watch on my big screen, lights off, surround sound pumping melodies around me, sucking me into the screen.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND both cd and the dvd, I promise you won't be disappointed at all.  Buy this disc as soon as possible and let Queensryche awestruck you too.
B00005JNEI|1.0|WARNING: SPOILER <br /> <br /> <br />Fahrenheit 9/11 is all lies constructed by Michael Moore. It is funny that Moore states that \\"there is no terrorist threat\\" when the title of his \\"documentary\\" makes use of the largest terrorist attack on the US ever. A funny example of his lies: the speech in which President Bush thanks his \\"elite base\\" actually occurred. But Moore failed to show the rest of the speech and state the environment that Bush made it in. The speech was at a dinner sponsored by the Catholic Church and Gore was in attendance as well. Traditionally at this dinner, politicians make speeches that mock themselves. Bush mocked himself and Gore mocked himself also. But does Moore point this out...no. Spend your money on FahrenHYPE 9/11 instead...it debunks all the lies and fabrications that Moore creates. [...]
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Let me say right up front, I love monster movies, and I'm very forgiving of their flaws.  For some reason nothing gets me into a movie like a good werewolf.  If you're like me and you love supernatural critters onscreen, then this is the flick for you. <br /> <br />A sort of industrial remake of \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" \\"Underworld\\" pits warring clans of vampires and werewolves against one another in a dark, stormy, goth-chic world straight out of \\"The Matrix\\" or its far superior predecessor \\"The Crow.\\"  Our Juliet is the vampires' chief assassin, while Romeo is a hapless med student bitten by our heroine's furry foes. <br /> <br />Yes, this is a movie that stresses style and visual spectacle far above plot and substance.  So what?  You came to see a movie about a hot vampiress in leather shooting up a bunch of werewolves, you can't expect Oscar material here.  That said, there are some refreshingly unexpected plot twists, and the line between protagonist and antagonist often becomes blurred -- or flipped completely.  There are no good guys or bad guys here: you can choose whichever beastie you like to root for.  (Personally I'm a werewolf kind of guy.) <br /> <br />Horror fans will also be happy to see a mummy of sorts and another supernatural predator later on which can only be described as incredibly geek-cool.  The leader of the werewolves is a definite scene-stealer, what with his slight frame, arm sword, and ability to simply spit out silver bullets by flexing.  Trust me, he's a fun character. <br /> <br />This is a popcorn flick, people, and a fun one.  From flourescent bullets to black leather SWAT teams, sit back and enjoy the mindless catharsis of a monster-on-monster gang war.
B00000IAU3|5.0|\\"Here With Me\\" is the \\"Roswell\\" theme song and she ended up being the official songbird of the series--even got a mention in one episode.  Majandra Delfino may have sung in front of the camera, but \\"Thank You\\" shows why Dido recorded the theme song.  Roswellians hold her banner aloft.<br /><br />Dido continues to get better and this album holds the seed of a great artist.  She may be no angel, but you couldn't tell that from her voice.
B000092Q4U|4.0|Lamb Of God's ATPB is by far one of the best metal acts I have ever seen.  Their Ozzfest show was abosolutely devastating, just like this album, although they didn't play much of my favorites from their previous albums, they did play my favorite off ATPB. \\"In Defense Of Our Good Name\\" is the best song on the album it has the catchiest guitar riff and nice slow breakdown that leads into the most hardcore bridge that makes me bang my head everytime I hear it.  This album should be a must for any Hardcore/Metal fan. Also Check out God Forbid, Shadows Fall and the latest Black Dahlia Murder, Converge also has a new album.
B00005YW4H|5.0|How do you describe Norah Jones?<br /><br />\\"'Stead of kneeling in the sand<br /><br />Catching teardrops in my hand<br /><br />My heart is drenched in wine<br /><br />You'll be on my mind<br /><br />Forever<br /><br />I would cross the endless sea<br /><br />I would die in ecstasy<br /><br />But I'll be a bag of bones<br /><br />Drivin' down the road alone.\\"<br /><br />Let's see.  Poetic?  The music has the imagery of vivid poetry.<br /><br />Soulful?  How many of us have felt like our hearts are drenched in wine?<br /><br />Sensual?  Besides the voice, the words evoke the senses as well as the emotions.<br /><br />Lip-syncing?  Forget it.  Norah is the real deal.
6305263248|3.0|I was given this film, purely because it's impossible to resell, and the person who gave me it got it on special edition. So this is now taking pride & place in my DVD collection. I've apparently seen this movie before, but didn't review it at the time, but rewatching it, I don't remember a thing about it. I remember the second car chase, where they go through the Paris tunnel, where Diana & Dodi Fayed died, and although this car chase was just as spectacular, the first, more simplistic one was great too. And I don't remember that! But I'll review it now. Just to make sure.<br /><br />The car chases are pure spectacular in this. There's no CGI, unlike Matrix Reloaded, or no major jumps over 50ft gaps, like Speed. Just simple speeding, and crashing into other cars. I'll never understand how car chases like this how managed! Stunt drivers are used, but it must take a hell of a lot of work to get it right. To make it look like Robert De Niro and Natasha McElhone were actually driving during the car chase, right hand drive cars were used, with the passenger side made up to mirror the real controls. The actors then mimicked the stunt drivers movements.<br /><br />My favourite character in this was Natasha McElhone (Deirdre) - try saying that when you've had a few! The last name is a real tongue twister, and it took me most of the duration of the movie to get my tongue around it. She's great looking, and has gorgeous clear skin, and gorgeous hair. I felt there was a real chemistry between her & Robert De Niro's character, even though he's loads older, and lets face it, not exactly Mr Hunk of the century!<br /><br />Robert De Niro I think, looking back on the movie is perfect for this role of Sam he played. He's quiet, resourceful and deliberate, and plays the part perfectly. He's not a typical in-your-face hardman hitman. Him & Jean Reno make a great team together.<br /><br />I found in this movie a lot gets pushed aside to keep the action flowing throughout, and not have any dull moments. I found this particularly with the would-be romance between Sam & Deirdre, that could have been brought forward, just slightly more, instead of one big kiss and that's it. Nothing more.<br /><br />The scenery is fantastic in this movie, based all (or nearly all) in France, around Nice & Paris, but with not many great landmarks, so you can come into the middle of the film, and not where the hell it's based. There's not constant shots of the Eiffel Tower, or other French landmarks.<br /><br />You never find out what's in the case during this, which in some ways, can be bad, and can be good. For instance, you can use your imagination as to what's in the case, and not feel stupid for thinking that it's this, that or the next thing.<br /><br />I loved the fact that Natasha and Jonathan Pryce spoke with Irish accents in this. Previous reviewers have said they found this irritating, and although Jonathan didn't speak that much, they were great voices to listen to. Lovely.<br /><br />I found the finale of the movie to be a major disappointment. The last half hour absolutely dragged, and the finale just didn't work out the way I would have liked. But I'm a romantic at heart, and although I draw the line at Sam & Deirdre running across a meadow with a blue sky, all alone in the world, and into each others arms, I would have liked a happy ending. And then I watched the alternative ending featured on the DVD (no TRAILER?! Sacriledge!), and was even more disappointed. I ended up wishing I'd not bothered watching the alternative ending, cos it was even more disappointing than the original in the movie! I want a happy ending please.<br /><br />This is a good movie if you want a fast action film with lots of twists & turns, and stunning car chase sequences, which will take your breath away. For me, the finale lowered my rating. Boo. But it's very watchable. Get it. Or get the special edition.not have any dull moments.

B0002DB50E|4.0|The answer: because it is absolutely mesmerizing.  Of course, those of you who are familiar with this very unusual tale will recognize that line uttered by the diabolical (SPOILER!) Barry Convex is actually a very well placed pun.<br /><br />I haven't yet seen the Criterion version of this film yet but if it is anything like other Criterion discs that I've seen it will be great.  In any case, the movie, while extreme, is definitely worth seeing if you can take the violence and the lurid atmosphere.  Not recommended for kids though.
B00007BKVC|4.0|This is one of those movies that you can watch with your best girl friend, with the alcohol flowing, or you can have a quiet night in with your best guy, as long as he doesn't go on about the fact Brad Pitt is in this, and yes ladies, he does get his top off. Easy on the eyes, but the accents (or Southern drawls) will get slightly on your nerves!<br /><br />Yet again, I seem to be on a roll, and having a mad time reviewing films that have a common theme in them - there's lots of driving! And I still can't figure out the stunt drivers and all that kinda nonsense! A total of five identical 1966 Thunderbird convertibles were used throughout the shoot: one 'star car', one camera car, one back-up car, and two stunt cars.<br /><br />Susan Sarandon & Geena Davis make a great double act in this movie, with Susan acting more of the mother hen during some scenes, but sometimes it can swap over. And then they have a good girlie time.<br /><br />There's quite a few funny scenes in this movie, and they're laugh a minute. The sequence where Darryl slips and falls over on the builder's supplies as he is leaving for work was unscripted, as Christopher McDonald genuinely lost his footing. Despite this he remained in character (how hard must that have been?! I would have fallen about laughing), yelling at the workmen as he got into the car and drove away. Ridley Scott apparently liked the result, and so it remains in the film. In the scene where the tanker truck is shot and blown up, the reactions of Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis were supposed to be genuine. Rather than filming separate reaction shots, director Ridley Scott rigged the tanker to blow up during the take, in order to get authentic expressions of surprise from the two leads. Despite this, they were so astonished while watching it that they forgot to actually react, so Scott had to film their reactions again.<br /><br />For guys who are likely to start muttering about how Brad Pitt gets his top off in this movie, chill. I must be the only female in the world who doesn't think he's that terrific looking. He's easy on the eye, but not my type I'm afraid ladies. Give me Keanu Reeves over Braddy anyday! The problem with Brad is he looks like he would spend more time in the bathroom than me - except when he had that godawful beard that is! Brad leaves a strong impression as the charismatic blonde thief J.D. It's easy to see why this film made him a star. And what about the rest of the male actors? Harvey Keitel is charming as the sympathetic lawman, Hal, and Michael Madsen's turn as Louise's boyfriend Jimmy is wonderfully nuanced.<br /><br />The rape scene - he doesn't end up raping Thelma, but you know what I mean - is very graphic in some scenes, with close ups of panties and Thelma getting slapped about, it makes me quite teary.<br /><br />I enjoyed seeing the American countryside along the journey. From the dusty roads in the desert, the mountains and open paddocks, to the bars, hotels and roadside stops. It really gives a true feel of what the American rural areas are like. There's one scene filmed at night, where it's just them on an empty road, and it's breathtakingly beautiful. A scene to be seen - if you get my drift.<br /><br />This special edition has loads of cool looking, but dull extras. Your bog standard extras basically. I was really looking forward to the alternative ending with commentary (love these things), but it disappointed me. For anyone with a tiny bit of an imagination could have imagined that they might have survived the fall. I always think that. The rest of the extras include: commentary by Ridley Scott; commentary by Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis and screenwriter Callie Khouri; \\"Thelma & Louise: The Last Journey\\": a 2001 three-part documentary (conception & casting, production & performance, reaction & resonance) featuring new interviews with Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis, Michael Madsen, Brad Pitt, director Ridley Scott, and writer Callie Khouri; featurette; deleted and extended scenes; \\"The Final Chase\\" multi-angle storyboards; and \\"Part of Me, Part of You\\" music video.<br /><br />This film will probably in a few years be considered a classic if it isn't already. A must have for your collections. Just don't decide to go driving after watching. You never know who you might come across, or what you might do...; featurette; deleted and extended scenes; \\"The Final Chase\\" multi-angle storyboards; and \\"Part of Me, Part of You\\" music video. <br /> <br />This film will probably in a few years be considered a classic if it isn't already.

B00000J6AG|5.0|This alum is simply amazing.  Of course it has probably been over-commercialized...but thats because its dam good.  The mixture of dance, rock, soul, r&b, and electronic is just great.  This should be a fixture in anyone's cd collection.  The cd is one of the top 5 in the last 10 years. <br />
B000067G3C|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! Alongside Titanic & Pearl Harbour (see, I have no taste in films, according to some) this is one of my favourite movies. I remember the first time I watched this, it was on TV, and I was still in my early teens. I found the start credits extremely boring, and then Dennis Hopper stabbing the guy in the head (well, I'm guessing that hurt), got me interested. And then Keanu Reeves (Jack Traven) came on screen, and the whole world just stopped. You know what that's like when you see a really cute guy (or girl, whatever your preference)? This film got me obsessed with Keanu, and even though he's done some rather daft movies in his time, this isn't one of them. Although it took me another couple of years to see the whole of it, as I got told to stop watching it due to the swearing. Give me a break, I was only young - my mum seems to think I picked my language from somewhere else, when really, it was from her!<br /><br />I'm notorious for defending Speed, and probably will do until my death. No one can forget it was the same Keanu who was in Bill & Ted, or they'll do silly impressions \\"This bus will exploooooooooodddddddddddeeeeeeeeeee\\". Good grief, if you don't like the film don't watch it. People definitely have something against Keanu being in this movie, but lets face it, he got this role over loads of others: Stephen Baldwin, William Baldwin, Johnny Depp, Bruce Willis, Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks. Would any of them have filled the role the way Keanu did? The answer is no.<br /><br />What amazes me about this movie, is the chemistry between Jack & Annie (Sandra Bullock). They are (now) two of my favourite actors, and it's just the way they look at each other in the movie - makes you go all gooey inside. Awwwww! This was the movie that shot Sandra to stardom, although she's great in a previous movie, Demolition Man.<br /><br />For the third time in a row, I'm reviewing a movie that involves a lot of driving. The stunt drivers, or someone pulling the bus is shown loads in the extras of this - really disappointing when you're a young innocent, who thought that Sandra could really drive like that! Twelve buses were used, including two which exploded; one for the freeway jump; one for high-speed scenes; and one used solely for 'under bus' shots. The bus jump scene was done twice, as the bus landed too smoothly the first time. The bridge was actually there, but erased digitally.<br /><br />Apart from Keanu & Sandra, there are some great actors in this: Glenn Plummer, Jeff Bridges, Joe Morton, Dennis Hopper etc. Glenn Plummer is fantastic, and also appears in the sequel. He also got his licence taken away two days before he was due to start filming!<br /><br />The extras on this DVD are fantastic, and will keep you occupied for a wee while. They include: commentary by Jan DeBont; commentary by writer Graham Yost and producer Mark Gordon; extended scenes (\\"Jack Shoots Payne in the Neck,\\" \\"Payne Lives/Cops' Party,\\" \\"Annie's Job,\\" \\"After Helen's Death,\\" \\"Ray's Crime\\"); easter eggs (DVD Credits, Airline Version of Bus Crash - which are where?!); Inside Speed Featurettes on the location, stunts and visual effects; production design (60 stills); original screenplay (240 stills); action sequence featurettes on the \\"Bus Jump\\" and \\"Metro Rail Crash\\"; multi-angle shots with audio (\\"Bus Jump\\" - 9 angles, \\"Cargo Jet Explosion\\" - 9 angles, \\"Jack vs. Payne\\" - 4 angles, \\"Metro Rail Crash\\" - 9 angles); multi-stream storyboards (\\"Bomb on the Bus,\\" \\"Baker Sequence,\\" \\"Bus Jump,\\" \\"Metro Rail Fight & Crash\\"); interview archive (with Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, Dennis Hopper, Jeff Daniels, and Jan De Bont); HBO Special; Trailer & 11 TV Spots; Billy Idol Music Video; press kit; production notes (40 stills) and image gallery (various stills).<br /><br />This is a great movie, ignore all the so-called critics, who don't like it. I love it. Although Keanu doesn't appear in the sequel, this is one of his roles that far stands out, andbeats the Matrix trilogy hands down.tands out, and beats the Matrix trilogy hands down.
B000268QB2|5.0|Soft rock doesn't get any better than Keane. Their unique sound will hold any lover of good music enthralled. Tom Chaplin's voice is wonderfully evocative, and what's more he sings the beautiful lyrics with true emotion.  Somewhere Only We Know is definitely the best song but every single track has depth and clarity. Don't you love listening to a CD and never having to skip over any songs? I'm in love with Keane and can't wait for more :)
0451197879|4.0|This was one of the best books i've read in over a year.  The british literature stuff was ok but in the book roadwork King had my attention the entire time i was reading.  I like everything in the book itself.  Examples are the way the author descibes feelings  and emotions, you can also picture what is happening as the plot thickens.  This was one of the best books i've read and i look forward to reading more books by Stephen King!
B00005JN7O|5.0|Overall, I'd say this was a great movie because of its definite uniqueness compared to other recurring film ideas. This movie is made to be a sort of futuristic story, yet it appears to take place somewhere around the 1940's; and that was certainly a factor that caught my interest. The movie's plot was outstanding and never contained a breach throughout the entire course of the film; and the forms of gadgetry included especially near the movie's end were very ingenious and clearly took much work to come up with. I would give a full five stars to Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow for the reasons that it was a very adventurous and innovative movie and was relatively exciting also; and would recommend it highly to all moviegoers nationwide.
B00006FDCD|3.0|I have read the novel, and seen the movie.  I was really freaked out when I saw the movie for the first time.  The scene that really freaked me out, was when the picture came to life and Pennywise the Clown was moving forward in the picture, and eventually yelled BOO, and his hand came through the photo. I thought the movie was the best thing since sliced bread, that is until I read the book. <br />As I saw the movie before I read the book, I was a little disappointed in the movie.  It failed to really explain the extent of the \\"7's\\" relationship to one another, and the origin and history of IT in Derry (like how it came to be there?).  I know somethings are changed, and left out when translated to the scene, but in my opinion too much was left to imagination.  I just feel certain things should have been expounded on, instead of a 3 hour movie, maybe a miniseries would have been better.  <br />I would still recommend the film, albeit dated in sfx and look. I loved John Ritter (always loved him, since Three's Company days), and Annette O'Toole (especially now as Superman's mother), Tim Reid, and the rest of the cast. I have added IT to my DVD collection. Not one of the best Stephen King adaptations, but not one of the worst either.
B00005JMXX|5.0|I thought The Day After Tomorrow was a great movie because of the never-ending tense moments it unfolds, the undoubtedly spectacular special effects, and the deliciously clever occurrences the movie shoves in every now in then (such as the Hollywood sign being eaten up by a tornado, as you may have seen happen on the trailer). The plot is actually fairly lame; but the incredible disasters that are portrayed on screen are so insanely awesome that the plot no longer became a problem for my judgment. Scarcely a minute in this film is left without a scene of action or a key event, and many times I found myself on the edge of my seat when viewing this movie for the first time in the theater. Additional positive things concerning this film were that not many movies have been made like this one, and that the deaths of certain characters are well planned so that they affect the viewer strongly. I would declare The Day After Tomorrow a must-see movie for all these reasons and more.
B000059XUO|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite films.  The story is simple, but the presentation, style and raw emotion make it a film that will not be forgotten.  The almost black and white look of the film, contrasted with moments of light shining through is breathtaking.  The story takes place in a dark Detroit/Seattle type of hybrid where it is always night and always raining.  Lots of miniatures are used for long shots and shots of the crows perspective as he flies through the city.  I am a fan of the graphic novel, and this movie captures it perfectly.  For one thing, Brandon Lee's physique is dead on for the character, he truly looks like the Eric Draven in the novel.  I've already mentioned the black and white look of the film.  And the camera shots look like comic book panels.  The 90's grunge soundtrack and more importantly the beautiful musical score goes a long way in giving the film emotion.  The acting is great all around, especially Brandon Lee who would have been a star after this role.  The fact that he died making the film gives it an eerie and melancholy feel.  I just think the look and sound, music, work to create a almost poetic film that is both viceral and absolutely beautiful.  Definitly a film worth repeated viewing, making it a must buy.
B00005JMH2|2.0|I enjoyed the music and the dancing - not enough of it though - it was pretty to look at and enjoyed the premise of the ballroom dancing scene - However,after digesting the crux of the movie it seems really silly - True love for his wife but secret desire to dance? Why hide taking dancing lessons? Gere never came across as really loving anyone but himself - there just was not any chemistry between either women to me. Middle age women loved the end - however, to keep hidden so long from his wife the dance lessons and his new set of friends seems suspect - I have not seen the original film - perhaps the Japanese culture better explains this premise - but not in the United States -  <br />As I originally stated - good movie for the music and dancing - enjoy it for what it is - but something definitely missing in the common sense department.
B000002VMH|4.0|I give the first half of this album * * * * *. The first two songs are the hits \\"Why\\" and \\"Walking On Broken Glass\\". The next several songs are of similar high quality. Then a big plunge as the second waddles in mediocrity and gets  * *. Talent without strong material is like going to the Caribbean in the rain. So overall grade is * * * 1/2
B000089RVR|2.0|As an ardent fan of Dido's debut album, I was very much looking forward to her next studio album.  After such a powerful first, however, I was a bit concerned that she would hit that second-album slump that seems to strike so many musicians.  Sadly, that's what happened with Life for Rent.   <br /> <br />Put plainly, most of the songs on No Angel combined solid (or even interesting) musical textures with lyrics that were variously biting, tender, introspective, and even poetic, sung in Dido's nuanced, but still very accessible voice.   <br /> <br />Life for Rent seems to fail everywhere No Angel succeeded.  The beats, guitars, and synthesized music in Life for Rent have largely been stripped down, but the result is a generic austerity.  If the music had been simplified to further showcase Dido's voice, that would have been fine--if Dido's voice were worth listening to on this album.  Here we come to the most frustrating aspect of these songs: most of the time, it doesn't even seem as though Dido is trying very hard.  An overwhelming sense of fatigue comes through in Dido's vocals for many of these songs.  On the track Who Makes You Feel, which threatens the mediocrity of the album with some potentially funky opening beats, Dido sounds as though she recorded the vocals just after jogging up a few flights of stairs.  Often the breathiness used to such great effect on No Angel descends into atonal laziness in Life for Rent.  In addition, the lyrics seem more cliche this time around.  It's possible there's a lot of Dido in these lyrics, but if so, it doesn't come across well. <br /> <br />Some of the songs, like Sand in My Shoes, manage a catchy hook, but a song should be more than a hook. <br /> <br />The two flagship singles, Life for Rent and White Flag, were unremarkable, I felt (though Life for Rent did have some lyrics that resonated for me personally).  Not execrable, but far from great.   <br /> <br />Definitely deserving of attention are the last two songs on the album, This Land is Mine and See the Sun.  Perhaps these last two songs point the way to a more musically interesting third album.
B0000029AP|4.0|Many consider this to be Aerosmith's best and it is pretty good but I rank \\"Get Your Wings\\" as their best. The best tracks are the big hits \\"Walk This Way\\" and \\"Sweet Emotion\\" which still sound great even after 30 years of radio play but some songs just don't hold up to continuous airplay like \\"Big Ten Inch\\" which I hope never to hear ever again. Other strong cuts are \\"No More No More\\" and the ambitious \\"You See Me Crying\\" with the added touch of a string section with soaring guitars (Perry or Whitford?) which I think worked out surprisingly well for a down & dirty band just two years removed from opening for Sha Na Na. I thought the rest of the album was just your average Aerosmith. This has been digitally remastered with no bonuses.
B000002KB8|5.0|That line, \\"they're not even on mtv\\" sums it all up. Some people are wierd, so they make really retared critisizms to piss people off. One person reviewing a Jimi Hendrix album said to listen to Good Charlotte or Linkin Park for interesting guitar riffs and solos, it's not real. Oh yea, this is a review, this album kicks a$$, Sabbath is the greatest.
B000286S8S|1.0|...because I already own the six albums with David Lee Roth on vocals. I have always been of the opinion that Van Halen threw away their greatness when Dave left/got fired from the band. Although the warning signs were on the wall with 1984, with 5150 and Sammy's induction into the band Van (Hagar) became a hack corporate rock band; no different than say Journey or Foreigner. Although Sammy wasn't totally to blame, it was a path he had taken in his solo career long before that and alot of the Van (Hagar) songs sounded more like Sammy solo releases with a guest appearance from the greatest guitarist alive. It was a pity and I weep for Eddie, Alex and Michael's poor judgement.<br /><br />However, although they had a few good songs left in them, I quit buying the Van (Hagar) albums after OU812. Since those purchases were on cassette I figured I would buy this and put together a decent one disc Sammy compilation. Mission accomplished (although I would have liked Human's Being and Summer Nights to be on there too)<br /><br />As for the 2 disc set itself and it's relative merits or demerits....<br /><br />The fact that they chose to treat Dave the way they did (probably with smiles on their faces and giving each other high fives) is sad, a testament to their lack of character.<br /><br />The fact that they chose to mix up the running order ruining any sense of flow, pitting Sammy against Dave (where Sammy comes up on the short end nearly every time) is a testament to their lack of intelligence.<br /><br />The fact that they chose to add three live versions of Dave songs sung by Sammy that WERE ALREADY PRESENT IN THEIR ORIGINAL VERSIONS is a testament to the contempt that they must surely hold for their audience.<br /><br />The fact that the new songs are kinda suck is a testament to the fact that they too, like Dave, are has beens and should've quit while the last vestiges of their reputations were intact.<br /><br />Lastly, the fact that there are no Van (Cherrone) songs are included is a testament to .... I don't know what?.... how about the fact that it was a period better to be forgotten.<br /><br />In closing I think Messrs. Van Halen, Van Halen, Anthony and Hagar owe us one huge apology. They should pay out of their own pockets to have this album recalled and replaced (in the same excellent packaging) with one that has a chronological running order, the live songs replaced with the Sammy songs I mentioned earlier and the new songs erased from our memory. They also should allow Dave equal space in the liner notes to tell his (admittedly equally pithy) side of the story.<br /><br />Oh by the way, in no instance should Eruption be seperated from You Really Got Me ever again (unless Dave Davies tries to give Eruption a go).<br /><br />Thank You for letting me get this off my chest.n (Cherrone) songs are included is a testament to ....

B0000029AP|5.0|This is a great album. There is not a bad song on this CD, they are all great. With Aerosmiths' two greatest songs ever \\"Sweet Emotion\\" and \\"Walk This Way\\", this CD can't miss. I also recomend Aerosmith's \\"Rocks\\".
B0001UZZWW|3.0|I loved the movie Shrek, and the bonus 3D featurette is nice, but because of the way the disks are packaged, I didn't find out until too late that the feature is NOT in letterboxed format. With a movie as visually interesting as this, it is not worth losing so much movie for an O.K. 3D short. <br /> <br />Buy the widescreen version instead.
B000002I27|4.0|The Doors second album, \\"Strange Days,\\" is an excellent follow-up to their self-titled debut, with several classic Doors tunes on it. Jim Morrison, Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger and John Densmore totally shine on tracks like the spooky title song, the catchy blues-rock of \\"Love Me Two Times\\" and \\"Moonlight Drive,\\" the haunting \\"You're Lost Little Girl,\\" the driving rock of \\"My Eyes Have Seen You,\\" and, of course, the 11-minute rock epic that is \\"When The Music's Over,\\" with Jim and the boys really stretching out on their respective instruments with gusto. Only the poem \\"Horse Latitudes,\\" with Morrison shouting the words over jarring, chaotic noises, is a little hard to take. Thankfully, it's only 1 1/2 minutes long. But other than that, \\"Strange Days\\" is a great, essential album in the Doors' catalog.
B0002S943O|4.0|How many times did people post \\"why isn't this on DVD?!\\" or \\"I can't wait for this to come out on dvd.\\" Now that it is available on dvd, people are complaining about that. What a shock! It just never fails. No wonder musicians and entertainers don't have much to do with the internet.<br /><br />This is a simple to navigate dvd with excellent picture and great sound quality, especially if you have a real home entertainment system with surround features. They even included 99% of the set (I think maybe 1 track was missing, \\"Get Right With Me\\"). As for the two bonus tracks, for continuity it would be ok to have them during the concert film, but is it really so hard to go the extras section and play them? BTW, on the picture quality, have you seen a dvd mastered from vhs? Believe me, if they had done that, then you would really have something to complain about. If you want to complain, you could make the case that the versions of these songs don't hold up to previous concert versions.<br /><br />One thing I will say is that the bonus disc did not add much to the overall package. I mean, who is going to sit and stare at the screen projections for several minutes? The MTV documentary is worth watching but brings back bad memories of a train about to derail.<br /><br />Most basic fans will be pleased with this release. The others will at least have something else to complain about once they buy this. And I thought I was a pessimist.
1401301363|2.0|Let me begin by saying I have loved Nigella Lawson's previous cookbooks, and enjoy her tv show. However, I cannot in good faith say that \\"Feast\\" is a great cookbook just because I like Nigella.<br /><br /> The photographs and layout are the worst offender in this book. Her previous books (with the exception of How to Eat, which was only blue and black) had outstanding layout that was very clean-looking, with enticing photographs. However, the photography in this book is uninspired, badly lit, and most times just gross. Even though I can appreciate the Holiday-themed layout, reading the book (and I have read it twice, cover to cover, before finally returning it) it comes across as disjointed and confusing. Recipes overflow from one page to the next, and are not particularly well organized within the chapters.<br /><br /> This cookbook even more heavily features meat in its entrees than her previous books, so vegetarians will find it essentially useless, as most of the recipes would be hard to adapt.<br /><br /> All in all, a disappointing end product from a great idea and normally engaging author. This book sadly falls flat though, and no amount of love for Nigella can keep me from being honest about that.
B0002SROSQ|2.0|...I'd tried to like Nick Cave a couple of times now. People I trust and love do, and this record came highly recommended. Still, after about two songs I want to jump off a bridge -- just to feel something! Or maybe toss on a Justin Timberlake record just to shock my system back into some state of functionality.     I'm not sure what my problem with Cave is: on paper, the lyrics are killer. The band is UNBELIEVEABLY good. And yet, the sum of the parts is quite a hole, swallowing the listener in undulating waves of bathos. Nick's singing is just so fraught with this sort of smarmy irony, these cheesey bogus affectations meant to harken back to great balladeers but just leave him sounding icy and VERY self-conscious.     You know, Morrissey also does the whole old-school-showbiz-morose thing, but he has such a sense of humor about himself that it redeems anything that can be compartmentalized as camp. Cave takes himself so seriously that I find it impossible to relate to him. I see this one gathering dust as I reach for \\"The Marble Index\\" by Nico...
B00028HBKM|3.0|What is the importance of Christ's final twelve hours on earth?  Sure he suffered, no one could deny that after watching the film, but so have millions of normal people.  In order to make a good movie about Jesus Christ one must explain WHY he suffered and what the overarching effect of his suffering are, not just show his torture.  Gibson fails to do this, focusing only on the pain Christ suffered and not what he did with his life, which is far more important.  In addition, his direction is very poor, utilizing obscene amounts of slow-motion that would have seemed gratuitous in a sports movie, let alone an epic.  Furthermore, the use of Aramaic and Latin has no real point beyond being pretentious, and the inclusion of Satan is unnecceasary and somehwat off-putting.  A decent film, but could have been done better.<br /><br />So far I have only focused on the film itself, as if it was adapted from a gruesome best-seller and not the bible (although one could argue they're one and the same).  As to the claims of antisemitism, I must say that the Jews are presented in a very negative light, going to all measures to exact awful justice on Jesus while Pontius Pilot is presented very sympathetically.  I would like to say a few things about Jesus and the Jews.<br /><br />1- According to Christianity, Jesus came to earth to die for the sins of mankind.  Therefore, blaming the Jews for his death is contradictory.<br /><br />2- If God is all-powerful and all-knowing, then certainly he could have saved Jesus if he wanted to and didn't because Jesus was supposed to die<br /><br />3- Jesus, in the eyes of the Jews, was a heretic, and the Christians have certianly done their fair share of persecuting heretics.<br /><br />Although to be honest not all the Jewish people are portrayed badly, and knowing Mel Gibson and his father (a Holocaust denier), things could have been much worse.  However, while I am not Jewish, I am sick and tired of people villifying them for the death of Christ, and there was no need to make Pontius Pilot so pious and the Jewish leaders so megamanical.  5/10no need to make Pontius Pilot so pious and the Jewish leaders so megamanical.  5/10
B000001ESN|5.0|This is one of Rush's best (if not their best) albums. It's on par with Moving Pictures and Signals. All of the songs are innovative and energetic.  Nothing boring here folks. <br /> <br />This is the album that sealed Rush's hegemony in musical cirles in my mind.  From 2112 to Permanent Waves.  This is the epitome of their work.  Unfortunately, later albums just don't measure up.  How could they with an album as good as this one.
B000002UEB|5.0|Operation: Mindcrime is the album by which Queensryche is known throughout the world; people who know little or nothing about the band have at least heard of them because of this record. It is perhaps the most revolutionary prog metal album because of its compelling storyline and masterfully-crafted musicianship. While Fates Warning already started to pave the way for their followers with Awaken the Guardian in 1986, it was mainly Queensryche that managed to break on a bigger scale reaching the masses. This album set the standards for most of the 90's bands; anyone who listens to Heavy Metal holds it very high respecting every second of it.<br /><br />Where to begin? I know it's daft trying to explain the storyline of a deeply moving concept 16 years after its inception, especially if only few of the question marks have been erased since 1988. Basically, Operation: Mindcrime is an epic tale of revolution and intrigue, psychological manipulation, corruption of politicians, media, drugs, murder and suicide. It envelopes a broad range of subject matters dealing with them from individuals' point of view, but on a larger scope, it also offers sociopolitical commentary on the previously mentioned themes. Geoff Tate came up with this incredibly profound concept when he was living in Montreal after the Rage for Order tour. He mentioned he was flooded with an abundance of lyrical ideas while sitting in the back of a Catholic Church with a choir singing in full voice around flickering candles lightening the gloomy atmosphere of the place. The foundations of the storyline came to him in a flash and he mentioned writing most of the story within a span of twenty minutes. He broadened his scope by coupling the interesting tale with different personalities he'd met on his travels. One of these characters became Doctor X, a man with cold, calculating and vicious personality whose alleged involvement with a terrorist organization was the inspiration for this record.<br /><br />Of course it's not just about the music. When Tate presented his idea of a concept piece to the band, the only member who embraced the offer was his principal writing partner Chris DeGarmo. Had it not been for DeGarmo's bold move and creative input this disc would have never been what it is. Besides Geoff Tate's cerebral lyrical work and amazing vocal delivery, it is Chris DeGarmo's esoteric songwriting what makes O:M a timeless masterpiece. While he isn't credited as a composer in tracks such as \\"Speak\\" and \\"Revolution Calling\\", I would bet my life that those tracks were all given their final touch by DeGarmo and noted producer Nick Collins of Rush fame. The album shines from start to finish peaking particularly with the lyrics of \\"Revolution Calling\\" introducing the storyline and \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\" delivering the message of the entire record successfully. \\"The Mission\\" being one of the many 100% Chris DeGarmo creations sees Geoff Tate performing a rock solid vocal performance backed up by powerful melodies. \\"Spreading the Disease\\" once again displays Geoff Tate's amazing talents as a lyricist while the 10-minute epic \\"Suite Sister Mary\\" sees the entire band performing with incredible chemistry and conviction. Of all songs this one has the most unconventional song structure with Tate's vocal melodies taking you to heights where you might want to freeze forever.<br /><br />\\"Eyes of a Stranger\\" is/was not only the major hit of the record getting good airplay from MTV, but it is also the culmination of the O:M story. While the video displays the many facets of the story, the song lyrically gives a rundown of the concept edging back on the heaviness but never sacrificing the integrity of the album. I stopped being a Queensryche fan after their 1994 release Promised Land as their new musical direction seemed to betray their roots; therefore I can't say I am too excited about the sequel of the Mindcrime story. Honestly it all seems to me as a new way to cash in on the money. What Tate and Wilton forget, however, is you can't create the same magic by just naming your record O:M 2 even if you get the exact same line-up. It's about what DeGarmo really feels and how much he honestly puts in the record and let's face it there no longer is a fire in DeGarmo that would prompt him to write another masterpiece of this calibre. Why don't we just cherish what we have and keep listening to the original Mindcrime record?the money.

B0002OXVDW|3.0|It's high time these films were brought to us in DVD, but the quick-and-dirty (often very dirty) transfers really take the bloom off the rose. The aspect ratio issue was handled well, but that's about the best we can say for these third-rate transfers. <br /> <br />Material like this deserves proper restoration for its DVD release. Instead, we get color shifts, heavy grain, overwhelming amounts of negative dirt, mars, and scratches. We are even treated to scribed cue marks on the transfer print of show #2. To see changeover cues on a 2004 digital transfer represents the height of \\"who cares\\" sloppiness. <br /> <br />Perhaps some day down the road, this material will be given the \\"Criterion treatment\\" that it deserves. Meanwhile, we'll have to enjoy it through all the obvious deficiencies of this carelessly-made edition.
B000002H97|5.0|This is a change for Metallica.  First off, I'm going to say to the kid who wrote the review saying this is metallica's first album is completely wrong.  Kill em All, Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, and ...And Justice For all came before this.  Anyway, this album has so many excellent songs on it.  I can't even tell you my favorites because every song is that good.  They're all masterpieces.  Bob Rock changed Metallica though, as you can tell.  After the Black Album they changed their sound to a more mainstream audience.  But it's still some good stuff.
B0002EXH54|5.0|This is Megadeth's 2nd best album, roughly on par with 'Countdown to Extinction' and a solid cut below 'Rust in Peace' <br /> <br />Note that I rarely give an A+ <br /> <br />'Wake Up Dead' is an awesome opener with a wicked sustained riff in the opening 2 minutes that I can't describe but LOVE A+ <br />'The Conjuring' has weird vocal delivery but a cool midsection A- <br />'Peace Sells' is one of Megadeth's best songs. Classic all the way A+ <br />'Devil's Island' Good chorus makes up for mediocre music B+ <br />'Good Mourning/ Black Friday' is one of my personal anthems. Starts slow, ends thrashy.. the best here A+ <br />'Bad Omen' sounds weak at first but does grow on you, NOT filler B+ <br />'I Ain't Superstitious' IS filler, doesn't fit well but hot horrible B- <br />'My Last Words' is a good way to finish the album, sick. A <br /> <br />There you have it. In my opinion PS..BWB? has 3 A+ songs.  <br />Rust In Peace has 4 (Holy Wars, Hangar 18, Lucritia, Tornado of Souls) <br />Countdown to Extinction has 3, (Symphony of Destruction, CTE, Sweating Bullets)  <br />TWNAH has 2 (Dread and Fugitive Mind, Return to Hangar)  <br /> <br />Youthanasia, Cryptic Writings, Killing is my Business and Risk have none.
B0002SROT0|5.0|I've been waiting for this album to come out.  This is the only album I have pre-ordered and I'm glad I did.  After listening to the whole album 3 times, it has grown on me a lot. I could list this album as one of my top 20 favorite albums of all time(along with the other E.S. Albums).
0671027387|2.0|for this piece by Dan Brown. As other reviewers have noted, it is no AngelsDemons or DaVinci.<br /><br />I bought this at the airport while waiting for my flight.. It was just enough to keep me engaged in some kind of mental activity, but I would say the plot is quite predictable and has nothing of the richness that you can find in the DV and AD. Had I sat down to read it like I did the DaVinci Code I wouldn't have even finished the book.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|If you are one of those Dream Theater analysts I think you will want to spend time listening to this album because it is angry, as in really pissed off.  The music to me is stunning, although I have to say, as much as I love the drummer (another Neil Peart of Rush), actually much better, you start to recognize he has some limitations in how far he can stretch the imagination.  In other words I have heard similar structure from him before.  So much for the little negative the album itself to me was a big surprise.  The first song sounds like Metallica on a good day, I swear it does even though Dream Theater is far more talented than Metallica. I really have to admit that I like this album better than all of them excluding the first, since the first was so compelling.  Metropolis 2 was a bit melodramatic which it was designed to be, but it brought back a better effort by Rush in 2112 Overture.  This album is so stunning though because of the words, the layers of interlocking themes going in different directions and then unification of the themes of each song.  In my opinion there isn't a song here that I consider commercial, and to be released so fast after their last album stunned me, that it was this good.  I think the album is great and thank goodness Dream Theater has not faded like so many bands I've loved in the past.  That has been a long time!
038572179X|5.0|Brilliant psychological novel, in which the interpretive and descriptive elements are carried aloft by a gripping story line the relentlessly carries the reader to the end, punctuated by occasional wry humor, and deepened by the author's profound knowledge of human nature. Very strongly recommended.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I missed this show when it was broadcast on TV, and only bought the DVD set recently because it was recommended by a friend. This is a good sci-fi series, with great characters, interesting storylines, and good dialog. Joss Whedon certainly picked a talented crew - Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk and Jewel Staite are all perfect for their roles. <br /> <br />The stories are an odd mix of sci-fi elements and westerns, set in a world which appropriately mixes high-tech (in the civilized central planets) with more primitive conditions along the frontier planets. Nathan Fillion (Captain of the cargo vessel \\"Serenity\\") and his crew carry out \\"business\\" along the frontier, hauling cargo, scavenging abandoned spaceships, the odd theft or two. Fillion makes a refreshing change from the usual run of self-important captains such as Luc \\"Make It So\\" Picard, or Kirk. There are no worlds in peril here, no important missions to save mankind. Just well-written stories about some interesting people, in interesting situations. <br /> <br />Although the series was cancelled after 12 episodes were aired, it continues to enjoy a strong following among sci-fi fans. Pressure from fans, among other things, convinced Joss Whedon to make a movie based on the series (\\"Serenity\\", release date 2005). <br /> <br />I would definitely recommend this series to anyone who loves sci-fi, or who loves westerns.
B0002XNT0I|5.0|One of the great films of the last quarter century, it is about time that this movie comes to DVD as a special edition.  This is definitely one of Denzel Washington's best performances, but I have to believe that has a lot to do with the fact that the best actor of our time, Tom Hanks, played the starring role.  The interaction between both actors, and the beautiful characters they create, bring more goosebump worthy scenes to the screen than any movie has the right to have.  In what I consider to be Tom Hanks' single greatest scene of his career, I watched a moment that truly made me forget where I was.  Washington plays an ambulance-chaser who takes Hanks' lawsuit over AIDS discrimination, against his better judgement.  The opera scene, where Tom Hanks, walking around his apartment with an IV bag, explains to Washington about the pain and emotional struggle of a fictional character in an opera.  This scene is absolute perfection.  From the camera angles, to the lighting, to the performance by both actors, true emotion pouring through their skin to the very screen itself.  This scene has no peer.  The film is a great creation, from beginning to end, but, it is a must-own for anyone, purely because of this one moment.  Anyone associated with filmmaking, from writers to directors to actors, should order this DVD as soon as possible and study the passion and humanity involved in the making of this film.

B00000DHRX|5.0|I have all of George Michaels' cds since he went solo and there is not one I would so much as even lend to my closest friend.  \\"Best of George Michael\\" is just that, a collection of his most popular hits and his best work to date.  He is one of a very few singer/song-writers that can move you to extremes with his voice and music.  Dance when you really didn't want to, laugh and enjoy the sounds; or listen and feel the meditative moods of the more reflective songs.  Bill of Minn. you sound too homophobic to even to have really listened to this music so any opinion of yours is moot.  Get out of the loo and hear a master at work.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Micheal Moore's \\"documentary\\", if you can call it that, is nothing but his own personal political statements. This film is so one sided towards the war in Iraq I dont know where to begin. When he talks about the war in Iraq he makes ALL American soldiers out to be blood thirsty monsters who just want to kill everything they can see. I myself am preparing to serve a year tour in Iraq with the 42nd Infantry Division in December 04, and I pray that if anything happens to me while i am over seas that my family and friends will not see me in the since tat this film wants you to think of me. I am very patriotic, i believe in the cause and i want to help the people of Iraq govern themselves. This film also makes it look like some people such as the president wanted 9/11 to happen, any American who can say another true American could want this to happen (or apply they would) is a traitor to his country. It is no hidden fact that Micheal Moore doesnt like George W. Bush, and this film exposes how bad Micheal Moore will lie to prove this fact. If you stomach to actually sit through this film that stole 90 minutes of life, them please watch the film FahrenHYPE 9/11, this film goes over interviews with people who were featured in this movie, and how they express thewir true feelings towards this film and how Micheal Moore stole private parts of their lives and quotes for his personal gain ($$$). Its even worse knowing that John Kerry likes this man, if he becomes president with freinds like this, then this country is going to be in a very tough place. So please, if you have any personal caracter and morals, please AVOID this film at all costs, but if you do watch it, please see FahrenHYPE 9/11 also, so you know the truth behind Micheal Moore and his own personal agenda. God Bless America!
B00005OAIE|4.0|Most of this album is good. Then again, there are some tracks that i dont listen to at all. But , \\"neon\\" has to be one of the best songs ever written! As well as \\"no such thing\\", \\"why georgia\\", and \\"my stupid mouth\\". Oh and \\"city love\\". This cd is definetly worth buying but i suggest you buy heavier things instead, that album has alot of great tracks that you can listen to all the way through.
068987474X|4.0|I just read what \\"no nonsense\\" had to say about this book, and i have to say I didn't think it was that horrible. At least it was funny. Anyone who's ever dated has to laugh while reading it. Maybe the book does catagorize men and women a little too much. I know a few women who have been the agressor in the relationship and they are very happily married! However, I also thought there were some good points made. I mean, let's face it, most guys will have sex with women even if they don't want to spend the rest of their lives with them. I don't particularly like that to be true, but I have seen it with my own eyes, over and over again. Understanding this makes some of the generalizations in this book true in dating.<br />I read all of the reviews by \\"no nonsense\\" and they all were pretty negative. If you read this no nonsense, I am curious, are there any books you enjoyed recently?  This book did not make it into my top 10 best read this year. My favorites this year were from Janet Evanovich, Nancy Madore, Jon Stewart (from the Daily Show), and lilian jackson Braun.  What do you think of these authors?
B00004YYDI|5.0|Luc Besson has this ability to create. Create something that can be considered `arty' yet realistically sound. Leon, or The Professional as it was called in America, is easily Besson's best. As good as Nikita was Leon is better, with better actors and most importantly...a better plot.<br /><br />Jean Reno is Leon, a stylish French hitman. Amidst the chaos of New York, Leon finds a source of peace in himself, and no one else. That is until a girl named Mathilda ( Natalie Portman ) walks into his life...or rather stumbles. Mathilda's father is in a degree of drug trouble with the bentest cop you will ever meet, the superb Gary Oldman. Mathilda never really liked her family, except for her four year old brother. Oldman is searching for a stash of drugs which Mathilda's father has hidden, his form of searching is to blow away the whole family, then search. A hands on approach that works. Until Leon gets involved. Mathilda is out getting groceries, when she comes back she has no choice but to go to Leon, who lets her in his flat. Mathilda is taught how to kill by Leon, and plans to kill the bent cops as revenge for her little brother.<br /><br />The relationship between Mathilda and Leon is fascinating. Mathilda claims she has fallen in love with him, despite an age difference of about twenty five years. Leon shrugs it aside. But there are awkward moments where you sense a connection between the two. Something completely unnatural, and would probably be considered child abuse if anything happened. But...it's there...and unavoidable. Don't worry, they never go where your thinking but it's still a very complex idea brought forward by Besson. Is it that unnatural?<br /><br />The film contains some exciting action scenes, and its always a treat seeing how a good hitman works. How he deceives his opponent, out-thinks and out-manoeuvres. Reno is very convincing, with his heavy French accent, and cool shades, its perfection. The cast in general is perfect, Oldman is the obvious star, and I am yet to see him so psychopathic in any other film.<br /><br />I would recommend Leon to absolutely anyone. The plot is simple but intriguing, the relationships bordering the inhumane, the action is fast paced and gets the adrenalin moving, best of all the acting is stellar. It's also a very moving film, and really gets in touch with reality. What more could you want?e obvious star, and I am yet to see him so psychopathic in any other film.  <br /> <br />I would recommend Leon to absolutely anyone.

B00005JNEI|5.0|just been reading some of the reviews on this site, there is a lot of fundamentalist christians upset by this film isn't there! good. one or two of the reviews have called this film propaganda, it's not, it's exposing the truth about the bush administration, and it's part in an agenda to create a new world order, a one world government. I think this film is good, but it doesn't go far enough for me, the government lie to people constantly, using mass mind control (religion, media, patriatism)to stupify the people into thinking murdering 100, 000 iraqi people, in furthering the american empire is a good idea. Being imbuded with patriatism from birth, (mind programming) makes a lot of people easily controlled by the government, all they have to do is say somebody is threatening our country (lie), and immediatley millions of people will think going to war is a good idea. Same with religion, how to get people to think war is a goos idea? say it's gods work, in the name of god. The bible says killing is wrong, yet millions of 'christian' americans supported murdering iraqi's, why? pure mind control. What micheal moore doesn't realise is that when John kerry gets into power, which he will, he's going to use his four years to advance an agenda to crearte a one world government also, democracy is a lie, we live in a one party fascist state unfortunatley, until we decide to do something about it.
B00000JLWW|5.0|This is my favourite work of all, especially since it deals personally with my own life. Titanic was a work a long time coming, and it took at least five years of constant work for the people, amazing people, to work on this incredible picture. <br /> <br />Despite the people who are skeptical, to me, the power of Compassion is demonstrated in this movie beyond any other, In a love story... <br /> <br />And for me, that's the hallmark of the whole film. <br /> <br />The best part of it for me was that nothing of it was left out, creating a monster three hour long movie in a four act play of sorts, and including all the disasters necessary for beauty to shine through, despite whatever cost it took to get it right. The music is more than delivered; it's created within you. It's not just thinking, it's not just conflict, it's not just wanting, it's not just another hokey love story, but true love, and to me, even though we human beings have a natural tendency to deny the obvious, love is real.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|For all you Slipknot fans out there this album may or may not be for you.It definetely is different from their other two albums but that doesn't mean it's not good.In fact when I first listened to it I thought it was amazing.If you think all Corey can do is scream you are wrong.His vocals in this cd are amazing he even sounds different when he screams than in the previous albums.They keep their heaviness but at the same time they don't considering they have acoustic songs on here like Vermillion part 2.If you don't like acoustic songs you can then look forward to songs like The Blister Exists,Three Nil,Pulse of the Maggots,and Before I Forget.When I say they still keep their heaviness I mean music wise.But when I said Corey cleaned up his voice he doesn't sound as heavy as he use to be.Sure he still yells and screams but it has a kinda softness to it either that or he doesn't use all voice on purpose.I could be wrong perhaps it's just that I have gotten so use to screaming and I can't tell the difference.Well anyway I should wrap this up all in all this cd is good because of the rythm and the more frequent melody in the choruses of songs like Opium of the People.Like I said this album isn't for everybody and if you like old school Slipknot then you might not like this.But don't say that Slipknot sold out or say bad things about them period.I think they deserve alot of credit and this cd just shows their maturity as a band.They are just trying different things out.For the true \\"Maggot\\" this album shouldn't leave you hangin.Slipknot rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|The great humanitarian know-it-all Sean Penn got all bent out of shape because of this movie, all the more reason to go see it and watch his fate...<br /><br />The humor is raunchy, politically incorrect and the movie is filled with cussing and crude sexual humor, that said, I really laughed out loud and would recommend this to any that aren't easily offended and are either liberals with a sense of humor or conservatives.<br /><br />Conservatives should get a big kick out of this script, they really ripped a bunch of blow hard stuck up know it all whinny stupid Hollywood liberals and it was funny as hell.<br /><br />If you're not a prude you'll find the puppet sex footage incredibly funny, if you're the type that gets offended by twisted minds then the sex and violence will be over the top (even though it's just puppets) and you should just avoid the movie, you won't get it or won't like it.<br /><br />I enjoy seeing the idiot fringe left being made fun of, so I really had a blast seeing this movie and recommend it to like minded people.
0393035158|3.0|The Harris thesis is that the modern world, with spreading access to WMD, cannot long survive when cultures schooled in ancient eschatologies clash.  So the thing to do is for the world to, in a sense, grow up and discard ancient myths, or risk blowing ourselves up. This, the clear, portion of Harris' book is provocative.  He writes, \\"Religious moderation is the product of secular knowledge and scriptural ignorance--and it has no bona fides in religious terms, to put it on a par with fundamentalism.\\" That's a great one sentence definition, by the way, for why mainline Protestant denominations in the US are dying.  Without saying it, he makes a case that the West is religiously disarmed in its fight against a worldview, Islam, that has terror at its core.  Harris would have us drop the naive, politically-correct thinking that separates Islamic terrorism from Islam.  Therein, I believe, he articules a compelling case that resides in the minds of many non-Muslim Americans.  <br /> <br />Once that argument is made--that Islam really is a biggggg threat to the world, and that we need to all discard our ancient mythologies--he launches into a discussion of a modern approach toward spirituality.  Here he lost me.  Like wading through a pond of peanut butter. Doesn't mean it can't be done.  It's just really hard.  <br />  <br />The \\"clear\\" part of the book was worth the price of admission.  I don't feel like I missed anything by not getting the muddled part.
B00002Z88D|5.0|It seems easy to dismiss this album. A metal band playing with an actual orchestral symphony? Sacre bleu! But surprisingly it actually works. One of the attractions was that it contains 2 new Metallica songs. One is a definite favorite of mine while the other is merely okay but the orchestra adds something to the songs and fleshes them out completely.  <br /> <br />Ecstasy of Gold: from the Good, the Bad and Ugly soundtrack, only symphony and it's quite nice. 9/10 <br />The Call of Ktulu: the most epic instrumental gets an epic arrangement.  <br />Master of Puppets: James lets the crowd sing too much but it's great and harmony solo sounds nice. <br />Of Wolf and Man: orchestra's good and the bridge sounds better here. <br />The Thing That Should Not Be: yes he does forget the second verse but still good. <br />Fuel: I don't mind the Reload version so this is still the same. <br />The Memory Remains: Annoying Marianne taken out, crowd put in. If they wanted to include a Reload song, could've done Unforgiven II. <br />No Leaf Clover: New song and definately the best. A epic powerful quality with the shifted dynamics like Unforgiven(loud verse/quiet chorus, they're usually backwards) <br />Hero of the Day: a great Load song made even better. <br />Devil's Dance: Another Reload song that I like but nothing much else to say. <br />Bleeding Me: It's great but one part I hate: when the electric does the main riff distorted, Jason has crowd going \\"hey hey!\\", ugh, could barely hear that riff. <br /> <br />Disc II <br /> <br />Nothing Else Matters: Michael Kamen did the original arrangement but it was hard to hear so now it's fleshed out, although one odd part: James does the end solo with a distorted tone...on an acoustic? We-ird. <br />Until it Sleeps: I like the Load version and this one's pretty good. <br />For Whom the Bell Tolls: A classic that sounds more energetic with the orchestra. <br />Minus Human: It's...not bad. I like the intro riff but the rest is meh. <br />Wherever I May Roam: Kurt played the intro wrong(said so himself: check the documentary) but it's pretty good. <br />The Outlaw Torn: Very awesome song with the orchestra. <br />Sad But True: Meh, don't like the orchestra with it. Funny part in concert: James before this says \\"that was all warmup stuff: 17 songs in the set!) <br />One: Oh yeah, does this sound awesome but what's the fascination with going \\"hey hey!\\" all the time? <br />Enter Sandman: Eh, overplayed song but not bad <br />Battery: orchestral intro before band comes in and pretty good closer. <br /> <br />Now there's some obvious bad things: omissions. No Fade to Black, Sanitarium, Creeping Death(the die die bridge would've been awesome with orchestra), Unforgiven 1 and 2 or King Nothing? Bah. <br /> <br />The album is a great listen despite putting some of the heavier songs in that don't gel well but it's great and check the DVD too. <br />
0812550706|5.0|My cousin Rina had been forcing me to read this book for nearly a decade, but I never got around to buying it-- I've never really been into science fiction, you see, and there were so many other books that I wanted to read. A few months ago, she finally gave up and bought me a copy herself. And I'm glad she did. Without giving away a single plot point, I would like to categorically say that \\"Ender's Game\\" is one of the most amazing novels I've ever read: touching, funny, sad, insightful, terrifying, and absolutely original. If you have not read this book, I urge you to do so now. Thank you, Rina!

0156027321|4.0|Yann Martel brilliantly illustrates the incredible survival of Pi Patel in the novel Life of Pi. Speaking as the teenaged Pi, he recreates the unfortunate experience of being stuck on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger for 227 days, into a story that has been thought of as a modern classic.  <br />From childhood narratives to his farewell to Richard Parker, Pi's Bengal tiger shipmate, Yann Martel vividly describes the circumstances and emotions that make up Pi's life. He writes stunning imagery that places the reader in the midst of the event so he or she can also feel the intensity of the situation. After the ship sinks and Pi realizes that he is \\"alone and orphaned, in the middle of the Pacific, hanging onto an oar, an adult tiger in front of [him], sharks beneath [him], a storm raging about [him],\\" (133), the reader shares his loneliness and desperation as if he or she was the one hanging onto the oar.   <br />The plot of Life of Pi is so uncommon and improbable that the reader might think that is a fictitious story; however, it is written so captivatingly that any disbelief is suspended until the end. Even if the reader questions the truth of the event he or she feels the adventure of riding a life jacket raft in the middle of a storm or the discovery of finding human teeth in the leaves of a tree on a little island, and is compelled to finish the book. Although Pi survived 227 days at sea, Life of Pi will not remain unread for so long. <br />Along with being filled with detailed descriptions and an interesting plot, Life of Pi also is a guide that allows the reader to explore personal convictions on several themes including innocence and experience, faith and truth, belief in God, and the relationship between men and animals. The reader might not find sophisticated revelations in the novel, but they are from the view of an insightful and profound sixteen-year old boy. It is while Pi tries to discover himself and the world that he makes perceptive observations and conclusions that the reader uses to explore his or her own beliefs. Pi sees fear as \\"life's only true opponent that forces you to make rash decisions and abandon your allies of hope and trust.\\" (204) This exploration is not forced and is not insulting to the reader; it is a polite guide that can give the reader a new perspective or reinforce his or her existing viewpoint. <br />In conclusion, Life of Pi is a fantastic novel full of splendid imagery, intriguing events, and opportunities for personal reflection. <br />

It hurts for me to say this since i was the biggest fan of 50's underground stuff but fifty and ja rule are  alike. Don't support gay unit or 50! GAYY UNITTTTT!!!
B000002J1S|5.0|Saw this show at the Academy of Music in New York in the 70's. Never saw anything to rival it since. In Music there are few classics that trancend time, culture and the generational void, this is one album that will more then satisfy any serious audiophile. <br /> <br />This album held me spellbound since I purchased it when it was first released in \\"74\\" I believe.  It has grown even better with age and remastering. Really a piece of musical art instead of mearly a \\"concept album\\". The caliber of musicianship is far superior to many so called prog bands that were out at the time. <br /> <br />It would have been nice to have Genesis offer a live video or compilation project engraphting the live show / story. Still, the album (CD) stands alone as one of my favorite works of any band of all time. Worth investing in for the serious listener. <br /> <br />Tommy
B0000931QR|5.0|Very fresh and stylish, they get to show you a lighter shade of the depressing Mecano music, while Mecano is the greatest and you should never put them on the same spot with LODVG these new guys are great, good buy in my opinion...
B00005JNJ7|5.0|This is a very funny movie!  Not for the little ones though!
B00005JN4O|5.0|This is truly a great film that has earned the Oscar as the best film of the year as far as I'm concerned. Everything here from the acting to the direction is perfect. I have seen \\"Ray\\" also, but I think Johnny Depp will give Jamie Foxx a run for his money come the next Academy Awards. Depp's new accent (it changes in every film) and acting are perfect as expected. Kate Winslet and her four boys make up the strong supporting cast and Dustin Hoffman steals a couple of scenes with some great lines. This movie may be a little slow for some people, but magic is in this film for those who come with a little patience...oh, and a box of kleenex for the ladies.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I went into this movie with high expectations and was not disappointed. The movie starts with a little background on what had happened and then takes off right where the first one left off. The battle scenes were great and very realistic. The stars did an amazing job and were true to their characters. Although this movie is three hours long, it went by very quickly. And like the first one, this one ends with more story left to be told. Without a doubt this sequel is just as good if not better than the first. Absoulutely beautiful scenery and the introduction of a few new characters makes for interesting twists and turns. I give this movie 5 stars and would without a doubt see it again.
B00026W82U|5.0|As soon as I heard the preview for \\"Misread\\" on Amazon, I knew I had to listen to the rest of the songs on this CD.  It's a great album to relax to or hanging out with chill friends.  The music is very agreeable with its light-hearted acoustic rhythms and mellow vocals by Erlend Oye and Eirik Glambk.  It's simple, yet beautifully crafted.  The music easily blends into a range of moods, varying between melancholy to optimistic.    I enjoy listening to this when I'm reading, sipping wine on the porch, and driving the remote scenic stretches of mountainous Colorado roads.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|Sure, some of these cuts wouldn't pass muster were The Man still living, but it's still a groovy album. Agree with many that better pairings for some of the songs would have improved things (whoever suggested LaBelle for Over the Rainbow, yes, indeedy, would have been muuch better than Mathis.) Could be that Ray Charles had other things in mind when picking these people tho... Who's to know... A great tribute to a legend who leaves us with some fabulous classics as his final curtain call. 'Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?' and 'Heaven Help Us All'... priceless...
B00007G207|5.0|Although I have not seen the directors cut, I have every line of this movie memorized and even after having seen it more than 60 times I still cry. I was born in America but all four of my grandparents were born in Italy and Scotland. All of my living relatives (besides my mother and grandmother) are full blooded Italian, so I could definetely identify with this move. The cinemaphotography is beautiful as well as the story. I bought the dvd when my Papa was bedridden with cancer and I don't know who cried more... It appeals to anyone who left a culture/town/family behind to start a new life. I highly recomend this movie to any one who likes nostalgia or hearing stories of the \\"old country\\"... juliana
B00005ATQD|5.0|It's a shame that Stanley Kubrick's final film would be so vastly misunderstood by the majority of critics and general public.  The fault, or should I say reason, may lie in Kubrick's decision to be faithful to the original source material, \\"Traumnovelle\\", a novel by Viennese pscychiatrist Arthur Schnitzler published at the turn of the twentieth century.  I read this work after my interest was piqued by the film and the conventions in this translation would seem dated by today's standards.  Kubrick had his work cut out for him in trying to relate it to a modern audience.  In a nutshell, the way I view this film is as a cautionary tale about the importance of fidelity.  The story concerns a physician who seems to have it all: a gorgeous wife, cute daughter, a successful practice.  But the couple seem to be at a crossroads in their marriage.  The good doctor is suffering from a case of wanderlust.  Which leads into a series of surrealist escapades that involve provocative sexuality.  What starts out as a dream turns into a nightmare, which ultimately leads him back to the safety of the situation he found so stifling.  A good question to ask is why Kubrick, who hadn't made a film in twelve years prior to this project, was compelled to this material.  Is this his commentary on the state of modern relationships?  The choice of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as the married couple was curious.  What did Kubrick see in their relationship that would inevitably crumble a few short years after this film was released?  The chilliest portion of the film is not the controversial orgy scene but the scene where Kidman dresses Cruise down in the bedroom after smoking some pot.  The precision in which Kidman assaults Cruise's assumptions about their marriage and how dumbfounded Cruise becomes is downright eerie.  Another question that begs to be answered is how much of Kidman's tirade is real and how much of it was within the character she was playing.  I remember when this film was released in 1999 the rumors that circulated around it were about the film's explicit sexuality.  There was a massive letdown because the movie was more of a portrait of a marriage at a certain turning point.  This is consistent with Kubrick's work that he delivered the unexpected.  Hopefully there will be a kinder re-evaluation in the future of this master's final work.
B00005JNEI|1.0|The manipulation someone as retarded as Michael Moore tries to pull with this movie borders in absolute comedy, it's really sad that someone who's got the back-up to make his own movies can pull something like this off. <br /> <br />But let's try to keep an objective mind : The movie can be fun to watch if you realize it's made by such a biased retard, and watch it as a simple comedy, it will make you get a harder stomach for real films.  <br /> <br />One of the top parts of the movie is watching Michael Moore's grandma playing an Iraq really comical, almost hysterical woman asking \\"God\\" to kill America, to take revenge, I was cracking myself up by watching such a lousy performance trying to show Moore's real view on America. I can't wait to see a DVD with Moore's \\"Late\\" biography since that day, world will be better off.  <br /> <br />By the way, I'm Mexican, and I have to acknowledge that I believe thanks to Bush, even though it's really hard right now, the world's becoming a better place, even if it takes another 100 years.
B000002A46|5.0|I sure do love christmas music... i dust my cd's off in october to start spinning them early.   <br />I have never heard (or think i ever will hear) a christmas cd more perfect than this.   <br />Most christmas cd's (ie: destinys child, christina aguilera, and more young artists) don't have a christmas feel to them.  it just seems like christmas lyrics with r&b music.  <br />This album, however, fuses the worlds perfectly.   <br />Stand-out tracks:  O Holy Night - i thought celine dion and charlotte church sang the best versions... i thought wrong. <br />   All I Want For Christmas Is You - mariah one-upped all of her rivals by writing 3 songs (including this one) for the album <br />   Hark! The Herald Angels Sing - backed by a gospel choir, mariah seems to let them take center stage in this chilling rendition.
B00004ZD69|1.0|Remember the story of \\"The Emperor's New Clothes?\\"  In it, a pair of con-men convince the Emperor that they will make him new clothes out of the finest, most magnificent fabric, which can be seen only by the most intelligent and discerning people.  When the Emperor parades his new outfit through the town, everybody, not wanting to be thought stupid or coarse, pretends they can see it - until a child, unself-conscious and incapable of guile, says simply, \\"but he's naked!\\"    Reviews of this album are much the same, saying how wonderful this music is, how its subtle brilliance can be appreciated only by the truly discerning, and that those who don't like it are coarse, unrefined, stupid.    I'm here to speak with the honest voice of the child: \\"but there's nothing there!\\"  The \\"music\\" is nothing more than dense layers of about 1.5 chords with no melody, no harmony, no rhythm, no motion, not much of ANYTHING - stretching over two CDs.  It reminds me of the recordings I used to make when I got my first guitar (I'm not a guitarist) and multitrack recorder - experiments that helped me learn and grow as a musician, but not interesting to anybody else, and certainly not art.    It's true that popular music sucks right now, strangled by the greedy grip of the Music Industry, but this isn't the answer.  I highly recommend you spend your money on REAL music, and give these poseurs a wide berth.
B00003CXCT|5.0|The original Star Wars trilogy is a classic.  I won't rehash how the films have changed the film industry, films in general (push for blockbusters), merchandising, etc.  I'm writing to mention the documentary included with the bonus materials.  It is very good, especially in light to Lucasfilms' prior \\"extra bonus materials\\" stuff.  I had the Star Wars Trilogy Definitive Collection laser disc set (of which I paid $250), and the extra materials were a joke.  This documentary shows footage from Lucas' original THX-1138 (his STUDENT film), interviews with a wide assortment of people involved, and other notables.  For example, David Prowse (Darth Vader) talks about his \\"casting session.\\"  Warwick Davis & Kenny Baker discuss how Warwick got the Ewok lead the day of shooting when Kenny came down w/food poisoning.  Alan Ladd, the exec at Fox who supported Lucas, discussed the political battles at Fox when nothing was going right during the shooting of Star Wars.  Walter Cronkite & Bill Moyers talk about the impact that the trilogy had on popular culture, Lucas' interest in Joseph Campbell, etc. The list goes on and on.  It promotes Lucas heavily, but the scope is wide, it shows a lot of previously unreleased material, and it is a wonderful complement of the films.  The series stands for itself.  The extra materials really are a bonus.
B00005JKHP|4.0|I just watched this movie again, and actually enjoyed it. For 1979 it was something different then the shoot 'em up Star Wars movies. Unlike those, TMP had something of a philosophical undertone.  <br />The movie has been called slow moving and boring, but I think it suceeds where other Star Trek movies fail: it portrays the realism of space very well. Everything moves along slowly, there is very little \\"noise\\" of the ships racing around, as there wouldnt becuase there is no noise in space. This is the first connection to that other great science fiction classic: 2001 a Space Odyessey. The other connection is the special effects, especially when the Enterprise is moving through V'ger.  <br />I dock the movie a star for two things: 1 the uniforms and 2 the acting. the former are among the worst ever in Star Trek and were wisely replaced by the classier looking uniforms in Star Trek 2-6. And the acting, WOW, it is way below what the actors, even Shatner, would develop in later movies. Shatner in particular is the negative for the acting criteria. His moves are to jerking and his speech has to many pauses.  <br />These two things aside, TMP is great. We have the best looking Enterprise ever, until the Enterprise E in First Contact. We have the same interplay between the actors as we had in the Original Series. And as stated above, the philosophical element is good and this is what has allowed Star Trek to succeed above Star Wars. The idea that this massive complex machine like \\"V'ger\\" is compared to a child is interesting. So in conclusion, dont overlook this movie, its not as bad as you may have been led to believe.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Mulholland Drive is without a doubt one of the greatest movie experiences I've ever had.  I like the point a reviewer below me made about Lynch making great \\"experiences\\" in movies, because that's really the best way to explain this film.  Don't go in expecting a typical, coherent plotline; in fact, you might not want to expect to understand it at all the first time through (I know I didn't).  The key here is to be able to enjoy something that you can't understand or put into words.   <br /> <br />When explaining this movie to others, I often compare it to music, since it's so hard to explain what a piece of music means, or why it is that you really like it.  This movie is like that.  The imagery, the overall feel, the acting, and many single scenes are so intriguing that they don't need to mean anything, or at least not anything specific -- they just work in themselves. <br /> <br />This is not to say that the movie is impenetrable, however.  There are some meanings to be found here, some symbolism, connections between seemingly disparate plotlines, etc.  To a large extent, you can \\"figure it out.\\"  But I've found that, for me at least, that's not really the point.  After finishing it the first time, and being thoroughly dazzled and confused, I read some reviews and analyses, in order to understand it all.  And now I can say that, for the most part, I know what's going on in the movie, but what I can't say is that I enjoy it more because of that knowledge.  The movie's charm to me still remains something unexplainable.  {SPOILER} I can't tell you why the scene in Club Silencio is probably my favorite scene in the history of cinema; yes, the \\"there is no band\\" bit can be used to explain some of the rest of the film, but that's not why I love it.  There's just such an ominous feel, such a mystery, that is, from my experience (which I admit is rather limited) completely unparalleled.{/SPOILER} <br /> <br />And that is the charm that is, in my opinion, unique to this movie.  There are other movies that have twisted plotlines that take a while to figure out, but I've yet to see another movie that reacted so immediately on the senses that I fell in love with it without knowing why.  See this movie.  NOW.   <br /> <br />*Unfortunately, as another reviewer mentioned, this DVD is about as bad as it gets.  The \\"extras\\" are for all intents and purposes nonexistent, and the lack of chapter selection can get really annoying, especially given MD's rather scattered plot.  But, as far as I know, this is your only option.  The movie is worth it by itself, anyway.
B00006LSCX|5.0|I own this special edition of Fever and I'll tell you that it is so much better than the regular version. The bonus CD is super-duper amazing! includes Can't get blue monday out of my head, which is the song that Kylie performs on her Fever2002 DVD, which is also excellent.<br /><br />The remixes included in the bonus CD are so cool, they're very long, but they're great, it's like another song, not a remix; they're really cool and the CD comes into a box, and under the box, that you see in the description, there is the real CD box and you have the picture of the regular version. If you haven't bought it, buy it now!, and if you have the regular version...buy it too!
6305949980|5.0|First of all, this is an awesome movie, a lot of people are skeptical at first but if you watch it I promise you'll love it. <br /> <br />Mostly though- I'd like to say something: a lot of reviewers have been criticizing teenagers for buying merchandise without even watching the movie, just trying to be \\"cool.\\" <br /> <br />At first, I thought it was a stupid trend too.  Of course, I'd never seen the movie.  But all my friends kept pushing me to see it, and finally I rented it. <br /> <br />Wow. By far the best Disney movie of all time, best stop-motion...  Maybe the best movie I've ever seen.  The songs are constantly (including this very second) stuck in my head, and the storyline was great too.  This is defenitely not your average, cheesy \\"saving Christmas\\" movie. <br /> <br />So yeah, now I wear N.B.C. merchandise, but that's because I love the movie, not the products or the trend.  It's true that Hot Topic does have an annoying habit of introducing stupid trends to wannabe- Goths and punks, but most people who wear NBC actually have seen and love the movie.  So please consider that before you criticize us.
B00005JN4O|5.0|Out of all the movies that I've seen this year, (which has been many), I thought this movie,\\"Finding Neverland\\", was the best. It is about how the writer of Peter Pan came up with his ideas. I don't want to give away the movie but here is a brief overview: The movie starts out with one of James M. Barrie's unsuccessful plays, but soon moves on to James meeting four young children and their mother in a park. The children are fatherless. Though he is already married, James becomes attached to the familly and spends most of his time playing with the kids. The games that he plays with the children soon inspire his greatest work, \\"Peter Pan\\". This is a pretty short description of the movie and doesn't explain much at all but to any one who reads this, I encourage you to see this movie, which to me, again, is the best of the year.
B00000I3JO|5.0|Fifteen years out, it is the rare piece of popular music that stands the test of time. I've got thousands of CDs in my collection. For me, Hats is indeed one of those very few recordings, if only for the tone of this terrific album.<br /><br />Tracks like The Downtown Lights, Over the Hillside, and Headlights on the Parade bring out a mellow, urbane, highly emotive sensibility: refined electronica set to sparse, sad, probing beats. Think of a soundtrack for walking along damp and foggy city streets on a late Sunday evening.  This record says \\"Glasgow\\", even for someone who has never visited.<br /><br />Can't precisely put my finger on it, but Paul Buchanan's voice cuts through everything. Sad but fulfilling, mellow yet uplifting.<br /><br />For this listener, Hats is an absolute classic that still very much stands out in my collection.  Many years from now, I can't help thinking that some smart music historian will closely listen to this one.
B00029NMRC|3.0|The first movie was diverting fun, with some surprises - and this sequel follows up with less of the same. <br /> <br />In the last movie, Nick \\"Oz\\" Oseransky (Perry) was a dentist and often reluctant conspirator of on-the-run hitman Jimmy \\"Tulip\\" Tudeski (Willis), as the contract killer lies low in Canada.  At the end of the last movie, Oz married with Jimmy's ex-wife Cynthia (Henstrige) while Jimmy ran off with Jill (Peet), Oz's assistant who turned out to be a contract killer hired by Oz's wife to kill him.  It was diverting fun, which looked more like it was more fun to make than it was to watch. <br /> <br />In \\"Ten Yards\\", Oz and Jimmy remain married but not quite happily.  Oz is a wealthy dentist in Brentwood, CA, but his home less a castle than an embattled fortress oozing with high-tech security devices and dripping with assault weapons.  Jimmy has gone the other direction - setting himself up in a Mexican hacienda, becoming an obsessive domestic god while leaving Jill to do the whacking.  Needless to say it's an arrangement that doesn't make their wives any happier, especially Jill who, skills aside, only accidentally kills her victims. <br /> <br />Complicating things for everybody is Lazlo Gogolak - the father of Yanni Gogolak from the last movie (both being east-European gangsters played by Kevin Pollak) - who is determined to kill everybody from the last movie. <br /> <br />The humor is scattershot.  It's clear that the guys who made this flick are as mystified to the sucess of the last movie as we are, and they've just thrown the leads together hopinng to repeat its sucess, and ramped things up a notch just to remind us that this is a sequel.  Willis seems more hair-triggered  <br />psychotic than the last time (and we must wonder twice as often whether Willis will kill Oz) while Oz seems even twice as clutzy as before.  Henstridge gets kidnapped early, so her scenes are fewer.  Pollack is actually more funny here than in \\"nine yards\\" but the script surrounds him with one-note morons that the movie has no interest in developing.  There are scenes that are supposed to be either funny or scary, and it seems that the writers were as mystified as the rest of us, hoping that Perry's adorable dopiness and Willis's homididal charm would acrry the way. How much you enjoy this flick will depend on how much you enjoyed the last movie.
0780018664|5.0|\\"Just you wait a little while,<br /><br />The nasty man in black will come,<br /><br />With his little chopper,<br /><br />He will chop you up!\\"<br /><br />It is interesting to see that the original iconic image for Fritz Lang's \\"M\\" was the letter written on the palm of a hand, which is what you see on the cover of the VHS edition.  Today the most famous short is what appears on the cover of the Criterion DVD edition, with Hanz Beckert (Peter Lorre) seeing his reflecting and finding the \\"M\\" imprinted on the back of his coat.  Certainly the latter image is the most memorable, but the former really does represent the film better.  Until the final scenes of the film at his \\"trial\\" where he gives his memorable speech, Beckert (Franz Becker in some translations) is more shadow than substance.  What stands out is the idea that the criminal underground would band together in an all-out effort to apprehend the child murderer, and would succeed where the legal authorities would not.  Even in Nazi Germany on the eve of the Hoolcaust, murdering children is beyond the pale for criminals.<br /><br />The opening scene of the film is the best part from a cinematic standpoint, as a increasingly worried Madame Beckmann (Ellen Widmann), waits for her daughter Elsie (Inge Landgut) to come home from school.  In the montage we see Elsie walking along the street bouncing a ball and then tossing it up against a light post.  The camera pans up to the bulletin asking, \\"Who is the murderer?\\" and then a shadow falls over it.  Whatever doubts we have are gone, for we know that poor little Elsie is doomed.  The strange little man in the black suit admires the ball and buys the little girl a balloon while her mother becomes more anxious at home.  Finally there are the shots an empty place setting at a table, of a ball rolling along the ground, and a balloon caught in electric wires before flying away.<br /><br />With the public's angry reaction to the death of yet another young girl, the police increase their efforts, raiding a bar to see what they can find.  While the police are trying to figure out what to do next so are the leaders of the underworld.  The break comes when the blind man who sells the balloons recognizes the tune the killer whistled the day he bought a balloon for Elsie.  Beckert has the habit of whistling \\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\" from Edvard Grieg's \\"Peter Gynt\\" suite (the whistling was dubbed by Lang himself).  Beckert is followed as he stalks his next victim and the tell-tale \\"M\\" is placed upon the back of his coat.  Trapped in an office building, Beckert is captured by the criminals and then placed on trial for his crimes.<br /><br />Tried before a court of underworld criminals, a terrified and bug-eyed Beckert tries to proclaim his innocence at first, but then suddenly confesses in an emotional outburst, screaming, \\"I can't help myself!\\"  In time Lorre's performances would be reduced to caricature, easily imitated by even the most inept of impressionists, but here it is raw and powerful.  When he is confronted with the photographs of the young girls that he has killed, he flinches as if receive physical blows, which only serves to underscore the psychological nature of this classic film.  Up until this point the film has been more about technique and it is not until the child murderer is finally in their hands that the criminals try to come to terms with what sort of monster they have captured.<br /><br />Ultimately I think that in \\"M\\" the efforts of the criminals are best compared not with those of the police, but with the mob mentality that attacks one suspect on the street.  Such a scene presages Lang's first American film, \\"Fury,\\" but it also recalls the scene in Shakespeare's \\"Julius Caesar\\" where the mob inflamed by Antony's funeral oration kills the poet Cinna for having the same name as one of the conspirators (and his bad verses).  Given what was happening in Germany in 1931, it is interesting to note that the violence of the streets, represented by Hitler's Brown Shirts, is personified not by the authorities but by the average men in the street.  I do not want to read too much into what Lang is trying to say about the Nazis in this film, but those who want to make a case for that perspective will find plenty to work with in \\"M.\\"<br /><br />What we now have available is a fully restored version of this classic 1931 film, courtesy of the Munich Film Archive, which features a restored soundtrack, including Lang's originally intended long periods of silence (remember, this is Lang's first sound picture), and the frame size restored to its proper ratio.  What this means is that if you have not seen \\"M\\" in a long while the time has come for you to see it again.  \\"M\\" still succeeds today, even in black & white with subtitles, because Lang invokes both horror and pity for the murderer and his victims, and creates a compelling \\"modern\\" city in which these characters live.  Besides Lang and Lorre, the third person who deserves lots of credit is cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner, who also did F.W.

B0001L3MI0|5.0|Independence Day is a really good movie. It is about aliens who come to earth and try to take it over. The aliens werent scary at all. They looked like big wierd octopus things that walk. I hate fantasy movies but this one was reall good. Watch it.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|the arrangement of the music on this cd is so creative and fiona is such a talented poet. this has been my \\"cd of the moment\\" for about a year- i listen to it all of the time. a must have for sure.
B00009V7RF|1.0|Black Eyed Peas, ever since their first album I was extremely wary of them. Then \\"Elephunk\\" came out and dominated the radio. So I thought this couldn't be any worse than Outkast (and as for that group's fascination with itself, a whole diatribe could be written), since they both abuse the same formula. Yeah, it isn't worse than Outkast. It's so abysmal it surpasses whatever negativity Outkast can possibly score. <br />Fans and ex-fans give the \\"they were underground once but now they sold out\\" justification for this kind of crap. Well, The Roots were underground once and were mediocre, and when they \\"sold out\\", they were just as mediocre. Unlike, for example, MCs with actual skills like Jay-Z or B.I.G. and groups like Gangstarr  and De La Soul, who have kept evolving consistently and properly after being given a lot of attention, BEP, from \\"Bridging the Gap\\" to \\"Elephunk\\" hasn't evolved, it just reused the same banal formula to sell. That's not once-underground, that's never-underground, and fans, please. Without their candy-ass production and pretty much quasi-rapping, they're three funky-looking men and one woman who doesn't fit into the equation. I could name drop all day long groups and MCs who are better than this wack crew, but I suppose this review will have to do. <br />If you want to continue buying into this total bull, please do so. You only magnify the gap between the struggling underground and the hedonistic rich. While you're at it, go buy the whole lot of hip-crap the record industry threw on the wall and hope it stuck. I'm sick of indie kids and rock fans citing crews like this and saying they hate hip-hop because of them. No sh*t, I would too.

B0000VD04M|5.0|\\"Ed Wood\\" is a classic about a man with a vision. He has vision but no talent. Originally set to be released late last year, there was a delay due to one of the featurettes (later removed). Like Burton, I grew up watching many of Wood's \\"epics\\" that substituted desire and passion for talent and money. Wood's story is an example of the little filmmaker who could regardless of the obstacles.  How else explain \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" or \\"Glen or Glenda?\\" What's great about \\"Ed Wood\\" is you can actually see how everyone bought into his nutty movie ideas. Wood made Super 8 or Digital movies with no budget before anyone else. In that sense, he was ahead of his time.<br /><br />\\"Ed Wood\\" chronicles Wood's difficulty in getting his low-budget visions on film such as \\"Bride of the Monster\\" and \\"Plan 9\\" featuring the marvelous actor Bela Lugosi who had fallen on hard times due to his addiction to morphine and an indifferent Hollywood community that didn't care about the talented actor who helped create the horror genre in the 30's with \\"Dracula\\". It's as much about the friendship and bond between these two men as it is the challenges Wood faced. It's touching, funny, tragic and dramatic all the best elements for an entertaining and memorable movie.<br /><br />The undercurrent of comedy that infuses this film also has a touch of tragedy as well. When Wood realizes that he needs a monster Octopus for his no budget \\"Bride of the Monster\\" for down on his luck actor Bela Lugosi to tangle with at the conclusion does he rent it or borrow it? No, he steals it because he doesn't have the money to borrow it from the studio. So, in one of the funniest scenes cut from the movie, part of Wood's cast climbs over the studio fence in the middle of the night. When \\"actor\\" and former wrestler Tor Johnson can't climb the gate (he's just too darn big), he actually breaks the chain and they rush in to take what they need in a scene that could have come out of a classic Marx Brothers comedy.<br /><br />The entire cast gives a great performance particularly Academy Award Winner Martin Landau as Lugosi.Landau got his start with Hitchcock's \\"North by Northwest\\" and went on to work with other giants of cinema of cinema including George Stevens. Later, he went on to fame on \\"Mission: Impossible\\" and \\"Space: 1999\\". Landau, no stranger to being down on his luck after disappearing into low budget films in the late 70's and 80's, found much in common with Lugosi. A great American actor who finally was recognized for his talent again with roles in \\"Tucker\\", \\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\\",\\"The Majestic\\", \\"The X-Files: Fight The Future\\" and others. A brilliant performance that pays tribute to Lugosi and adds humanity to the film, Landau was rightly recognized for with the Oscar and, in a sense, Lugosi was honored as well.<br /><br />This special edition comes with a number of great featurettes including one that discusses that elusive and popular instrument for science fiction and horror films the teremin. There's also a discussion from make up ace Rick Baker about his make up design for Landau to transform into Lugosi and how he literally did the film as a labor of love. The behind-the-scenes footage hosted by Johnny Depp is, at times, hilarious particularly the footage with Depp in drag. \\"Pie Plates Over Hollywood\\" provides both a nice perspective on Wood, his passion for films and Burton's desire to make the film. There's also trailers, a music video and a marvelous commentary track by Burton, Landau, writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski as well as other crew members. The deleted scenes are also pretty darn good and it's clear most were only cut for pacing.<br /><br />Picture quality is stellar with a sharp and handsome anamorphic transfer in glorious black and white (in tribute to Wood and the era). The only thing missing is the featurette that Tim Burton demanded be removed about the history of cross-dressing. Evidently he felt it wasn't appropriate and pokeda bit too much fun at Wood (at least that's what I've heard). Was it essential to the set? No but it would have been nice and I don't think anyone would have been offended by the featurette. Regardless, I'm glad this marvelous movie is finally available on DVD.te and poked a bit too much fun at Wood (at least that's what I've heard). Was it essential to the set? No but it would have been nice and I don't think anyone would have been offended by the featurette. Regardless, I'm glad this marvelous movie is finally available on DVD.
B0000669JL|5.0|bob marley was a wonderful musician and anyone who disagrees does not have good taste in music. his music speaks to everyone and his messages of peace are inspiring. this cd is great, definitely one of my favorites.
B00005QXXO|5.0|I wouldn't really consider myself a casual fan, but I do prefer \\"The Bends\\" and \\"OK Computer\\" to the newer stuff. Having said that, this CD is great.   <br /> <br />If you like \\"Kid A\\" obviously you will like this, (even though if you are reading this, lets be honest, you probably own both) but if you are like me and didn't take to \\"Kid A\\" right away, this is still a great album.   <br /> <br />The recordings are really good and the \\"True Love Waits\\" track is a lot higher quality than the bootleg one you downloaded-and it's easily worth the price of the CD to finally have this elusive song.   <br /> <br />The \\"Kid A\\" material is great and showcases what makes Radiohead such a great act.  The energy in the performance gives the songs a different, more welcoming feel and you even hear guitars occasionally <br /> <br />Extremely highly recommended; every song is excellent.
B00006AUIG|5.0|I am glad to see this movie gaining in popularity since the release of Anderson's new movie \\"The Machinist.\\"  I haven't been this spooked by a movie since the babysitter let me watch The Exorcist when I was 8 yrs old.  Unlike the scary but implausible villians of typical horror movies, the villian in Session 9 is alive and living in Massachussetts.  Jason, Michael, the Blair Witch, the Devil himself - they would all run screaming from the dark corridors and beautiful, sickening abandoned rooms that are the real monsters in this movie.   I was mesmorized by the visuals, and the plot is perfectly simple: not until the last line of dialog is uttered does the real horror set in.  Be prepared to stay up for awhile afterwards.
B000001FS3|5.0|Where do I begin? This is U2 AT THEIR PEAK. This may be one of the best albums EVER, along with The Beatles' Revolver. The Joshua Tree just blows my mind and takes me into another world as Bono sings at his greatest of darkness and cruelty of this world. The theme of this album is mourning for friends who have passed away, and being isolated in a dark state of mind with no release, apparently. It seems that every U2 album has a theme, like War, Boy, and Achtung, Baby. Anyway, the best two on this album are I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For and With or Without You. They are both, as with the rest of the album, lyrically ASTOUNDING. This is an example of U2, rock and music at its best in DECADES. A must have for anybody who's anybody and whoever has good taste in music. I can't say in words what a brilliant, mindblowing, beautiful masterpiece this is. ***** <br /> <br />PS. Did I mention this album is great?
B00024I2Z4|5.0|<br />Mulan is beautiful in story, art and style. It departs from the normal Disney style giving an Asian feel. The writers do an excellent job sticking to the story and the characters. The \\"sidekick\\" characters add to the story instead of distract which is a problem for a few of the recent animated films.  <br /> <br />What sets this story apart for me is that Mulan is selfless in the story and the themes of family, respect, tradition, and sacrafice take center stage. If you look at other heroes from not just animation but live action too, the main character's motivations are generaly selfish. Mulan puts her life on the line for her father and her country, not for love, or to be human, or rich or so many other selfish reasons we see so often. The morals and principles of this story are very clear and very powerful.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed every aspect of this film from start to finish and like many of the recent animated features in the past two decades this film is definately not just for children.  <br /> <br />Mulan will probably be the last great tradional cel animated feature from Disney for a long time. I know a lot of people enjoyed Tarzan and Lilo and Stitch, but Mulan is a notch above those titles. Unfortunately the traditional cel format has given way to the popular 3d animation features. It is two bad, because I really enjoy both formats. I'm sure it will make a comeback in a decade or two after the 3d genre runs its course, but until then we have the luxery of great titles like Mulan on DVD to enjoy.  <br />
B00005QK39|3.0|I first saw Marillion live at the Theakston Festival at Nostel Priory in Yorkshire during the summer of 1982. They were just breaking on the UK scene and had not yet issued Script. They were supporting Jethro Tull amongst others. When they came on stage they moved the audience with swirling keyboards and Fish's biting and observed lyrics. Marillion are for me what Genesis should have been if Peter Gabriel had stayed with them. Dated now but if you still like Selling England and The Lamb Lies Down then you should like this CD. For me their best work is the later album, Misplaced Childhood, but Script is still fine work.
B000002H2H|5.0|\\"Ride The Lightning\\" is one of those albums that redifined the heavy metal genre by giving it a square kick in the butt. You have to remember WHEN this album came out: 1984. \\"True\\" heavy metal at the time meant bands like PRIEST, MAIDEN, SAXON, DIO and so forth. METALLICA was strictly \\"underground\\" business (much like today's extreme black metal and death metal bands) in that, only a handful of dedicated fans actually went out and bough this when it came out. The buzz on the band was so strong that ELEKTRA ended up signing the band. By mid 80's standards, this was an overtly aggressive, merciless album. METALLICA was one of the few bands that, at the time mada MOTORHEAD sound \\"tame\\"!!! And if you hear the songs, most of them hold up really well, since the thrash metal style perfectioned here hasn't really changed that much. The opening number, \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" is the true definition of \\"Thrash Metal\\" as we know it. Its merciless, nonstop drum beat, relentless guitar riffing and over the top vocal delivery set the standard by which all subsequent extreme metal bands would follow. The title track is a fine example of progressive metal and the album's closer, \\"The Call Of Ktulu\\" demonstrates the bands neo-classical leanings. You might think or say of METALLICA whatever you want now a days, but THIS album belongs in a time capsule for future generations to listen and learn from. Yes, it is THAT good and you too should own this brilliant metal masterpiece!
0316168815|5.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" is an astonishing novel that tells of the horrifying death of a fourteen year old girl, Susie Salmon.  When we meet Susie, she is already in her heaven, looking down on her life continuing without her.  She watches the hardships   her family and friends face in trying to make sense of what happened and search for her killer.  She sees her parents' marriage falling apart, her sister trying her hardest to stay strong, and her little brother trying to understand the meaning of the word \\"gone.\\"  <br /> As the months and years pass after Susie's death, she continues to watch as she begins to see her loved ones get through the grief and move on to begin mending. She watches as her father and sister embark on quests to find her killer. Her father has a feeling all along as to who the killer is, but he cannot prove it.  She watches as her sister undergoes a great feat to prove guiltiness. She looks upon her mother, and the boy she cared for change in front of her very own eyes. <br /> This book not only portrays the horrible death of a young girl, but also the love of the family and the hardships they must face while grieving.  This story is then changed from these things into a suspenseful, touching, and even funny novel about family, memory, love, and heaven. <br /> This book would have to be one of the best books I have read before.  Once I began reading it I had trouble putting it down.  The story of the horrifying death of this young girl is both haunting and sad. Although, hearing of the challenges and feats the family must overcome is both startling and exciting.  Overall I think this book is about love and memories.  Susie's family will always remember her and the wonderful times they shared with her.  The love that her family and friends had for her is what brings this novel to the wonderful ending it endures.  <br />  <br />
B0002KVUKM|4.0|I have heard a lot about this film. I first heard it drew a vacuum. Then I heard it was great. I just watched it and enjoyed a fresh take on some old standbys. Was it perfect? No. Was it enjoyable? Yes. Buy it, and turn your brain off so you can catch all the bits and peices of those 1930's monsterfests.The villagers storming the castle was just one of so many. Anyone who is a bit retentive will pick this apart, I did not take the time to tear it apart. I put this in the same group of movies as Bond,Indiana Jones, and the new Mummy movies by the same director of this one. Pure popcorn. Crunch Crunch
B00000FCBC|3.0|You know,there's a reason why Metallica is now disgustingly referred to as 'Lica,because there's no metal left in them.The heavy metal died in this band on And Justice For All and hasn't been resurrected,and in my bigoted opinion hasn't been back.Overall,Garage Inc isn't a bad album though to me the price is outrageous,which led me to buy the album,tape the few songs off of it that I liked and give the cd to someone I knew couldn't AFFORD to spend $20 on this.For me the highlight of disc 1 was the Mercyful Fate medley,beginning with their version of Satan's Fall which can be found on Melissa as well as The Beginning for interested parties,then directly into Curse of the Pharoahs and A Corpse Without Soul which were both good choices.After that,we go head-first Into the Coven and the medley's closer Evil.As I have said,the medley was great and worth the cost alone to me,but what disturbed me so much was the following comment made by some twit 'Lica fan stating\\"I like Mercyful Fate,but why'd they only write five songs?\\"Sad really.On the second cd we have the entire reason for buying this over-priced slab of plastic to begin with,  the Garage days Revisited EP.This was great then and is still great now,second only to Anthrax's Killer B's for cover tunes.It rocks  as hard in head banging glory as it did at the end of the 80's heyday.The rest of the album is little more than filler material hacked up in a major lack of creativity.I heard 'Lica do a cover of the Ramones 53rd and 3rd once,why couldn't they put that on?It would have been much more entertaining had they done that instead of rehashing their over-masturbated Misfits obsession.Overall,I give this album 31/2 stars,and the 1/2 is pretty generous if you ask me.Get a friend to burn you a copy if you really want it.You'll save yourself some money you could be spending on an SOD album.
B0002OOUP0|2.0|Back in the 60s and 70s, the Rolling Stones would issue a greatest hits album every time they had accumulated anough hits to fill one up. Though far from perfect, the first three volumes of \\"big hits\\" were representative: \\"High Tide and Green Grass\\" (1966), included the non-lp single '19th Nervous Breakdown'; \\"Through The Past Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)\\" (1969), featured the classic non-lp singles 'Dandelion', 'Jumping Jack Flash', and 'Honky Tonk Women'; \\"Made In The Shade\\" (1975) neatly covered the Mick Taylor era a few months after Taylor was replaced by Ron Wood. Allen Klein threw a wrench in the logical flow of hits collections with his unauthorized (by the Stones)compilation of singles and classic album tracks \\"Hot Rocks 1964 - 1971\\" (1971), followed by the far more interesting (to fans) \\"More Hot Rocks\\" (1972), which contained a dozen or so tracks unissued in the US. The Stones themselves issued an even odder item in 1981 with \\"Sucking In the Seventies,\\" not exactly a followup to \\"Made In The Shade,\\" and its predecessors but a strange hodgepodge of edited hits (\\"Beast Of Burden,\\" \\"Fool To Cry,\\") and album tracks, highlighted by three fine unreleased tracks. Strangely, some of the group's biggest 1976 - 80   hits, \\"Miss You,\\" (# 1 in \\"Billboard\\") and \\"Emotional Rescue\\" (# 3) among them, were MIA.  Rather than covering the prolific 1976 - 84 period, \\"Rewind\\" (1984) skipped all the way back to 1971 again for 'Brown Sugar' (by then on four different Stones albums)and omitted over some later hits, offering nothing new in the process(the superb non-lp single, 'Think I'm Going Mad,' released earlier in '84, would have been welcome). Fortunately, all the songs were at their original length. The album, not surprisingly, bombed and has not been available on CD.       Klein was back in 1989 for the flawed (oddly, in the SACD re-issue of 2002, the ALBUM version of \\"Under Assistant West Coast Promo Man\\" was used in place of the single master) but essential \\"Singles Collection,\\" covering 1963 - 71. When Virgin Records signed the Stones and acquired their back (back to '71, at least) catalog, the label issued \\"Jump Back 1971 - 1993\\" - in Europe only - coinciding with the departure of founding member Bill Wyman. For some reason, US Virgin has seen fit to finally issue it here, a decade later, following the hugely successful career-spanning retrospective \\"Forty Licks,\\" (2002), which included several new songs.   So what is the point? It has sold remarkably well, coming on the heels of \\"Forty Licks\\" and considering that some songs, including 'Brown Sugar' are on their umpteenth go-round. But for Stones fans with more than a few studio albums, it is useless. And if you care about rock and roll, you should own the classic albums from which all these tracks were excerpted -\\"Sticky Fingers\\", \\"Exile\\", \\"Some Girls\\", \\"Tattoo You\\", and the underrated \\"Dirty Work\\" are classic. And if you love those Stones albums, you probably would at least like (and find many lesser known gems within) \\"Goats Head Soup\\", \\"Black and Blue\\", \\"Emotional Rescue,\\" and the rest. Each has its own distinct identity, and even past their most prolific years, and since Wyman's departure, the Stones - like Duke Ellington before them - have continued to evolve. The music on \\"Jump Back\\" is fine, much of it classic, but the context is pointless. For casual fans this is a decent collection, but everyone else - stick to the originals!
B00063MBU8|4.0|K, Simple Plan is a band that for the first 2 years of their career could do something no other band could do. They could sit down at any given moment, and write a good, catchy, pop-punk song. That's what \\"No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls\\" was, along with many songs put out for movie sounds tracks, etc. However on their sophomore album, they lose some of their catchy tunes and ear friendly music. Don't get me wrong, \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" is a great album, but it doesn't quite live up to their past works. We still get some of the upbeat feelings in songs like \\"Shut Up!\\" and \\"Jump\\", so it's not a disapointment of any sort. The first 7 songs are by far the hardest, all the kind of songs that remind us of the old Simple Plan, and so I have no favorite between them. The softer second half is not my favorite, and turns over a new leaf of Simple Plan that I'm not sure I like so much. All in all however, it is an album worth buying for all Simple Plan fans.    And it appears the guys are \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" respect from the reviewers who HAVEN'T HEAR THE ALBUM YET. I gotta say to all the bashers \\"Shut up, shut up, shut up, don't wanna hear it!\\"
B0002SROSQ|5.0|Only three words: VERY, VERY IMPRESSIVE! Highlights on both albums include 'There she Goes, my Beautiful world', 'Nature Boy', 'Get ready for love', 'Easy money' and the brilliant 'O children'. Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds have again incorporated a group of brilliant background singers that really add something special to the songs. On 'No more shall we part' it were Kate & Anna McGarrigle, this time on 'Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus' it is the London Community Gospel Choir that does the job. With 'Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus' Nick Cave proves (again) why he is problably the only really great lyricist in todays music industry. The Bad Seeds prove (again) what great musicians they are. If you live in Europe i suggest you to buy this great album set right away, US release is on October 26th.  <br />
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|This Album is Epic this is the only word I could some up with. Tarja Turunen vocals on this album blow Amy Lee out of the water with ease. This band knows how to perfectly mix symphonic melodies with a metal twist, not to mention the opera sounding vocals!  This album is just all around PERFECT!!!!!!!!!
B000021YQV|1.0|Ok Here s how the story goes.The day was March 28 1995 five guys ...Mike Patton,Jim Martin,Mike Bordin ,Roddy Bottum &Billy Gould came out with an album called \\"King For A Day , Fool For A Lifetime\\".These guys were also known as Faith No More.Off that album was a certain song titled \\"The Gentle Art Of Making Enemies\\" A track which was nothing but pure originality and blew everything in its path it was something never done nor heard before.That was BRILLIANT. 3 years down the line a band comes along called System of a Dump ....sorry down .....and they decide ok lets make an album rip off a few riffs from here and there and no one will know.So what we have here is 3 albums ripped off from this one Faith No More song....unbelivable...no ones gonna belive me...so listen for u r self.Everything that soad do from the guitars to the vocals is just ripped off that one song and they ve actually made 3 albums.So what we get is Serj whatever singing bout the armenian genocide like no one would notice he s ripping off The Brilliant Mike Patton.Get a life people listen to good music not this worthless piece of s**t.Long Live Faith No More .Also if u feel there is any variation in this soad album yea that comes from another song \\"Cuckoo For Caca\\".  <br />
B00000F2M4|4.0|I can hardly believe it has been 20 years.  Time sure flies.  This is an excellent film, one that is not only insightful about Sting's creative process, but also many other thing besides.  Yes, we do get to see Jake being born, and get to watch Sting cut the umbilical cord.  \\"Truth or Dare\\" before Madonna? <br /> <br />In the interview at the start of the film, Sting explains \\"I can't think of a film that's about a band starting off, beginning.\\"  And this film not only gives us a post-Police Sting, but also a rather youngish Branford Marsalis, a rather naive Darryl Jones, a rather cool Omar Hakim, and some of the best footage of the late Kenny Kirkland.  Good stuff. <br /> <br />The concert footage in Paris is terrific.  And I just know it would sound AMAZING if the DVD transfer were done properly.  I'm patiently waiting.
B000005RS0|5.0|This is an excellant cd for someone who wants a all-in-one cd experience. The first ten songs include all her popular hits, such as \\"What's Love Got to Do With It\\". The added seven allow you to hear some of her not so common songs, as well as three extended versions. Also, the cover art book contains the lyrics to the first ten tracks as well as some great shots of tina and her famous great legs.
B0002XVQNU|4.0|Probably the closest movie adaptation of the recent Marvel Comics films, Daredevil ended up being a lot better than I thought it would be. Regardless of a dislike for Affleck, he nailed the character and Michael Clark Duncan makes an awesome Kingpin. The only thing missing? No mention of Stick (Matt's boyhood mentor), but it looks like that will be (sort of) fixed in the upcoming Elektra flick. <br />I thought this movie was a much better introductory film than Spider-Man or X-Men, and brought a character who's not as widely known as Peter Parker or Logan onto the big screen. And now with an extra 30 minutes and an R rating? Bring it on! <br />Yeah, there are plot holes a mile wide. Yes, the costume could have been better. But up until now, there hasn't been a closer adaptation from comic book to movie, which puts it a cut above the first Spidey and X-films.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|I loved every bit of it! I could not stop laughing.  It's great someone can still have a sense of humor about this whole terrorism ordeal.  It's nice every once in a while to not take ourselves so seriously.      <br /> <br />South Park Guys have done it again -- this time with puppets.  Gotta watch it or you'll seriously miss out.
B000060K4O|5.0|Still holds up after all these years.<br /><br />Ignore the kids who rag on the effects. The effects are a tertiary concern. Heck, their cheesiness enhances the fun. The purpose of this movie is the humor - nothing else! It's not a sci-fi flick or an action movie. It's a comedy.<br /><br />The famous gag lines are too numerous to count but include:<br /><br />\\"It's true. This man has no __\\"<br />\\"What a wonderful singing voice you must have.\\"<br />\\"Important safety tip. Thanks, Egon.\\"<br />And (of course) \\"It's the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.\\"
B00004TWZF|3.0|I originally saw the American release of this movie several years ago and it became one of my favorite movies.  The Director's Cut restores some \\"holes\\" which were missing from the shortened American version, and this is a good thing.  However, while the music in the Director's Cut (Eric Serra's score) is good, it is very 80s-ish and a bit overwhelming at times.  I strongly preferred the timeless sounding music from the American version.  I was such a big fan of this movie that I would have paid a little extra for both versions to be included in the packaging and am still hoping the American version will be released to us here in America, or at least the Bill Conti score on a CD, as it was quite good.
B0000VD04M|5.0|If you are a fan of the movie ED WOOD, you will thoroughly enjoy this lovingly produced DVD special edition with great extras.  A real treat!
B00005JL3A|3.0|The first 30 or so minutes of \\"Resident Evil\\" is everything you could really hope for in a horror movie: a clever, tightly-plotted, interesting story that keeps you on your toes and makes you wince a little -- in a delightful \\"Oh man, I can't believe they went THERE\\" sort of way -- every few minutes. The movie starts out fast and never really lets you get your footing, while it delivers punch after punch in a very effective progression. If only they could have kept it up the whole way through.<br /><br />However, once the walking dead come out, everything goes downhill fast. And I don't mean in a good way.<br /><br />The funny thing is, it shouldn't be like this. The majority of the concept of the video games that spawned the film \\"Resident Evil\\" is fighting zombies, and the games are fun to play. One would think that the film would manage to re-create this effect easily. It's the opposite that's true, however, as everything leading up to the appearance of the zombies is the best part of the film. Once the re-animated corpses actually start lurching out onto the main stage, it just gets sort of boring.<br /><br />Mind you, \\"Resident Evil\\" did benefit from some rather good stuff. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez both add something unique to their roles. Butt-kicking women are something of a staple in video games and in action films these days, but these two make their characters into more than the stereotype, and they're fun to watch. Milla, in particular, has a truly unique quality about her which she brings to everything she plays, and its on display here too. The music played throughout the film sets the tone nicely. The little hints dropped throughout the movie for devotees of the game series (listen, for example, for a mention of \\"Project Nemesis\\") add a bit of fun to it.<br /><br />But in the end, this could have been better any way you slice it. As a horror movie, it's not very scary. As an action movie, it's not that exciting. Judged against other, similar films (\\"28 Days Later\\" for example), it comes in a bit lacking. Even when compared to its source, the video game by the same name, it doesn't quite measure up.<br /><br />There are those who would say that movies based on video games are destined to failure, but I disagree. \\"Resident Evil\\" has the potential to make for a great film, even a great series of films. If you only look at the first 30 or so minutes of this movie, you can see where that potential lies. The fact that you can stop the movie once the first zombies stumble out of the shadows and not miss much of anything tells you where that potential fell short.r, similar films (\\"28 Days Later\\" for example), it comes in a bit lacking.

B00006F7S4|1.0|The song \\"Golden Age\\" was one of three song snippets played at the end of the Red Sox World Series victory as the FOX credits rolled after the postgame show(featured video of Sox games past and present).   <br />I heard his performance of it on Soundstage or something a while back, so figured I might as well buy the CD when I heard that great song after the series. The guy can really write!  <br /> <br />So you Beck fans should know that millions of people heard a \\"lost classic\\" Beck song while some really cool Red Sox footage rolled.  Nice treat. <br />
B000683VI4|5.0|What a spellbinding LOVE story. The Movie is MUCH better than the book! Produced in a Wonderful way to tell a story so heartwarming!

B00005OCMR|4.0|TRON is the story of a video game designer digitized into the world of a computer where he must overcome the tyranny of a greedy executive in the real world through a confrontation with an oppressive force called the \\"Master Control Program\\" <br />    I remember seeing this film as a kid in the theatre and was awed by the computerized graphics.   Although the action scenes were pretty intense, the more dramatic momemnts were a bit awkward and plodding. <br />    Watching the TRON SPECIAL EDITION DVD today, I find TRON to be not as dated as I assumed it would be.   The CGI effects are simple compared to today, but still attractive and immersive.  Looking back, it is interesting how much the plot parallels the cold war drama of the real world at play during the early eighties. <br />    The DVD transfer is quite good and the sound, with Wendy Carlos soundtrack, is excellent. <br />    Overall, I do recommend this DVD for the good film itself as well as the quality of this DVD transfer.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Mulan is funny, dramatic and great, and I rank it among the best Disney movies in recent history. t`s music also brings a lot of entertainment, being in English or Spanish. Definitely you should watch it with your family.
B000001E8S|5.0|When this album came out I was thirteen years old and had just gotten back to the States from living in Italy for 3 years.  Having never been States-side that entire time, I hadn't heard much news about U2.  So I was surprised when my sister introduced me to \\"Passengers.\\"  Originally I thought the reason I didn't recognize any of the movies was that I had missed a lot of American pop culture from being overseas.  Now I'm even more confused.  I have yet to figure out most of them, but I did find that at least one of the tracks is used in the movie that it is attributed to.  \\"One Minute Warning (from the movie Ghost in the Shell)\\" is actually played at the end of the movie, \\"Ghost in the Shell.\\"  So if this one is true, why is it that the rest of the tracks were not necessarily intended to be associated with the movies listed with them, as the Amazon.com reviewer indicated?  Is there anyone out there who can answer my question?
B00003CXS4|3.0|This DVD tries too hard to be a hard-nosed British gangster movie with quirky characters, but it falls short for exactly this reason - it tries too hard. And it is difficult to follow the convoluted plot. If you're looking for quality, tough, Brit-gangster movies, get Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels or Sexy Beast instead. Those are the real deal.
0767805712|4.0|This movie is about the promise of modern genetics, both passive, reading one's identity from a sample, and active, in changing the physical character of a person-to-be.<br /><br />In this dystopian world, genetic determinism has taken over every aspect of life. Babies are built to order, with soothing assurances from the practitioners that it's really quite natural. A job interview consists of a cell sample - anyone with all the right strengths is in. That excludes people with any molecular flaw, including Vincent.<br /><br />The movie acknowledges that the genes make the man (or woman), but points out that it takes a lot more than just genes. Jerome, one of the genetic elite, is physically and spirtually crippled by accident. His golden genes don't do him a lot of good. Vincent has the flaws we would call \\"the human condition,\\" unacceptable in his world, but personal drive and determination to overcome almost any obstacle. In an elaborate ruse, Vincent presents Jerome's genetic identity as his qualification to enter the highest echelons of achievement. He excels, because of his drive, but that is taken for granted because of \\"his\\" genes.<br /><br />Uma Thurman appears in a prim, starchy role, with a pinstripe business suit and hair in a severe bun. Jude Law plays the grating, spoiled Jerome, showing again that there's more to a man than the meat he's made from. Ethan Hawke does a good job as Vincent, always a moment from discovery and from being stripped of that world's highest rewards. This isn't an action movie, no guns or chases, but good suspense.<br /><br />It's also a reminder that, whatever good the new biomed technologies bring, there is danger, too. It is one role of science fiction, to explore the possibilities without actually incurring the human cost, and this movie does a fine job.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B0006213WG|5.0|This is only Sum 41 album I have liked, the rest just had random good songs (ie, Pain For Pleasure).  Finally Sum 41 shows their true colors with the best track, \\"The Bitter End\\".  Not all the other songs are as intense, and the intro of 88 is a HUGE RIPOFF OF \\"Victory\\" by Megadeth (listen to the bridge).  But is a sweet riff though, so its alright.  Anways, I reccomend all Sum 41 fans along with some Thrice fans and more hardcore fans to buy it was.
B000063WDH|5.0|hello hello, this is my very first review of anything on this website, so please be kind. that being said, on with the show... this is a wonderful cd to listen to. the whole sound of it just draws me. my only gripe is how short most of these songs are. other than that, very very good stuff.
B00005R1N3|3.0|Sorry, but this is a very slow movie, and so long that maybe fall a sleep.
0887307280|4.0|A brand new way to look at starting a new business. As usual, it is information you already have and possess. Without a doubt this a book everyone and I mean everyone should read. Even if you have read Drucker, Demming and about Lincoln Electric. Jefferson was wrong, some truths are not self evident.  All truths are self evident.  The truths needed to start and succeed in business are such.  With the right thinking they are self evident.  Teach tho as things not learned, but things forgot. BUY THIS BOOK.  Not the E Myth Manager.  That is strictly new age.
0312330529|5.0|Shantaram is an epic that reads like a thriller. Its the story of an Australian who lands in Bombay after escaping from prison and then gets pulled into a life of crime and drugs, while earning the love and affection of the people around him. Barring a few long conversations on the bigger meaning of life, the book is action packed and throws the protagonist into several interesting situations, most of which are unique to Bombay. Whether his life in the slums or his forays into the different departments of the Bombay mafia, they keep us absorbed and turning the pages. And just when one thinks that Lin-baba couldn't find anything more interesting to be involved in, it throws him into the middle of the war in Afghanistan! <br /> <br />Though the description of his life in Bombay is romanticized (this is a work of fiction; not a tourist guide!) his love of the city and its people comes through clearly. It doesn't hurt that Gregory also writes wonderfully. His descriptions, whether of people(like Prabhaker and his smile), places(like Madame Zhou's palace), things(like the dhoti) or situations, are a delight to read and have the power of making them come alive in our imagination. There are so many places in this book where within a few pages I had laughed out aloud, shed a few tears and been horrified. <br /> <br />Shantaram is a wonderful read and marks Gregory as a bright new talent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B000008ERZ|5.0|This album deserved to be among the great classics of rock! Great songs! It will always be one of my favourite albums
B000002GL4|5.0|To date,this is the biggest-selling live album of all-time. I went through two copies of this album,one cassette and one 8-track tape. As a destructive child,I removed the magnetic tape from the outer shell of the cassette. The 8-track tape was sold at a garage sale I had years ago. Peter Frampton was promoting FRAMPTON while recording this album. This album was released in early 1976,so this concert was recorded sometime the previous year. Frampton,late of Humble Pie,was driven to superstardom with this album. His 1977 follow-up I'M IN YOU,shows Frampton on the cover displaying his masculinity,thus making him a teen idol. This album spawned three hits,SHOW ME THE WAY,BABY I LOVE YOUR WAY and DO YOU FEEL LIKE I DO?. He covers the Jagger-Richards classic JUMPING JACK FLASH. I really love BABY(SOMETHING'S HAPPENING) which opens this album. Other electrifying live albums that I love are Bob Seger's LIVE BULLET and NINE TONIGHT,the Bee Gees' HERE AT LAST and ONE NIGHT ONLY,Billy Joel's SONGS IN THE ATTIC,KOHUEPT and 2000 YEARS:THE MILLENIUM CONCERT and Elton John's LIVE IN AUSTRALIA. When this album was released,Frampton was in the limelight with A&M Records labelmates The Captain & Tennille whose album LOVE WILL KEEP US TOGETHER was on the pop/rock charts at the time as well. Many classic rock fans will love this album,if they don't already own it. When the compact disc became increasingly popular in the mid-80's,this album debuted on the CD. Because this was Frampton's all-time best-seller,none of his other albums were on CD back then. Now they're all available,digitally remastered,on CD,including this album. A 25th anniversary deluxe edition of this album was released in 2001.
0783225849|5.0|Abe \\"starman\\" Must have an IQ in the double digits. Psycho is one of the most classic movies in horror film history. By the way, it's Ed Gein (not Ed gaines). And when you speak of movies like Halloween and Hellraiser and Friday the 13th. Psycho paved the way for all of those mondern day classics. Psycho Rules. If you have not seen this movie, rent it now!!!!!!
B00005V9HH|5.0|The day after a botched cocaine deal that resulted in a huge explosion in San Pedro Harbor, the only two survivors of the night are questioned by police and U.S. Customs Agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri).  One of them is a Hungarian mobster who was severely burned and keeps yelling the name Keyser Soze.  The other is Roger \\"Verbal\\" Kint (Kevin Spacey), a crippled man who, despite his criminal record, has received almost total immunity by the U.S. government.  Agent Kujan interrogates him about his exploits with 4 other major criminals; explosives master Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin) and his partner Fred Fenster (Benecio Del Toro), and former crooked cop Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne).  Kint tells a very involved story that goes back six weeks to a police lineup in New York City.  It turns out that the 5 men were brought together by international crime lord Keyser Soze, a man who is equal to Satan in cruelty, shrewdness, and evil.  Furthermore, no one who has ever seen Keyser Soze has lived long enough to ID him, except for the man in the hospital. <br />This has got to be one of the best suspense movies I have ever seen.  The plot is very involved and engaging, the actors are perfect in their roles, and it has one of Hollywood's greatest twist endings.  Definitely worth checking out.
B000002UR7|4.0|I think everyone who has given this album a bad review only caught on to Radiohead post OK computer.  Yes it is the most generic sounding album they have put out, but to me it's a good thing.  I liked them when they were making MUSIC, not electronic crap that leaves everyone with a confused look after they hear it.  I only give this 4 stars because The Bends is my favorite by far, but this album certainly stands on its own 2 feet and it deserves credit.  I hate listening to amnesiac or HTTT because they seem to say \\"were radiohead goddamnit, and your gonna love and purchase whatever we make, no matter how crazy or stupid our \\"music\\" gets.\\"  Yes, the band hated creep, because they didn't want to be pideonholed by it, but its still a good song and a great album.  They simply rock on many tracks, and on occasion, i find myself confusing this with The Bends, which is about the best compliment I could give them.
B00005JN4F|5.0|It really cracked me up. Great movie if you wanna have a good time/ a good laugh.
6305922756|5.0|The entire movie is a parody, and Mr. Mastershake was making a parody review of it, the punchline is Edgecrusher who missed the entire point of the movie and takes himself too seriously.  But hey don't take my word for it, go ask Frylock...<br /><br />In any case the movie is great, but a little dated.  Take Mastershake's point in his \\"terrible\\" review, the kiddies may not see the humor, but it just wouldn't be the same if it were updated to a newer music scene.  Could you imagine \\"This is Jennifer Aguilera\\"?  I shudder to think...<br /><br />In summary great movie, go ahead and pick it up.  Then crank it to 11!
B000002GYR|5.0|It is neither important nor wise to rate or give one's opinion about any of Tom Waits' Albums.   In short yours, mine and everyone elses tasts are not important.  Those who feel this album is tripe, have that right to feel so, as do those who feel it is his all time greatest.  In short their both right and wrong.  Look at it this way...If your interested in getting a collection of well rounded (For the genera) Folk and Blues songs then this is the album for you...so is Looking for the Heart of Saturday Night.  If you've heard some of Wait's latest works then this might not be your cup of tea.  Just remember it's only opinion and you should make your own...Perhapes you'll be the type that loves Closing Time and Bone Machine...I certainly do.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Ok, I am watching Monsters Inc. on ABC right now on \\"over the air\\" digital television (DTV).  I guess it is the world broadcast premier and presented by The Wonderful World of Disney.  Unlike the DVD which is 480 aka SDTV, this broadcast is in 720p one of the two forms of HDTV, the other being 1080i.   <br />  This movie is amazingly funny, John Goodman steals the show.  The writers are really dead on with their witty, insightful, humor.  The animation is psychadelic-like, almost like bright colorful liquid.  In terms of a movie that older people can identify with, this is better than Finding Nemo, also a great movie. <br />  Wow.  I'll probably buy the DVD.    <br />  I watch HDTV programing like ER, CSI, NFL Football, etc)and I have seen A Bugs Life broadcast in HDTV as well, and Monsters Inc. in HDTV is visually the most amazing thing I have ever witnessed, period.  ABC and The Wonderful World of Disney have done an amazing job with this transfer into high definition (who knows the original movie might have been created in HDTV to begin with).  I look forward to this being released on whatever high definition DVD format takes over in the near future.  I mean, seriously amazing looking.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|\\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" is the kind of film we rarely get nowadays at the movies. Its the kind of film you can watch several times and it still retains a feeling of freshness and eventhough you know the secrets, watching the film never becomes tiresome. Taken from a Stephen King novella, \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" is not a horror story, eventhough it has truly frightening moments, it is a story about hope, patience and the human condition in general. Director Frank Darabont finds the perfect tones in cinematography, writing and casting to breath life into this story with great flare and intelligence. Like all great movies it never feels too long, every scene feels like it was shot, written and performed with great care. It almost feels as if Darabont is directing for the sheer sake of wanting to make a good movie, this is of course the same feeling we would later get from films like \\"The Majestic\\" and another modern classic taken from a King book, \\"The Green Mile.\\" The framing of the story is brilliant, the photography is cold and rich, really taking us into the Shawshank prison and it's interiors. The performances are superb with Morgan Freeman really standing out as Red, our narrator, but Tim Robbins also delivers an immortal performance as the quiet, intelligent Andy who comes to personify freedom and defiance in a way only a great character could. Darabont's script has a wonderful style to its writing, it feels like literature with a modern twitch. 10 years after it's release (when like \\"Citizen Kane\\" it flopped only to be re-discovered later), \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" returns in this impressive 2 disc set which gives us the film in a beautiful print and documentaries featuring fascinating stories from the making of the picture and interesting examinations at the movie's popularity and appeal to audiences. Few movies really reach out and actually move us, few directors like Steven Spielberg, Oliver Stone, Martin Scorsese, Fellini, Luis Bunuel and Frank Capra have actually given us movies that stay with us, embedded in our memories. Here Darabont does just that. Here is an essential viewing for anyone who hasn't seen it.
B0001AP12G|5.0|As for the reviewer, KarlMarxEmilioZapata! What an idiot. He spouts off about ignorance and racism, and yet he can't read himself. Kanye's name sounds like it's spelled. KAN-YE. It's not Kayne. Maybe he should double check what he's writing before insulting others. What a loser! Don't listen to this guy, he's just musically frustrated and wouldn't recognize a superior album if it hit him in the back of the head! College Dropout is eloquent, fresh, and individual. Kanye is talented and has a lot of creativity left in him. I'm sure his next album will exceed the genius displayed on this one.
B0000TLA9G|1.0|And to all the new fans who think this will give you a good start on the band, think again, just do what I did and buy APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION, at least the band agreed on creating that. To the reviewer below me, I dont believe you are a real G N' R fan, if you were then you would have agreed that this album is just plain pointless. Aside from the fact that the band only made three studio albums (people, you need AT LEAST six) I also dont see/hear any covers at all. I know they are not the best but still, G N' R made two covers albums (G N' R Lies and The Spaghetti Incident) and one live album (Live Era '87-'93) and all I see and hear are the songs from Appetite and the Use Your Illusions. The typical fan would be pretty furious after hearing this. So just take my advice and dont buy this, if you are tempted then just remeber: Your money is going directly to the greedy b@$t@rd$ at Geffen, so they can stuff the emo of Blink 182 and New Found Glory with YOUR CASH! Burn a greatest hits or just buy the three albums, people, it isn't that expensive.
B0002DB52M|3.0|The purpose in writing this comment isn't so much about the film but more about the other people commenting on this film.  It's interesting that \\"arrogance\\" is a topic in this movie, an important topic, and so many of the people commenting here are arrogant.  One suggests that if you \\"don't understand this movie, then go back to your Homer Simpson-esque \\"doh\\" Well, I'm sure that person is the one woman or man sounding board for all movies which are \\"great.\\"  Others go on and on about the irony, the this and that, all the while trying to make other commentators feel \\"stupid\\" if we don't agree.  Well, I'm an educated person, who enjoys many films ranging from \\"art\\" types like Boys Don't Cry and American Beauty to blockbusters like The Terminator and Dawn of the Dead.  I guess I don't see why some individuals are so arrogant and pretentious in their beliefs that their opinion is the only one. <br />     The truth is, in my opinion, any movie is worth debating if you have people on opposing sides.  American Beauty is my favorite movie, but my sister will tell you it's the dumbest movie she's ever seen.  Well...ok....I'm not like some of the people on this board calling her \\"uneducated\\" because she doesn't agree with my choice of movie.  Fargo is the worst movie I've ever seen and TONS of people loved it.  Well...ok...I guess we don't agree again.  Don't claim I'm stupid because I don't agree with your opinion. <br />     Honestly, the arrogance of some people...
0783225857|5.0|Rarely has a film captured the innocence of childhood, the wonderful relationship of a father and his children, or the disheartening prejudice exhibited in this country..TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD Does just that.  Within five minutes, one can see why Horton Foote's awesome screenplay won an Oscar, and why Gregory Peck won his only Oscar for his role as Atticus Finch.  Mary Badham, Philip Alford and John Megna as the children are priceless; Robert Duvall in a small but pivotal role is magnificent; Colin Wilcox as the so-called rape victim gives a dynamic performance, as does Brock Peters as the accused.  Estelle Evans as Calpurnia, the housekeeper, evokes the warmth and maternal kindness of a caring housekeeper, and Frank Overton as the sheriff has a fine moment in the end of the movie.  Not a weak performance in the cast.  Beautifully directed by Robert Mulligan with a fine score from Elmer Bernstein, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD remains a powerful and affectionate cinematic treat.
B000002GB4|4.0|Tommy Shaw's arrival for the 1976 effort Crystal Ball completes the classic line up of the best band that bridged the 70s to the 80s, Styx. Shaw organic style of compositions compliments the rest of the group's style. Balancing the pomp of DeYoung and the fire of JY Shaw's songs fit like a glove. The voice of Tommy Shaw also took the band to another level giving them basically three lead singers. The songs are solid front to back with the freshman Shaw given the title track. Crystal Ball, to me, was more successfull than many othert Styx efforts because of the balance between the hard rockers (Put me On, Shooze), Dennis DeYoung's introspective  \\"This Old Man\\" and \\"Ballerina\\",  and Shaw's organic, soulful, rock rythms. Tag this to the overall quality of each song (there's no filler here)  and you have one of the best the band ever commited to vinyl.
B000268QB2|5.0|Keane's debut CD Hopes and Fears is a great CD with songs accompanied by piano. If you have ever heard of the band Mae or Something Corporate, Keane is a cross between the two. Thier lyrics are soft and the music is brilliant. The vocals are also exceptional. If you are looking for a great new CD this is it!
0399230033|5.0|My 20-month-old and I look at this book at least four times a day. It is the best picture book ever. I am here looking for more like it but first I thought you'd love to have this book for your toddler or baby too.The pictures are so colorful and imaginative, each one is worth a hundred words. We have fun looking at all the animals and child's things that find thier way into the corner's of cages to say goodnight to. There are two side stories as well with the mouse and ballon. Such fun!
B000007U6V|5.0|It all started here. All genres from rap to goa trance to alternative rock owe alot to these Godfathers of electronic music and experimentation. Afterall, David Bowie is quoted saying he only listened to this album once on tour, and Coldplay admitted their hit song Talk was really a cover song with words of Kraftwerks Computer Love - another album to check out. This album is a classic and should not be missed, and is a landmark album in the development of music and will be liked by any true music lover.
B0002G2B2M|5.0|what a wonderful film. Much better than \\"being John Malkovich\\" from the same author, which was pretty terrific. Premise is that the characters attempt to erase painful memories from their minds, but prove the point that those who forget the past are destined to repeat it. Beautifully filmed with imagery that successfully takes you inside the main character's mind. A thinking man's film and one that will linger with you. Should be in everyone's top 10 love stories.
0140557741|5.0|This 54 year old woman found ZOOM to be an interesting lesson in perspective.  There is an important message underlying these illustrations, ie, not to judge and to view the entire picture, if possible, prior to developing conclusions.  A wonderful life lesson.
B0006213WG|5.0|I don't think it's possible for a band to \\"suddenly\\" decide to be taken seriously over a period of three albums. The band has matured a lot from the songs they wrote when they were teenagers.  If Deryck and Steve wrote another \\"Fat Lip\\" --they're like 25 years old now-- I'd be worried.      If you liked the heavy riffs and solos in Does This Look Infected, you'll love this album.  If I was to pick on The Sums for anything, it would be for copying a riff by System of a Down in \\"We're all to Blame.\\"
0385484518|5.0|I cannot fathom how anyone could read Tuesdays With Morrie by Mitch Albom and say that it was \\"mediocre\\" or \\"less than par\\"!! While every one is entitled to their own opinions, I have to say that you are CRAZY and lacking in FEELING and HUMAN EMOTION. If anyone could read this book and not have it tug at their heart strings and have their eyes AT LEAST mist over, than you might want to check to see if your blood is flowing and you have a heart. This was one of the most profound and touching books that I have ever read. While it is said that it took Morrie loosing his life to realize the meaning of life, we are all alive and we don't need to wait that long. Here in these pages are the answers for all of it's readers. I first read this book my freshman year in college and have read it a number of times since. When life gets crazy or I feel like I want to give up, I read this book and I feel so blessed to be alive and healthy and able to live my life exactly how I see fit. I would recommend this book to any and every one. Mitch Albom hit a home run with this book (as well as with The Five People You Meet In Heaven) and any one with a heart could tell you that...
6304938241|5.0|This movie is about as good as it gets on the genru of Love Traingles.  It has a great dose of greed, deception, and sociatel cruelty.  Linus Roache gives a powerful performance in this one.  His role in the main character in this terrible twist of falling in love with the one less immediately thought of.  The Auntie even is in the love controlling game.  I'm sure in true form this went on in Edwardian England.  It goes to show the doubter that one can find his/her true love in a place as romantic as Venice, Italy.  This flick cements ALL can truly do dramatic cinema.  In the end the remaing living two find guilt as a sum of money fall on thier laps as the dead of the triangle leaves money to him.  This movie is great not just for woamn but anyone who appreciates a good Art House, & International genru cinema.

B000000OAC|4.0|As you'll see in my other Queen reviews,I call it as I see it.Queen did some great things,some innovative things,ALOT of unappreciated things,and yes,they did some things that just didn't work. <br /> <br />News of the World,in my opinion does work in every aspect.First,compared to the album that followed(Jazz),the production here is great.You can hear every instrument clearly,and loudly,this is not a subtle recording to be sure.The recording is bombastic as the songs are. <br /> <br />What I like about this album is that to me,everything fits,and Queen are one of the few bands that could make such wildly different genres fit on one album.There is no filler on this album at all. <br /> <br />Everyone knows We are the Champions/We Will Rock You,fine,then comes Roger Taylor's Sheer Heart Attack,a fast and stupid rocker in the best Taylor fashion.I think alot of people would be surprised to associate Queen with this straight ahead 90mph rocker.Spread Your Wings is one of the most underappreciated songs(not just Queen songs)around,a great tune about following your dreams,sung in over the top Broadway style by Freddie. <br /> <br />All Dead,All Dead is a nice downbeat ballad written/sung by Brian May.Roger Taylor sings on his dirty rocker Fight From the Inside,which reminds me how underrated he is as a rock singer. <br /> <br />Get Down,Make Love is a raunchy number by who else,Freddie,and is typically bombastic,over the top,and a bit silly(check out the lyrics!).I love the song,I mean come on,it's Freddie,of course it's going to be SEX spelled with giant neon pulsating letters! <br /> <br />Brian May starts side two(for ye olde cassette and vinyl owners)with his low key blues boogie Sleeping on the Sidewalk.Who Needs You is one of my favorites,a fun and instantly memorable pop tune with spanish guitars and maracas.Maybe Queen and a handful of others could pull this off.It's Late is a big blues rock monster by Brian May,that goes through a few tempo changes and in song structure and recording sound owes alot to Led Zeppelin. <br /> <br />The album closes with Freddie's seductive jazzy lounge number Melancholy Blues. <br /> <br />To sum up,the production is superb and LOUD,even though Roger Taylor's songs may not be as memorable as Freddie's there is no filler here.All the songs fit on this album,and unlike the later years,it seems the songwriting here was more natural and not as forced.Every note,melody and progression seems perfect and assured.These guys knew what they were doing and on this album,they certainly delivered. <br />
B0000BYM3K|3.0|Best track is 'Age of Innocence\\".  It's nicely done, but really doesn't speak to me.  It's not a bad buy if you are a die hard Maiden fan.   <br /> <br />Compared to other Maiden albums, I'd rate it 3rd to last just above Iron Maiden and No Prayer for the Dying.
B000267JQK|4.0|This is a really good album and these guys have an awsome sound.Tracks like \\"needlees\\", \\"f**k it\\" and \\"gasoline\\" all represent a grunge/hard rock sound hard to find these days.The idea to release an addon to the original disclaimer was good to,especially with the bonus dvd.However I bought this album because i did not have the original version of Disclaimer. But what about all those who do? They have to pay an extra 16 dollars to get the dvd and 8 bonus trax. This is clearly a marketing ploy to increase sales especially with the new version of broken featuring amy lee.I consider this to be an excellent album and reccomend it to anyone who hasnt got the original one.As for those who do i feel sorry,but thats how it is with bands and record companies cashing in  where ever it is possibleto.
B00005JN4O|5.0|just saw a sneek peek on oct. 30,2004. this was a beautifully made movie. funny, sad, sincere, loving, imaginative, It had it all. The boys definitly stole the movie. The young Peter is an actor worth watching in the future. Johnny D , excellent as always. Johnny ,you've done it again with a winner! This could possibly be his oscar win!!! Sitting on the bench at the end of the movie with the young Peter was heartbreaking and truly amazing acting by both actors. <br />when tinkerbell starts to die  and her light dims near the end of the movie, it had me in tears right to the end of the movie. Bring your tissues to this one.FIve stars out of five stars. Oscar nominations for sure.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This is such a good movie. I cant even believe it. When I first saw the preview I thought \\"Wow this looks good.\\" When I actually saw it I was just blown away. All the comedy is so good. But beware about 2/3 into the movie it gets very serious. It is still good but the grossest scene in the movie comes then. The movie ultimatley ends with a very funny and satisfying ending. A must have for all comedy or horror fans.
6304493681|5.0|This movies ideas do not come from the Matrix. It came out before the Matrix. The do not come from Blade Runner, but from the author Phillip K Dick. William Gibson invented the term cyberspace in his 1984-acclaimed science fiction novel Neuromancer. If you are unfamiliar with Gibson \\"Johnny Mnemonic\\" with Keanu Reaves is based on one of his short stories. All of these films can fall into the genera of cyberpunk.<br />Anyway this film is does what should be done with animation. It does things that otherwise would not work with a live action film. This film is very heavy on the philosophical side so for some people they may find it extremely boring. To give this film anything less then 4 stars would be a crime just because of the sheer artistry, and the amount of time spent by these people making this project.
B0002OERI0|2.0|They're trying so hard to be musically mature and it's so stupid because they're just so not. Oh wow a tribal drumming intro to a sub-par pop-rock song, that will make it good. Oh and how about a 9 minute sub-par pop-rock song, just drag out those simple mediocre limp energyless riffs that aren't even catchy for 9 minutes and... and... and... I don't even know what they wanted to achieve with that. This album is just stooooooooopid.
B0000041DF|1.0|These are two of my favorite concertos but all I hear on these recordings is a pianist playing too fast and sloppy with no regard to the \\"meaning\\" of the music.  For a great Rach 3 I recommend either Byron Janis or Van Cliburn.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I'll be honest when I first saw the preview I thought \\"Man this looks stupid.\\" The more I saw it though the more I thought it looked good. So on my birthday I saw it and was completely mesmerized. This movie is so hilarius. When I wasnt laughing I had a huge smile on my face. Buy this movie. It is SO HILARIUS. I could identify with Napoleon in being uber geeky.
B00004Z459|1.0|Linkin Park is one of the bands that falls under the genre of nu-metal-which is a genre filled with lame, boring, untalented, unoriginal, watered-down crap. THis album is a joke and does not deserve even a one star rating.  <br /> <br />THis album is filled with horrid guitar playing, from guitarists who know only 2-3 chords and can't play anything hard or technical. The drumming on this album is also horrible. THe singing makes me want to  gouge out my ears to save me from their horrible voices. THe rapper is not singing and has a terrible voice, and the other \\"singer\\" just whines and pathetically screams throughout the whole album.  <br /> <br />What Linkin Park is is a boy band that decided to pick up actual instruments and pretend that they can play, which is all that is required to recieve a record contract in this country. Anyone who thinks that Linkin Park is one of the best metal bands, or are the saviours of metal (both of which I have read and heard) is a ignorant and stupid moron who knows nothing about talent, good music or especially metal.
B00004Z459|5.0|Well, a lot of people don't like this CD as I can see on the review.  <br />LP whines too much? Well, if you want safe bets, why don't you listen to Britney or Christina? There you go, you won't hear them whine. Or you can some gangsta raps, don't you think they are cool with the gangs, drugs, f word every 30 seconds, murders, guns??? Go back to your Led Zeppelin or Metallica. <br />Oh yeah, I forgot the saying, \\"You can't teach old dog new tricks.\\" <br />That's right, old people/generation, move on and keep listening to your old 70s 80s 90s metal.
B0001I55OC|2.0|After having read the Michael Crichton book this movie is based on I thought I might enjoy it for an afternoon viewing.  Well, I was wrong.  The time travel idea has been done and redone and this movie adds nothing of value to the concept.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because Billy Connolly and Gerard Butler are excellent in their roles. <br /> <br /> P.S.   Paul Walker is not an actor.  Someone who loves him should tell him to embark on another career path.
B0002JJBZE|1.0|La mala calificacin no es para la serie de \\"Star Trek\\" original obviamente. Como fantico me parece una estupidez que el estudio no lance este tipo de series conocidas en todo el mundo como una versin estndar para todas las regiones con los subttulos en todos los idiomas posibles. Es prcticamente imposible conseguir la serie original COMPLETA, con subttulos en ESPAOL y Zona 4 para Sudamrica; la versin que se consigue en Regin 4 con subttulos en espaol son de Australia o Nueva Zelanda formateadas para PAL y no para NTSC. El estudio - PARAMOUNT - debera seguir el ejemplo de FOX o UNIVERSAL que lanzan sus series ms famosas en DVD con soundtrack y subttulos en espaol. Seguramente los responsables de las ediciones en DVD de PARAMOUNT no les interesar este comentario, porque seguramente ni lo entendern por estar escrito en ESPAOL, pero por lo menos me sirve para compartir mi frustracin por su actitud con otros compradores de habla hispana de Amazon.
B0000524CY|5.0|I have seen a thousand horror movies and The Exorcist is the greatest of all. Even though it was made in '73, the graphics are excellent and the build up is just fantastic. The modern horror movies are no where close to this masterpiece. A true horror and excellent for curing constipation.
B00000J6AG|5.0|The great \\"iconoclast of techno\\" has returned with \\"Play\\", a masterpiece of an album.  No doubt one of the top 5 albums of 1999 and probably one of the best of the 90s, \\"Play\\" is almost an unclassifiable genre.  A blend of electronica, blues, soul, gospel and techno (among others..), the album's outstanding rhythms and catchy melodies will make you listen to the album over and over.   <br /> <br />The album starts of with \\"Honey\\", a great opener.  The omnipresent piano and guitar plucking will have you loving the song right from the start.  After \\"Find my Baby\\", you get to the album's gem, \\"Porcelain\\".  \\"Porcelain\\"'s violin and piano parts are, simply put, gorgeous.  It's one of those songs that creates such an unbelievable mood and atmosphere when you listen to it.  If you want to really enjoy and get the most out of it, take my advice: put it in your CD player or iPod, sit somewhere quiet and turn up the volume.  \\"Southside\\" features No Doubt's Gwen Stefani, and is a great single off of the album.  \\"Bodyrock\\" is a great dance tune, with its great beat.  Other standouts include \\"Natural Blues\\" and \\"Everloving\\".  The closer, \\"My Weakness\\" is a perfect end to a great album.  No vocals except for some soft chanting in the background, the \\"symphonic\\" parts almost put you in a trance.  Beautiful. <br /> <br />There are certain songs that would make good singles (\\"Porcelain\\", \\"Natural Blues\\" \\"Bodyrock\\", and \\"Southside\\") but the album gets a 5 star rating because, like all great albums, its better as a whole.  Pop it in your CD Player, turn up the volume, press play and prepared to be amazed.
068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes was first published in 1996 (The edition listed here 1999), over fifteen years ago (The author, Frank Mc Court died in 2009) and still it  has stood the test of time and remains a budding all-time classic in literature.<br /><br />I remember waiting for weeks in order to check the book out at the library when it was released,  I tired of waiting and bought a copy, which is long gone. I have two copies now (people have a habit of borrowing it) and have reread the book more than once.<br /><br />The reviews, although old, are well worded and convey the crux and atmosphere of Angela's Ashes very effectively; I wanted to update the fact that all that is said in the reviews is still true today. The most striking thing about reading Angela's ashes is the in the moment and present voice of the author as he revisited his childhood with the childlike eyes, and feelings of a powerless and vulnerable child whose dysfunctional parents controlled his world. And what a tragic world they were all thrust into when the small impoverished family were back in Ireland living in the dark and dank slums during the rainy season. The only thing that rivaled the dark environment was the family dysfunction and abject killer-poverty.<br />The beauty of Angela's Ashes is that the  power of the human spirit comes through, despite the odds.
0156027321|5.0|Pi's adventure story as a castaway in the Pacific with his frightening and lovable companion, the tiger, is a very precious gem. It's graciously written, the compelling descriptions, their style and tempo make you share the ordeal in a most vivid form. You don't drift along, you partake of. Pi's lust for life is contagious. With a book as heart warming and faith restoring as this one and with readers who read it, not all is lost in this world of ours. And children should be invited to read it at school.
B000002UUX|5.0|I was introduced to the mighty Megadeth thru Countdown to Extinction. And when you are introduced to the world's finest metal band thru such an incredible album, you get desperate for more. So I ventured out one day for a walk and happened to come accross a electronics store that was playing the Holy Wars (the punishment due) video. You know what happened then. I ran to the closest music store and bought Rust In Peace. My view of music and heavy metal changed ever since. I was like, \\"Why the hell did I buy those corny Metallica albums?\\" Instantly, Megadeth became my favorite metal band.  <br /> <br />   Rust in Peace is one of the most powerful and soulful metal albums ever recorded. The moment you listen to it, you know that Dave Mustaine, Nick Menza and Marty Friedman have taken full charge of the metal world, unarguably the music world. God Bless General Mustaine forever.
0679720200|3.0|The book provides a philosophical view on society and life during the French rule over Algeria, while enticing the reader with precise descriptions.  It follows the thoughts of a young man who is accidentally caught up in a ruthless murder, while leisurely spending his time on a deserted Algerian beach.  Throughout the book, the reader is able to visualize the main character's predicaments.  Through visualization, one can vicariously feel the same emotions as M. Meursault.  His affectionate feelings towards his girlfriend are expressed through simplified sentences that allow one to establish a connection with what is said  (for men at least).  This book gives me a succinct and effective view on how other people might see life and its values.  <br />     <br />Although short, the book is an accurate account of how arduous, yet unhurried, life was during the time when France ruled Algeria.  In the first half of the book (the book is split in two parts) the author gives a relaxed and laid back aspect of life.  The book moves along at a walking pace; halfway through, no significant event has occurred and the climax is not apparent.  Camus must have been falling asleep for the first half of the book, then all of sudden was awakened by the realization that his boring book desperately needed an exciting and persuasive conclusion.  Like a child looking for the toy in a cereal box, the reader first reads the tantalizing beginning searching for something dramatic, then is disappointed with the climax.  <br />    <br />The second half of the novel portrays a side of life, which has rarely been depicted in books I've read before.  The knowledge of imminent death is presented through M. Meursault's actions and thoughts.  It is absolutely astonishing to see what M. Meursault thinks about his life and civilization in general.   <br />   <br />The story could be extended and become more evocative if Camus had described the murder scene in more depth and given M. Meursault's closestfriends' points of view.  It becomes a one way tunnel of death for him as he establishes his psychological view on how life is meaningless, and by Camus' esoteric statement, \\"[How] the nakedness of man faced with the absurd.\\"     <br />
B0002V7ODI|5.0|to every hick who gave this movie a one-star-rating because he/she fell asleep or didn't understand the plot:<br /><br />this movie is an adaptation from a COMIC BOOK. So what are superhero comic books like? Well? Exaggerating, pompous, glorifying, larger-than-life. That is exactly what the movie became. A very good adaptation from a comic book. So if supehero comic books are not for you then DON'T WATCH THE MOVIE.

0393035158|5.0|I've long held thoughts about religion and it's negative effect on humanity as a whole. Now, finally, a book that gives structure to these thoughts. What a great book! It's current...it's thought provoking...but most of all it's based on fact. When people ask me what I believe in, I can now give them 'The End Of Faith' and say 'This'. Thanks again Sam.
B000063COX|5.0|Iron Maiden are an incredible band with some incredible albums, and this one is no exception - it was the first Iron Maiden album I purchased and remains one of my favourites. While not as accessible as some of the later albums, it is a metal classic that all Maiden fans should own.     Some people seem to find it has punk influences which I can't really hear (apart from the tempo in some songs), but then I've never really liked punk or listened to much of it. It's certainly more metal than anything else.    The highlights of this album for me are \\"Prowler\\" (love the riffs and solos in the middle chorus), \\"Transylvania\\" and of course my ALL TIME favourite song \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" - a sublime masterpiece which in my opinion will forever be 'Maiden's greatest. It is my definition of a perfect song. But while those three stand out for me, there is not a single bad song on here and I can listen to the whole album through without even wanting to skip a song. :)    Anything else I could say has already been said multiple times in other reviews, so if you're an Iron Maiden fan, get it! If you're new to Iron Maiden, start with Brave New World or Number of the Beast - they're the easiest to get in to and both excellent albums.
B000069KGM|5.0|When I heard this record for the first time as a teenager I was stunned. <br />It is great. <br />It is aspecially great compared to the mushy tripe that has marred the legacy of this once great band. <br />Rhino (or somebody)needs to get on the ball and put out a new additon of Chicago II without all the extra junk that clutters the current addition. <br />If you lived through the sixties and have forgotten this masterpiece, then do yourself a favor. <br />Buy the re-mastered CD and find a place where you can crank up the volume to 11. <br />Enjoy.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|This is the purest movie I think I've ever seen.  AKIRA KUROSAWA'S DREAMS consists of eight short stories that do indeed seem like dreams, or at least were seeded somewhere in the deep subconscious.  They also seem to follow a rough chronology - the first story is about a very young boy who goes out to play on a day he shouldn't.  The last is about an adult who visits a utopian village of water wheels.<br /><br /> I think they're pure movies because the visual content is so strong that if they were translated to any other venue, even the stage, they would probably fall apart.  These stories can be appreciated for their openness to interpretation (each story can be understood on more than one level) or simply as a continuous wash of wonderful images.  As usual, I find myself humbled and a little speechless in the face of Kurosawa's genius. Strongest recommendation.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|this is a mad good CD. if you like hip hop, than get this (or download it illegally). anywayz, ya'll know my band and lose yourself are good songs that are on here, and w.e. if you like it get it.
0385659806|5.0|A magical and totally different kind of book.  The only thing that Ive read that was as good was The Bark of the Dogwood (theres that Dog idea again) by McCrae.  But Curious Incident is even better. Christopher's purpose in writing his book is to emulate his hero, Sherlock Holmes (whose logical mind he greatly admires), and solve the case. But his investigations unearth more about the relationships between his family and his neighbors than about the identity of the dog's killer. Unable to decode sarcasm, jokes, or figures of speech (he calls them all &quot;lies,&quot; since they aren't the truth), Christopher faithfully notes down his conversations and observations; though the reader, able to read between the lines, will guess the truth fairly quickly, Christopher's inability to understand social cues makes his struggle for answers all the more affecting.
B0000584V3|5.0|this cd is just perfect every song is of the perfect lenght and they amaze me everytime i listen to them i would recomend this cd to anyone who likes metal i saw them i concert with devildriver and moonspell and they were simply amazing
B00005JMUA|5.0|After the depressing disappointment with Vol. 1, Tarrantino certainly delivered with Vol. 2, as all of the filmmaker's signatures can be recognized: unique plot construction, an uncanny understanding of the dark side of human nature, humorous irony and a gift for creating truly inimitable characters. Many would probably disagree, but the first instalment bordered on the schizophrenic: a cacophony of blood, comic book characters and an infantile plot that an elementary student would dream up - not so with Vol. 2. This film was interesting and well executed. Tarrantino found himself in this film; one can see that he thought it through, leaving his true fans with the feeling that his reputation as a director of genius remains solidly in tact.<br /><br />All the cast put in great performances. David Carradine as Bill was executed with pure panache, and Uma Thurman as Beatrix Kiddo could not have been done any better. One could see she loved playing this character and totally submerged herself in the role without taking it too seriously. Uma is a beautiful woman and the director captured this beauty in every shot.<br /><br />One cannot write a review of this film without mentioning the soundtrack. Director Robert Rodriguez, (One upon a Time in Mexico) has written some passionate music for the film. If you enjoy high intensity, atmospheric Latin guitar, then this soundtrack will send you straight to your `wish list' button at the top of the page. Tarrantino is known for his great soundtracks, but this one tops the list without question. Rodriguez is not only a talented director but also a gifted composer and musician. His music only added to the overall impact of the film.<br /><br />After Vol. 1, my faith in Tarrantino waned considerably, however, after seeing Vol. 2, I have returned to the faithful and look forward to his next project.

6302000823|5.0|Cinema Paradiso is an example of how the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Certainly, this movie could be faulted on its parts: overt sentimentality, manipulation of the viewer's emotions, a gushing musical score, and more. BUT, that's okay because the overall effect is something that we sometimes want and need in a film. Open yourself to this film and you will be overcome by the best of life's passions and nostalgia that lie within you. Bellissimo!     Note: I would like to thank the reviewers before me who recommended not watching the director's cut. I love this film and can't--and won't--imagine it any other way than its original release.

B00005JLZN|4.0|This is a powerful film with a flawless performance from Kevin Spacey. It is ultimately a moral tale, pushing a particular position concerning the death penalty debate. The way it goes about it, however, ensures the audience will walk away from the experience with at least a tiny glimmer of doubt in their minds, as to whether it is proper for a government to execute its citizens. As our judicial system is less than perfect, the system always runs the risk of killing an innocent person, based on flimsy testimony, fuelled by a hell bent desire for revenge. That's part of the problem. Revenge seems to be hard wired in our brains. It is a powerful emotion, so powerful in fact, that it can blind us from the truth. This film illustrates this fact in a very profound way.<br /><br />David Gale is a successful philosophy professor who is an anti death penalty advocate. He is happily married to a beautiful woman with a lovely little boy. Life appears to be good, until he drinks too much at a party and has a five-minute affair with one of his attractive students in the up stairs bathroom. He relents to his base desires and pays the price. This particular student wants revenge because she wants to pass his course without doing the work. The next morning, Gale feels bad, but feels worse later when he's arrested for rape. The student wants revenge and is wholly successful because Gale's life spins out of control. His beautiful wife leaves him and he loses his job, never to return to academia. Even though the charges end up being dropped, he's a marked man. His drinking gets worse and the only job he can get is a management position at an electronics store. Gale's life gets worse, though, when he's old colleague, is found raped and murdered and he's accused of the crime. Ironically, he ends up on death row. Days away from being executed, he requests a news reporter to tell his story. Gale, of course, claims he's innocent, and as the story unfolds, something far more insidious bubbles to the surface, and it becomes a race against the eleventh hour. Is Gale innocent, has he been set up, or did he do it?<br /><br />This is a well-written and professionally executed film with a powerful message. There's no smugness, taking a moral high ground, and beating us over the head with it. It has all the successful ingredients of a top class thriller, building tension all the way to its climactic and surprising end.<br /><br />The Life of David Gale is a class act film and well worth the experience.he surface, and it becomes a race against the eleventh hour.

B0002TT0NM|4.0|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is by far the best book in the series, and in my opinion, is also the best film. I feel that the actors (namely Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson) have improved in leaps and bounds since the Philosopher's Stone days, when i for one was not overly impressed with their acting.  <br />I agree with many of the views expressed here that it is a very good film, but i found it annoying as well. Little things in all three films have changed from the books. Harry's father (in the books) was a chaser, but in the films he was a seeker. Harry's eyes are mentioned numerous times in the books to be green, like his mother Lily's. Yet in the films they are blue. In Prisoner of Azkaban though, the factor that really annoyed me was with the Marauders' Map, where 'Moony' is written 'Mooney'. You might think I'm being nit-picky, but this was immediately obvious to me in the cinema, and i have only watched it once. Surely, J.K.Rowling would have seen the film before it was released? As would the directors, editors and actors? How come nobody picked up on this mistake? Or the previous ones mentioned? I would have thought that J.K.Rowling would have spotted it, as she is the person who knows the Potter universe the best. For such widely publicised and known books and films, i feel that these mistakes should have been rectified. Somebody had to have noticed them, and for me, they detracted from the enjoyment of watching what is, fundamentally, a brilliant story.
B00005JNEI|5.0|From an apodictic point of view, i.e. from a point of view that is free of biases and outside of history, however unlikely the attaining of this state is, this work should not be called a documentary. No references are given for its claims, although the checking of the truth of these references may be very time consuming. As an example of this, the attempt by Moore to connect Karzai to Unocal is not substantiated. It would be very easy to give references to substantiate this claim, but he does not.<br /><br />But from this (apodictic) viewpoint, however fanciful it might be, one can make judgments as to the authenticity of the content of F/911. In that sense F/911 could be viewed as providing motivation to perhaps produce a work that would either substantiate or nullify the claims made in F/911. Such reactionary works have already appeared, and have various degrees of quality, if judged from this (perhaps fanciful) apodictic point of view.<br /><br /> Such a point of view (again, however fanciful) would permit one to make judgments as to the \\"best\\" or \\"worst\\" parts of F/911.  The best part of this work is the attempt by Moore to challenge Senators and House members to sign up their children for Iraq. This of course will not happen. Their sons and daughters do not sign up for combat. That wealthy people do not fight their own battles is an axiom of history. The worst part of the movie is the interview with a few U.S. troops, whose attitudes about offensive operations are presented as representing the majority of the troops stationed in Iraq. In the heat of battle, it is very understandable that they would need emotional props such as hard-rock music to get them through it.<br /><br />When viewing this part of the movie, one naturally wonders what Bush would do in such circumstances. His seven minutes of silence and inaction in the Florida classroom, as portrayed in this movie, instill skepticism in his ability to think decisively, independently, and rationally in situations of stress. One thing is sure, Bush has never had to face the intense emotions of war that these soldiers did. Bush has never had to say goodbye to his wife and children and then march to war. Bush has never had to make on-the-fly decisions in the horrific situations of combat. Bush has never had to bury a loved one killed in war. Bush has never been in a situation where death is constantly tugging at his elbow. This goes for Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, and others in his cadre of yellow abdomens.<br /><br />It would also be incorrect to call this movie \\"propaganda\\", as this is a term that should be reserved to societies whose governments are oligarchies or dictatorships. It is more appropriate in a democratic or pseudo-democratic society to form a new category or framework to characterize works such as these. This new category might be called \\"political aesthetics\\", and would be a branch of aesthetics, for, like art, it sometimes provokes strong emotions in the observer and spawns possibly many new genres. In addition, it can require both detachment and involvement to appreciate it fully. Some works of art require, for their appreciation, that individuals detach themselves from their feelings and prejudices, and in many instances view these works from an ahistorical point of view. Conversely, an appreciation of art sometimes requires deep personal involvement, and requires that one ignore external criticism and the opinions of others. In both cases, one cannot speak of the \\"truth\\" of these works of art. One can only speak of appreciating them. The most important point to remember here is that art can be sloppy as well as ordered, it can induce delight as well as pain, and it can instill respect as well as disgust. This work (of art) is no different than any other.<br /><br />Without extensive research and statistical sampling, it would be difficult to say whether this movie will influence the decisions this Tuesday. But whatever the outcome, this movie willwithout a doubt be remembered as the most iconic of all those made in 2004. Could Moore have made the movie better than what it is? Perhaps. On Tuesday, will we be fooled again (as Moore asks at the end of the movie)? Perhaps. Can we improve on the current administration?<br /><br />Absolutely.ever the outcome, this movie will without a doubt be remembered as the most iconic of all those made in 2004.

B00004Z459|2.0|Shit, why the hell is everyone giving Linkin Park such bad reviews? Mike Shinoda is an excellent rapper. I mean, for god sake, at least he dosen't swear every 30 seconds, like some rappers out there nowadays do. anyways, I reccomend this cd to anyone, especially when you've had a really awful day, and just need something good to listen to.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Rock. Billy Corgan can really Rock. Since he's the one who did most of this album (I'm saying he played most of the instruments himself) I can truely say that he is a musical genious. Truthfully,  this album is something that not everyone gets. Some people will fall in love with it upon their first hearing, while some people will just bitch and moan and complain. I've played this album for many people, I swear to god I've never heard the question, \\"Who is this?\\" as many times as i have with this album. <br /> <br />As many times as I've recommended this album to people as Billy's best work, they always seem reluctant. As many people as I've told to just put it on in the background at work or during a mindless activity, they've always come back to me in love with it.  <br /> <br />Even if all you listen to is hip-hop, soul, country, pop, or whatever, go get this album. This album breaks your preference and shows you what real music can be. With a soft edge that makes you want to break in to tears, with a hard edge that makes you want to break out a guitar, this album is and will always be an absolute classic, no matter who owns or hears it.

0380789019|4.0|This was a very good book. But I think it could have been better.  <br /> <br />The realization of \\"London Below\\" was remarkable and utterly enjoyable. The characters were also fun and wonderfully imagined, particularly the \\"fox\\" and \\"wolf\\" assassins. Also, unlike in American Gods, I found myself having much more fun identifying myself with the protagonist, who was so bumbling and earnest and normal, that in many ways he reminded me of Douglas Adam's \\"Arthur Dent\\". But I feel that Gaiman started out with a premise and a richly metaphorical world and didn't really 'say' anything, (except the issue of enriching one's life through adventure). <br /> <br />I mean, here we are, in a world inhabitated by the left-overs of the \\"normal\\" world, London Above. This is a world that has fallen, through the cracks and which nobody sees, not because they can't, but because they choose not to. The way we pass the homeless on the street, without looking at them. Their existence is outside our realm of comprehension, and Gaiman took this idea as a premise, but then refused to comment on it. The relationship between these two worlds is never thought about by anyone, except possibly Richard. Instead the entire plot revolves around a trapped angel and century old myths. But what I was hoping for was a consideration about what it means to have a underworld, and how it happened. I don't need to have it explained. This book is obviously allegorical. But I would have liked to see this premise touched on more closely. <br /> <br />But that's a minor quip, in a book that certainly succeeds in creating a fantastic world. The next time I'm in any metropolitan area, I'll see things just a bit differently. :)

B0001FR3PE|1.0|Catchy plot; should and could have been a 5 star winner in the hands of a good writer.  Howard fills pages of her books with poorly written pornographic details...smut, in other words, just enough to titillate some readers.  Compare her with Baldacci, with Clark, with Iles, with Higgins.  She's not even in the ball park let alone in the running.  I've looked at two others she's written...same story.
068987474X|5.0|This book came along just in time for me.  As I watched Oprah and listened to those women telling their stories and asking Greg for advice for each of their situations, I found myself yelling at the t.v. screen.  I was quick to solve all of their problems but I neglected to see a little bit of myself in each of their stories!  After reading theis book, I will no longer call my girlfriends via 3-way and psychoanalyze why a guy isn't calling!  It is not rocket science!  He is just not that into me and it is his loss!  DON'T WASTE THE PRETTY!!!!

0060987464|5.0|Annotation: \\"The Long Hard Road Out of Hell\\" is Manson's life as told from the person who would know it best, him. He tells the story of his life starting from the time him and his brother would sneak in his grandfather's basement. Then onto him being in a private Christian school. He tells about how he tries unsuccessfully to get himself kicked out of school, to starting his band, getting signed, and meeting Trent Reznor. Also it reveals the struggles of getting Antichrist Superstar recorded. <br /> <br />Evaluation: The book starts out with the chapter \\"When I Was a Worm\\"; the other two chapters are called \\"Deformography\\" and \\"How I Got My Wings\\". This shows a progression throughout the book from him being a nave, mischievous kid to him changing and coming about to find out who he was, and confronting the struggles, which he faced. Shows a lot of insight into a man, who often tends to be misinterpreted. This book shows another part of him and shares with his readers some of his deepest thoughts. <br /> I thought this was a great book for Manson fans or not. It is very entertaining; there never is a dull part. It is hard to imagine another biography that could be as interesting as this one was. This book has everything from some very humorous that you wouldn't be able to stop yourself from laughing out loud, to some wild, sickening parts. Manson shares some of his philosophies and also disproves some rumors surrounding him. This is a book I would recommend to anyone, even those who don't like to read. <br />
B00005A46T|5.0|The second CD that Slipknot has made is good, but not as good a they're first CD. Most of the songs sound like someone's beating on drums while starting a fire truck engine. No, really. And the lyrics don't make any more sense than the noise, either.    P.S. the review says that I gave it a 5/5 but i should really give it a 3/5
068987474X|1.0|Crikey, we've had the Rules, written by those two pitiful New Yorkers (didn't I laugh when one of their husbands ran off, hahaha!). And now we've got two more daft people peddling drivel to a desperate and lonely female public.      This is male chauvinist rubbish, supported by just another sad woman who'll do anything to get Her Man. I mean, isn't it common sense if a guy acts odd that he's not interested? I particulary laughed when I read the online excerpt about the poor girl who'd been given a guy's number and asked to call him sometime. Why did she feel the need to ask the permission of some bloke she doesn't even know if she should call the fella when he'd asked her to? Perhaps the guy who did this to poor lil Lauren was lazy, but let me tell you it sure beats the hell out of a someone chasing you into a corner with their bad breath. A bit of 'allowing' me to court a man works with me and all of my friends, coz strangely enough, man-the-hunter isn't that attractive anymore and they seem to get so bothered when you say no. I welcome the 'chance' to ask a guy out, and I've had several successful relationships on the strength of being honest with men.    And what's this nonsense about men not liking being asked out by a woman - come off it! I've never met a man, American or otherwise, who dislikes it if he actually likes the woman. Of course there's a big difference between a pleasant invitation to go out for a drink and being bombarded by phone calls, but here's news for you - women don't like that either! We're just brought up to pretend we do so as not to upset the male ego. So we're supposed to simper and flutter till he asks us out? Where I come from, if a woman did this the gentlemanly procedure would be to inquire of the flustered lady if she needed to find the restroom.     So there you go - I'd like to see this impounded courtesy of Her Majesty's Customs if it hits our shores. I read today that this 'book' is being snapped up like hot cakes in the US. Perhaps you lot really DO deserve another four years of the Bush regime.

B00005JNEI|3.0|I'm registered independent, and I'm a filmmaker. I watched this movie, like I watched Fahrenhype 911 with an open mind. Michael's Moore film does an excellent job in portraying a point of view, in a way that is more powerful than Faherhype 911. However, as a filmmaker, and with a bit of research, it is a no brainier that this movie needs to be dismissed as a factual movie.  <br /> <br />I could go through the whole movie to point out how the art of editing was used to manipulate footage so that it would align with a point of view, but I'll only use two examples for the sake of time. <br /> <br />Example 1: <br />Moore showed us a crass statement from Bush that said: \\"Some people call you the elite, I call you my base\\" as he stood there among a bunch of rich folks, despite that the uncropped shot of that speech showed that Bush was sitting next to Al Gore at that fundraiser, not for a campaign, but for a children's hospital where they raised 10 million for the charity.  <br /> <br />Example 2: <br />Moore uses the article from the Washington Post about bush spending 42% of his first seven month on vacation. Those 42%, as it reported in the Washington Post, include weekends, time traveled for presidential engagements, and time spent with foreign leaders at Camp David. <br /> <br />Manipulation of footage was pretty much throughout the movie. As a movie expressing a point of view, as a filmmaker, it was powerful and well done, but as a factual documentary, well, it doesn't hold.  <br />
6305161992|4.0|There is a Reason Dolph Lundgren has been around and it's not because of his incredible acting skills.  The reason is that he is one of the icons of cheesy action films.  So when you get an action comedy such as this it makes for a fun little trip for an hour and a half.<br /><br />The story here is that Dolph Lundgren is police officer on the trail of the iron claw, a group of yakuza run by a man who murdered his parents when he was a child.  He teams up with a wise cracking Brandon Lee and together along with a sexy Tia Carrea they take down the Sinister Drug Lord.<br /><br />What makes the movie funny is that Dolph Lundgrens character is an america who is totally into the Japanese way of the Samurai while Brandon Lee grew up an American Mall Rat and is a fish out of water at some of the places that they go to search for these criminals.<br /><br />Overall this is a simple early 90's action film that appeals to those who like to spend an afternoon hooting and hollering at bad guys getting their @$$ handed to them as well as the usual gratiouse nudity and one liner moments.  Leathel Weapon this is not but for a good low price, you can't go wrong.
B000003CMD|4.0|'Brothers and Sisters' is the last significant work by the Allman Brothers Band.  Their legacy began with studio albums released in 1969 and 1970, and coupled with their classic Fillmore East recordings, released in 1971, they established themselves as the premier southern blues-rock amalgam.  The loss of legendary slide guitar impresario Duane Allman to a motorcycle accident in October of 1972 prompted the band to dedicate their epic 'Eat a Peach' double album to his memory.  The band then began a transition to a country-rock tuning under the tutelage of Duanes surrogate, lead guitarist and songwriter Dickie \\"Lucky\\" Betts. 'Brothers and Sisters' was visited with tragedy as well when bassist Barry Oakley was killed in another motorcycle accident only thirteen months and three blocks removed from the site of Duane's accident.  Oakley's bass can be heard only on the first two cuts from 'Brothers and Sisters', the second consecutive disc to be \\"dedicated to a brother\\". <br /> <br />'Brothers and Sisters' shows few signs that the band was in decline, but they would not release another album until 1975, and by then the significance of losing Duane and Barry would be fully realized.  In particular the loss of Duane ripped much of the heart and soul from the Brothers, and Betts could only mask the rupture for so long.  Despite their tragic demise, 'Eat a Peach' and 'Brothers and Sisters' represent the last of the cream from the Allman Brothers catalog. <br /> <br />'Brothers and Sisters' features the best-selling single ever released by the band, though they were never known for their Top 40 successes.  'Ramblin' Man', a number penned and sung by Dickie Betts, reached number two on the national charts in September of 1973.  Betts also contributes the final three songs on the disc, the most notable being 'Jessica', which many people regard to be one of the Allman's best songs, and certainly their finest instrumental.  Another Betts composition, 'Southbound', is sung by Gregg Allman, and possesses a sound much more in the traditional ABB mode.  Betts final number, 'Pony Boy', is the purest country song on the disc, and the most laid-back number offered. <br /> <br />Brother Gregg Allman contributes three songs.  The opener, 'Wasted Words' is another Allman classic, with Betts slide guitar sounding errily reminiscent of lost Brother Duane's specialty.  I caught the ABB fall tour in support of 'Brothers and Sisters' at Cobo Arena in Detroit in 1973, and they used 'Wasted Words' for their opening number.  I remember that Gregg opened the Cobo show playing rhythm guitar on this track before settling down behind his organ for the rest of the evening, and I note that he plays rhythm guitar on this studio version as well.   <br /> <br />Gregg's two other compositions are traditional blues numbers.  Both 'Come and Go Blues' and 'Jelly Jelly' start out slow and build nicely and evenly in intensity.  They aren't the best songs Gregg has ever written or performed, but they're sturdy in their own right and serve to maintain the band's trademark sound from drifing too much towards Nashville.   <br /> <br />The liner notes are sparse, offering three listings of the songs but no running times, although the performers are listed for each of the seven tracks.  Sadly, the disc doesn't even offer the 'family portrait' photograph offered on the inside of the gatefold in the vinyl version.  It's disappointing that the artists and producers don't do more to beef up the offerings on classic rock albums.  Is it really that much to offer a couple alternate takes, bonus tracks, lyrics, and some liner notes?  It would seem the least they could do for customers who may be purchasing these same songs for the second or third time around.
0393035158|4.0|It's about time someone broke into the mainstream with this information, which has been circulating in the human mind for centuries, via great thinkers such as Thomas Paine, Robert Ingersoll and more recently Osho Rajneesh.  These \\"anti-religious\\" concepts, as having emanated from the great philosophers dating back thousands of years, are thus not \\"new\\" but certainly necessary.  The Net has also for years provided such opinions, via other great thinkers, with a large number of \\"infidel\\" sites promulgating this vision for a long time.  As they say, there is nothing new under the sun, although some will find Harris's work disturbing and perturbing, of course. <br /> <br />Hats off to Sam Harris--it's hard to imagine how he pulled it off to get such incendiary thoughts out to the masses at large, but his book is certainly effective and worthy.  I am especially impressed at the tone, which does not attempt to smooth ruffled feathers.  Although I wouldn't wholeheartedly agree with Harris's perspective on mysticism, I would concur that there is a difference between a mystical experience and a religious one, and that, while the typical organized religion needs to go the way of the Dodo, humans should always be free to exercise their own minds as they see fit, so long as they are not harming others with the manifestations of their thoughts.  The focus on preventing mysticism from being lumped in with \\"religious\\" thought allows for a large degree of protection against the type of 1984 mind-control that would accompany--and HAS accompanied--this kind of censorship. <br /> <br />I was reminded of such books as \\"The Dark Side of Christian History\\" by Helen Ellerbe, \\"Holy Horrors\\" by James Haught and \\"The Christ Conspiracy\\" by Acharya S, among others.  These books likewise expose the constant danger and deception of religion. <br /> <br />
B000002KLP|5.0|For such a brilliant musician (and 26 years after his debut, there can be no doubt of his pop mastery), Prince has been a mighty inconsistent album artist.  Undoubtedly some of this owes to the fact that he's got too many ideas - genius can be unruly.  But beyond that, what hampers the greatness of many of his best-known and best-received efforts for a college student born the same year \\"1999\\" was released is that the oft-brilliant songs are mired in '80s production gunk.  Seminal though it may be, the \\"Purple Rain\\" soundtrack is so drenched in processing and outmoded digital echo that, on first listen, it barely sounds musical at all.  Prince may have been ahead of his time, but few artists have been so much OF their era that the greatness of their work is discernible only through repeated exposure.    \\"Dirty Mind\\" is comprised of recordings originally intended as a demo, and as such it is remarkably free of the aforementioned excesses.  At barely a half-hour in length, there's hardly room for the flab that pads many of his later full-lengths.  What you're left with is a prime slice of knotty, minimalist, RAUNCHY funk rock.  Listen to \\"Head\\" and \\"Sister\\" in particular and you'll be amazed that Warner Bros. had the guts to put this out in 1980, a good half-decade before the rise of hardcore rap and the PMRC's campaign to put warning stickers on albums.      After two unsuccessful tries with \\"Purple Rain\\" and the much-beloved double album \\"Sign O' the Times,\\" I finally came around to Prince with \\"Dirty Mind\\".  Aside from synth solos on the title track and \\"Head\\", he plays every instrument on the record, and the stripped-down production just bolsters the shock of his knockout chops.  Prince would emerge as a major star two years later with \\"1999,\\" but in my opinion this is his best album.  The most effective demonstrations of his genius outside of this record are the compilations \\"The Hits/The B-Sides\\" and the unfortunately out-of-print rarities collection \\"Crystal Ball,\\" which can be had pretty darn cheap as a used item considering it's 3 CDs long (4 with the 'bonus disc', actually).  Why he's been unable to make a record that's great start to finish in the last quarter century is beyond me, but if you're curious about the little guy \\"Dirty Mind\\" or the hits collection are fine starting points.
B00005JMAH|5.0|Let me start off by saying this is the best movie in the harry potter series. I know I was not in it, but it went above and beyond all fans' expectations. First, the kids' growing maturity is evident because, well, that part really isn't acting. It is these kids become more mature, better actors than they were before. Second, This book seemed to be the favorite of every hp fan, so there was no doubt that the movie would be the favorite. I shudder at this fact, wishing that I had been Lupin instead of Lockhart. However, I must say, Lockhart was an extremely enjoying role to play. Third, the first movie spent a lot of time unwinding the plot, the second movie had a little more unwinding, but this movie, was everything unwound, just more deep, dark secrets of harry's past. Last, the suspense in this movie is amazing, it is becoming more 'PG' with every movie, as it should.  The scary moments are scarier, the creatures are freakier, and everything is just better over all. I definetely give props to Alfonso Cuaron for creating such a well-crafted film. Bravo, Alfanso, Bravo! <br /> <br />Sincerely, <br />Gilderoy Lockhart
B0000C23DO|5.0|Yes, I know, I know--it's impossible to put the best of the entire career of The Grateful Dead (now calling themselves The Dead) on just one CD. But, this is an impressive try; and it makes for an excellent introduction to the band for a newcomer. The CD also represents their work through not just the Warner Brothers Records years but the Arista Records years as well--a nice plus!<br /><br />This CD is best for the newcomer for the following reason: it's just too brief a compilation. For example, the more psychedelic type of song they performed is absent here; and I agree with the reviewer from Norway who writes that the quite a few of the songs are from just one year: 1970. In fact, the entirety of the song set is from 1967 to 1987. Where are the songs from The Dead as The Warlocks? 1965? 1966? After 1987? There's only one live set on the CD: \\"One More Saturday Night,\\" recorded live in 1972 but presented here without audience reaction. A shame since The Dead built such a solid reputation on their live concerts! But--remember this--you can only get so much on a single CD; perhaps I am being too harsh.<br /><br />After all, there are some awesome songs on this CD that demonstrate the remarkable talent of The Dead and their almost unique effect on their fans. (People actually quit their jobs to follow the band!) You get \\"Truckin',\\" \\"Touch Of Grey,\\" \\"Sugar Magnolia,\\" \\"Casey Jones,\\" \\"Uncle John's Band,\\" and the CD ends with the beautiful \\"Ripple.\\" Other songs I thought were extremely special and beautiful are \\"U.S. Blues\\" and \\"The Golden Road {To Unlimited} Devotion.\\"<br /><br />Other great aspects of this CD include fantastic--and I mean fantastic--liner notes. There is an extensive introductory history to the band written by James Austin. There are wonderful black and white photos of the band taken over the years. The song credits are very well done. There's also an insert advertising Dead merchandise I myself might order! GRIN<br /><br />The quality of the sound is excellent; the sound is in a form of high definition digital sound manufactured by Microsoft. You get links to the website for the Dead and Rhino Records as well.<br /><br />I recommend this for Dead fans who don't have it yet (but I know they do)! Because The Dead wrote a certain type of music, I also recommend this CD for fans for folk music, country and maybe even blues as well. This is a great CD overall and I recommend you get it and enjoy!sound is excellent; the sound is in a form of high definition digital sound manufactured by Microsoft.

078322608X|5.0|I had no clue what to expect when I walked into the theater to see this movie.  What I saw is probably the best performance of Bruce Willis's career.  His interpretation of a time traveler from a bleak future dealing with the beauty of the past he had merely a taste of as a child is mesmerizing.<br /><br />It also showed me that Brad Pitt wasn't simply a pretty face.  In fact, I found him quite repulsive in this movie.<br /><br />As usual, Terry Gilliam has a wonderful eye for the visual.  While I understand that he went through a great deal of self-doubt while making this film he delivered one of his best works.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This movie kicked even more ass than the first one. The first one, rocked... but they had to give a background on the characters. The new one...

(Stay Lee, pay attention, you dolt!) Pyro sets the stage for his future badness (Your a god among insects, don't let anyone tell you differently.) Kick ass movie. See it in the theater; own it when it's released.

B00005OCMR|2.0|Tron. The original Sci-Fi fantasy about computer games, and Virtual Reality. A video game designer trying to prove a big time executive stole his big idea, and is sucked into a corporate mainframe where programs are personified counterparts of their writers and \\"users\\" are subjects of religious faith. This movie set the pace for all future movies of this type. Tron also received Academy Award Nominations including Best Sound, and Best Costume Design. I'll give this credit for being the first of its kind, but watching it recently, I had never remembered the acting being so bad. I recommend this movie only if you want to relish in the history of sci-fi, but otherwise, skip it.

038551123X|5.0|Darkly Dreaming Dexter, $22.95, deftly documented by  Jeff Lindsay -- is the best hardback I've read this year! In fact, I think it's the best debut book I've read since 1985, when I found Jonathan Kellerman's  When The Bough Breaks upon the shelves of the then new Muscogee County Library. Lindsay's greatest strength as a writer? Hands down, it's the witty narrative. His paragraphs molder with a certain type of anticipation, a bubbling froth of things that are dark and dreadful, screaming in a murky corner of your id. The novel glitters with glib humor. At times it even crackles with originality. The tome showcases the career of charismatic  Miami blood-spatter analyst Dexter Morgan. Dexter is, in literature, what they call an anti-hero. He's a protagonist that lacks virtue, lacks good moral qualities, lacks even any notion that he's human -- but he does possess charm, persuasiveness, a regular job and an honest to goodness girlfriend.<br /><br />Dexter is a wolf in sheep's clothing - a polite serial killer - and he also happens to work for the  Miami police department, where he lurches and manuevers behind the scenes almost completely undetected. One or two people in Lindsay's Miami know something isn't right with Dexter, but they can't exactly put their finger on what that is. The basic premise of Darkly Dreaming Dexter may be abhorrent to many readers, but Lindsay somehow manages to pull off a difficult task. As a character, Dexter audaciously trumps J.P. Keller, the cool but callous hit man found in the crime writing of  Lawrence Block. And as a protagonist, Morgan is even more heinous, more memorable and suavely stalwart than even Hannibal Lecter, the  Thomas K. Harris creation.<br /><br />Dexter will most likely fuel a series of blockbuster books, you can be assured of that. When  Doubleday published this novel, they effectively put several authors on notice. You better up your game! If I were a  Michael Connelly, a  Jonathan Kellerman, a  Dean Koontz, a  James Patterson, a  Stephen White or any other well-known writer of crime, mystery, or suspense fiction -- I would be fuming with envy. I might even start swearing, because Lindsay is that formidable a talent.<br /><br />Starting off, Dexter is called to the scene of a bloodless kill by his sister Deborah -- a Miami Vice cop -- who just happened to be on a nearby sting when the body was discovered. Deborah called him chiefly because she wants in on the action. She senses an opportunity to get out of Vice and move over to the Homicide squad, but she'll need Dex's help, because she doesn't have any real instinct for what the job demands. Dexter believes the body is one in a series - tied to a perp that's since been tagged The Tamiami Slasher. The crime is especially perplexing to Dexter. Mainly as in, how was that done? And Dexter is certainly jealous of the killers trade craft. While desiring to solve the crime, Dexter silently wonders if he should hunt down and dispatch the killer himself, with his own unique brand of justice. Yes, Dexter is a certifiable loon and a bundle of nerves for great swaths of the book, but it's amusing being inside his head.<br /><br />Solving the crime is a given, and by the time the book reaches its colorful climax, we've come to know Dexter and his macabre sense of humor quite well. During the course of Deb and Dexter's solving of the murder spree, they encounter resistance from Homicide Detective Migdia LaGuerta and Squad Sergeant Doakes, a duo that have a vested interest in protecting their careers, and whom both enjoy facing off with Deb, and bringing Dexter to the brink of a near nervous breakdown. In the end, however, one of the opposing foils in this duo meet their unmaker, receive their just desserts as the saying goes, and the survivor lives to fight another day. And while solving the Tamiami Slasher case, Dexter hones his sense of self awareness, discovers real emotions, polishes up on his office politics, and more sharply developshis sense of \\"Vigilanteism\\" because of the predicaments he's being placed in. Also, because Dex is pursuing a more skillful killer, and because he must avoid detection of his own crimes, while the women in his life, like Rita, are trying to trip him up, Dexter faces a great internal struggle. Poor Poor Dexter, the best-dressed Monster in all of Dade County. I don't think he expected what he found at the Miami dockside, but he does save his sister. As far as I'm concerned --  Darkly Dreaming Dexter then comes to a rather rousing and tidy conclusion. And I don't think Lindsay telegraphs the ending of the book either.<br /><br />So I'd say -- aside from Lindsay's penchant for alliteration -- the cryptic tilt of the scene setting first chapter, and an overabundance of great narration, I could find no documentable dings in  Darkly Dreaming Dexter. But I did wonder if Dexter drove a Dodge Durango. Each character in Lindsay's book is entirely plausible. The characters behave as they would in real life. They utter phrases you suspect they might actually say. They don't do anything that goes against type for the character. However, if I could offer only one piece of advice to Jeff, I would say simply, \\"work on variety in the way you attribute the dialogue.\\" Now there's an opportunity.<br /><br />Lindsay makes interesting choices, as an author, in  Darkly Dreaming Dexter. I highly recommended this volume, but I can't figure out why Doubleday failed to market it as a genre book. Lindsay is masterful, in the way that he weaves  Miami into the background. And like  Lawrence Block, he possesses an unnaturally keen gift for making unlikable characters completely palatable. He also has Block's same knack for selecting suitable names for his characters, that are appropriate given the setting. He's wise enough to give every character a dilemma. He has no trouble juggling a large number of characters in the book. And he also blends Spanish into the novel, for true authenticity and to great effect. Certain elements of Darkly Dreaming remind me of two films about serial killers: Frailty and Se7en. Two thumbs way up for  Darkly Dreaming Dexter, a work that eschews conventional formulas. As an aside, I think the cover art on the hardcover works, but I prefer the cover art that they're going to use for the paperback. Since paperbacks are released earlier in the UK than in the US, you can find the alternate cover art on the listing for this title at amazon.com.uk.<br /><br />Lastly, I'd like to say that I chatted up Jeff at the  Gateway store earlier this year, before it was shut down. I just had to speak to him, because he was wearing such an attention-getting black tee with a large skull and crossbones on the front. Additionally, the words \\"Metro Dade\\" were emblazoned in an arc above the red and yellow skull, while below the colorful visage, in larger letters, the shirt riding over his gut gleefully declared \\"Homicide.\\" In fact, that's the same shirt that Jeff sports on the novel's black and white photo on the inside flap. When I asked what his name was, and he told me, I thought it sounded mighty familiar. But I couldn't immediately place it. All I could do was smile and offer my card.<br /><br />Let's just say that since that chance encounter, I've been trying to ferret out where I knew him from. I've mulled it over extensively since purchasing this novel. And now, I might be wrong, but I have no trouble in saying that I'm firmly convinced that I knew Jeff Lindsay, his brother and family, about 25 or 26 years ago. We may have attended the same grade school or junior high in  Longwood or  Valparaiso, near  Eglin Air Force Base, and we may even have possibly lived in the same housing area, Poquito Bayou, in the  Florida panhandle. There may be a miniscule chance that I've gotten him confused with three other families that had phonetically similar \\"sound alike\\" names -- either the Lindens, the Lindermans, or the Lindmans -- but I do believe that I am correct. And if I'm right, we both have brothers named Robert. I'll have to make it a point to inquire of the author sometime...Dreaming remind me of two films about serial killers: Frailty and Se7en. Two thumbs way up for  Darkly Dreaming Dexter, a work that eschews conventional formulas. As an aside, I think the cover art on the hardcover works, but I prefer the cover art that they're going to use for the paperback. Since paperbacks are released earlier in the UK than in the US, you can find the alternate cover art on the listing for this title at amazon.com.uk.     Lastly, I'd like to say that I chatted up Jeff at the  Gateway store earlier this year, before it was shut down. I just had to speak to him, because he was wearing such an attention-getting black tee with a large skull and crossbones on the front. Additionally, the words \\"Metro Dade\\" were emblazoned in an arc above the red and yellow skull, while below the colorful visage, in larger letters, the shirt riding over his gut gleefully declared \\"Homicide.\\" In fact, that's the same shirt that Jeff sports on the novel's black and white photo on the inside flap. When I asked what his name was, and he told me, I thought it sounded mighty familiar. But I couldn't immediately place it. All I could do was smile and offer my card.     Let's just say that since that chance encounter, I've been trying to ferret out where I knew him from. I've mulled it over extensively since purchasing this novel.

B00005JL96|5.0|In all honesty, I wasn't expecting much from this movie.  When I saw the advertisements before it came to the theater I just thought Disney was reaching...overextending itself.<br /><br />Happily, I was wrong.<br /><br />This film kept me giggling from start to finish.  The characters were funny and real throughout.  Lilo was such an oddly charming child and Stitch...well...he was just weird enough to be interesting.
B0001FR3IG|4.0|What a great movie for Halloween!! This one is definately a thriller!! This is gonna make you jump out of your seat at times literally!! This is weird at times...but hang with it...it will end with a bang!!!! Something totally unexpected!!
0790729393|5.0|While I have seen many movies that were incredibly entertaining and many that were heart wrenching, I have seen very few movies that were gut wrenching.<br /><br />This is one of them.<br /><br />What's the difference between \\"heart\\" and \\"gut\\" wrenching?  A heart wrenching story makes me want to cry.  A gut wrenching story makes me want to vomit.<br /><br />In this case, that's not a bad thing.<br /><br />I understand that this movie came under fire for the protagonists' machinations towards revenge.  I see that and can understand that some may see the movie as supporting such actions.  Desiring revenge in something I have, over the years, become very wary of.  I feel uncomfortable when I give so much negative thought and emotion to someone.<br /><br />However, this is still an incredibly powerful movie.  The story is tough and taut, the acting is incredible (even the younger actors).  And, in the end, it impressed on me more good than ill.
B00008DDRX|5.0|I first saw this film when it was released, some 30 years ago. At the time it got so-and-so reviews, i.e. it was described as a good motor racing film, but poor on plot and psychology. I just watched the dvd version for the first time in 3 decades and was surprised how good it still is. The racing scenes are better than any other film ever made and they are credible (many are real scenes from the actual 24 hours of Le Mans, shot from a specially converted racing Porsche)- apart from the last 2 minutes - contrary to your average American motor racing film (think of Stallone ...). This film is not great on the acting front - McQueen is rather wooden throughout and psychology always ranks second to the cars. However, the film is also very good at evokinging an atmosfere around the racing track, such as showing the go-karts racing at 10% of the speed of the real racers, just yards away. Best of all is the start of the race, which is spine-tingling This film is not just for motor racing fanatics (the motor racing itself certainly merits 5 stars), although they will enjoy it most.
B000000OSW|5.0|From the moment the CD began I had goosebumps.  It showed an incredible range of emotion and creativity.<br /><br />True story:  It was actually given to me by a friend who worked at a radio station.  It was a promotional copy and he had not listened to it before giving it to me.<br /><br />After hearing the first track, he slapped his forehead, Homer Simpson style.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|Mark Knopfler returns to the fertile ground of Richar Thompson-esque folk in Shangri-La, his fourth solo album.  There is, however, a little of the old rock and roll fire here.  The guitar has returned to the fore on several of the tracks, and there are extended solos that rival anything he's done since Dire Straits disbanded.  Where \\"Ragpicker's Dream\\" was mostly thirties-style blues and folk, \\"Shangri-La\\" has the feel of late Dire Straits, circa \\"On Every Street,\\" or perhaps \\"Golden Heart.\\"  Thematically, too, this is a very different album than \\"Ragpicker's Dream.\\"  Where that album concentrated on the beaten-down working man, the Depression-era hero of the tracks and bars, the first few tracks of \\"Shangri-La\\" approach the men who beat them down in the first place.  \\"Boom, Like That\\" is about the man who founded McDonald's, Ray Kroc, and how his original concept was turned into a sea of mediocre identical cheap eateries.  \\"Sucker Row\\" is about every young wolf in the business world, emulating the heartless men above him in an effort to get ahead.  I think there's a kind of veiled reference to the founding of Las Vegas in there, too.  The title track is a gem of a love song, with guitars at the end that made me close my eyes until the last note went away. <br /> <br />The remainder of the songs range from the traditional-sounding \\"Donegon's Gone\\" to the Ragpicker-ish \\"Stand Up Guy.\\"  There's some uneven songwriting here, and I have to agree with the Amazon reviewer's assessment of \\"Song for Sonny Liston,\\" in that it didn't reach the level of most Knopfler songs, with their eye for dialog and atmosphere.  I interpreted the last track, \\"Don't Crash the Ambulance,\\" as the sly advice for one leader to his successor, as he leaves the office (perhaps the Oval one?) for the last time. <br /> <br />Overall, Knopfler delivers his usual grace and musical skill to this effort.  Well worth the price for his fans, although not likely to attract new listeners not used to his particular brand.
B000002IOW|5.0|I once tried to pin down my favorite Rush album.  I eventually gave up.  The material they have released is incredible and spread out over 3 decades.<br /><br />I will say this, \\"Presto\\" was a breath of fresh air.  The 4 albums that preceded it (\\"Signals\\", \\"Grace Under Pressure\\", \\"Power Windows\\" and \\"Hold Your Fire\\") are all very good in their own rights (P/G being towards the top of my favorites) but they lacked the \\"umph\\" that albums like \\"2112\\", \\"Permanent Waves\\" and \\"Moving Pictures\\" had (in my humble opinion) in abundance.<br /><br />It was as if Rush kicked in the door (again) saying; \\"You doubt our ability to rock?  Take this!\\"<br /><br />I saw this tour twice.  It was second only to their \\"Vapor Trails\\" tour in 2002.
B0002YLC24|5.0|This film is that extremely rare thing - a sequel even better than the original. And finally a sexy, romantic movie for someone with a mind. It is hard to believe that such films are made and it makes me very happy to see it succeeding out there.
B0002KVUKW|4.0|First of all, this is not a horror. This movie is a non-stop action, adventure romp which Sommers has proven time and again that he can provide successfully to his audience. Don't try to analyze this film. Don't try to dissect the relationship between the characters. Just hunker down with a bowl of popcorn, turn down the lights, turn on the surround sound system and enjoy 2 hours of pure visual delight, edge of your seat action and Alan Silvestri's bombastic score.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I could not like Bush less, or agree with the sentiment of this film more, but I found it's methods irresponsible and sloppy. I am happy that Moore is not making films for the \\"other side\\" but he need to become more accountable and thorough as he is now only preaching to the choir. There is a slight Conan O'Brien sardonic, aging college boy' irony meets Enquirer tabloid sensibility. Stay with us on the left Michael, but do so with a litlte more responsibility.
B000002MZ9|1.0|Which is saying a lot. Thrown together quickly without the inspiration that made Ragged Glory a classic.  Act of Love is horrible, the end of the album is a complete disaster.  I've owned this CD two times, and given it away both, the only NY production I've ever abandoned (including Reactor and Journey Through the Past).  Let's run this out of circulation and re-issue Time Fades Away!
B0002OXVDW|4.0|I loved finally seeing the That's Entertainment Trilogy out there on DVD. The transfers are great and they are as wonderful as ever. I delight at the extras as well, but most have been released before. The That's Entertainment Three release on VHS had the same extras on there and I wish there were some new things. But, I am so happy that they are out at all!
0689859368|5.0|The Spiderwick Chronicles are the most charming little books imaginable. There is something almost Victorian about the quality of their presentation. Beautifully designed covers, outstanding illustrations and a watercolour frontispiece piece all help conjure an aura of days gone by, when faeries were the standard reading matter for the young. <br /> <br />The writing has a clarity that will suit young readers whilst not being overly simple for slightly older readers. The vocabulary is good, but not off-putting for those still feeling their way through books alone. Pages are small - less than half the amount of words per page found in a standard children's book, enabling younger readers to really feel that they're progressing.  <br /> <br />Each book is divided into 7 chapters - making it ideal for a week of bedtime stories. Furthermore, what really makes these little books special is the stunning quality of the line illustrations. The artist dedicates his work to Arthur Rackham - and it is clear that Rackham has been his inspiration. There is hardly a double-page-spread without some little picture and there are plenty of highly detailed full page illustrations too - yet again making it perfect for bedtime reading. <br /> <br />Although the style of the books is intentionally retro, the story is anything but. The plot of the first book: 'The Field Guide' revolves around the three Grace children; nine-year-old twins Jared and Simon, and their older sister Mallory. They move into their Great Aunt Lucinda's derelict house - and soon discover that it is not quite as empty as they thought. While trying to trace the source of the mysterious noises within the walls, Jared discovers a strange hidden room in which he finds an old hand-written book belonging to his long-lost Uncle, Arthur Spiderwick, which contains the terrible truth about the faerie world. Once he opens it, his life will never be the same again. <br /> <br />This book is the first in a series of five. Although the stories revolve around the magical inhabitants of the faerie world - don't assume that these books are just for girls. Jared, the main character, is very much a boy - into fighting, getting expelled from school and generally being difficult! Even the faeries are not the twee Enid Blyton variety - neither are they the like the feisty gun-toting elves of the Artemis Fowl books. No, they seem much more realistic: Strange, magical, slightly dangerous and determined to stop at nothing to protect their world and reclaim Arthur Spiderwick's powerful book. Subsequent stories include a whole menagerie of mystical beasts, including: goblins, griffins, unicorns, boggarts, ogres, dwarves and elves. The Spiderwick story continues with: Book 2 - 'The Seeing Stone' <br />
B00008EY65|4.0|'Hellboy' has every good element that makes a great film -- interesting characters and original visions of the world.  Though the story itself is derivative, and the special effects are no longer the greatest attraction these days (because of the flood of CGIs), 'Hellboy' still proves two things: 1) You don't need big budget to make a good film.  2) and so-called 'Stars' neither.  Nick Cage as Hellboy? Who said that?<br /><br />Anyway, the film based on Dark Horse comic book hero starts with a not-so-surprising scene in which the Nati soldiers (not again, please...) opens the portal that leads to the dark side of the world, in short, the Hell.  Their plans are disturned by the Allied troops and one Professor, but before the portal is destroyed completely, one boy comes into this side of the world -- 'Hellboy.'<br /><br />Cue to the present-day.  Now Hellboy is a hired (or kept) member of special task force in the secret department of the US government, and is fighting against the evil.  This time, however, the enemy is a bit strange, for the monster is attacking the old musuem.  The dark force that once tried to unleash the power of the Hell again stand before the hero, and his sidekick 'Abe' Sapien, who can read the past by touching.<br /><br />But the greatest part of the film is not the story, which is nothing new; it is the personality of Hellboy, who smokes cigars constantly, and speaks with a good amount of sarcasm, like a veteran cop in film noir.  And he could be also very sentimantal at times for he is in love with a lady Liz, who unwittingly emits fire all around her when enraged.<br /><br />Director Guillermo Del Toro insisted that Ron Perlman play the lead, and his choice turned out 100% right.  Perlman literally becomes the hero (with a great help from the make-up artists) and he clearly enjoys it.  So does Selma Blair as Liz, whose career so far is far from a usual one (did you see her in 'The Sweetest Thing'?)  And most of all, Del Toro knows what he is doing, and what is needed to make a good comic book hero, to whom we must relate as a credible character.  Hellboy is.<br /><br />With occasional dry humor -- see how Hellboy talks with a kid about his love, spying on Liz -- and effectively used special effects, 'Hellboy' is a film not only for comic book fans, but for general film fans.

0380977788|5.0|What a strange and disturbing little book! At a time when many children's authors are jumping on the fantasy bandwagon and producing clones of existing popular books, this weird tale comes as a refreshing change.  <br /> <br />The story is a surreal one; imagine 'Alice through the Looking Glass' with a contemporary twist, written in a style that makes the dark humor of Roald Dahl seem tame by comparison. Coraline lives with her parents in one half of a block of flats; the other half is empty and the door connecting the two is bricked up. However, one day the bricks vanish and Coraline finds her way into a parallel world that mirrors her own, but with some very, VERY disturbing differences. <br /> <br />Some reviewers have grumbled about lack of depth to supporting characters - but I think they are missing the point. This book is quite short, (largish print) and no time is wasted on superfluous details about Coraline's neighbours. The emphasis of their characterization is on dark humor - all we really need to know are their peculiarities and foibles to appreciate their skewed mirror characters in the alternate world Coraline gets herself trapped in.  <br /> <br />I like children's books to take me somewhere new, unique and different - and to give me a few laughs along the way. This book certainly gets into my top ten favourites, despite being like one of those hideous nightmares that you can't seem to wake up from! <br /> <br />If you enjoy something dark and different, check out 'Speed of the Dark,' by Alex Shearer. <br />
B0001DI0FI|5.0|First, I must say I'm a fan of O'Brian's books, which have been ported to screen by Peter Weir. As such, I was both longing and dreading this movie. So often, a good book is completely denatured by the necessary shortcomings of the movie-making art, and the brute need of explosions, fast action, predictable teenager-oriented scenarios of Hollywood productions. There was so much room for all that in the books... <br />  But Peter Weir made an excellent job. Of course he had to simplify  the plot (the main change is that nothing is said about Dr Mathurin's activity as a spy. Also, the enemy ship nationality was changed from US to French for the sake of Yankee's patriotic feelings) to make it fit into a 2-hour movie, but he did that cleverly and keeping the same balance that make the books so enjoyable. In the books, the focus is on the interplay between the characters, and mainly between the Captain Jack Aubrey and the Royal Navy surgeon Stephen Mathurin. They are also a realistic, accurate narrative of the life on board on Napoleonic-era ships, the political situation, etc.. The action, even the plot is secondary. Often, O'Brian puts more light on the preparations of a battle than on the battle itself. All this is true in the movie as well. The same balance, the same care to the historic details. And the soundtrack is perfectly adapted to this ambiance. <br />  When the film was still in the movie theatres, I saw it three times. I bought the double DVD as soon as it was available. Since then, I've invited friends to see it and it always get a good success, even with people who don't know the books, aren't interested in this period or in ships. <br />  On the double DVD are several scenes which had been cut from the final movie. I liked them very much as they introduce more characters, more interactions and more life-on-board scenes. <br />  This is really a masterpiece. This is an action movie that fulfils then need for subtleties and 2nd-degree humour of a matureaudience. A capital movie, and I give Peter Weir joy of it! <br />

B000084T18|1.0|Whenever I hear someone praise $.50 (or any other of these corporate gangsta hipity-hoppers), the compliments are shallow and fail to inform anyone about anything.  They will tell you that you need to listen to $.50 because \\"he was a real life drug dealer\\", \\"he is so good-looking and has a great bod\\", \\"he was shot nine times\\", and my favorite \\"him and eminem hang together\\".  I ask these people, \\"does he have any musical ability other that mumbling (since I won't dignify his guttural speech slurs as rapping) about b-word, n-word , bling, and drugs?\\"  I have yet to find a halfway decent response.<br /><br />I'll admit that I was never a big rap fan, but there was time I respected it as a valid art form.  There were the legends like Run-DMC and LL Cool J.  There were the politically active rappers like Public Enemy and KRS-One.  There were the great innovators like De La Soul and A Tribe Called Qwest.  There were fun pop rappers like Tone-loc and Young MC.  And then there was the comic relief of Biz Markee.  But right around 1993, my respect was staring to thin when I saw that the only  rappers that were receiving attention were the gangsta thugs.  No thanks to people like Suge Knight, the Saddam Hussein of the music business.  Ever since then, rap music has been engaged in a race toward last place.<br /><br />$.50 and his ilk represent the first eaten in the rap food chain when you only take talent into consideration.  But sadly, I can't blame just $.50 for his success.  People buy what Clear Channel, eMpTyV, and Rolling Stone tell them to buy rather than asking themselves one simple question : \\"Does this sound good to me?\\"  If all of $.50's fans can look deep inside themselves and say \\"yes, it does sound good\\", then the used CD stores of the world would be flooded with his CDs.<br /><br />Somewhere, $.50, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dog, Eminem, Ludacris, Jay-Z and Ja Rule are sitting in a strip club and laughing at all the schmucks who bought into the whole corporate gangsta deceit.  40 thousand gifted musicians out of work, and they are trying to be funny.ta deceit.  40 thousand gifted musicians out of work, and they are trying to be funny.
B00009UW0N|5.0|I didn't see this film until I bought this anniversary edition DVD and I have to say that this is one of my favorite horror movies. It didn't leave me feeling scared at all which is a feeling I like to get when watching slasher movies. Overall, an excellent movie. It is really too bad I wasn't alive when it came out because I would have definately seen it in the theatres.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I really do love this album. I like how they took it into a new direction from their last. This cd is a little more melodic and sounds fantastic. Ok, enough of the gloating about the cd. I will just end the gloating by saying that if you loved the first cd, you will love this cd.  <br /> <br />songs which really stand out on the cd: <br /> <br />WEAK AND POWERLESS - the first single from the cd and a really good song. it's has a really nice slow guitar intro which slowly fades in and gets going from there.  <br />BLUE - two words: Awesome Song! This song has a really catchy chorus that you can't help but sing. The lyrics are very meaningful and full of raw emotion.  <br />THE OUTSIDER - not too many people seem to like this song for some reason. I actualy didn't like it at first, but after I heard it a few times, It started to grow on me.  <br />THE NURSE WHO LOVED ME - an interesting song, but still a very good one that you can listen to.  <br />THE NOOSE - Good song. A very relaxing track. Maynard's lyrics really shine with this song. The bands music couldn't be any more perfect on this song. If you are feeling down about something, or are just trying to relax, this song will really help.  <br />VANISHING - this song starts out kind of weird, but then gets into some good riffs from Billy.  <br /> <br />I recommend this cd to anyone who loved A Perfect Circle's first cd.  <br />
B00005NGAL|5.0|I absolutely loved this DVD... The cast is just about perfect (although, no offense meant, Ken Page is perhaps past his prime)... Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer was great- a far cry from the number on the original Broadway cast recording where it is a solo for Munkustrap (and a not very good Munkustrap at that!) Jacob Brent is absolutely PERFECT as Mr. Mistoffelees, as is Jon Partridge in the role of the Rum Tum Tugger.  Elaine Paige is great reprising her role as Grizabella and John Mills is a wonderful Gus the Theatre Cat.  I really fell in love with this DVD- as I've said, the cast is about as close to perfect as you can get, and the music is GREAT, which makes up for the fairly weak storyline.  (And as for repetitive choreography as mentioned in one of the reviews... when have you ever seen a show that never repeats a single dance move... I mean, honestly!)
B00005R24G|5.0|Sleuth is a difficult film to review without hindering the pleasure it offers the newcomer, since watching the film's twists and reversals reveal themselves is a big part of the fun.  Lawrence Olivier is mystery author Andrew Wyke, a cuckold who invites his wife's lover, Michael Caine's Milo Tindle, to hear a proposal.  Wyke keeps up appearances as a blase Englishman who's just relieved to be rid of his profligate wife, and wishes to help the more earthy Tindle to support her financially, though a staged burglary of his insured jewels.  Yet there is more to Wyke's scheme, we soon see, just as there is more to his attitude toward Tindle, the son of an immigrant watchmaker who would dare step out of his place to take the wife of a well-placed Englishman.<br /><br />Olivier and Caine are both fantastic in this film, and their performances alone make the film come alive.  But the fantastic script is just as compelling.  Sparklingly witty and droll dialogue with a sinister undertone building as the plot twists just keep coming, impeccably paced all contribute to a film that is a thrill to watch the first time, in a state of ignorance, and almost as fun to watch when you know what's coming, admiring just how masterfully it all unfolds.
0385659806|4.0|I was appaulled to hear that advocacy groups for Autism were condemning this book - the first thing you pick up when dealing with Autism or Aspergers is that no two individuals are alike.  Some of them have behaviours that are completely opposite.  Is this book an accurate portrayal of this affliction, I don't know, I'm not autistic.  What I can say however, is that in my years of working with autistic children, this is the sort of impression I received from them.  Keep in mind that this book is fiction and not a thesis - and as a work of fiction it is absolutely spectacular.  As my title infers, I cried three times and I'm not much for crying.  Give the book a read and let the activists go hoarse with their condemning chants.
B00009W0U4|5.0|I can only say that this movie affected me more than any other movie in a very long time, if ever.  From the beginning I knew I was in for something different.  The first scene with dialogue is amazing, riveting, the bleakness, the starkness.  I rewound that alone ten times.  From there I was ripped from the comforts of my bed and life into the reality of Gaspar Noe.  Within ten more minutes I had to pause and gather my composure.  The realism, the brutality, the language, the cinematography, like a merry go round from hell.  Noe's vision is presented in reverse as the questions are answered scene to scene.  Requires multiple viewings to fully understand.  There have been sufficient other reviews here so I will end with this is a fabulous and must see film.  Not for the weak though, very explicit and disturbing.  Believe me...
B000062X90|4.0|This reminds me just how good their duelling-guitar boogie sound was. Argus (REMASTERED) is among the top 3 best W.A. albums. W.A. had one of the more unique guitar & vocal harmonies & styles, from the 70's. Influential band, but never achieved huge fame. Very enjoyable guitar, rhythm, vocals.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|While \\"Ray\\" didn't include any of the duets he performed, it was after all nearly three hours long...you can just listen to this album instead.<br /><br />What range Ray had as a singer and it shows in his choice of musical partners, from Willie Nelson to Norah Jones (lovely to see that our young performers have musical idols and Ray is at the top of the list, personally and professionally).  Willie would understand Ray's struggle with drugs, Norah his desire to innovate.  And for Johnny Mathis to feel \\"humbled\\" being in the same recording studio with Ray is saying something.<br /><br />The duet with Elton John is marvelous, although it's a fierce contest between them to decide who has the cooler shades!<br /><br />In the movie, people criticized Ray for channelling Nat King Cole at the expense of its own voice.  How interesting that Nat's daughter Natalie characterizes Ray as the flip-side of her father.  I love the album liner notes.<br /><br />Bonnie Raitt is one of the stars in the upcoming \\"Lightning in a Bottle,\\" the one-night film history of R&B, and she proves why when she croons \\"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind\\" with Ray.<br /><br />Speaking of crossing, Ray proved long ago that, like Sinatra and Elvis, he had crossover appeal.
B000002KB8|5.0|It's funny how you actually think that Avril person is serious... I knew she was a joke the first time I read one of her reviews(I think it was the Evanescence one).  I mean, come on!  She said BEETHOVEN was a poser, f***in Beethoven!  Just read her reviews... She praises the crappy no-talent people and bashes our good bands.  I guess she's just one of those people who don't have anything better to do with her spare time except piss people off. :)  As for the album, I don't actually have it but it's Black Sabbath so it's bound to be good.
B000002BHE|5.0|Every popular A-rated diva will always have one particular album where they did no wrong. it's that one album once you've achieved it, no matter what you do you can never repeat it again. thats what i think anyway. mariah had daydream, toni had secrets, whitney had bodyguard. celine dion had falling into you. although let's talk about love was good but i can never live up to the hype & genius of this album. <br /> <br />i don't know what make this album so good, most probably the diversity and honesty that was imbedded during the making of this album. if you were to ask me to list my favourite albums of all time, this would be up there with the such of santana's supernatural, mariah carey's daydream, george micheal's older, alanis morisseete's jagged little pill & blur's 13.  <br /> <br />in here lies the greatest love songs ever written.  <br />IT'S ALL COMING BACK TO ME NOW - is probably on top of the list. its penned by jim steinman and to me will always be then most beautiful song to me. ever. the lyrics is beautiful, the melody captivating & celine sealed the deal. <br />then there's TO LOVE YOU MORE that features taro hakase on violin, that fuses a very ethnical melody with western influence to create magic. <br />FLY a song dedicated to her niece karine, is pure and sweet, which it's strength lies in its poetically constructed words. <br />I LOVE YOU is the 1st song i ever liked from celine. it's nice and there's nothing more sweeter than an urequitted love that you thought wrong. <br />DREAMING OF YOU - MASTERPIECE <br /> <br />The next are great songs (remember above are the greatest love songs ever whereas, this is just the beginning of the great song in this album) <br />BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME which is penned by the great soundtrack queen dianne warren. it sfor the soundtrack of up, close & personal. it has been the lead single for this album. nice <br />FALLING INTO YOU is the title track. the beauty lies in the exotic musical arrangement & the simplicityin it's words. of course celine's voice is self-explainatory. <br />SEDUCES ME - breathlessly sensual singing style accompanied with a heartachingly beautiful tune. <br />ALL BY MYSELF is a cover of eric carmen's hit & is the living proof of celine's vocal capability. when you listen to this song you could actually feel the greatest pain ever - loneliness. <br />CALL THE MAN - just like it for no special reason <br /> <br />just when u thought that she can't pull something upbeat, well she proved you wrong again <br />i'm absolutely in love with DECLARATION OF LOVE, me thinks it's just a great track. period. <br />MAKE YOU HAPPY actually achieved whwt it sought to do. to make me happy, heck it was once used for a children's cartoon commercial. tell me how happier can you get. <br /> <br />I DON'T KNOW (darkly lingerince of not knowing how to live witout someone's affection)& RIVER DEEP, MOUNTAIN HIGH (nothing can stop you if you want it bad enough courtesy of tina turner) are nice.  <br /> <br />NATURAL WOMAN (originally performed by aretha franklin) & IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES, are okay tracks though it doesn't match up to the phenomenon of the other 14 tracks. <br /> <br />YOUR LIGHT is not available in the asian version of this cd. <br /> <br />you want a verdict. it is one of the best album of all times. it even nailed best pop album & album of the year at the 1997 grammy's. sold more than 20 millions all over the world. need more convincing. didn't think so.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Personally, I loved this movie. It was as accurate as any movie is going to get. I can't wait for the DVD to come out.  <br /> <br />On a side note: 3 hot guys in skirts, fighting each other,.... if that's not reason enough to get the movie - then I don't know what to tell you.
B00006CXXU|4.0|maybe writing this is a bit too late, but i guess that's cos i was never motivated to write reviews until today. why? i read a review before this about how this album helped this guy get thru a really bad time. then it hit me. if i really loved this album, why not express myself to compliment on how talented ms aguilera is and what the album means to me. <br /> <br />1stly let me just enlighten something that has been proven as a fact - christina can sing. sure britney can dance, mandy is sweet & a credible actress and jessica can sing but in a very,very messy way. christina on the other hand is really smart, can really sing and can really perform. yes there was a time,she was straining her chords and some people might review it as shrieking. but give the gal a break. when she started in this industry, she's a teenager in an ocean of talents, that just wanna stand out. now she's all grown up and bloomed into a talented, beautiful & professional star. <br /> <br />some might comment on her appearence, but to think of it, why are we so concerned? she's young and is trying to find an image for herself. if anyone is to blame its those people who've been comparing her to her other peers. all i think she's doing now is to seperate herself from the same prototype that has haunted her all the while. let her grow, let her make mistakes & let her learm from them. <br /> <br />that is what this album really is about. if about believing in yourself, reach for the stars and having some fun on  the way. <br /> <br />my favourite songs in this album which are truly gems are: <br />BEAUTIFUL, a gentle plod of the piano arranged with some strings and just let christina do the rest. not only is her voice wonderful, the song is filled with honesty and grace, telling us to appreciate the most important human trait-inner beauty. <br />IMPOSSIBLE, a collaboration with alicia keys is a refreshing soulfull ballad that is just a masterfull. <br />if you think that the love and advice stopsthere, then you're mistaken, there's THE VOICE WITHIN-an touching orchestrated ballad with choir, another tune that preaches on faith in oneself. <br />enough with all the sweet stuff, then comes FIGHTER, probably one of the best pop song ever made, guests dave navarro, that surely packs a wallop on how you should stand & fight for your right. <br />DIRRTY & GET MINE,GET YOURS are cool r&b party anthemns that reminds you to enjoy your youth & party once in awhile. <br />then u can get a lil bit of latino heat where she fights temptation & get all orgasmic over her puppy love on INFATUATION.            <br /> <br />other great tracks are: <br />CAN'T HOLD US DOWN, an r&b flavoured track with lil kim, that shoots back on certain individuals in a not so disguised manner. <br />WALKING AWAY-a smouldering ballad that you hear at a bar at 12 midnight which to me, is seriously cool. <br />I'M OK-a dark guitar striven song that she delivers full of emotion, hands-on experience for her about her abusive father. <br />CRUZ & SOAR - great songs that shows away her soulfull side <br />MAKE OVER, her first tackle on something more rockier & edgier, though isn't prfect but a very nice commendable effort. <br /> <br />the such of LOVING ME 4 ME-a very different neo urban tune and UNDERAPPRECIATED-a street soul r&b about a relatioship that has lost its magic, is actually quite okay. averagely good & definitely not fillers.    <br /> <br />amongst all, christina, to my opinion, did slip a little on KEEP ON SINGIN' MY SONG, which i thought is relly best left out of the list and opted for maybe, MISS INDEPENDENT-the song that she co-wrote & was passed to kelly clarkson. it's okay though since she's human after all.    <br /> <br />13 gems, 2 average, 1 odd disaster - all in all i think it a superb, phenomenal pop album that, though is kinda late, you gotta have. i've been listening to it ever since it came out (i even lost my 1st one & my friend bought another one for my birthday) thru both happy & not-so-happy moments. it even managed to lift me up & cheer me. if it can do that to a person then its truly a MASTERPIECE <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|Say what you like about Michael Moore, this is a must see collection of shocking clips that expose the bias of the elitist right, the true brutal front of the war on terrorism, and the effects on regular people from his hometown of Flint Michigan.   <br /> <br /> Moore has collected and compiled some amazing footage that is narrated with his famous sacastic wit and accusatory bias.

630516889X|5.0|Two real-life governors -- Arnold Schwarzenegger (Dutch) and Jesse Ventura (Sgt. Blain) -- use their muscled intellects to pursue a force more sinister than state budget crises. It's an otherworldly creature deep in the jungle adept at slaughtering our best-trained fighters, and worse yet, it's practically invisible. Special effects, dizzying camera work and a sci-fi bent elevate this gory horror-actioner, making the 1990 sequel a given.
B0002F1CO6|5.0|This is going to be a two-part review because I just don't think it would be right to review 135 minutes of music with tons of singers and musicians in a single review. The main reason, however, is because I can't decide if this deserves a 5 or 4-star rating as I love The Dream Sequencer way too much to rate it so poorly.<br /><br />The Dream Sequencer was originally released in 2000 by Transmission Records as a single CD release but in the back of the CD it was clearly mentioned that it was the first part of a double album. This is Arjen's song-oriented and melodic approach to an atmospheric journey through time and space. I'll be honest; over the 4 years I've owned this disc, I've never paid much attention to the concept but the thing still struck me as deeply moving and emotional on a lyrical aspect.<br /><br />I like this disc better than Flight of the Migrator because it features some of the 'most fitting' singers Arjen has ever worked with. It was a good insight on what singers like Johan Edlund and Neal Morse are capable of if they partake in such projects. Unlike the other Ayreon releases, each song on the Universal Migrator records features a single singer except for occasional back-ups and it's this what makes The Dream Sequencer so beautiful. After the heavily atmospheric intro layered with depths of emotion on the title track, we're introduced to \\"My House on Mars\\" sung by Johan Edlund of Tiamat fame. Edlund's vocal delivery is one of the finest on the entire disc; he possesses a low, melancholic voice similar to Dan Swano's singing on the Star One project. Also, both Arjen and Edlund being big Pink Floyd fans, their collaboration in the songwriting is perfect. While Edlund wrote his own vocal melodies, Arjen came up with the lyrics. Floor Jansen's back-up vocals in this track complement everything beautifully. Another great track is \\"One Small Step\\" delivered by Edward Reekers. Reekers is a long-time Ayreon 'member' and he sings in a warm voice over symphonic arrangements. Somehow I feel Arjen further explored this type of vocal stylings on his new album The Human Equation. This track also has a slow yet incredibly profound guitar solo that builds up delicately in a nice Pink Floyd style.<br /><br />Lana Lana and another Ayreon veteran Damian Wilson are the two singers who appear on both Migrator albums. Wilson sings on \\"And the Druids Turned to Stone\\" which begins with a very cold, almost creepy intro but is turned into a heartfelt tune thanks to Damian Wilson's indestructable vocals. There is another magnificent guitar solo here; the bluesy melody is played over acoustic guitars and once again the Floydan keyboards give it a very moving vibe. I have to give kudos to both keyboardists on this disc, Erik Norlander and Clive Nolan. They are living proof that you can capture a totally unique style without having to be flashy. On this album the guitar work isn't very dominant; it's sparsely used because the songs are more centred around atmospheric keyboard and synth-driven melodies.<br /><br />Most of the songs are within the 7 or 8-minute mark but there are also more compact tunes, one of which is delivered by Arjen Lucassen himself (\\"Carried by the Wind\\"). The other short-song \\"Temple of the Cat\\" is performed by female vocalist Jacqueline Govaert. The Neal Morse-sung \\"The First Man on Earth\\" has a very happy-go intro and Beatles-like back-ups by Mark McCrite. Morse is not a very technical singer but his work with the amazing prog band Spock's Beard clearly shows that he has tremendous expression in his singing. He doesn't disappoint in Ayreon either and the guitar solo that follows is simply fantastic.<br /><br />The Dream Sequencer is easily one of my top 5 Arjen Lucassen albums. I remember I didn't care for it much when I first got it, but with each passing year, it's grown on me and now I consider it a very unique offering in Ayreon's ever-growing back catalog. I believe you'll discover the deepness and richness of The Dream Sequencer only if you keep listening to it patiently. 70 minutes of prog masterpiece. Period.ss and richness of The Dream Sequencer only if you keep listening to it patiently. 70 minutes of prog masterpiece. Period.

B00005JMH2|4.0|It was difficult, indeed, because Gere has a certain magnetism, both on and off screen, that transcends just his looks and certainly overwhelms his acting, which can be a bit stiff at times.  In this movie, Gere is perfection.  Of course, we make the comparison to his best role, in \\"Chicago\\", and we don't find him wanting here.  As an ordinary man, in an unremarkable field of law (he writes wills for his clients), he has a daughter he loves, and a beautiful and accomplished wife (like many, too busy with mothering and career to see what he might be missing) in the incomparable Susan Sarandon.<br /><br />Here she is just more than a bit player, but her appeal and her counterpoint to Gere is well cast.  Gere is downcast because something is missing in his life, something that will help restore the joy.  A subplot involves Sarandon hiring a detective to find out what her husband has been up to, and she has her best scenes as a sexy counterpoint to detective Devine (Richard Jenkins) that are reminiscent of her old role in the delightful \\"Compromising Positions\\"....Jenkin's assistant, Scottie, is a walking encyclopedia of literature and facts, and is ably played by Nick Cannon, who we saw last year in \\"Drumline\\"<br /><br />It could have been anything that changed his life, but Gere chooses ballroom dancing.  The draw is the beautiful and mysterious face he sees in the window of \\"Miss Mitzi's Dancing School\\".  In that face, in that manner, the melancholy Paulina (Jennifer Lopez surprises with her elegant detachment), draws him because in her, he sees himself - certainly he is attracted by her beauty, but it is clear from the beginning that there is little in the way of romance between them; just two souls that are overwhelmed by sadness, trying to recapture some of the joy in their lives by dancing.<br /><br />Miss Mitzi's is a shabby little school where Gere finds himself in a beginners' class with Bobby Cannavale (Third Watch, Oz, The Station Agent) who shows some comic chops, and the loveable Omar Benson Miller (8 Mile, Sorority Boys) who is hard not to like as a clumsy giant.  Both Chick and Vern blossom under the tutelage of Miss Mitzi (Anita Gillette), who is not above a little nip of gin from her flask from time to time as she tries to cope with her \\"dancers\\".  The bonding of the people in the class is the most understated message in the movie - sometimes you continue to do things because you have found a camaraderie with others who are unlikely friends.<br /><br />Add some over the top comedy from one of my favorite actors, the marvelous Stanley Tucci (with a wig that needed to meet an untimely death) and Lisa Ann Walter (she's one of those actresses that always is cast comedically, and you swear you've seen her a hundred times; in reality, her best roles were rather minor, in \\"The Parent Trap\\", as the maid, and in \\"Bruce Almighty\\" as Jennifer Aniston's buddy) - both of them are passionate about the dance, and Tucci, as Link Peterson, from Gere's law firm, is trying to hide his passion in plain sight.<br /><br />Timing is everything, and Director Peter Chelsom, a Brit with little exposure in this country, succeeds in building up to the dance competition, with the inevitable crash and burn scene, followed by a heart-warming conclusion where we learn that Gere has not wasted his efforts, and has truly made a difference in his life with his unusual choice of hobby.<br /><br />The soundtrack for \\"Shall We Dance?\\" is a delicious mix of new and old, and I was taken by Mya's rendition of David Bowie's old chestnut \\"Let's Dance\\".  High time that was remade, and a highlight of an eclectic musical background that aids the film but doesn't overwhelm the script.  The choreography is stunning, both in the school and at the competition.<br /><br />Give La Lopez credit for her ability to dance; whether she is dancing to Latin rhythms, completing a perfect waltz, or, in my favorite scene - teaching Gere to really feel the music in a perfectpairing that is all romance and virtually no sexual tension. Lopez is beautiful.  Her costumes are perfect for her, and there is an amazing little black dress in the scene where she loses her cool and lectures Gere on what the emotions of the rhumba really are - she's gorgeous in this incarnation.  Funny, in some ways she has a catalyst role, and doesn't really get involved in the humor, which is subtle and makes you smile, rather than trying to be hysterically funny, which she could never pull off.<br /><br />I loved my night with \\"Shall We Dance?\\".  I'll definitely buy the DVD for more viewings!  I didn't see the Japanese original, nor did I try to compare it to other dance movies and find it wanting.  I just purely enjoyed the storyline, the filming and the romance.  You will too.lly feel the music in a perfect pairing that is all romance and virtually no sexual tension. Lopez is beautiful.

B000286S8S|2.0|I like Van Halen as much as the next person,and i really enjoyed this album.My question is why?Do we honestly need another compilation of this stuff?These guys are 50+ and reuniting,can't anyone except the fact that the 80's are gone and these bands should just gracefully bow out,instead of making so much profit off albums that they don't need.Bands like as Aerosmith,Rolling Bones,and even Metallican't should just pack up,enjoy there money,and stop trying to reinvent there youth.I'm not even curious as to hear what a NEW van halen CD will sound like.Gee mabye slow,dryed up,and trying to sound popular.Well i'm sorry but these bands had there Hay Day and i like to listen back to it,but come on old 80's bands do us all a favor and QUIT reuniting,because with the exception of Black Sabbath(reason being they are still cool,and attempted to write new material together,realized it was no good,so now they just do old classicas on OZZfest).Just take a listen to new albums from Europe,Megadeth,Tesla,even to my Dismay the mighty DIO has fallen.etc.listen and you'll see what i mean.Dead.

Great work, still after all these years I keep this band as one of my favorites....

B0000VAFO0|4.0|I wouldn't call it a \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" flick, mainly because the story focuses very little on any romance between Michael and Selene (Scott and Kate), and keeps the attention firmly placed on the constant battle between lycan and vampire.<br /><br />Not that I'm complaining - the plot was strong, the special effects were killer, the plot twists were awesome, and Kate (in my opinion) breaks away from the fresh and clean persona to play a Lara Croft-esque, kick-butt character.<br /><br />My only complaint is the annoyingly blue contacts (really, is that necessary?  If you're going for spooky eyes, make them glow or something, don't just slap on fake contact lenses), and the fact that it was touted as a Romeo-and-Juliet flick by so many critics, and wasn't.  I didn't mind that there was a decided lack of romance, but I wish they would have just said that, instead of making it seem as such.  Additionally, I wanted to kill Kraven five minutes in.<br /><br />Overall, a definately good flick for vamp/werewolf lovers (with pretty darn good effects!  The scene with Michael in the back of the cop car was spectacular).  Go in with no expectations, and it'll undoubtedly be a hit.  Go in expecting superb acting and romantic chemistry between the hero and heroine, and look for another movie.  :D
B00005JMXX|3.0|Director/Co-writer Roland Emmerich brings to his audience another un-realistic, against-all-odds, action thriller similar to Independence Days' style and typical of Hollywood. This time we are treated to the effects of \\"Global Warming\\", which causes the antithesis of the common effect you would expect- the freezing of practically the entire northern hemisphere. We are told that this \\"Modern Ice Age\\" occurs do to the extreme temperature change in the North Atlantic current. The Film's lead actor Dennis Quaid fulfills his role as the \\"heroic father\\" set on rescuing his son from N.Y.C., which is suppose to be hit by the worst storm that will freeze anything in its path. Jake Gyllenhaal (Qauid's son) leaves the audience into boredom by his lack of acting and believability to the catastrophic situation. Although the film's specials effects are at top notch, there is no excuse to deny the common elements that make a true production: an engaging plot and true acting. However, I do believe that Emmerich does achieve his central message: man's sightlessness of his effect on the environment. We can try to avoid global warming all we want, but the fact is it does pose a problem for our future. Overall, if you want a joyride film full of dazzling effects that is predictable and devoid of good acting, then by all means watch The Day After Tomorrow. However, if you are looking for a movie that will make you think, carries professional, true actors then this film may bore or upset you.

0312263120|1.0|Although based on an intelligent premise, \\"Digital Fortress\\" is full of bad dialogue, unlikely plot twists and dodgy computer science. The finale is written in breathless style as the protagonists struggle to make sense of a vital clue in order to unlock the code and prevent total disaster. Most readers will have glanced at the clue and worked out the answer in a matter of seconds - but the cast of characters (encryption experts and code jockeys all) almost manage to get it wrong, apparently because they can't read a set of google search results..    Bah! Read it on a plane, had no choice. My real rating is NO stars, but the lowest you can give is one.
B0006213WG|5.0|I'm am actually glad I bought this in the end. I have been a fan of Sum 41 from 2001 and liked the punk/rock music a lot. I seemed to have moved into more heavier stuff since then and enjoyed it more such as Slipknot/System of a Down/Korn. I was a little worried that this would be the same as there 1 2nd or 3rd album(they released 4 albums not 3) and still be punk/rock but I like them more now because they did move to punk/metal. There still are some soft songs but I can handle them. There are 2 acoustic songs which are actually good. There are awesome solos in some songs. I wish they would have put solos in all the songs. Drumming is still cool and fast. I don't like how Stevo(drummer)took off the 32 in his nickname. Still this a great cd to buy and it's worth every penny.

B0001NBMBC|1.0|Corey does suck. He says this album is brutal. Far from it. Go listen to Disturbed or KoRn for Christ's sake. Down with the Sickness and Right Now could kick all these song's asses. Believe me that only two songs worth listening to on this cd is Virus of Life, and Vermillion. That is it. Which you can easily pirate with Kazaa.  <br /> <br />- Karasu
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknot gives metal music a whole new name. Their music kicks ass. This is their best CD they ever made. It has all the great hits too. Anybody who loves metal music should have this CD. Joey has sweet drum beats. Beware there is some bad lauguage.    1.742617000027 - 6/10  2.(sic) - 10/10  3.Eyeless - 10/10  4.Wait and Bleed - 10/10  5.Surfacing - 9/10  6.Spit It Out - 10/10  7.Tattered and Torn - 8/10  8.Me Inside - 9/10  9.Liberate - 9/10  10.Prosthetics - 9/10  11.No Life - 9/10  12.Diluted - 9/10  13.Only One - 9/10  14.Scissors - 10/10
B0000931OG|2.0|What a blur of pointless crap. This may be The most boring, pointless album i've ever heard. Cool? Greatness? oh,no, no, no... i don't think so. If anyone considers this Greatness i gotta ask what are you smokin buddy. NOt to bash anyone's favorite band, but this is a waste of time. I can only thank God that it isn't longer. This albums follows alot of what blur does, so it seems they just keep repeating past album.  Here's tha band's meeting before they begin an album: \\"Let's go in the studio, get some drugs, and become so strung out that the album sounds like we feel. Then when we feel good we'll make one punk song, and end the album's sessions.\\"<br /><br />Crap.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This CD has so many good songs on it. I think it is one of their best CDs. My favorite and most popular song is \\"American Idiot\\". If your a Green Day fan you should have this CD in your collection. Anybody who likes rock should like this CD. They play wery fast and hard compared to some of the others CDs they made in the past. There's not much language in this CD so I reconmmend it to EVERYBODY.
B000002IZ4|5.0|What a strong release from one of the most underrated bands of the 90's. Honestly if you love 90's rock, this is more than a must, but a necessity. Besides the fact that the music rocks your socks off, you have got to love the lyrics. I mean just fantastic lyrics, that fit perfectly like a finished puzzle. What's cool about this too is i don't think it says anywhere on the album that this album is even called purple. I guess maybe that chinese symbol means purple, i don't know, either way that's kind of cool. ANyways it's got great riffs, and awesome melodies to keep you rockin forever.
B00005JMX6|5.0|This is a great movie. The Girl Next Door is so Hottt! She's a former porn star which moves in next to a kid attracted to her as soon as she moves in. The movie goes alone as Cuthbert's character tries to impress the 10-year old porn star. He runs down the street next to her car with only an intertube around him. They skinny dip in his pool together. The rest I'm going to leave up to you to watch. All the way through it's a great movie. Anybody that doesn't like this just don't like comedies.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Why must you hear this album? Because you can't afford not too. IT is just that good. Especially at night. IF you really want to let it breathe, listen to it at night when its majestic awe can really shine forth. But if you can't it is still great. IF you've seen this album around, and have heard of its greatness, but are still wondering, then i'm hear to tell you don't wonder anymore. It's an album that will be talked about as a classic, in years to come. IT's pretty beautiful too, and it's quite a piece of work.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|Buy the two disc set, the one disc is devoid of any special effects sections and it's too bad, because there were some awesome effects employed.  As for the movie -- the synopsis provides the reader with a complete overview, skipping nothing. There have been some recent war movies which depict war as it is...ugly, unmerciless,a bloody hell. Doesn't one suppose that 17th century maritime ventures were rather grim? This movie doesn't reflect that. It's a romanticized version of life at sea. Life at sea in the 17th century meant LIFE at sea, impressed sailors, brutal conditions, foul bilges and water... none of which are really brought out or depicted. The battle scenes were good, lot's of splintered wood flying about and some blood, Speilburg is more graphic.  I thoroughly enjoyed the taking off into deepwater for a while. The movie shows itself to be a pretty acurate rendition of the book. The ending was neat... leaving the viewer with a thirst for the next chapter. Why a 4, for the craftsmanship that went into the making of the piece. Again, pick up the 2 disc set.
B000174LVQ|3.0|This refers to my previous review and reveiws of some other fans:  I think everyone knows that flamenco is not only guitar playing! but paco is famous because of his brilliant style of playing flamenco guitar...I think he got what he wanted so hes back to the traditional style now and if he continues like this i would say that its time for him to retire!     one more thing i have to add is that if paco previous albums were all similar styles to this one! he would have never been recognised internationaly! just see above the number of used cd's of this album for sale!!its more than 70!! fans are disapointed!       Old reveiw:  Paco is best when he is playing alone(without singers)..he is a 10 star as a guitar player infact he is the best of them all, but this album is nothing compared to the previous one's, but as a paco fan still u should have it.the thing i didnt like was  the singers! the good thing was the rumba..the music quality is very good...come on paco give us the old styles..
B000002TYX|5.0|Beatles fans got a very nice treat in late 1995. That was the first king-size collection of some of the Beatles' previously unreleased recordings,alternate versions and some goofs. We begin with FREE AS A BIRD which is not completely new. It began with the late John Lennon recording the song in 1977 and eighteen years later,added instrumentation with Paul McCartney,Ringo Starr and the late George Harrison(Harrison died in 2001). So the first Beatles recording in 25 years was born. Lennon's widow Yoko Ono gave Lennon's recording of FAAB to Paul,George and Ringo. This album features interview excerpts,given by Lennon,McCartney and the Beatles' late manager Brian Epstein. Some tracks were recorded as early as 1960. Some of them were monaural tape recordings. Some tracks were even recorded live.
B000004727|5.0|Paco De lucia is the best guitarest ever in his generation and this album is excellent..u will like it more each time u listen to it...all titles are very good but Gloria Al Nino Ricardo is a ten star rating, one of the best Solea played by Paco de Lucia...infact this album is one of the best albums of Paco...
B000068FY0|5.0|I was born a good solid decade after this was released. I first heard of Supertramp from a free compilation from Virgin Megastores, and it remains one of my best discoveries yet. The deceptively soothing piano that lulls the unsuspecting listener into an orgy of intelligent, crashing rock at its best took me by complete surprise, as did the sheer brilliance of the writing. This is not your average off-the-shelf rock album, but a journey into an insane world of art, put together - nay, composed, by the sadly underrated and ignored geniuses that call themselves Supertramp. Judge this not by the samples. You must hear the entire album in all its glory to fully appreciate this legendary masterpiece.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I have had this album since it's release date, way before many people even knew who John Mayer was.  I have listened to my copy so much that I have almost worn the cd out.  I would highly recommend this cd to anyone who loves great music, from artists who actually sing onstage.  This is one of my favorite albums and John Mayer is one of the best, if not the best, concert I have ever been too.  Just check this cd out, it is amazing!
6305603847|3.0|I first saw this in the theaters,saw it on video a couple of times, and recently picked up the DVD to see how I like it now. I also watched some of Alan Parker's films recently and wanted to see how this one stacked up against the others he's done since..  <br /> <br />Alan Parker directed this film. I loved \\"Angela's Ashes\\", and as far as musical films go, he did it the best with \\"The Committments\\", also another favorite. \\"Midnight Express\\", \\"Shoot The Moon\\" and \\"Fame\\" are part of his credentials, all great films. This film I would put with Madonna's version of \\"Evita\\", or \\"Angel Heart\\", where you'll either love it or hate it. You could even make links to \\"Birdy\\" with \\"The Wall\\" in a way, as it deals with the effects of war, one from the view of a child, the other the view of a vet.  <br /> <br />This film is notorious for watching it *ahem* \\"chemically enhanced\\", but I think that between the imagery and sound and \\"storyline\\", it'll disorient you anyway.    <br /> <br />To sum it up, a British rock star has a breakdown and regresses into his childhood of cruel mothers, cheating wives and sadistic teachers, a growing detachment of the world he lives in as well as megalomania that a rock star has, which is shown as   potentially dangerous thing to have.  \\"Pink\\" (Sir Bob Geldof of Boomtown Rats and Live Aid fame) is a composite of Roger Waters, Syd Barrett as well as those who grew up in England post WWII.  A lot of cultural references are mentioned that might go over American's heads, but not too much. The actors are mostly British, except for the groupies, one of which is Jenny Wright from \\"Near Dark\\".  <br /> <br />The animation by Gerald Scarfe is still great to watch.  <br /> <br />Watch out for Joanne Whalley-Kilmer and Nell from \\"Rocky Horror\\" as the groupies, and Roger Waters in the wedding scene. Bob Hoskins is Pink's manager, unfortunatly not in it long enough. As far as Bob Geldof's performance goes, I liked it, but not sure if I felt much sympathy towardshim.    <br /> <br />As far as the extras go, you have commentary by Roger which does fill in some blanks but not much, but it does explain that Parker and Waters had a falling out early on (no surprise). You have a \\"making of\\" that shows the genesis of the film and some rare live Pink Floyd footage from 1980 that make it worth watching, and the original \\"Another Brick in the Wall II\\" promo video.  <br /> <br />If you like Pink Floyd and \\"The Wall\\" in particular, it's an essential film. I think for those who have never seen it before, it'll be an unsettling film. But it sounds great, and the film looks great. If you're a Parker fan, you might think it's one of his lesser films. As far as musicals go, it's miles above \\"Tommy\\" and \\"Sgt Pepper\\", and more on the same level as \\"Quadrophenia\\", and less insane than \\"Lisztomania\\". It's  a \\"must have\\" as a cult classic.  <br /> <br />I wouldn't be surprised if Roger decides to remake it one of these days though, esp. having mixed feelings about the film and with the news that Waters wants to take it to Broadway and do it as a stage musical. Supposedly they're also planning on making improvements on the live footage from 1980.
B000002U8G|5.0|I first heard Meddle at a pals home in 1973. Up to that point I thought that Bowie was the ultimate visionary. The album belonged to my friend's older brother and we listened to One of these days on his dads HiFi. It was a real seperates system with Leak components and huge Wharfedale floorstanders. I was blown away. I bought the album the next day. Meddle is a great Floyd album and deserves to be considered as one of their finest optimistic works along with Wish You Were Here and Dark Side. I am not a religious person but listening to Echos in the dark is close to a spiritual experience for me. Check out an old Art House Movie called Silver Surfer, where Echoes plays in full as the backdrop to some awsome wave riding. Also check out the live version on the Live at Pompei Directors cut DVD, although they spoil the flow by splitting the track between the start and the end of the film. Echoes is one of two tracks that I want to be played at my funeral, along with Led Zep's Thank You, as a tribute to my lady who has always been there to put the fuel in my tank and give me the lift to soar like an eagle.
B000001ESP|5.0|The biggest flaw out of this one is that there's only 7 songs.   <br /> <br />However, if you start with A Farewell To Kings, continue through Hemispheres, through Permanent Waves, into Moving Pictures, and land at Signals (although that one's also the more \\"synth-heavy\\" era of their next phase through the 80s through Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows, and Hold Your Fire), it's an impressive body of work with just those albums. \\"Exit Stage Left\\" is the live document from that era sans \\"Signals\\". So if you get \\"Moving Pictures\\", pick up the others that go along with it as well, it'll whet your appetite.  <br /> <br />Rush came into their own during this era and developed their own sound apart from Led Zeppelin. \\"Tom Sawyer\\" has been a classic rock staple since it came out as has \\"Limelight\\", an ode to life on the road. \\"YYZ\\" is an instrumental played at just about every Rush show since, showcasing Neil's drum playing. There's no weak link in the bunch, esp. since it is so short, there are no \\"filler\\" songs. It's well-written (not your typical \\"dumb rock\\" album), the musicianship is solid (it's Rush!, why wouldn't it be?), and it's a point of reference every musician needs to listen to...    <br /> <br />There's a new generation of music lovers who are just beginning to discover what is now \\"classic rock\\". This should be one near the top of your list.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|THIS MOVIE CASTS TOM CRUISE IN THE VILLAIN ROLE AND HE'S GREAT AT IT. THE PLOT IS FAST-MOVING AND FILLED WITH VIOLENCE. THE TWIST AT THE END IS AN INTERESTING TOUCH, AND CONSISTENT WITH <br />VINCENT'S (CRUISE) NIHILISTIC VIEW OF THE WORLD AND WHAT GOES ON IN IT. HOWEVER, I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THE MUSIC AS I WAS WATCHING THE MOVIE, WHICH RANGES FROM RAP TO CLASSICAL TO SALSA. I IMMEDIATELY WENT OUT AND BOUGHT THE SOUNDTRACK, AND LISTEN TO ALL OR PARTS ABOUT EVERY DAY. IF YOU LIKED \\"BLADE RUNNER\\", YOU'LL LOVE THE MOOD,ACTION, AND MUSIC OF \\"COLLATERAL\\".
B0002F6BRE|5.0|thsi is possibly the best christmas movie i have ever seen.  The only other movie i can think of that is remotley close to thsi is the classic, A christmas Story.  elf is funn and gets u into that christmas mood.  Parents need not worry about children watching this movie, it was great.  Will ferrel came up big, and i think this is his best movie yet.  One flaw in the movie though- it came out almost a year after its release in theatres.  Other than that i reccomend this to anybody, any age, anywhere.  Elf is an instant classic.
0380002930|5.0|My sixth-grade teacher was a jerk. Plain and simple. The man was an absolute terror--he'd make Professor Snape look like Captain Kangaroo. <br /> <br />But he did have one redeeming characteristic: He introduced me to the amazing \\"Watership Down\\". He read several chapters of it aloud in class, and this was the first Hardcover I ever purchased. I absorbed this book, fascinated by the characters, enthralled by the setting, thrilled by the amazing writing of Richard Adams who, in my opinion, never equalled this amazing novel. <br /> <br />I learned a valuable lesson from that teacher: Even the worst among us have something to contribute. I had a miserable year in Mr. Lin****'s class (name changed to protect the guilty, donthca know), but reading \\"Watership Down\\" made it almost bearable. You should buy this book. NOW.
B00005B36H|5.0|Let's kick it off... <br /> <br />The Grudge, It just comes right out banging, who would want anything else...

079284131X|4.0|Andy is a young boy who has no friends and wants this talking doll who's saying is \\"friends till the end\\". It is his dream birthday present and his mom manages to get him one from a bum off the street. The doll just happens to be possessed by a dead serial killer. The boy and the mom slowly realize this. Once they realize that the doll is evil and is killing people they need to try to convince other people including a cop played by Chris Sarandin (Fright Night). Chucky also wants out of doll form and eventually trys to get in Andy's body by chanting some special voo doo words lol. Anyway this movie is far more smart, scary and original than the sequels. The sequels just get dumber and dumber. Actually seeing the doll make these evil faces and cursing the first scene that Chucky reveals himself to the mother is both fun and scary. Now seeing him curse and be mean in the new movies is played out and just not scary any more.  All the originality and freshness can only be found in this movie. I mean now Chucky has a wife he got pregnant, dolls have sperm ? lol. So that's about as dumb the sequels got and can get after this smart and scary original.
B000069CWE|3.0|I have to say Linkin Park, gives great effort on this remix album, and that's all it should be looked at as, a remix album. Most people took this a little too seriously, saying it was leading to new sound from linkin park. There are some great tunes on here, Pushing Me Away gives a new feeling compared to the original, with new lyrics added on to it. My December, even though not as good as the original (of course) it does sound great, this is a great album to have, and to just have fun listening to, Linkin Park, just sounds like they're having fun here, and that's all this album is, it's LP having fun.
B000003TAW|5.0|i have just started to fully appreciate this album after having it and listening to it for so many years. The lyrics in songs like \\"the world had turned....\\" and \\"undone\\" to me have sunk in to create a loneliness that when i bought this cd when i was 14 i couldve imagined but after growing up and seeing the world i was able to appreciate on a different way.
B00005JMXX|3.0|Filled with visually captivating and beautiful (though it's destruction) scenery noticeably bereft of a solid story or even decent dialogue. There's a real contrast between halfway cogent scientific theories and meager everyday conversation in this film. Frequently the characters appear way too calm (as the world is apparently coming to end) and the plot-line of Quaid's character reaching his son in New York is almost laughable.<br /><br />Like Twister, an otherwise perfectly entertaining action/special effects movie is dragged down by a haphazard script and weak acting.<br /><br />It's a fun movie to watch and laugh at!
B000001EAQ|4.0|In 1995, U2 took time off from their 93' Zooropa World Tour, to create a soundtrack, with Brian Eno called 'Passengers' this would feature the bells and whistles of Achtung Baby and Zooropa, combined with atmospheric, electronica bits included. The cd didn't do so well, but it set U2 up for creating another cd. In 1997, U2 wanted to experiment with dance music. It was a current trend that was upcoming and U2 wanted to get on the wave and ride it high, they saw this as another chance to reinvent themselves.  Pop was through studies of dance club music and the mind and wonder of Brian Eno. U2 released Pop with 'Discotheque' and 'Staring At The Sun' both singles that did well on the charts. The album also belted out other numbers such as 'Gone' and 'Please' the album contains some of Bono and Edge's most heartful, dark and spiritual lyrics that the band has written to date. You will also find that the band comes together as a whole on this record, there are no loose ends or one member contributing to the record.  <br /> <br />U2 on this record, is both serious and humorous on this album. Poking fun at the wonders of what it takes to get through in this society and how to get into where to be (The Playboy Mansion, Miami) the album does contain a weirdness about it at times, songs like 'If You Wear That Velvet Dress' fail to bring us on a journey or tell us a story. Especially after hearing the powerful songs such as, \\"Gone\\", \\"Please\\", \\"Wake Up Deadman\\" and \\"Last Night On Earth.\\" <br /> <br />What most people won't understand about this album, is the fact U2 wanted to experiment again, reinvent themselves and look for a new musical direction. Most people will only know 'Staring At The Sun' and overlook bittersweet songs such as 'If God Will Send His Angels.' This is not a bad U2 album, but rather, released in a bad time. Techno/Dance/Electronica music was just making it's way to mainstream. Most people who picked up the record were expecting to hear another 'One' or 'Mysterious Ways' but in the end, were almost horrified by this new direction. Pop, now, is looked back on as a interesting musical piece, and one that helped U2 musically, and socially. Because just riding the wave of Achtung, Baby -- you can only go so far before you start resembling Rattle and Hum. Anyone who has enjoyed Achtung Baby and Zooropa, will definitely feel at home with this record.
B000002J0P|5.0|I was introduced to this album at the age of fourteen by my guitar teacher at that time.  I was fascinated by it then, and find it just as magical now, almost thirty years later.  Crosby, Stills, and Nash are all three good solo musicians on their own, but when they got together to record this album, they created magic as a trio.  Legend has it that they discovered just how wonderful their harmonies might be when they sang impromptu at a party at Joni Mithcell's in Laurel Canyon.  Supposedly, the very first song they actually recored together is \\"You Don't Have to Cry.\\"  I think it is rare that you will find songwriting, vocal harmonies, and musical prowess of this magnitude today.  These musicians poured their heart and soul into this project and it shows.  Neil Young once said that this group could have become the American version of the Beatles if they could have kept their egos in check; this CD certainly shows every bit of that kind of promise.  I love every song on this CD, but my favorites are \\"Marrakesh Express,\\" \\"Wooden Ships,\\" and \\"Helplessly Hoping.\\"  If you listen to the lyrics and emotion of \\"Wooden Ships,\\" I think it would be hard to argue the fact that this song would be a good representation of the Sixties in general.  Feel free to crank this album up, and in the words of David Crosby himself, \\"let your \\"freak flag\\" fly.\\"  A true classic; get it and enjoy the treasure that is CSN.
0385508417|5.0|outstanding story..a must read to get into the Christmas spirit, awaiting the movie to come out !
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Hugh Jackman is Hot, I love his acting and his movies.  I love Dracula movies.  I went to the theater to see this...it was horrible.  I sunk down in my seat embarrassed for Hugh...DON'T buy it!!! Save your money.  If you have to see it rent it.  UGH...what a waste of film.  It doesn't even deserve one star.
B00004XMV6|5.0|The first time that I saw this movie was ten years ago.  I was so stunned by the way that the director used Kim Bassinger's body parts to enhance this movie that I just had to buy it.  I did buy it--ten years later.  And everytime that I watch it I'm stil stunned by this dark love story.  The plot is very basic--girl meets boy/falls in love with boy--but boy turns out to be the Wrong Man!  What makes this movie so sad is that the director went to know degree to degrade Kim Bassinger in the easiest way possible.  Emotionally and sexually.  Mickey Rouke was just a male Spade in his meaningless pawn. \\"Kim Bassinger's Body\\" made this movie.  From the scene of her sitting in the screening room while thinking of Rouke--while touching herself to the all the time sex scenes--food fetishes-- and light dominant/baby doll scenes played by both Rouke and Kim, that kept the audience thinking... \\"She just needs to get the hell out of there!\\"  This movie was so sad in the end.  I happen to see 91/2 weeks 2 but it was nothing like the first 91/2 weeks. Kim Basinger's Body stole the show--actually it was the whole movie.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I couldn't have imagined the imprint this movie would have. I have seen Toby Maguire in Pleasantville and was rather confused as to why he was chosen for the lead role. This lasted until the scene in which he looks in the mirror after the spider bit him. From that point on I became convinced he was the 'born for the role'. The special effects appeared a bit C.G. in a couple of scenes, but this was overshadowed by the brilliance of the special effects as a whole. The message from Ben to Peter in the care 'with great power comes great responsibility' is an axiom. The movie with all of the action has a dare I say 'moral' message that all of us need to hear. I could go on and on. Just get the movie and you will see.
0780020685|5.0|Much of what I would say about this wonderful movie has already been said in other reviews, so I will add only that the commentary included with this DVD release - done by an expert on Japanese filmography whose name eludes me -  is better and more relevant than these commentaries usually are.  It provides great background information and explanations of what Kurosawa and his actors specifically do to make this film so great, and illuminates concepts and symbolism that are not familiar to Western audiences.  It revealed many things I missed or took for granted the first couple of times I saw the Seven Samurai and greatly enhanced my appreciation of this masterful film.
B000099T2L|5.0|Though this book may have been dubbed \\"The Animal Rights Bible\\" - it is interesting to note that nowhere in Singer's argument does he make a case for \\"rights\\" for animals. Singer's system of ethics is comprised of a form of utilitarianism that takes into account the interests of nonhuman animals. Thus, Singer's book is not an argument for \\"rights\\" for animals - Instead it is work intended to make a case for expanding our circle of compassion by considering the immense amount of unecessary suffering inflicted upon the nonhuman animal world by human institutions. In order to understand Singer's perspective, the reader must be willing to open their mind to the idea that our society is capable of change, and that we indeed can strive to live in peace with the nonhuman creatures with whom we share the Earth. Thus, an open-minded reader may be able to share in a vision of a more peaceful world in which we view other animals as creatures who are worthy of experiencing their own life - rather than as simple automatons that exist to be exploited as objects for human consumption. <br /> <br />
0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris's \\"The End of Faith: Religion, Terror and the Future of Reason,\\" is as cogent an argument as you will find for the need for humanity to save itself by abandoning its reliance on groundless religious myth as the guiding force in everything from relations between men and women to modern politics. Harris argues forcefully, reasonably, and convincingly that the willingness of billions of people to unquestioningly embrace and accept, without evidence, the stories (tall tales, really) of the Koran, the Bible, etc., as truth; and to view religions that don't square with their own with hatred, intolerance and violence; will certainly lead to our mutual annihilation.  <br /> <br />The book goes a long way to explain how otherwise rational people could fervently accept religious teachings that brand nonbelievers (and even those followers who have the temerity to question those teachings) - as inferior, evil, and in many cases, worthy of murder. Beginning with a section on the nature of belief, Harris moves through convincing examples of religion's responsibility for much of the misery and violence suffered throughout history. He focuses particularly on the extreme intolerance and religious superstitions of Islam. But Judaism, Catholicism and, particularly, Christianity, do not escape his examination unscathed. The book closes with an enlightening look at Eastern mysticism and consciousness, and in its epilogue, a plea for understanding and love between humans, and an abandonment of religious dogma, if we are to survive. <br /> <br />Those who already subscribe to Harris's arguments (myself) will feel that someone understands them and is in their corner. Religious moderates are singled out for justified scolding as wishy-washy enablers of the more extreme \\"true believers\\" in society -- they should definitely read this book to get themselves off the fence once and for all. Then there are the true believers, who can't prove a word of the dogma they spout but still accept it as the one and only truth (and think everyone else should too), and who refuse responsibility for how their beliefs affect the world around them. While they are the ones most in need of this book, they are the least likely to read it. But they'll surely be, without reading it, the most likely to rail against its contents. <br /> <br />Sam Harris's \\"The End of Faith: Religion, Terror and the Future of Reason,\\" is an extremely important book, and deserves a place in every library in the world. It should be required reading for college philosophy and theology courses, and for any political leader who invokes the name of you-know-who as justification for their actions. <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|Since I saw F911 on its opening night, I have been trying to understand why it is *so* hard to get people to see it! Then, I saw a talk on C-Span2 by the author of FahrenHYPE 911. Uh huh! That prompted me to look here. What detractors are doing is attacking a few of Michael Moore's weakest points, and ignoring his compelling and moving scenes.  Is there \\"Spin\\" in this documentary?  Of course! But wouldn't you like to separate the wheat from the chaff yourself? <br /> <br />Rent the DVD and decide for yourself.  If you saw the C-Span detraction, be sure to watch the Special Features, especially the interview of the European journalist who filmed the scenes of patrols in Iraq. <br /> <br />Finally, on this election eve, ask yourself WHY so many supporters of the Bush Administration are working overtime to make sure you don't see this documentary. <br /> <br />You Watch it - You Decide. <br />Then, VOTE tomorrow! <br />
B000002GJ7|5.0|_______________________________________________________________ <br />Thank you for taking the time to read my review. <br /> <br />One of the best Hard Rock Albums ever made. Ever! Plain and simple and if you like hard rock and guitar music then you are doing a disservice to your mind and soul to not own this album <br /> <br />EXTREME BIGGEST HIT WAS \\"MORE THAN WORDS\\" N IN MY OPINION IS THEIR WORST SONG EVER. Such an overrated Beatlesque type of song. FORGET ABOUT THIS \\"MTW\\" OVERRATED HIT & LISTEN TO THE NON HITS. THIS ALBUM WILL BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT! NUNO IS A guitar GOD! One of the greatest Guitarist of all time. PERIOD!  <br /> <br />THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS ALBUM IS THAT EVERY SONG IS DIFFERENT WHICH WAS TYPICAL OF EXTREME (GOING FROM ONE EXTREME TO ANOTHER). That is what made Extreme unique they evolved and did not stick to any trends. Anyone who thinks as them as just another HAIR BAND does not know what they are talking about.  <br /> <br />ALSO GARY CHERONE(VOCALIST) DOESN'T HOG THE STAGE, HE ALLOWED NUNO TO LET HIS FINGERS DO THE TALKIN' SOMETHING FEW SINGERS DO COS THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN TO SHUT UP & ALLOW THE GUITARIST TO PLAY. Why do you Think Eddie Van Halen hired him? No \\"LSD(Lead Singer Disease)\\" here as Eddie Van Halen put it. I HAVE YET TO HEAR A BAND OTHER THAN GUNS N' ROSES THAT HAD A GUITARIST THAT HAD THE AWESOME EXTREMEly LONG GUITAR SOLOS in a mainstream hard rock band. IF YOU WANT 2 HEAR A CD THAT WILL BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT THIS IS IT. <br />   This album sounds as fresh today as it did back then. This album should be up there with: <br /> <br />Van Halen's \\"Van Halen(1st album)\\" <br />Guns N' Roses's \\"Apettite For Destruction\\" <br />Motley Crue's \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" <br />Rainbow's \\"Rainbow Rising\\" <br /> <br />As one of the greatest hard Rock albums of all-time. The guitar solos alone are worth it just simply awesome guitar fret work that only Nuno Bettencourt could of produced. This is one of my favorite albums of all time and can listen to itfrom start to finish and still brings a smile to my face when I hear the EXTREMEly long guitar solos. <br /> <br />\\"N REMEMBER PABLO \\"HE'S NOT THE CUTE ONE.\\" <br /> <br />My Advice is to: <br />GO BUY, BORROW, BEG, OR STEAL THIS ALBUM! <br />CHEERS MATE! CHEERS! <br /> <br />COKE08 <br />coke08_discount <br />________________________________________________________________ <br />
0897500482|5.0|I seriously doubt if there is a better work addressing the martial arts and the philosophy and mystique surrounding them.<br />This is one you must have in your collection.  It is not a book that can be enjoyed or used in just one reading.  It is a book to dwell upon and enjoyed and learn from over a long period of time, with several (actually, many) readings required.  The simple and quaint illustrations are worth a long look alone.  I truely feel that even those not particularly interested in this subject would be able to learn from it and find the work interesting.  I highly recommend.
B00005ASOI|3.0|I have very mixed feeling about this movie.  On the one hand, it does have two or three scenes which are breathtakingly gorgeous and superbly atmospheric.  I'm talking about the scene where the girls are sleeping in the dance studio, surrounded by sheets hung in a circle, bathed in red light from behind.  Also, the scene where the blind guy is walking around the grounds of someplace resembling the Reichstag.  Those scenes are as memorable as any I've ever witnessed. <br /> <br />However, that's about all the movie has going for it.  Many, many other scenes left me thinking to myself \\"Oh, enough with the red lights already.\\"  At no time did I ever feel scared watching this \\"greatest horror movie of all time\\", nor was I ever interested in the plot because there was simply nothing to be interested in.  The theme music was merely annoyingly loud, and not \\"great\\" in any way.  Some of the dialogue was really laughable, like the line about \\"Any girl who's name begins with an 'S' is a sssssnake\\".  Where on earth did that come from?   <br /> <br />Overall, I guess I would recommend this movie, but you'll enjoy the experience much more if you go into it with low expectations.  Expect a supremely artsy movie that, for every 50 attempts at creating a masterpiece, succeeds once and to a greater or lesser degree fails the other 49 times.  All this frivolous nonsense about it being \\"the greatest horror movie of all time\\" will most likely leave you terribly disappointed.
B00006HBB6|4.0|Obviously \\"The Joshua Tree\\" was U2's breakthrough album, but in retrospect I would make a case for \\"War\\" being their most pivotal work. In a word, this is the point where the lyrics catch up with the hard-rock music. You can listen to \\"Boy\\" and \\"October\\" and find the sound, which in the beginning was focused on the Edge's jagged guitar riffs (\\"I Will Follow\\" is the best song from those two albums), but the lyrics are pretty much just something for Bono to do while the band rocks on and his intial attempts at communicating any sort of message seemed youthful indulgence at best.<br /><br />However, when we get to \\"War,\\" things have clearly changed. If the title and the cover shot (a young boy, his lower lip bloodied, his hands locked behind his head a standard pose of submission), then the lyrics of \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" quickly settle the matter.  There is still anger and dispair, but now there is an undeniable sense of passion as well.  Along with \\"Seconds,\\" \\"New Year's Day,\\" and \\"'40'\\" they place \\"the Troubles\\" at the heart of the album's gestalt. The political position they are taking vis-a-vis the sectarian strife in Northern Island is rather nebulous, but there is a potency to the music and the lyrics hitherto unfelt in U2's songs (forever captured in the memorable music video of the group performing the song at Red Rocks). But then there is nothing wrong with offering awareness and concern rather than solutions. This is a problem that has been boiling over for centuries.<br /><br />The love song \\"Two Hearts Beat as One\\" might seem out of place amidst the righteous anger of these other tracks, especially with the mix of disco rhythms and funky guitar, but then love is but another battlefield where desperation reigns.  Even in that regard U2 can clearly be seen as moving on to the next level in their ascent.  When an artist or group makes it big, there is a tendency among their true fans (defined as those who were in on the action before the bandwagon loaded up), to look back at one of their \\"early\\" albums with great nostaglic affection. For U2 that album would have to be \\"War.\\"d up), to look back at one of their \\"early\\" albums with great nostaglic affection. For U2 that album would have to be \\"War.\\" <br /> <br />
B000002J1U|5.0|(Actual Rating- 4.5 Stars)<br /><br />Led Zeppelin III(1970). Led Zeppelin's Third Album.<br /><br />In 1969, Led Zeppelin released 'Led Zeppelin II', arguably their finest album, and undoubtedly an improvement over their debut. In 1970, Led Zeppelin came out with 'Led Zeppelin III', Led Zeppelin's most experimental album, where they went back to their Folk, Couuntry, and Blues roots. Although it sold well at first, because of it's failure to produce a sizeable hit and the experimental nature of the album, 'Led Zeppelin III' became Led Zeppelin's least popular album to date, spawning only one hit, \\"Immigrant Song\\". Although the album sold poorly(compared to their other albums), and may be their least accessible and most experimental, is Led Zeppelin III still a solid album worthy of your purchase? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Track Ratings-<br /><br />Immigrant Song- An energetic rocker, \\"Immigrant Song\\" combines Bonham's frenzied drumming and John Paul Jones insane bassline, not to mention Page's and Plant's medieval-ish melody. Very short, yet definitely one of Zeppelin's best.<br /><br />Friends- An odd song, \\"Friends\\" seems to be a folk song with gothic undertones, combining eerie violin melodies along with Page's sad and rather depressing chords. Plant's eerie vocals only add to this song, which, while a little odd, still seems to me to be a masterpiece.<br /><br />Celebration Day- An instant classic, \\"Celebration Day\\" is a Zeppelin song that could've easily been a hit, but sadly wasn't. Featuring trippy and psychadelic axework from Page and bluesy basslines from Jones, \\"Celebration Day\\" sounds similar to many a Jimi Hendrix song, and Plant's vocals perfectly fit the part. A great, fun song.<br /><br />Since I've Been Loving You- With \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\", Led Zeppelin brings to mind Jimi Hendrix's timeless epic \\"Voodoo Child\\", which was a bluesy highlight to 'Electric Ladyland'. Although only half it's length, \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" is just as good, an all-out blues number, featuring some jazz grooves and soulful vocals. Page finds time to show off his talent whenever he can, and this jazzy ballad evolves into an epic that shows why Led Zeppelin are considered genuises.<br /><br />Out On The Tiles- Another song that should've been a hit, \\"Out On The Tiles\\" is an energetic rocker that reminds me of The Who's psychadelia and pop sensibilities, combined with the headbanging and distorted melodies of Deep Purple. Plant definitely sings his heart out here, and \\"Out On The Tiles\\" is very similar to Zeppelin's hit song \\"Heartbreaker\\".<br /><br />Gallows Pole- An addictive rocker, \\"Gallows Pole\\" is a song influenced by Folk and Country, and even a touch of Bluegrass. Page goes insane with his guitar(and banjo), laying down some crazy riffs, and Jone's thumping bassline keeps the song alive. Plant, as usual, carries the song with his energetic and *country-fied* singing. While it may sound a tad corny, \\"Gallows Pole\\" works as well as anything Zeppelin did before and after this.<br /><br />Tangerine- An underrated classic, \\"Tangerine\\" bears a heavy resemblance to \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", with the same symphonic guitar melodies and touching vocals, yet with a slightly more folk and country influenced sound. Although not as good as \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", certainly still a great song.<br /><br />That's The Way- Another slow country rocker, \\"That's The Way\\" sounds a little redundant using the same style as the past few songs, yet, it's still a decent song with a nice rhythm and interesting axework. Plant is definitely the highlight with his brooding vocals, yet, not enough happens to make this one of Zeppelin's finest.<br /><br />Bron-Y-Aur Stomp- While another Country influenced song, \\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\\" is far from redundant: if you aren't stomping your feet by the end of the song, you're probably not sober. Page and Jones create a thick, bluegrass influenced rhythm with their respective instruments, and Bonham's pulsingpercussion lays the perfect background from this zany and addictive masterpiece.<br /><br />Hats Off To (Roy) Harper- Absolutely *nothing* happens in this song except for Plant senselessly wailing for what seems like forever. Definitely the worst song Led Zeppelin ever released.<br /><br />Overall, Led Zeppelin III is probably Led Zeppelin's weakest release, yet, in my eyes, it's still an undeniable classic that just happens to have a few flaws. Since Led Zeppelin's Folk and Country influences are much more pronounced here than on other releases, that may turn many people off, but to anyone willing to give it a try, they will find an album that surely won't fail to please.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF CLASSIC ROCK, FOLK, COUNTRY, AND LED ZEPPELIN! A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND SLIGHTLY FLAWED, YET UNDENIABLY GOOD!<br /><br />Also Recommended-<br /><br />IV- Led Zeppelin<br /><br />Fresh Cream- Cream<br /><br />Axis: Bold As Love- Jimi Hendrix<br /><br />Thanks For Reading!nd Bonham's pulsing percussion lays the perfect background from this zany and addictive masterpiece. <br /> <br />Hats Off To (Roy) Harper- Absolutely *nothing* happens in this song except for Plant senselessly wailing for what seems like forever.

B000002H6C|5.0|Incredible style of rock, and the most complex album you are ever likely to hear! There is absolutely no other band on the planet that could do this. I am not going to describe this album simply because it would take up a million pages, if you have never heard anything off this album take a listen to 'one' that will be my review! The only downside was the quality of production which is an absolute travesty! Flemming ramussen should be sent to jail! If this album had been produced under bob rock this would have been the greatest heavy metal album ever! The justice melody off binge and purge will pound your face into a pulp, you can hear all the instruments as they should have been although it is live.
B0002234LS|2.0|Johnny Depp is a good actor, but he doesn't \\"save\\" this movie, and frankly - in my opinion anyway - he did not deserve an Academy nomination for Pirates of the Carribian neither. He hasn't quite \\"convinsed\\" me yet, though I thought he was superb in Sleepy Hollow, he did a great job there. <br /> <br />Well, Secret Window. This movie doesn't tempt me to open the Stephen King-book which it is based on. The story is so ungripping, and the end comes so sudden on you (in the movie anyway), and when I realized \\"the plot\\" the only thing I could say was : Is that all?  <br /> <br />A movie doesn't have to be perfect to be watchable, 3 stars means watchable and entertainig, but this movie really is a waste of time. Because of the ending of the movie I'm not sure if it deserves two stars even, but perhaps this is just my disappointment in the twelve dollars I just wasted on this sad attempt of a thriller.  <br /> <br />If you are a Johnny Depp-fan, you might enjoy it. Nothing's different about him here, he acts in the same old style - but unless you are a BIG fan, he probably isn't worth it in this one.
B000002H97|5.0|My journey with rock started with the black album, i have listened to a zillion other bands of all rock genres and this is still the most astounding, heavy, catchy rock album i have ever listened to. If you are looking for hard melodic rock just buy it cos you wont find anything else quite like it.
B00005221M|3.0|Yes, I am one of those \\"idiots\\" (as one reviewer put it) that read the book and preferred it to the movie. And no, I don't recommend that you throw away the book.  Cooper's book makes for difficult reading if you are not used to that style of English, but I find it much easier to read than Shakespeare.  So tear yourself away from cheap romance fiction and give his book a whirl, it is much richer and more interesting than the movie, and much more sympathetic toward Native Americans than some reviewers have given it credit for.    <br /> <br />What bothered me the most about the movie is the divergence in the plot and some of the characterisation, which in my opinion cheapened the movie somewhat. I don't agree that a movie should diverge from the novel A LOT, as it did in this case.  Especially if it's based on such a good novel as this one.  An example of a movie that stayed pretty close to the novel (one that is much longer) was Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings.  He cut several things in the interest of time, such as the Tom Bombadil part, but the parts that remained are pretty faithful to the original trilogy in characterisation and plot.  I am a LOTR fan, so I was really watching for this in that movie trilogy. <br /> <br />Outlined below are some of the major differences between the Last of the Mohicans novel and the 1992 movie.  These have already been mentioned by other reviewers, but I will recap and add a few of my own: <br /> <br />1) This is the biggie: Hawkeye is a very gritty, down to earth persona, not given to flowery speech and niceties, in the novel. He is not the sexy romantic hunk portrayed in the movie, but a middle aged man who dressed in the same buckskins day after day without a bath. He also was NOT in love with Cora or any woman in the book.  He is the central character, an expert sharpshooter, and consummate woodsman, trained by his companion Chingachgook. He is NOT part Indian, as presented in the movie, but schooled by them. <br /> <br />2) Cora's mother was a Caribbean woman descended partially from slaves, so she had some black blood.  This was not in any way in evidence in the movie.  Even though Cora had dark eyes and long dark hair, she was not even faintly mulatto.  Alice was her half-sister whose mother was Scotch, like her father Munro.  Her features were much more fair than Cora's, as described in the novel.  In the movie, Alice's features did not reflect pure Scotch background, and were not very fair. <br /> <br />3) Cora had a love interest with Uncas, not with Hawkeye. It was understated in the book, but was definitely there. Duncan Heyward had the love interest with Alice, not Cora.  Remember the time in which Cooper was writing (early 1800's), and was depicting a time of the mid to late 18th century.  Cora being a mixed-race woman was more acceptably presented as being involved with a non-white man, where Alice (\\"lily-white\\") was more acceptably presented as being involved with an upper-class Englishman. <br /> <br />4) Magua definitely desired to marry Cora, partially because it would be a prize to marry the daughter of his one-time British captor, Munro. Magua detested Munro and all the British because they had impisoned and whipped him for drunkenness, when he had deserted his own tribe (who were loyal to the French) to work for them against the French.  To be whipped in public was a major humiliation for an Indian. Also, when he was missing from his tribe, another tribe member took Magua's wife to be his own wife, since he was considered dead or deserted.  Magua had wanted to return to his wife.  Another reason Magua wanted to marry Cora was because of course, she was beautiful.  Again, Cooper here felt it was \\"safer\\" to have Magua desire Cora rather than Alice, since Cora was not all-white. When Magua returned to his tribe, he had to switch loyalty back to the French, so this, together with his humiliation, is one reason that he betrayed his old \\"friends\\" the British.  Nearly all of this was missing in the movie, instead it showed that Magua just hated Munro.  This cut down on the complexity of Magua's character. In spite of this, I must say that Wes Studi still did a fine job in his portrayal.  I assume he read the novel, so that he could know the war that was waging inside of his character. <br /> <br />5) Heyward is not Hawkeye's snotty British enemy/rival in the novel at all.  In fact, Heyward is one of the heroes, and cooperates with Hawkeye.  In the novel, it is interesting how Heyward starts out from complete ignorance of frontier conditions, and being motivated only by his gallant desire (and duty) to protect both of Munro's daughters, learns from Hawkeye and his Mohican friends how to cope in the wild, while battling French and hostile Indians. In the novel, he is a solicitous suitor to Alice, and very brave and constant in his protectiveness toward both of the women, risking his life in several situations. <br /> <br />6) A missing component in the movie is the character of David Gamut. He is  Cooper's \\"divine fool\\".  His main aim in life is to render \\"psalmody\\" (an old fashioned word for singing hymns) to all who will listen.  He carries around a tuning pipe, which he uses to start himself off on the proper note, after which he launches into a melodious rendition of one of his hymns.  Hawkeye grudgingly listens, and disparages David for carrying around the tuning pipe rather than a trusty musket.  When David is captured by the hostile Hurons, we expect that he will be speedily dispatched, since he knows absolutely nothing about defending himself.  However, in an amusing twist, the Indians are awed by the singer's desire to trust in God for his fate when he immediately begins singing right in the middle of their slaughter of the innocents retreating from the Fort.  They also are influenced by his accomplished singing ability.  They capture him without harming him, and then allow him to come and go in their village, not treating himwith any great honor, but not getting in his way either.  They considered it bad luck to interfere with anyone so divinely inspired.  This treatment of David gives the reader more of an understanding of the way the Indians at that time felt about the divine, so I was very disappointed when this part was not shown.   <br /> <br />7) In the movie, the colonists' house was portrayed as being burned, and they were killed by Indian war parties loyal to the French.  This leads to somewhat of a rebellion in the Fort, by the colonists who want to desert the British overlords and return to their families to protect them from the war parties.  This makes the British, who refuse to let them go, look like nasty slave-drivers.  Also Hawkeye is thrown in the brig at the fort for taking up the colonists' cause.  This was all added by director Mann, and is missing in the book.  Cooper is actually pro-British in the book, and considers the French duplicitous (like Martin in the movie the Patriot).  The colonists are eager to stand with the British, and no rebellion occurs.  In fact Col. Munro is very respectful of Hawkeye for his great skill with the rifle, and consummate woodsmanship.  He is also very grateful toward him and his companions for bringing his daughters safely to the Fort. <br /> <br />8) When the British abandon the Fort William Henry, Col Munro is depicted in the movie as being killed by Magua and his heart taken out.  In the book, Munro escapes with his daughters, with the help of Hawkeye and the Mohicans, along with Heyward. <br /> <br />9) One of the biggest disagreements I have with one of the reviewers was when he/she said that Cooper was down on Native Americans. This person did not really read the book, it seems.  For a novel of its time, it is one of the most sensitive portrayals.  And also Cooper was further back in time closer to the time of initial white contact with Indian cultures, so he had the advantage of knowing what they were really like more than we do.  His portrayals of Indians are far more sensitive that those depicted in the Hollywood Westerns I grew up with. Cooper does not favor all Indians obviously; he distrusts the Hurons not because they were Hurons but because they sided with the French (the pro-British bias again).  And he portrayed Magua as a tortured person who had been introduced to alcohol by the white man, then publicly punished by him when he didn't know how to handle it.  This and the loss of his wife hurt Magua and turned him to evil. He is not portrayed as a naturally \\"evil Indian\\" in the book at all.  One problem I do have with the movie is that Uncas and his father Chingachgook (called the \\"Sagamore\\", or wise man) are portrayed more as sidekicks to the handsome Hawkeye stud figure (with Uncas as a secondary stud-figure), but in the book, Uncas and his father are more central, with Hawkeye constantly relying on them for their judgement and skill in the woods.  The book is filled with admiring references to Uncas's features, calm, steady manner, courage, swiftness, and overall attitude.  Also present in the book are several comments by Hawkeye defending the Indians' ways and religious beliefs.  In that day Christians assumed that all Indians were pagans and destined for hellfire.  Hawkeye clearly does not believe in such nonsense, but explains to some of his British friends that Indians generally believed in a monotheistic God, or \\"Great Spirit\\", and not in a huge number of pagan \\"gods\\", and that they had moral codes, and strong family life, etc.  Not exactly a dismissive portrayal of Native Americans here, especially for the period in which it was written. <br /> <br />10) References to European religious rivalries: not mentioned in the movie. One of the biggest factors in the rivalry between Britain and France was the continuing war between the Catholic Church and Protestantism (combining both the state Protestantism of England and the various sects practiced by the colonists).  In thebook a mention was made by one of Hawkeye's party about the \\"Jesuitical idolators\\" across the border in Canada, and what a threat they were considered to be by the Protestant colonists.  It made a natural ally out of Britain, although of course many of the colonists had escaped the oppression of state Protestantism in Britain.  These colonists considered the Anglican Church a lesser evil than the Pope.   <br /> <br />11) Col. Munro was portrayed as quite harsh in the movie, and showed very little affection toward his daughters.  The book showed him as an older man, and desperately glad to have his daughters with him again at the Fort, especially considering all the dangers that they had passed through.   <br /> <br />All this having been said, the movie has some redeeming qualities, such as beautiful scenery, inspiring music, historically accurate weaponry and buildings for the period, and wonderful costumes.  And good performances by many, in spite of the unfaithful characterisation and writing by the director and his staff.  Just read the book instead of dismissing it as old-fashioned, and you will get an even richer experience.than the movie can offer.  But even the best movies are usually not as good as the book, if the book is that good.  And it's quite good.  In spite of negative comments about the \\"mediocre\\" book made here, don't believe it, read it for yourself. <br />
B00005ASOI|4.0|Now, I will state from the beginning outright that this is one of the only films of Argento's that I have seen. With that stated, I rated this 4 out of 5 stars since out of the two films I've seen I really have no basis for comparison that would be fairly accurate. <br /> <br />The complaints coming from other reviewers are slightly unjust, possibly some are conventional fans of the horror genre itself and aren't all that familiar with Argento's work.  <br /> <br />Argento has admitted that he is a director who prefers style over substance and more often than not he has a dislike of working with actors. He enjoys them as other human beings, but he believes that focus shouldn't solely stay on them throughout an entire film. <br /> <br />With that out of the way, let me get down to the actual review of Suspiria: <br /> <br />This is truly a classic film, but it is one that needs to be viewed not with high expectations but fairly low ones. The visual styles Argento implemented along with his unconventional camera shots are truly innovative and when viewing this film, you will notice that a lot of modern directors have borrowed a trick or two from him. <br /> <br />Suspiria is the first entry into a scrapped, then (supposedly) renewed trilogy of films, centered around The Three Mothers, figures of diabolical evil that inhabit various parts of the world. <br /> <br />The plot centers around an American dancer who comes to a foreboding dance academy and bears witness to a strange series of events. <br /> <br />Soon after the opening sequence, a sense of paranoia lurks beneath the entire film. The viewer bears witness to a murder of two of the dance academy girls while never knowing who or what exactly killed them. A heightened feeling of mystery accompanies the paranoia, as soon after, the American girl and her newfound roommate soon try to uncover the source of all the strange things that occur in what appears to be a haunted dance academy. <br /> <br />I do not want tospoil anything for those interested in the film, so I will stop there with the plot overview. <br /> <br />What makes this film an effective piece of horror and suspense is not only the paranoia and mystery embedded firmly within it, but the visuals created by it as well. Vivid colors merge with dark backlights and help to create an atmosphere which adds to the mental anguish of the viewer. When I first viewed this film, it was almost as if it were surreal in the way it looked. <br /> <br />One staple of any horror film, be it foreign in origin or not, is a decent soundtrack. Without one, the film will most likely fail to appease a viewer. With Suspiria, Argento teamed with his frequent collaborator, the italian progressive rock band Goblin, and the score and soundtrack for the film that was composed meshes seamlessly with the film. <br /> <br />During a critical scene, the music will swell and add an eerie ambience as the viewer's tension level will rise as they expect one thing to happen and will witness another. A few people have argued that the music is a distraction in certain scenes, but I personally disagree. Certain scenes within Suspiria wouldn't work well if they lacked the music Goblin had produced. <br /> <br />Argento's camera work here is nothing short of amazing on many levels. The placement of the camera focusing on a wide shot as it looms over the balcony above a massive in-door swimming pool almost adds an effect that leaves the viewer wondering if the pool down below is being watched by some unseen murderer or evil villain without having the distinction of footsteps going toward the balcony or any other noise that would denote so. <br /> <br />The actors and actresses in this film did do a mildly pleasing job with the script. Some of the lines come out forced or stiff, but overall, if a viewer isn't looking for someone to act (or overact, as the case may be) on the level of say, Humphrey Bogart or Marilyn Monroe, then they would be hard pressed tofixate upon and find themselves disappointed by the way the actors helped move the story along. <br /> <br />Overall, Suspiria is a brilliant film in my opinion. I cannot state that it is one of Argento's best ever, but I do know that I enjoyed it greatly. This review is merely my opinion though, with a few additional bits of information for those interested in viewing or purchasing it, and as such should not be considered the final answer on it nor should it be considered the worst either. <br /> <br />Suspiria is a film that not all fans of horror or suspense will truly enjoy. Those fans who are spoiled on more modern films of the same ilk may view it and unfairly pass a death sentence on it afterward, but people who wish to simply broaden their experience within the canon of many films like this may end up adding this film into their personal \\"best of\\" or \\"Top 50\\" lists.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|OK, it was a bit over goth.  I wish all the vampires did not dress tlike they came from a White Wolf party at Dragoncon but of whell.  The plot story was great, acting great.  I liked it so much I got the two disc version.  I hope they make a sequel.
B00008GKEG|4.0|Don't get me wrong,this DVD set is the most fun I've had in a long time,excellent sound and picture quality.After watching it a few times though,I've became aware of how John Lennon is shorted in the editing.In the early live concerts you get plenty of Paul and George harmonizing but John is way over to the side,almost not seen.More of Pauls early songs are included,when everyone knows John dominated this period.The cuts throughout the whole set that include John seem to be those that cast him into the worst light.We all know Paul is trying to re-write history by casting himself as the real leader of the Beatles,we also know he was more of a domineering snit with lousy ideas.By merely surviving Lennon he can now edit and slant and re-mix classics so that they cast him in the best light.Everyone knows Paul falls short of John and George in his solo work,when the Beatles stopped,so did he,but he keeps pounding out these same old crappy ditties acting like we must all love them because of who he once was.In the Anthology he treats George Harrison like he's an idiot,some things never change despite the passage of time.Yet in one scene he looks at him knowing that Harrisons solo work makes his own pale in comparison.He seems nervous around George,no wonder,all the crappy things he said and done to the man,and yet,here he is,an equal,no longer just a guitar player but an equal in the songwriting department.Paul tells the viewer many times\\"I'm a big fan of Johns\\",but he doesn't say the same of George or Ringo.I enjoyed watching this Series just for the unsaid things,the interaction between Paul and George,for as long as George was living Paul could not get away with his revisionist re-write of the groups efforts.Now that George is gone I'm afraid all Beatle fans will suffer at the hands of this pompous tyrant.If John were here he would just tell him to shut up.
B00009TB5G|5.0|In life there are so many things that happen.  There are good things, bad things, really bad things.  But some times, although very rarely a perfect thing happens.  Like rain coming down on a dry desert.  This movie was kinda like that.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|WOW.  i saw these guys in cleveland and this was even more fun to watch.  this dvd allows you to see everthing.  the special features are real cool.  mike's drum solo was nice.  the multiangle special feature was nice since i am a bassist i never get to see the bass player and now i can.  it was quite impressive.  after watching it i felt like a failure as a musician becaue i could never do that if i practiced for another 10 years.  back to the video.  the picture quality is very good.  it is in fullscreen format.  would rather have the widescreen but that is not a big thing.  the music quality is also good.  like i said before the only thing that comes to mind is WOW.  this i think is superior to the live scenes dvd from a few years ago.  this is a full concert rather than an excerpt with change of season at the end.  the tallent of these men is just disgusting.  it is just amazing what they do and it is so effortless.  i enjoyed this dvd and the special stuff very much.  i just have to wait to get the cds till christmas.
B00009ATKS|5.0|Mogwai has created a masterpiece in this lush \\"Happy Songs For Happy People.\\"  Though the name may seem quite contradictory at first, over time the idea of it sinks in.  This CD changes you in that every single note in it represents a moment in your life.  The sweet sounds of it all just lulls the listener into a trance like state and captures every emotion.  From the haunting sounds of the openning \\"Hunted By A Freak,\\" creating that sensation of being lost and incomplete.  But as the album progresses you can almost tangible feel the scenes it makes in the music so beautifully.  The feeling of being lost transitions into anger as \\"Ratts of the Capital\\" climaxes and descends into the feelings of love take effect in \\"Golden Porsche\\" and the heart is finally captured in \\"I Know You, But What Am I?\\"  Then finally in \\"Stop Coming To My House\\" a sense of wholeness hits and makes the listener feel at peace once and for all. <br /> <br />Listen to to this CD.  It'll change your life.
B00005JNEI|3.0|If you don't know by now Fahrenheit 9/11 is a documentary about Why the Bush family should not be in America or presidency. Michael Moore attacks with video and film footage on the history of the Bush family and its ties with the Saudi family. Michael Moore starts with the senior Bush and then goes after President Bush by using suggestive ties between the Saudis and Bush families.<br /><br />The director tries to use film clips with commentary to convince the viewer that President George W. Bush is guilty by association and corrupted by oil money. Greed from the highest position in the land is thrown into convincing fashion by film and research facts. Can this hold up in a court of law? Probably not! I'm sure this film would be part of the evidence collected to bring down President George W. Bush if it was brought up in a court of law.<br /><br />The director would have us believe that President Bush is not American by his ties with the Saudis. I believe the true purpose of this film is to bring down the current President Bush's regime and vanish the Bush name to corruption. Michael Moore does have some balls to take on the President Bush though. Its one thing to take on the NRA, but the highest and most powerful person in the world!<br /><br />Only in American can a film director take on the most powerful leader in the world and get away with it. I believe if all of this was true of the Bush family with its billions and billions of dollars at stake in oil and secrecy held in trust, that President Bush or his family keeps it a secret by using his so called influence. Maybe a disappearing act!  Would the Bushes let a documentary film director film and distribute a film with all this bashing of the family name? If this was true!<br /><br />With the majority of the media already under the influence of political parties, can a blatant attack on President George W. Bush by a filmmaker be crushed before it was made? Of course it could. Maybe the political hype and influence in film was underestimated by the Bush family as comes with the territory. Can a film bring down a presidency? We shall see! Any ramifications from this film are still being made and will show in the future.<br /><br />Everyone blames or believes in the highest position in America.by the Bush family as comes with the territory. Can a film bring down a presidency? We shall see! Any ramifications from this film are still being made and will show in the future.    Everyone blames or believes in the highest position in America.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|Cold Mountain has  the backdrop of the terrible suffering of the Civil War, not just on the soldiers but on the civilians who lost so much. It depicts the hardships the people of a small town in North Carolina suffered through as they received reports of lost husbands and sons. Jude Law is a good actor with the skills to portray the war's sufferings, overcome the tragedies he experiences and continue back to his love, Nicole Kidma as Ada shows the talents of her acting even with her difficulties with a southern accent. Rene Zellweiger is a great as Ruby, the rough but tender hearted southern gal. The story continues to move along, almost like the Odysseus tale of the man trying to fight his way back home. There are some disturbing scenes that are not appropriate for small children. The story keeps the viewer engaged while telling is a visually intriguing way. The ending will leave you in tears, as the tragedies of the Civil War affected so many lives in the south.
B00006690G|1.0|Now he's trying to tell us not to vote for the current president when Eminem gained all his fame and success over these last 4 years while Bush has been in office? Sure, the two facts aren't directly related, but Bush at least upholds that freedom to where we are free to say what we want and can choose which kind of cd's to buy. Eminem's lucky he got the breaks and the attention he has, and it has all been mainly with Bush in office. Remember: Al Gore was going to tighten the freedom of the mass media, and Eminem may have not been able to say what he has said with Gore in office! It reaffirms my faith that an idiot like him is trying to tell us not to vote for Bush, like he has the authority to influence our votes! I will do anything other than what he tells us to do, because Eminem is just a f*cking pop star, a sellout, and a hypocrite. His career hasn't faltered yet, it will eventually, and his sins have been done on a national level. What goes around comes around! He's had two uncles that have committed suicide, and not because of him, but this is an example of his sins coming back to haunt him. And if Eminem's brother ever gets called to war, that would be a prime example in itself. Sorry, for what Eminem has done, he will pay, but most likely not in finances. His music really ain't that good, so much Hiphop is better, and quit listening to him just because MTV tells you to!
141931176X|4.0|When I was done with my long road-trip, I was so enthralled by the story that I put my CD's into the player at home and crouched in front of it for another two hours, spell-bound. It was written with laborious, vivid detail that haunts the reader's imagination long after the story is done. I also appreciate the historical accuracy and was inflamed with curiosity about Vermeer's paintings-- I had to see every one of them, and they were just as described in the novel. Just amazing. There are many things about this book that could be discussed and debated, which is to me what makes this book literary.

B00005UEAR|4.0|Before the release of \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\" Dream Theater had already set down their legacy in the world of Progressive Metal. They were a force to be reckoned with, with such phenominal albums such as \\"Images and Words\\", \\"Awake\\", \\"A Change of Seasons\\", and of course \\"Scenes from a Memory.\\" I didn't know what to expect out of 6DOIT honestly. Reading the reviews here and other places I've heard many positive, yet many negative things about it also.  <br /> <br />I had heard things like the first disc is good but the second disc is skippable. I even know someone who completely stopped listening to Metal after listening to the second disc. It was things like this that made me hesitant in purchasing this. I finally got around to buying it, and I must say that I find nothing at all wrong with the second disc.  <br /> <br />Sure, the 42 mintue epic song \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\" is mellow, but whenever you listen to it you have to know what you are listening to. It portrays such mellowness on parts of the song like \\"About to Crash\\", \\"Goodnight Kiss\\", \\"Solitary Shell\\", and \\"Grand Finale/Losing Time\\". And they aren't bad at all. \\"About to Crash\\" is a fun part of the epic, as is \\"Losing Time\\". \\"Solitary Shell\\" has a very uplifting feel to it and I've fallen in love with it already.  <br /> <br />Now, the real gem of this double disc set is the first song on the album \\"The Glass Prison\\". It is Dream Theater's heaviest song, it is also epic clocking in at just below 14 minutes. It has great lyrics based on Alcoholism, and has so many great riffs and solos. I must say that I also enjoy the keyboards that Jordan Rudess shows in this song. Also have to give kudos to Mike Portnoy for his usual excellent drumming in the song, which we come to expect out of him now.  <br /> <br />Other highlights include \\"The Great Debate\\", which is an excellent song based on Stem Cell research. And also \\"Blind Faith\\" is excellent too.  <br /> <br />So, in conclusion, don't hesitate to buy this like I did. Just ignore all of the bad reviews and go out and have an opinion for yourself. <br />
0780020685|5.0|Donald Richie thought it was Kurosawa's finest, and suggested that it might the best Japanese film ever made.<br /><br />It is a film that rewards casual viewing, careful viewing, repeated viewing and viewing over time. Isn't that rather like a wonderful book, that rewards you every time you pick it up? I suppose that is the definition of greatness.<br /><br />How was this greatness achieved? (This is not a rhetorical question. It truly astonishes me how this film creates meaning...cutting across all boundaries of nationality, language, and culture to become a meaningful personal experience for those who view it). This creation of greatness may be a mystery, but we can point to the some features of the film's excellence:<br /><br />The achievement:<br />This simple but complexly nuanced human story, the music, the cinematography, the editing and the acting all conspire to create a world that becomes ours on a deeply personal level. It is a film which influences later films and filmmakers.<br /><br />The story:<br />Based on an original concept of Kurosawa's which began as a \\"day in the life\\" documentary of a samurai's existence, Kurosawa developed the idea into this breathtaking film of samurai who save a village.<br /><br />The actors:<br />These are characters you will love, people you need to have in your life: the characters of Kyuzo, Heihachi and the unforgettable Bokuzen Hidari as a bewildered peasant..! Takeshi Shimura, as the leader of the samurai, Gambei, is the embodiment of wisdom, and calm in the storm.  And, saying that Toshiro Mifune has star power is like saying the noonday sun sheds a little warmth.<br /><br />Toshiro: It's  the cut of his jawline when he asks the village patriarch, \\"Got a problem, grandad?\\", and the most charming look of confusion and embarassment playing over his face when he is told by Heihachi that he is the triangle on the samurai flag. It's his energy, speed and agility and power and intelligence. Mifune sniffing out the fuse of a gun in the woods, bouncing through the brush half-naked in an abbreviated set of armor, carrying his ridiculously oversize sword on one shoulder, Mifune crying over a baby, and the incomparable scene of his embarassment that turns to rage when Mifune accuses the samurai of creating the farmer's condition.<br /><br />Toshiro Mifune represents the very spirit of desire...the need to prove one's self: Mifune's got the animal sexuality, the physical response to emotional situations, the expressive face, the humorous and varied vocalisms (his drunken burblings as the last \\"samurai\\" to audition, are nothing short of hilarious, and his \\"fish singing\\" is eerie and funny, too...also the grunted \\"eh?\\" that he often uses to show confusion, and the \\"heh\\" of disgust..such wonderful sounds, and so expressive!) Mifune's acting is wild and alive, even more than 50 years after the film's original release.<br /><br />Fumio Hayasaka's music is surprising and perfect, creating humor, or a counterpoint to the action, or deepening our sympathy and understanding of the characters.<br /><br />The filmography is ground-breaking:<br />the multiple cameras, slow-motion and attention to light and composition make each frame worthy of an 8X10 glossy.  How can individual moments of such beauty be sustained throughout the movement of the film? It is an astonishing feat. And, best of all, no image degenerates into interior design or vacuous prettiness...everything forwards the movement of the cinematic experience. When  the film ends, we feel as if we have lived it!<br /><br />It is with great respect and humility that I offer my thanks to the memory of Mr. Kurosawa. His great work leads us to treasure humanity and its struggles, to have compassion, to try to make good choices, to be socially and morally responsible, to embrace life.naked in an abbreviated set of armor, carrying his ridiculously oversize sword on one shoulder, Mifune crying over a baby, and the incomparable scene of his embarassment that turns to rage when Mifune accuses the samurai of creating the farmer's condition.

0312330529|4.0|Leo Tolstoy meets James Hadley Chase in this tale about love, life, crime and adventure. This is a man who has seen much of life. He has loved much, and suffered much. <br /> <br />Read it if you just want to be entertained. Read it if you want to learn about life. But do read it!
B0001WTUH6|5.0|I really liked this movie...Yeah yeah sure there was some FX effects takes from Matrix; however, what movie doesn't take from another.  I mean think about it..There are thousands of movies out there that have been rewritten because of the FX capabilities that we have today versus when it was done.  So let's get off this movie stole something from some other movie because hey it's done more than you ever know!! <br /> <br />Now as for the movie, I thought it was great.  I am such a collector of movies and have seen many movies about Vampires.  Personally I think they did an awesome job. <br /> <br />To me Selene is an awesome character and personally I liked her better than Trinity.  Selene wanted to do what was best for the convenant; however, the leader Kraven had other plans and lied about killing the lycan leader Lucian just so he could control the vampires and him and Lucian could create this super power.  Selene realized that Kraven was lying and went to find answers. What she didn't realize was that she was gonna find Michael who turned out to be someone she would protect, then care for him, and may even fall in love with him.   <br /> <br />If you can remember back to the beginning Viktor's own daughter was in love with a Lycan (Lucian) and would have created the super power then; however, Viktor even admits that he couldn't allow this to happen because he himself would no longer be in power and would be hunted instead and that was his biggest fear was having the vampires lose power.   <br /> <br />As for costumes I have to agree with Kristofer Kalkofen, Vampires and Werewolves are from Medival times.  Have you seen Van Halsing (sp) yet?  OMG they are wearing gothic clothing too.  Who would have ever thought!! Come on now.  If you think about it Vampires are dead..Why would they prance around in Hot Pink outfits?  Some people see immortality as a curse rather than a gift so you don't see cheery clothing in cases like that.  You would find people in dark colors or a \\"gothic\\" style. <br /> <br />Personally I can't wait to see the sequal because it will be interesting to see if Michael will stand up for Selene after she stood up for him or will he end up hunting her out and killing her.

It's a great story but the film is even better. I have watched it so many times I know all the words and all the words to the songs by heart. I sopose you would if you owned the dvd, the makings, behind the sceens and the c.d. like I do! <br />     Paris
1400031354|5.0|Three cheers for Alexander McCall Smith!  For he has written a gentle humorous book that brings us face-to-face with the dignity, strength and courage of the Botswanan people--- and by extension the human race.  But never fear, dear cynics, Smith loves Botswana, but it IS love, not infatuation.  The Botswana of TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE, while peopled with exemplary individuals, is plagued by the usual human amalgam of crime, poverty, disease and injustice.    In TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE, the second, I believe, of the series, we become further acquainted with Mma Precious Ramotswe, the owner of a detective agency in Gabarone, Botswana.  The reader follows her through the ups and downs and conundrums of her personal and professional life.  A missing child, a grieving mother, a young employee, a dishonest maid, a beloved fiancee and two orphaned children are some of the key characters in this African tale.  I very heartily recommend this book to those readers who like a gentle mystery.  Read it and Botswana will become more than a place on a map.  Read it and you will smile.
B0000X61UU|5.0|I am so relieved that this workout is finally on DVD. I have been saving my old VCR to play this workout video and hoping that eventually it would be released on DVD. My prayers have been answered. I can now get rid of my noisy VCR and put my &quot;Next Challenge&quot; video to rest. This workout gives me the best toned abs, thighs, arms and shoulders. You do not have to learn any dance steps or difficult routines. I try to do the workout at least 4 times a week. I just turned 47 and thanks to this workout I have a hard body. I have been doing the workout since 1995. My sister told me about the video. When I went to visit I tried it. I was hooked. You do ache on your first few times doing the workout. It is worth it when you see the results.
B00005JNJ7|1.0|The main problem with this witless mess is that the gags are stale out of the bag.  Most of this material, in fact, was old when it was used in Hot Shots part II.  However, what is most offensive was how it lets Neoconservatives completely off the hook.  The inept World Police take all their orders from a computer, rather than a venal Bush-like weasel.  In fact, Kim Il doesn't come off half as evil as the Hollywood celebrities; who are guilty of having opinions.  For this the filmmakers blow their heads off.  Cute.  This film has no audience because it jumps into an issue in which real lives are being lost, and plays the whole situation for cheap nihilistic laughs.
B0002IQHY8|4.0|I almost didn't buy this CD because of the host of negative reviews posted here. I'm glad I took a chance and didn't listen to a bunch of negative people. <br /> <br />I teach computer hardware maintenance to adults. My instructor station has a nice sound system. I bought the CD, and one day during lab time popped it in the \\"coffee cup holder\\". A couple of the younger students in the lab room stopped their work for a moment and asked me \\"What's that?\\"  I answered \\"Alan parsons\\" and they asked \\"WHO?\\"  I then told them all about Alan Parsons---and they were interested in learning more.  They said \\"He rocks\\". <br /> <br />This story reveals what's possibly \\"wrong\\" with a bunch of you who gave this CD a negative review.  First---you have forgotten AP's roots, while he has re-discovered his roots. Secondly, you aren't willing to take chances or move on to new things (or go home again).  AP has written an album that goes back to the style of \\"I Robot\\" and \\"Tales of Mystery\\", possibly his best two albums. <br /> <br />I have a dear friend who gave up on AP years ago. He has told people for years how AP \\"sold out\\", and how for years AP albums have been \\"pop\\". This album will probably please him. I have told you how it appeals to the younger crowd in my classroom. <br /> <br />BTW, one negative reviewer asked \\"What's with the dog at the end\\"? Just a fun theory: it could be an homage to the end of \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\". At the end of that album (it is said) the Beatles included a note or sound that would cause dogs to start barking when they heard it.  Remember how AP started out and where he worked. <br /> <br />So, if you liked EARLY Alan Parsons, this album will please you more than the more recent softer sounding, pop albums. Be sure to listen to it with headphones on so you can catch every little nuance, including John Cleese. <br /> <br />The one negative of this album is that it's just too short, only nine tracks.
B000002KB8|4.0|Black Sabbath's self-titled debut from 1970 is often called the birth of heavy metal. One look at the witchy looking lady on the cover, and you know the flower power 1960s are over.<br /><br />The title track brings you right into the mood, with sounds of rain and bells, then that dirge-like slow guitar riff and heavy rhythm section. Ozzy's wonderful emoting vocals \\"oh god please help me...\\" make this a burner, that really picks up speed at the end with some fine jamming.<br /><br />Next is The Wizard, with some fine harmonica by the Ozman, plus excellent drumming by Bill Ward. One feature about this debut is that there's a lot more \\"roll\\" with the \\"rock\\" for an almost blues feel, but it's definitely heavy rock.<br /><br />Track 3 is the combination of \\"Wasp-Behind the Wall of Sleep-Bassically - NIB.\\" Some great guitar theatrics and riffing here by Tony Iommi, and standout drumming. Bassically is Geezer Butler's bass solo-noodling with one of the earliest solo rock bass pieces around. I love at the end where you can actually hear the volume being turned up, which then starts the distorted intro to NIB. This is the song that probably got parents scared, and is one of the standout tracks on the disc.<br /><br />Wicked World is an underrated little rocker with a cool guitar riff, jamming bass line and more excellent drumming. This tune could be called metal-swing, but quickly gives way to a meatier lyric portion, and one of Ozzy's better vocal performances on the disk.<br /><br />Track 5 is another medley, with \\"A Bit of Finger-Sleeping Village-Warning. combined for some serious jamming. This is the Tony Iommi showcase, with riffs galore and lots of overdubbed and looped solos. Butler and Ward hold their own in the rhythm section department.<br /><br />This is a great foreshadowing of what the band would later produce. A seminal piece of metal.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Just a word of advice to Rogue Pictures, the company that is releasing this amazing romantic comedy with Zombies. Keep the tagline the way it was when Working Title, and Studio Canal released it! It gets me sooooo mad when studios have to dumb down British humour for American audiences! \\"A Smash Hit Comedy with Zombies\\"?!?!?!? whats that it should be \\"A Romantic Comedy with Zombies!\\" and the film wasn't even really a smash hit here in the U.S. it was a success overseas in England. I mean come on now would american audiences ever really enjoy an orignal film, NO!! They love cinema classics like Scary Movie 3, or Exorcist: The Beginning!!! Sorry bought the ranting but it just ticks me off! Excellent movie by the way. Great performances by Bill Nighy, Simon Pegg and Kate Ashfield, but hands down Nick Frost steals the show. Job well done lads. If you like this movie you will love the British sitcom Spaced also written by Simon Pegg!!
0393317552|2.0|Quack science of the most transparent type.  This is a planet of almost infinitely variable environment.  It is possible to discern significant environmental differences even between areas of close geographical proximity.  Diamond ingeniously exploits this near-constant environmental variety as a means of explaining radical differences in the cultural and technological achievements of the various human ethno-cultural groups.  <br /> <br />The obvious fraudulence of Diamond's methodology lies in its teleological fluidity.  For example, if Diamond were to have explored the Western mountains of Latin America and found only a collection of hill tribes, Diamond would explain that the lack of domesticable mammals, paucity of crops and of ground suitable for agriculture had precluded any kind of advanced civilisation. In fact the Indians who inhabited this region domesticated the lama, terraced the rugged hills and, exploiting only two food staples, corn and potatoes, built a vast empire with sophisticated architecture, a complex bureaucracy and an ingenious means of recording information.  All of this despite dwelling outwith Diamond's \\"environmentally favoured planetary zone\\".  Of course, this is no problem in Diamond's win-win scenario.  Diamond's acolytes simply indulge in a reframing exercise and proclaim that if not for environmental limitations, the Inca would have created an even more sophisticated civilisation. <br /> <br />We see the same trick employed in the case of animal domesticability.  For Diamond if an animal was domesticated it was domesticable.  If an animal wasn't domesticated it was, ipso facto, not domesticable.  Africans failed to domesticate the zebra, therefore the zebra is not domesticable.  Europeans domesticated the horse, therefore, the horse is domesticable.  In support of his argument Diamond quite rightly states that the zebra in its present condition has been found to be untameable.  Diamond neglects to acknowledge, however, that the primative Eurasian horse was equally untamable.  The horse in Eurasia was first herded as a food supply; it took thousands of years of human selective manipulation to create the modern horse.  All sorts of unlikely animals have proven to be, to a greater or lesser degree, domesticable: the lama, the elephant and the reindeer to name a few.  These animals are conveniently overlooked.  Diamond employs the same one-sided analysis of the exploitability of the flora of the various global biomes.  Anyone reading GG&S would think that Caucasians had stumbled into an eden of fully developed seed crops, cleared farmlands and general year-round abundance.  In fact, post ice-age Europe was a land of vast uncleared forests, unfordable rivers, mountain ranges and long, bitter winters.  Corn and wheat were painstakingly developed into agricultural staples over many millenia by an ingenious population.  Had this population failed to exploit their environment, however, these negatives could easily be invoked in support of Diamond's environmentalist theory, thus scoring another victory for environmental absolutism.  Diamond's stipulations for assessing environmental origin resemble the medieval test for witchcraft.  Throw the accused into a lake. If she drowns she is innocent.  If she survives she is a witch and must be killed.  Either way you die. <br /> <br />Even if you accept Diamond's theory that Eurasians supposedly favourable environment gave them the stability from which to develop higher cultures, it does not sufficently explain why sub-Saharan Africa failed to develop such fundamentals as the wheel or a system of writing.  Why no ox-drawn carts in Africa?  <br /> <br />Diamond postulates an army of rhino-mounted Africans invading central Europe and then invokes his indomesticablity clause to explain the impossibility of this scenario.  How does he explain the actual invasion of Europe by Africans from Carthage mounted on elephants?  Of course!  Elephants are domesticable!  Or at least they are a bit; just domesticable enough, in fact, not to upset Diamond's theory. How convenient!  <br /> <br />GG&S is peppered with much peripheral nonsense.  Diamond, supposedly a believer in the equality of races, proclaims that the tribespeople of New Guinea are the \\"most intelligent people on Earth\\" because they manage to survive in one of the most hostile environments on Earth.  It would be obvious to anyone less blinded by his own dogma that the skills necessary for survival in a jungle environment would be acuity of vision and hearing, fast reactions, stamina and fleetnes of foot.  I don't think that any of these attributes would feature on a university entrance exam.   <br /> <br />So it goes on.  It is difficult to see Mr Diamond's opus as anything more than a vast example of post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, simple elegant and wrong.  If human beings are moulded by environment it is equally true that human beings mould their environments.  Extreme environmentalist positions are at best unhelpful and at worst deceitful. <br />  <br /> <br />           <br /> <br />
B00000AFFF|5.0|A lot of people don't like this CD.  but remember this, Elvis Costello does not do things to make his fans happy.. it is my opinion that elvis does things that interest HIM.. that make him grow as a musician.  I personally like the adventure.<br /><br />It is true, as those who detract point out, that some of his CD's don't sound nothing like each other.  That can either be a beauty of his releases or the curse.. depending on what you are in for as a listener.<br /><br />Frank Zappa used to treat his fans the same way.  He would release a rock record, then a musical (Thing Fish) then release material he wrote for the London Symphony Orchestra... FZ did what he liked, recorded for the sake of MUSIC.<br /><br />This recording of moody, soulful, old school crooner like music, is very good to listen to.  It is done perfectly.  I am not really a big fan of non rock music .. but music that is written well translates to any genre.<br /><br />This is one of those recordings, have fun listening.
6305320802|5.0|OK, so OKLAHOMA doesn't have the book (i.e., story) that many other great musicals have, and perhaps it lacks the drama of WEST SIDE STORY or MY FAIR LADY or even SOUTH PACIFIC or THE SOUND OF MUSIC, but few if any musicals ever have had as many brilliant songs.  While most musicals, even very great musicals, have at most two or three truly great songs that are sandwiched among a host of lesser numbers.  This musical, however, has seven or eight songs, and the lesser songs are far above the average for filler in such productions.  In fact, I'm not sure that any single musical has had a larger number of excellent songs.  THE SOUND OF MUSIC has perhaps more novelty songs, but it doesn't quite match the diversity of OKLAHOMA.<br /><br />The film has a superb cast, including one of the great film debuts in Hollywood history:  Shirley Jones as Laurey Williams.  Although she made a number of excellent films, I have often thought that few performers were penalized by bad timing as Shirley Jones.  Her debut was in 1955, when the musical was in decline.  If she had been born twenty years earlier, she would surely have been one of the great figures in Hollywood history.  Instead of two or three great musical roles, she would have been in a dozen or more.  She was prettier than Jeannette MacDonald with a less operatic voice, and would unquestionably have made a string of films that was impossible in fifties and sixties.  Instead of only OKLAHOMA, CAROUSEL, and THE MUSIC MAN, she would certainly have added a host of great musical roles to her resume.  The rest of the cast is also quite good.  Tragically, while this was the beginning of Shirley Jones's career, it was close to the end of Gordon MacRae's star career, as his drinking was beginning to affect his reliability, and only a year later during the filming of CAROUSEL his alcoholism grew to  be such an intrusion that he was unable to continue with his career.  Rod Steiger is wonderfully menacing as Jud, and even turns in a surprisingly decent job of dancing in the ballet sequence.  Gloria Grahame is absolutely perfect as Anytime Annie, the girl who can't say no.  It is hard to imagine the film without Charlotte Greenwood as Aunt Eller.  The one odd note in the cast is Eddie Albert as the Persian Ali Hakim.  While he has several good scenes, the fact is that he neither looks nor sounds Iranian.  In fact, the first time I saw the film as a kid, I thought he was \\"Parisian,\\" not \\"Persian.\\"  His accent definitely sounds more French than Persian.<br /><br />My only complaint with the film is that the story is a bit on the slim side.  It is more or less an attempt to build an epic on a girl's agreeing to accompany the wrong guy to a box social, with a wedding tacked onto the end.  Mainly what happens in the film is a succession of great songs.  Actually, I have a second complaint, and it is one that all the people I have seen this film with also complain about:  the long ballet number that results from Laurey's drug use.  It interrupts the flow of the film as a whole, isn't terribly interesting to watch, and is slightly disconcerting through having dancers who are clearly not Gordon MacRae or Shirley Jones perform the number (though Rod Steiger does portray Jud in the number).  The rest of the film maintains its appeal through our concerning ourselves with the fate of the characters, but the dance removes the characters from the screen entirely.<br /><br />All in all, however, this remains one of the most entertaining musicals ever made.  It captures Rodgers and Hammerstein at their creative peak as well as one of the most exciting screen debuts of all time.a surprisingly decent job of dancing in the ballet sequence.

B00005JMJG|4.0|I agree that this movie is interesting for that reason. I have not read the report but it is on order. Just saw this movie and was wondering why so few people had philosophical reactions to it. As a love story, I find it rather bland. It touches on some other very important things though.
B0002KVUL6|5.0|This movie is big fun, from the beginning to the end. Don't try to analyze anything, don't read the disappointing reviews. Take a seat and let Stephen Sommers' humor shoot you through the deepest vaults of his imagination. Sure, not everything is new and cliches are used whenever they seem to fit, but that's not what this movie is about. It's the director's tribute to the classics and he obviously had the greatest fun making this dream come true. <br />The Ultimate Edition offers three spectacular classics as an extra.
B00005JMJG|5.0|If you liked this movie I suggest you take a look at a copy of \\"Beyond Therapy\\", the President's Bioethics Council, which discusses the ethical, moral and political implications of such things as potential pharmocological agents to \\"wipe memories\\".
B00004TJFL|1.0|Crap.  I did just watch this.  If only the Patriots had even showed up in Pittsburgh, I would not have felt obligated to channel surf and land on this roasting turkey, so fowl it still had its tail feathers embedded.  But--like watching a train wreck, or a bad blind date ending up in a mud wrestling challenge--I followed this flick to its vacuous, brain-bashing ending.<br /><br />If only I had the presence of mind to walk away to clean the bathroom, or de-lice the dogs.  Or go back to the Patriots-Steelers game.<br /><br />Nope, instead I suffered:  suffered through a moronic plot, a stale and pale reincarnation of slasher/bad-guy Michael Meyers (who wore out his welcome after chasing Jamie Lee Curtis in the first 'Halloween' massacre), screaming munchkins--even watched as an aging Donald Pleasence was gassed up and propped up to limp and rant through another easily forgettable performance.  (Donald?  How many of these sequels have you been in?  Have you used up your 'frequent flyer' miles?)<br /><br />Forget about the characters:  they're as inconsequential as they are unmemorable.  And I've already forgotten the story as I type:  What the heck am I reviewing?  Well, one thing's for sure:  I haven't reviewed anything worth a passing fancy of popcorn flatulence.<br />--D. Mikels
B00000DFRS|5.0|I am a fan of Whitney Houston.  When I purchased this album I didn't feel immediately in love with it.  Over time it reflects another signature moment of this Amazing Talent Woman. There is no female vocalist today can touch Whitney.  The only rare exceptions would be Fantasia, Monica and Mariah Carey, Shanice Wilson, Faith Hill, Faith Evans, Patti Labelle. I mean a vocalist that captures you with there vocals and you can actually cry when you hear them sing a song because the have capture the essence it touches your soul and heart as well.  You can simply listen to  their voice as they sing.  That is simply a God Gifted talent.  Some people have to work on it and develop that ability.   There are not many female vocalist are in this ladies league.   This album reflects a diffrent Whitney and it works for her.  I love all the songs.  It shows her diversity.  She reflects her feelings and she captures it very well with this album.  Some fans might be hestiate to embrace this other Whitney but, if you love her vocals it will grow on you over time.  I love the following songs and why <br />1. It's Not Right But It's Okay  -Glorious   <br />2. Heartbreak Hotel - Faith Evans  -She in these amazing talented ladies turn this song into anthem.  Amazing vocals from Whitney, Faith and Kelly.     <br />3. My Love Is Your Love  - Whitney - amazing vocals   <br />4. When You Believe - Mariah Carey  Signature Whitney it really captures both of these talented ladies to come together in sing amazing song together.   <br />5. If I Told You That  -Attitude Whitney, vocally she present her self well   <br />6. In My Business - Missy Elliott -Attitude Whitney, she delivers fiercely and vocally she captures this song.  You can feel her pain that this is her signature song for this album <br />7. I Learned from the Best -Great Song and Vocally Wonderful   <br />Whitney is Amazing and this album reflects her feelings at the time. I would encourage any fan of hers or someone who is lookingto hear amazing talent to purchase.  This is another side of this Amazing talent woman.   <br />

0060920084|1.0|I didn't like this book at all.  I've been many of the places that Bryson visits in the book.  I grew up in the same part of the country that he comes from.  I hoped that this book would be a funny and light-hearted look at a side of America that I call home.  While it is somewhat humorous, I found that his constant sarcasm and cynisism negated most of the laughs.<br /><br />Plain and simple, he pokes fun at America as a foreigner.  I was hoping for a book that read like a buddy joking with me.  Instead, reading this book is like listening to a girlfriend pointing out all that is wrong with me.
B00005JN4O|5.0|I was lucky enough to catch this at the sneak preview and I am so glad I did.  Now when I write a review for a movie starring Johnny Depp I can hardly say my opinion is unbiased, as I do own 10 movies he's starred in and two posters adorn my walls, but I believe non-fans of him will enjoy the magic of \\"Finding Neverland.\\" <br /> <br />The story of J.M. Barrie and his inspiration for the famous play \\"Peter Pan\\" will pull on your heartstrings and make you see the magic of being a child and the power of imagination. During a chance meeting at a park after a disastrous play the night before, Barrie (Johnny Depp) meets the widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four boys.  They become quick friends because of Barrie's childlike personality and antics.   <br /> <br />The whole movie is very well-casted with both the adults and the children.  Depp gives his usual knockout performance that makes you believe that he truly is J.M. Barrie.  Kate Winslet also shines at Sylvia Davies and plays her role with elegance and truly fits her character.  Still, one of the best stars in the movie is Freddie Highmore who plays Peter, Barrie's inspiration for the boy who never wants to grow up.  He displays his emotions so well and makes a real connection with the audience.  Castmates, Depp and Winslet, were very impressed with his acting talent, and Depp even got Highmore the role of Charlie in the upcoming movie \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\\" Highmore almost steals the show, but Depp and Winslet's performances shine through with their onscreen chemistry and a lot of heart.  The supporting cast featuring Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman is not to be ignored, as they both give great performances as their characters.  Julie Christie plays a perfect sort of `villian' in the film as Sylvia's mother who wants Barrie out of her son's lives and Dustin Hoffman brings comedic light wherever he shows up in the movie as Barrie's play producer. <br /> <br />The story is simplistic, but is told with a lot of charm and a great mixture of humor and emotions that will make you laugh and then, moments later, get teary-eyed.  `Finding Neverland' is a magical ride with great acting and can take you away to your own Neverland.
B0002V7O3I|4.0|Joe Dante, director of such fare as \\"Gremlins,\\" \\"Innerspace,\\" and my personal fave, \\"The Howling,\\" shows his flair for combining sci fi with satire.  River Phoenix and Ethan Hawke exploded on the screen as two geeks who find a way to travel in space.  Actually aliens feed them information via the computer because they are bored and want new playmates.  It seems not only are our kids being babysitted by TV, but alien children are too.  These aliens are manic, like Jim Carrey on sugar and coffee fed to them non-stop.  There are some genuinely funny satire moments, and tributes to old sci fi fare.  Great family movie, with messages that still hold up today.
B000008LOV|5.0|My parents still have the cassette tape of this album and I remember as a little kid just playing it over and over.  My mother tells me when I was really little, I would ask to hear that song \\"I'm So Tired of Baloney\\" (sounds vaguely Wierd Al-ish), by which I meant \\"Being Lonely.\\"  I still think it's one of the greatest albums and I still love listening to it, and I'm only 18.
B0002F7I9Y|1.0|This CD had all the potential in the world when you look at the talent involved. What it amounted to was a hyper-engineered and overly orchestrated collection of songs. What a waste. I wanted to strip away the strings and hear the vocals. All except for 'It Was a Very Good Year', with Willie Nelson. That track should be removed completely - strings, vocals and all.

The only people who buy this BS are those who are obsessed with Dr Dre. Wake up Dr Dre just said Eminem's sound was 'hot' 4 a joke + if u don't know this u are a fool.(Please stop these dumb games + sign someone to your label who has TALENT). <br /> <br />3.) If u like rap music listen to Foxy Brown/LL Cool J. <br /> <br />4.) Eminem's videos are ridiculous as well, he thinks that making music is some kind of joke.
B00009UW0N|5.0|This movie is an American classic, and there is no need for me to review it.  I am reviewing this DVD based on all the technical revisions that were done to this Divimax edition.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I am a home entertainment nut.  I have spent a ton of money on a 57\\" HD(High Definition) TV, THX Certified Surround Sound, and a High Def DVD player(Momitsu). So, I always feel gipped when I am watching an older movie on DVD and it is quite obvious that no effort went into converting it over from VHS to DVD.<br /><br />My girlfriend loves this movie, so when I saw that had been redone with all the goodies(digitally remastered, 5.1 surround, correct anamorphic ratio), I had to buy it and see if there really was a difference. I was blown away! The clarity and crispness is amazing, especially considering the quality of the original format was not so hot.  At one point when Jaime Lee Curtis and the annoying black haired are driving and getting high, the sun sets through the windshield so clearly it's as if I were in the car with them.  I could not believe it.<br /><br />I compared this version with the original DVD version and the differences are so acute that you wonder why you don't see more movie classics being converted in the same manner. I really did not expect to see that much of a difference.<br /><br />On the right system, it will run almost at full High Def (1080i), maybe just a smidge below. In fact, this is one of my showcase movies now when I want to show off my HD picture quality.  It is that amazing.  My hats off to Divimax as they have done an amazing job.<br /><br />Anyone who lilkes this movie, and is a HD nut like myself will love this movie.  It's one of those movies that makes it a little easier to justify the expense of your Home Entertainment system.

It sounded like she was fighting not doing it while she was recording it. It has the most powerful vocals I heard in a while. \\"Beautiful\\" is another one and so is \\"Soar.\\" So, if you don't have it, go get it!!!
B00005JKBC|3.0|I must admit, Tony Scott is one of the greatest action directors the film world has to offer.  He not only has the ability to push his actors, but also create these amazing visuals that transport us deep into the setting of the film.  He has mastered the cinematography of nearly every picture he has done, giving us these beautiful shots of the world that we may never see in our lifetime.  Several of his films enhance my DVD collection like Crimson Tide and True Romance, but sadly Spy Game will not.  While Scott does wonders with the actors, scenes, and camera angles, it is the story that is ultimately flaws this film.  The lack of coherence, consistency, and structure take this Tony Scott film and transform it into just your average Hollywood spy film.  It had the potential to reach new levels, and there were several scenes that I loved, but I just couldn't believe the story.  Let me explain.<br /><br />My biggest issue with this film was the lack of aging from our two main characters.  This film spans a timeframe of about sixteen years, and throughout the course of that time neither Pitt nor Redford age.  Director Scott chose not to use CGI or younger actors for the parts when they were in Vietnam, so as the time progressed in the film, our main actors did not.  This was a huge hurdle to overcome since I wanted to enjoy this film.  I did not see the mission where the discovered the fountain of youth, so I can only assume that this was some bad judgment on Scott's part.  Redford and Pitt should have aged more than what they did in this film allowing us to see the emotion and sheer force behind their eyes.<br /><br />Outside of this point it was your average Hollywood action film.  Large explosions and violence countered with a sneaky Sneakers-esque style subplot overshadowed the plot.  Pitt was nothing more than the muscle of the operation, and Scott gave us nothing to build more upon his character.  I fault the writer of this film.  I believe that the homework was done correctly, just not structured correctly.  Perhaps it was just me, but I had trouble following some of the missions.  I realize they were necessary, and possibly not rocket science, but the scene with Charlotte Rampling made no sense.  Maybe I missed a part that was crucial in some way, but overall it just seemed like there was more jumping and fighting than actual plot.  I felt as if the love interest was randomly placed through the film.  I realize that Pitt was not one to follow simple commands, but I felt early on in this film that he would have the ability to walk away from a woman if needed.  Spy Game suddenly went from smart espionage film to \\"master has to fix newbie's mistake\\".  This felt strange to me because throughout the film Redford continued to speak about having the upper hand, and not straying from the point.  Yet, when Redford was faced to save his friend, he did just that.  Was he learning from his pupil?  If so, it was not very well spelled out and a very weak point.<br /><br />Outside of the story, director Tony Scott gives yet another beautiful film.  The cinematography is outstanding.  I loved the way that he kept us, the audience, in suspense as to what time it was and how much time they had to save Pitt's character.  The black and white flashes followed by the time were inventive and it seemed to work.  It kept me on the edge of my seat.  Scott controlled this film and it was a pleasure to see that.  There is no doubt in my mind that he is the master of the action genre and that more scripts should be coming his way.  I hope they are more inventive than this outing and have at least a bit more meat on their bones.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was an average film.  I am disappointed because there are better than average films that Tony Scott has released, I am ashamed to ask why this film was not one of them.  Pitt was solely used for the purpose of his strength (and to capture the attention of a younger female audience) while Redford was used mainly for his dashing good looks (and to capture the attention of the older female audience).  Once you realize this point than this film will fall into place.  I don't think it deserves more than one viewing, but the cinematography alone was powerful enough to watch once.<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****while Redford was used mainly for his dashing good looks (and to capture the attention of the older female audience).  Once you realize this point than this film will fall into place.  I don't think it deserves more than one viewing, but the cinematography alone was powerful enough to watch once. <br /> <br />Grade: *** out of *****
0671027387|3.0|\\"Deception Point\\" is not an out and out loser but it leaves a lot to be desired nevertheless.  The plot is preposterous, the writing clumsy, and the book's political thread painfully ill-informed.<br /><br />Despite its weaknesses, \\"Deception Point\\" is an exciting tale that often had me on the edge of my seat.  The action sequences in the Arctic and at sea are particularly effective.  Still, this book falls far short of the high standard Brown set in \\"The Da Vnci Code.\\"
6305754969|5.0|While many point out that El Dorado is a remake, I think it is, in fact, better than the first movie it is based on.  First off, no singing or cast based on the need for singers!  This is a REAL, honest-to-God, Western, with a big \\"W\\".  John Wayne and Robert Mitchum really work well together.  You can feel the history behind their friendship and this adds to the conflict, the struggle, they feel, as one has to watch the other recover from crawling into the bottle.  James Caan brings a LOT to the cast, really allowing a way for much of the humor to enter the film.<br /><br />Not much in extras - in fact there is only a trailer.  126 minutes of fun.
B00005AWMF|5.0|If you're a product of the eighties, most likely you've never known a time without the ever prolific, soulful Sade and frankly, who would want to? The Best of Sade is a sixteen track masterpiece featuring some of her best work until 1992. Released in 1994, the album went double platinum in the United States, the United Kingdom and Italy, in addition to going platinum in nine other countries.    With her exotic beauty and captivating voice, Sade manages to cast a spell on any listener; however, I must admit, it's \\"never as good as the first time.\\" Somewhere around 1995, I stumbled across an old cassette tape in my dad's study. As a teenage male, anything that featured a beautiful woman on the cover piqued my interest. I rushed to put the cassette in my stereo and the first thing I heard were the horns and bass of \\"Is It a Crime.\\" Then I hear one of the most beautiful voices say, \\"This may come...this may come as a surprise, but I miss you.\\" I missed her too, yet I didn't even know who she was.    It was Sade's sophomore album, Promise, released ten years earlier in 1985, which quickly catapulted her to top of my list of favorite singers. I thought to myself, \\"Why hadn't I heard this before, or of Sade, for that matter?\\" Perhaps, an even better question at the time would have been, \\"Who is Sade?\\" I wasn't even sure of how to pronounce her name, until my dad came in the room and muttered something along the lines of, \\"Hooked on Sade, huh?\\" And that, I certainly was.    Helen Folasade Adu was born in Ibadan, Nigeria, to an African father and an English mother. Growing up, she'd listen to some of the best soul singers of her time like Ray Charles, Nina Simone and Marvin Gaye - artists who were able to capture an emotion, such as heartache or love, and force that feeling upon all who listened; a skill Sade, herself, naturally possesses.    The effortless \\"Stronger than Pride\\" fuses island beats, jazz and R&B into a timeless classic. Her dynamic handling of \\"Is It a Crime,\\" is what caught my attention. The soft, gentle tone in the beginning is overrun with emotion as Sade pleads for a love lost. \\"Jezebel,\\" with its haunting appeal and vulnerability evident in her voice, forces you to listen and take notice. But, of course, you should be doing that anyway. On \\"No Ordinary Love,\\" Sade's voice oozes sex appeal, making it one of the best love-making songs ever. The lyrics to \\"Cherish the Day,\\" fit perfectly into the deep, sensual musical accompaniment. \\"Pearls,\\" the jewel that closes this collection, is so full of emotion, I cried the first time I heard it.    I'm not entirely sure how one would clasify Sade; so many influences are evident in her music. However, this is definitely a chill-out album to relax with your loved one and \\"cherish the day.\\"
0060512806|4.0|Looking at Cryptonomicon, my second thought was - They call this mammoth a thriller? Surely, a thriller, which should be a tight-written book by the definition, couldn't be this BIG?? (The first thought, if you are interested, was 'Wow!', because such a big book written by one person impressed me - that was before I laid my eyes on 'Wheel of Time', but I digress). <br /> <br />Well, to be honest, it is NOT a thriller. Now, I'm not meaning it as a drawback, I just want to set the record straight. Yes, there are men with guns and spies and submarines and codes and a very big secret, buried for 50 years, but they are not the point of this book. The point is people ... and codes. <br /> <br />Cryptonomicon weaves two tales - one happening during WWII, another in modern day. They are dealing with several generations of Waterhouse and Shaftoe families (those families later featured in Baroque Cycle, which takes place in earlier centuries). I don't want to give you any of the plot, part lybecause it takes around a hundred pages to get, where it is going, and partly because they are a fun 100 pages! <br /> <br />Stephenson is at the top of his game in this book. He knows, where his plot is going (there are some loose ends, but nothing like the ending of 'Diamond Age'), and he keeps his ramblings in check and manages to make them interesting and understandable. I mean, any author, who can write about the way the visual signal is produced in the computer monitor, and keep non-technical people reading two pages of this description with interest deserves admiration.  <br /> <br />After 'Diamond Age', in which Stephenson so much loved his world, that he forgot the story, this book makes up for all the mistakes. Stephenson was allways good on style, but here it is never put in front of the story itself. <br /> <br />The main achievement is that the book is allways fun to read. Even when dealing with electrons. And as a bonus there is a wonderfull mathemetical formula of horniness. Can you say this about any other book?
B0001AP12G|5.0|I must admit that I was not much of a fan when I first heard Slow Jams. I thought Kanye was just another black man reducing women to sexual items. However, he has really impressed me with the rest of this album.<br /><br />Like Jay Z, Kanye has an album full of powerful, creatively written lyrics that make you pay attention to every word. I hate words that are put together just because they rhyme (Chingy!) but Kanye is really saying a lot in almost every song.<br /><br />The majority of the record allows me to forgive and enjoy songs like The New Workout Plan, Slow Jams, and Breath In Breath Out which are fun songs that talk about nothing at all. In fact, in Breath In Breath Out he mocks himself for talking about this crap.<br /><br />Overall this album has a seemless combination of funny, serious, creative, simple, and deep lyrics and rediculously hot beats that don't feel west coast or east coast.<br /><br />My favorites:<br /><br />We Don't Care- he let's me see where he's coming from<br /><br />Spaceship- another chapter in his interesting history<br /><br />School Spirit- as a college graduate I feel a lot of what he says in this song (\\"Everything I want I got to wait a year, wait a year\\")<br /><br />Jesus Walks- While I can't imagine this song being played in church I feel his message which is, though I am a screw up, Jesus still loves me and wants me and continues to bless me. That sounds like my Jesus!<br /><br />I'm itching for the softmore album.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|JET ROCKS ! But they really suck on the slow ballads. So this is about half a disc. If I had it to do over I would buy only the good cuts off iTunes. You have to decide for yourself. I am still giving it 5 stars though.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|First note that I am reviewing the 2 disc set, which has lots of added features and should definitely be purchased instead of the stripped down version. The feature with director Peter Weir is especially enjoyable. The added features make the extra cost more than worth it. <br /> <br />In regard to the movie: you must see this if you like period pieces, especially those which are faithful to history, and action-dramas, or naval battles. If you are looking for romance or comedy, then watch something else (although at one point Crowe's character does smile at a woman, and there is one good joke). <br /> <br />Unlike most period films, this one is true to the historical context. Its portrayal of the harshness of life at sea, the privation and harsh discipline, the sense of duty and manhood lost to much of our culture, are authentic. My favorite line in the movie is where Crowe/Aubrey rallies his men before the final battle, and makes a point to remind them, \\"this ship is England.\\" Given the disturbingly large number of Americans disturbed by the relatively small number of casualties we have suffered in Iraq so far, there is much we have lost. <br /> <br />There is one historical error. Where Aubrey says that he fought with Lord Nelson at the Nile as a young man, he gives the impression that this was many years before. But based on the starting date given at the beginning of the movie, it was only a couple of years beforehand.  <br /> <br />For those who have read the books, the Aubrey and Maturin characters are preserved fairly well, especially Maturin. Aubrey's is altered a bit more. Both Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany do a fastastic job with their roles overall.
B0002234LS|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I enjoyed Johnny Depp's portrayal of Mort.  He got Mort's interdivorce lazyness down pretty good, though his mood wasn't really that comical in the book.  John Shooter's character was done excellently.  Very nice.  The movie went very swiftly and barelled towards the ending, which was somewhat different than in the book.  I won't bore you with the petty details, but I liked how he brought the story full circle in the end, by giving it that perfect ending.  If there were parts, little parts, people didn't fully get, read \\"Secret Window, Secret Garden\\" by Stephen King.  But for now, this is by far one of the better movies based off of a Stephen King movie.
B00000720W|4.0|Silvester Ansfang is a nice, ominous little intro that prepares us for the Mayhem that is about to follow. With Deathcrush it is business as usual at the black metal office. Euronymous' guitars crunch bone and sinew and Manheim punches away at anything and everything, whereas Maniac screams at passing ghosts and ghouls. The unceremonious CG and Necrolust establish themselves on the listener with a simple, decorous black metal elegance. All tracks seem to have several degrees of freedom within an over-determined arch of musical emotion and seem to have come together in the given form only by sheer chance. Caution: Don't expect to be enthralled,Deathcrush is not intended to entertain. It is meant to involve. Mayhem are masters of the art of music not because they intentionally create chaos, that is too nihilistic, nor because they want to impress you with any virtuoso performances, but because they accept the ground rules of chaos and create from it something resembling beautiful order. But they only go half the way. And this is where you come in...
B0002IU988|5.0|Alter Bridge is a great band that plays great music. Tremonti totally rocks...his guitar riffs and solos are amazing, it goes so well with Kennedy's voice and so does the drums and bass. TRUE MUSIC! If you are looking for an album this one should be the first on your list. A MUST-HAVE!! Their ability to write, record, and perform this stuff is insane! <br />This is what I call true music.....GO GET IT!! <br /> <br />
0671027387|3.0|The book is an average read; the accidents that befall the characters are predictable and the way they escape are too predictable. What mentions note is how a powerful organization can be manipulated by the powerful few. Makes us want to have more checks and balances in society so that power is not misused.
B0002KVUKW|3.0|If you read all the reviews for Van helsing, you actually learn that this was an ok film. Yes is the first film to have dracula frankeinstein and werewolves. It is a very good film, but not the type you would like to see over and over again. Van Helsing has great action sequences, great special effects except for the plot. The plot is not entirely bad but it could have used a little more spice. The plot can get very dull. This actuallly not a scary movie at all and you wonder why its rated pg 13. The way they put all the monsters in the same movie is interesting to see and you will like it. This is a good film and should not be missed. But just don't buy it its not worth it!
B00006BTCA|5.0|Atmoshperic.  If any word could be used to describe Interpol that would be it.  Turn on the Bright Lights opens up with the breathtaking \\"untitled\\" and then segues directly into \\"Obstacle 1\\" which further molds the dark mood brought about by \\"untitled\\".  \\"Obstacle 1\\" is followed by \\"NYC\\" which is where is where the album gains its title.  Track four is \\"PDA\\", one of the albums faster songs, in which Paul Banks declares \\"we have 200 couches where you can sleep tonight\\".  \\"Say Hello to the Angels\\" is the only song on the album where Interpol sounds like anyone other than themselves.  \\"Hands Away\\" builds slowly, and constantly asks: \\"oh, what happened?\\"  \\"Obstacle 2\\" showcases Interpol at thier most upbeat (well, on this album at least).  \\"Stella was a diver and she was always down'\\" brings about the dark theatrics that take up a major part of Interpols' second album, \\"Antics\\".  Interpol trades lyrics for song structure on \\"Roland\\", and \\"The New\\" is one of the most beautiful tracks they've recorded.  \\"Leif Erikson\\" ends Turn on the Bright Lights in a fashion that leaves one wanting more, but with a sense of being full.
0312995423|2.0|Reading this story I realise that I know absolutely nothing about computers beyond the kindergarten stage. If you are deeply into the world and language of computers, you will probably enjoy it more than I did. A top secret US intelligence agency has perfected a super duper, fail-safe code breaking machine which has nevertheless been infiltrated by spies. For most of the book, I had only the barest comprehension of the computer speak and what it was supposed to be doing. If you're not well into the computer business, give this book a miss.
B00005MP58|4.0|I love the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice and couldn't wait to get my copy of the 'Special Edition' with the making of / behind the scenes.<br /><br />I was disappointed when the only actor which is interviewed is Mrs Bennett and with only a few bits here and there of Mr Darcy and other characters I was left feeling like I had wasted my money. It was mainly talking by the producer and writer about the pre-production (which you can read about in the book). I felt there should have been a lot more than what I got.<br /><br />The colour also looks a bit...strange - washed out and the like, unlike the video version which had much stronger period colours. The sound is a bit muffled and not as good as the video version as well which was disappointing.<br /><br />Having written that, the quality is good for the series. Colin Firth is dreamy as Mr Darcy and Jennifer Ehle is great as Elizabeth. I recommend this no question, you will never get sick of watching it :-)
B0002XVQNU|3.0|Look, I understand that the movie is not the world's finest. Some of the scenes may make you raise an eyebrow with that famed \\"Huh?\\" expression spreading across your face. Other scenes may, indeed, actually cause you to roll your eyes a bit.<br /><br />But, in all seriousness, it's a decent movie for what it is attempting to accomplish: a slightly dark take on the comic-book story of Daredevil and Elektra, with Bullseye and the Kingpin as the major villains.<br /><br />We have action-packed fight scenes that, while some may argue there is a bit too much wire-work in some spots, manage not to go too far beyond the bounds of super-hero physics. Anyone complaining that it goes to far? I point you to some of the jumps Daredevil makes in the comics, or his recent epic battle against 100 drugged-up yakuza in a recent Brian Michael Bendis-penned issue.<br /><br />This release (referring to the Director's Cut) promises to fill in a few holes from the movie, add an extra layer of depth with the addition of a small sub-plot, and extend one or two action scenes to give them a more \\"whole\\" feeling. It wasn't absolutely necessary to enjoy the movie, but I feel it'll likely please a few more people.<br /><br />All in all? A good effort, and a worthy addition to any action-movie or comic-book fan that can get past the Affleck-hate or detail-obsession... but not a movie classic.
B000002U6E|5.0|My stars all go to \\"Return to Innocence\\" which contains a sample of chanting from aboriginals of Taiwan, I can't say more since the singers passed away years ago, the heavenly voice therefore returned to where it belongs.
B00005JNJ7|4.0|MOVIE:  Trey Parker and Matt Stone create a genre within themselves and this is their latest addition.  What this movie basically is, is a spoof of big budget action movies and politics.  The whole movie is laugh out loud.  Whether it was the rebellious actors of the Film Actors Guild (...) teaming with Kim Jong Il or the many spoofs put on action movies. There is an entire montage scene and with it is a song that describes what a montage really is. An entire song is dedicated to Michael Bay and how he screwed up with Pearl Harbor. Then there is puppet sex, oh so hilarious puppet sex. The movie feels a lot like South Park, but it's different enough to hold on its own. Every joke in this movie is laugh out loud funny. I only recount having one or two moments to catch my breath. Every time Team America comes flying out in full force, the Team America theme song plays along, \\"Team America, F&%K YEAH!\\" Then there's the aspect that they actually got Harry Gregson-Williams to do the score of the movie so it actually sounded like an over-produced action movie. The political references come flying in one after another, and so do the movie references.  Every action movie cliche is addressed here and will have you laughing.  What really makes it funny is the stiff limited movement these puppets have. When the main character fights Samuel L. Jackson it's the funniest thing I have ever seen. The shootouts are hilarious and so is Kim Jong Il who has a solo of singing \\"Lonely, I'm So Lonely\\".  Absolutely hilarious, is how they make fun of America's \\"intelligence\\", which is depicted in the movie as a computer that sounds like a teenage stoner.  \\"There's no I in Team America\\" says the head of operations, (long pause), \\"Umm, yeah there is\\", says intelligence.  The list goes on and on of what they make fun of, including the depiction of various races and origins like Muslims, Asians, and Hispanics. The movie is a mess, the jokes come flying in hard and fast, it's rude, it's crude, it's one of the funniest things I have ever seen.<br /><br />ACTING: One of the movie's main continuing joke is actors, so naturally they use puppets instead. Most of the voices are done by Matt and Trey, a lot you will recognize from South Park, but still oh so painfully funny.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: This is one of the most entertaining movies ever made. If you think of this as just plain potty humor you are mistaken. So many political aspects of our world are attacked within the spoofs and satire, same goes for Hollywood. Very original and smart is what this movie is under all the outrageous stunts and scenes. You will be dead tired after this movie from laughing so much, and you will be laughing at it for quite some time after you walk out of the theater.

0440242576|5.0|I have never read John Grisham before, but I found it interesting that he would write a comical, holiday book. It suits him. Grisham is a brilliant writer, and he writes characters that are so real, you instantly can picture someone you know, or know of, in the part. They are real. So is this book. With Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis starring in the lead roles in the upcoming movie, I could only picture them. If people find it obvious and too normal, then that's the point. This is life. The story centers on Luther and Nora Krank, a middle aged couple that are sending their only child, 23 year old graduate student Blair, off to Peru to work with the Peace Corps. With the holidays coming, and Luther realizing that they spent $6,100 on Christmas last year, he devises a plan. With Blair gone, he suggests they skip Christmas this year, and by saving that money, treat themselves to a 10 day cruise to the Caribbean. No tree, no lights, no decorations, no cards, no annual party, no nothing. With the close knit neighborhood that embraces the festivities with carolers, parades, and an amazing light display, and police officers and firefighters collecting donations for charity, the Kranks learn that foregoing the holiday is tougher than they thought. Then Blair calls, and everything is thrown into a tailspin. I won't say more. Grisham has a keen sense of detail for the spirit of the season, and all the chaos and craziness that goes with it. He tackles the hectiness of it by showing off all the rushing to and fro, and gift buying, and the lunacy of it all. What kind of bothered me was the community's reaction to their plans. It was like they commited a crime. I love Christmas, and can't do without it, but I can see Luther's point. Why can't anyone see the logic behind it?. The book is screamingly funny, because it all comes from truth. Some of it might seem like it was written to up the humor and wackiness of it all, but so what?. The ending is something else. Some people here have had problems with the overdone ending. So?. This is a story. It's just a book. The ending is warm and gives that nice feeling that in this day and time, is most welcome to see. Or read. Or hear about. The book is filled with some colorful characters. Most of them the neighbors. Vic Frohmeyer, the neighborhood nazi, who takes care of everything. And there are more. They are all interesting and vivid, because Grisham writes each character out. They are fully developed and written, and have their own personality and traits. They can be anybody. The book may not be in the classic category with stories like \\"A Christmas Carol\\", or any number of favorite holiday films, but it is genuinely charming, witty, and full of humanity, that it should develop a following that will place it in the yearly holiday fun. John Grisham, this may not be the norm of what you write, but I found it to be refrshingly real, honest, and above all, entertaining. You could read it all in one day if you wanted too, but why not stretch it out to prolong the fun?. Can't wait for the movie. Merry Christmas!.have had problems with the overdone ending. So?.

B00003CXDV|5.0|I've seen other reviewers summarize the plot, or tell you that you need to have seen Star Trek to enjoy this movie.<br /><br />I won't be doing that.<br /><br />This movie is hilarious, and the only thing that being a Star Trek fan brings to the table is that some of the jokes will have a different meaning for you than they might to someone who has avoided that aspect of pop culture.<br /><br />I know that when I watched it with my mother and father, who only know Star Trek through what's seeped into their awareness over the years, they laughed at pretty much the times one would expect and enjoyed it quite a bit.<br /><br />The movie is more subtle than some people give it credit for, playing on stereotypes that may be based on famous personalities from the various incarnations of Star Trek but have a connection with anyone who's been exposed to the ups and downs of ANY set of t.v. actors through the years. Something it's been hard to avoid in our age of \\"Intimate Portraits\\" and \\"Biography\\" specials.<br /><br />Suffice to say that there is something in this movie for everyone, as the crew of a t.v.-show starship that's been off the air for a while try and save the day for real... the laughs are accessable for everyone from Star Trek geeks (Wil Wheaton says it reminded him of what was great about conventions) to normal folk to people who made fun of Star Trek geeks.<br /><br />You'll laugh, you'll cry... and you'll laugh while watching \\"Roy\\" cry. It's a winner for everyone.

0393307050|5.0|I recieved this book on Friday afternoon and finished it on Sunday morning. Patrick O'Brian's writing is superb. His characters and there relationships held me spellbound. Especially the secret of Dr. Mauratin and Lt. Dillon. Well rounded and exciting reading. I read Captain Blood and Lord Johnny when I was a boy and thought nothing could ever capture my imagination like that again, I was wrong. I cannot wait to finish Post Captain the next book in the series.
B0002SROT0|5.0|From a basement.. IS a great album. Don't listen to Kiwimaddog \\"  Coast to coast- (C) - The only track on the album i think should have been left off. Its not bad for a hard rock song, but this is just not a style Elliott pulls off too well.\\" I think Coast to Coast is an awesome song that Elliott pulled off great.. I mean actually grading songs. The album flows perfectly, every song is good, and it's my opinion that this is Elliott's best album. When you get done listening to it you'll be sing like two or three of the songs over and over untill you can't help but listening to From a basement on the hill again.

B00005NKCM|5.0|Upstairs, Downstairs is the saga of the Bellamy family and their household staff in the early 20th century. Throughout the series their lives, loves, tragedies and triumphs are portrayed. This set of 13 episodes includes the COMPLETE first season as seen in Britain, including some black and white episodes never seen on tv in the US. In the first episode we are introduced to the colorful Sarah (Pauline Collins), in the second (B&amp;W episode) Lady Marjorie has her portrait painted only to discover at the Royal Academy Show that the artist has also painted two half-naked maids in an attic room (possibly Bellamy maids?). In episodes 3 and 4 (B&amp;W) we are introduced to the children, James and Elizabeth Bellamy. Episodes 5 and 6 show us the romance between Elizabeth Bellamy and a German Baron (and it's dark underside), and the pregnancy of the new maid, Mary. More familiar episodes to the US audience come in #7 and #8, Lady Marjorie is spellbound with a young army captain who is friends with her son James, and Emily (the annoying kitchen maid) falls for a neighboring family's footman, with disastrous results. Episodes 9 and 10 have Mrs. Bridges, the cook, behaving in a most improper way and stealing a baby, and the erstwhile Sarah returns with a new plan to improve her social standing. The two penultimate episodes in this set include the further adventures of Sarah the housemaid with a Swedish valet, and the further adventures of the Bellamy's daughter, Elizabeth, with a group of young Socialists. Finally we are left with the now estranged Elizabeth Bellamy and her relationship with a leftist poet, Lawrence Kirbridge--and a great eagerness to own the next 13 episodes, now also available.<br />Upstairs, Downstairs is the classic &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; series, with costumes, drama, comedy, and riveting characters that we take to our hearts. If you are a fan of more recent costume dramas on A&amp;E and PBS, you will very much enjoy this early series which holdsup remarkably well, after nearly two decades. <br>We completed the First Season last night and I'm hooked. The writing is terrific and all the performances are enchanting. My particular favorites are Mr. Hudson, the butler, and Rose, played by the gifted and gorgeous Jean Marsh. <br />The print quality of the videos is excellent overall, but I know that I shall be buying the series again when it comes out on DVD, as I'm sure some jerking of the picture (mostly in the credits, never in the performance itself) and other flaws will be removed as far as possible. <br />The social structures of both the wealthy class and the servant class are jarring, especially to an early 21st-century viewer. We have come quite a long way from that time when a servant must &quot;know his place&quot;. Yet, it wasn't just they who had to know who they were and what place they occupied in the world: in many ways, the wealthy were just as trapped in their positions - if not moreso - than the servants who ran their lives. And make no mistake - the servants DID run things if this series is to be believed.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|I just love lenny kravitz, and would buy any material I can find on the internet. <br /> <br />Have you heard the last news :  <br />Alicia Keys and rock star Lenny Kravitz are rumoured to be dating. <br /> <br />The pair dined at a New York restaurant and then headed to a nearby nightspot. <br /> <br />You can read more on &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">Lenny Kravitz Fan site&lt;/a>
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I just read through all of the reviews for this DVD, and one thing is glaringly obvious - no one has actually seen/heard the thing!  I have an advance copy, and it's funny to hear people pontificating about something they have never seen - I particularly enjoyed comments like \\"Phil Collins doesn't perform 'Against All Odds' on this DVD\\".  Hmm.  I rather enjoyed the performance that I just watched.   <br />Folks, it's a 20-year-old television broadcast that they've remastered in beautiful surround sound that shows off all of the performances, warts and all, and it sounds AMAZING.  Branford Marsalis' haunting soprano sax rings through like a plaintive siren in the night.  Yes, there are some glitches, and some out of tune harmonies - the Beach Boys segment alone has some that are cringe-worthy.  But again, that segment illustrates the beauty of the set - there they are, Brian up with the rest, Carl singing his heart out, Mike Love as nonplussed as can be, all doing it for a wonderful cause.  <br />Each of the 4 DVDs is over 2 hours in length.  That's a lot of music.  Yes, some performances were left off.  But please wait and whine until after you've actually had a chance to hear/see what a remarkable job these folks did with this set.
B00005JMAH|1.0|Why give a great/good movie such a low rating?  <br />Simple. Part of the reason for me ordering this DVD through Amazon was the \\"exclusive screensaver only available if you order here\\". Was it possibly just something that would be available on the DVD? Marauders Map screensaver? Sounds exciting. Maybe its similar to the images we see in the closing credits of Azkaban.  <br />What is was THREE images for the eyetide screen saver, which had to be downloaded separately. Three still images of the Marauders map, not even the map open, no movement.  <br />Very disappointed. It's already in my recycle bin.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|You can hear Clapton struggling for authenticity on this one. Listen to \\"Kind Hearted Woman Blues\\" and you'll wince when Clapton goes for that deep throated blues bass vocal. Sure there are worthy efforts like \\"Hellhound on my Trail,\\" where Clapton seems to be really feeling it, but ultimately this doesn't have anything but competence going for it.Everything here is mannered and professionally presented; it would have been so much better if Clapton just let it rip. This really adds nothing to the legacy of Clapton or Johnson.
0393035158|1.0|The basic essential truth of Harris' disasterously predictable piece is that the vast majority of the ideas he expresses have largely been penned before, with better insight, by better writers.  My best analysis of the rational behind this book is that Harris was either attempting to simplify a series of abstract concepts for a mainstream, semi-educated audience, or he's simply not a talented critical thinker.   <br />In the same instance, while I agree with Harris' general concept of the horrible effects religion has had on the world, his is certainly not the perspective I would consider recommended reading. Hense, it would be quite a disappointment if the public latched onto this book with the same in-depth analysis one would (and should) afford the more academic sources of this brand of philosophy.   <br />Don't embarrass yourself by picking this one up. Stick with Nietsche instead...
B00005JMXX|2.0|There really isn't much to say about this movie. It tries to make a  <br />statement about the environment and how we need to change our ways.   <br />That's true, but it's still not a great movie. Good special effects but by the time all is said and done, it's rather dull. I guess the director or writer felt there's only much you can do with  <br />storms they decided to throw some hungry attack wolves for excitement.  <br /> <br />The two stars is for special effects.  <br /> <br />Side Point: Doesn't the actor who plays Denis Quaid's son look like Woody from Toy Story?

And, last but not least, the people who bought their movie from amazon should have gotten off their lazy (explicative)'s and went to best-buy and got it for $9.99.
B00005JMJG|5.0|With quirky films like Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman has identified himself as a modern-day genius, bending reality to a point where fiction truly is stranger than truth.  His latest project, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, is a much more tender and introspective film, exploring the concepts of memory and lost love. <br /> <br />Jim Carrey, in his best role yet, plays Joel Barish, a quiet, unassuming man who falls in--and out--of love with the quirky Clementine (Kate Winslet), a high-energy, moody girl that couldn't be more his polar opposite.  Following their breakup, Clementine elects to have her memories of him selectively erased from her mind at a place that specializes in memory erasure. <br /> <br />Not to be outdone, Joel decides to level the playing field.  What follows is a sometimes confusing and often disorienting exploration of Joel's memories of Clementine.  Much like our own memory, the details are subject to change, and follow no chronological order.  The good times, however scarce, seem to outweigh the bad.  And sometimes the desires of the present don't seem to equate with the dreams of the past. <br /> <br />To say more about the plot would be difficult... and improper.  Suffice it to say that this movie works because Joel's walk down memory lane is a familiar stroll for us all.  Stylistically, the film is an assault on the senses, with constant and sometimes subtle visual effects enhancing the alternate reality of events remembered.  The film is funny at times, but more often, it is achingly tender, and other times pathetically desperate.  There is a brilliant subtext of emotion woven into the story, the cinematography, and the performances. <br /> <br />With lesser actors at the helm, Eternal Sunshine could have quickly degraded into a simple film experiment, but Carrey and Winslet truly elevate this movie beyond its impeccable style, creating honest characters that ground the film.  As we look in on their first meeting, as well as their last, it's easy to forget we're just watching two actors. <br /> <br />Eternal Sunshine was pegged by the powers that be as a romantic comedy, probably to make it more palatable to the moviegoing public.  This is doing the film a disservice.  Anyone expecting a mindless and lighthearted diversion, complete with the predictable happy ending, will likely be a little put off by this film.   <br /> <br />Eternal Sunshine cannot really be described in conventional terms, which is a great deal of the magic of Charlie Kaufman films.  It is tender, evocative, and ultimately profoundly moving.  Simply put, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of the finest films of the past year.
B000003TA4|4.0|I was browsing around for info on Nevermind when I came across this comment page.  I was a junior in high school when this album came out, and it blew me away.  I am certain there have been and will be more tallented musicians than Cobain.  Certainly many have proven to be more mentally stable.  However, this album just plain rocks.  If you want to drive down the road, screaming lyrics and listening to raging guitar licks after a long, frustrating day of work, this album suits the purpose as well as any.  Plus, while I am blowing off steam, Kurt's sense of the ironic never fails to make me laugh.  I just hope his kid can survive Courtney Love.
0385335482|4.0|I recently returned from my first trip to the UK and I purchased this book at the airport for the flight home.  It is hilarious.  The letters from the creditors are a great touch.  I think part of my enjoyment came from just having been in the same shops that she is talking about.  Just reading her rationalizations for her purchases had me laughing.  This is a light easy read.  I am in the middle on the 2nd book...it too is terrific.
0694003611|5.0|Read this to your young children. It's an absolutely perfectly simple book. No extra fluff....just a great read for you and your children. I read this every night to my daughter with hush little baby. She has grown to love the moon and is sparked with excitement for nighttime viewings of stars and the moon. Education starts early. Reading is SO important. Take advantage of this classic read. They will remember it for years.
B00005JMXX|2.0|After the special effects, the rest of the movie, like a blizzard, gets bogged down. The world moves slow but incredibly, our heroes walk 40 miles through the worst storm ever to save the day.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird epitomizes all that is valuable to mankind. Through the simple, innocent eyes of children, we see triumph of good over evil played out in a small town. Scout's father, Atticus, told her it is a sin to kill a mockingbird, for they only make music and harm no one. Two innocents, played a role in demonstating this fact: a black man, falsely accused and a mentally ill man by the name of Boo Radley, who does an amazing thing as the subplots unfold, within the major plot. There are several humanistic morals to this story, as Atticus Finch sets an example as a good father and defender of the innocents. To Kill a Mockingbird is not only fascinating reading for all ages, but holds moral lessons that never die for humanity, for all time.
B00013RC9I|2.0|Air created a genius work in Moon Safari, and this quality was evident in their other early albums.  This genius took ethereal synth and gave it an earthy timeless quality.  Their earlier music became a soundtrack for our lives.  One could listen to Moon Safari endlessly, and I was compelled to do so on many occassion. <br /> <br />Air unfortunately abandoned this genius with Talkie Walkie.  This new album instead sounds like a hazy version of modern British rock.  The lyrics (why are they trying to sing themselves) are rigid, repetitive, and mind numbing.  One tires of hearing the album play before it is over. <br /> <br />I hope that Air will use its talents in the future for better purposes.
B0001Z53AQ|2.0|Em went to far on this one. It's too dark and fast. You get exhausted just listenin to it. Every song is about f**cking and pistol whippin', way to repetitive. All the beats are similar except from a few. The only enjoyment i got from this album was the comical lyrics from Bizzie. Not worth the time it takes to download it let alone the money to buy it. Trust me!
B00000K31Q|5.0|I absolutley love this movie and I've watched it so much, I know every line! In fact, I used to rent this movie so much at the local movie rental store, the owner gave me the promotional poster when he was done hanging it in the window! I also recommend buying the soundtrack because all of the songs from the movie are amazing and this CD is packed with the great music.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|I was in Dallas June 4-6 2004.  The concert on the sixth of june was so awsome.  I have seen the list of songs on this dvd and only wish songs like Neil Schones rendition of Jimis \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" some Steve Vai, and ALL of the \\"Jam Session with Clapton,B B King Buddy Guy and Jimmy Vaughn(who insedently came out of stevies shadow this day) should have been included.  Well there was enough concert in Dallas to make a volume Two and Three, we can always hope anyways.  But the Concert was best Ive ever seen and I am deffenatly buying this and highly recomend you do the samew
0465043550|5.0|First you have to get around Benoit Mandelbrot's style, that being his strong use of the first person.  Overall, this book is sheer brilliance, albeit with some flaws.  As I never got the feeling that the author wanted everyone to think that he was right, I will not hold these incongruences against him.  Over all, he takes the reader on a step by step analysis of the way in which financial markets move, and how the patterns that are seen are fractal in nature.  Further, and this is the biggest take away, you cannot profit from a financial market by following trends, just by mitigating risk.  It is in the last point that he breaks a few rules, especially by stating that the current risk models are wrong.  My wish is that more people read his work, and start to incorporate is teaching in financial management.  Perhaps the job of a fund manager is not over.
B0000U5RO4|1.0|I loved Mr.Bean but Johnny English is just not funny.  Even my 8 year old was unimpressed.  My husband a huge fan of British comedy was very disappointed.   <br />Poorly acted and scripted.  I am glad it was a rental. Only received a 1 because the rating system won't allow anything lower.
079073804X|4.0|I am probably not the greatest authority on the genre of horror movies - but this one, while it is certainly one of the best, falls short of the excellent reviews and attention it is given. The theme is interesting - possession is something that has fascinated people throughout the history of human beings - and the movie is filmed pretty well - nothing much to complain about. For some reason I just can't bring myself to give it 5 stars though - maybe if I was religous I would find the film more intriguing - as it is I do not find it very frightening - but well done.
B00006690G|4.0|\\"DukeOfEarl\\" is an idiot and obviously hasn't paid any attention to Bush and the FCC's strangle hold on free speech.
B00005JMYI|5.0|I walked out of the theater thinking, \\"wow that was a really funny movie.\\" My two friends I went with even thought it was funnier than I did. I'll just say this... it's not the greatest movie. The storyline is just ok, but this is a COMEDY and it does make you laugh. Will Ferrell is just plain funny, and knows how to make people laugh. You should get this movie, or atleast check it out.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|source: [...] <br /> <br />Sometimes you find an album, which literally mutates your mind, amazes your aural senses and changes your outlook on music. In 1997 it was `OK Computer', now in 2004 it's Montreal's Arcade Fire's `Funeral'. Never have I heard an album so intelligent both music and idea-wise. The minute I popped it into my stereo the whole thing enveloped me and is dominating my life to this very second. <br /> <br />Although I hate to use the term, `Funeral' has an underlying theme (the power of love), but it is not exhaustivingly progressive. In fact although there are twists and turns in the music, they seem perfectly natural. <br />  <br />\\"Neighbourhood 1-4\\" is what you may define as a suite but it is definitely not the case as there are songs and different sets of melodies, plus these four pieces clock in at about 3-4 minutes each, so there is a certain economy. And don't forget the glorious tunes that are encapsulated in the first part of the album. I can hear shades of The Flaming Lips, Neutral Milk Hotel, Gang of Four and countless others BUT the sound is one hundred percent theirs, which makes a unique combination and it is never, ever claustrophobic. <br /> <br />The second half of the album is just as grandiose and fantastic, especially THE standout (of many standouts) `Haiti', with its half-French half-English lyrics, acoustic strum, thumping drum and whooshy (yes, whooshy) voices. `Funeral' concludes with `In the Backseat' which involves all 15 members of the band singing in complete harmony and is one of the most evocative things I have ever heard. <br /> <br />The album places its listener into its own world and you feel everything the band does. The songs have a way of manipulating your feelings - when the song is energetic or mellow you're going to feel the same way. Even on its many moments of naïve charm and beauty you'll get that feeling too, almost like you're a child discovering the beauty of the world for the first time. <br />Whatelse could I say about this beguiling piece of music overwashed with a thousand melodies? It may change your life, it may make the world a better place, you may burn the rest of your collection and keep `Funeral' only, as a testament of how it will lodge itself in your existence. I'd better quit now and let you, dear listener, discover this treat. Album of the year? Album of the next ten years? Maybe or maybe only until Arcade Fire release album number two - who knows, who cares? We've got this and trust me its just fine.   <br />
B0006213H6|4.0|I would have to say this album isn't quite as good as gaetis Byrjun or ( ). It's very experimental and ambient. If you're a Sigur Rs fan, buy this album. You will not be disappointed. It's completely different then their most recent albums, but you can still feel how they have evolved as a band through this album. The album starts out with an eerie 9 minute track of just ambient sounds. It then leads into a few songs that sound the most like songs on gaetis Byrjun, but they are still nothing like the songs on that album. The highlight of the album for me is the title track Von. It's a very sad and emotional song with very airy sounding vocals. If you don't have any Sigur Rs and you're thinking about buying an album of theirs, I recommend you buy gaetis Byrjun before Von. I think the sheer emotion and feeling behind that album will make you respect them that much more.  But by all means, if you like Sigur Rs, buy this album. It's well worth the money.
B000001FQQ|5.0|The 2nd best KISS release sans the Make-Up. The HITS tour that followed was MASSIVE & my favorite KISS tour. 15 tracks are included and here's my picks for the best ones.  <br /> <br />\\"Rise to it\\" \\"Betrayed\\" \\"Hide Your Heart\\" \\"Prisoner of Love\\" \\"Love's a Slap in the Face\\" \\"You Love Me to Hate You\\" \\"Somewhere Between (Heaven and Hell)\\" and who can forget about \\"Forever\\" which became KISS's biggest hit since their 1979 smash hit \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\"  <br /> <br />Sadly though, the HITS album & tour would be Eric Carr's final stint with KISS. Eric was an AWESOME Drummer, but most of all a great person who really cared about his fans. R.I.P Eric, you will never be forgotten.  <br /> <br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Hot in the Shade to anyone who likes good Rock and Roll, and that's what KISS has always been about.
0062502182|5.0|In thought it was a very well-written book.  It opened my spirit up to roam through hidden dreams.  Great inspiration snuggled into a story!
B000001DYJ|3.0|It would have been cool to hear Strutter, Parasite, Hotter Than Hell & 100,000 Years but Alive III still deliver's the goods.  <br /> <br />The best tracks are: Deuce, Heaven's On Fire, Rock and Roll All Nite & Take it Off (import only)  <br /> <br />Don't have it? Better get it!
B000000H5J|5.0|This is fear factory best album don't listen to the one star reviewers they just don't know good heavy music when they hear it.
B0001MDP3G|1.0|Cold Mountain seemed to have a good start with some great footage of what Civil War trench warfare might have been like. After about five minutes, though, you could predict the outcome which really dragged on. What was personally offensive to me was the depiction of a pastor as a drunk, womanizing hypocrite. While I'm certain that there have been a few of these in history, I have to wonder why Hollywood always depicts them this way?. My question is why we don't ever see a Rabbi being ridiculed?  <br />  Other problems with the movie include the accents of Nicole and Rene which are almost impossible to understand. Also, the Southern men of this era were raised to be gentlemen. The bloodthirsty killers of Southern Army deserters are difficult to believe. This movie should not be rented or bought. It is poorly written and directed.
B00003CXCT|3.0|OK - I broke down & still bought this.  I can understand why people are upset and don't want to 'pay' Lucas for the changes.  And I have to admit I can't appreciate any of the changes.  The thing that bothers me the most - the changes in script/dialogue/scoring.  I could ignore the few minutes of digital changes, BUT! It sounds like Anthony Daniels (C-3PO) re-taped his whole dialogue!  There are many word changes from numerous characters but even worse are the changes in the intonation and emotion old lines - the whole movie feels different and it really bugs!  The new digital effects - They ARE really bad.  However, I loved these so much as a child and don't have a VCR or TV to watch the old ones....so it was worth it just to have a taste of what they used to be.  But oh I miss the past!
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|I agree with the others that this one isn't as good as Devils' night.. but it's still got a lot of pretty good good tracks.. <br /> <br />1. Git up <br />9. How Come <br />15. D-12 world <br />16. 40oz <br />18. Psycho <br />20. Good Die Young...
B0002OERI0|3.0|Ok, so the year is 2004 and Green Day is releasing their newest original album... and they are still being classified as *cough* \\"punk rock\\". Punk died around 1987, 1988, get over it. The only thing we have left from the punk era is the music which helped INFLUENCE Green Day... anyways! This is about the album, so here it is. <br /> <br />Most of the tracks are fairly catchy I guess, Green Day has always had a nack for that. I do think they are trying to push the whole \\"maturity\\" thing too far, they are only kidding themselves with complicated melodies and acoustic guitar. <br /> <br />They have always been a weird and different band, but they are having a small identity crisis here. They retain that slightly \\"unhinged\\" sense in over half the songs, but they've lost the old  \\"having fun\\" touch that made me laugh while listening to stuff such as 'She' or 'Hitchin A Ride'. <br /> <br />Def listen if you're a Green Day fan, but don't expect exactly what yur looking for; I would avoid this if you like true punk (adicts, threats, etc...), but if you are a Good Charlotte or Blink 182 fan you'll probably fit right in.
B000006YYM|5.0|1974, hmnnn, what a year for 'rock' music THAT was!!Iwas there!Many 'progressive' rock bands will remain forever as true musical 'giants'(Caravan, King Crimson, YES ,Genesis, Tull, Gong, e.t.c, e.t.c.)-Gentle Giant were definitely one of THE most talented/memorable(their 'time signatures' alone!!)Iremember the shock & absolute hoy ,when first hearingtracks off the \\"3 Friends\\" album(still one of their BEST albums,by the way)..from then on, their was no stopping me (& a LOT of my friends)..i simply bought them ALL!!!Anyway...this particular release..\\"Power & the Glory\\" was , as others have remarked on this site, one excellent album!..\\"Proclamation\\" is an excellent album opener (Hail to power & to Glory's way!!).....\\"Aspirations\\" by keyboard wizard Kerry Minnear, (now a bona-fide Christian, like me!) was /still is my favourite song on this album-phew..what an atmospheric piece it is still!!,& what a great voice Kerry possessed , too!!However, Mr. Shulman(Derek), as usual steals centre-stage, with that amazing sound his voice possessed!(Derek, re-form THE GIANT immediately!!!!) O h to return to those blissful 70's sounds,to-day's music just CANNOT compete!I digress......\\"Cogs-in-cogs\\", this song-piece was truly Gentle Giant in FULL flow-no-one else really sounded like this!!!The Title cut, \\"Power & the Glory\\" i remember getting on a 7\\" single(not on the orig. album)-a great, great title song, a Giant masterpiece...this album, along with perhaps \\"In a Glass House\\", i would consider their finest stuff.Athoroughlr recommended album!Come back Gentle Giant(buy their NEW d.v.d. In Concert release, too!!Most excellent!!!!
B000002VRZ|5.0|This is a wonderful \\"snapshot\\" of the most talented under appreciated great southern rock band of the 70's. These guys had it all and if you were lucky enough to see them \\"LIVE\\" you know what true southern rock is all about. The only sad thing about this collection is they didn't include two of Hughie Thomasson's best songs. (Angels Hide from Ghostriders & Just For You from Lady in Waiting). Enjoy & keep hopin Hughie will get finished with Skynyrd & crank up The Outlaws once more.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Metora is about as original as the next album from the next artist. Im sick of hearing little and big people alike come around and act proud that they're listening to Linkin park. Its not that angry guys. what makes you want to be angry listening to this? I get angry listening to the singer trying to scream. You suck! Your whole band is about as angry as Nora Jones. Good job guys, you just won best rock from MTV, a channel dedicted to kids who dont know what rock is. Same goes for that girl crap from velvet revoler and evenesence(no excuses, look at kittie). Go suck on small objects. The only people who can pull off that girl look and still be cool are Jrockers like miyavi and Deadman. Anyways. help support music by not wasting money on this junk, and if you havent listened or watched their stuff by now, go download all their stuff to steal all their money. Also, Cannibal Corpse does F'ing rule, and death metal is all us real rockers got to mosh too. Not to your Hip-hop dance beats.
0385508417|2.0|In response to another reviewer asking if this book was as insipid and screamingly obvious as it appeared, YES, it is. With the big movie coming out, I picked the book up out of curiousity and read it cover to cover. Boy, did it READ like a movie too, and I could see the ending walking up Hemlock Street. The only other Grisham I've read was \\"A Painted House,\\" which seems immensely more entertaining, plausable, interesting when compared to this piece of detritus. If you're looking for a book that panders to the materialistic suburbanite crowd, and you can't get into the books that Oprah and The Today Show tell you to read, this is for you.
630245333X|1.0|The original 1958 film, [[ASIN:B00004W3HE The Blob - Criterion Collection]] (which you should see first) really wasn't that bad.  I guarantee you watch it and you will get hooked.  That is really what small towns looked like, the way movie theaters used to look like and that is what people wore, and the kind of simple wholesome houses they lived in.  people spoke politly then.   The 1958, \\"The Blob\\" had young Steve McQueen in his first film ever and with Aneta Corseaut.    A sequel to \\"The Blob\\" was made, [[ASIN:B00004W193 Beware! The Blob!]] (1972) also known as SON OF BLOB (1972), with Larry Hagman, Cindy Williams and other familar faces.  Directed by Larry Hagman, he still laughs today at how low-budget it was.    For this generation, we have a new modern version, \\"The Blob\\" (1988).  Filmed in Abbeville, Louisiana.      Noteable cast is: Shawnee Smith, Ricky Paull Goldin, Candy Clark, Beau Billingslea and Clayton Landey.  Not as good as the original.  Why is it rated \\"R\\"?  I only watched this film because Mr. Ricky Paull Goldin was in it.    Wait until free tv for this one.
0393035158|5.0|An important and brave work.  When will the great majority of mankind overcome its intellectual laziness, as well as its selfish need to believe in eternal life, and admit that it simply has no proof of the validity of any religious thought?  We must use our ability to reason, and this power alone, to devise time-tested rules by which we can all live.  We avoid this imperative at our peril.  I'd like to think that increased attention to education, economic development, and a free exchange of ideas in the developing world will one day soon temper the deadliest of the extremist fringe.    I would recommend Bertrand Russell's writings on religion as well as a subscription to the magazine Free Inquiry for those who are concerned about this sad and dangerous state of affairs.
B00000F1D3|5.0|In 1998, most doubted that Cher would return with full force into the music mainstream.  Though she acted in some successful films between her previous successful song (1991) to 1998, many wondered if she still had more left.  By this time, she had been famous for 35 years, starting with \\"I Got You Babe\\" as half of Sonny & Cher.  Then in fall 1998, the song \\"Believe\\" was released.  Suddenly, it was commonly played on the radio like the old days.  It would later reach #1 on the Billboard Top 100 Singles Charts and stay there for four weeks. <br /> <br />This Grammy-winning single (Best Dance Recording, 1999) got millions of listeners dancing like how nobody had danced to her singles before.  Her newfound techno theme gave new meaning to dance music.  The vocal robotics in its various spots give the techno theme the additional fun flavor.  Such musical combination gave a fresh element to dance music.  This single is said by many to be her career best.   <br /> <br />Cher's album \\"Believe\\" contains all great dance songs like the single of the same name.  The grave quality throughout proves that she still had the magic that first made her a star.  She takes her newfound dance theme to new levels with each individual song.  This album contains many interesting twistes and turns through experiments with various genre elements: disco (\\"Strong Enough\\"), latin (\\"Dov'e L'Amore\\"), dancehall (\\"We All Sleep Alone\\"), and others.  All have that catchy element that attracts listeners.  Her vocal performances give each individual song the added amazement whether smooth or energetic.  Her gift of entertainment takes her far on this album as it always has. <br /> <br />Before the release, she had already been hailed by many as the queen of \\"fabulous\\".  \\"Believe\\" takes that label further.  She proves that it's more than her unforgettable outfits that makes her remarkable.  Therefore, this album is sure to please many listeners young and old.

He gets very lonely and he writes letters explaining why he is lonely.  He meets some people who are older then him.  He gets along with them and becomes part of their circle of friends.  He falls in love with a girl named Sam, the moment he saw her.  Charlie learns very fast that you cant always get what you want, and things don't always happen the way you want them to.  There are hidden perks to being a wallflower. <br /> <br />Author Bio- Stephen Chbosky was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  He went to the Filmic Writing program at a school in South Carolina.  The Perks of Being A Wallflower was his first novel, in 1999. <br /> <br />Evaluation- The Perks of Being A Wallflower was a great book.  This book had a way of making you not want to put the book down.  It was full of surprises and different teenage events that happened to him that I could sometimes relate to.  I loved reading of how he found friends, and became closer with his family.  Hopefully there is a sequel one day, so we can figure out how Charlie is doing! <br />
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|A good film, but the key part of 'Big Fish' rests in your belief that young Ed Bloom (as portrayed by Ewan McGregor) can become old Ed Bloom (Albert Finney).<br /><br />No way.<br /><br />I never for a second bought into that, and instead spent the entire time thinking about what a absurd leap of faith that required.  By contrast, Alison Lohman becoming Jessica Lange was a lot more believable...unfortunately, that connection is not as tantamount to the core story.<br /><br />Do you want to see a movie where the young-to-old transition works at a fascinating level?  Check out the 2001 release \\"Iris\\" where young John Bayley - as played by Hugh Bonneville - morphs into the eldery version played by Jim Broadbent.  You would *swear* this was the same actor playing both roles.  And, equally impressive, we get two very famous actresses - Kate Winslet and Judi Dench - playing young and old Iris Murdoch respectively to great effect and a semaless transition.  That's the gold standard for this technique in my mind.  'Big Fish' comes up short.
B000021Y77|3.0|Run Lola Run. The first time I watched this flick (which is a in my own personal DVD collection) I wasn't blown away. There's allot of hype about the flick, how great the movie is, how mind blowing the music is, blah blah blah... and with the advice Flavor Flave gave us all about \\"the hype\\", I didn't believe it. Instead, I went out and bought it because I was curious. The plot? Girl runs to save boyfriend. That's it. It was like \\"Groundhog Day\\" on ecstasy. I'll give it credit for being original. I'll give it credit for knotting up all the details. I'll give it credit for energy, as it had a lot... but in the end, I was rather bored with the ending. It kind of fell off. The music, house music, which you can find in most new age independent films. Watch it in German with the subtitles, because the English dub is so over-acted, it makes it look ridiculous. You'll enjoy it more in German, as I did... the second time.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Ah, yes, Van Helsing. Boy does this stink.  I'm not sure how many real people are actually in this film because after a while it looks like a saturday morning cartoon.  Too much CGI and not enough of anything else.  The story is lame, the acting is lame, the dialogue is more than lame. As to resolution, well as loud as it was, I finally gave up and fell asleep. Save your money, the economy is bad.
B00003CXV4|4.0|Keanu Reeves, and Charlize Theron, Jason Isaacs, in a story about love, death, and re-building ones life based on different priorities... about building them instead on romance.

068987474X|5.0|This book had me rolling on the floor, literally. It's really that funny. The scenarios presented are often too true for most of us.  The book gives common sense advice, but some women need to hear it - over and over again.
6305127697|5.0|Would you believe I just saw this two weeks ago? I was blown away. Ed Norton in what appears to be one of his first movies, could still very well be one of his best performances. I hated Richard Gere the entire movie, but seeing Ed Norton fumbling, and stuttering, and well... acting. Brilliant. This re-confirmed the fact that he's one of the best actors of our time. I completely and totally recommend this movie. You will be SHOCKED.
B000000HZZ|5.0|Japan were never properly understood by critics. Beyond Sylvian's pretty face and all the hair and make-up and stylish European affectations some pretty complex musical arrangements were going down. <br /> <br />I read reviewer fellow Amazon customer Merz-head's review, and suddenly flashed back to 1981, when Japan were frequently panned in the NME and other Brit music rags after every new LP or single release.  I guess they were doing something right if their complex electronic dance and mood music are still confounding people, (in Hammond, Louisiana, no less) from 1981 and 20 years later on.  <br /> <br /> I love ALL of Japan's records--from the gritty Euroglam 70's <br />to the sleek Eurodance singles of 1979-80 (Giorgio Moroder even took a crack at them when he produced their \\"Life in Tokyo\\" 12-inch), and then the final 1981 masterpiece  \\"Tin Drum\\", with its Prophet5 synth-enhanced Oriental stylings and deep funk bass lines, and Sylvian's subsequent collaboratory 12'inch with Yellow Magic Orchestra's Ryuichi Sakamoto in \\"Bamboo Houses/Bamboo Music and of course, the sublime theme from film, Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence, the gorgeous \\"Forbidden Colours\\". <br /> <br />Awesome work from Sylvian et al.  I know there's no going back, but Japan's oeuvre has solidly stood the test of time and it's great seeing these recordings get the treatment and reconsideration they've always deserved. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JKC3|2.0|What was Ang Lee thinking when he made this flick. Alright... here's the good part... the animation was AMAZING. The hulk looked and felt and reacted like a real human...(sorta) but the plot was so !@#$ing weak. I mean... seriously, I went to support the industry, and to see the re-birth of the hulk, but where can they go from here? It was ghastly. Details left for the imagination. Why did his shorts look fine in the morning when he woke up again as Bruce Banner. Were they spandex? Come on man, let's cover the details! ugh...
B00005JMX6|4.0|This movie was not what I expected.  From the cover I was thinking it would be something along the same lines of THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY.  While there certainly were elements here & there of slapstick comedy, for the most part this film was nothing like that.<br /><br />Instead, THE GIRL NEXT DOOR is a sort of dark comedy.  It seems to always hold about 60% disturbing plot and 40% comedy.  It is a bizarre mix, but it works.  After watching this film I felt different than I've felt watching any DVD the past 5 years.<br /><br />Elisha Cuthbert is dazzling as a beauty who lives next door.  She also just so happens to be a porn star.  Who would have thought?  Timothy Olyphant gives the strongest performance of the movie.  This is important as his pivotal role is the one on which the rest of the film swivels back & forth.<br /><br />For some reasons the story had a very 1980s feel to it.  For one, during the 80s the world of pornography was depicted as having a very dark underbelly.  Which, perhaps, it did.  While this may still be true to some extent these days, it is not nearly so entrenched in people's minds as it used to be.<br /><br />As for the DVD being unrated, I didn't see anything out of the ordinary that would warrant that rating.  I have not seen the \\"R\\" rated version so I don't have any grounds to compare the two.  However, I'm guessing that there can't be too much difference between the two.<br /><br />If you're looking for a film that is not what it appears, this one might be worth a look.  If you want a movie that will have you laughing hysterically I would recommend finding something different.  There are plenty of Romantic Comedies out there that are way more funny than this one.  The strength of GND is in its unique tone, not its comedic elements.
B00005JKJA|3.0|I'm so sick of people ranting and raving about David Lynch movies, jumping on the bandwagon about the \\"experience\\" and how epic his movies are. Aside from the constant lesbian action, DAVID LYNCH IS AWFUL!<br /><br />This movie is yet another twisted, unclear, freak show brought to you by David Lynch, who also did that series that I never understood called \\"Twin Peaks\\". I sat through this movie confused, unclear, and bored.<br /><br />First it's a girl in an accident, then no memory, then dyking it out. I'll tell you this however, the only reason this movie scored points with me is because the main character was GORGEOUS. There's a bunch of topless lesbian scenes where you're blown away by that figure, but beyond that, the blond girl was stupid, and who the hell was the cowboy? I gave it a 3.

B00006JDVV|3.0|In present-day London, 12-year-old Quinn is the first to discover an enormous fire-breathing monster which inadvertently kills his mother after it wakes an from its centuries-long slumber. Twenty years later, much of the world has been destroyed by the beast and its offspring. Quinn (Christian Bale) is responsible for a small community just outside london in a makeshift castle as they eke out a meager existence. (having no food, drinking only water, and hiding from the dragons). Along comes a bad ass american \\"Dragon Slayer\\" and his makeshift crew who says he has a way to kill the all the beasts and save mankind. To be honest, I'm biased because I'm a fan of Christian Bale. He over-acted a bit in this movie, however, so did Matthew McConaughey, who played Van Zan, the hot shot american GI. The Special Effects were bad ass... and I liked how they portrayed the dragons, not too Western style, not too Eastern. My issues however were that they left things hanging. They showed Christian Bale pulling an egg out of the belly of a dead Dragon. What did he do with that? Where did they get fuel? Too many unanswered questions. Go see the movie if you want entertainment but it wont stimulate your mind. Although this isn't Christian Bale's best work, it's fun to watch.
B0000CFW87|1.0|There are two bedrooms in my dorm, and in the bedroom next to mine, one of the two guys that lives there plays this CD constantly. I can't STAND it. <br /> <br />I am not familiar with this style of music, (pop/opera/crying?) but I don't know why it exists. The most annoying song on this album is, without a doubt, \\"When You Say You Love Me\\". My dormmate sings along with this one, and I would literally go insane if I wasn't able to put on some headphones and drown out Mr. Groban with some quality music. Groban's crooning is simply a conveyance of overindulgence and false emotion. <br /> <br />For truly emotional vocals (along with superb instrumentals), listen to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards on The Rolling Stones' 1972 masterpiece Exile On Main Street. If you demand the \\"opera\\" style of singing, I would suggest the earlier music of the band Queen. They were never as good as The Rolling Stones used to be, but Freddie Mercury's vocals are infinitely stronger than those of Josh Groban.
B00005JLKN|3.0|This is the prequel to \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", and it kind of lays out the story very nicely. I enjoyed \\"Silence\\". I thought \\"Hannibal\\" was MUCH too graphic, and it made me physically sick... however, I did enjoy the movie. I thought that \\"The Candyman\\" wasn't built enough. He should have been more muscular, as the storyline defines him as a big, strong, weightlifter, etc... and he's not. He's a skinney guy with a bad ass tattoo. Anthony Hopkins did a great job in this, as he's done in the past, and I was impressed by Edward Norton. He's the man. Rent it, and watch it in the dark with someone you love.

B00005QFE5|5.0|Zhang Ziyi, if your reading this, I love you, and I want to marry you. You are absolutely gorgeous, completely cute, and your movies blow me away each and every time. The Road Home made me smile, made me cry, made me laugh, and then did it all over again. It's a love story. A story that will make you laugh, cry, and smile as well. I recommend this to anyone. I gave it a 5 for cinematography, for emotion, and for my love of Zhang Ziyi. Rent it, buy it, enjoy it. You will love it.
0792164903|5.0|Sleepy Hollow is the perfect mix of humor, suspense, and romance in a movie and it looks really good doing it. Burton and Depp again prove how well they do when teamed up.  <br /> <br />Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is a New York constable sent to the little town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate the murders of several of the towns people. Armed with scientific knowledge and a zest for bringing criminals to justice, Crane goes about trying to rationalize the deaths of people from seemingly supernatural means. Taken with the beautiful Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci), Crane gets more and more deeply involved in the mystery as it threatens his belief in science and questions the realm of the supernatural. With a town full of people hiding secrets, Ichabod must figure out who is hiding the deadly secret that controls the headless horseman.  <br /> <br />Depp is wonderful as the bumbling and easily disgusted Ichabod. He doesn't really have the stomach to be a crime scene investigator, but he does his best and with a hero that hides behind a child once and a woman another time, Depp still makes him extremely likable. Ricci hits a little bit of a sour note as she seems to have a modern personality in a period piece, though she's unworldly enough looking to pull off being a white witch.  <br /> <br />The movie isn't really a horror piece and is more of a mystery. With faded out color except for the distinct blood red that shows up a lot, the movie looks like a gothic piece. Depp looks startlingly striking in the colors that make him more pale than I've ever seen him. The movie is bloody and has quite a bit of gore at some places, as a movie about headless bodies would imply, but it's an engaging piece that is perfect Halloween fare.
B00005JL78|3.0|Visually? Stunning. Acting? Super. Plot? Full of holes. I recommend seeing it just for the visuals. I was really digging the way it looked, the way it flowed, but here's the things I couldn't get past. 1. If the Precogs couldn't see assault, rape, or anything else short of murder, how could the female precog see everything she saw at the mall? (stop here, put down some change, don't forget the umbrella) 2. If there is a ball for the murdered person, and a ball for the murderer, how come there wasn't a ball dropped for the real murderer, Tom Cruise's boss? 3. Why is the deviant's plan so incredibly genius that it hangs on a thread and if ONE thing doesn't go to plan, it would all fall apart, yet it all does work? I don't know. Kind of sketchy. Go see it if you like Tom Cruise. Go see it if you like Spielberg. (it's 10x better than that A.I. crap.) Go see it if you like Sci-Fi. Don't go see it if your looking for a bulletproof plot... because it's not here.
B0001MDP3G|3.0|<br />Highilights of the film: <br /> <br />- Georgia (Jack White) watching helplessly as his friends are massacred whilst tossing his cookies; talk about multi-tasking. <br /> <br />- Ruby (Renee Zellweger) ruins a rooster's lust for life by decapitating it with one hand. <br /> <br />- Somewhat difficult to figure out who's white cheeks we're looking at during the much-expected love scene between Jude & Nicole. <br /> <br />- Sara (Natalie Portman) shoots (and kills) the only soldier compassionate enough to keep her baby warm. This is after Inman (Jude) had already disarmed the poor bastard down to his underpants. <br /> <br />- Rev. Monroe (Donald Sutherland) bites the big one after lingering outside during nasty weather. When will the old geezers learn it's not safe to play in the rain at their age? <br /> <br />- Cow (cow) gets sawed into bits at the hands of Inman (Jude) and Junior (Giovanni Ribissi). Don't worry folks, this takes place after the cow bit the big one.    <br /> <br />- Ferry girl (Jena Malone) gets shot dead after suggesting a $30 \\"donation\\" in exhange for happy fun time at the love shack. Watch as Rev. Veasey's (Phillip Seymour Hoffan) face turns from the expression of a giddy boy awaiting the arrival of Santa Claus on Christmas Eve to giddy boy realizing it's Michael Jackson coming down his chimney instead. <br /> <br />- Kidman's transformation from proper lady to useful woman? Until she's shown me she can decapitate a rooster, she hasn't graduated Useful University.  <br /> <br />- I didn't see the word \\"documentary\\" any where on the poster for this film. Perhaps the people that are whining about the historical depictions should stop and worry about the textbooks utilized in classrooms instead.  <br /> <br />- Not a very \\"farm-animal\\" friendly film; a goat gets its throat slit.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Although it wasn't as streamlined as the original Matrix, this Sequel certainly held it's own. In my own humble opinion, it was bloated, it was slow... it was a love story under the pretense of being an action sci-fi adventure. It was exactly what it needed to be to bring in the big bucks, and prep you for the next one, Matrix Revolutions.... There's lots of action, lots of love making, and who knew that the populace of Zion is all minorities. Yay! Plug me in! For the action alone, you should see it in Dolby digital. But don't expect it to be better than the original. It's not the tight little package that the average dolt will enjoy. If you free your mind before seeing the movie you'll enjoy it.
B00063MBU8|4.0|&quot;Still Not Getting Any&quot; is in my opinion 1000x better than &quot;No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls&quot; because Simple plan's starting to varie in their songs. Instead of just singing about girls and relationships and being mad at Dad.  I also got really tired of the 1st cd because of Pierre's voice. Surprisingly, it's not nearly as annoying now. proly cuz hes growing up and stuff.  Their first single &quot;Welcome To My Life&quot; isn't the best song on the album, its OK song, but i dont know why thye chose it as their first single.  It doesnt even ryme, but whatever,  The cd's AWESOME go get it NOW
B00005JKCH|5.0|I'll say right up front that I enjoyed the movie for entertainments value. I enjoyed the action that Sam Raimi gave us, although I thought it was too fast. It was like Spiderman was too fast for gravity, and that kind of bothered me. It also bothered me that they eliminated his web slingers. That really irked me, because it made Spiderman more careless with his webbing... because there was an endless supply. I was like \\"What the HELL!\\" - The web shooters were an integral part of who Spiderman is, because it made him more human, less freak. Yes, he could walk on walls. Yes, he can jump around. Yes, he was a nerd... but he was never socially acceptable, which is why he was so much more free as Spiderman... with a great sense of humor, confidence, and well... superhero-ness. In the comics, Parker is a nerd. A total geek... and as Spiderman, he's still a man in that suit. He's not superman but they made him seem as though he was as strong as superman, and frankly, that irked me. Beyond that, the movie was cool. I wish the fight scenes were slowed down. The film speed was too high or something, as if you were fast forwarding through the scenes. Beyond that, not a bad adaptation. I just wish they did like X-men did, and kept it direct to the story, and the characters.
0671027344|5.0|Annotation: \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is about a boy named Charlie who is growing up and is a freshman high school. He is writing letters to an anonymous person and explaining all his experiences, up close and personal. He is discovering himself and the people around him. From first loves to family problems to drugs and The Rocky Horror Picture Show this book gives you a real and inside, personal look at a confusing time in one boy's life.  <br /> <br /> <br />Author Bio: Stephen Chbosky grew up in Pittsburgh, PA. He attended the Filmic Writing Program at the University of South Carolina. He won the Best Narrative Feature in 1995 at Chicago Underground Film Festival for \\"The Four Corners of Nowhere\\". He also won the Abraham Polonsky Screenwriting Award for \\"Everything Divided\\". Chbosky resides in New York and \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is his first novel. <br /> <br /> <br />Evaluation: This is by far one of the best-written books I have ever read. I really liked how it was very open and honest and real. I could relate to some parts of it as well. The poem in it was amazing and very well written. I finished this book in about 2 days and couldn't put it down. I would highly recommend this to anyone who would ask. <br />
B00005JLT5|5.0|This film was truly beautiful. There wasn't any suspense, there wasn't any climax... but there was a beautiful WW2 story inside, and it was EPIC.

B0002234LS|4.0|One of the best films I have seen lately.  Reading the reviews, I have noticed most people didn`t like it, but I can`t see why. The ending is quite surprising, even though I had suspected it a little. Johnny Depp is really great.  And the film, in general, is entertaining.  The characters are very real. And the story \\"fits together\\" very well.  The only problem is that some things the main charater does seem somewhat irreal and stupid, but it all fits together later.  It is scary too. Great visualy.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|\\"Genius Loves Company,\\" Ray Charles' posthumous album of twelve duets with contemporary artists, has all the more cemented his status as a musical legend. After having debuted at #2 on the Billboard albums chart in September, the disc has gone on to become Charles' highest-selling recording; his first ever to surpass the 1,000,000 (platinum) sales benchmark. The release also marked his first time in the Top 10 since 1964.<br /><br /> Kicking off the tracklisting is the melancholic \\"Here We Go Again,\\" on which Norah Jones duets. Having made no secret of her great love for Charles and his music, it is no surprise to see her inclusion on the release. Although she was originally intimidated by the prospect of recording with Charles and thus, in her opinion, diminishing the quality of his work, the combination of the two artists works smashingly for the song.<br /><br /> \\"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word,\\" Elton John's 1976 Top 10 smash, makes for an awesome duet between the two bespectacled gentlemen. A classic, over the top ballad full of excruciating pain and longing on John's career-altering \\"Blue Moves\\" album, it is significantly more laid back this time around. Electric guitar riffs give the track an added amplification.<br /><br /> \\"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?\\" a sharp outing with Bonnie Raitt, a fan of Charles since childhood, is a laid-back, slow roast of a song which sharply contrasts with the grandiosely produced \\"It Was a Very Good Year,\\" a duet with the venerable Willie Nelson, who could later barely compose himself at Charles' funeral. Reflective and emotive, their performance on the song is the pinnacle of the disc.<br /><br /> Other more enjoyable moments of the disc include the rousing \\"Sinner's Prayer\\" with B.B. King and the lush \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" with Johnny Mathis, which is impassioned enough to make the overheard classic an essential listen. Additionally, \\"Hey Girl,\\" a suave duet with Michael McDonald, is buoyed by the pair's honeyed vocals, while \\"Crazy Love\\" with Van Morisson provides a dollop of ear candy to bring the disc to its regretful conclusion.<br /><br /> Even in the rather forced company of Natalie Cole and Diana Krall, it is easy to see that Charles is enjoying himself immensely. Having been most gratuitous for the fact that that the artists he hand chose to duet with were more than willing to come to his studio to record with him, it is no surprise that this collection turned out so splendidly. It is as encouraging as it is entertaining to see the extent to which Charles enjoyed his passion for music all the way through to the very end of his career with this final release. \\"Genius Loves Company\\" is a true testament to the love of music from one of its most memorable talents.yed vocals, while \\"Crazy Love\\" with Van Morisson provides a dollop of ear candy to bring the disc to its regretful conclusion. <br /> <br /> Even in the rather forced company of Natalie Cole and Diana Krall, it is easy to see that Charles is enjoying himself immensely.

B00000DGUG|4.0|Ok, so with the arrival of Alanis' second album, we discover that she is, in fact, very odd. <br /> <br />Her lyrics are more like sentances on this album.  She has lost most of her anger, and explored many religious and expressive forms on this album.  This album is also very dark comparatively.  It's like Alanis moved to Mars, or something. <br /> <br />Some of the tracks are truly stunning, like \\"Thank U\\", \\"Can't Not\\", and \\"So Pure\\".  She gets downright weird (equals transgendered) on \\"Couch\\". <br /> <br />It's a worthwhile CD, and the change of pace is refreshing and welcomed.  Not everyone can be angry all of the time.  This CD is worth it.
B00005JKG7|3.0|Fog is a campy 80s movie. It's not scary but still worth a look. Scream Queen Curtis is in it.
B000002MY3|5.0|Ok so I know it's not technically her first album, but this is her big-radio debut. <br /> <br />This album is flat out amazing. <br /> <br />The only drawback is that Alanis has a hard time figuring out what true Irony is, and how to properly use the concept.  A lot of her songs have a common theme of, \\"You wanted this, but you got this\\" or \\"It's only like this because it's like this\\".  An album of Murphy-ism, sort of.  It's not enough to subtract a star though. <br /> <br />Alanis has a lot of anger and a lot of love to release on this CD.  \\"You Oughtta Know\\" does a pretty good job releasing the anger, I believe.  The love comes out in some various places.  And the rest of the CD involves Alanis giving us advice.  Like...\\"You Learn\\". <br /> <br />The best track on the CD, in my opinion, is \\"Forgiven\\".  She so emotionally sings her beliefs and morals in this song, it's numbing. <br /> <br />Give the CD a listen.  It's definitely worth it.
B0002I831S|4.0|I am elated that the original series is now available in the three season/package format.  The transfers are very clean and look reasonably good and the Dolby 5.1 audio takes the program quality to an even higher level.  The packaging?  Extremely cumbersome and awkard--more printed documentation could and should have been added. Die-hard Trekkies deserve more. Afterall, this is, in many respects, both a science fiction and televison historical artifact, it is not? Fans who are purchasing this set already know which are the finest episodes of this first season, so there is no need to elaborate.<br /><br />The extras are very nice.  I enjoyed the documentary on William Shatner and learning about his new passion--raising and breeding prize horses and his charity work. Other segments hosted by the series' co-stars are also entertaining and informative--Walter Koenig lends some interesting insights into the production of the series and there are some segments with the late James Doohan.  However, I wish the popular \\"blooper reel\\" could have been included.  Traditionally, this is very hard to find and could only be viewed at Star Trek conventions.<br /><br />People wonder why shows like Star Trek endure and matter today.  Of course, today the special effects are crude, the sets and the costumes imaginative but sometimes laughable, but the answer is rather simple: Star Trek is much like the myths of Homer's Odyssey and Illiad--tales retold to each succeeding generation filled with adventure, danger, and courage that resonate and touch us immeasurably with a sustaining hope that the future is a brighter one.<br /><br />I also like the new way Paramount has done their commentaries for several specific episodes.  Done with animated/written \\"pop ups\\" that occupy only a small fraction of the screen, these are far less intrusive than the usual \\"voiceover\\" that drowns out the dialogue of the actual show--Kudos to you, Paramount!
B0002OERI0|4.0|This album is a testament to the musical growth of Green Day.

068987474X|5.0|Pssst...You!  Yes, you!  Come here... You know that coffee or foyer table you keep those lovely magazines on, all sprawled out in lovely fanlike expression for the momentary entertainment of your guests?  Well, this little gem of a read should be the cherry on top because I guarantee you it will be a conversation piece for a long time to come and...you may even uncover a few thieves along the way.  It's just that good!  I bought this book on a Friday afternoon; it is now Sunday evening and I am finished.  Work, laundry, homework, shopping; yup, I did all of that in between.  Again - yes, it's just that good!   <br /> <br />There are many relationship books out there, but this is by far the no-holds-barred look at men and why we women do the darn things we do to keep them.  I found myself in Chapters One and Two and a few loved ones down the road.  It is not for the faint of heart or those who see the sunshine, but are unwilling to wake up from the nightmare.  We all have a little sleep in our eyes that needs to be quickly wiped away.  Written by a man about men (with a woman's point of view thrown in for balance - thanks, Liz!), you cannot go wrong.  Greg Behrendt gives it to you straight, ladies, no chaser.  I didn't agree with every nugget of advice, but most of it is invaluable information, emphasis on MOST!   Hear me, ladies: two words: PLEASE READ!   <br /> <br />\\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" is going on my Christmas list this year for every single woman I know.  Hey, maybe even before then - many of them need a dose of this truth tonic IMMEDIATELY!   <br /> <br />Okay, now go tell all of your friends or, at the very least, let them borrow the book.  But be sure to collect interest payments though because they're going to want to keep it! (Shhh... just between you and me.)    <br />

B00005LQ04|5.0|\\"When a dream becomes a nightmare, the average dreamer just wants to wake up...\\" M.McDonagh. <br /> <br />Argento is pure genius. <br /> <br />Suspiria is a relentless, supernatural expressionistic vision. <br />A gorgeous nightmarish dream drenched in saturated colours. <br />Swirling, surreal, vivid, pulsating and sumptuous. <br /> <br />Forget the narrative, tune on the imagery and the details. <br /> <br />Our Lady of Darkness
B00005JNEI|2.0|I recently watched interviews with five of the people featured in this film.  Every one of them said that they were upset with the way they were represented.  Their replies were cut and manipulated to fit Mr. Moore's purpose and did not at all reflect what they were saying.  As a concept, I actually think that's kind of funny.  However, considering the subject matter, there arises a very dangerous possibility. <br />I overheard some kids (who couldn't have been over fourteen or fifteen) talking about how The Pentagon wasn't really hit on 9/11.  One of them said that Iraq was going to become a U.S. territory and, oh yes, the draft was coming back.  After all that, they started talking about this film and how awful our president is and how they can't believe he's getting away with all of this.  Well, I'll tell you how...IT'S NOT TRUE. <br />Michael Moore obviously has it in for Bush.  This work, obviously nowhere near a documentary, is intended to slander, degrade and persuade.  If it were a \\"Daily Show\\" or \\"Saturday Night Live\\" special, I would've probably liked it.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amlie is a young, independent woman working as a waitress in a caf near Sacr-Coeur. The secondary characters in the film are charicatures of typical Parisians, but they are the sort of odd mix you might find in any big city. Amlie finds herself in the middle of a bit of a mystery one day and that mystery guides the plot towards the ultimate happy ending, true love. <br /> <br />There are some detours on the way. Amlie reintroduces her father to life with creative use of a garden gnome. She teaches an overbearing shop keeper a lesson on how to treat people, plus a few other entertaining sidetracks. There are good subplots involving the secondary characters as well. All this makes for a very rich and entertaining movie. <br /> <br />The film itself is beautiful, Paris doesn't look as good in real life as it does in this movie. The colors are exceptional and the music is charming. If you're a fan of contemporary French movies it has a few recognizable faces from other movies, like Isabelle Nanty, who does a fabulous job as a weird hypochondriac tobbaconist and Mathieu Kassovitz who plays Amlie's well-matched love interest.  <br /> <br />The first time I watched this movie, I wished everyone I knew spoke French because the subtitles do leave a bit to be desired, but I think people are still clever enough to figure out what is going on. Its just a shame to miss the nuances and idiosyncrasies of each character that their manner of speaking reflects. My husband loved it though and his French is just so-so. <br /> <br />If you are open to a well made romantic comedy and speak French or don't mind reading sub-titles, I highly recommend this movie.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I HAVE NEVER BEEN A BRITNEY SPEARS FAN, but after her \\"Britney\\"  album came out i was intrigued. She flipped the whole script and came out with a more mature Britney that i enjoyed more that her bubble gum teen days. <br /> <br />HERE COMES \\"IN THE ZONE\\"....i truly think that this is her best album yet. The reason i gave this album 5 stars its because it so diverse. Touch of my Hand ...errr...( the first time around i missed the point of the song then it hit me). But its still a good song.If u dont have this album yet, go get it because its worth ever penny. <br />And to all of u girls and boys that hate Britney...stop hating and start appreciating....she may not b strong vocally, but what she can do with her voice to a simple song is amazing.. In my list, she is my FAV POP ARTIST right now.
0684833395|5.0|At first I was skeptical.  After hearing mixed reviews on the book, I wasn't sure if I could weather 450+ pages of nonsense.  But I found the book to be a literary adventure, and a mentally stimulating experience.  At one point, I found myself feeling almost as delirious as the characters in the book, only to realize that I may be the only one with my head screwed on properly.  The book opens a gateway into the mind of humans as we strive to survive in this world of unexpected outcomes.  And as you will see, Yossarian lives.
B00015HVI8|3.0|Wow[...] a dismal, dark chapter in the Stargate series. Jonas Quinn? Honestly, this is the best they can do to replace Daniel Jackson? Too bad they couldn't be more imaginative with the execution of this character.  What a terribly unappealing, wooden, and pale imitation of the original character he was supposed to replace.<br /><br />I wish these episodes would be sold individually.  If I could, I'd pick Abyss (one of the all-time best episodes), The Changeling and Full Circle.  The rest I could honestly live without.<br /><br />This was Stargate at its worst - no question.  An abysmal season, but \\"Abyss\\" was worth the price of the set alone - one of the finest hours of Stargate ever.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|I liked the first Matrix film because of the music, the action and the special effects.  It had a few weaknesses in the storyline and the science of the Matrix was substandard even for a sci-fi movie, but it was a great action movie and that made it fun.   <br /> <br />The second and third movies had the action that made the first movie great, but they seemed like fanfiction - like those books Kevin J. Anderson wrote based on the Star Wars movies.  I simply couldn't buy Keanu Reeves and Hugo Weaving fighting for control of the world and flying through the air.  It seemed kind of stupid.   <br /> <br />One of the weaknesses in the trilogy is that the strength of the first movie was Neo adjusting to living in the Matrix.  When the second movie started, he was suddenly Superman and it took away a lot of what made the character interesting.  To make things worse, the brothers focused too heavily on boring and sucky characters.
B00005JMCT|2.0|Well where can you go from here? Thankfully nowhere, like the awful 'Scream' series, American Pie is finally over. There were so many people missing from this movie that they should have called it \\"Nobody was Interested in a Third Slice.\\"<br /><br />Even the reliable Stiffler character was getting old by now. To change him up a bit the directors tried to reverse the roles of Stiffler and Finch. It didn't work. Also by now you have to really wonder about Stiffler. Outdancing a gay man in a gay bar is not something he would want his next score to know.<br /><br />And what was with the bachelor party scene? It made no sense. Why throw a bachelor party for three people and the groom isn't even around? Of course the strippers were hot, espescially the cop.<br /><br />Ok gross out scenes here were Stiffler eating dog poop, a wedding cake covered in pubic hair, and the granny love closet. The best thing in this movie was Stiffler's 1979 black Trans Am. I wish I still had mine.<br /><br />But by now the jokes were old, the characters (well the ones who showed up anyway) were just going through the motions, and Jimbo is still a quirky buffoon, but he can dance now.<br /><br />And of course at the end you know Stiffler's mom is showing up.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|This is the greatest in the series of trials and tribulations for the Griswalds'.  I will never forget the scenes with the Christmas lights and the speech Clark gives to everyone when it's hitting the fan!  \\"We're going to be the hap-hap-happiest bunch of...\\"  I will never look at Christmas the same again!
B0002KVULG|4.0|<br />In the Making Of featurette, Langella recommends that if you want a horrific or menacing version Count Dracula, rent another version. <br /> <br />He is very right: This version is a romance, pure and simple. It takes the subliminal aspect of the vampire legend and emphasises it, to great effect. I LOVE this version. It is my favorite in spite of some shortcomings. <br /> <br />The sets are lush and detailed, the score is moody, haunting and stirring. The locations are authentic (no CGI here!) and impressive. But this is Langella's movie. His Count is tragic, compelling, charming, measured and still. This Count is also 6'4\\", dark, with amazing eyes, a velvet voice, and a still, focused presence.  <br /> <br />In short, were he to visit my room as he does Mina's and Lucy's (climbing down and up walls with his cape billowing behind) in a cloud of smoke, I would most certainly be one of the damned...willingly, I think. <br /> <br />Langella brings his broadway perfomance as Count Dracula to the screen, with John Badham directing. It got the short shrift at the theaters, but I recall going back with my sister to see it several times. Even at 17 years old, this movie did ....something...to me. It still does and I am glad to own it now on DVD. I have a soft spot for the tragic, charming vampire (Chris Sarandon in Fright Night comes readily to mind), and this fills the bill. <br /> <br />A few detractors: Purists will always find something to criticize in every telling of the vampire story simply because the legend is so fraught with differing rules, etc. But there are a few that are inarguable....Vampires DO NOT cast a reflection. John Badham says he had to leave in a reflection scene because it was a cool shot: Nope...it's just distracting, John. Also, I feel the ending left something to be desired (the \\"kite\\" flying away)...but that may be just my personal bias showing. <br /> <br />In all, this far outdoes the Coppola version.  <br /> <br />I'm leaving my windowUNlocked..... <br /> <br />
B000001FO4|5.0|great Cinderella album, i hope they tour this fall!
6305922756|2.0|I was excited to watch this movie but was a little dissapointed because I expected it to be extremely funny.There are at least two memorable scenes but thats it.Rent this movie first.Waiting for Guffman is a lot funnier (though not from the exact same people behind Spinal Tap) though heartbreaking.
B000002L7R|5.0|I am a huge Prince fan and this is without a doubt his best album. The only albums that come close are Graffiti Bridge or The New Power Generation albums. This is Prince at his best with the greatest Prince songs ever \\"Temptation and Paisley Park\\". This album can't be touched. Buy this and then buy Graffiti bridge and then The New Power Generation albums. Kick ASS and Enjoy.
B000001ESP|5.0|This is Rush's greatest album ever. I am a huge fan of Rush, but being a guitar player myself, never really liked Alex Lifesons guitar style until this Album. In \\"YYZ\\" I could pick out some things that I would say influenced Steve Vai's guitar playing. Everything about this album is absolutely amazing, i could listen to it on repeat for a month, and ask for more. I would say that this IS a good place to start, if you are a Rush fan, this is definitly the pinnacle of Rush's career, its at the exact point where their sound had been polished enough, to be called origional (unlike RUSH which was a Zeppelin copy 100%), but not so defined that it wasn't prog. From here on out, its crap, i can't even listen to signals, or test for echo, with out thinking that alien clones came down from mars, gagged the real rush, and and wrote the albums after this one. Besides everything from the '80s sucked anyway, so they have an excuse. Everything except for   Guns N Roses, Van Halen, and The Cars. Oh yeah, and Oingo Boingo too, they rock.
1592400876|3.0|Well, I must admit to some disappointment with this book...let me explain.<br /><br />This book came highly recommended by  bookstore personnel and after reading the reviews on the dust cover and at amazon.com  I decided to buy it.<br /><br />While initially, I found the book humorous with its typical British style of dry wit, I soon became aware of an impending sense of deja vu. I found myself returning to thoughts of those early and dreaded grammar school lessons (at which I did very poorly) From thereon the book became tedious and difficult to read and enjoy. I was back in school and this book was really  a teaching manual; something to be studied and learned, i.e work. I could not finish it.<br /><br />The other interesting thing was that two friends who saw this book sitting on the table and borrowed it, ended up with the same impression as I did. (and the same unfinished result)<br /><br />Obviously, some people loved this book (see other reviews) but it was not what I was looking for.
1577314808|5.0|As a scientist, I am generally very critical about spiritual books. This book has, however, the BEST sound-to-noise ratio I have come across in this field.    Speaking from experience, the dis-identification with thoughts -- which is at the core of the author's preaching -- is very easy to recognize in meditation. We are in fact the awareness that experiences thoughts. Deepening and perfecting this dis-identification, to the best of my understanding, is the process of entering the Samadhi state. Samadhi is the consciousness component in enlightenment, although full enlightenment also consists of both neurological and emotional \\"upgrades\\". These are done through raising the \\"Kundalini energy\\". Tolle does not address this issue.    Reading Tolle's firsthand account of the profound Samadhi experience is VERY inspiring. It is the BEST description I have read of the next step in human consciousness. So few have gone there, we are truly privileged to have such an eloquent rendering. This just goes to show how better this state is than what the rest of us are experiencing. This book will blow you away.    My thoughts about Tolle's teachings with respect to the implications of the Samadhi experience on everyday life are mixed. While I found the part on relationships extremely well thought out, I must say I regard terms such as 'the collective human psyche' with some suspicion.    The book does NOT cater to readers of all persuasions, since it assumes the existence of God. I recommend the classic book \\"The Origin of Consciousness\\" by Julian Jaynes for a slightly more scientific take on this issue. 30 years after its publication, Jaynes' theory is beginning to take empirical shape e.g. the article compilation \\"Neurotheology\\".    There is no suggestion as to how to approach the Samadhi state. I understand this might be covered in the follow-up book (?).    I recommend practicing Siddha Samadhi Yoga ([...]) as a formal training methodology for reaching Samadhi. The 3-week course is mostly available in India but it is a fairly easy practice. I'm told that following the course, Samadhi takes only a few months to reach.    I recommend the book 'Theories of the Chakras' by Hiroshi Motoyama for the best-practices take on the significantly more difficult issue of raising the \\"Kundalini energy\\" (whatever that \\"energy\\" may be). Since meditation comprises the bulk of the Chakra awakening practices, this process should only pose a moderate challenge for established Samadhi meditators. For ordinary folks it can concievably take years, so I recommend to approach this issue only after you are in Samadhi.    A clear 5 stars. An important book. Outstanding.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|God I love this soundtrack. The mix of strings & japanese instruments is breathtaking. Whenever I watch movies - I rarely sit and listen to the score - but I couldn't help it during my first viewing.  Hans Zimmer's score left me awestruck. I put it on before i go to sleep, and sleep like a little japanese samurai baby. Amazing in every aspect.
B000683VI4|5.0|Honestly, this is one of the best films I've ever seen....regardless of the genre. My friend and I went to see this in the theater, both of us skeptical due to the \\"chick flick\\" label. I was blown away by the movie and even my friend enjoyed it who hates so called \\"chick flicks.\\" <br /> <br />The film revolves around an elderly man reading to his dimentia-striken wife from a notebook about the way they met and fell in love. Yes, I know. It sounds corny, but is anything but. The movie was extremely well acted by both the younger versions of Noah and Allie and the older versions. \\"The Notebook\\" is also one of the saddest films I've ever seen and will have even the stoniest person crying. Beware the ending....it'll have you grief-striken for days...or at least a few minutes. ;)
B00006RG9K|5.0|First, Genesis released The way we Walk - Volume I: the Shorts and The way we Walk - Volume II: the Longs, great live discs from the trio era. Now, they got both sides together, resulting in a fine concert, but unfortunately, the last one with Collins, so, it's worth for the great, excellent concert and the historical document of a band in top form playing their pop songs and their progressive pieces, both from the 70's and from the 80's. The Old Medley stuff simply rocks!!! Classics like Dance On A Volcano, The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, The Musical Box, Firth Of Fifh, I Know What I Like, Follow You Follow Me, Illegal Alien, That's All, all together in an outstanding medley!! They also plays Driving The Last Spike, Fading Lights, Domino and Home By The Sea. The pop songs goes from Land Of Confusion, Turn It On Again, Invisible Touch through I Can't Dance, No Son Of Mine, Hold On My Heart, resuming, a fine concert (seems too repetitive, but it's true) that you can't miss in your collection, a real good looking in a fine moment from one of the best bands of the world!
B0002S94OS|5.0|well, first off i would like to say that i am a huge metal fan.  well, music in general, but metal is by far my favorite.  my favorite metal is probably 80's metal for sure.  but i do like some fear factory, some korn, some deftones, and i would have to say that lamb of god is possibly the most intense metal band to ever come out of the western hemisphere.  if you like the rhythms and overall intensity of scandinavian black metal, but dont really like all the dungeons and dragons/fantasy/macabre lyrics and majestic vocals, then you would really like this album.  this has some of the coolest and most intricate riffs ive ever heard, and some pretty sick lead work on it too.  a lot more so than the last album.  overall, this is one of the best metal albums ive ever heard.  lamb of god has slowly become one of my favorite bands since i got this album.
B00005JKCH|5.0|In 2002, theater audiences were treated to what is arguably one of the best superhero-inspired films of all time, \\"Spider-Man\\", based upon the very popular superhero character created by Marvel Comics.  Directed by Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire was very-well casted to play the shy Peter Parker, turned superhero via a bite from a genetically-enhanced spider.  A high school teenager working as a photographer for his high school newspaper, Peter and his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), who is the son of the wealthy industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), travel to a laboratory/museum as part of a science class outing.  Trying to gain the attention of the girl upon whom he has had a long-time crush, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), Peter encourages Harry to talk with Mary Jane.  A missing genetically-altered spider then unexpectedly bites Peter while Harry (instead of trying to get Mary Jane to talk with Peter) starts to take an interest in Mary Jane for himself.  Returning home not feeling well, Peter begins to undergo some changes from the spider bite while Norman Osborn, in an attempt to save a multi-billion dollar government contract for his company, makes the ill-advised decision to undergo a military biochemical experiment upon himself.  Peter discovers his spider-enhanced physical abilities, while Norman Osborn develops a power-hungry alter ego in the form of the Green Goblin.  After graduation, Peter, Harry and Mary Jane seemingly go their separate ways, but the untimely death of Peter's Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) spurs him to become the crime-fighting superhero Spider-Man in time to fight the unscrupulous Green Goblin.<br /><br />With dazzling special effects, good acting and a well-written script, \\"Spider-Man\\" became an overnight box-office hit earning a record opening-weekend audience.  Tobey Maguire effectively brought to the big-screen the tragic hero figure epitomized by Spider-Man/Peter Parker, as did Kirsten Dunst portray the troubled teenaged girl next door.  Memorable scenes include the school bus, the outing, Norman's lab, Peter practicing, Uncle Ben's last night, the street party, Aunt May's (Rosemary Harris) frightful night, and the battles between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin. Overall, I rate the 2002 \\"Spider-Man\\" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to any fantasy/superhero aficionado.d girl next door.

B000002AE3|5.0|I was a huge fan of Toto during the 80s (Fahrenheit is one of my favorite albums of all time).  By the time Past to Present came out, I was a little discouraged by the band.  Gone was the fantastic Joseph Williams to be replaced by some high-pitched guy (Byron) who didn't fit the band at all.  Fortunately, the band felt the same (pick up Toto XX to hear Coming Home, the Bobby Kimball tune the guys wanted to use as a single from Past to Present)and Byron was gone for the next album. But Williams didn't come back, rather Steve Lukather took over vocals on Kingdom of Desire.  Kingdom of Desire was a good album, but a little heavier than what I expected from Toto.  I'd essentially decided to give up on Toto after Kingdom of Desire. <br /> <br />Not long after Tambu's release, I found it at a used CD store in a bin for a few bucks.  I figured what did I have to lose?  Imagine my surprise to discover this gem.  Lukather still helmed the ship, but the heavy emphasis of Kingdom of Desire had made way for a return to what I considered Toto's sound.  Tambu has some of the best Toto songs ever recorded. Period.  I Will Remember You, Just Can't Get to You, and The Road Goes On are absolutely beautiful.  <br /> <br />In summary, Tambu got me back on the Toto ship and I've been on board ever since.  Check out Mindfields for the return of Bobby Kimball and the band's new cover album, Through the Looking Glass.
0743216458|5.0|I've read several very good books on WWII, each of them contain a certain amount of blood and guts, the bloodier the better I guess.  This book is different, yes it does have blood and guts and violence but that is the side story.  The real story is about the men of Easy Company, especially Major Winters.  All of the officers had unique characteristics, Nixon, Speirs and even Sobel.  The NCO's and enlisted men truly lived as as \\"Band of Brothers\\".  The part where Speirs confronts the man who just shot Sgt. Grant is especially a powerful read.  As an American I felt very proud that these men sought to free Germany from a maniac (we still have despot maniac's today around the world).  The book and the miniseries are awesome.  Read the story of the men of Easy Company, you will feel proud.
B000002GYI|5.0|This album proves just what the visionaries of Electronic music set in motion, a Tale of Change that has truly changed the face of music as I see it. A lot of bands turned to Kraftwerk. This album is total ear candy with a good mix of melodies (not in the form of vocals, but in the form of synthesizers), beat and inginuity as well as creativity. To me, this is by far one of their best albums. I highly recommend it.
B000002H97|3.0|It wasn't their 1st album and it was far from the best.  it was good but if u want good metallica try \\"Ride the Lightning\\" or \\"and justice\\".  Remember:  Just because its self-titled doesn't mean it was their 1st.  Th@'s all.
B000001EPB|5.0|Irish dancing the way it was meant to be heard and music to soothe the leprechaun out of his gold.  While \\"Riverdance\\" is the definitive Irish dancing show, Michael Flatley (who showed up to battle Bill Gates on \\"Celebrity Deathmatch\\") has the spirit of Erin in his soul and his sole.
B0000028UK|5.0|Firstly, I should say that I think the 90's was an inspirational time to get into music. \\"Grunge\\" as it was vaguely known, was the most passionate music since punk, and at its' forefront was Pearl Jam. Creating the best debut of the 1990's in \\"Ten\\", they had a very hard act to follow. While I love \\"Ten\\" and still believe it to be the most impressive debut of the last 20 years, \\"Vs.\\" improves upon it in just about every way. Vedder's vocals are truly impassioned and strong, the music is a lot more varied (being both rawer and more acoustic).  The first two songs, \\"Go\\" and \\"Animal\\" are just about the most driven songs Pearl Jam ever laid down, combining agitated riffs with rock-solid rhythm and soaring vocals. The intension of both is never out of view. Thirdly, the tragic but beautifully executed acoustic flow of \\"Daughter\\" provides one of Pearl Jam's most poignant songs. The lyrics are special in this song and what has always impressed me about Vedder is most evident here... His vocal performance always mirrors the lyrical intent. If you listen to the way that he sings the lines \\"She holds the hand, that holds her down, she will... rise above\\" the hairs will stand to attention.   Following \\"Daughter\\" is the strangely disconcerting stop-start riff of \\"Glorified G\\", a song attacking American gun-culture and machismo. The soaring anthem, \\"Dissident\\" is probably the most mainstream song on the album, but the broken voice of Vedder with the opening lines \\"She nursed him there, overnight, wasn't so sure if she wanted him to stay... what to say, what to say?\\", added to the monsterous chorus is just the single most perfect slice of anthemic rock this side of \\"Alive\\" and \\"Even Flow\\".   The rhythmic tribal drumming and atmosphere of W.M.A is contained but lively and is another monsterous song to finish the first half of the album.  \\"Blood\\" opens the second half with the heaviest song the band has ever written... If I'm honest, it's not of the same standard as the rest of thealbum, but given the fact that that standard is quite so high, it's certainly forgiveable.   \\"Rearviewmirror\\" is one of their best 10 songs and the metaphor of the drive is echoed perfectly in the feel of the song. One of the major reasons for the albums mood is undoubtedly Abruzzese's superb drumming. As a drummer I was always in awe of his ability to fuel a song and this is the perfect Pearl Jam album to demonstrate this (of course, the only other album he played on was \\"Vitalogy\\", so that's probably not saying much. Anyone who has felt anger following a break-up or even the end of a friendship will feel the vitriol in one of the last build ups of the song... \\"Saw things, Saw things, Saw things... clearer, clearer, once you were in my rearviewmirror. It's a stunningly evocative metaphor and one of Vedder's best moments and performances.  \\"Rats\\" follows the anthemic mood on.. another of Vedder's greatest vocal performances. \\"Elderly Woman...\\" is the mirror acoustic image of \\"Daughter\\", one of the most accessible songs they've written and certainly one of the best. Stunning. Following this is the hard rock \\"Wah-Wah\\" of \\"Leash\\" and the anger in the lyrics (another amazing song) is palpable. Finally, comes the eerily atmospheric \\"Indifference\\", a beautiful album closer, very much in the same mould of \\"Release\\" off \\"Ten\\".    The one thing that always gets me is that of the songs on this album, about 7 always make it onto my \\"BestOf\\" compilations, far more than any of their other albums. The mood is SO consistent on this album, and the execution SO perfect that I really am hard pressed to find a fault with it. The production is truly exceptional... imbuing everything Pearl Jam ever wanted to be I feel... Raw and impassioned but clear and crisp: the perfect combination. Add to all this the performances: Vedder's best 5 (at least) vocal performances are on this album, Gossard's riffs are very much at their peak, McCready's lead work is unparalleled in any 90's album, Ament's bass is impressively versatile and as I said previously, Abruzzese's drumming is simply perfect.     To me, given the albums that were released around the time (Nevermind, Superunknown etc) the public was spoiled for choice. The best of all grunge albums is, without doubt, Vs. I can't find an album from the era which characterised anger, pain, grief and beauty with more inspired execution and intent. Nevermind was too polished and the lyrics were often impenetrable... Superunknown was too sludgey, bt Vs. was the perfect blend of every style of rock, inflected with Vedder's stunning melodic sensibilities. I often listen to this album just to appreciate what a milestone it really was. It still is. There hasn't been a better rock album released since in my opinion, and I'm no Pearl Jam freak... I can be equally critical, especially of their later works (What happened on Binaural, anyone?). Indeed, their later works have badly lacked the consistency that was epitomised on this album, and while they were very good indeed... this is perfect.

They simply broke the lines with the real world and literally decided to navigate in the great madness universe and nothing else seems concern .<br /><br />The helicopter attack over the population is simply merciless and the level of inhumanity simply has gone a long time ago due they crossed the barrier between the common sense and the laws of war : to exterminate the enemy , no matter how ; and this orders have become in their live stylish , the time and the moral considerations have been relegated to a  second priority , it's just a game an imitation of a cat and mouse game .<br /><br />Duvall has never been best  in any previous or next role like this one .<br /><br />Willard nevertheless must to follow the orders ; try to find Wurtz in the middle of the jungle or the hell . You have to realize the river and the sea according the mythical language  mean the life . And the life has in itself much more imagination than all of all us .<br /><br />This clever device was previously use for Herzog in Aguirre the wart of God and next in Fitzcarraldo (see my reviews about both films)<br /><br />In this sense all the events we will watch through the river are not more than the shadows and the fortuity that the life present us . In this sense the journey is very close related to the Dante's hell in the Divine Comedy , where you know the suffering also cries .<br /><br />The loneliness , the anguish, desperation and hopeless dictate their rules and once you have crossed the line if you are not a centered man in what the essential values concern , you have switched another bottom and decided to build another world .<br /><br />The final dialogue with Kurtz in middle of a excellent shadow light game lights is made with the supreme perfection . You have to live with the horror and befriend with it are tone the lines in Wurtz speech , the borderline has been surpassed and what other considerations still remain  in its real dimension .<br /><br />Wurtz supported for the horror existential made his own rules and in the middle of the jungle only the strong survives , so the law concerns more with the surviving concepts than any other law .<br /><br />This confession leaves no other choice , he knows that a possible trail out of this hell has no sense and Kurtz must die in his new world.<br /><br />The conclusion is evident : the job has been done but what about the insanity concerns you have left in the middle of the soul and the mind of these men whose mental illness are still worst than all the murdered made by Kurtz<br /><br />Marlon Brando made one of his top performances in his career. Hopper as the photographer is superb too , but I have certain discrepancies with his character . I 'd rather a stronger character to face and answer to Brando the other side of the dilemma and I think in three options which would have worked out as perfect counter balance : Clift Robertson , Jon Voight or Maximilian Schell .<br /><br />Coppola is perfect with this anthological and emblematic movie . He made the most powerful film about the poetic meaning of what Vietnam became  .<br /><br />And I underline the adjective poetic , and not prose , due the fact the poetry and the myth are twins . And the prose is even vulgar to describe the real dimensions about the multiple complexities of this special war .<br /><br />Please try to acquire the uncut version and you will make the entire round to this sublime masterpiece. Otherwise the film will look like with too many holes to build the puzzle .<br /><br />A sublime masterpiece!masterpiece. Otherwise the film will look like with too many holes to build the puzzle . <br />A sublime masterpiece! <br /> <br />
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Contrary to what some people say, this is a solid release from Ms. Lavigne. Her writing has matured immensley from the last release and her vocals are also better than the last disc too. For her songs being mainly about love and heart ache, she wrote them extremely well. The most \\"punk\\" song on here is He Wasn't and I admit that that song is horrendous, she doesn't pull off those kind of songs very well at all. Although, the harder hitting songs are done very well, her vocals seem to compliment those kind of songs nicely. Another thing I found interesting is the diversity this album has, it takes you from rock to \\"punk\\" to pop to pop rock, not many cds have that kind of diversity anymore. The thing about this cd that keeps me coming back for more is that it is the kind of cd where the songs get implanted into your brain and you can't get them out no matter how hard you try.<br /><br />A few of the best songs on here are Take Me Away, How Does It Feel, Nobody's Home, and Forgotten. But like I said earlier, it's the diversity that drew me to this cd, it's not the type of cd I expected her to make. For that reason alone I reccommend this cd, but if that isn't good enough, her vocals are amazing in my opinion. This release is definitely a big step up from the last disc.
0743454529|4.0|Guaranteed to tug at even the hardest heartstrings, Jodi Piccoult's most recent novel, My Sister's Keeper, is guaranteed to leave you bawling, gasping for air, and questioning your own morals and ethics.  How far should a family go to save a child? What if it means infringing on the rights of another? Piccoult spins an intriguing and controversial web of family dynamic, court drama, sisterhood, personal choice, life, and death. Well-known for her ability to give light and life to controversial issues, Jody Piccoult does not disappoint. <br /> <br />   The main character and narrator, Anna Fitzgerald, is the product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis.  She was conceived as a bone marrow match to her older sister, Kate, who suffers from a rare form of leukemia. Thirteen years and numerous operations later, Anna is asked to donate a kidney for her sister. The girl decides that she is through living a life defined and controlled by her sister's condition, and she hires an attorney.  But Anna's decision to sue her parents for medical emancipation (essentially meaning the rights to her own body) could mean the death of her sister.  <br /> <br />   As the family fights the forces attempting to tear them apart, the reader is introduced to rich, intriguing, and endearing characters, each telling the story in his or her own words. A determined mother, a pyromaniac 18-year-old brother, a highly driven attorney, and a torn father all add their insights to the tale.       <br /> <br />     Piccoult widens the eyes of the reader through a tale that is at once touching, disturbing, revealing, and enlightening. Teens may notice that all the younger characters seem to act and speak like adults. Also, the ending, though heart-wrenching and shocking, is a tad disappointing compared to the controversial nature of the body of the tale. However, don't let that deter you from reading it. Picoult has experienced what disease does to a family first-hand, so her fiction rings with fresh, undiluted pain, truth, and poignancy. Don't forget the tissues and to cancel your plans for the night, because you will not be able to put this one down.  <br />
B000083C49|5.0|This is probably by far the funniest of the Star Trek motion pictures.  The crew of the Enterprise has found Spock and are trying to get home when they receive a signal from earth telling them to stay away because of the impending doom of the planet.  Of course this is how Kirk gets out of the dog house (in the previous film he disobeyed Star Fleet orders and stole a starship to look for Spock) because as we all know, he's the only one that can save the earth.  An alien probe has returned to earth to communicate with hump backed whales.  The problem is that they are extinct on the earth of the future.  Unbeknownst to the probe, its communications begin to destroy earth's atmosphere and the weather goes nuts and 100% cloud cover prevents the sun's rays from reaching the earth.   <br /> <br />So where do you get these whales for the probe to communicate with?  From earth of the past of course.  So sets the premise for the film.  The laughs are mostly due to Mr. Spock not being quite himself and also from the fact that the crew has had to return to earth of the past in a Klingon Bird of Prey (with the cloaking device). <br /> <br />Yes there is a message here.  Take care of the earth or it won't be able to take care of you! <br /> <br />Some would say the story is far fetched but it's science fiction.  It's supposed to be far fetched.  The kids will love it even if they don't know Star Trek.  There's no nudity and no real foul language.  Also you won't find much violence either.  This film is kid friendly. <br /> <br />Go ahead and purchase with confidence.  May the force be with you! (oops, wrong scifi series!!)  Live long and prosper.  Enjoy.

B00005JKHP|2.0|This film is a disappointment for avid fans of Star Trek.  I remember coming out of the theater wanting my money back.  You may recall seeing the same basic story on Star Trek when it was aired on television.  It was entitled \\"The Changling\\" and it had a similar mechanical device roaming the galaxy looking for items or beings to \\"sterilize\\" because they were imperfect.  We expected more when Star Trek, The Motion Picture (or Star Trek-The Motion Sickness as my family calls it) was finally released.    <br /> <br />All that being said, viewing it now and having put some distance from the first time seeing it, it has taken on a certain charm of its own.  I suppose that's because we are now able to watch it with a certain amount of nostalgia and fondness.  Also, Star Trek - The Wrath of Kahn more than made up for the release of TMP.  All has been forgiven.   <br /> <br />You may just want to have this movie in your library for the sake of posterity if not for the love of it.  It's not wonderful but still, a serious Star Trek fan should have it in his/her collection even if they never watch it.  Even if just to remind you of days gone by.  We Star Trek fans are apt to be more critical than anyone else since we grew up with it and know the original t.v. episodes by heart.   <br /> <br />Hopefully, most of the more eccentric fans have moved out of their parents basements, gotten jobs, families, etc. and don't necessarily live their lives according to the gospel of Gene Roddenberry (no disrepct intended).   <br /> <br />Just try to enjoy this film for what it is, entertainnment, not at its best, but entertainment nonetheless.
038551123X|5.0|Dexter is the kind of guy you would laugh with at the office water cooler, and scream about when you realize too late that he's your worst nightmare -- if you're a serial killer yourself, that is, and therefore subject to his gruesome curiosity. But what makes this book's \\"protagonist\\" so appealing is his delicious inner dialog -- with himself and his \\"dark passenger.\\" Selfish, pragmatic, brilliant, and deadly, Dexter is James Bond with even less conscience; a hysterically clueless ingenue in the world of people, and a ruthlessly capable monster in the world of silence and shadows. The story is every bit as carefully crafted as Dexter's meticulous compulsions. A great read from cover to cover.
B0000683DH|5.0|This is the movie that the Star Trek motion pictures should have started with.  It was a perfect place to pick up and continue a story line.  After all, Kirk has more enemies than all the tribbles in the galaxy.  There is plenty of action alongside comedy relief.  And yes, the uniforms are much better in this film than in TMP! <br /> <br />Even if you've never watched an episode of Star Trek you will be able to follow the story well.  This is a must have for Star Trek fans of all ages.  Montalban gives an excellent performance even though quite a few years have gone by since he orignated his role and he's obviously kept himself in good shape despite his chronic back problems. <br /> <br />The acting is much better here than TMP.  Everyone actually looks as if they are glad to be on the set.  And why shouldn't they be?  One little t.v. show has brought them more dough than they ever thought they'd see.   <br /> <br />You'll enjoy this one.  Live long and prosper!!
B0000DYJM6|5.0|At the peak of the 90s alt-rock scene, Pearl Jam was the biggest band in the world. Nirvana may have kick-started their fame, but \\"Ten\\" climbed the charts quicker and higher than \\"Nevermind\\" ever has, selling over 12 million copies (as of 2003). Pearl Jam wasn't about to compromise their music for fame and glamour, which is clear when examining their career. Although Pearl Jam had created the sound of an entire decade, they continued to duck the spotlight, by making very few videos, giving very few interviews, then enduring a long battle against Ticketmaster, that lowered their popularity a few more notches. After releasing \\"Vs.\\" in 1993, each Pearl Jam album that followed played to a smaller audience. Ultimately, Pearl Jam went from being the biggest band in the world, to being the biggest cult band in the world, by choice.<br /><br />Due to the way Pearl Jam has gone about making albums in the past, their are several \\"Lost Dogs\\" included here. Since each album plays to a small audience, and includes an underlying theme, several songs that were officially released were shelved if they did not fit in with the rest of the material, and never made it to a proper Pearl Jam album. This is why \\"Lost Dogs\\" is necessary, a compilation of their best B-sides, stray singles, and compilation tracks, laid out in non-chronological sequence.<br /><br />The variety of material is very desirable. This is Pearl Jam at their most experimental, their hardest rocking, most relaxed and most intimate in their career. \\"Lost Dogs\\" captures what the band sounded like at their peak, capturing their true passion. This proves that they had what it took to release another \\"Ten\\" album, but wisely chose not to.<br /><br />Some standouts on the first disc include \\"All Night,\\" \\"Sad,\\" \\"Down,\\" \\"Undone,\\" and the concert favorite \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\". In my opinion, the second disc is much better. It's more relaxed and chilled out. They experiment with harmonica, and other sorts of production. Standouts include \\"Fatal,\\" \\"Other Side,\\" \\"Footsteps,\\" \\"Dead Man Walking,\\" my personal favorite \\"Drifting,\\" \\"Sweet Lew,\\" and the concert favorite \\"Last Kiss\\".<br /><br />All in all, B-side and rarities compilations aren't supposed to be this good. B-sides by definition, are good and familiar, but not as good as what made the album. Pearl Jam shatters this definition, leaving the common listener in awe. I personally believe that this album is better than most of their studio albums; how refreshing.douts include \\"Fatal,\\" \\"Other Side,\\" \\"Footsteps,\\" \\"Dead Man Walking,\\" my personal favorite \\"Drifting,\\" \\"Sweet Lew,\\" and the concert favorite \\"Last Kiss\\". <br /> <br />All in all, B-side and rarities compilations aren't supposed to be this good.

B000001ELP|5.0|This concept album by Kiss is a lot better than most give it credit. From the opening fanfare to the end this a great effort. A world without heroes, I and Dark light are standouts. Rumored to have been an idea for a movie at one time, how cool Kiss meets Excalibur, too bad we never saw that. A great album by one of the best bands in the world and deservers a second look, you won't be sorry.
B00006M183|3.0|This album has alot of problems. So many i like to think of Pearl Jam before they made this album, and completely changed. I think the change can mostly be blamed on the new drummer from Soundgarden, who completely changed Pearl Jam's Sound, and not for the better. This seems more like a brand new band then Pearl Jam. In fact who is this? The lyrics are the weakest of all the Pearl Jam albums. THis dissappointed me because in my opinion Eddie Vedder is one of the most talented, ingenius writers of music ever! I don't completely blame eddie, although most of the songs he wrote get lost in politics and stray from Genuine Music, i mostly blame all the other writers. Mostly the drummer because he decided to add his pen to the mix, which diminished alot Eddie songs, leaving us with few of his words. ANother problem is the producer. I blame him the most! He changed their sound so much that The band can't even be recognized as Pearl Jam. And what the heck happened to their guitar sound. It's so weak, and modern. Sick!!!..... sorry, i puked again.<br /><br />  My advice. Get off the political bandwagon, loosen up a little, fire the drummer, bring back Jack IRons, the BEST pearl jam drummer, and try to find your sound again. to do that bring back your producer Brendan O'brien. I don't live in the past, so i'm not saying relive the 90's over and over, but the only way Pearl Jam has a future is if they use their history to their advantage.
0060512806|4.0|This book is unlike anything I've ever read.  Everything from geeky computer hackers, WWII espionage, WWII and current day cryptography.  It took me about 300 pages to really get in to it, but then I was completely captivated.  So stick in their if the going is slow at first.  It is very unpredictable with no clue as where it's going next.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because I found it difficult to keep track of all the story lines and characters at times.
B000089CJI|4.0|This amazing band has soared to such great heights with this album, that it's kind of hard to describe. I mean Geeze!!! If you've never heard it you won't believe what you're missing. This album is perfect for cool summer nights, or times when you feel inspired to be in love, but the words don't come. It's ok, all the words are said in the lyrics.<br /><br />  Talk about the lyrics. There are so many great lines on the album that it would take far to long to list them all. But let me say these guys are fantastic songwriters, and great lyricists. The voice is smooth, the music is sirious, and the album is solid. This will be gold in your collection.
B00005B36H|5.0|You either love them or you hate them. It seems there's no middle ground. Well, if you're the kind of person that likes Tool (like me) you should love this album, it really delivers. It's fun to listen to, with a dark and brooding quality and fascinating lyrical writing (something I think is true of basically everything MJK does, whether with APC or Tool). Everybody knows Schism, of course. That was the first Tool song I ever heard. There's just such an amazing, deep quality to this album that you really have to listen to it to understand. The kind of music you feel like you can just drift and sink down into while listening to it, drifting off into it's darkness. If you can enjoy rock, and enjoy an album that speeds up, slows down, and does it all while blending the songs into a big long enjoyable experience; this should be a great CD to add to your collection.

B00005AAFS|4.0|Rammetein is a hard rock band and have a lot of meaning in their songs. Sonne video is awesome. The Mutter song has great guitar rifts. Everybody should buy this CD.

B0000VD04M|5.0|I was heartbroken early last February when this DVD was recalled from stores nationwide as soon as it was released.  I didn't get one.  I was determined not to pay an inflated price for this DVD from an online auction.  I decided to just wait-it-out until it finally would be released.  That day has come.  It was worth the wait. I love Tim Burton's movies, that is, all but two.  \\"Ed Wood\\" is near the top of my list.  I think this DVD is just about close to perfect.  I can't think of anything wrong here.<br /><br />If you only ever see one actual movie made by Ed Wood, make it \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\", which is readily available on DVD.
B00005JNJ7|4.0|South Park creators Parker and Stone have outdone themselves with this puppet show inspired in it's appearance by the wonderful Gerry Anderson \\"Supermarionation\\" TV show from the 1960's, Thunderbirds (available on DVD if you've never seen it). However, beyond the puppets and model aircraft, this show is nothing like a Gerry Anderson kids' show. The humor ranges from making fun of poor quality movies and bad acting to slamming extreme political views on both the right and left, and does a great job throughout the entire range.<br /><br />The only flaws in this film seem to come in the same area that is a problem in some episodes of South Park, which is that there is no self-restraint at all and some jokes are just crude or gross without being particularly clever or funny. However, those few scenes that left me and the rest of the audience cringing or silent were far outweighed by the ones where we laughed very loudly and for quite some time. Examples of some great moments are:<br /><br /> -A whole song devoted to how bad the film Pearl Harbor was, how it missed the significance of that tragic event, and what a mediocre actor is Ben Affleck.<br /><br /> - The awkardness of the puppets. Gerry Anderson used to go to great lengths to hide how funny it looked when the puppets walked, but Parker and Stone closely show you just how awkward the puppets are when walking and doing other human activities (e.g., having sex), to great comic effect.<br /><br /> - Team America is eager to do good, but they \\"break\\" a lot of stuff doing it, often doing more damage than the bad guys they are chasing.<br /><br /> - The song during the closing credits. It's hilarious, so be sure to stay through the credits and keep your ears open.<br /><br />In spite of its flaws, this is one of the sharpest comedies to come along in a while. See it while you can or buy the DVD when it comes out. Hopefully it will have additional funny extra features. I'd love to see outtakes from this film!
B00006IU73|5.0|I was just recently turned on to PT and this is the first recording I have ever owned from them. FINALLY a newer \\"progressive\\" rock band with something fresh to offer besides Rick Wakeman like keyboard noodlings, guitar scale etudes, or odd time signature drum beats just because... Not only do they live up to being labeled a prog rock band, they also obliterate the mold on some levels. Although most of the songs are guitar driven, the tunes still have a lot of depth and dynamics. This album is a bit of a departure from their earlier, more self indulgent explorations, but will still soothe your brain while filling your shoes with nitrous. Take this album on a long drive or just veg to it with a lava lamp... There's a lot of great sounds and some very memorable vocal lines as well. I dig this band and I look forward to hearing more of them.
0553577123|5.0|Anne Frank's \\"The Diary of a Young Girl,\\" provides an interesting account of life under the Nazi rulling during World War II. Anne's family, together with another family went into hiding at Anne's father old office building. In her diary, Anne detailed how their daily lives were and the fear that they had of the Nazi discovering their \\"Secret Annex\\" as they called it. Anne's meticulate observation of everyone was clearly noted in her diary which provided insights into how difficult their lives were, especially since they were constantly in arguments, which were unavoidable due to the fact that eight people were living together in a confined space.<br /><br />I truly enjoy this book as it gives a different perspective of life under the Nazi. Not to mention, observations coming from a fifteen year-old was also unusual. After finished reading the book, I felt that I know Anne intimately; her personality, values and thoughts. At the end of the book, the publisher provided information on what happened to the eight people in the Secret Annex. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand how it would be like to live with eight people in a confined space for a long period of time. Truly insightful!

0792833201|5.0|Every since \\"Poltergeist\\" was released there has been debate about who influenced the final result more, Director Tobe Hooper or Producer Steven Spielberg.  I personally think the answer can be discovered by comparing Poltergeist to their previous works:  I ask you, is it closer in style to \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" or \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\"?<br /><br />All that aside, \\"Poltergeist\\" is a rippin' good ghost story.  Craig T. Nelson and Jobeth Williams play the parents of a family that unfortunately lives in one wicked suburbia haunted house. The movie develops slowly, giving us time to care about this family.  Mr. Nelson and Ms. Williams are dream parents - cool, funny, smart and devoted to the family and each other.<br /><br />The kids are pretty typical movie kids and their performances don't detract.<br /><br />Initially, there are just a few unusual and creepy goings-on.  Chairs move by themselves.  The youngest daughter, played by young Heather O'Rourke, makes out voices that come through the television late at night after everyone else has gone to sleep.<br /><br />At about the midway point of the film the owners of the \\"voices\\" start some serious shenanigans in the house and in the confusion, take little Carol Anne hostage.  You're on the edge of your seat the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Some academic ghost-buster types move in and set up cameras and recorders. Next thing you know, weird things are happening to them as well.<br /><br />Made before the CGI age, \\"Poltergeist\\" nonetheless has some impressive special effects.  The story tries to get under your skin.  It doesn't just pick one thing to be scared of.  There is no 25 foot shark or machete-wielding madman.  Instead it succeeds over and over again at creeping you out at everyday objects.  The old oak tree in the back yard becomes a menace.  Toys in the kid's room turn sinister.  The kitchen becomes a fright-hall.<br /><br />When everyday objects are suddenly turning against you, what can you do?  These are the things the family and the ghostbusters have to deal with while they try to figure out if they can get Carol Anne back.<br /><br />My first experience with \\"Poltergeist\\" wasn't watching the movie.  I was in a multiplex, next door watching something else, but through the walls WE were listening to the audience watching \\"Poltergeist\\" next door shrieking and screaming.  I know I wasn't the only person thinking \\"What in the WORLD are they WATCHING next door?\\"  We stepped out of our movie at the end to see the overhead sign.  We knew this was something we HAD to go see.<br /><br />We weren't disappointed.ave to deal with while they try to figure out if they can get Carol Anne back.

0440237688|5.0|Ever wonder how the world would be without color, history, or the ability to choose?  What if you no longer had the ability to feel pain?  Would you take that choice if it meant you also couldn't feel love or treasure past memories? <br />     In the novel The Giver, young adult author Lois Lowry brings the reader into a whole new world.  It is a world unlike anything we've ever known.  In this world, everything is fixed and Jonas, the main character, is a boy who is chosen to be the receiver for the community by the \\"Elders.\\"  This position in the community is a huge challenge for Jonas and the novel reveals his journey and struggle with this unique world. <br />    Each chapter unfolds an intricately woven plot that leaves you on the edge of your seat ready for the next chapter, which means I will not divulge much more of the plot.  One of the most enjoyable and interesting aspects of reading this novel was the element of surprise and not knowing what lied ahead.  In this case, it has been much more insightful and thought-provoking to discover the plot and themes from Lowry on my own.   <br />    The book is well written and a fairly easy read.   It is about grade 9 (according to my Fry Readability calculations), though students 12-13 and older should not have a big struggle to read this novel!  Lowry uses her writing style to captivate your attention and clearly depict exactly what is happening at that moment.  I felt like I was in the scene at times because the images were so vivid. <br />   The style and plot are intriguing, interesting, and fun, but one of the best parts about this book are the ideas that unfold behind the story. At the end of book you feel satisfied yet provoked, along with a unique mix of emotions that causes you to ponder different aspects of life you might have taken for granted. <br />    Although I think this book is a must read for everyone (though especially teens!), it is not necessarily loved by every reader.  Some passages can be alittle heavy to read at times or even a little strange to grasp and understand.  Also, some chapters moved a little more slowly than others.  But overall reading the book seemed to fly by! <br />   Whether you're a young teen or an older teen, this book is a great novel to read because of its enjoyability and uniqueness.  You're never too old to read this 179 page fast and fun fantasy adventure.  Though many classify this novel as Sci-fi, I think it crosses different genres of fiction and readers who don't normally read sci-fi or fantasy would also enjoy the book. At the very least it gives the reader much food for thought, and even challenges their perspectives or beliefs.  Any book that inspires more thought and leaves you wanting to read more is worth reading and recommending!  Published by Laurel Leaf in 1994, it's a classic that won't go out of style! <br />
B00005JMUA|5.0|As I noted in a review for Vol.1, these 2 movies were originally one movie and cut in half for time. If you think of them as one, you'll enjoy them both more.  <br />Where Vol. 1 is mostly action scenes and flashbacks; Vol. 2 deals with a much more defined storyline and the character's present situation. Another fun ride from Tarentino and definitely a must see! <br />With his usual style of the story jumping around, Vol.1 is necessary to understand & appreciate Vol.2. The ending is a shocker and pretty twisted. A GREAT FILM! and I didn't even see White Chicks. (see below review) <br />
B00008ADPF|1.0|Dear Amazon,  <br /> <br />Can we install a negative star system that goes down to say 5 billion levels?  That might get close to the how I would rate this.  I can barely contain the vomit that flows up my throat when I hear this \\"music\\" on the radio.  Seriously, dudes, do you really think you are making good music?  I would rather slide down a razor blade into a pool of iodine than listen to three seconds of this auditory misery that major labels force on us.  And you know, the completely innappropriate lyrics to whatever that song is about \\"pants around the knees\\" is just dumb-founding.  Nice work T.S. Eliot.  Seems like you spent too much time growing your immaculate facial hair instead of some character.  Geez, you guys are tools...no wait...you are the entire tool section of my local Sears.  Dear America, you are being duped.  This is the kind of music that one or two completely delusional number-crushing music hating douche-suits liked and decided to play ad-nauseum until we are all hypnotized into thinking it's awesome.  Do not fall for it!  Free your minds!  Here's the remedy.  Buy an MC5 record and your favorite yeasty beverage.  Start imbibing said liquid.        <br />Put on MC5.  You feel that tingling feeling in your    <br />heart and legs?  Good!  It's working!
B00005JMEW|5.0|I can't understand why someone who is a fan of movies wouldn't enjoy this one! If you like Martial Arts Cinema from the 70's, you'll love this, if you like Spaghetti Western's (think \\"A Fistful of Dollars\\")you'll love this, mostly- if you like NO APOLOGIES ACTION, you'll LOVE this!  <br />This is EASILY the BEST movie of the year! I loved it! The fight scenes are incredible, the cinematography and images are beautiful, and the blood and violence are done in an almost comical Tarentino style that translates well for this type of movie. This film takes you on a Fun-Wild Ride from start to finish! It's not supposed to be compared to the Godfather or Seven or whatever. It's not dark and brooding, it's in your face, good, dirty, fun! <br />BE WARNED: Kill Bill vol. 1 & 2 were originally ONE movie. They were basically cut in half shortly before it hit theatres.  <br />So, the ending does seem abrupt. But watch volume 2 also and you won't be disappointed!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Imposing Tokyo is a city of too much crowded streets and too much empty ones.  Down town surrounded by everlasting lights and continuous movement on every sighting, everyone follows their own path. I suppose after a while living here, you take everything for granted. It may become tedious. Its overwhelming technology constituted and penetrates every skyscraper and advertisement. A night stroll through this marvelous city aside a love one can picture perfect how intimacy can be achieved by huge surroundings of people and endless movement. Why? Romantic love between a man and a woman is a constant of two, a third one means crowd. So, this two are immerse on each other enjoying this touring through Tokyo. The strolling goes on as the characters talk, laugh, and fool around each other. Simple mundane seduction, the unique of it is in the difference of each others persona. In their sorrow and meaningless existence they are aware of this mundane stroll. They fall in love, no longer mundane but unique. Now they are Bob and Charlotte, not that lone Wife and the depressive Actor, what ever his name is (Bob Harris isn't it?). More strolling as the couple gaze at that Big Pink Dinosaur. Some jokes here and there, when at last they understand that they are alone with each other. That's all the comfort one needs. Still surrounded by massive amounts of people strolling through the streets (got the picture?).   To cheer you up, to hold you save, still strolling through Tokyo and its overwhelming architecture, the couple feels the bond. What a great time to be with each other! Bond together. Time for a Whisky. Cheers!   Wake up, it's late already! Got to work. Where is my Husband? That damn Translator sucks big time! Some fancy actress, I just can't stand her stupid smile! At least I'm getting paid for this commercial. At least there is Tokyo right outside the window. Tonight's plan will take us to one of those popular bars where you can be alone with your friends and have a good time. Karaoke! Now I know you better. I don't want to be alone tonight, so stay with me please? We'll share the sorrow. It's about the dept of your gaze and the sharing of our silence. It pleases me to be with you. Bob and Charlotte. Yours truly!   Don't feel sad, we'll come together again. Now Charlotte strolls alone in Tokyo, and Bob impatiently awaits for her to come back to America. Then we'll sketch a dinner or something and begin an affair. Remember the way we where back in Tokyo?   No stereotypes, no clichs, and by no means the standard romantic comedy formula is used in any to way to cheapens this carefully constructed atmosphere of lonesome existences and frailty of the soul. Reality is at every moment present to express a direct mood of despair. Sweet jokes and mundane speeches, just a man a woman coming together as in real life happens. That's why it's simple but sober script penetrates the viewer with gallantly and emotiveness. Never in this picture a glimpse of hypocrite manipulation is seen to force a tear in the spectator. Sophia Coppola's pace and cinematic composure is perfect and flawless. The acting level is simply splendid. Highly in shape, Bill Murray is the perfect muse, natural, complex, as far as I am concern, this is no acting but a real life person caught in motion. Tender Scarlett Johansson pleases the eye with every gesture and word, sexy and lone, a breathtaking performance my dear. The photography is no post-card but a realistic color depict of the great Tokyo gathered with an exact camera movement. Music to assists the images and increase the great balance achieved in this less that 30 days shooting. A.K.A.: Lost in Translation.   And so, the excellent DVD transferring offers DTS sound, Dolby Digital 5.1, A conversation with Sophia and Bill, the Making Of, an extend version of that weird Japanese T.V Show, plus some more goodies.   The climax comes when Bob soft spokes some words to Charlotte, gaining an instant smile on her face. That's one of the best depictions of hope ever caught in Cinema History. He comes back to the limousine with a big sense of fulfillment. She continues her stroll, alone yes, but with a huge gaze of happiness and satisfaction. Simply an unprecedented kind of beauty never shown before on the big screen. Then the end credits appear: Directed by the great Sophia Coppola, featuring the amazing performances of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, etc, etc.   It's about people we met briefly in our lives, but how we can talk about them forever, and never get tire of it.
B00009ATIX|1.0|I love all types of movies but, let's call this like we see it ok? <br />This has GOT to be one of the most boring movies I have ever seen in my life.  <br />It seems as though the director was trying to copy a Stanley Kubrick style film and most assuredly DID NOT accomplish this. <br />The story made no sense and had no resolution! TERRIBLE. <br />Buy this if you have trouble going to sleep at night because believe me, it will put you RIGHT OUT.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Splendid piece of work.  I will not tell you about this movie, except to say -  WATCH IT AND LAUGH YOUR HEAD OFF.
6304539258|5.0|<br />SPOILERS AHEAD! <br /> <br />I first saw \\"Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\\" when I was five years old. The final release of the original tapes had just been released, and my dad was quick to buy the box set. And as I watched the very first shot of the Star Destroyer chasing the Tantive IV, I was drawn in right away. The action, the characters, the plot... I could go on for days. It was the best movie I had seen in all of my limited years. And even now, eleven years later, the Star Wars Trilogy still holds a place in my heart as the best movies ever.   <br /> <br />Two years later, Lucas gave his loyal fans a mixed bag from the Mall of America. He decided to release these classic films again in theaters - where they were always meant to be - but they weren't really the same anymore. You see (and you should if you are reading this), the movies that were released were what was known to Lucas as \\"Special Editions\\". These movies included enhanced special effects, new special effects shots, enhanced THX sound, and even some new scenes! This got a mostly bad reaction. Most fans were outraged at Lucas for tampering with their childhood in such a way. I suppose that, to those truly dedicated fans, this would be considered blasphemy. But these are George's movies, after all, and he can do what he wants with them (for my full speech on this matter, see my review of the \\"Star Wars Trilogy DVD'S\\"). <br /> <br />In this review, I am going to cover all of the changes that George has made to the first movie in the trilogy, \\"A New Hope\\", and give them ratings. Enjoy. <br /> <br />----- <br /> <br />CHANGE 1 - Ride'um, Stormies.  <br /> <br />The first major change occurs when the Stormtroopers are searching for the Death Star plans on Tatooine. Many new shots have been added of Stormtroopers riding on creatures known as Dewbacks (large, brown, lizard-like creatures). These new creations look cool all right, and they even manage to make the stormtroopers look realistic while riding on them. Overall, good job, George. <br /> <br />RATING: A <br /> <br />----- <br /> <br />CHANGE 2 - Got Danger? Not Anymore.  <br /> <br />The first major change in the movie was the look of Mos Eisly. As the group of heroes enter the spaceport, several more shots are seen of a bustling town. These new shots include floating droids, dewbacks, and even a droid whacking another droid as it laughs at him. Unfortunately, these new changes dum down the seriousness of the moment, as they make the town seem more like a child's fantasy than a place crowded with the worst criminals in the galaxy.  <br /> <br />RATING: C+  <br /> <br />----- <br /> <br />CHANGE 3 - Pointblank Miss <br /> <br />The most infamous change made to \\"A New Hope\\", as well as the one most griped about by fans, is the fact that when Han meets Greedo in the cantina, Greedo now shoots at Han first, misses, and THEN gets blasted by Han. This was a very bad edit by George, even though he does explain that he did it so that Han wouldn't seem like a murderer. First of all, Greedo shooting at pointblank range, and missing Han just isn't good ju-ju (hence the title). Second, Han dodging the blast looked like crap, as his head only moved jerkily to the side. Bad Lucas, Bad!  <br /> <br />RATING - D <br /> <br />----- <br /> <br />CHANGE 4 - Freaky Jabba <br /> <br />Another noticeable change was that a new scene was added after Luke and Obi-Wan left the cantina. This new scene comprised of Jabba the Hutt and Han talking about Han's debt in great depth (bad pun). All I can say about this is... God help us all. From what Lucas has said, this was a scene that was intended for the original version, but because of costs and the fact that effects weren't as advanced back then, it got cut. But putting it back in was a bad move by Lucas and the ILM company. First of all, the scene mostly repeats the dialog and main idea from the Greedo scene, and this makes it a little boring. Second of all, umm... what happened to Jabba? In \\"Return of the Jedi\\", he was a fearsome spectacle of slug. And even though he has not fully reached adulthood in this movie, that is no excuse for the job that was done on him. Jabba now looks like a pale frog with huge eyes, and an expression that clearly states, \\"Why am I here? Why didn't I go to Florida instead?\\". He hardly reacts at all to Han's actions and dialog, and overall looks like a piece of sh--- um, crap.  <br /> <br />NOTE: The hilarity rating counts as how much I laughed at how crappy the scene was.  <br /> <br />HILARITY RATING: A <br />RATING: E <br /> <br />----- <br /> <br />CHANGE 5 - Ummmm... Do I Know You? <br /> <br />Another change came when Luke and the other Yavin pilots were preparing for their attack on the Death Star. As Luke is getting ready, he is suddenly greeted by his old friend, Biggs. The two men have a loving conversation, and then get back to their business. On this scene, just look at the title. Luke only mentions Biggs once in the movie, and this is a passing phrase. <br /> <br />LUKE: \\"Ah, Biggs is right, I'm never gonna' get out of here!\\" <br />Perhaps if we had a little more background on Biggs, we would have appreciated this scene more. <br /> <br />RATING: C- <br /> <br />----- <br /> <br />CHANGE 6 - Five More Minutes, please! <br /> <br />The final noticeable change was that in the charge on the Death Star, many new special effect shots have been added, including a shot of the Tie Fighter on one of the fighter's tail shooting him from behind, and a new and improved dive on the station. These new shots vastly improve the quality of the battle, and help to improve the tension of the situation. Yay, George! <br /> <br />RATING: A+ <br /> <br />----- <br /> <br />OVERALL CHANGES RATING: C- <br />  <br />
B000002OZY|5.0|The Who made their debut with this album which is definitely something any music lover should own...but their sound matured with time and the release of Quadrophenia, their second rock opera, proves that...worth checking out for anyone who enjoyed Tommy.
B00005JMXX|2.0|Truly boring.  Some different special effects, but the same old story as any other disaster flick.  Really stupid.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Where do people get off thinking that they can call people \\"trashy\\" for liking Avril Lavigne? Have people really gotten that low? <br />I happen to like Avril Lavigne. If you want to hate on me, thats perfectly fine. Atleast im not on here trashing others for purchasing this CD. <br />Please people, grow up. Personally, I think that Avril Lavignem is extremely, extremely talented. I love most of the songs on this CD.  <br />If you dont like it, thats your oppinion. Dont call others \\"trashy\\" or \\"garbage\\" for voicing theres.
B00005JNEI|4.0|This movie incites a rift in America right down party lines. While Farenheit 9/11 is loosely labeled a documentary, what people need to realize is that this is still just a movie. But just because it was cleverly edited, remember that Moore didn't fake the footage of the President at the golf course and any other footage (even though he can cut around the headlines)in the film. Of course Michael Moore plays on the public's emotions and sense of patriotism- it makes for good viewing.  <br /> <br />In the end, Moore is still just a filmaker and he did what he set out to do- make money. He may try to exploit his own political agenda, but if you don't agree with him then don't buy/see the movie, since that just supports Moore's endeavors. For all the bible-thumping conservatives to know that they hated the movie, they had to watch it (or else they should never pass judgement on it), and that's what he wanted in the first place. More tickets sold to people for the sole purpose of bashing the flick. And in the end, if you base your political affiliations and ideals on a movie anyway, then you're the one in need of change, not Michael Moore.
B0002V7ODI|4.0|Picked this up on a whim, mainly because of the good reviews.  I avoided it in the theatres because I thought the trailer looked too ridiculous, thinking this was going to be another \\"Van Helsing\\" trip to CGI hell (pun intended).  How surprising to find a movie with real heart, and, in Ron Perlman, an actor capable of projecting so much personality behind all those layers of latex and lord knows what else (though I guess I should have remembered \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" and I wouldn't have been as surprised).  He makes \\"Hellboy\\" an extremely original creation, part overgrown adolescent, part superior being, yearning for acceptance and freedom, which doesn't come easy when you look like a steroidal version of Satan.<br /><br />Many of the best parts of the film, in fact, are the more character-driven sections, where Hellboy struggles with his emotions.  In some of the recent Comic book movies, such scenes tend to feel like grafted-on attempts at making the characters more complex.  Here, the tables are turned, and the emotional arc feels as natural as in any good indie film, and the action stuff feels a bit perfunctory.<br /><br />That's the one flaw to me, as an action flick, \\"Hellboy\\" doesn't take the action part quite seriously enough.  I never felt that Hellboy was in any serious danger, also, there were no real surprise deaths among the characters.  The Spiderman and X-men films therefore have a slight (and I do mean slight) edge in the storytelling department, though \\"Hellboy\\" feels much fresher in it's approach.  It may fall slightly short of the above film series, but it is worth a hundred \\"Hulks\\" or \\"Daredevils\\".  \\"Van Helsing\\"?  Don't even go there.
B0000028RR|5.0|This is the album that started the metal/rap/rock craze that overtook 70% of rock radio you hear today, unfourtantely, rock/metal just doesn't sound good coming from any other band than Rage Against the Machine, in my opinion... so when they broke up, all we were left with was countless wannabes... <br /> <br />However this album is the most rare kind of album there is... not only was this genre-bending AND a debut album... but both politically, & musically... it was absolutely revolutionary - How many other albums in the history of music are like that? few, incredibly few... <br /> <br />Thus this proves just how important this album is in music... I'm not much of a rap fan at all, In fact, I strongly dislike rap.. & I was originally going to give this album 4 stars, but you CAN'T give an album like this 4 stars... it's too important & the overall overwhelming feeling you get from listening to it to just THINK FOR YOURSELF & take a stand is such a huge feeling... even if you dislike the rap part, OR, hell.. even the rock part, you feel apart of something BIG... <br /> <br />...Along with 'Vs' from Pearl Jam, this is the most aggressive politically charged, revolutionary mainstream album of the 90's, & only a few albums such as 'London Calling' from the Clash stand out in my mind as being this politically important... <br /> <br />...As for the music, 'Wake Up', the obvious Led Zeppelin- inspired guitar riff (listen to the song 'Kashmir') is enough to want the album... but other songs such as 'Killing In the Name', 'Bullet in the Head', 'Freedom', & 'Know Your Enemy' make the album a must-buy as far as I'm concerned <br /> <br />If you're going to only own one RATM album, this should be it... but I am looking forward to buying their other albums, as I'm sure you will too... <br /> <br />I wish more bands had the balls to take a stand against the brainwashing happening all over the world like this band did... RATM really does need to reform... <br /> <br />...Pearl Jam (RATM's partner in simular political stances) is still keeping the message strong, but if RATM came back... I know Pearl Jam & RATM could once again lead a political tag-team revolution like they did in the 90's, & just as many would listen... those 2 bands really supported each other's message, & as a hardcore Pearl Jam fan, I'd love to see a RATM reunion
B0000009S3|5.0|This is AMAZING music. This is not overproduced commercial pop-metal-emo-screamo-pseudo-smooth product. Frank Zappa wrote unique creative music which is instantly recognized as his own. This CD has complex, brilliant melodies which are sometimes polyphonic in nature followed by guitar (and other) solos which reflect how Zappa's ability to truly improvise was clearly beyond most other guitarists of that time (or anytime).  <br /> <br />It is very sophisticated rhythmically and melodically; his influences included Stravinsky, Varese, Webern, and R & B music from the Fifties. This is not jazz in the sense of Miles or Coltrane, but it is not always rock either. It's Frank Zappa music.  Peaches, Green Genes and Gumbo Variations especially have very complex melodies with many overdubbed counter melodies. Hours of repeated listening are required to really appreciate the craft, depth and beauty of this music. You can't play it once and disgard it as useless, the same way you can't play Stravinsky or Boulez and after one listening and say they aren't masterpieces. <br /> <br />Buy this music and give a chance-it could change your life.
0761957553|5.0|I use statistics for a living (I'm an empirical researcher). I've had my Ph.D. for several years now and own all of the usual stuff like the Hair book, the array of SPSS manuals, and the Tabachnik and Fidell book. Of all the books and books I've used,read, and owned this is the singly most user friendly book on the topic. If you use SPSS in your work, I promise that this will be the best forty dollars you can spend. I wish more stats books were written in this tone. The book is actually fun to read, which is the highest compliment that a stats book can get. It is also very accurate. The single downside of this book is that it lacks references to research on which its recommendations are based. This book might be too weak for statisticians but it is just perfect for those who use statistical methods, especially SPSS.  Very highly recommended.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|A great movie is one that reaches out and grabs you. The Ten Commandments, for example, may have had stupid parts, but the viewer never loses interest. It reaches out and grabs you. The same is true with the Star Wars series. You may hate them but you can never get bored with them. They reach out and grab you. <br /> <br />Lost in Translation is a movie in which you have the absolute reverse situation. You have to reach out and grab the movie if you are attempting to understand the point. You'd probably have to watch this movie several times even. This movie is NOT funny. It is NOT dramatic. It does NOT have a message. It is NOT entertaining and it is NOT even interesting.  <br /> <br />Bill Murray plays a 50 something actor in Tokyo who is on a losing streak. He meets Charlotte who is 25 years old played by 18-year-old Scarlett Johansson and the two fall in love. That's about it for the plot. Automatically, I have no sympathy for the characters since Bill Murray is old enough to be the grandfather of the girl he's supposed to fall in love with and looks utterly ridiculous, as does Scarlett Johansson. His character DESERVES to be a loser and I hoped the two lovebirds would have a SAD ending at the end of the movie.   <br /> <br />In the words of John Belushi, what ever happened to the Bill Murray I used to know??? I mean the Bill Murray who brought the house down as the funny soldier on \\"Stripes\\", the Bill Murray who played the clown who robbed the bank on \\"Quick Change\\", or the Bill Murray who made people laugh playing the mental patient who made Richard Dreyfus, the psychiatrist, a mental patient himself in \\"What About Bob\\"? Perhaps he's \\"Lost in Translation\\"! Please, somebody FIND him! <br /> <br />Even worse is this movie's style. It shifts from one pointless scene to another. All we really see are different areas of Toyko. Why make a movie? Why not just advertise Tokyo on the Travel Channel showing these scenes?  <br /> <br />Ladies and Gentlemen: This is as bad as it gets! This movie is one of the worst movies this year and is also the most overrated movie in recent memory. Sofia Coppola and company do not deserve one penny of your money. As it is, they've already been laughing at the public on their way to the bank stuffing millions of dollars they should NOT have received into their already overstuffed bank accounts.  <br />
B00000F5KH|5.0|So many times a road movie remains on the road, with the young boy remaining in a state of wandering, though of increasing self-discovery.  This remarkable film is a true celebration of rediscovery -- a rediscovery of family and a rediscovery of love.  The mostly happy ending is not even slightly forced, but instead comes across as the real and most satisfying conclusion of a long journey.  The young boy, far from being spoiled or a brat, seems more intent on defending himself and realizes he must keep pushing and pushing his older companion if he is ever to see his father.  His tears show that he is only a little boy on the inside.  Her tears show that she has a warm, tender heart yearning to break free. <br /> <br />Who says a film needs to have a rotten, almost nihilistic ending in order to be \\"deep\\" or \\"meaningful?\\" Family, love, and even sweet sentiment can also be the stuff of depth.  After years of the other stuff, what a refreshing change of pace! <br /> <br />Thanks to Central Station and Mr. Salles for getting it right!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I can understand why people don't like this film.  For me personally, I loved this film.  This is one of those films where either you get it or you don't.
B00000JLWW|1.0|This film boasts the worst screenplay ever written for a movie.  Even some admirers of the film admit to the banal script as being deficient.  The last bits of footage with the distressed captain and the sinking of the ship are very good, even excellent.  However, most of the three hours is taken up with a very substandard love story.  This is not Romeo and Juliet nor is it Rhett and Scarlett.  Instead, it is Jack and Rose -- two kids running around the ship, giving others the finger, and otherwise acting silly (and very naive).  The most overrated film of the 1990's, Titanic is a titanic waste of time and money.  Don't even bother.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I think George Lucas just spilled his coffee.  I better get out of the way for all of you dense and brain washed Star Wars fans out there to pick it up for him.  I remember the first making of Star Wars video that came out after Return of the Jedi hit the streets.  I remember him saying that special effects is just a tool.  Special effects without a plot is a pretty boring thing.  My god, I think he just dropped the ball once again.  Attack of the Clones was even worse and the release of the originals onto dvd is a disaster.  Face the music ladies and gents, the golden age of Star Wars has just left the building.  We will never have another episode IV, V even VI again.
068987474X|5.0|I loved it ... it can be very funny at times, but most of all it was a real eye opener for me... After reading This book I got one for each of my girlfriends. No more putting up with unwanted crap from guys period!
B00005JNEI|1.0|I think Michael Moore is a giant wuss whom is mad at the US for not giving him everything in life.  To fat and overweight to do anything include going the military to comprehend how the world really works outside of his house and from behind him Television.  I rate this 1 star because it was poorly put together and missing a lot of important information.  Only a quarter of the information is presented to the viewer.
B00004Y6NT|5.0|I can't give an objective review of a Dire Straits recording, I think they're all great.  This was the only one I didn't have, and I held back because some cornball in an earlier review said that you couldn't play it on your computer.  That's totally wrong.  I convert all of my CD's to MP3 format and play them on my computer, and I had no trouble converting this one. <br /> <br />As far as the style of the music goes, I would compare it to their first CD, rather than the later ones.  It is a conservative effort, but definitely worth listening to.
B00009YXHN|2.0|Stuart Gordon's 1985 flick RE-ANIMATOR is one of the few genre flicks that successfully combines high-camp horror with bawdy sexual humor and comes out with a cult classic.  But where Gordon's work triumphs, Brian Yuzna's 1990 sequel, BRIDE OF RE-ANIMATOR, proportionally fails.  The gore, the nudity, and the sexual innuendo are blatantly gratuitous, and even strong performances from stars Jeffrey Combs (as mad scientist Herbert West) and Bruce Abbott (as Dan Cain, West's prot&eacute;g&eacute;) can't hide the fact that the humor is no longer as glib and flippant as in the first film and instead seems painfully contrived.  And ardent fans of Gordon's film will be peeved when they see that Yunza has ignored basic plot points of the first, especially in the unexplained revival of a key character killed in the first (i.e., Herbert West himself) and the apparent demise of one saved at the first film's climax (i.e., Cain's girlfriend, Megan Halsey).<br /><br />The FX work in BRIDE OF RE-ANIMATOR is a real mixed bag, and overall, FX fans will come away disappointed.  But one make-up worth noting is the Frankenstein-ish body-suit work done for the re-animated character played by the attractive Kathleen Kinmont.  The exposed muscles, tissues, and organs look gruesomely realistic and should delight gore fans and necrophiliacs alike.<br /><br />The DVD from Artisan will disappoint even the most avid fans of this dreadful sequel.  The original film was shot on 35mm film in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio, but the filmmaker's intentions were for the film to be \\"matted\\" and viewed at an aspect ratio of 1.85:1.  Unfortunately, Artisan caters to the couch-potato mentality and presents the film on DVD in the 1.33:1 format in which the film was shot.  While nothing is missing (it is 1.33:1 but NOT pan-and-scan), the film is still being presented contrary to the vision of its creators.  And on top of that, Artisan doesn't offer any extra parts (i.e., bonus material)!  Herbert West would be mortified.
B000001F3C|4.0|The 1983 U2 release, \\"War,\\" features a boy with haunted eyes on the cover, and the song cycle displays an increasing political awareness by the group, with \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday,\\" \\"Seconds,\\" and \\"New Year's Day.\\"<br /><br />What caught my attention back in the day was the video for \\"New Year's Day\\" played in high circulation on MTV. The band playing their instruments in that snowy field was cool, but I really liked the powerful bassline and piano melody. The Edge's slashing guitar style was unlike anything I'd heard before, and Bono's vocals are passionate and evocative. This remains one of my favorite U2 songs.<br /><br />\\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" invokes images of Irish history, and with its rat-a-tat-tat martial drums and guitars, it's more choppy than \\"New Year's Day\\" but more anthemic. This really hit home with the Red Rocks video when Bono was waving that huge flag. It's a powerful song.<br /><br />\\"Seconds\\" benefits from being sandwiched between these two songs, but the cold war lyric and intertwining vocals of Bono and the Edge, along with the largely acoustic tracking, make this an interesting piece.<br /><br />Another standout is \\"Two Hearts Beat as One,\\" which does not usually make the best of compilations, but is an underrated nugget with a propulsive guitar line and vocal performance by Bono. \\"Like a Song\\" moves with youthful energy and urgency, and the band captures excellent dynamics. \\"40\\" is a short closer, but another anthemic rouser that was captured well on the live Red Rocks EP.<br /><br />While less atmospheric than \\"Unforgettable Fire,\\" the songs on \\"War\\" are full of heart and soul and the band's personal convictions. They're playing like they mean it.
B000065U1N|2.0|This movie claims to be realistic, but realism would imply at least that real Somali actors play the part of the Somalis, not people from (seemingly) West Africa. It feels like we're in Sierra Leone or Liberia, and it looks like those dreadful westerns of the 50's were the Indians were played by Italo-Americans. Maybe someone will one day be able to tell this story properly.
076790592X|3.0|I think this book is highly inspiring mostly to those who are uninspired. If you have examined your life and asked the difficult questions, then this book will not be an epiphany as it is to so many people. To me, this a was a basic \\"what is the meaning of life\\" book. I didn't find the story to be particularly interesting or unique. What I found interesting was the character growth of Mitch Albom who was an idealist brought down to earth by the harsh realities of life but finds his idealism again through Morrie.<br /><br />Overall, I think the book is a worthwhile read. Just don't expect it to offer you something you have never heard or thought of before.
B00062IVKS|5.0|God Damn, De Niro at his best...I swear. These were the days...Marty's doing his directing thing in the best way, they have the perfect girl for the job, Cathy Moriarty!!  And Joe Pesci of course in that fabulous role..  This small cast works together perfectly.  This is a fabulous film, and also a classic in American filmmaking.  For those who haven't seen it, this is a great buy..I fully endorse this DVD for mass sales...  This is what all filmakers should aspire to...The Oscar(s) well deserved..
B00003CXCT|4.0|I have loved \\"Star Wars\\" since 1977 when I saw the original film at the age of 17. I have owned all three movies on video, laserdisc, and now dvd. They look FANTASTIC. There is no denying this. For the most part, I am pleased. But I am totally ticked off about Sebastian Shaw being removed at the end of \\"Return of the Jedi.\\" Anakin turned back to the good side as the elderly man who was Luke's father. It made total sense to leave this scene in. I saw this originally in 1983 when \\"Jedi\\" was released. Is George Lucas saying he made a mistake? I am appalled that Sebastian Shaw, obviously a talented British actor, would be treated in such a way, even if he has passed on.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Me Against The Music- A fast pase dance track. It's a pretty high quality song. Madonnaand Britney bring there star power and vocals to the track. Britney using a girly style of rap speed talk while madonna crunes to the beat. One of Octobobers better tracks. The music video was pretty good. Peaked at number 25 at billboard (7/10) <br /> <br />I've Got That- A Hip Hop urban southern beat to it often reffered to as \\"crunk\\" music. Britney sings lightly to this track. Highly infectious. The Ying Yang Twins rap to a portion of the track. One of the better hip/pop collaberations. (8/10) <br /> <br />Showdown-  One of the better songs off of the tracks one of the few songs that are sensual. She sings about making up after a fight. The production of this track is very high in quaility and has been a top hit in Africa. (9/10) <br /> <br />Breathe On Me- Very Kylie Minogue of Ms. Spears It is a highly club orinated track. Sings about reaching a level of love beyond sex. It iis a serverly powerful songs and again was greatly produced and high in quaility. (9/10) <br /> <br />Early Morning- Moby put a beat on to this and is intriguing. However it is lost when she begins to sing the first few notes of the song. granted talking about a hang over isn't a great way to make a track It is the worst song on the album. (5/10) <br /> <br />Toxic- The dynamic beat and production style is amazing and is shocking. Her voice in this song is increditably orginal. She uses computerized vocals in the middle of the song. She sings about falling in love and being addicted to a man you know is bad for you. peaking at number 9 in maerica and number 1 in several countrries isn't bad at all. (10/10) <br /> <br />Outrageous- Another Hip Hop Urban track only this one is lost and not as greatly produced as the last hip urban song. She sings about the pardy of Material objects and how people are obsessed with them. The beat is interesting and leaves you interigued. No wonder it was number one in India(6.5/10) <br /> <br />Touch Of My Hand- The middle eastern vibe is very sensual. The songs sings about masterbation not being bad or evil as people label it as being. She says she is not ashamed. It also show cases some high notes. (8/10) <br /> <br />The Hook Up- A Dance track that is used in the form of reggae. Yes you heard right reggae the pop princess is experimenting with all types of musical genere. It seems pretty good. Danceable. (7.5/10) <br /> <br />Shadow- One of the best ballads ever experienced how Aerosmith of her. The ballad sings about losing someone. It sings about losing the person you love because they are only a shdow of the person they once were. It is beautiful and she bares her soul and her vocal strenght and vocal control (9.5/10) <br /> <br />Brave New Girl- This one is more insriational then any of the otherrs. It sings about being on your own. Being independent and being free and all the good things that come with it. How she feels about being free. (7.5/10) <br /> <br />Everytime- the most Beautiful Ballad of 2004. It is incrediably raw and emotional. The piano and her voice is the most amazing combo in pop music. The way she used tyhe haunting piano keys to install lose and lonelyness and sorrow is amazing. Peaked at number 13. Number one in many contries. (10/10)
0385508417|4.0|As someone who has more than once said aloud that I would skip Christmas if I could do so, I jumped on this book as soon as I saw it. To extend the subversive joy of reading it, I took it only one chapter or two at a time... until I reached the turning point in the middle.<br /><br />Unfortunately for my commitments the next day, this happened at one in the morning. I was doing a little bedtime reading, intending fully to turn off the light after reading just this one chapter.<br /><br />I did not close the book again until I had read the final page. By this time it was 5 A.M.<br /><br />Even a would-be Scrooge like I am found it generally satisfying. All major loose ends are tied up neatly.<br /><br />However by Christmas Eve I found myself liking Nora less and less. In a similar vein, the only thing I really wish was different was with a few minor characters. Two or three men secretly admired Luther and wished to give Christmas a miss as well; however their overbearing wives would probably have murdered them for even suggesting it. These women are absolute harridans. I kept hoping there'd be a paragraph in the back somewhere where the poor husbands had finally had enough, and gave their wives the only thing for Christmas they really needed... a divorce!<br /><br />Overall, excellent. I wish John Grisham would take a recess from court once in a while to write more accessible stuff like this.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|...pulled the plug on the best drama it had.<br /><br />I am one of the apparently few who saw \\"Firefly\\" when it was on TV two years ago. Unfortunately, I had a hard time at first remembering when it was on (Friday nights) and when I did remember to watch I often felt like I'd missed something important -- continuity, as it turned out. Fox didn't air the episodes in their intended order.<br /><br />Recently, after realizing just how little there was worth watching on TV, I'd been thinking more and more about the series. After reading the reviews here, I got the DVD set and watched all 14 episodes in three days (I probably could have done it in one day, but I have both work and school to contend with). Seeing all the episodes, and in the correct order, it became painfully clear how good this show was, how great it was destined to be, and what a terrible loss it was when Fox canceled it.<br /><br />While it is kind of a sci-fi western, the fact is \\"Firefly\\" transcends genres. This show is clever, exciting, and hilarious. It mixes the profound with grit and humor. In a single episode, I may be muting the sound and turning on subtitles so I don't spill my popcorn when the big scary happens, and then I'm doubled over laughing and backing up to watch a scene over again, repeating the funniest lines aloud (it's okay, I only do that when I'm alone). Then I'm rubbing my hands together in an \\"I love it when a plan comes together\\" manner as I begin to see how the episode is going to resolve itself.<br /><br />Also, I think the casts on shows like this never get enough credit. They have to jump nimbly between drama, suspense, and action and still be able to nail their comedic timing. \\"Firefly\\" has a great ensemble that handles these leaps effortlessly and brings emotional and whimsical depth and nuance to the characters.<br /><br />The DVD release has some nice extras, including a gag reel (brief and punchy), several episode commentaries (one of which provided my biggest belly-laugh in weeks), interviews with cast and crew, and a nice behind-the-scenes look at Serenity, the Firefly-class spaceship our guys call home. All bonuses -- the episodes alone are well worth the asking price.<br /><br />This series was on its way to amazing places, and cutting it off mid-season (or really, as I see it, at anything less than five seasons) left a lot of stories untold and questions unanswered. Can't believe another network didn't snatch it up. Here's hoping the movie (watch for \\"Serenity\\" in September 2005) is a brilliant success (I'll be doing my part!) and some other network decides it would make a great series.d crew, and a nice behind-the-scenes look at Serenity, the Firefly-class spaceship our guys call home.

B000001G89|5.0|This recording stars Placido Domingo as Don Jose, Teresa Berganza as Carmen, Sherill Milnes as Escamillo and Ileana Contrubas as Micaela. With a cast like that and with conductor Claudio Abbado, you can't go wrong. It is indeed a very well-executed Carmen. My favorite and first choice is, however, Grace Bumbry in the title role and Jon Vickers as Escamillo, Mirella Freni as Micaela and the lesser known Kostas Paskalis as Escamillo in a 1970 recording. That one is the authentic Opera-Comique version that Georges Bizet produced in Paris in 1875. It is supposed to have dialogue and not recitative, which most productions of Carmen use today, which I believe is the Choudens version. There have been many Carmens in the operatic jungle- among them even sopranos who take on this role written for mezzo-soprano- Maria Callas, Leontine Price, Shirley Verrett Grace Bumbry and most recently at the LA Opera I saw Catherine Malfitano in the role. But the role is better suited for mezzo-sopranos like Teresa Berganza in this recording. Or in the very least flexible mezzos turned sopranos such as Grace Bumbry and Shirley Verrett which I've already mentioned. Berganza has a charm and wit which makes her a very enjoyable Carmen. Her voice is light but secure, and she has all the right intonation for many of the key moments- the Habanera, Seguidilla, Gypsy Dance, the moment when she learns of her inevitable death through the tarot cards and of course the finale. <br /> <br /> Opposite Teresa Berganza is Placido Domingo who is sensational as Don Jose. The role fits him like a glove, especially because the character is so passionate. The fact that Domingo and Berganza are Spanish and are in a sense playing Spanish characters makes it even more delicious. Ileana Contrubas, who has been acclaimed as a fine Violetta in Traviata makes a very touching performance as the anguished and innocent Micaela. Micaela was apparently a part thrown in at the last minute to provide the dark opera with some light and romance. Only her feelings are pure and untouched by adult machinations. Her arias are noble and beautiful (Je Dis Que Rien\\" is like a prayer) while the others seem to express conflict and verisomo forces of passions, sex, violence and vulgarity. Baritone Sherill Milnes had a Heaven-blessed baritone voice that is perfect for the macho part of Escamillo the bullfighter. Everything he did is pure gold, from his Scarpia in Tosca to his Count Di Luna in Verdi's Trovatore to his Rigoletto. Carmen is an opera about passions and fatal attraction. The liberated and undefeated Carmen is so free-willed that even her death seems to have been embraced by her. Living a criminal and reckless life, she was certain her death would come some day. She never dreamed it to come from an otherwise naive and infatuated young soldier.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|Satoshi Kon is earning a place for himself in the history books crafting one animated masterpiece after another.  Tokyo Godfathers has scenes of sincere emotional weight and power.  Bring some kleenex for this one I cried at least two times during this film...My wife cried about five times.  This is one of the most magical and compassionately humanistic films I have ever seen live action, animated or otherwise.  Wonderful music in this as well.
1563899426|5.0|Fairy tales are real.  They have a life of their own.  Unfortunately, most of the fairy tale lands have been taken over by a villain known as the Adversary.  As a result, the characters have fled to our world where they lead a hidden existence in New York.  Most have been here for centuries.  The main settlement is a colony on Bullfinch street.  King Cole is in charge but Snow White really runs things.  The sheriff is the Big Bad Wolf (a.k.a. Bigby). <br /> <br />At the start of the story, there is a crisis.  Snow White's sister Rose Red has been murdered.  Bigby must try and solve the murder while the community is planning for their annual festival where they raise the money needed to operate for another year. <br /> <br />Jack the Giant Killer, Prince Charming, the Three Pigs, Bluebeard. Little Boy Blue, Beauty and the Beast, and many others come together in this wonderful treatment of fairy tales.  It doesn't hurt that the mystery is well plotted and developed.  A very entertaining read. <br />
B00024BHTC|5.0|Well Nightwish has been my favorite band for 7 years now, and every CD they put out becomes my favorite. This is no exception. This is their masterpiece, and I can't fathom what they can write next. Any band can put out 1 or 2 great CD's...but for NW to continuously be putting out quality 5 star albumns...it's just amazing. <br /> <br />For those of you who thought NW's vocals were too operatic in their previous CD's...they have kinda brought her vocal power down some...but it's still perfect.  <br /> <br />The guitars have also changed - they've gotten heavier. More metal. <br /> <br />They still experiment some, and a lot of the songs I think will be more mainstream, but they are still beautiful.  <br /> <br />For those of you who think Evanescence are THE female vocal band to listen to....get real. Tarja puts Amy Lee to shame, and the music is much more emotion, complex, and beautiful. <br /> <br />If you're looking to get into this band, this is a fine place to start. Perfect.

0790731983|3.0|When I watched this film I had no idea that liza minnelli was the main character, and I was under the impression that it was a fairly new film. I'm glad I didn't know who the actors and actresses were because I got a fresh look at the film, and it was very entertaining. <br /> <br />I love musicals, and this one was very unique to most of the others that I've seen. I think the numbers and the costumes were delightful, it had great acting, and the technical details of the film were wonderful. I really didn't like the plot at all though. The drama was good, and the story was good, but it never went anywhere. I think the real meaning of the story got brushed aside completely and fuzzed up a bit. It leaves you feeling as if you've watched a whole movie in preparation for something to happen, building up to a climax that doesn't exist. <br /> <br />Overall, I recommend the movie lovers of music, theater, and burlesque...but don't expect to be riveted to your seat. even though it's good, it's a movie I probably wouldn't be able to sit through again.
B000059Z8J|2.0|I saw this movie recently, and despite being a life-long fan of the Superman character and possessor of a very in-depth knowledge of his history and significance, I really didn't like this film. It conflicted too much with the vision of Superman I'd developed on my own. The special effects are strong, but the dialogue is spectacularly cheesy at points, and Superman comes off as too much of an amateurish buffoon for my taste. Lex Luthor has got to be the least credible villain ever to appear in a comic-book film, and his side-kicks Otis and Ms. Tessmacher are probably the two most blatant examples of Hollywood bastardization to ever appear in comic-book film. The characters on a whole aren't taken seriously at all, and its practically a spoof of the source material. Despite what you've been told, it is anything but the definitive Superhero movie. Even as a hardcore DC Comics fan, I think I've got to give that honor to the first X-men film. <br /> <br /> <br />P.S: As for the infamous ending... it makes sense if you've seen Back to the Future as much as I have: just because a person goes back to a period in which they already existed doesn't mean their past self no longer exists in that period. Thus, 'Future' Superman can go back in time to save Lois while his Present self still prevents all the disasters.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|That I didnt watch this series while it was on the air!  <br />I was a huge Buffy and Angel fan but the premise of Firefly didnt grab me so I never watched it. Once it was cancelled then came out on video, I regret it so much now! <br />This show is classic Joss, no matter what, if you like Buffy or Angel, youll love this series. The characters, ALL of them, are unique and interesting, the writing is sharp as a knife and its hilarious as hell! <br />Like others, when I came to the \\"final\\" episode, I was really truly left wanting more... Im so glad that Serenity is being made and cant wait for it. Hopefully it will get big box office dollars and we see a revival, a la The Family Guy! <br /> <br />Come on people, see it, love it, bring it back!
B00000HZFH|5.0|This is an album I love and respect each time I listen to it.  I respect it because Doug Martsch engages in some self-abnegation in order to produce more finely crafted, balanced songs.  Much like guitar myth Richard Thompson, who saves most his guitar heroics for live performances, Martsch largely abstains from the astounding solos at which he excels in live shows in order to keep the focus on the songs.  This isn't to say that he doesn't plan some amazing guitar on the album; indeed, the album stands almost as an encyclopedia of the uses to which a guitar can be put in a song.  But it is to say that instead of solos or instrumental breaks that showcase his formidable skills as a guitarist, he opts instead for using his instrument as a means of texturing and coloring each songs.  Martsch largely achieves this by magically synthesizing a host of predecessor guitarists.  Contrast him with Thompson again for a moment:  Thompson constantly plays guitar parts that sound like no one else in the history of guitar.  Martsch constantly plays bits that sound like earlier guitarists, but the genius comes from the way he seamlessly blends them together to achieve a magical synthesis.  He can sound in the span of a few songs like guitarists as varied as Johnny Marr of The Smiths, Neil Young, Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd of Television, J. Mascis of Dinosaur Jr., Greg Sage, Richard Quine, Robbie Robertson, Bob Mould, and even the Edge.  But it is Martsch's ability to spin on a dime to channel some guitar trick he picked up from somewhere and blend it with something else he learned in another place that can make this album so sonically exhilarating.<br /><br />Thanks to Martsch's genius on guitar, these songs are perfectly crafted entities, but that doesn't mean that the album as a whole is perfect.  As much as I adore Martsch as a musician and writer, he isn't the most compelling vocalist on the planet, and if you were to search for the album's weak link, it is his singing.  He isn't a bad vocalist; he simply doesn't sing as well as he does everything else.  Also, I don't care for the way the voice is balanced with the rest of the band's elements.  The voice is way back in the mix, and barely stands out from the multi-tracked guitars, bass, and drums.  Compare him again with Thompson, who always has his voice (admittedly a bit stronger than Martsch's) at the front of the mix.  On nearly every song the band tends to obscure what is happening vocally, which is a shame because the lyrics are frequently quite interesting.<br /><br />Still, this remains one of the finest alternative albums of the late nineties, and a must-own for anyone who loves great music or a master guitarist.  The songs are all absolutely brilliant, veritable kaleidoscopes of sound.He isn't a bad vocalist; he simply doesn't sing as well as he does everything else.

031286504X|4.0|I recommend this horror collection if you enjoyed Night of the Living Dead/Castaway/28 Days Later.  The bulk of what you're getting here is the 170 page novel of \\"I am Legend\\".  The main character, Robert Neville is what makes this novel so great.  He is reminiscent of John Wayne/Charleton Heston muchismo, a bold, in your face tough guy.  Getting drunk, smoking cigarettes, and vampire hunting never looked this good.  There is not enough of that in literature, IMO.  \\"I am Legend\\" turns out to be a great social commentary, begging the question, \\"Who is the real outcast?\\" in a Planet of the Apes tone.<br /><br />Short stories that stick out most in this edition are \\"Dance of the Dead\\", \\"Mad House\\", and \\"Dress of White Silk\\".  Each short is thought provocative in their own ends and it was enjoyable noting differences in style between each.<br /><br />This is a collection definitely worth a look, especially is you are a fan of the horror/suspense genre.

B00005JNEI|5.0|This film is a real splash of ice cold water.  Moore reveals his view of the potential motivations behind some of the recent political directions. This film attempts to answer many outstanding political questions about the U.S. and asks many more.<br /><br />There are funny moments, there are sad moments, and there are very sad moments. Moore uses his fantastic sense of humour to lighten the deep and serious observations suggested.  I especially enjoyed his choice of music to make his point or add humour.<br /><br />The film will grab you emotionally and forces you to ask: how did this happen and how could this happen?  It is almost impossible to not react to this film in a soul-searching manner.  No matter what your opinion is of Bush or Michael Moore, see this film!  It deserved the awards and accolades it won and it deserves the buzz it is creating.  More films like this should exist.  It will leave you spinning.
078322799X|4.0|A lot of people don't really seem to know how to take this film, but then again it's generally acknowledged that comedy-horror is one of the most difficult genres in film-making... Ken Weiderhorn summed it up in his audio commentary to \\"Return of the Living Dead Part II\\" when he said that comedy and horror are opposites - people who like horror don't tend to like it mixed with comedy as this undermines the horror, and people who like comedies don't tend to like horror. Tough genre, then! <br />As a fan of Peter Jackson's early low-budget gross-out horror-comedies \\"Bad Taste\\" and \\"Brain Dead\\", I had no problems at all with this film and thoroughly enjoyed what he did with a big budget, courtesy of Robert Zemeckis and Hollywood - the kinetic style and imagination of Jackson's earlier films was still present, he just had a whole lot more money to spend on some great visuals! I'm also a fan of Jeffrey \\"Reanimator\\" Combs, and he's hilarious in this! The story has it that Jackson insisted on making this film in his homeland of New Zealand in order to avoid undue intrusion from the studio suits, and it shows - if this film had been made in Hollywood with the suits on-set every day then I think it would've turned out far tamer, blander, compromised ... and PG-13! As it is, Hollywood got a R-rated horror-comedy that's funny and gory in equal amounts - and they probably had no idea who to aim the marketing at! Such considerations matter less once a film has passed the theatrical release, and with Jackson's considerable success with the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, I hope this film gets reappraised and seen for what it is - one of the most imaginative big-budget horror-comedies you're ever likely to see. <br />One major gripe - a Signature Collection Laserdisc edition of \\"The Frighteners\\" was released, containing 12 minutes of additional footage and literally hours of bonus material. I've seen it, and the additional footage is great stuff - it's not just a load of padding, some of it is really funny stuff - and that makes this extras-free DVD of the theatrical cut look pretty half-hearted. After the success of the Lord of the Rings, I was sure this version of The Frighteners would get the multi-disc DVD release it deserves - but there's no sign of it. What's up with that, Universal?
B000035P5E|4.0|So, at first I had trouble deciding if this film was great or just another war film that would be forgotten about as the years progressed.  It was a tough decision that required a day of thought.  There were definitely scenes in this film that would embarrass even the most novice movie goer, yet there is something about the story and the humanistic approach to a non-human element that seeps from this film's pores.  The scene that stands out the most in my mind is when Sutherland is running to the rain to catch Lucy.  You can obviously tell that he is on a sound stage and water is being thrown in his face.  His acting and the way that that particular scene was set up was appalling.  It made me laugh instead of feel any sort of suspense or fear.  It forced credibility for Sutherland's character right out the door.  There were several other scenes that just didn't seem to fit in this film that made you question the theatrical release of this film or if it was a straight-to-television production.  If you can get through these few lapses in the director's train of thought, then you will be able to see the powerful story that lies within.<br /><br />When I first saw the box to this film I didn't know what to expect.  To my utter enjoyment, Eye of the Needle is one of those gems hiding in a mud puddle.  After you wipe it off (look away from the DVD cover), you will begin to see the beauty of this film.  As we begin our story, we see Sutherland as a normal person, but as the film advances, our idea and interpretation of his character blows our mind.  When most war films simply believe in keeping you in your theater seats by showing graphic images of battle and chaos, this film goes in the completely other direction.  This is a story between two people and the small battle that they fight for their beliefs.  I mentioned earlier that I felt this was a very humanistic film.  The reason for that statement is because we witness the human element to war.  Billy is the perfect example of a man who has lost a portion of his life, yet is too depressed to see the happiness in front of him.  Normally in war films this comes late story, but in Eye of the Needle it is shown right up front.  Next, we hardly ever are given a very human side to the villain in these stories.  Normally, they kill without remorse, but again, not in this film.  What we witness are two humans caught between a hard place with nobody else to turn to.<br /><br />While war is being raged overseas with thousands of troopers, it is impressive to see stories like this that revolve around just two people.  These two people can have the same effect on the war as a brigade of soldiers.  I never saw their reaction to each other coming.  I wasn't expecting a message in this film.  I brief history lesson about the day to day activities surrounding this dark cloud of our world's history.  Also, I wasn't expecting to see such powerful acting from Donald Sutherland and Kate Nelligan.  Together they created more sparks on screen than most duos today.  What they create is better and more realistic than most Hollywood jargon.<br /><br />It is impressive to see this in a war film.  I cannot stress that enough.  This film surprised me and I am normally not a huge war fan.  I think the reason that it stood out was because director Richard Marquand develops two amazing characters and places them in a war torn country, only to uproot them again into a place of beauty and nature.  We go from one spectrum to the next with Marquand and it works.  Ken Follett, who wrote the novel that this film is based, has done a great job of taking a world that is huge and bringing it down to just these two characters.  It is not often that you see that in a war film, especially one made in 1981.<br /><br />Overall, I flip-flopped my decision all around until I finally made a choice.  This film was amazing.  I can look past the low-budgeted scenes that make this film dated in the 80s, and see the amazing truth behind the characters and story.  This is one of the most impressive stories that I have seen come from Hollywood.  I could literally watch this film again and probably catch more that I missed the first time.  This isn't your average spy film; this is instead a film about humans and the comfort we need in our lives.  Also, I must end with this note, if any villain (without saying who) can use his trademark kill six times in forty minutes, you should realize that this film is going to be a great ride.<br /><br />Grade: **** out of *****azing truth behind the characters and story.

B0002DB52M|4.0|I think anyone who knows anything about the work of Lars von Trier can appreciate that his work is divisive at best, downright sadistic at worst. Dogville isn't an exception to that, of course, but it's among his better films. I don't think it's really possible to actually enjoy a movie this cynnical and unsettling, but it can certainly be appreciated if you can get past its eccentricities. <br /> <br />The story is actually very simple. Grace (Nicole Kidman), a young woman on the run from gangsters in depression-era America, stumbles into the tiny mountain hamlet of Dogville. There, she's taken in by resident philosopher Tom Edison Jr (Paul Bettany), who uses her arrival as a chance to prove his theories about the stubborn and hypocritical nature of the town's citizens. Although the initial reception to Grace is chilly at best, the fifteen residents of the villiage eventually accept, and in turn begin to exploit the young woman. As the hunt for her intensifies, Grace's situation amongst the locals becomes ever more desperate until finally a breaking point is reached when entire town turns against her and the mobsters arrive to claim her.  <br /> <br />The justification for the melodramatic tone of the movie is that, unlike other von Trier heroines (eg: Selma from Dancer in the Dark), Grace is no more an innocent sacrifice than any of the town's vicious citizens. Nor is Tom, who is quite aware of the complex morality involved, but is just as guilty of falling short of his own standard as anyone else. The apocalyptic (in a very Biblical sense) conclusion of the exercise of the pair's particular dogmas is a natural progression of the story's core themes, outlined in the conversation between Nicole Kidman and James Caan in the concluding chapter. One feels unsettled watching the film, not because of any emotional manipulation, but because of how frighteningly easy it is to identify with the hypocritical arrogance and/or polite savagery taking place onscreen. The \\"finalillustration\\" is grim and offers a view of humanity that Thomas Hobbes might have appreciated, and there is a distinctly anti-American element to it, which could be a turn-off. Still, it makes sense and it makes a point, which makes the film successful in the storytelling aspect.  <br /> <br />Cinematically, the film is unconventional as well. It was shot entirely on a single soundstage with ambient lighting and no background scenery. The town of Dogville itself (the only setting) is comprised of basic props and chalk outlines, which makes the experience not unlike watching a stage production. This can be very distracting at times, but to his credit, von Trier uses it to get some very creative shots - he uses the camera to reveal and obscure different events in ways that wouldn't be possible given normal location shooting. The blank backgrounds also create a sense of claustrophobia and add distinctly to the pervasive ominous feeling throughout the story's three hours. <br /> <br />Nicole Kidman gives the best performance of the cast - logical, since she has the most to do. Paul Bettany and Patricia Clarkson (Vera) are the other standouts in my mind. There are certianly very stiff moments throughout the lengthy production and some of the characters are a little underdeveloped, but there aren't any really glaring flaws with the cast. And John Hurt does a devilish job with the novel-like narration that adds a distinctly black sense of humor to the proceedings (which offers a few much-needed relief moments). <br /> <br />In summation, Dogville is long, weird and harsh. It's an exercise in applied philosophy and in that, more artistic sense it's not only very watchable, but of a high caliber. However, movies are as much entertainment as they are art - it would be foolish to ignore that - and this is NOT an entertaining movie, which means even though I enjoyed it, it will not be to everyone's taste. But then, that's par for the course, I suppose.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show made me run home to turn on the tv...something I almost never do.  However, after I watched it on DVD I was even more impressed by the show.  The reason why is that the executive drones of FOX not only prematurely killed off this brilliant show, but they aired the episodes out of order!  Some of the inconsistencies that I noted were not mistakes on Joss Whedon's part, but on FOX's.  Also, seeing the additional unaired episodes was truly worth the asking price.
0805076476|5.0|There is a scene in Fight Club that sums up the thrust of this explosive novel-the nameless protagonist holds a gun to a kid's head and asks what he wants to do with his life instead of making just enough money to buy cheese and a TV, if he doesn't answer he dies. Living in a nihilistic society where your life needs to be threatened to feel alive, Fight Club takes us to a place beneath the surface, where we are broken down and bottom out before we can recreate ourselves better and stronger. The relationship between the POV and his mentor/nemesis, Tyler Durden, ranges from hero-worship to pure homoerotica. Palahniuk's first novel is a social commentary that gives the proletariat the upper-hand to change the world through planned acts of random violence.
B00005JNEU|3.0|Taken from the nonfiction book of the same name, \\"Friday Night Lights\\" uses the real-life struggles of a Texas High School football team--with a few embellishments--skims over the tough subjects, and mixes the typical exhilarating/exaggerated Hollywood football with real footage to create film that is both realistic and intense. <br /> <br />    While most high school kids lack authority figures to guide them, the kids at Permian High have plenty of adults pushing them.  Pushing them to play football and play it well.  The star running back's future depends on it, the quarterback desires to play well so he can leave town, the fullback's father beats him for dropping the ball, and the rest of the team carries the weight of the town on its shoulders.  In one of the more poignant scenes, the kids discuss how they don't feel seventeen.  The film does an outstanding job of portraying football as life for the kids.  Unfortunately, it barely touches on the town's racism, grotesque amounts of money spent on football, grade inflation for players, and other negative elements surrounding the town's obsession. Instead it chooses to focus on the struggles of the team:  an injury to their star player, a loss to their rival, the coach's job security, etc.  Which isn't entirely bad, it makes for an uplifting story. <br /> <br />     Aesthetically, the film is above par compared to most football movies.  The camera work gives a true feel for what its like to be on the field, however, some of the tackles, and plays in general are overblown.  By the end it tends to look like a highlight reel.  But it is done for the audience and isn't unlike films such as \\"Varsity Blues\\" and \\"Remember the Titans\\".  The film's faults are forgivable and never outweigh its redeeming qualities.  \\"Friday Night Lights\\" may not deliver the same power punch that the book does, but it will leave most viewers, even those who don't care much for football, satisfied.
B00008CLOA|5.0|First of all, musically, this album needs to be taken in context. We all know what `50s rock & roll sounded like. Chuck Berry, Little Richard. The Beatles started with that, and over the next decade, helped convert one stream of rock to the progressive sound of late-'60s/early-'70s experimantal bands. Pink Floyd was an acid-tinged psychedelic take on rock, and grew over time from a one-chord, jamming-on-dope group into a more melodic album-oriented band.    In the years immediately following Dark Side of the Moon's 1973 creation, we had the lighthearted `70s pop, which divided, one direction moving toward the likes of AC/DC's hardcore (for the time) heavy metal... the other direction becoming pop/disco. Between those two extremes lay the album-oriented FM bands that I enjoyed. Dark Side is not dance music or Top 40 Pop. It does not thump... (except for a certain heartbeat). If you like hip-hop... it's probably not your thing.    But I'm surprised nobody's mentioned that it's almost a rough draft for The Wall... seems to me Roger Waters is trying to tell a story, but with Dark Side the message got kind of lost in the music. Perhaps the lyrics were too obscure for dopers to make the connection. It's called a \\"concept album\\", but to many clouded minds the concept is sketchy at best. So Waters started over from scratch, doing a re-write and spelling it all out in easy-to-read letters in The Wall.       My rake is this: The album begins with a heartbeat (as does life), and with the cries of labor or delivery fading in, the audio blossoms into Speak to Me/Breathe-- the lyrics to this song are the voice of a (decidedly cynical) parent describing the wonders of life to a child. The second verse is a warning: \\"Run, rabbit, run... don't sit down, it's time to dig another one\\". And as the child explores his world, he does indeed quickly become On The Run, discovering life in an unceasing and fast-paced sequence of weird sound effects that allow the listener to create his or her own imagery. Finally, something gives way, and you think you can rest quietly...     Time flies when you're on the run, and every day that you find ten years have got behind you, you find this album has a new and deeper meaning. \\"And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking,\\" so even though you have Great Deeds left undone, or think you've something more to say, you retire to your country estate. And as you warm your bones beside the fire, you quietly slip into The Great Gig in the Sky. You gotta go sometime.    Side two seems to be a collection of short themes; stray ideas that Waters couldn't make fit into the Story Of Life that is side one. Money... the song speaks for itself. Everybody loves Money. Money-- it's a hit. Even though it has a 7/8 time signature, years before Rush started doing 7/8 time in all their songs to be flashy.    Us and Them is an anti-war song, and I do believe that if you check, war affected both Waters and \\"Pink\\", his alter-ego protagonist in The Wall, rather profoundly. I don't think the song is as much a social commentary on the perceived differences between peoples, except for whatever the listener can read into it. I'm sure Roger Waters wants to make a big Social Statement, but the song itself ends up being pretty simple, really. Read the lyrics straight through. War is pointless, and in the end, the old veteran dies penniless, with none of the glory that is expected of War Heroes. Touching. Meanwhile...    Any Colour You Like is a blast from the past: a straightforward early Pink Floyd jam session. There is no chord progression-- is it even a chord? I once heard someone say disdainfully that Pink Floyd music was just a \\"collection of sounds\\". This is probably what they meant. Any Colour hearkens back to the Syd Barrett days. And whatever became of Syd? Well, Syd's song dissolved into Brain Damage, which has a completely different sound. You can hear a lot of The Wall in Brain Damage, both musically and conceptually. It is a Roger Waters song, with nary an overtone of the Syd Barrett sound. And although the band he's in has now started playing different tunes, Waters concludes that they'll meet on the Dark Side of the Moon.    Let me spell it out: the Dark Side of the Moon is Death. Thus put, the last song makes sense. Everything, all that there is and \\"all that you do, and everything under the sun is in tune.\\" Everything is as it should be, and is the way it will be. But it's all Eclipsed by that Moon. In the end, everything dies. So the final line has some meaning, \\"There is no dark side of the Moon, really. As a matter of fact, it's all dark.\\"    But then there's a heartbeat...
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|This is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review. <br /> <br />I am a fan of Homer and the original texts, but the interventionist Gods had to be cut to allow for a film that wouldn't be viewed as farcical to a contemporary audience.   <br /> <br />I had never been a fan of Brad Pitt, and frankly expected to be disappointed in his portrayal of Achilles.  I was WRONG, his portrayal was EXCELLENT, and it prompted me to take a look at the work he's been doing since his days on the covers of the teenage magazines.  He has done some excellent work and I think it has been dismissed because he is so photogenic.  <br /> <br />Playing Achilles is wrought with all the pitfallls of playing Hamlet.  We all know the story, the scenes, and the lines.  There have been great paintings depicting scenes such as Priam begging Achilles for Hector's body.  This is every bit as tough as trying to deliver Hamlet's \\"To be or not to be...\\".  The actor's great challenge is to make those words his own, in order to be believable as the character.  Brad Pitt accomplishes this and it is no small feat.  I for one applaud his courage in taking on this role, and would be the first to rise for a standing ovation for the performance he delivers. <br /> <br />The score for Troy by James Horner is magnificent, evocative, and compelling.  \\"Remember Me\\" should be a serious contender for the Oscar, and shouldn't be missed.  I'll tune in on Oscar night just to cheer for James Horner, and Troy. <br /> <br />The lessons of the tale of Troy are lessons for the ages; the archetypal personalities ring as true today as they ever did, and the screenplay captures them with messages such as: <br /> <br />\\"War is young men dying and old men talking.\\" <br />\\"Men are wretched things.\\" <br />\\"There will always be another war, I can promise you that.\\" <br />\\"I want what all men want, I just want it more.\\" <br /> <br />What is it that man wants?  Immortality.  A name that will live forever.  How many men overthe centuries have been willing to trade everything for personal glory?  Mankind is ever the same.   <br /> <br />When I first read the Iliad, I wept for Hector and the mighty Achilles, and I wept again with this film.  Wept for them and all of mankind, because we seem to have so little control of our destinies, as we try to exert complete control over our world. <br /> <br />Set aside your preconceived notions of Mr. Pitt, open yourself to the experience of this film, stop looking for disappointment, and you'll experience a wonderful, yet emotionally devastating, heartbreaking film.  Theatre requires a \\"suspension of disbelief\\" on the part of the audience to work its magic.    <br /> <br />Judge this film for yourself, with an open mind, and an open heart. <br /> <br />Kaller S. Gilbert <br />Portland, Oregon <br />
B00005JNEU|5.0|I just can't recall a movie about football that I enjoyed this much. It's so well done. The movie inspires me to go on to read the nonfiction book of the same title.<br /><br />Great performance from Billy Bob Thornton, who turns out to be the perfect choice for this role. Great performance from everyone else too. The characters are so believable that it's hard to remember that it isn't a documentary. The side stories (the kid with the alcoholic father trying to live vicariously through his son's football career, the kid for whom an injury could change everything, etc.) are very well done. I'm having a hard time finding anything to fault.<br /><br />This movie goes with \\"October Sky\\" in helping to explain why some kids escape difficulties that other kids use to blame for delinquency and anti-social behavior. Both, incidentally, were based on true stories.<br /><br />In \\"October Sky,\\" kids who are followers find a positive influence to gravitate towards (Homer Hickam, who enthuses them about rockets). In \\"Friday Night Lights,\\" kids who are followers find a positive influence to gravitate towards (the high school football team).<br /><br />In both cases, the positive influences are enough to overcome otherwise negative influences (such as the physically abusive father) and provide a bridge through that precarious time when the late teen is, briefly, the most dangerous animal on the planet.<br /><br />I used to be one of those people who might have argued the town spends too much on football, what about academics, the jock clique sucks, etc., etc. Having written about drifting misfit kids drawn to the wrong kind of leader and violence, thus ending up in prison for the rest of their lives, I now feel very strongly that anything that provides a positive influence is good. Football is good. It offers these kids hope, a goal, discipline, moments of triumph, something they can master independently of anyone else, just for themselves. I'll bet that small towns like this that have strong football programs are less likely to have, say, a high school shooting, because of the program and the way it draws in virtually the whole town. Football isn't part of the problem--it's part of the solution.<br /><br />Much, much to like about this movie. I love the details like the signs on the stores that close when everyone's at the game. I loved the ending, which just capped the film for me by not ruining it with schmaltz. It must've been so tempting to go with a different, happier ending.<br /><br />I also thought Lucas Black's performance was just outstanding. Perfect pitch.<br /><br />Nope, this is a must-see.grams are less likely to have, say, a high school shooting, because of the program and the way it draws in virtually the whole town.

B0002Z0EYK|3.0|The film as a film, was ok. A lot of good action, good cinematography, and so on, but it missed out on the whole point of the Iliad.  The thing that bugged me first, was that they advertised it for Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom, and Eric Bana.  I love all of them, they are great actors, but they are not the story.  What I felt was wrong was that some of them just didn't \\"become\\" their characters.  The only actor that I felt truly showed their quality was Sean Bean as Odysseus, he pulled that character off so well, and I think that if the Odyssey were made with Sean, it would be amazing.   <br /> <br />Also, Where were the Gods/Goddesses??  That was what made the Iliad!  <br /> <br />And of course the big question *SPOILER* Why did Menelaus die??????  I was so mad! Of all of them, HE does not die, Agamemnon does, although not until he returns home and is killed by his wife.  COME ON! <br /> <br />So, to sum it up, it was a good watch, and I'll probably buy it, but you can't possibly say you love the Trojan War, until you've read the Iliad and the Odyssey.
B0001Z36PK|3.0|How very disappointing.  I purchased this based on the strength of regeneration and was hopeful that, like the other reviews said, it contained a bit of a return to the style of Hannon's previous works.  This album has left me totally cold- It's dull, dull, dull.  Not bad, but there is just nothing here to compare with the type of writing found on Promenade or Fin de Siecle.  Over all, a very lackluster performance.  I expected better.

B00005JLRT|1.0|I grew up with the TNG crew, since I was quite young I watched the show religiously every week until it ended. I thought the series was incredible and definately one of the all-time greats. I'm a proud owner of all the Star Trek TNG season set boxes and I even enjoy star trek generations and insurrection! But this movie is just absolutely horrid. I feel like I'm wasting my time by writing anything more about it but since I'm here....<br /><br />Why its bad: The Writing is simply horrible, the moron that wrote this screenplay didnt know the characters half as well as the average TNG fan. He simply got all of the characters WRONG. Picard does things he never would do, most of the cast is virtually ignored, Data isn't himself, etc etc. The actual storyline is laughable and seems like the plot was developed around the redundant action sequences rather than the other way around. This is the first piece of Star Trek that I would go as far to even call blasphemous. Every Star Trek movie from Trek 1-9 and all the shows including Voyager and Enterprise have atleast some element of the star trek spirit. This film is completely devoid of that spirit. If you are a self-respecting Star Trek (or TNG) fan avoid this like the plague. The story ends so badly for our beloved characters that it simply isnt worth seeing. I mean it, this movie will leave a bad taste in the mouth of any real trek fan. TNG ended with the masterful final episode of the series \\"All Good Things\\". That is the sendoff they deserved and the end that should be remembered. Trek movies 7-9 can be enjoyed for fluff but this movie should be AVOIDED.
1401301010|5.0|Although this book is mainly about Anthony's drug addiction, it is still an awesome book.  It is almost a case study of how a child can get messed up by his parents, and in Anthony's case, by his father, Blackie.  Anthony was on his own basically from the age of 10 as his father was a drug dealing dude in the West Hollywood area.  Anthony had to get himself to school and back and try and sleep through drug/sex orgies at night with celebrities in and out buying drugs constantly.  He moved away from Blackie at the age of around 14 and was on his own.  He made it by hook or crook and found ingenious ways to get drugs, food, money - whatever he needed.  He has not been able to sustain a relationship with a woman, but I think it's because he doesn't know what love is as he was really not nurtured as a child.  He has hidden his pain through drugs for years, but supposedly he is off drugs now and trying to walk the straight and narrow.  I personally don't know how many of these bands survive living in the LA area.  I lived there for a short time and came back to Texas as it is too hard core for me.  I have to say that the lyrics that Anthony writes are haunting and very poetic.  I feel the lost soul in them.  Best Wishes to Anthony.

B0006213WG|5.0|People have the wrong idea about Sum 41. The Canadian punk quartet where a bunch of young guys having fun, enjoying the incredible perks of their occupation and out and out doing whatever they pleased. They were widely praised as a punk-rock band that helped transform the teen-pop period on TRL, however while they were influential in the success of copy-cat bands today, for some reason they were always just considered a novelty band, parody pushing teenagers who couldn't be taken seroiously. However that wasn't the case and isn't the case; they deserved to be taken seriously because they had serious talent. All Killer no Filler may have had its immature moments, but the real transformation began with their heavily praised Does this Look Infected. The album was easily one of the better records of that year and the music spoke for itself. And while Does this Look Infected may have been one of the better records of that year, Chuck, the group's latest release is this year's best.<br /><br />While I may have said that Gavin DeGraw's Chariot Stripped was going to take this year's top honor, every true critic has the ability to retract their original statements, what I like to call the power of the press. Sum 41's new material is their Mona Lisa, 13 tracks of pure pop/punk/rock perfection devided into 2-4 mintue morsels that are just irresistable to the ear. \\"We're All to Blame\\" is a fantastic single and song. The new found maturity in their lyrics is clearly present in tracks like \\"Some Say\\", \\"No Reason\\" & one of the album's most moving moments, \\"Slipping Away\\", which is the epitomy of what a rock ballad should sound like.<br /><br />This time around the boys aren't taking any lip, they are out to prove that they aren't just some group of punks with an out of control life style that has gotten the best of them. This time around they have struck gold, and they did it in massive amounts. I highly recommend this album, its a revolution in its own right and its destined to be a rock classic.to be a rock classic.

Kurt doesn't win the safe-drivers' award for the year, but he does manage to skid the Jumbo to safety. But I liked the earlier scenes aboard the jet even better than the exciting ending.

As there are a number of competing paperback editions of Stevenson's novella and the text of the story is essentially the same (allowing for minor editorial variants), readers should consider the issue of what else besides the main text they will be getting for their money, and this edition is unusually rich in supplementary features, so that the original story makes up only 55 of its 222 pages. <br /> <br />In addition to the text of Stevenson's \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\\" with explanatory notes by the editor, this volume also contains: <br /> <br />A preface by the editor, a \\"textual appendix\\" about textual variants in the manuscripts, a map of 19th century London marking places mentioned in the story, a timeline of the major events in the life of author Robert Louis Stevenson, and a bibliography.  Plus... <br /> <br />An excerpt from a biography about Stevenson by Graham Balfour about the circumstances of the story's authorship... <br /> <br />A brief excerpt from Stevenson's \\"A Chapter on Dreams,\\" which discusses the influence of his dreams on the story... <br /> <br />12 letters by Stevenson that discuss aspects of the \\"Dr. Jekyll\\" story... <br /> <br />10 contemporary reviews and comments about \\"Dr. Jekyll\\" that show how the story was originally received... <br /> <br />Another horror-oriented short story by Stevenson entitled \\"Markheim\\"... <br /> <br />A brief non-fiction piece by Stevenson, \\"How I Came to be such a student of our Penny Press,\\" together with some examples of 19th century book advertising... <br /> <br />Three essays about the literary context of \\"Dr. Jekyll\\": Karl Miller, \\"The Modern Double\\": Jenni Calder, \\"Stevenson's Scottish Devil Tales\\"; and Judith Halberstam, \\"An Introduction to Gothic Monstrosity\\"... <br /> <br />Four essays about the scientific context of Stevenson's story: Stephen Jay Gould, \\"Post-Darwinist Theories of the Ape Within\\"; Frederic W. H. Myers, \\"Multiple Personality\\"; Norman Kerr, \\"Abject Slaves to the Narcotic\\"; John Addington Symonds, \\"This Aberrant Inclination in Myself\\"... <br /> <br />Two essays about the socio-historical context of Stevenson's story: Judith R. Walkowitz, \\"London in the 1880s\\"; and Walter Houghton, \\"Hypocrisy\\"... <br /> <br />Three essays and a filmography about theatrical and film adaptations of \\"Dr. Jekyll\\": C. Alex Pinkston, Jr., \\"The Stage Premiere of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\"; Charles King, \\"Themes and Variations\\" (about film); Scott Allen Nollen, \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (Paramount, 1931)\\"; and Katherine Linehan, \\"A Checklist of Major Performance Adaptations\\"... <br /> <br />And five additional critical essays: G. K. Chesterton, \\"The Real Stab of the Story\\"; Vladimir Nabokov, \\"The Phenomenon of Style\\"; Peter K. Garrett, \\"Instabilities of Meaning, Morality, and Narration\\"; Patrick Brantlinger, \\"An Unconscious Allegory about the Masses and Mass Literacy\\"; and Katherine Linehan, \\"Sex, Secrecy and Self-Alienation in Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\". <br />  <br />For sheer range of commentary, I do not think that you could point to a comparable volume. <br />
0812550706|5.0|Most people who have read Ender's Game, and there are a lot of 'em, put this book near the top of their list of favorites.  It has some wide appeal to it that I can't really put my finger on.  The premise of the story is mildly interesting at it's surface... a battle school for genius children to aid in the war against an alien race.  ok.  But, it's just so well told and it has a powerful and suprising ending.  Card must have been \\"in-the-zone\\" when he wrote this book.  It never gets bogged down and you really get drawn into the story and Ender's world and his pysche.  The mind play going on between characters is entrancing.  A fabulous book.
B00005Y7PS|5.0|This album, probably as much as \\"Never Say Die\\" in 1978, marked the end of an epoch for Black Sabbath.  However, whilst the last Osbourne-period album marked the end of one straggling era and the opening of another era of promise, \\"TYR\\" (which Tony Martin is quick to point out \\"rhymes with beer\\"!), in many ways, marked the true end of Black Sabbath as a creative entity.  They would, of course, go on to produce the superb (but ill-fated) \\"Dehumanizer\\" album with the reunited Ronnie James Dio/Vinny Appice line-up.  They (or, precisely, Tony Iommi) would also attempt a return to the form displayed on this album by reconstituting the Tony Martin line-up.  However, the shadow of the \\"old\\" band was always waiting in the wings, and, of course, that's the way things ended up. <br /> <br />I like this album immensely.  This is easily the best album that Sabbath did with Tony Martin, much better lyrically than the overdone pseudo-Satanism of the previous offering, \\"Headless Cross\\".  Also, Iommi had led this line-up (which, of course, included the late, legendary drummer Cozy Powell, his former Whitesnake bass partner Neil Murray, and in-the-shadows keyboardist Geoff Nicholls in addition to Iommi and Martin), out on the road.  They were tight, and it shows on this album.  This really does sound like a BAND album, probably the most since \\"Heaven and Hell\\".  Even though Iommi is still in creative control here, the other band members' creative input is notable, and their musicianship goes without saying.  It is a credit to Iommi that his guitar playing is not the dominant force (though this is somewhat disappointing, given that his guitar work is so inspiring) and that there is a true ensemble feel here thanks to the excellent Iommi/Powell production. <br /> <br />Is it a concept album?  Yes and no.  Yes, with \\"The Battle of Tyr\\", \\"Odin's Court\\" and \\"Valhalla\\" forming a mini-epic, which drew comparisons to Manowar (who themselves have been compared to Sabbath!).  No, because allthe songs stand on their own merits as very strong compositions.  Even the obvious radio-friendly \\"Feels Good to Me\\" doesn't mar the overall excellence of the album (despite a very cheesy video that has nothing to do with the song's lyrics). <br /> <br />Martin is lyrically more obscure here than previously, but I'd rather have that than the obvious pretensions toward what Sabbath \\"should\\" be lyrically that he tried on \\"Headless Cross\\".  His vocals are peerless throughout and he moves out of the shadows of \\"Dio-imitator\\" that many tried to pin on him.  Powell proves himself once again to be the engine of the band in a manner he hadn't done since his Rainbow days.  Neil Murray, whilst not being as fast-fingered as Geezer Butler, is rock-solid.  Geoff Nicholls adds colour where needed.  And Sir Tony Iommi (Her Majesty the Queen should really consider this - he's at least as worthy of it as Mick Jagger or Elton John!)?  As I said previously, he doesn't dominate the proceedings, but he still shows here that there is no one in heavy metal who does riffing, soloing, and songwriting like he does.  After all, he wrote the book! <br /> <br />\\"Anno Mundi (The Vision)\\" - A bit of a mellow opener (until it gets going!) with possibly a political/ecological message?  I'm not really good with Latin but I think a rough translation of the song title could be \\"The Year of the World.\\" <br /> <br />\\"The Law Maker\\" - Powell's pounding introduces the kind of fast, furious rocker that Sabbath have done better than anyone else ever since \\"Heaven and Hell\\". <br /> <br />\\"Jerusalem\\" - Another Powell intro, but more mid-paced classic Sabbath.  Tony Martin remade this on his solo album \\"Back Where I Belong,\\" but I haven't heard that version. <br /> <br />\\"The Sabbath Stones\\" - Tony Martin says this is about God and I think he intends \\"The Sabbath Stones\\" to indicate the Ten Commandments tablets.  Almost religious lyrics here, and, as a Christian I don't mind that at all!  Very good musically as well, with Powell cannoning away as only he could. <br /> <br />\\"The Battle of Tyr\\" - This is an orchestral piece showcasing Geoff Nicholls.  I think that may actually be timpani that Cozy is playing!  If not, it's certainly some very strangely-EQ'd floor toms! <br /> <br />\\"Odin's Court\\" - The Viking atmosphere starts to build here.  Martin stretches his range here effortlessly over Iommi's gentle clean electric guitar. <br /> <br />\\"Valhalla\\" - \\"Odin's Court\\" was almost soothing.  \\"Valhalla\\" is anything but!  Heavy, just the way it should be!  The band locks into a tight groove behind Martin, making this the most propulsive song on the album.  Excellent wah-flavoured Iommi solo as well. <br /> <br />\\"Feels Good to Me\\" - As stated previously, this was the band's attempt at a radio-friendly song, which Tony Martin has freely admitted.  Even so, it's still good enough not to knock any stars off the five-star rating this album richly deserves. <br /> <br />\\"Heaven in Black\\" - This is a very slight detour into \\"Headless Cross\\" lyrical territory, though not as overt.  Could be about Russian history, with mentions of the \\"czar\\".  Cozy's double bass drum intro builds into a fine closer to a fine album. <br /> <br />This album and subsequent tour did very well almost everywhere but in the United States (I think there were only a handful of dates in the U.S., and they weren't publicised at all), where the Ozzy-only cult seemed to cripple anything Black Sabbath tried to do at least after Dio. <br /> <br />I had very high expectations of the band recapturing their glory days when I heard this album, but of course it wasn't to be.  I will always respect Tony Iommi as a musician but I lost some respect for him as an artist when he broke up this very creative line-up to try and return to the \\"old days\\" with first the Dio line-up and ultimately the Ozzy line-up. <br /> <br />But if you have an open mind and want a very strong heavy metal album, you can do a lot worse than \\"TYR\\". <br /> <br />A well deserved five stars. <br />
1559409002|4.0|\\"Carnival of Souls\\" is an odd, Twilight Zone-like movie in which a heady atmosphere compensates for an exceptionally uneven presentation. Yes, I know you've heard that about many other horror films, but \\"Carnival of Souls\\" is one of the few times where such a description is warranted. It's the atmosphere of the film - best likened to an eerie fever dream, that made \\"Carnival of Souls\\" a cult film. The often skillful black and white cinematography turns the often mundane - even banal - locations seem mysterious and even sinister. This doesn't turn the movie into a classic winner, but it does help explain why a public domain movie like this is still remembered today.    Virtually the entire running time of \\"Carnival of Souls\\" is devoted to a moody young church organist (Candace Hilligoss) obsessed with a ruined amusement park not far from her church. Her odd behavior justifiably confuses her sleazy, wannabe boyfriend and as the film progresses her breaks with reality are more and more disjointed. This isn't a standard B-movie stocked full of scares, but a consistently odd, unnerving film. The ending, if anything is anticlimatic. Several scenes in which the organist is being pressured by her boyfriend (Sydney Berger) are actually far scarier than any of the supernatural elements in the film.    The Criterion DVD also includes generous documentaries, galleries, and a \\"director's cut\\" which share more than you need to know about this film. It pushes my rating of the film from 3 stars to four. It's nice to see a B-movie given this respect. However . . .    The main problem with the Criterion DVD is that, no matter how you frame it, this _is_ a DVD of an obscure, uneven B-movie. The cheezy electric, whirling organ score is only occassionally effective and there's little attempt to have Hilligoss mime convincingly to the music on those scenes when she is the organist. Most of the supporting actors are downright terrible, and the film's pacing drags at times. This isn't an \\"art movie\\" no matter what the pretensions of its creators. To be charged nearly 40 dollars for it (even though it has extras and is restored)is a bit excessive, not to mention insulting. If you're a purist, buy a used copy. If you're just want a copy of the film for your collection, there are plenty of other, more inexpensive, versions around, including a colorized one.
6305537321|5.0|This is an absolutely fabulous film; very different from the average story being told in the early sixties.  This is not a sugary love story- this is a witty, humorous, and thought-provoking look at two flawed souls trying to find their way through life.  Hepburn and Peppard have electric chemistry and both deliver lines with snappy wit, fearful sarcasm, and disdainful disregard.  Breakfast at Tiffany's is a cinematic delight- and much more.
0064407667|5.0|Dear Reader,<br /><br />THE BAD BEGINNING is the first of a series of books entitled \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events.\\"  The author, Lemony Snicket (whose real name is Daniel Handler) warns the reader several times: on the back cover of the book, in the opening section of the book, and several times throughout the book; that the book is \\"extremely unpleasant\\" and if you like nice, fluffy, happy stories that you should put the book down and read something else.<br /><br />THE BAD BEGINNING briefly explains how the three Baudelaire children-Violet, Klaus, and Sunny-became orphans, how the first met their evil relative Count Olaf, Count Olaf's first scheme at stealing their money, and how they moved from one series of unfortunate events to another.<br /><br />THE BAD BEGINNING is not the typical \\"children's book.\\" In fact, if a child hasn't been exposed to much classical literature, fairy tales, or life experiences, they probably shouldn't be reading the book at all because it might frighten them by exposing them to all the nastiness in the world.  However, if a child has read any classical literature or fairy tales (where there is all kinds of violence and bad things going on) or has had a lot of life experiences (my grandfather died when I was in the 3rd grade) then they might actually enjoy reading THE BAD BEGINNING.<br /><br />Mr. Snicket has a delightful time with language and a child's vocabulary is sure to increase after having read THE BAD BEGINNING. They also might learn a thing or two (though they might not be able to understand what they learn) about law and justice.  They are sure to find themselves saddened by the unfortunate state of the Baudelaire siblings, yet somewhat uplifted by knowing that as troublesome as their lives might be, the Baudelaire orphans have it much worse.<br /><br />Still, children probably shouldn't be reading THE BAD BEGINNING at all. It's a book that youth in their teens and young adults would probably enjoy and benefit from reading the most. Unfortunately people that age are often ashamed of reading and fear of their lives becoming unfortunate by reading such a book like THE BAD BEGINNING will probably prevent them from learning the lessons found therein. Such a shame. I hope the Baudelaire children find happiness sometime.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Uncle TVg the most.

0765301598|2.0|One steps into this series not expecting the achievement of Dune, an unfairly high standard, but a good read with maybe some flashes of Dune's complexity of character, plot, and philosophy.  The first book of this trilogy, the Butlerian Jihad, failed in the latter two areas but the plot was a good enough read to overcome those flaws.  The second book was a step backward, with the same weak characterization, but this time not balanced by a strongly told story.  The Battle of Corrin,  unfortunately, continues the downward trend.  As in the other books, characterization is almost uniformly shallow, which is tough to do since some of these characters we've seen over the course of several long books now.   Those characters we've seen in prior books don't seem to have developed much and the new characters are mostly two-dimensional.  The plot is weak, mostly an episodic narrative of battles among the three major groups at war (the humans, the cymeks, the robots).  The weakness of the plot is exacerbated by the \\"been there, done that\\" sense of repetition.  It seems the three books could easily have been combined into two, making for a more streamlined, less repetitive narrative.  Not everything needs to be a trilogy (Tolkien be damned).  Another flaw affecting involving both plot and character is that too many actions seem arbitrary or contrived, done more for a plotline than developing out of character.  Some, in fact, seem wholly out of character or simply unbelievable.  Finally, whereas the first book mostly avoided the prequel problem of rote action meant to connect the dots of later books, this one is rolling in it, filled with awkwardly introduced or clumsily handled events/phrases written in so the reader can go \\"ahh, so that's why they call them xxxxxxxx in Dune\\".  Admittedly, it's a tough problem to overcome for any prequel, but seldom have I seen it so poorly handled. <br />  If this were book one I'd definitely recommend against starting the trilogy.  But chances are, if you've reached Battle of Corrin, you're going to read it no matter what just to finish the series and see those connections to later Dune books.  So all I can say is don't expect much, don't feel bad about skimming, and have a good book set aside to dive into when you're done; you're going to want to recapture a good read quickly.
0451526384|5.0|I love all Jane Austen's books, but this is my personal favorite. The way the characters interact is very humerous, but the story is touching. I feel more of a connection to Anne than to any of Austen's other characters, and I love the way she and Wentworth fall in love... again.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Love it or hate it, Michael Moore presents an honest account of the failures and greediness of the Bush administration.    Reviewer John Johnson said: \\"P.S. Conservatives are better in bed look at micheal moore he is fat slob who could not preform like arnold could in bed.\\"    Mr. Johnson can't be TOO conservative to be worrying about Michael and Ah-Nold's sex lives.  He seems a bit too interested.  And he sounds like a big ol homo.  Closet case, closet future liberal.    And Mr. X isn't writing a reasonable review.  That was a reverse psychology review.  What's on the video happened.  It wasn't film manipulation.  It looks like that's the real GWB saying those things, to me!  Facts are facts are facts.  Deal with it!    Don't be jealous of Michael Moore; nor Kerry/Edwards, who has nothing to do with F911.  You so-called \\"conservatives\\" keep your (medical) issues to yourselves.
B00005JNEI|5.0|depend greatly on our own point of view.  Sorry to be quoting old movies but the last few months of blogfests have taught me how true Obi Wan's line was.  Moore has many facts dervied by many papers and stated by many authors.  His critics have the same thing, facts from others that support the opinion they want to express.  More often that not, p[eople will choose who to beleive based on who they WANT to beleive and not question the authenticity of any fact that supports their side.  And to be fair, this applies to both fans and critics of Moore. <br /> <br />This movie (for simple labeling purposes) got mislabeled as a documentary.  It's actually an editorial piece.  The quality of an editorial piece is in it's power to persuade people to it's opinon.  I generally like Moore's movies and books, and generally support his opinion, but the premis of Farenheit rubbed me the wrong way.  It tried to paint Bush as the kind of villan we don't see outside of Satuday morning cartoons or 1960s comic books.  Not to mention the president being involved in vast conspirices for money and world domination seemed so implausible when the last guy with the job could cheat on his wife without it being all over the news. <br /> <br />Watching the move at release was interesting.  It painted a rather convincing picture, and taking into accounts the CBC news I watch, I was finding it harder to completely dismiss the conspiracy theories.  With the more recent news, from studies stating faulty intellegence about WMDs to freudian slips made by Bush during the live debates, from lost explosives to fresh hate mail from Bin Laden, I get afraid Moore may be right.  I'd prefer to think that Bushes less than stellar desicions were made due to a recationaly attitude to the irrational fear we all had after 9/11, but in the grand scheme of things, that isn't any less damning. <br /> <br />This movie is very powerful.  That's something that can't really be denied regardless of your political opinions.  It's simply Moore's version of events.  History will be the one to decide if he's the Pied Piper leading us to our death, or the lone voice chanting the Earth revolves aroung the Sun.  This movie will probably make most of us uncomfortible, and some may dissmiss Fareneheit because of those feelings, but I'm reminded of some words from one of my teachers: \\"If I ever find myself in the position of being 100% ethically corect, I know my thinking's screwed up somewhere.\\"
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Franz Ferdinand is a brilliant band! After hearing this album, I fell in love with them. Every song is great on this album.

B000068IEU|4.0|This movie at some points looks like a home video of physical and mental torture. Just the thought that a group of crazy escaped convicts could easily catch their prey, by offering a stash of pot is a bit disturbing. You don't have to watch the rape of a 17 year old girl to know that it's horrible. At points I was asking myself how could this be a movie. The parts of mari and phyllis are played out perfectly. They seemed like nothing more than cute high school girls going out to the city to watch a shock-rock concert. Whats even more powerful is seeing that the parents are loving and care very much about their daughter. <br />Not only do you feel bad for the two girls, but you feel bad for her parents sitting at home worrying. The small comedic scenes of the movie seem to come out of mercy. It's wes Cravens way of saying that this is only a movie. This doesn't reach the mark of terror that TCM set. However, there are some moments of suspense, and tension that grab you and drag you along.
1587990717|5.0|Yes, must agree with most others in that Taleb's writing style / personality appears to be arrogant. Who says he isn't just selling his options further out of the money than everyone else? (I know, I know, he generally 'buys' them, but my point should be clear for those who have already read the book). Anyway, the point he made that I like the most is that more information is not always better, though most are adamant about keeping abreast every singly piece of media available.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Muse has gone through the rubbish of being compared to Radiohead, which is just terrible. Radiohead doesnt even compare to Muse, and this album shows how Muse is a different band than Radiohead. The music is very catchy and brilliant ofcourse! This album should put an end to the comparing of Muse with Radiohead. Absolution will rock your socks!
B00005QDW5|5.0|Echoes is a compilation that attempts to span a career that is difficult to summarise succinctly. British band Pink Floyd is an entity not unlike fellow rock time-travellers Fleetwood Mac or Yes in that it has been around since the heyday of British psychedelia in the late 60's ,has had several lead vocalists, many changes in artistic style, and many different eras. Today, Pink Floyd appears to be a defunct band, but it enjoys a vast legacy of lifelong fans with fond memories, critical acclaim and a back catalogue that continues to win new fans amongst today's generation. <br /> <br />The result is a disparate collection of best tracks. Some of this is magnificent and unforgettable musical magic, while some is not that wonderful. But if you know the Pink Floyd story , it all makes sense.  <br /> <br />The early stuff from the Syd Barrett era (circa 1966-68) was new to me when I bought my copy of Echoes in 2002. I don't care for this music much, but then I wasn't around in the late 60's, at which time it may well have found favour with the avant garde/ chemically-enhanced set that were in vogue at the time. So I'm not the best judge. See Emily Play is OK , and was a 1967 UK hit at a time when Pink Floyd was a somewhat trippy art-pop group in London.  <br /> <br />The next era of Pink Floyd featured more experimental stuff, which was taken from a bunch of early 70's albums. Echoes is a multi-themes epic that here is cut down to 16 minutes. It's really good. One Of These Days is a groovy instrumental that shows the band learning a few studio tricks. By now, the creative core of bass guitar player / songwriter Roger Waters and guitar player / singer David Gilmour had assumed co-control of the band, along with Richard Wright on keyboards, and drummer Nick Mason.  <br /> <br />Pink Floyd however remained on the fringes of popular recognition with their music appealing mainly to what would now be termed an \\"indie\\" audience of rock listeners in the early 70's and their songs bypassing radio as they refused to issue radio-friendly cuts.  <br /> <br />In 1973 , this changed irrevocably with their undisputed masterwork Dark Side Of The Moon. This is a touchstone of our collective popular culture, as its themes of time, money, death, madness and conflict are universal, and their realisation as classic songs has seen this become an all-time favourite album of millions of people. Us And Them is magnificent songcraft with soft verses and loud choruses, and deals with fighting. Time hits the mark exactly with its commentary on the modern rush of progress leaving us all \\"hanging on in quiet desperation\\" , while Money tackles the other side of the equation with its biting lyrics exposing the greed that drives our overconsumptive society. <br /> <br />The Wish You Were Here album of 1975 was dominated by the title tune - another melodic classic with great lyrics by Waters. Shine On You Crazy Diamond appears here as an epic 7-part piece. It's about the psychosis of their former bandmate Syd Barrett.  <br /> <br />Animals (1977) is represented by the 9-minute track Sheep, which is not a favourite of mine, but which I know many other reviewers like. Pink Floyd had become giant-sized stadium concept rockers by this time, and alienation, excess, and fame pressures took an emotional toll on Roger Waters (and presumably the others too). Waters made up the idea for The Wall (1979) - an ambitious psychodrama that Pink Floyd did as a double album of closely-linked songs, that became a vast touring show in 1980 and an unsettling, vivid feature film in 1982. The Wall has some awesome songs on it, along with the sort of narrative song-fragments that link together musicals and operatic projects. This set excerpts their best track Comfortably Numb - an amazing performance on guitar by Gilmour and shared vocals with  Gilmour and Waters makes this tale of mental disturbance/delirium mixed with reverie perhaps the defining Pink Floyd song for me. The anti-authoritarian chant of Another Brick In The Wall (part 2) demanded single release in 1979 and reached #1 on the pop charts. It appears here with the prologue Happiest Days Of Our Lives (not!!), while the minor-key song Hey You wonderfully conveyed feelings of isolation and disconnection from the world.  <br /> <br />Roger Waters contributed the autobiographical piece When The Tigers Broke Free (about his father) and the satirical The Fletcher Memorial Home before departing in acrimony after 1983's The Final Cut album and taking with him the vein of misanthropy that had begun to creep into their last two studio projects. <br /> <br />David Gilmour thus assumed creative control, and from then on we have tracks from 1987's A Momentary Lapse Of Reason and 1994's The Division Bell. I do like High Hopes, which is ominous, sad and rather beautiful , and Learning To Fly - a rock radio hit. These latter-day records are sonically grand and of high quality , but again represent a distinctively-different era of the band, with Gilmour singing almost every song. My favourite song from this era is the beautiful humanitarian ballad On The Turning Away (1987), but it's not on this set.  <br /> <br />An uneven set then , but unquestionably brilliant at times, thought-provoking and intelligent rock music. It's the best thing to buy if you want an overview of all Pink Floyd's best-known pieces.  <br /> <br />Highly Recommended!!
B000000LZV|5.0|This is a truly great record.  I like indie, love this album.  My drummer likes harder stuff, loves this album.  My wife likes Disney music and loves this album.  This is just three great players playing what they want to play, which may not sound very punk, but I don't think they or I care.  Mike Watt says \\"Punk is what we made it to be\\" and what he and D and George made here is one of the best, most enduring albums ever.  I've had this for 15 years and keep coming back to it - no other album has held my attention so much or so long.  Do not deny yourself the chance to experience this.
B0002SROT0|5.0|Elliott Smith has left an indelible mark on the music world with some of his finest work yet.  From a Basement on a Hill, with every song...with every note, captures the very essence of what true art should be.  He poured his broken heart and the longing of his soul into this masterpiece.  I heard a man that was so racked with the torments of \\"fakeness\\" (as J.D. Salinger would put it) that he was inevitably overcome with cynicism and depression.  This album is absolutely THE must buy album of the year and will undoubtedly go down as one of the best albums of the decade.  Every track is a highlight, however, one in particular climbed this Everest of an album and sparkled above the rest.  \\"King's Crossing\\" is perhaps the most heartfelt, truth bearing, haunting song I have ever heard im all my life.  I couldn't help but put it on repeat and listen over and over and over again.  If you are thinking about buying this album...I can guarantee that you will not be sorry.  Elliott Smith has always come through in fine fashion giving such delights XO and Figure 8, but this album eclipses even the brilliance displayed in those fine works of musical genius.

B00015TNCU|4.0|This cd has quite a few nice tracks on it. I'm not the biggest fan of michael jackson in the world but this cd was considerably good. It had a nice blend of slow songs along with a couple of nice dance numbers.. like thriller and beat it. Overall I thought that this was a good buy and a treat for michael jackson fans out there.
B0000844IT|5.0|You have got to love this move.  Over the top, loud, and very funny, this movie is for watching with the family on a friday night.  No nudity, the language is a tad violent, but not vulgar, and the story is hillarious.  One of the best funny horror flicks ever made. to be honest the horror aspect of this movie is almost non-existant.  Ash a sporting goods clerk from the 20th century is cast back to middle ages England.  There he must fight the evil army of the undead.  The undead are muphets more or less.  The video game \\"Duke Nukem\\" took all of it's dialog from this movie.  This movie will make you laugh you butt off!   \\"Hail to the king...Baby!\\"
0060090383|5.0|Excellent! This is another one of Ms. Keyes's books that is better than all the drivel I've ever read in all the self-help books put together. Keep up the good work!
0780020685|5.0|Wow!  It is a very old movie. It is a very good movie.  The story is simple. A village needs to be protected from outlaws.  They hire Samurai to defend themselves.  The line between Outlaw and Samurai in 19th century Japan is a fine one, should the villagers fear the outlaws or the Samurai that they have hired?  An amazing movie, I'm dissapointed that Japanese Cinemma never fully developed into a more powerful force in todays movie industry.  Their culture is alien enough to be fresh, but familiar enough to remind us of our own wild west.  A great movie that the SERIOUS movie buff would be honored to have in his/her collection.
0060989157|4.0|This book reads like a disaster movie. Just when you think things can't get any more disgusting, gross or tragic, the Generation Swine that is Motley Crue finds something more outrageous and depraved. \\"The Dirt\\" is rock history with fungus unscraped. From their beginnings as basically a teenage rock band as street thugs, the four members of Motley Crue describe in distinct detail how they drugged themselves to the top of the 80's glam metal heap.<br /><br />What keeps \\"The Dirt\\" from turning into rock, dope, record, repeat is that Neil Strauss has the good sense to get quips from managers, record execs, producers and others that passed through the Motley Crue mangler. It helps provide alternate voices to the self absorbed shenanigans that the band parades through on page after page. It sometimes gets hard to believe that these guys didn't catch something really dirty. (Robbin Crosby of Ratt is frequently mentioned in \\"The Dirt\\" as a Crue party pal. He succumbed to AIDS in 2002, likely catching it from the needles he used to shoot up Heroin.)<br /><br />Lest you think that \\"The Dirt\\" is a totally egocentric slimeglide, you also get to catch glimpses of humanity in the human wreckage inside the band. Vince Neil gives the book an emotional grounding when he describes the agony of watching his 4 year old daughter, Skylar, succumb to cancer. You begin to understand why Nikki was just rebelling against everything as a response to his childhood abandonment. It hardly excuses their rampant antisocial behavior, but it does make for a page turner of a rock book.<br /><br />Just don't pick this up if you're in the least bit prudish. You'll never think of 80's Hair Bands the same way again.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Star Wars, it was a break through movie on a number of levels. It began the trend of summer \\"Block busters\\", it spawned the rampant merchandizing associated with \\"kids\\" movies, and it blew our little minds with it's massive array of new images and epic story scope.  In your head you remember Star Wars, but you really don't remember it.  Watching these movies again reminds you of why Star Wars was such an incredible movie. The special effects seem a tad dated, the light saber duals that seemed so awesome, now seem pretty lame, and some of the acting is pretty poor.  However the flavor, the adult/child storyline, and impressive character development bowl you over.
B00005JL96|5.0|My little cousin and her \\"kiddie club\\" has watched this movie over fifty times and still counting! I have been \\"invited\\" to watch the action on at least a dozen visits.  This is one movie that I enjoy because Lilo is so sweet yet adventurous.  Stitch is cute and humourous as well.  Its such a cute, wholesome Disney production!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Star Wars is etched in the Cinema landscape as the film that changed the movie industry forever.  Some people hate it for that, but no one can deny how much it opened the doors to more exciting and creative movies.  Only 2001: A Space Odyssey had centered it's subject matter in space.      Back in 1977, Star Wars premiered with clunky, but still start of the arts, effects.  It's characters were like nothing ever seen before and the cantina scene could be compared to nothing at the time.  Now, with the dusk of the newest generation of Star Wars movies quickly approaching, George Lucas has taken his prize possession and made it what he always wanted it to be.  Whether you like it or not is totally your own opinion.  Personally, the only flaw I can see is the `Greedo shoots first' scenerio, and this is only because it doesn't look good.  No matter how much technology they throw at that scene, it doesn't look right.      Other than that, everything else is spectacular.  The additional scenes, creatures, vehicles and cityscapes; to me they all add to this world that Lucas wanted so badly to create in 1975 but couldn't due to lack of budget and distrust of the material.  Personally, I love it.  There should be an extra ten minutes of CGI dogfighting scenes in the final battles.  There should be a long panning shot of the cantina showing the managerie of creatures that he envisioned.  I just wish they could get the puppet Jaba to look as good as the CGI one.  Yes, there is texture and reality to the puppet version, but c'mon, he only swayed back and forth when he moved.  If they could mix both technologies somehow, couldn't it work?      All of this is creative, and it's George's work (and world), and we just get to play in it.  Everything else about the movies stands firm.  The characters, the story line, the plot; nothing else has changed.  To say that you want the old version back is like saying you would rather have the old 65 Mustang that is beat up and not maintainedvs. the completely restored 65 Mustang.       In any case, to each his own.  I bought this Trilogy on DVD the day it came out, I saw Star Wars in the theater when I was seven years old and it has been my ultimate dream to have a Lightsaber and use the ways of the force (c'mon I was seven, anyone would have).  Some people would think that's geeky but I bet they would change their tune if they saw someone try to mug you when you're armed with a three meter laser sword.      In true progressive nature, George Lucas has upped the bar on his creation with completely digital sound and picture.  This movie looks fantastic and sounds just as good.  I can't wait to get a wide screen TV to see how it looks.  The 150 minute documentary on what it took to make all three movies is almost worth the price of the set alone.  But there are three other shorter documentaries that are very well done too.  One in particular that displays Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christiansen practicing their lightsaber dual for Episode 3.  It looks like this one is gonna be quite intense.      This trilogy is timeless, no matter how many additional CGI creatures, vehicles and spaceships Lucas superimposes to the original track.  In the end, it's all about adding to the strong story that is already there.  The Good vs. Evil bloodline is still there.  The excitement and escapism of another world is ready to be experienced.  George Lucas created something that has stayed with us for over 25 years and will keep going, no matter what anyone thinks of the new movies, or the changes made to the old ones.
6305841861|5.0|COMMENTS  ABOUT THE  SPECIAL \\"BOOK OF THE DEAD\\"  EDITION:  Jan 2006.  As far as I am aware, there are at least 3 versions of the DVD for EVIL  DEAD 2.Apart from the Very Cool Book look for the special  edition I bought, I have the VHS  tape of the film with the \\"Skull\\"  face on it.  The most amazing plus of this  DVD  is the 5.1 audio, which makes use of all 5 channels  as well as the Sub-Woofer. Up loud, this film is potentially very scarey, and whilst I had obviously noticed the comedic  elements, I had never considered that the comedy might be the raison detre of the film; overall, I still think that the Horror-Comedy tag is correct, since most good Horror films need to be paced, otherwise the film just fails to scare.  The commentary is very revealing. Whilst I have continually enjoyed multiple viewings, I had never noticed the sneak references to other horror icons that the commentary refers  to in the special  feature.  Whilst the Special \\"Book\\" edition I am referring to in this review is about the unrated  edition, it appears some edited editions, may skip certain items ( like the British Edition).  The Commentary is brilliant, and reveals a great deal, and shows just how much fun the group had in creating this work. I can but wonder if Ted Raimi is perpetually thin thanks to this film, or in spite of it :-).  However you see this film, its a great work, and shows plenty of Sam Raimi's style, and Bruce's agility.  ENJOY.  ********************    After watching the film again for the umpteenth time, and hearing the commentary, as well as seeing the \\"Making of...\\"   feature, it is just proof positive that a film by Sam Raimi is great despite faults.  It seems like Sam can run on the sniff of on oily rag, as far as motivation goes, and wow how that takes him a LONG  way.  After doing so much with so little, it is not a surprise that with a larger budget, Raimi can do wonders.  Anyways, check out the making of feature, as well as the commentary... the extras makethis a gem on DVD.  This film is great on VHS, but wow is it an awesome gem in this special  edition package.
B0002SROT0|5.0|I've never felt compelled to write a review until i heard \\"from a basement on the hill\\". This is definite classic album and is a must get for anyone. Tragic but beautiful as always it is an amasing last album to remember Elliott by. If your thinking of buying it you will not be dissapointed.
B0000028M7|5.0|This is the Bible of all rock albums that came out in the 90's, and for years to come for that matter.  Alice In Chains made a flawless album that holds you from start to finish, which is something very few bands can do or even do again.  From the mixture of Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell's voice, to the dark heavy guitar sounds, to the detailed imagery that paints the darkest picture, this is the definitive, this is DIRT.  From the first \\"Ahhh\\" that kicks you in the face on \\"Them Bones\\" to the beautiful harmonies of \\"Down In A Hole\\", it's a listen that never gets old, as fresh to my ears as the day I bought it back in '92.  Is there a bad song on this cd?...NO  The songwriting by Jerry and Layne are at it's strongest and there are so many classics here: 'Sickman', 'Angry Chair', 'Junkhead' and for all it was played out 'Would' is still a great track.  So don't think about it anymore, just buy it, or re-buy if you sold it, you need to OWN this.  It's Led Zepplin 4 for our generation, wait and see.
B000268QB2|5.0|I agree with the reviewer that said this hasn't left their Discman in 2 weeks. I CANNOT bring myself to take it out of my CD player, and I embarrassingly sing along at the top of my lungs the whole time I am in my car. These are moving songs, people! Very introspective. \\"Everybody's changing\\" is my new theme song.  <br /> <br />I am in love with Keane, both in their music and their looks. I can't wait to hear more and more from them in the future.
B00005JLEJ|5.0|the spectacle of war and clan politics are the centerpiece of this feudal tale. really sympathized with the double all the way, i suppose this was kurosawa's intent. the historicity and ancient setting detaches, but shingen's shadow warrior re-connects us to the message; the shadow warrior is a petty thief, cynical of authority, we see a part (if not all) of us in him.     the last scene and final shot are breathtaking.
B000002IGP|5.0|Los Angeles' Ratt. Ahhh yes, the yin to Motley Crue's L.A. yang. The band with a singer that was constantly hidden behind aqua-netted shag (did Stephen Pearcy even have eyes?) and a sound that convinced millions that Aerosmith had started wearing women's clothing. Ratt was one head-bangin' band in 1984 and their smoldering debut LP served up a handful of songs that threated to rip the fabric right off of your parents speakers. A quick listen to this album today reveals that while aesthetically, Ratt has in no way dated well, their sound was indeed the real deal. Armed with hooks that could hang with the best of them and guitar solos that sounded like Warren DeMartini's guitar had been sitting on a stove, Ratt's sound was state-of-the-art hair metal (still a progressive concept in 1984). While \\"Round and Round\\" grabbed the attention of radio, it also denied songs like \\"Lack of Communication\\" and \\"Back for More\\" the acclaim that they deserved. Interestingly, the opener \\"Wanted Man\\" explodes with huge power chords that seem to be announcing Ratt's dominance on the sunset-strip (albeit briefly), while the song's \\"cowboy/outlaw\\" lyrical material   (handed down from Aerosmith) soon became a reigning commonality in L.A. metal's radio anthems. The sleeper song on the album and also perhaps it's grittiest (perhaps even best) is the Robbin Crosby-penned \\"I'm Insane\\", which pounds fervently with a punkish-attitude that gives Pearcy's lyrics an air of credibility (something he didn't always have). \\"Out of the Cellar\\" stands as Ratt's finest LP and a true gem in the L.A. metal genre. Those who can get past the album's dated quality and the band's gruesome looks will be rewarded with energetic and youthful tunes that threatened to conquer Los Angeles in 1984. They don't make them like this anymore.
B000060OFT|5.0|No remake of any Shakespeare play has ever been as well done as this one.  Romeo and Juliet is a visual feast with outstanding performances by every single cast member.   <br /> <br />Traditionalists who believe this is a horrible film are not looking at this with an open mind.  This movie was made to interest a whole new generation of people.  If that is the MTV generation, which is an outdated term too, so be it.  IS that so bad?   <br /> <br />The actors spoke their lines so fluently that no one who has ever read Romeo and Juliet could possibly be confused. <br /> <br />This film is a masterpiece that is beautifully shot, beautifully performed, that has a perfect soundtrack, and all in all is a wonderful interpretation that should be celebrated for its genius. <br /> <br />
B00008CLOA|5.0|There is no words to explain or to justify this album.  This was the first introduction I had with Pink Floyd and from this they gain a lifetime lover of their music.  I only regret I couldn't have experience them \\"live\\" in concert.  Driving and listening to this cd or any other cd by them, especially \\"Animal or Wish You Were Here\\" helps my mind come to terms with the thoughts I have.
B00030590I|2.0|First, while I can't explain it, this movie is like a piece of mainland China propaganda directed at Taiwan.  If they hadn't lost me before the ending of the movie (And they definitely did), they would have lost me with how they concluded it.  It tried too hard to be artistic over everything else and suffers for it.  Perhaps 2 stars is 1 too many.
B000003TA4|5.0|What's all this talk about Nirvana killing rock and roll and selling out to the masses? It became popular and Nirvana couldn't be your little secret indie-cool pet band anymore, get over it! It was overhyped and overplayed but that was over a decade ago, and can't you forgive them for at least trying something new? Who sounded like this? Not the Pixies, not Husker Du, not even Killing Joke who sued them for nicking the riff from \\"Eighties\\" in \\"Come As You Are\\" and won, not the Replacements, not the Melvins, not anybody. Kurt was influenced by a lot of bands, and I'm glad he shifted away from the grunge Bleach sound and pulled this album off. It's a fairly clean-sounding album, but it's very consistant. Doesn't matter if it's commercial, Nirvana was quite good at it and there's a lot of soul in these songs, why should it matter if it's number 1 on the charts? The songwriting is good, the sound is huge and everything's clear. Think about all the crappy music people put up with in popular music of today and people are still complaining about Nirvana? That's completely absurd! I think Nevermind's the most consistant Nirvana album, but In Utero is produced better and comes quite close.
0312305060|1.0|I really wanted to like this book, but I couldn't get past the feeling that the author thinks he's writing something important.  All the details and observations about the characters remind me of the writings of a 15 year old who feels they've got the world figured out.  I think the details may have been an attempt to avoid writing a short story.
B00000JCOV|1.0|There is a common misconception that Slipknot are THE heavy metal band, that they're the heaviest there is and the best that there is. That's not true. What is true is that Slipkot simply talk fast, which has no place in music. Don't get me wrong, I love metal more than anything else, but I hate Slipknot. Slipknot's instruments sound more like a lot of metal bins being beaten with distressed cats. They are trying to be heavy, which really restricts their music. Seriously avoid, do not fall to this level. The only people I know that like them only do to fit in with the crowd. Music's about expressing yourself. Don't do it with this. If you really want to listen to something heavy, then try out some Cryptopsy, Morbid Angel, The Berzerker or The Red Chord. That'll shut you up and put you in line.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|<br />First off, I have to say that the director's commentary on this disc is the best damn commentary I have heard. Guillermo del Toro tells it just the way it is without any apologies. He is definitely my kind of director, and I am so glad that he has earned the well-deserved credit he needs in Hollywood to keep making his films the way he damn feels like making them. <br /> <br />Secondly, this is not Shakespeare ladies and gents. Simply, it is balls-out one of the best \\"Dirty Dozen\\" type action film to grace the screen in a while.  <br /> <br />It is about the allegiances that a band of misfits must form in order to conquer over the greater evil. There are so many relationships that are formed/severed as the result of each characters action. The main characters need to re-examine who they are considering where they came from. For example, Blade's struggle against his true nature continues as Nyssa's faith in the vampire bloodline becomes questionable. The villain Nomak delivers one of the best lines to Blade as: Is the enemy of my enemy my friend, or my enemy? <br /> <br />Film highlights: <br /> <br />* If you have not seen the first film, watch this one instead; it gives you a nice re-cap of events and has a much stronger, tighter pacing.  <br /> <br />* Blade 2 is to Blade 1 what Aliens was to Alien. It starts off with a bang right away, and it does not let up. Let us just hope that Blade 3 does not turn out like Alien 3.  <br /> <br />* Ron Perlman is great as always; insanely perfect choice for casting him as Hellboy by the way. If you have not already seen \\"Chronos\\", also starring Ron Perlman, check it out. It's Guillermo del Toro's other \\"vampire\\" film. Keep in mind that Chronos is much more \\"soulful\\" than \\"action-packed\\". <br /> <br />* Wesley Snipes kicks so much ass, it's a good thing the boots he is wearing are steel-toed.  <br /> <br />* If you liked Batman & Robin, you probably won't like this movie.  <br /> <br />* If you liked Batman & Robin andyou feel you can compare that movie to Blade 2, you may have had a lobotomy. <br /> <br />* Obligatory \\"bad dudes walking down the street (headed towards a big fight) in slow-motion\\" scene is great!!!   <br /> <br />* Makes a great gift for bloodthirsty dads on Father's Day! <br /> <br />Recently I sent Guillermo del Toro a pair of slightly used socks. He knocked them off with this movie, so they belong to him now. Well done Guillermo; display them proudly. <br />
B000002J1B|5.0|This is a superb album and one which has stood the test of time. The first track, the epic \\"Gates of Delirium\\", is one of the best pieces of music ever produced by Yes. It is simply awesome. The musicianship on this album is amazing and the music itself is a heady amalgam of rock and jazz. This will not be the most accessible album for some, but perseverence will pay off! This was another album which the critics hated and the fans loved - sorry critics, but the fans know best! This is a classic.
B00005JNEU|5.0|I had heard nothing but good things about \\"Friday Night Lights\\" before going to see the film for myself.  As a teenager, I attended a school with a similiar love of football, so this movie really hit home for me.  \\"Friday Night Lights\\" manages to take the viewer into the action better than most football movies to date.<br /><br />The movie starts off a little fuzzy, adding the documentary type effect, but after a third of the movie has passed, it takes on a more professional Hollywood big film feel.<br /><br />The acting is good.  The storyline is not only true but works well on the big screen.  Billy Bob Thorton, besides having been married to the most beautiful woman in the world, is a also a great actor.  He does a great job not over-acting in this film.  Many actors would have not have been able to pull this role off.  But Billy Bob makes the true-life character Coach Gary Gaines come across quite well.<br /><br />The on-the-field scenes are very realistic, and the movie manages to throw in \\"touching\\" moments and a few \\"funny\\" parts.  All of the young actors did a great job of making the situations seem believable and also managed to not over-act their parts.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie top any football fan.  It delivers the goods.<br /><br />For parents...their are a few sexually explicit scenes, so use discretion.  Send little ones for popcorn when the scene starts to get a little heavy.<br /><br />See ya next review
B000002J20|5.0|This album was years ahead of its time and perhaps the closest Yes got to creating a prog rock symphony in four movements. The critics didn't like it much, but most of the fans did. The debate about the music still goes on, so the best thing to do is buy it, listen to it, and make up your own mind. Yes still play sections of this album in their live set and this is always well received. It was a brave and ambitious thing to deliver such a musical statement to the listening public in the 1970s, but Yes had the balls and first-class musicianship to do just that. It was never going to be easy to top 'Close to the Edge' or 'Fragile', but this album did lead to 'Relayer' which is arguably one of the band's finest moments.  It's an extraordinary achievement, despite the commercial and musical risks taken. It did Yes no harm, particularly in Britain when the album shot to No.1 upon its release.  I retain a fondness for this album which has lasted for over 30 years, and I'm not bored with it yet!
014028009X|2.0|Bridget's discomfort in the company of `smug marrieds' is something I can relate to, as a single woman myself. But while I tend to tell these people to mind their own, Bridget gets dragged down by what she so evidently feels is a failing of hers - that she doesn't have a boyfriend. Although I appreciate that relationships are important, it irritates me that this capable young woman doesn't get on with her life and stop making it such a feature. I do think Helen Fielding did a good job with the structure of this book. But the fact that it's been such a hit must surely say that so many young women are also at home with a bottle of white whingeing about being single, instead of doing things that would get them more of a social life (and perchance a fella!). I for one wouldn't chase Bridget if I were a man - I'd feel that I could just about anyone under forty and it would be a turn-off. <br />
B0000524CY|1.0|'The Exorcist' is a really silly movie.  Who in the 21st century believes in devils and demons, and who would actually be scared by such nonsense?  Why has the devil decided to possess this little girl?  Why doesn't the devil possess somebody powerful so he can influence other people and take over the world?  What is the devil trying to achieve by taking over the little girl?  The movie doesn't answer such important questions.<br /><br />A lot of the movie is just shock value.  There is no substance underneath.  In 1973 this may have been scary, but now it looks ridiculous.  Hopefully, trash like this can disappear and be forgotten over time.
B000148KK2|2.0|I admire all artists of the caliber of Krall and I respect them taking a new adventurous side road.  However, this album is not for me. Krall has had me spending money for years but if this keeps up I'll have to find another performer to perform the music I prefer.
0812550706|5.0|I'm less than a chapter from finishing the book... Everyone tells me there's some big unexpected surprise. I really want to know....but I don't want the magic to end. I know I will read the whole series. Great book, great author. I recommend it for all.
0060987464|5.0|I have always been a big Manson fan, not just of him but his whole band. So i really wanted to read about him and find his story and some way to further understand his lyrics. This book was the answer. I don't read a lot/I hardly ever finish books. I read this book in a week! Its so addictive I was reading it during classes. It is so beautifully written and when you read it, its hard to believe that THIS is manson taking/writing this. He talks about his childhood, relationship with his parents, band members and lovers. It takes you to the core of Manson to when he was Brain Warner and you understand his transformation. And because this is Manson, its DEAD honest, like right to the point. Its so surreal and interesting. It also mentions Trent Reznor and   how the band started. After you read it you start looking at the world differently. Like his music, this book blows your mind...
B00003CXCQ|1.0|My rating applies to Disney's DVD policy rather than this Movie. Because of Disney's stupid limited release policy, generations of children will not be able to purchase certain DVDs. Snow White was released in 2001 and put in the \\"vault\\" in 2002. A child born later than 2002 will not see Snow White on DVD in a store for atleast a decade. So much for experiencing Snow White in the magical years. The nimrods who came up with this anti-consumer policy need to be put in a vault. DISNEY wake up! Release ALL the Disney classic movies on DVD and keep them in stores. If you really cared about children experiencing Disney Magic, you would dump this wrong-headed policy!!!
0671027387|4.0|For 500+ pages, Dan Brown's Deception Point keeps you very interested throughout with interesting fact-based data, and extremely clever plot direction. This is overall an extremely successful story that could do no more to capture the reader's attention right from the beginning and throughout. For a layperson who is not directly, or even remotely associated with any of the government agencies writen about, or to the political behavior of real life people in government, this story is truly believable, and strikes both enthusiasm and fear into a readers' minds about how the world is really run.<br /><br />Rachael Sexton is the daughter of the U.S. Senator running for president against the incumbent President Zach Herney. The sitting president is a devout backer of the Space Program, and it seems this trait of his will tank him in the upcomming elections. His achilles heel will be used against him by his own opponent, unless NASA makes a discovery that would make all the money the United States has ever spent on the program worth while. A discovery has been made, and the Senator knows nothing about it.<br /><br />Racheal, the Senator's semi-estranged daughter walks the fine line between working directly under the sitting president, and being the daughter of his opponent. She is the most important piece to both of their campaigns. Does she survive either of them after she finds out what NASA has discovered?<br /><br />You'll definitely enjoy the book, I would suggest it only to people who are intested in the obvious subject matter. I only give this book 4 stars because the plot is very linear. There is only one plot to which all the characters are attached, and the book is virtually played through very simply. Not a bad thing, but not a literary work of art either.
B000002H2H|5.0|I think this is definitely Metallica's best album. Now don't get me wrong, I like all of Metallica's stuff (except for post-Black Album stuff), but this is really what its all about. Eight minute masterpieces, two minute guitar solos, and Creeping Death. The songs are incredible. Here's the lowdown:<br />Fight Fire With Fire...4/5...This is a good song that starts off classical, and then fires it up<br />Ride The Lightning...5/5...Now THIS is Metallica. Listen to this, Black Album fan wannabe's<br />For Whom The Bell Tolls...5/5...Great song that rolls off bells ringing, then rips off your head and sh ts down your neck<br />Fade To Black...5/5...Blows your mind<br />Trapped Under Ice...5/5...Easily the best song on the album. Right up there with Creeping Death<br />Escape...4/5...No my favorite song, but still pretty good<br />Creeping Death...5/5...I think the title speaks for itself<br />Call of the Ktutu...5/5...Instrumental. Might be a turn off to some, but it shouldn't be<br />In conclusion, this is a manditory for all true-metal fans. If your into Death Metal - believe me, so am i - then this is still your good stuff. <br />Keep Shredding<br />Jack Metal
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I remember always making fun of my mother for watching the Gilmore Girls, but that was before I really gave the show any change at all.  Now the Girlmore Girls is one of only 4 shows I watch every week (the other 3 being Smallville, the Simpsons and Southpark).   <br /> <br />The Gilmore Girls is one of the most intelligent and hilarious shows I've ever watched.  The rapid fire manner in which the entire cast communicates seems so weird at first, but eventually you get used to it and the dialogue flows better and more realistically than most reality shows.  The casting on this show is also trememendous with a few exceptions.  Suki (please excuse my spelling of characters names) sucks.  She's an obnoxious stupid cook who is so darn annoying!  Lane is interesting, but barely in the show enough to matter, and all of Rory's Chilton friends are shallow and 2-dimensional largely because the actors playing them are no good.  The Gilmores themselves, including Grandma and Grandpa are amazingly fun to watch though.  The lead roles (including Luke) are hilarious and enjoyable in basically every episode.  You really can't help but love this series, and I'm sorry mom for always making fun of you about it.  You were 100% right, the Gilmore Girls is awesome!!!
B00001QEE7|5.0|I've read that there are bootleg and fake versions of this DVD floating around Amazon.com, particularly because this DVD is out-of-print and consequently difficult to find.<br /><br />I love this movie, and I'm trying to find out whether this DVD contains the movie in its original dimensions and 1989 form.  Amazon.com fails to mention whether this DVD has had enhancements or dimensions modifications.  I hope not.
B00005YUPO|5.0|We have several of these videos now, but this is still my favorite; maybe because it was the first one.
B000000OUE|5.0|Best album by Zombie ever.  The songs pump through your veins and get your adrenaline pumping.  The lyrics are funny if you don't take them seriously, and the music is incredible.  Highlights are Blur The Technicolor (my favorite song), Super-charger heaven, Electric Head 1 &2, I, Zombie.  The Rob Zombie Albums had some good songs, especially the song Scum of the Earth, but the albums don't even compare to this.
B00000099Y|5.0|In order to fully understand AEnima, you must realize that it is more than just an album; it's a work of art.  That being said, I will continue with my review.  AEnima is a great collection of music from Tool, and it harbors some of their finest work.  Songs like \\"Stinkfist\\", \\"Eulogy\\", \\"Push*t\\" and the  explosive and undeniably classic \\"H.\\" are all great compositions that express what the band is all about: powerful instrumentation (especially the percussion), breathtaking vocals, and cryptic lyrics that actually make you think.  Then of course, there's AEnema, in which Maynard expresses his distaste for L.A. in a not-so-subtle manner.  Although this song is not as deep as its counterparts, it's still a great piece of music.  The Cd is not perfect and has its flaws, such as the fact that nearly half of the songs on the album are either intros, outros, or filler tracks.  Also, the song \\"Third Eye\\" is an example of too much of a good thing: it's got a great melody, but it's just too long.  Despite this, AEnima is an overall great Cd and deserves five stars.
B00005A46T|5.0|This is a bold statement, but I wanted to get your attention.  I am talking in terms of nu metal, not metal metal.  This album absolutely kicks(...) from beginning to end.  It is offensive, and vulgar, and I love it.  People say this is the worst Slipknot album, but I must disagree.  There is no \\"worst\\" Slipknot album, because every effort has been different.  If I had to give the \\"worst\\" title to any album, it would be Subliminal Verses.  Don't get me wrong, that is a bad ass album, but it is not as heavy as their last two efforts.  Trust me, buy this album, and give it a chance.
B00014K5TQ|4.0|This is not strictly a horror movie, however it is pretty horrific. Macauley Culkin plays David Agil, the 1980s party promoter behind the success of the Limelight in NY.  In the first minute, he kills someone and then tells his best friend (Seth Green) all about it. They argue over whose story this is.   <br /> <br />Pretty amazing acting by both. We got the child star who is still childlike (wasn't he a buddy for Michael Jackson back in the day?) and Green whose acting chops are amazing (I'm having a hard time not thinking he's gay and effeminate after watching this). <br /> <br />The movie is good, really good.  Very wierd to see Culkin play off of straight-faced (wooden-faced) Dylan McDermott. <br /> <br />
B00007BHOE|5.0|Best Music DVD production next to a Metallica DVD production.  The show is amazing, the sound quality is amazing, and the special features are awesome.  They did not leave anything out on this DVD.  We all can hear the same songs over and over again, but what makes the DVD special is the drum solo (you can't hear that on an album.)  They play their best songs in this peformance, and i tell you what, his voice sounds great in every song.
B00007GZQI|5.0|this movie was fantastic. i liked it so much that the day i saw it, i went home and ordered it online. it's definately my new favorite movie. i especially recomend this to fans of monty python, ringo starr or anyone who fancies english humor, which we all know is pretty damn good... BUY THIS MOVIE NOW!
B000005S0E|4.0|Due to some turmoil within the band, \\"The Top\\" was more or less a solo album for a very shroomed up Robert Smith. There's no underlying theme either - it's the musical equilvalent to throwing paint at a wall.    There's scary monsters like \\"Shake Dog Shake\\" (an awesome, intense opener), the nightmarish \\"Give Me It\\" (the most frightening Cure song ever), and the freakish \\"Bananafishbones\\" (blues meets psychedelia meets goth).    But there's also some great pop songs, like the shimmering, colorful \\"Caterpillar\\", the cutesy wutsey \\"Dressing Up\\", and the dark, druggy pop of \\"Piggy in the Mirror\\".    And the bittersweet \\"Birdman Girl\\" (a mid-tempo pop song with a slight latin feel) is one of Robert's most sublime compositions.     Other highlights include the droning \\"Wailing Wall\\" and the eerie, unsettling title track.    Because it's out of print, \\"The Top\\" is something of a long lost treasure, containing some of Robert's best songs that are forever doomed for obscurity. Oh well.    Best Songs: Shake Dog Shake, Bird Mad Girl, Bananafishbones, The Top, Wailing Wall.
B000026258|5.0|This is Reich's greatest composition and the one that established his reputation. <br /> <br />The piece is based on a series of static background harmonies that are colored by Reich's estimable sonic hues. Each section elaborates a set of fixed tones in which different instruments play individual notes or groups of notes in different repeating rhythms. That might sound either very simple or overly academic, depending on your viewpoint, but the result is breathtaking.  <br /> <br />Reich is able to get his ensemble of instruments and voices to pulse and breathe like a human/machine hybrid: human in its ebbs and flows, mechanical in its precision. The sounds are quite unlike any other piece and its newness (especially consider how Reich writes for the voice) is still striking.  <br /> <br />If you are at all interested in Minimalism, this is THE composition to hear.  <br />
B000002H2Z|4.0|1985's \\"The Head on the Door\\" is The Cure's most accessible album. 35 minutes long, oozing with catchy melodies and infectious pop hooks.     The depressed lyrics in songs like \\"In Between Days\\" and \\"Push\\" are overshadowed by the insanely catchy, upbeat synth-pop music.     \\"Close To Me\\" is an absolute pop gem; so simple (bass, hand claps, basic synth melody, and Robert Smith's anguished panting), yet so deliciously infectious.     Also really good is \\"A Night Like This\\", a meeting of the ways between 'goth' and smooth pop - with a saxophone too!     \\"The Baby Screams\\" and \\"Screw\\" are two of the less moments on here; the latter is the most dated thing on here, which almost makes it sort of fun in a 'throwaway' sense.     The album closes with the towering \\"Sinking\\", a 5 minute blast of detached melancholia that foreshadows 1989's ambitious masterpiece \\"Disintegration\\".    Other highlights include the bouncy Beatlesque pop of \\"Six Different Ways\\", the flamenco/latin tinged \\"The Blood\\", and the dark, chilling \\"Kyoto Song\\".     Pop gems galore on this sucker. A great starting point for new fans. Sure, it sounds a little mid-80's dated at times, but you can't deny Robert Smith's songwriting ability.     Best Songs: In Between Days, Kyoto Song, Close To Me, Sinking, The Blood.
0792838068|4.0|I feel compelled to answer the naive misinformation of the acerbic review below by Mr. Chow, whose simplistic dismissal of this movie demonstrates that it is not \\"we\\" who deserve better filmmaking, but Hollywood who deserves a better audience. His demands to have everything laid out for him by an obvious script that stifles the audience's ability to participate in the making of meaning - coming to our own conclusions about the film's probing psychological implications, for instance -- are why movies as genuinely moving as this one become rarer by the year. They are the reason why Hollywood now consistently delivers whole seasons worth of teeny bopper nonsense that makes hundreds of millions of dollars. If the reasons for Ben's self-destruction must be \\"understandable\\" and \\"discernible\\" (how boring), why does it not suffice that Ben was fired, lost his wife and went broke within a short period of time? As he himself says in the movie: \\"did I start drinking because my wife left me, or did my wife leave me because I started drinking?\\" Nonetheless, alcohol addiction is a condition that is almost always the result of a pre-existing depressive temperament for which there is often no \\"discernible\\" explanation. If we lived in a world rife with such easy answers as those demanded by this film's detractors, mental disorders and chemical addictions would be a lot easier to overcome than they are. The presumption is also made that prostitutes only decide to resort to that trade when they \\"hit rock bottom,\\" when in fact many studies confirm that the vast majority of prostitutes suffer from a tremendous and defeating dependency complex in which their frail self-esteem encourages them to pursue abusive relationships that validate their illogical feeling of uselessness. This has nothing to do with external or financial circumstances and everything to do with psychology, an area in which, once again, people thirsting for a one-dimensional human reality will be disappointed. Additionally, I am confounded by the suggestion that Ben and Sera's erudition is at all \\"absurd.\\" Ben -- for those of us who were actually paying attention when watching this movie - reads screenplays for a living. If the possibility that people who read 50 screenplays a week can articulate themselves seems like an absurd one to modern audiences, the problem is with the audience, not the movie. If anything is absurd, it is the assertion that this film is about \\"unconditional love\\" or \\"total commitment.\\" Ben's love is neither selfless nor unconditional, for he never reciprocates even in the mildest way and repeatedly threatens to bolt when Sera's affection threatens his dependence on alcohol. As for Sera, she herself admits that she is \\"just using\\" Ben. Sera, whose behavior throughout the film manifests classic symptoms of the self-loathing and dependent personality that characterizes the vast majority of prostitutes, is more truthful in this statement than in most other things she says throughout the movie. Lastly, the suggestion that this film would have resonated in an entirely different way had the characters been \\"ugly,\\" \\"fat\\" or \\"wrinkled\\" is patently false.  Am I the only one who recalls the great film \\"Iron Weed,\\" in which two filthy, baggy-skinned homeless people with bad teeth cling to one another in a union of unrelenting but feisty devotion? The very virtues Mr. Chow mistakenly ascribes to \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" -- \\"selflessness,\\" redemptive \\"devotion,\\" \\"unconditional love\\" -- all come across powerfully and memorably in that story of an \\"ugly\\" and \\"wrinkled\\" couple.

B000055Y0X|5.0|How good can a black and white film with a mono soundtrack be? The satire was so biting that the release date of December 1963 was changed after President Kennedy's assassination as it was deemed improper to release a film of this sort right after Kennedy's murder.  A Slim Pickens reference to Dallas was overdubbed to make it Las Vegas instead and a scene where President Muffley falls down prompting George C. Scott's line, \\"Our young president has fallen!\\" was edited out entirely.<br /><br />Master director Stanly Kubrick's showcase for the incredibly malleable Peter Sellers is on the \\"AFI Top 100 Films\\" list which in itself makes it a must see.  Sellers work is Oscar worthy as he is completely convincing in three very different roles.  Remarkably Peter Sellers was originally cast to play a fourth role as bomber commander Major T.J. \\"King\\" Kong which ultimately went to Slim Pickens.  Two things prevented Sellers from doing the King Kong role.  First, he had a problem developing the desired Texas accent which he could fix and then he broke his leg which he couldn't fix.  Sellers lost the 1964 Best Actor Oscar to Rex Harrison in \\"My Fair Lady\\" but it is Sellers' performance that has better endured.  So far Sellers is the first and only best actor nominee to have played three different roles in his nominated film. Sellers also played three roles in 1959's \\"The Mouse That Roared\\" but was not nearly as well received.  Arguably \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" is Sellers' best work, although \\"Being There\\" was another shining moment in his career and his \\"Pink Panther\\" films were worldwide blockbusters.<br /><br />George C. Scott said General Buck Turgidson, based on General Curtis LeMay, was his favorite role.  Often overlooked and especially \\"on-target\\" to me was Sterling Hayden's insane conspiracy theorist General Jack D. Ripper characterization.<br /><br />This film is in black and white, which gives it almost a documentary feel.  Those who lived through those turblent days will be reminded of how close we came to doomsday in real life during the spellbinding war-room scenes.  Keep in mind that Sellers' broke his leg after the Burpleson AFB scenes were wrapped and that is why both his war-room characters are always seated.  You'll see James Earl Jones film debut as bombardier Lt. Lothar Zogg.<br /><br />Even a broken leg could not hold Sellers talent down!

0802130208|5.0|I won't bore anyone with yet another glowing review of this amazing book. If you're reading this, no doubt you're already a fan. If you haven't read this book yet, a word of warning - don't read this book in public unless you want the odd stare when you start laughing out loud. One of the few books that you can pick up and start reading  from anywhere and be totally engrossed in the story.
B0001KU93C|4.0|This is a classic spaghetti western and an unforgettable film. Filmed on a low budget in the Spanish winter of 65/66, it shows an inventiveness and exuberance that takes the whole genre forward by the scruff of the neck. Hauntingly atmospheric, brilliantly designed and full of almost non-stop action, it repays endless viewings. A particular bonus with this release is the option of a subtitled Italian-language track, which means (a) that you don't have to listen to the awful English version and (b)you get a taste of the original script, which sometimes differs markedly from the dubbed version. The extras include enlightening interviews with Franco Nero and Ruggero Deodato, and a bonus 10-minute monochrome short (stylised and wordless) featuring Nero as an ageing gunslinger, which is worth a look. The main disappointment is the poor quality of some scenes due to the DVD being sourced from a damaged negative. According to the sleeve, this had been found in an Italian vault, \\"untouched for three decades\\" - but the British Film Institute was able to source a pristine version for the UK cinema and video release in 1991. Apart from that, full marks for presentation. If you want a lesson in how to make an action masterpiece on a shoestring budget then this is the film for you.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|Marillion have been my favorite band for the last 15 years, and this CD is nothing short of stunning. I thought Anoraknophobia was OK, with a bit too much filler and .com and Radiation were both disappointing. But Marbles... <br /> <br />First, spend the extra money and get the 2 CD version. Ocean Cloud is worth the extra money all by itself. You won't regret it. <br /> <br />I won't do a breakdown of each song (you're welcome!), but personal favorites are Invisible Man, Fantastic Place, Ocean Cloud and Neverland. If you've been wondering where Steve Rothery has been, well, he's all over this CD. The guitar in Neverland brings back the goosebumps missing since Brave and AoS.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended. Marillion were slipping in my eyes the last few recordings, but they hit a Home Run with this one. Good job, boys, and thanks for stopping by to see us. Hope to see you Summer 2005.

B00028HBKM|2.0|If this movie was about anything else other than the passion of Christ the very people who support it would be screaming to ban it.  This is an incredibly violent film with needless buckets of blood. Seeing the son of God turned into hamburger did not inspire me or increase or decrease my faith.  Truly awful acting from secondary and tertiary actors and blatant homophobia in the Herod portion of the film add to a nasty mix.  Good acting from primary actors and superior cinematography are the few saving graces. The bold decision to make this multi-lingual and subtitled also deserves to be tried again.  Only for fundamentalist Christians and devout Roman Catholics and not be viewed by anyone under 17.
B00008H2LB|5.0|After 2 and a half years of waiting for a new album they come back.  Not as good as \\"Hybrid Theory\\" but then there may not be an album that is, but it still is a strong album and I'd consider it another classic.  These guys make music better than any group I know, and they have lyrics that change you into whatever mood they want the song to give off.  It has 2 ok songs, 5 classic songs, and the other 4 are great songs.  This cd is a must have for all music fans and I can't wait for their next cd to drop.    #2 - 10 (classic)  #3 - 9.5  #4 - 10 (classic)  #5 - 7.5  #6 - 7  #7 - 10 (classic)  #8 - 10 (classic)  #9 - 10 (classic although it got way overplayed)  #10 - 8  #11 - 8 (great lyrics)  #13 - 9.5
0385508417|4.0|Luther Krank, the modern day Scrooge hero of this story, is my kind of guy!!!  His views on the hassels, commercialism and superficiality of the American Christmas experience match mine in many ways, and his idea to skip the whole thing is an excellent one.  Unfortunately, as Krank discovers, it isn't quite that easy.  Also, in the end, he finds that, despite all the aggravations, there is some merit in the real Christmas spirit.<br /><br />This little book is very entertaining even though a bit exaggerated--particularly at the end.  I am concerned, however, how it will be adapted to the big screen.  It could turn out well, or it could end up being another goofy movie with a crazy, over the top ending.  We will know that shortly.

The presentation as the-misadventures-of-the-comic-heroine was perfected over 20 years ago by Jilly Cooper.  Jane Austen is better.  Jilly Cooper is better.  This would be one of the few cases I have seen where the movie is better than the book.  And that's pretty darn sad.
B000002GZ1|1.0|Yes, this is the great PBBB 1st album (actually, the 2nd, see below), but it's not the CD you should be buying.<br /><br />This domestic CD was released in 1990 and has never been remastered.<br /><br />The import 2CD version of this title (backed with the PBBB's 2nd album \\"East West\\") is the one to get.

There is some fabulous music on that CD, and the liner notes by Paul Rothchild are worth the price alone.
0060930187|2.0|Forgive me, but I just can't understand the popularity of this book. It's supposed to get us inside the mind of a mentally ill young woman, but to me it's merely a two-dimensional relating of events without any true depictions of the raging emotions that must have been going on inside the heroine's mind during them.    I came across Plath's \\"The Bell Jar\\" in a roundabout way. After seeing the rental video version of Elizabeth Wurtzel's \\"Prozac Nation\\", I read the book. Being prone to depression myself, I felt quite a bit of empathy for Wurtzel's stream-of-consciousness relating of her experiences when she was suffering from acute depression and the way her mind was racing at the time.  Yet, when I read other readers' reviews of Wurtzel's book, I was shocked at how many readers felt it was unconvincing and recommended Plath's \\"The Bell Jar\\" or Susanna Kaysen's \\"Girl, Interrupted\\" instead. So, I read those books, too.    Plath's \\"novel\\" is actually a novella-length, autobiographical sketch of Plath's own experiences with depression/schizophrenia as is made clear by both the Introduction and the Biographical Note included. The plot itself is interesting enough (hence, two stars), but that's ALL Plath gives us.  A book like this needs to make us FEEL what Plath is feeling.  And this Plath doesn't do at all    Example:  Plath blandly states that she hasn't been able to sleep at all for three weeks. And just leaves it at that.  Maybe she assumes everyone's had the same experience. But I've BEEN there.  Chronic insomnia cripples and isolates you. If she hadn't slept in three weeks, she would hardly be able to communicate with anyone around her. And believe me, most \\"normal\\" people do NOT know what that is like at all.    Another example: Plath suffers from schizophrenia. Fortunately, I don't; but many years ago I read Joanne Greenberg's \\"I Never Promised You a Rose Garden\\" -- another autobiographical novel by a schizophrenic and, interestingly, written at about the same time Plath was writing this book (the 1960s). Greenberg's depictions of her \\"voices\\" holding counsel inside her mind haunt me to this day.  At one point Plath mentions that her own \\"voices\\" were screaming at her, too. And again just leaves it at that.  What did her voices say to her?  How did they say it?  How did they affect her?  You won't find out by reading this book.    At any rate, for those who are trying to experience what it's really like to look out at the world from a mind suffering from some sort of chronic depression, I still highly recommend Wurtzel's \\"Prozac Nation\\". For those interested in what it's like to be institutionalized, I recommend Kaysen's \\"Girl Interrupted\\", but not as highly.  For those wanting to experience the world of schizophrenia, I strongly recommend Greenberg's \\"I Never Promised You a Rose Garden\\", even though this book is hardly mentioned in other readers' reviews.    As for Plath's \\"The Bell Jar\\" . . .  alas, I can't recommend it for anyone.
1401301010|5.0|This book, the long awaited book by the Red Hot Chili Peppers lead singer Anthony Kiedis, if far from ANY normal rock bands autobiography. It tells you the story of how Anthony was on the verge of death from his drug addiction, but the band and good friend Flea (bass Guitar) helped Anthony recover. The band The Red Hot Chili Peppers are now one of the biggest the world has ever seen-and always will be. Who knows what Anthony Kiedis and the rest of the band have in store for us in the future? In the past, the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik had a song that stood out on it; Under the Bridge. If you listen closely to the lyrics, it's all about Anthony's drug addiction. Other songs like Scar Tissue also explain this. But nothing will explain it more clearly than the book Scar Tissue. This will tell Anthony's life story, and how the band were on the brink of collapse after John was temporarily sacked from the band and the death of band member Hillel Slovak.
B0002IQAMW|5.0|Many thanks are due to whoever is responsible for this fan favorite being mixed to multi-channel SACD.  It sounds great!  Both the multi-channel and stereo mixes represent a significant advance over the way this disc sounded before.  <br />. <br />I guess we should start by thanking Jeff Glixman who most folks know as the producer/engineer for KANSAS. He certainly has endeared himself to this Allman Brothers fan for his excellent work in mixing \\"Eat a Peach\\" to hi-resolution 5.1.  <br />. <br />I compared the new SACD to the most recent edition of the CD - the remastered one released a few years back. I listened to the SACD and the CD simultaneously with the CD in Pro Logic II mode (Denon CD player), while the SACD was played back in a Pioneer universal DVD player. Switching back and forth with volume levels matched, it was easy to hear the improvement.  <br />. <br />The new 5.1 mix has Gregg's voice spread out across all 3 front channels, and the soundstage is much wider than before with the 2 drummers clearly separated between left and right. Soundstage depth is amazing considering that not very much is going on in the surround speakers. Low frequency extension is excellent and fans of Berry Oakley's bass playing will revel in the seismic bottom end. Acoustic guitars sounded like they were being played right there in my living room, while cymbals and other high frequency sounds also sounded like they were being played in my  room.   <br />. <br />This new sense of \\"presence\\" can be thought of another way. During \\"Mountain Jam\\" for example, I felt transported OUT of my living room and right onto the stage with the band. The 3D illusion is so real, it sounded like I was standing between Duane and Dickey's amps, and right in front of and between Jaimoe and Butch's drum kits. The organ and bass sounded like they were coming from everywhere at once, giving me an experiance of immersion in a 3D soundfield.   <br />. <br />Unlike other multi-channel SACD's which throw instruments around the room in jarring and unnatural ways, this SACD uses the surround channels simply for ambient reinforcement of the traditional soundstage which is still up front. The genius of this approach is that it preserves the naturalness of the performance, and the traditional soundstage with Duane on the left, Dickey on the right, Jaimoe on the left, Butch on the right etc., while still creating a 3 dimensional immersive experience.  <br />. <br />Audiophiles who review $100,000 sound systems in magazines like Stereophile often talk about being able to hear the \\"hall\\" that the concert was played in as well as the music. The subtlety of Jeff Glixman's approach to this 5.1 mix enabled me to hear the hall (the Fillmore) on my little $2000 system. Kudos to Jeff Glixman for working that miracle!  <br />.  <br />The improvement over the regular CD can be boiled down to: a much wider and deeper soundfield that expands to fill the entire room. Greater high frequency and low frequency extension. Any element in the mix that you would care to name sounds bigger, clearer and closer. The twin lead guitars of Duane and Dickey sound natural and clear, not shrill or brittle. Fans of Berry Oakley will appreciate that the bass now sounds like a bulldozer going downhill with the throttle wide open. Hold on!  <br />. <br />For those without a multi-channel setup who are interested in the hi-resolution stereo layer, it's wonderful too. Both high and low frequencies are more extended than before, and the soundstage is wider and deeper than the old CD. The drums now sound full-size and close, whereas they used to sound small and somewhat distant. The soundstage is open and transparent with instruments clearly placed in 3D space with plenty of air around each instrument. It really does sound like you're THERE.
B0002JJBZE|4.0|Ok, I just picked up this great box set. It contains all 26 season 2 episodes and some very good bonus features. Season 2 is my personal favorite out of the 3 seasons of TOS. However, I still must complain about the episodes being in date-aired order instead of production order..A big mistake by Paramount..Also the price of this set is way to high..Its only 7 dvds instead of the 8 dvds of season 1, yet its the same price as season 1...that stinks...You can get the complete first season of \\"Lost In Space\\" on 8 DVDs for under $60.00...Trek should be about that price also..Also, another minor complaint is that there is no chapter break after the \\"Final Frontier Intro\\" so here we go having to hit the forward button to get past the intro..    If you have the single dvds that has 2 episodes per dvd, I recommend you keep them and dont buy this set..That set is in production order and u get the chapter break after the intro. Also, the quality is NO DIFFERENT than the ones of the box set.     Here are the episodes included on the set:    \\"AMOK TIME\\"   \\"WHO MOURNS FOR ADONAIS?\\"   \\"THE CHANGELING\\"   \\"MIRROR, MIRROR\\"   \\"THE APPLE\\"   \\"THE DOOMSDAY MACHINE\\"   \\"CATSPAW\\"   \\"I, MUDD\\"   \\"METAMORPHOSIS\\"   \\"JOURNEY TO BABEL\\"   \\"FRIDAY'S CHILD\\"   \\"THE DEADLY YEARS\\"   \\"OBSESSION\\"   \\"WOLF IN THE FOLD\\"   \\"THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES\\"   \\"THE GAMESTERS OF TRISKELION\\"   \\"A PIECE OF THE ACTION\\"   \\"THE IMMUNITY SYNDROME\\"   \\"A PRIVATE LITTLE WAR\\"   \\"RETURN TO TOMORROW\\"   \\"PATTERNS OF FORCE\\"   \\"BY ANY OTHER NAME\\"   \\"THE OMEGA GLORY\\"   \\"THE ULTIMATE COMPUTER\\"   \\"BREAD AND CIRCUSES\\"   \\"ASSIGNMENT: EARTH\\"     I for one am NOT going to pay 99.99 for season 3..I will wait and buy it used for around $50.00...
B000002O1Q|5.0|There is not a bad song on here and the variety makes this a winner.  It's just got a rock 'n roll feel to it, the kind of electricity that rock 'n roll has when you first discover it as a youth.  It is alive, adrenaline pumping and fills you with possibility.   <br /> <br />'I Can Dream About You' became a huge hit and The Fixx was a relative phenomenon in the 80s.  But the best of this soundtrack can only be found by digging in.  'One Bad Stud' and 'Hold That Snake' have a swing to them that you can't help but be smitten by and 'Sorcerer' and 'Never Be You' are so filled with that angst of youth it just oozes through the speakers.  The other songs are also good. <br /> <br />But the two songs that stand out are 'Nowhere Fast' and 'Tonight Is What It Means to Be Young' by Fire, Inc.  The latter has to be one of the best songs ever to pump into your brain all the power and potency of youth, to take you right back to the time when you felt invincible and life was filled with a sense of urgency you almost couldn't contain.  It's a seven minute opus to those feelings.   <br />
0446614459|1.0|The premise of this book was intriguing -- 2 Secret Service agents who \\"lost\\" their presidential candidates under somewhat similar circumstances.  And who isn't interested in the intracies of the Secret Service?   <br /> <br />The problem is that book itself utterly fails to live up to its potential.  I agree wholeheartedly with other reviewers who have noted that second half is pathetic -- I won't dwell on that.  Below are but a few of the other major problems. <br /> <br />The villain.  A stock villain who makes no errors early on and then, once the book needs to end, suddenly turns into the village idiot. <br /> <br />The characters.  Development of the main characters was acceptable if not nearly up to Baldacci's norm.  However, there were too many other characters, most of them dead, to whom we were introduced only as memories.  The assassinated candidates, their managers, their wives, their kids, their friends.  None of them had distinct personalities.  As a result, it was difficult to keep track of which characters were involved in what and even more difficult to care. <br /> <br />The plot.  Unless you're a conspiracy wacko, you'll find it hard to believe that two presidential candidates (albeit third-party candidates) could be killed within a 10-year period and no one in the entire country other the 2 agents finds this worth investigating.   <br /> <br />I won't belabor the point except to say that this could have been an interesting book.  It's not.  If you pick up the book at a flea market and have nothing to do on a cross-country flight, okay.  Otherwise, spend your money on something else.
B00006AW2M|3.0|While many regard this album as a weak one, I agree when it comes to rock 'n' roll standards, but as I happened to listen to this CD on pot and mushrooms, it strikes me as a made-for-drug-use album that doesn't let you down as long as you are high or tripping face.  There's just so much going on in the music it kind of took me away when I closed my eyes. <br />As for the lyrics, it seems to reveal a feeling of isolation and lonliness from the Stones. The women Jagger praises are detailed with peaceful and psychedelic imagery in a world full of confusion and conformity. <br /> <br />Best to Worst: <br />1. She's A Rainbow [A-] <br />Psychedelic pop perfection <br />2. 2000 Man [B+] <br />Not really a radio-ready song, but its lyrics tell a sharp story of futuristic forebooding, in which men have affairs with computers; possible drug message in \\"growing funny flowers\\" may be trying to influence the listener to get high so that they become light-years ahead of their straight and narrow friends. <br />3. Lantern [B] <br />Nicely constructed. The lyrics evoke Middle Age castles and the troubled romance of two lovers among them, with nice music that interludes the verses. <br />4. Citadel [B] <br />Crashing music leads into chaotic verses warning of the crazy world the lyrics describe, and Mick Jagger calls the women of his fancy to escape to his lair of santuary. A loud pleasing rocker that is the psychedlic sister of \\"Get Off Of My Cloud\\". <br />5. Sing This All Together [B] <br />The upbeat intro with a powerful driving beat. The lyrics are simple but the music takes you places and evokes African tribal dances. The song seems to be simple on purpose, with going back to your roots as a theme, stressing unity as its goal. This is one for the hippies. <br />6. Gomper [B] <br />Heavily instrumental, this song is almost dream-like psychedlia, yet the singing is a tad annoying. The bland lyrics don't help, but the band saves the song with its music, as if they know it is itsstrength. The song described in one word: pretty. <br />7. 2000 Light Years From Home [B-] <br />The song almost takes you from planet to planet and across the galaxy with its structure. The music is rockin', but the song comes off as silly. Its too surrealistic sci-fi lyrics bring it down and the fact it seems unfinished is the weight that keeps it that way. The song is not that fun to listen to, its like a head trip, yet the fact it conjures a feeling of eeriness makes it worth a spin. <br />8. Sing This All Together (see what happens) [B-] <br />The longer, wilder version of track 1 that is not as good because it is simply TOO long. An experimental track that would be perfect for smoke session, but not for a listen. <br />9. In Another Land [C+] <br />It's annoying. <br />10. On With The Show <br />Not really a song, but an outro. If it was a song, it would seem too out of place. Jagger seems drunk. <br />CD Grade: B
1594200106|1.0|I find this book very difficult to bear, since the characters are so flat, the plot so complicated, and so long in extension. I prefer authors that say more with less words. If there were more substance here, maybe I'd do a great effort to criticize more sympathetically.
0385471378|5.0|the first time I saw one of Laura's books we were in Phoenix <BR>exhibiting my husbands sculpture show. The weather was hot the sun almost always lite the intense blue sky. Bruce first read the book and highly recommended it to me because of the similarities of ethnic origins.<BR> To read Like Water for Chocolate is like taking a emotional course on life. Laura's story telling made it's way through my eyes and landed in my heart. Her descriptions of her emotions and the linking to food and it's preparation was superb. You will find that you prepare and enloy food in a way you never did before. If you want to be in someone else's shoes and heart for the length of this book then I highly recommend it. I savored every page of the last chapter, knowing that the end <BR>was near, I could not bear to finish it. I have tried to explain my feeling through my sculpture, I can only hope that I can<BR>achieve  as well as Laura Esquirel does. <BR>I always have one of her books on the go. Instead of reading from start to finish I now read a chapter here and there as an emothional treat. It's not where you end up, it's how you get there. thankyou Laura Esquirel for that.
0312319517|2.0|A villain who has disappeared from public view and now stays hidden in a fortress guarded by piranha filled canals, shark infested seas, man-eating dogs and machine-gun toting guards.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately this isn't a James Bond novel, it's actually written by Frederick Forsyth. How the author of \\"Day of the Jackal\\" and \\"The Odessa File\\" could perpetrate this piece of pulp is beyond me. Suffice to say Frederick Forsyth trying to write like Ian Fleming or Robert Ludlum is not worth it. Definitely to be avoided if you are a Frederick Forsyth fan and even more so if you haven't read any of his novels before.
0060977493|5.0|The framework is typical modernism: fragmented language and flashbacks. The characters come across in small episodes and Roy leaves as much to infer as she delivers narratively. It's depressing, too. But as soon as the stage is set - a low-rafters psychology which drives the characters' problems - the characters learn mental and emotional ways around them, which are joyful and buoyant.    Be ready to work through this book, because the characters do, therefore you do too. But she ignores the construct of omniscience in favor of more overtly literary constructs, and to me it comes across in a cool way.    The God of Small Things is a pun- the kids are the small things, and the daily lives they enjoy are the counterbalance to the most overt opression and depression imaginable. This is what the main characters are trying to recapture and it is pretty much the Serenity Prayer.
B000002JPA|1.0|This is thrash metal garbage not prog rock. Terrible lyrics! These guys are like Styx and Metallica  banding together and making music, but not being able to make up their minds what to write about. So they just play long songs with improvised lyrics. Not good at all. If you want good prog listen to Pink Floyd, Yes, Genesis or Marillion.<br />Do not buy Dream Theatre! Buy condoms instead!
B00005JN4O|5.0|By pure chance, I happened to catch 'Finding Neverland' sneak peek.  I highly recommend it.  It is such a 'pretty' movie.  The Neverland sets for J.M. Barrie's play are enchanting and completly catch you up in the magic of it all.  The acting is wonderful, a definate audience connection.  Johnny Depp is brillent and Kate Winslet adds such a soft strength.  The children were perfect and the whole film thourughly inspirational.
B000002JPA|1.0|I read that this was a modern prog band.WRONG!!!!!!!This is a Styx crossed with Metallica contraption. Terrible lyrics. Probably the worse album I have ever heard.<BR>Don't buy this. Save your money. Buy condoms instead.

068987474X|5.0|Get the book ladies - it saves you the heartache in the end.  My friends and I have been passing around a copy of this one since it came out.  The book is going to take the dating world by storm - at least for those who read it.  In response to some of the negative \\"self-help\\" digs about why we need/don't need a book to spell it out - it isn't that we HAVE to have it but it sure does put the truth in print and that reality is why so many of us have clouded judgement and well-meaning friends who allow us to keep repeating the pattern.  I look at it this way - if it makes even one woman realize that the dead-end relationship she is carrying on is never going to work because he just isn't into her then great! After all isn't it better to not \\"waste the pretty\\" on some idiot and get out there and have that guy who IS INTO YOU and then some get the chance you both are waiting for.  So \\"Congrats\\" to those of you who find the book unnecessary - glad you figured it out on your own, now leave the rest of us alone so we can enjoy this fabulous moment of realization.  Thanks Greg & Liz for the book that IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE!
B00005R2M3|5.0|Firstly..as indicated in the other reviews..I highly disagree with what most of you have said about Shakira's appearance. One: she dyed her hair to carry a Marilyn Monroe essence. Not for the publicity. If you have seen her in other times during her career, she changes her look often and not for the reasons that many have stated.<br /><br />Two: The video for Wherever, Whenever was almost completely in Shakira's hands. If anyone knew her, they'd know she was a perfectionist and if she didn't want to do \\"all of those skimpy things\\" she wouldn't have. She's very much in control and I am almost purely confident that the video turned out , for the most part, the way she wanted it to. How ridiculous can one be not to notice how sensual and even sexual this woman is, and then verbally criticize her for it's obvious presence in a video?! She doesn't move or dance the way she does for attention (she had it at Hello) or to sell records. This is just an example of how superficial and shallow American audiences can be. Smarten up kids.<br /><br />SO: Please do not even begin to compare her to Jessica Simpson, Britney Spears, or any other American bubble gum singer. Shakira is Shakira...Take it all or shut it.<br /><br />Now, the album. What can one say about Laundry Service that hasn't already been said? Basically, it is Shakira in her attempt to write songs in an entirely different language than her own. But, not surprisingly, she writes some pretty amazing lyrics that carry on the poetic flow of her previous albums. Which is the most I can say for many of our own artists in which English is their first and only language.<br /><br />The music also carries on the same mesh of rock, arabic rythyms, pop, and ballads. The new turn this album takes is the change from acoustic roots to electric, with the exception of \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\" and \\"The One\\". My personal favorites are \\"Te Dejo Madrid\\", \\"Poem to a Horse\\", and \\"Objection\\" the spanish version. The video for \\"Te Dejo Madrid\\" is quite enjoyable as well.<br /><br />All in all, this album may not be one of Shakira's best, but an incredible milestone and an important one as well. Shakira manages to put many American pop/rock artists and even latin  artists to shame. \\"Laundry Service\\" is an excellent album written by an amazingly indescribable woman. A great listen for anyone and everyone.<br /><br />And for all of you Shakira fans, you won't be disappointed...are we ever?Madrid\\" is quite enjoyable as well. <br /> <br />All in all, this album may not be one of Shakira's best, but an incredible milestone and an important one as well.

0385512104|3.0|If I were reviewing this as an adult's book then I would award it 5 stars without any hesitation. Any book that holds my attention to such a degree that I read it in one sitting certainly deserves that, despite the fact that towards the end I started to lose sympathy for the narrator. <br /> <br />However, many people mistakenly feel this is a chidren's book. Although the text is clear and simple, this is NOT in my opinion a book  suitable for a child; young adults yes, but not children. The bad language and profanities throughout the text make it unsuitable. I lost count of the amount of times I read the 'F' word and worse (often several times per page). The reason is that the narrator's mental problem means he remembers everything he sees/hears in detail and repeats it verbatim. Doubtless, kids hear language as bad, and worse, every day at school, but that doesn't automatically mean that responsible parents want them reading it at home.  <br /> <br />Don't let the bright childlike cover-art, or the fact it is frequently seen displayed beside Rowling and Snicket, fool you into thinking it is suitable for ages 12 and under. If you are the broad-minded parent of a precocious child, then go ahead; however, discerning parents may wish to check this book out BEFORE ordering a copy for a child. I feel it only fair to make this clear. After all, television programmes that use bad language before 9 pm are obliged to broadcast a warning beforehand.  <br /> <br />This is already a best-selling adult book. Children aren't children for long, they can always read it in a year or two.  <br /> <br />I know many will not agree with my opinion, thinking my view is outdated or narrowminded. Most people who take this stance are not parents themselves - perhaps they'll see things differently as and when they are! My intention is to provide parents with the facts ... it is up to each individual to judge whether this is something they want for their children or not. <br />
078681859X|4.0|This is a very strong book. However, some of its strengths are also, perhaps, its weaknesses.  <br /> <br />The story is told from two very different viewpoints: Nathaniel the apprentice and Bartimaeus a 5,000 year-old djinn (a good scrabble word). Bartimaeus is a witty raconteur, and tells his first-person story in a style reminiscent of P G Wodehouse, complete with hilarious footnotes. (In fact, the two main characters often reminded me of Jeeves and Wooster - a know-it-all servant frequently rescuing his hapless young master). Unfortunately, the djinn's sense of humour makes Nathaniel's chapters (told simply from a narrator's viewpoint) seem to drag a little in comparison.  <br /> <br />Furthermore, Nathaniel isn't always the most likeable of heroes - though his human flaws are sometimes a refreshing change from some young wizards. However, the two main characters' uneasy relationship is what makes the book really work - especially as Bartaemus is no stereotypical sidekick; it is impossible to be certain precisely where his loyalties lie (apart from with his wickedly self-obsessed self). <br /> <br />The writing is a sheer delight. However, I began to wonder whether this was what kept me turning the pages, rather than the plot. The plot itself worked well, but at times suffered slightly from a rather too feeble villain. Simon Lovelace (even his name is feeble) is certainly no Voldemort. I await the second part of this trilogy with anticipation. With a really dastardly villain and a few more twists to the plot, Mr Potter could find himself with some serious competition! <br />
0783225849|5.0|This is one,if not the best,of Hitchcocks best works. To this day it is still better than any big budget piece of crap horror movies. On a side not to the reviewer who gave this movie one star, the guys name was Ed Gien not Ed Gaines. If your going to bad mouth a movie get your facts right, retard. Also it inspired Silence of The Lambs NOT Red Dragon.
B00005JMUA|5.0|One of the first things that struck me about Kill Bill 2 is how Tarantino seems to have aimed it at a subtly different audience. The first was both a paean and a parody of the Hong Kong style fight film and the anime style that is part and part of the same package. This film is something else - in some ways it is almost a commentary on the forces behind the making of part one, and an opportunity for Tarantino, speaking through Bill (David Carradine), to express some of his aesthetics directly to a willing audience.<br /><br />This makes it a somewhat headier film as it traces The Bride's (Uma Thurman) progress towards their inevitable confrontation. The first part of the film, told in the context of a live burial covers confrontations with both Bill's brother Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle (Darryl Hannah). The best acting here is a surprise performance by Chia Hui Liu, who plays Pai Mei, a perfect parody of a Chinese master of the martial arts. In many ways, these sequences are some of the best in the film, and they crystallize what is happening to The Bride (also known as Beatrix Kiddo) in the present.<br /><br />That part done, the action turns to the hunt for Bill and Bea's discovery of her child (mentioned at the end of Kill Bill 1). This is the point where Tarantino shifts gears, spending as more time on emotional and intellectual questions than he does on actual violence. This makes an interesting contrast, and those who were expecting an explosive conclusion may find that this time they are a bit nonplussed. There is a moment of blurring action, but this adheres more to the Samurai model where the actual stroke occurs in a moment, almost as a side effect of the dramatic content.<br /><br />What makes this all exceptional is that Tarantino to what was an absolutely predictable plot and manages to make each movement full of surprise and seeming free will. Tarantino shows himself a master of camera styles and choreography to the same effect, focusing this time on more intimate spaces. The physical acting is also notable (especially the fight scene between Elle and The Bride). The two films in this series make an interesting study of the palette of one of our more unorthodox directors.s time on more intimate spaces.
