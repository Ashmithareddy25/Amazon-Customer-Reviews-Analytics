B004DLPXAO|5.0|The Kindle for Android app is what has allowed me to overcome my lack of interest in reading non-physical books. I never found reading on a device to be acceptable until the Kindle app. Quite frankly, it is simple to use and makes it easy to keep your place at all times. I doubt I will return to physical books except for certain, specific titles.
0399157565|5.0|Patricia Cornwell is an amazing writer.  I have read all her books and she does not let you down with Bone Bed.  Her books due cause lack of sleep, as I couldn't put it down, just continued to turn pages.
B001G70M6S|5.0|At 30 years old, most of the people around my age can at least remember seeing a Polaroid camera as a kid, so everytime I break out my Land Camera models, art directors, family and friends all go ape shump over it. This works perfectly, fits perfectly, and brings a smile to everyone's face. Sellers will vary so I can't guarantee that your order will be good, but I've had 100% luck with the black and white so far. The only tough thing is getting a proper exposure outside since it's 3000 speed film, but there's certainly ways around that, and it's incredible in doors.
1400069289|5.0|By looking at the overwhelming 5 stars on this book, it makes sense to anyone to have a look into this book. Our brain are lazy and want to do things without thinking. So our brains put out a three point system. Cue, routine and reward. This books goes into detail about each ones and goes into real world situations in later chapters like, How does Tony Dungy turns a football programs like the colts into a world champion, how does starbucks allow emploies to work to their highest potential, how does target almost double their business in a couple of short years, and what I found very interesting, how does radio stations turn Hey Yeah, a song  that everyone hated, into one of the most popular songs in the 2000s. The list keeps going on and on but it goes back to the three point system, Cue, Routine, and Reward.<br /><br />Once you have that mastered, you can loose weight, become more productive, or even lead a group of people. This book can be useful for anyone in any part of their life!
B008DM4OTA|5.0|a great game for my 5 year old and my 3 year old. They both love it. It works great on my phone as well as my tablet. we  had the free version for a while and we are excited to have the full version now!

B0095XPZBC|5.0|I've read a few reviews on here regarding the disappointment of some fans regarding the visual quality of Season Two in comparison to Season One; to be honest I do not see much a difference.  The quality is so high that I'm actually enjoying watching Season Two for the first time.  It's always been my least-favorite season.  I'm not suggesting the other reviewers are wrong in their assessment that the video quality from Season One to Season Two is starkly different, I'm merely suggesting not everyone will notice.  It still looks amazing.  And, it's twenty-five years old.  It's not going to have the same quality as a film made this year released to Blu Ray.<br /><br />On to the product itself... I could not be happier.  I watched the 25th Anniversary Reunion first, called Reunification (fitting!).  It was interesting to watch the entire main cast (minus Denise Crosby) interact with one another in a casual setting.  The fifth disc also includes two additional high-def special features that make up \\"Make It So, Continuing Star Trek: The Next Generation.\\"  It's essentially a continuation of the mini-docs on the Season One set.  There's plenty of stock footage of old interviews, newer interviews from recent years, and even brand new interview footage of Diana Muldaur, which was was a real treat.  Gates McFadden talks candidly about why she was fired and why she came back.  John deLancie is interviewed.<br /><br />I have not watched extended version of \\"The Measure of a Man\\" yet, but I can't wait.  The fact that we got an extended episode - fifteen or so entire extra minutes - added back into the episode in full HD where it was originally shot is amazing.  My only hope is there'll be more extended episodes on future sets.  I would love to see an extended \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" or \\"The Offspring\\" or \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\" on Season Three.  As with the first season set, the second set includes all the original episodic promos plus the original DVD extras.<br /><br />Asfor the quality of the second season, my opinion of it has elevated over the years.  At first I was turned off because I did not like the character of Dr. Pulaski.  Diana Muldaur is a great actress, loved her on L.A. Law but I didn't feel she gelled well in the TNG cast.  I do feel if she had stuck around for the third season this would have improved, however I was happy that Gates returned to the series.  Dr. Crusher fit better.  We also get the addition of Ten Forward and Guinan, played by Whoopi Goldberg of course.  The quality of the writing clearly improved during Season Two.  Yes there are some downright silly episodes and special effects, but overall the episodes are good.  \\"The Measure of a Man\\" is of course, astounding.  Also good are \\"Pen Pals,\\" \\"Elementary, Dear Data,\\" \\"The Emissary,\\" \\"Q Who?\\" \\"Peak Performance.\\"  I was very disappointed in \\"Shades of Grey\\" as a season-closer.  I suspect this was due to the writers's strike and the fact that the season missed four episodes.<br /><br />I do hope since the even-numbered seasons are being farmed out that we get future releases more quickly.  I did read on TrekCore.com that a first quarter 2013 release is likely.
0091939526|5.0|Timothy Ferriss is a brilliant author- he tells it like it is and cuts through the fluff. Practical and doable!<br />Don't be intimidated by the thickness of this book it is an easy read with a dozen plus chapters.

B008WCP2PG|2.0|Tatum Channing did an awesome dancing but I found the movie vulgar. I was expecting something totally different. Probably will appeal to some people.
B000F6IOBQ|5.0|Kate Beckinsale does an AMAZING job in this role. I absolutely love her and the concept of this movie! It was really well written with developing the plot and making us feel like Selene.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Great movie,spinoff of the old 21 Jump Street with Johnny depp. Very funny, with a very surprising ending, The actor's were great.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I love Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw. The plot behind this movie was heart warming. It was nice to see someone with so little end up with so much from all he touched. Really have a lot of respect for Michael and the acting was incredible!
B003UMW68Y|5.0|What can I say about this movie? Well it's a Tim Burton movie,meaning it's great. I'm not crazy about animation but Tim Burtons is the greatest.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|That's Why God Made The Radio exceeded my expectations, in many ways. First, the individual songs and production are jewels, the harmonies are exactly what you'd expect from the Beach Boys...30 years ago. But now? 50 years on, their voices blend as well as ever (augmented by the talented Jeff Foskett) and the arrangements are exquisite. It is hard to believe that these are the voices of guys who are around 70 years old!<br /><br />But it's also the flow of songs, starting with a joyful, if somewhat whistful trio of pop ditties, staring with the title song, the jaunty \\"Isn't It Time\\" and \\"Spring Vacation,\\" punctuated by the wonderfully sardonic \\"Private Life of Bill and Sue\\" (a theme song for anyone who abhors the reality-TV trend that is so popular these days), followed by another triplet of catchy, later-day Beach Boys tunes--\\"Shelter,\\" \\"Daybreak Over the Ocean\\" (Mike Love wrote a winner here) and \\"Beaches in Mind.\\" All are filtered through time, reflecting happy memories, and are joyful, in a quieter way that befits maturity.<br /><br />And then we reach the final four emotionally charged songs, in which Brian Wilson and company masterfully come face to face with their own mortality. This goes beyond the angst-filled lyrics of Wilson's 1970s tune \\"Until I Die\\". These new songs are written from the perspective of someone who has seen, and experienced, much in life, and is coming to terms with their later years.<br /><br />In \\"Strange World\\" Brian Wilson looks around his world--as represented by the Santa Monica Pier--sees all the excesses of youth (which he's no stranger to) and admits it's kinda wierd. But as he says, \\"I'm getting through it.\\" For anyone who knows about Brian's strange journey, that's a declaration of victory for him. And yet, there's a sense of premonition in this song.<br /><br />\\"From There and Back Again\\" lyrically addresses the physical limits of aging. \\"Why don't we feel the way we used to any more...maybe we could stay and listen to the waves at my front door.\\" When I heard these words, I thought: how far the Beach Boys have traveled from \\"Fun, Fun, Fun\\" and \\"Catch A Wave,\\" but that's the point. This song is about acceptance of the changes life brings you--Al sings lead, by the way, and ironically, sounds as youthful as ever.<br /><br />Pacific Coast Highway is a short song that turns emotionally darker as the realization sinks in that time is running short. \\"Sunlight's fading away and there's not much left to say.\\" If you are prone to tears, this is where the Kleenex box should be kept close at hand as the Beach Boys lyrically drive off into the sunset, and sing, \\"goodbye.\\"<br /><br />But Brian, Mike, Al, Bruce and David aren't done.<br /><br />\\"Summer's Gone\\" is an emotionally devastating musical farewell, where we are taken to the end of the line. \\"I'm gonna sit and watch the waves. We laugh, we cry. We live then die and dream about our yesterday\\" sings Brian, followed by a long fade out to gentle waves in a moment of symbolism that nobody could possibly miss. For anyone dealing with aging, who has lived through a close friend or relative's death, or is dealing with their own mortality and the slow decline, this song will resonate. For those too young to understand...give this song a listen in a decade or two.<br /><br />There has been chatter that the Beach Boys, bouyed by the success of this album, the tour and the fact that they still sound so good, are talking about doing more projects together, perhaps another album or more. That would be great. But if this is it, they've gone out on a very high note indeed. If you are no longer in the habit of buying CDs thanks to how the music biz has changed, I recommend making an exception here. While the individual songs are stellar, this is a theme album and the whole is much greater and more emotionally powerful than the sum of its parts.
B000FC10MU|4.0|I read this book on the recommendations of several coworkers. I thought it was well executed. The wordsmith was excellent.<br />I would recommend this book to others that are interested in mythology.
B008NA3I30|4.0|I swear those Canadians can churn these kinds of movies out endlessly; and I can't say I'm sorry. I enjoyed watching this movie very, very much.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Margot (Michelle Williams) can probably write but uses her talent to write p.r. type stuff. She's married to Lou (Seth Rogen) who writes cookbooks featuring chicken and chicken only. They live in Ontario and are good together. They have a cool, interesting thing between them, but she has some issues, some voids that eat at her. She meets Daniel (Luke Kirby) on a flight. He paints, but is afraid to display his works. Turns out he lives across the street from her and therein lies the rub as the two become interested in one another.<br /><br />The user reviews on this are lukewarm, but for me it was a great watch. First off, I like the set up. Of the three main characters, there are really no \\"bad\\" people. Rogen seems perfectly content though there may be something in the fact he doesn't want children. From the opening shot, when you see Margot out of focus, you know she will be the crux of the matter. She is generally happy but something is missing. The finger is pointed at her more than Rogen as being a villain. Daniel is a decent guy but has issues in fear and sees something in Margot. Though he respects the fact she's married, he still needs to be with her. They don't \\"cross the line\\" but they still do damage to the status quo.<br /><br />Hat's off to the set directors here. Both Morgot's/Lou's place and Daniels place are cluttered, but it's a great clutter; filled with all sorts of odd stuff all over the place. The eye is constantly wandering over things, and the color scheme is great. Colors and things that normally would not occupy the same frame in most movies are at home here. Whoda thunk that Sarah Polley would go from child actor to such an astute writer/director. This is a woman's film to be sure (note the post aerobics shower scene) and she fills the circumstances with subtle nuance. For me there was only one clunky scene in the whole film. And she interjects certain plot points in surprising ways. Oh! The sound track is really nifty too. I liked the tunes a lot and I liked the way they underscored the content.<br /><br />I must stop now or the length will put people off from reading it but I like this film a lot and would recommend it unhesitatingly to anyone fond of indy films.
1250006341|5.0|Beautiful book!  Photographs and information very enjoyable!  This made a perfect gift, would definitely recommend to all Downton Abbey fans.
B007SRWER0|1.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend.  While I realize the author is intelligent and knowledgable, I couldn't get too far into the book without simply setting it aside.  I had the impression that the author simple cobbled together various notes and, more likely, tape recordings of his lectures, and formatted them as best he (or, again, likely someone else) could and made it into a book.<br /><br />There is no doubt some great information inside the book, but I didn't feel like it was presented in a cohesive way, and I simply set it aside and threw in the towel.

0307887448|4.0|Ready Player One is a fun, light, immensely readable paean to 80s pop culture, MMORPGs (massive multiplayer online role playing games) like Worlds of Warcraft and Everquest, and classic arcade and pre-arcade video games.  The author has a very comfortable prose style, and I tore through the book in just a couple days.  Being a 40something ex gamer (countless quarters into Defender, Robotron and dozens of other Williams and other arcade games, plus half a decade lost to that bottomless pit known as Everquest), the book was a sea of happy memories of my younger days, and without reading any of the author's bio, I suspect his history mirrors mine.  I can't say how someone not exposed to the Pac Man and 80s sitcom subculture would enjoy that torrent of references and plot devices, but I certainly did, and recommend this book to anyone who knows what it means when you put a quarter on the plexiglass of an arcade game.<br /><br />**** Mild Spoilers ****<br /><br />My quibble, and the reason I didn't give it a 5 star review, is that the book does feel like a young adult novel.  The peril and loss, while important to the story, never feels particularly strong or harrowing.  The plot advances with a relentless inevitability, and even without pondering the implication of the first-person-recollection structure of the prose, there was always a clear sense that the protagonist would win out.  The dystopian near future portrayed - we've run out of oil and other energy sources, all but the wealthiest, even in the first world, live in ramshackle conditions, everyone has retreated into the virtual reality world, corporations have run amok, doesn't jibe with the book's publication date, when it was already known that the US and Canada are sitting on massive gas and oil reserves.  The book doesn't have the texture of those written by other futurists and cyberpunk authors.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but if you're looking for the next Neal Stephenson opus, this isn't it.  But, to reiterate, it was great fun and highly readable.
B002PNER9U|5.0|Our whole family enjoyed this very much. Music is delightful and the story was beautifully told - I recommend this!
B004LWZWGK|3.0|The movie itself is great, as other reviews have described. My review will focus more on my personal experience with the Bluray format.<br /><br />I tested the Bluray version of this movie on a friend's hardware player and on my own two computers.<br /><br />Both Bluray discs in this package worked fine on my friend's hardware player, which confirms the discs aren't technically defective in any way.<br /><br />Neither of my computers would play either of the two Bluray discs in the package, however. Both computers (Windows 7) will play other Bluray discs. The most recent Bluray I had on hand (aside from TDKR) was a 2010 release of _Tombstone_.<br /><br />The software in both computers...Cyberlink PowerDVD 8 on one and Corel WinDVD BD on the other...is the most recent version available. Updating to the current versions of those players would run $50 to $70.<br /><br />I am returning this set for a refund. I don't think it's asking too much to expect compatibility with equipment that was brand new only two years ago.<br /><br />I do realize that my complaint applies to the current state of Bluray in general more than to these specific discs.<br /><br />Of course, your mileage may vary, depending on equipment and software version.

B007FEZQF8|5.0|Through 3 and a half seasons on TV this book couldn't fill my fix any better. They are different but not a bad different. Great book series.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interesting book which kept me engaged but there were some holes in the storyline which were disconcerting, so I kept my rating at 4 stars instead of 5. Frankly, the ending left me disguested at the main character, so perhaps it's a good read after all, as I was emotionally involved in the story. A quick read with interesting twists.
B009AP2G26|3.0|I love the music from this TV series. The only thing that hits it hard for me is that it is very controversial. It hits every controversial subject out there, and it feels like this year there is too much to take in at one time. They have the graduates come back as well as having all new people. The controversial issues in this series combined with the same ones as last year might be too much. What this series needs is closure so the watchers can move on. In this series so far they are becoming a little overwhelming with the issues and drama it sparks.

0446580848|5.0|The name of the book is \\"The Panther\\" and the author is Nelson DeMille. I hereby declare this book to be my favorite read in 2012. I have long been a big fan of Nelson DeMille and have read almost all of his novels. He is a masterful author and one that writing students should study to really learn the art of fiction writing. In  \\"The Panther\\", we once again see the world through the eyes of NYPD homicide detective, John Corey. Along the way, another of DeMille's protagonists joins the special team, namely Paul Brenner. Corey was introduced in \\"Plum Island\\" and in total, has been the hero of six novels. Two of those novels deal with a Libyan terrorist called the Lion. These particular adventures are background to why John Corey was assigned to tracking down the Panther in Yemen. Paul Brenner was introduced in the book, \\"The General's Daughter\\", which was made into a major motion picture starring John Travolta. Paul Brenner reappears in the book, \\"Upcountry\\" which involves his adventures in postwar Vietnam.<br /><br />John Corey and his wife Kate, are assigned to an anti-terrorism network in New York City. Now they are strongly encouraged to accept an assignment in Yemen that John Corey recognizes as very dangerous. However Kate is anxious to do something new and wants to accept the assignment. Once in Yemen, John and Kate meet their other team members. Paul Brenner with a background in military intelligence is one of the team members. Paul seems to take the shine to Kate which provokes mental wisecracks from the mind of John Corey. Another team member called Buck is a vehicle for the author to present information about Yemen, most of which is not conducive to making you wish to visit. At times, DeMille gives us a birds eye view of what the Panther is up to. The Panther is a transplanted American of Yemenis descent. He is extremely power-hungry and abnormally bloodthirsty. Add to the mix, one devious CIA agent named Chet Morgan, who heads the team and the plot gets ever more complex.<br /><br />This is not a short novel. It is 630 pages and about 500 of them are devoted to developing a background for the reader. However once the action begins, you will not be able to turn the pages fast enough. If you have not read Nelson DeMille before, prepare yourself for a most delightful experience. He has a way of writing that is enjoyable even when nothing exciting is happening at the time in the plot. I give this book my highest recommendation.<br /><br />Ralph D Hermansen, December 6, 2012ver more complex.<br /><br />This is not a short novel.

B0023SDPS6|5.0|Craig Johnson's a terrific writer and his Longmire series is brutally honest, imaginative, and sometimes too gritty for a wimp like me, but I just could not put them down.  I had to re-read some of them to get them in the right order.<br /><br />In this Longmire book, revenge and the toll it takes on everyone associated with it, is the focal point of the book.  Like Hurricane Sandy it's unstoppable and indiscriminately destroys everyone in its path.  Craig Johnson's books are realistic portrayals of the human psyche.  Definitely not a cosy.
0316228532|1.0|I am a prolific reader and could count on one hand the number of times I have given up on a book.  After  2 attempts I gave up on this one. I found it dull and boring. Admittedly when I read what it was about I would not have normally picked it up anyway, but as it was \\"J K Rowling\\" I thought it would be worthwhile. I am only grateful that I borrowed this from the library and did not purchase it.
B00A83075M|5.0|Wreak It Ralph is the next \\"Toy Story.\\" It has diverse and delightful characters as it combines elements of \\"Tron,\\" \\"Starship Troopers,\\" and \\"Candyland.\\" Ralph is a \\"bad guy\\" in a game. He wants to be a good guy and get a medal so he crosses over to another game and ends up in a third game where he meets the Vanellope whose voice is excellently portrayed by Sarah Silverman who made the film.<br /><br />The film has themes of being yourself, self sacrifice, and bullying. The language is sometimes saucy such as \\"gutter snipe\\" and \\"pussy willow.\\" As an adult, I enjoyed this feature. It is one you can enjoy with your kids.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|This is far from his best work.  Full of wisecracks, as usual, but weak of plot.  Probably is worst effort professionally.
B00003A9QL|5.0|Finding a non-explicit version of this album is surprisingly difficult, possibly because there isn't really much explicit content in the album to being with - just a few curse words here and there (not uncommon for a concert I suppose).  There are indeed clean and explicit versions of this album though and the first time I bought this album years ago it had no sticker on it - so I assumed there were no expletives.  Recently though, \\"Master of Puppets\\" popped up in my iTunes queue and I noticed it contained some cursing.  I can't speak for the rest of the album, but I wanted to fix this with a REAL clean version of the album.<br /><br />Comparing the two albums James Hetfield still shots out \\"H#@% yeah!\\" at one point in \\"Master of Puppets,\\" but the other expletive that I could easily find in my old version had been replaced by a sample from earlier in the track.  Sadly, because the edit overrides the prior segment with a sample from a less exciting part of the track, the edited segment eliminates some of the original flare, but I'll take that over the gratuitous cursing.<br /><br />I got my copy from newtownvideos - hopefully my shipment wasn't a fluke and they really do always label their CDs properly so you too can get the clean version if you want it.
B002RKSZKI|5.0|I downloaded Emma for free on my kindle from amazon. This book is about Emma a vain wealthy and confident young woman who lives in a small town in Highbury, England. She cares for her father who is worried that she is not going to get married.  She plays  match maker  for her friends and acquaintances by setting them up with different suitors. Emma realize that her matchmaking skills was not good and cause a lot of grief. So she vowed never to get marry, but ended getting married to a very unexpected person .<br /><br />This book is a typical romance comedy friction novel. It started of slow and then the pace pick  back up again. You will see Emma finding herself  and becoming a better  person. I think the Emma character means well and wants her friends to be in high society like her, but she comes of snobby and meddlely. while reading the book I keep saying to myself girl just fall back and fix your own self up. If you love Jane Austen then you will love this book, becuase she love to write drawn out romance novels.<br /><br />I think this book will be perfect for a lazy sunday afternoon or a long plane ride.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I just downloaded this game to my Kindle FIRE.  So far I really enjoy playing the game.  It's pretty addictive.  I went though about 40-50 short sets in a matter of 30 minutes.  At one point I could not believe how quickly I was able to figure out how to unlock the puzzle and then in some sets I was stumped.  It's not too complicated to learn but builds upon itself as you complete each set.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves puzzle games.
B007SGM084|1.0|Predictable and UNREALISTIC are the best descriptions I can give this trilogy.  The first book was fun and got me excited (ignore the pun here please). But about 1/4 way through book 2 I was bored.  I flipped throught sex scenes and  was so bored I fell asleep.  The books would have been so much better if the author would have stuck with the kinky sex AND if he wouldn't have tried to introduce Ever Possible Plot ever written - theft, kidnapping, rich, sexy, attempted murder, car chase - You name it, it was in this series.<br />I say save your money.  Read book one, then guess what happens . . .....chances are you'll be right.<br />(happily ever after anyone?)
B0000CCZ34|5.0|I would recommend this to everyone!<br />All the top hits all pulled together.<br />If you get the specail box set which you really should it comes with a third disc 10 great full length remixes.  There are 35 tracks on the 2 disc package and a total of 45 tracks on the 3 disc box set.<br />If your a PSB's fan this is for you! If your just getting to know The PSB's than grab this up, its all the songs you'll grow to love.

6305212112|5.0|Excellent Film! One of the very best of its time staring the award winning Jessica Tandy and Kathy Bates.  Watch as an unhappy house wife played by Bates befriends Tandy in a nursing home. Tandy tells her of a tell of laughter, devotion and a frienship that defies all obstacles.  Bates becomes addicted to the story and returns time after time to find out what happens. As the story is told it helps bates to become a stronger woman and to stand up for herself.<br /> Tandy spins the tale well and draws you in to al the lies, the murder and cover up at the Whistle Stop.<br />  This is a movie you will watch again and again.<br />The acting id superb! Plot is Excellent!  a 10+ !

B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie came from true events.<br />It's great from beginning to end.<br />As a pet owner and a once helper at a No Kill Shelter<br />this movie moved me to tears on more than one occausion.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|This Kindle version of the book was very good and hard to put down! It kept me riveted until the end.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I never watched this show before - the previews didn't appeal to me - but once I started watching it - I had to go back and watch every episode from the beginning.  It is addictive!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  I have to admit that I was a little disappointed about book four.  Bringing in so many new characters was a little confusing and not having so many of our favorite characters featured in it, was a disappointment to me.  That being said, book five has more than made up for it and I am eagerly anticipating Book 6!  Get to work, George!!
B007KAJG3K|4.0|Ordered on black Friday for a steal, Robert Downey JR nails Sherlock Holmes and the movie delivers a great evenings worth off entertainment.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Wow, out of nowhere this book blew me away.  I relate it to Patrick Rothfuss's 'Name of the Wind' which I absolutely love.  It only follows one character (yes!), and the cadence of storytelling is very upbeat, never a dull moment.  Very interesting story.  Worth every penny.  Excited I have a new author to follow!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|The jetpack johyride ordered was received correctly, timely and as anticipated.  I will gladly re-order this item and similar ones again.
B004EBUXSA|4.0|Bought it for a home theater PC cannot complain it's been running 24 seven for the past year. Would definitely recommend
B00280LYIM|5.0|Amazing. I couldn't put it down, but the same thing goes for the other books in this spectacular series. Stupendous!
B0062NAX1U|4.0|the story line is predictable, but the moral to the story is uplifting and encouraging..good to show young teens the importance of standing up for what you believe in and carrying it out during your life
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My three year old daughter and I love it :). She begs me to play it lol. We also love the show.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Because I so thoroughly enjoyed sharing Downtown Abbey with my son I wanted to share this with my best friend.  So I have sent her this set as she is in another state now enjoying her second home there.  She called me today to let me know that she has received it and is this very moment curled up in her bed with her TV watching it as I write this (while hubby is probably off in another room watching The Big Bang Theory or something equally as entertaining for the male mind).  She is thrilled with it after hearing me talk about it for so long and not being able to get into it living between two states.  Hopefully, there will be a fourth season!<br /><br />The Downton Abbey story line takes place around the turn of the 20th century shortly before the WW I and afterwards.  The wealthy English family involved is extensive as is their house hold help.  There is a marked difference between the classes which helps explain all of that to we Americans who are totally unaware of being anything less than our imagined top of the heap, although most of us ARE NOT wealthy.  The characters are followed both in the upper class as well as the lower class downstairs where \\"the help\\" gathers to eat and socialize at the rather large table in the kitchen there.  We come to care for them all, some more than others as is true everywhere.  We identify with the problems of all.  Warning - this can be addictive.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|Always learn something new everytime I watch it. It is a real collectors film to be watched over and over.
0547884591|5.0|Meta Learning should be a 'household' learning technique for years. Brilliant way to look at learning new skill-sets. That is just part 1.<br /><br />This book has been instrumental to my learning (learning surf right now in El Salvador), language learning (Spanish) and my online businesses ([...]). I think it is especially helpful if you have read his other books, as a lot of the thinking ideologies piggy back off his other books. 4HC is definitely more comparable to the 4HB -- more spread out and 'choose your own adventure' esque...enjoy the ride.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|It's a cute movie, it may not be right for younger kids. My four year old likes it but he got a little scared.
B000002AGN|5.0|\\"Time Out\\" by The Dave Brubeck Quartet will always be one of the best instrumental jazz albums of all time. The arrangements are exceptional and I am mesmerized by the way these fine artists make every track a work of art. The music is further enhanced by what Amazon refers to as \\"the use of irregular meters in composition;\\" forget common time--this creative angle works. To be specific, there is the unmistakable influence of Balkan dance music in the time signatures for this album! In addition, the quality of the sound is excellent. After wearing out the grooves on the vinyl LP I picked up years ago, this remastered CD is a joy to listen to.<br /><br />There's not a bad track in the lot here and the result is that I don't really have a favorite number--the more I listened the more I came to love hearing it all! However, I will make one suggestion for newcomers to this style of music: listen especially for that sophisticated \\"Take Five\\" which you may already recognize (and the only number on this album not composed by Dave Brubeck but by Paul Desmond), the amazing \\"Blue Rondo &agrave; la Turk,\\" and the elegant \\"Pick Up Sticks.\\" It just may leave you wanting more!<br /><br />With Dave Brubeck on piano; Paul Desmond on saxophone; Joe Morello on drums, and Eugene Wright on bass you can't go wrong! This is instrumental classic jazz by some of the best musicians ever; and I highly recommend their music.  True, we may have lost Dave Brubeck today; but he lives on through his unforgettable artistry.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Is one of the most useful apps out there for downloading content on a WiFi only device. Great to playback video after a download where a slow connection is an issue.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|As a fan of the books I was pleased to hear it had been made into a series. Can't wait for season 2 to be released.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A gripping tale that doesn't seem all that far fetched. Suspense and drama around every turn from cover to cover! Worth your time no matter what your age.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Great album! Some of the songs lean heavily toward pop, but she manages to stay with her roots. It is truly an eclectic mix and the content has matured a bit from &#34;Fifteen&#34; to &#34;Twenty-Two&#34;. Surprisingly, the collaborations with Lightbody and Sheeran were some of the high points of the album. The disk apparently drops easily, so lock it up and don't let anyone borrow it, because it is a good one.
B005LAIHZE|4.0|I like this movie because the story of this show is quite different from the typical vampire movie.<br />I will recommend this movie to my friends.
B003WTE886|5.0|Great songs with meaningful content and catchy tunes. Also very fulfilling to finally be able to blast Taylor Swift songs from my car stereo.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|haven't read the other reviews, but the sheer numbers of them, and the high marks, should indicate the level of writing, of story, we have here. this is a classic, an instant classic. hesitate not! read it, in as quick a fashion as possible. in some ways, it reminds me of another classic, \\"a canticle for leibowitz\\". \\"wool\\" is science fiction of the highest order. it's about ideas, about a world view of our history as a people, as humans, on the earth. yes, it's a drama, but dramas that contain these ideas go beyond mere \\"entertainment\\"....they cross over to \\"art\\". that is what \\"wool\\" is, it's art. i cannot say more than to say it is, although very different in style, as great as the writing of neil gaiman. i can give no higher recommendation than that.
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|The DVD is fun to watch, but the true content is on the CD. The songs are great as always and I am proud to be the owner of this CD.
B00A0NOF7G|3.0|The story is ok and I did find myself laughing at times, but it was a pretty simple storyline.  I think readers would enjoy it if looking for a mindless bit of fun when they needed a break from real life.
B0014I4KH6|5.0|Great to listen to on a calm day home from school or long road trips. The content is family friendly, so play a lot of it when parents are in the car. Wish there were more songs, but all in all, a great product.
0061689246|5.0|Neil Gaiman is just so masterful.  I love his work.  I saw the movie of this first, and I might like the movie more.  However, the book has just as much to love.  It was a little more sensual than I would have imagined for a YA novel.  So if I parent is interested, watch out for that.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I wasn't sure about this movie at first because it didn't seem like it would be something I was really in to but I really ended up loving it
B0083Z614S|4.0|I just love these older books. If our young children today knew these kids of values, the world would be much better.
B000YHG72E|5.0|My grandchildren watch this every year, several times and Will Ferrell is so funny.  It really gets us in the Christmas Spirit
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Love this file manager. Takes a few minutes to figure out how things work. Makes it easy to move photos to and from my Kindle Fire. Network access is great. Works with my server and NAS drives!
B008XBASVY|5.0|this is such an amazing story. There's not many stories out there about the smart kid's struggle to make their dreams come true, so it's amazing to see something like that written in such a fun, witty way. Way to go Chris Colfer!
B00984668E|5.0|I was a little nervous with Warp Riders.  It seemed like the Sword were veering off into another territory, so to speak.  No one will believe this now, but Warp Riders sounded to me like they had been listening to a lot of ZZ Top instead of Black Sabbath.  (I feel like the cover of &#34;Cheap Sunglasses&#34; proves that point.)  Apocryphon seems like a return to the sound they got on Age of Winters and Gods of the Earth, which I'm quite pleased about.
1476719071|5.0|this is an amzing story. I love all the charactors and the story line. i highly recommend this book if you like a good love story
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Just so-so. Like some of his latest novels this one was strange and went on too long with weird ending
B006WAIV6M|5.0|This book explains that habits (both those which serve us and those that don't) make life easier for our brains.  Whether these habits are acquired accidentally (not deliberately) or are installed, it is within us to create powerful new habits, following the four-step process outlined in the book.  Making these improvements isn't necessarily easy, but is possible.<br /><br />The four steps involve intervening in the Cue, Response, Reward habit loop.  Become aware of the cues that lead to specific patterns of thought or behaviour and experiment with altering your responses in a way which leads to acceptable rewards.<br /><br />It takes a healthy dose of awareness, but is worth it.<br /><br />Well written.  I couldn't put it down.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Its hard for me to wait for new books by author so glad I bought it. Ps no way is Tom cruise a good fit for Reacher in a movie!
B005Z28M58|5.0|It's DVDs. No scratches, They all watch fine, no problems. It arrived on time and in good condition. A good buy for the wife.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham's books are always good.  You think you know what is going to happen but there is always a twist in the story.  It seems one can learn lots of information in prison. One can also sharpen other skills. The story moves quickly and is a fast read.
B00646UU5Y|4.0|Ok, you are just here to have fun. The premise of pre historic animals coming through a portal into our time is just fun. A British program with truly good acting.
B001NLKT60|5.0|A must read in the trilogy.  One must read the first book to understand the 2nd and 3rd books for they are all tied together.  Not knowing anything about Sweden made it a little difficult to follow, but it is worth the time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is INCREDIBLE. If you haven't watched it, you haven't died. It's the best thing on television hands down and not just because undead are walking around, but it gives you (IMO) a damned good approximation of what it will be like when just getting to tomorrow is a battle. When everyday is clouded by the very real fear that you might not make it to tomorrow, what does that do to you, what does that do to everybody. This show is terrifying not because of zombies, but because of the terrifying reality that the HUMAN animal is only one or two weeks of no showers, no food and no hope away.
B007HO392S|5.0|Always liked her voice, singing and videos.<br />if you like her buy this album.<br />Enjoy<br />......................<br />......................<br />......................<br />.......................<br />.......................
B003SI9WYG|5.0|This is and always will be a classic movie for all ages.It is a collectors must have.Tim Burton make's the coolest movie's and they all are fun and dark.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|Good product for the money! Durable. The only feature I don't like it the narrow elastic to hold onto it for reading.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Love the action and the little history lesson.This man Abraham Lincoln made history for ALL folks.He was a depressed person like me.so I feel how he must of felt....
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a fun way to play bingo and pass the time.Like the graphics. Recommended if you like to play Bingo!
0451169514|5.0|My daughter wanted this book for summer reading.  She loved it so much, she read it twice and asked for the movie version for Christmas.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I enjoyed reading The Hunger Games and the other books in the trilogy. Good plot. Lots of action. Well written!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the intrigue, drama, and suspense wrapped up in this first book.  Looking forward to seeing where the next book leads.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this audible version is absolutely incredible. I wish every Kindle came with this app already downloaded. this app is a wonderful resource for Bible study.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good book to read after work and that everyone is talking about. Cant wait to read the rest of the books.
B000FA5SMK|2.0|Although I finished reading this entire book, there were so many boring and irrelevant chapters I could have just as easily skipped them.  The premise was a good one, and there were moments when one could empathise with the \\"hero\\" but his actions quickly ended all feelings of credibility.<br />Read the other 1 and 2 star reviews- they are all accurate
0756914582|5.0|Although my favorite of his young adult books is still The Wee Free Men.  Pratchett has a way of pointing out our oh-so-human foibles, not to mention our equally human cruelties, in a way that is both kind and inspiring.  He also exalts the power of imagination without being in the least pedantic.  And he's damned funny.
1452101248|5.0|Although I love to cook, I have only a handful of cookbooks that I have used regularly over the years and, after 50+ years of cooking, I still turn to those torn, annotated, sauce-stained pages again and again.  But like many people these days, I have been looking for lighter food and more vegetables in my cooking.  An enthusiastic review of this book inspired me to buy it, and it has opened up a new world of fine vegetarian cooking that I never knew was possible.  Who knew that vegetables could taste so wonderful.  I think the secret is that Ottolenghi doesn't try to make the vegetables taste like meat substitutes.  Rather these brilliant blendings of vegetables,herbs and spices make one forget about meat altogether.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, some of the ingredients are not easy to find.  In some cases, I have made an effort to search them out; in others I have sought the best substitutes that seem to come closest to what is intended.  And, of course, sometimes I just take off on the idea and create something new altogether with whatever ingredients I have to hand.  All these approaches have worked well and more and more often, I am turning to this cookbook when trying to decide what to prepare.  At this rate, \\"Plenty\\" will soon be as worn and stained as my old standbys, Julia Child, Craig Claiborne, and Pierre Franey.  And with much healthier food!
0547564651|5.0|\\"But wisdom is justified by all her children.\\" -- Luke 7:35 (NKJV)<br /><br />When a group of adults shows up for one of my night-school classes on how to develop a business, I always cringe after learning that most of them are well educated. It's typically my least well-schooled students who create the businesses that transform their lives and those of their employees and customers.<br /><br />When I try to explain the point, I often emphasize differences in curiosity and in not being satisfied with the conventional answer. Those with lots of education seem to display lots of test-taking skills, but they don't seem to have any other abilities that would be useful. Worse still, they reject the idea of having to go out and develop their own experimental results to decide what to do more and less of. They, instead, think that running a business is just like solving an algebra problem: there's only one answer and it's just a few steps away. Wrong!<br /><br />Paul Tough has done a good work by searching out information and examples that point to the importance of skills other than test-taking for allowing someone to accomplish more in life.<br /><br />Both liberals and conservatives will find information here to confound their pet beliefs. Yes, young children are permanently harmed by being in violent environments. That harm doesn't, however, make it impossible for them to accomplish as much or more than someone else ... but it will take a lot more effort and perseverance.<br /><br />Curiosity counts for a lot, as it does for my business students. The answers to most things we need to do are all around us. Those who are curious will keep poking around until they find something that works (remember the story of Edison trying and failing thousands of times before inventing a practical light bulb?).<br /><br />Do we have a formula we can follow so all children will succeed? No, of course not. But in the same way that we have learned to appreciate that there are multiple intelligences (although anyone who reads the Bible would have known that many years earlier), this book points to the importance of people learning how to measure and build character, curiosity, and enthusiasm for doing what's difficult.<br /><br />Is this a perfect book? No, of course not. Is it well worth your time? Sure it is.<br /><br />Bravo, Mr. Tough.telligences (although anyone who reads the Bible would have known that many years earlier), this book points to the importance of people learning how to measure and build character, curiosity, and enthusiasm for doing what's difficult.<br /><br />Is this a perfect book? No, of course not. Is it well worth your time? Sure it is.<br /><br />Bravo, Mr. Tough.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Nowhere near done with reading the book, but already so worth the cost!  Top notch just like Tim's other books.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|This review will contain some plot elements.<br /><br />As with most movie adaptations, the book was a better story and this was no exception. Some plot elements that I thought were relevant, were missing or completely changed from the book. Granted, having to tell an entirely first person story from a spectating perspective has to be difficult but the plot didn't have to be sacrificed to get there. The hovercraft in the beginning had no relevance since it was a flashback to when she recognized one of the servants after arriving at the Capitol. The mockingjay wasn't picked up in the Hob. Haymitch was introduced into the story earlier in the book than in the movie. The Capitol was more of a spectacle than it was. Even parts of the games were different, especially the finale. Thresh was thought to have died by Cato, not the muttations. No heat wave driving them together. No face to face with Cato as he ran from the muttations. And no realization that the Capitol had somehow genetically engineered them from the dead tributes.<br /><br />I believe that the ultimate goal was to tell Katniss' story throughout the book and develop the discontent for the Capitol. This building up seemed to be lacking in the movie. Perhaps it will get better when Catching Fire sees it's theatrical release. Here's hoping it stays a little truer to the book this time around.
B007EW9ISM|4.0|I've gone through many styluses on my iPad. Most of them have flimsy tips that break after a month or so. The Cosmonaut is going strong. I can write very nicely with it and it has a nice weight to it. It's not as easy to carry around as other styluses, but it's worth it.
B000V4UFZK|5.0|This Halloween movie is perfect for people who are sick of bloody violence.  Although kids under 10-12 might still get scared from seeing the kids &#34;taken.&#34;  The special effects are hysterical now, but they don't ruin the movie.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|It is a cut story ...The dog becomes the story teller.  I found it a bit strange but is well written and entertaining.  Don't think I would recomend it to my friends to read because it is a bit strange.
1439102813|5.0|What an amazing book, one of the best I've read this year.  Written by the perfect person in every way.  Not only does Lisa Genova have the professional background to write this book, she obviously cares about the Early Onset community, and it shows.  Easy to read, but surprisingly complex and thorough.  I have no experience with Alzheimers, but it really interested me anyway.  Am leading a book group discussion on this novel tonight!
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Was not the best movie on the shelf but pretty sexy!! If you like a little bit of a story line, and a lot of hunk. This is for you.
0547884591|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the 4 hour body and this book is extremely helpful and I'm not even very interested in cooking. I love the unorthodox ideals he puts fourth and I really enjoy listening to him and reading his work. Keep it up Tim, thank you for the help and changing my life. Keep up with the jits.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I love this movie and wanted to get the 65th anniversary edition and I am so glad I did. It has both the B/W and color versions. I have not watched it however, there is more on these two discs than just the movie so I'm anxious to see what else is there to view.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Llego antes de lo imprevistoo, estaba programado para el 12 de diciembre y llego el 3 de diciembre, Voy viendo 2 peliculas y la imagen es excelente al igual que el sonido
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I expected this movie to be ok, but not great. I was so wrong! My daughter & I have watched this movie over and over, and never get tired of The Polar Express. It has a great story and adventure. I'm not a huge Tom Hanks fan, but he does an amazing job and plays many rolls, some of which I did not recognize his voice until I read the credits. We originally bought the DVD, but there are so many parts in the movie that would be enhanced by blue ray, so I have now ordered the blue ray as well. Hope you enjoy it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awesome game and loved the movies. I'm in my mid twenty's and love the game and I would digest it to others
1444737112|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book.  It is about a man who takes in a stray cat and a very<br />amazing relationship begins.  Both help each other.  One of those books that you<br />just can't put down.
B009SQRC9E|5.0|We found this movie while looking for something else and just love it. My three year old calls it the &#34;Cute&#34; movie. &#34;Mommy, can i watch that cute movie?&#34;
B00004T9UF|5.0|The Marshall Mathers LP is one of a few rap albums in my opinion that could/should be labeled as a classic.
1401233791|5.0|reading this book is no small task, but it is a classic. I'm sure like many I read this before the dark knight rises and It did help me enjoy it more.
B009FZFONO|5.0|some plot parts are truly very disturbing for my taste and I leave the room for a bit. But my husband would not agree with me so on his behalf, 5 stars since it was he who purchased it and he can't say enough about this show. (eh, whatever)
B00574Q7PQ|4.0|Good action and storyline.<br />Just don't criticize obvious flaws in the plot like when he goes back to the airport for his lost briefcase (really how could he forget something so important, I would have never let it out of my hands). Or why he has a change of heart from his previous life or why the taxi driver keeps helping him. Just watch and enjoy how the story unfolds.
B001EYU1VO|4.0|Very good product. No flaws. Just very very hard to set up. but overal this is a very  nice works with mac and pc.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Many people has complaints about this box...<br />We do not. My whole family is delighted.<br />Sound in Abbey Road, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's, Let it be, Rubber Soul is great.<br /><br />No cracks or pops and the most important thing:no rumble.<br /><br />My box is from Capitol, USA.<br /><br />I have many Beatles Lp Collections: The Blue Box (british prints), The First Digital Lp's from 1988 (Mexican prints and lot's of rumble); the original prints in mono and stereo from many different countries and labels and so on. Specially the Blue Box has great sound.<br /><br />For reproduction we used a Clear Audio Wood cartridge on a ST-8 Harman Kardon turntable, with a Rabco arm.<br /><br />The box set was a gift of my wife and my three sons. Sound is outstanding.<br />That's all.
B00A72989U|5.0|We have all of her music and once again she has not disappointed us.  She has so much talent. I would highly recommend this CD to everyone who enjoys good music.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works fine on my kindle fire. I keep track of several cities and have had perfect performance. I use the extended forecast information when taking trips.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|I got this set for my six year old son. It is a little challenging for him, but with some help from his dad, my son has already built the spaceship. My son easily spends six-eight hours working on this toy all by himself. He is also learning a lot about spaceships and how they work.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|I found the story line shallow and it was slow.  The sarcasm was over done and tiresome.  Wouldn't recommend to a friend.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Was extremely hesitant about any show with zombies. Couldn't believe how damn good the show was after watching an episode. Great charachters, good acting, excellent plots. If you don't want to get hooked into watching every single episode, then I would recommend not sampling any of these. Holy crap, I can't wait to watch the next one!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I can't get enough of Mitch Rapp. Kind of eerie how Flynn's books seem so up to date with current foreign affairs.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I was very excited to finally hear what &#34;P-Squared&#34; had put together in his debut CD and I must say that I was not disappointed in the least.  While I always liked hearing the spin he put on the well known songs written by others during his AI run, I very much enjoyed finally being able to hear him sing his own compositions as I always feel that that is what gives us a truer picture of who the artist is and where they would like to &#34;fit&#34;.  So, well done PP!!!
B008F2AKUA|5.0|When I think of my nascent years as a non-discerning music fan, my brain is flooded with many a one hit wonder, from Eddie Grant to Brenda K Starr to Quiet Riot. But the three musical acts that keep coming up as a child of the '80's time and time again are Michael Jackson, Hall & Oates, and Huey Lewis & The News, in no particular order. I heard 'Heart & Soul' on 101 the other day, and realized how The News music, while critically panned, wrote nothing more than earworms, working their way into your brain, and eventually youur heart. What more can you ask of a rock act? Is that not the ultimate goal of any band? To write a song that can't leave your listener's head? I had to have that song, and NOW. Once I got home, I fired up my computer and downloaded this album. For any child of the 1980's or ironical Brooklynite with a mustache and a chain of keys to no particular doors, this is a must have for any music lover. Sometimes, it is INDEED, hip to be square.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Wow! Totally unexpected story line with fantastic twists and turns throughout the story.  I couldn't seem to put the book down.  Just when I thought I knew the story, something different would happen.  Great story.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I had heard of this game from others and wondered why the hoopla.  So when I got my Kindle Fire I downloaded it and now I know what the hoopla is all about.  This is a very addicting game - and lots of fun too!!!
B008N1V11U|4.0|It is a great game.  Lots of fun, great graphics.  Got it because I love the movie.  The plot of the game mirrors the movie.
0446580848|5.0|Good story - vivid picture created with words. The wit displayed by the author is truely impressive. Every paragraph is worthwhile and entertaining. Recently met Mr. DeMille at a book signing. He is a true gentlement. His are the only books that I would read twice. What a great pleasure. I purposely read the book slowly to savor each page. Already can't wait for his next book - - hope he does another Corey novel.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The third book in the series was good but not as good as the first 2 books. but I had to read it
B005NJU8PA|5.0|As myself being a self development maniac Tim showed the way again. He is the ultimate out of the box skill gaining master. The book opened my eyes to brand new aspects to things already in front of my eyes. I wish Tim were the Minister of Education of Hungary. He would manage it in 4 hours a week.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My daughter loves this movie. I do too. It has a great message hidden about mother-daughter relationships.<br />Thumbs up for Disney one more time.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This is a fun little game to pass the time. Kids an bronies alike will enjoy it. But if kids are playing, might want to be sure to lock off the pay options. All in All good fun and all the fun characters from the show!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|This was a good solid end for the trilogy. This story certainly had more politics and intrigue than the other two, but once I waded through it I felt that the payoff was worthwhile. As with each of the books, I was charmed by Larsson's quirky habit of sharing the minutiae of the characters' daily lives, like what everyone was wearing, eating, etc. From my limited perspective, it seems that everyone in Sweden is obsessed with (in descending order) coffee, sandwiches, sleeping with anyone who looks at you twice, gray slacks, cell phone brands, Olof Palme, and cigarettes. In addition, the concept of an international Robin Hood-esque hacker community made me smile and I hope it really exists out there somewhere.
B00062PN6I|5.0|Yo, for the money you pay, this is almost the best deal you can get.<br /><br />Pros: price, comfortable for basic use, fair noise blocking, sound quality is rather good. The bass is  good. Durability: it look like it will last a longer if you take care of it really good, because it not made of really strong materials.<br /><br />Cons: actually for the price you pay, you really can't say much about it. If you can get cheaper and better quality than this, there you go, but I am not so sure. I would not recommend this for people who travels a lot, have kids, or doing pro work with audios. It does not seem it is made for rough handling.<br /><br />Overall: I would say, its really good for basic daily use. Sound quality is very good for the price you pay.
B008IYSMLY|5.0|I love Dexter and season 6 did not disappoint.  My only problem was stopping before watching the entire season in one setting.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I cant play it at all. it is always upside down. No matter which way I turn it. Even though I got a brand new hd Kindle. No fun at all.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a great app. It does work and  has a place were you can set it to only go of on a day you choose. You can also have many apps at one time!
B009CPEOC4|5.0|What could have been self indulgent and obnoxious, think Truth or Dare, turned out to be an honest glimpse into what the pop start deals with on a daily basis. Bravo! Having watched this &#34;rockumentary&#34; I have a better appreciation and respect for Ms. Perry. Thoroughly enjoyable.
B006YC74E8|4.0|I wanted a pic of my cat under the Christmas tree & it worked great. Get this it really does work. . My gallery is full of pics.

B009VLXMJA|5.0|This is a great album, it has something for everyone, she is so talented and the more I listen the more I love it.
0553582038|2.0|Thanks for sucking me in with three very engaging and interesting books: only in the fourth to ignore more than half of the characters that were the focus of those books!<br /><br />I feel like I've been strung along with multiple new characters that I don't have the energy for, even if they did have more than 1 or 2 chapters to develop, while getting very little meaningful story in return!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watch this show and let the obsession begin! This is the best thing since the six hour version of pride and prejudice.
B004GTKP3S|4.0|I purchase this for my wife so this review is from her...Very entertaining.  The actors in this are fantastic. Streaming was very good although there was a hiccup or two (probably from our end vs Amazon).
B008518MOW|5.0|Men In Black is one of our all time favorite movie series.  MIB3 does not disappoint.  Not high brow, but definitely entertaining, and can be viewed over and over again without becoming boring.  The writers in each of the three movies (as well as this one) have come up with many interesting twist and a neat overall story to tell.
1423140605|5.0|Awesome book.... can't wait for the next one!! :) Amazing book with a great plot, well developed characters... and a story that you will LOVE!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love Pinterest! Once I found out there was an App and it was free, I had to have it. I use it daily. I highly recommend this App.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I like this Marware Revolve Case for my seven-inch Kindle Fire HD. A lot. It's solid, well-made and does exactly what it says it will do. It protects my investment.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1) The Marware Revolve allows for hands-free viewing in both portrait and landscape formats.<br />2) Your Kindle snaps into the case firmly and doesn't come out unless *you* take it out.<br />3) This case has an elastic band that holds it firmly closed when your Kindle Fire HD is not in use. Plus, it looks sleek and professional.<br />4) I actually DROPPED my Kindle Fire HD on my tile bedroom floor, while it was secured in this case -- and it came through in perfect condition! YEAH!<br /><br />CONS:<br />1) The case comes with an online video for use. Just sayin'...<br /><br />The Marware Revolve comes in a variety of colors. (My personal fave is the Hot Pink.) It's easy to use and truly protects my Kindle Fire HD from my clumsy-tude. Any case that can do *that* gets five stars from me!!!<br /><br />Note: It fits ONLY the Kindle Fire HD 7\\".
B005OCFHHK|5.0|great box set, no complaints here get it you will not be disappointed, merry xmas to all and a great new years as well...
B0095XPZBC|3.0|Having been excited by the first season set and even attending the Fathom even previewing both \\"Q Who\\" and \\"The Measure Of A Man\\" Extended version, I was looking forward to this set.<br /><br />I started with all the new extras, which look great and offer some great insight into the season.  However, when I started watching the episodes, they left me highly disappointed.  The first season set looked absolutely amazing, but this set features way too many scenes plagued by excessive grain that it almost looks like its snowing from the excessive digital noise.  And yet, other scenes or different camera angles from the same scene look great.  Its a real mixed bag.  I was hoping it might just be a bad couple of scenes in one episode, but it's a problem plaguing the entire set.  I don't know if it's the compensating for the dark lighting of this season but it doesn't have the same WOW factor as the season one set despite being much better stories than most of the first season (\\"Shades of Grey\\" episode excluded from that assessment.)<br /><br />Despite the annoying grainy scenes the set is definitely an improvement over the DVD.  Many of these episodes I haven't seen since the release of the DVD version of this season.  If the outsourcing stories are true, I hope that CBS Digital and Paramount make it right.
B001GWK2MC|1.0|This toy is expensive for what you get and nobody has a warranty for it. My boys are 2 and 3 and they only used it a couple of times and then it ripped at the seams of 2 of the towers. I am not sure how a 3-6 year old would be able to play with ruining it. I will not, would not and cannot reccomend this product to anyone.
B00684J49U|5.0|We just finished watching this, the ending was so sad. I can't wait till next season. You just can't stop watching it.
B00117W1HQ|5.0|Everything about this show is well done and worth the $!  It's fun to go back and watch the beginning.
0761169253|5.0|Wise but never preachy, this is a great book for anyone who is considering a life in the arts. Kleon accurately depicts the pitfalls of the process of craft while still reveling in the wonder of being able to create without fear.
B000AMJC2K|2.0|I think mine was put together wrong because there is no way to adjust the outer arm, I tried to adjust it but it is pretty much locked in place. It has the style and look to be a nice arm but the fact it just does not adjust ruined it for me. If i was able to i would have returned it, but being out of the country i didnt have that luxury
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I loved the music, the visuals, the young actors, and the story. I tell everyone to watch it and have listened to the soundtrack countless times.
B008NQYWC0|2.0|Every book that is super long carries its own demons I always say. 11/22/63 does just that. I went into this book expecting one thing and was given another. Now to be honest, this isn't my fault. The book's title clearly states that it is called 11/22/63, the day that Kennedy is assassinated as many know. Well, to point out this is an extreme case of false advertisement. A more suitable title would be: Screwing around in History from 1958-1963.<br /><br />  It has been quite a long time since a single character frustrated me so much as did Jake Epping/George Amberson. Every time I turned around I was letting out huge sighs at how silly this man actually was.<br /><br />  Let's start off with this knowledge. He knows that he will be heading into the past to change history. He talks with the owner of the portal about the Butterfly effect. He even states himself that he knows full well that his actions, and when I say actions, I mean any action: Ordering toast, talking to someone, his mere existence in a time not of his own cand cause serious ramifications down the line. So with that knowledge, what would a normal person do? Not what Jake Epping does, no sir! He decides that he will start teaching at a school. Interacting with dozens of children an hour, every hour, for two solid years. Not so bright for a teacher I say. That poor butterfly must have died it flapped its wings so hard.<br /><br />  So armed with his idiocy and for some reason the thing swinging between his britches like he is some teenage boy meeting a girl for the first time he continues to be silly for several years in the past.<br /><br />  Stephen King implements an idea early on that \\"Time\\" is trying to stop him from preventing the main character from changing history. By even suggesting that idea, it opens the door to the claim that if that is the case that \\"Time\\" would be daily hindering him, since the main character is preventing an history from running its course every day, for five freakin' years.<br /><br />  Now, if the book had a fitting title that claimed it was more of a man's interactions with people in a small town in the \\"land of ago\\" rather than tricking you into thinking the main point of the story is about preventing the assassination of a president then I would have come in knowing the full nature of the book. Also, the length of the book was a little too long. This nearly 900 page book has within its pages a really good 400 page story. Too much detail goes into, in my opinion, really boring events. A school play (which brought everyone to tears), a football game, a school dance, the lindy hop, a wedding, a funeral, another school play (which of course was supposedly amazing also), eating bacon, driving on the road, another dance, watching a fight, having sex with a boring smoker woman who comes with her own set of issues. Yes. That's right. Those scenes have to be the worst!  I tried to skim through as best I could, but couldn't help stop what can't be undone. Because why you must ask? Because the past is obdurate. Yep, by the way you're gonna end up hating that word, and I hope you can come away from the novel and not have your world shattered by the mere mention of the word \\"poundcake\\" ~shudder~!<br /><br />  This book by far misses the mark for me.  The book takes place over the course of 5 years, it shouldn't feel like I spent 5 years there myself. So many times I caught myself saying, \\"Come on, let's go!!\\" Every day was described in epic detail far beyond the capacity of its need. \\"I pulled out my pen, took off the cap, wrote down something, pondered what I wrote, opened the drawer of my desk, put the pen therein, closed the drawer, I picked a booger from my nose and flicked it to the floor, and marveled at the sound it made. There was ka-swoosh as it collided with the carpet, I stood, stretched my legs that were by now aching, I realized I needed the pen so I put the pen in my pocket, walked to the door, twisted the knob, it creaked loudly, opened the door, walked through the entryway, pulled the door closed, pulled my keys from my pocket, retrieved my keys, locked the door, put my keys back into my pocket, walked to my car, pulled out my keys again, unlocked the car, the hinges squealed like a pig at a butcher's shop, closed the door, sat on the bucket seat. Then I forgot why I got into the car to begin with, did I need milk, or was it eggs. Perhaps I should got back inside and see what I wrote down. I opened the door.\\" It was scenes like this that grated my nerves.  It was like someone followed this guy around and dictated his every movement.<br /><br />  King really needs an editor, a good one too, that can go through his manuscripts and just start pulling out all the fluff, and that might have made all the difference in the world for me. I'm sure many people probably loved it, but because of the flaws I came across this book ends up as just an average read.udly, opened the door, walked through the entryway, pulled the door closed, pulled my keys from my pocket, retrieved my keys, locked the door, put my keys back into my pocket, walked to my car, pulled out my keys again, unlocked the car, the hinges squealed like a pig at a butcher's shop, closed the door, sat on the bucket seat.

B009NQKXYK|1.0|So we went to another planet to find our supposed origins?  And we were surprised that when we trampled all over the inside of an alien structure, violated every good security rule and abandoned all common sense we got killed in short order?  And the robot who was sent along started a good deal of the trouble.  Doesn't anyone read Asimov?<br />This movie is for dummies.  It has a great premise but no promise.  Why does every science fiction film have to be a horror flick? Ugh!!!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I really like this game. But there is not enough levels. I believe that I have finished the extras and now there is nothing else to do. No more special prizes to get.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I loved this movie so much that I saw it three times in the theater and bought it when it was released.  Have always been a fan of British acting and Judi Dench gives another brilliant performance in this movie.  What I loved most, however, was the portrayal of India.  This isn't the India that Hollywood normally presents, but having been to India twice in the last two years, this is the India I met and the reason I went back the second time and will go again.  &#34;The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&#34; depicts the India I met--an India of crowds, chaos, and kindness.  Definitely the best movie I have seen this year.  If you like British acting and enjoyed &#34;The King's Speech,&#34; you are almost assured of enjoying this movie enough to buy it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing Bingo, it relaxes me. I also play on the computer. The only difference is you don't get to play the tournaments on the KindleFire.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After hearing all the hype about this series, I read the first book out of curiosity. It exceeded my expectations and kept me emotionally connected to all the characters. I will definitely be reading the next two books.
B0086700CM|1.0|Did not like this game at all ! I did not know anything about this game when I accidently downloaded it.
B008WCP2PG|2.0|I'm not a Cha-tum fan, sorry. The movie/plot just didn't do it for me and I'm the typical female who loooves things like 300 Abs ( I mean Gerard Butler in 300) and such, but this was just bleh. The ONLY decent thing was Channing Tatum's dancing skills. Everyone else bored me to death. It got really monotonous after 15 minutes...AND predictable. Unless you're a big Tatum fan, don't buy it, let alone see it!
B009FXIICK|5.0|This is a match-three game that would be perfect for small children. The animations are fun and it is easy to play. I wouldn't recommend this for adults... its a bit too childish for that. But this would be a good way to keep the little ones entertained for a while.
B009MF56GC|4.0|More action/explosion/action stars. Van Damme did great as a villain. Chuck Norris was a nice humorous addition. All around, they gave the cameos more screen time. As a girl, I really enjoyed this manly movie. It helped that there was less romance this time around. I certainly did not intentionally watch an action movie for the romance.  It was a fun watch and I think most guys will like it. It had some good lines from your classic action heroes :-P
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Love this movie so much , it's on my Christmas list. I don't normally buy movies but this one's a keeper.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My 5 year old adores all the new Tinker Bell movies and they are one of the few I enjoy watching with her. This one was great....stunning colors just like the others with a nice story.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|grandkids love this movie so much they wore it out. this is the second one I have bought for them ......
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|The horrible use of pseudo science to pull all of the disparate things together in the latter half of the book is just horrible. Harkness would do herself well to consult with an anthropologist and geneticist before trying to fit evolutionary theory as the driving force behind the plot. Even the X-men comic book did a better job (this is not a compliment) using science to drive plot. Note: Evolution does not proceed toward anything. It's what happens when the genetic diversity that already exists interacts with the world. There are no goals or plateaus in evolution upon which nature hangs it hat. There's no ladder or point to step off the train and say &#34;We've arrived&#34;.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|lots of sex lots of blood and violence, this season just like previous one really really good, Liam Mclntyre did a good job.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I have read every Jack Reacher story written by Lee Child.  This was typical Jack Reacher, his feel for what is right, always wins out. Shortly after finishing this story, I saw an ad for a movie based on a Lee Child book featuring Jack Reacher.  But, the man playing Reacher is that short little actor Tom Cruise, he hardly matches up the discriptions of Reacher in Child's books.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|This season is nothing like the last one, its more creepy and gruesome. Last season was more like drama with some evil twist this season they combined all the evil and scary things that can be imagined and put in in this season. I personally love this season why I gave it 4 stars is that some parts kind of gross me out ...if you too sensitive you should not watch that show, however if you are ready for anything than this show is for you. This show will have crazy killer, sadistic doctor, monsters,aliens, exorcism, devil possession....
B00005UL6G|5.0|The only way I could afford a copy of the original Wicker Man was to buy the British Version and download a player for my laptop to watch it there.  It was worth it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show out there, is just keeps getting better and better. This season will keep you on the edge until the end.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its great! I love playing the game. its fun and entertaining and for everyone! I play it all the time
B0002ADY1A|3.0|Originally released in 1972, Demons and Wizards is generally viewed as a high point in this band's career, at least for the early line-up of David Byron (vocals), Ken Hensley (keyboards) and Mick Box (guitar).  The songwriting was generally strong.  With the exception of the mercifully short seventh track, the melodic ideas are consistently interesting, while the keyboard-oriented arrangements result in a very full sound.  The 12-minute medley Paradise / The Spell showcases the band's instrumental talents, but arguably runs on a bit too long. This edition features remastering and several bonus tracks.  The main reason to prefer this edition is the sound engineering.  All the instruments and vocals are crystal clear.  The bonus material does not really add much.  The most notable addition is the 11-minute version of Why.  However, the shorter, edited versions of this track were preferable.  3.5 stars.
0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is my favorite book.

B00AA7O22U|2.0|It was sad to watch all these action stars end up in this washing machine movie. Stupid of me to expect anymore.
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|We received this as a gift - and while I will say that the kids are having A LOT of fun with it I can not believe the price tag!  The figures are cute, the Darth maul Santa is neat but 50 bucks is really silly and overpriced. I can't give it 5 stars because of the blatant cash grab by Lego.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I chose this book at random and am very pleased that i did. its a great read - fast paced and gory and weird enough at the same time to keep you wondering what the heck is going on - all to be revealed right at the end. i'm sure there's a fitting metaphor in there somewhere but i just can't put my thought on it right now - something about accepting what you have in front of you is not always the worst thing in the world.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its ok. its suckes with out wifi and I thank that the coins should be colllected when the people are not on ice age. village.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|As an action/martial arts movie buff, I thought I had seen it all. \\"The Raid: Redemption\\" completely blew me away with its unique action sequences. The hand-to-hand combat was fast paced and exciting, the gun play was suspenseful, and even the blades were used in incredible manner. It's been a while since an action film delivered such non-stop excitement. The plot is simple and easy to follow. For those of you who are into action films with deep plots, the action in this film very well makes up for it. If you're in the mood to see some complete non-stop ass-kicking action, buy this movie! You will not be disappointed!
B0094KORXI|5.0|My son and I love to watch this movie.  We've watched it at least 20 times.  Great movie.  Great message.
B008Y7IFSA|3.0|I am basing this review off of my kids' reaction (boys - 11 & 9; girl - 4). My 9 year old liked it the most and my 11 year old enjoyed the humor. It didn't keep my 4-year old's attention and she liked the Muppet movie a lot. It's too bad, because this is one of my wife's favorites.
B00271SFB6|5.0|Very crisp picture viewing it on Amazon Prime. But, some of the dialogue was washed out by the action sequences: subtitles would be nice..
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My most favorite game ever! I drink my apple juice while playing this game, and its good! So I recommend playing this game with apple juice. Peace out and have a Merry Birthday!!!!!
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Munro has lost none of her wit and narrative skills in her most recent collection.  She continues to demonstrate why she is the best short story writer in English.

B0048WQDIE|5.0|Years after the book's release, Joseph Heller's classic tale of war and insanity remain a shining light in the annals of satire. The thrust of this story is the characters, always quirky and often lovable, which even today, are unique, tragic, and funny as hell. Read it!<br /><br />Jeff Davis, Author of Snaggler's Paradise
B0009VSB06|5.0|Love this little item. Still have not gone out to look for gold but i cant wait to use it.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I had this on VHS - no one uses VHS any more. I wanted a DVD and for a very reasonable price I got a regular DVD and a Blue Ray DVD too. So if I ever get a Blue Ray player I will be able to have a DVD that works in that player too!
B005LAII62|1.0|Overall it just wasn't funny. Very dry. Not entertaining. I bought this thinking it would be well put together show like coraline, but it isn't. Boy in show has a boyfriend. Other references that aren't for kids. It just isn't very fun to watch.
0547884591|5.0|This is a book you must have.  HUGE, full-color and packed full of thoughtful and well researched information.  I really enjoyed the various detours from cooking throughout the book.  If you're the type that searches the internet for all the questions/ideas that pop into your head - while delighting in the new random (at the time) information you find  - then you'll really enjoy the book's format.  The book has a definite core structure and theme, but lots of great little side trips along the way!  Many other books offer only the same old (often) boring steps of assembling ingredients; you will learn WAY MORE with this one.  Enjoy!
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I recently attended a Leonard Cohen Concert in Seattle, WA It was one of the most beautiful and moving experiences.  He is a great musican that connects with his audience and is gives all his has.  His also was very generous regarding the length of his concert, without hesitation.  His band members are great musicians too.  One of the best concerts that I have been to.

B00A8ECU24|4.0|This review would be 5 stars if the game didn't have two purchaseable currencies. Also if the purchaseable currencies weren't all but required to complete the quests. The tuning as far as the amount of gems required for purchases needs to be adjusted.

B003XF1OK4|5.0|I really am enjoying this book.  I saw the movie first, and since the book is usually better than the movie I have been looking forward to reading it and so far I am not dissapointed.  The characters are very humaan - flaws and all.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|as soon as I finished the first I couldn't wait to read the second. I read it in 2 days and didn't want it to end. There was a lot of twist and turns which kept you wanting more.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the entire book, I finished it in less than a week. I'm really looking forward to the next book.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|For me this book started out very slow not until a little over half the book did I get really into it. But once I got into it I couldn't put it down.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Purchased this watch a few weeks ago and couldn't be more pleased.  I don't like metal wristbands, but the green fabric wristband looks great and is extremely comfortable.  Really no con's yet.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|Great flick, filled with all the has-beens; ya gotta love &#34;wrinkles&#34;, especially in HD but like us folks, these guys are getting old!!  Would recommend it to anyone who loves action!!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Loved this movie. We watch it every year on Christmas Eve.It's one of the funniest movies to watch during the holidays.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Liked all the previous Reacher books I read, but this had no beginning (how did he get injured) and ending, why Virginia?<br />It was the middle between two book ends
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The first book was almost a complete mirror to the grey series, but this one Sylvia Day did not disappoint. I cant wait for the next one.
B009157BWU|5.0|Love monkeyes and apes of all kind will defentley get this one.cant wait to buy it.loved the movies very much,
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Halfway through this book I told myself that if I just suspended my belief that the plot would prove interesting.  Didn't work.  Even reading the book as if it were science fiction, it still turn out to be a dud.
B005NJU8PA|3.0|I liked the four hour workweek best. Next in line the four hour body. What I liked most about this one was the meta chapter.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|So this season is totally different than last season, but I cannot stop watching it!!!  It is amazing!!! I am so happy I purchased it!
141659521X|4.0|I have read all of the books in the Mitch Rapp series. The Last Man is a definite improvement over the two previous ones. I hope that this is an indication that Mr. Flynn's health is greatly improved. I believe that this is the only story to take place entirely on foreign soil except for a smalll portion devoted to corrupt Washington politicians. Although this is a work of fiction, it doesn't take much imagination to connect fictious actions to actual Washington activities. Mitch Rapp's character represents a highly efficient operative against terrorism and presents a realistic picture of  problems facing America today. It should be required reading for everyone in the intelligence community. Events move at a rapid pace and it is a book that I could read in one sitting, time permitting. I would like to see a little less use of four letter words. There are many other words that are just as effective and would convey a similar meaning. Mitch Rapp's vocabulary should not be so limited.  I hope that there will  be more of Mitch Rapp in the future.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I liked this book, it kept me smiling and wanting to read more. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|If you love Van Morrison; this is a must!<br />Don't pass this by..<br />Add it to your collection of all the others you<br />have.
B0054VVRBQ|4.0|After reading all the reviews I figured I would be ok since I was running Snow Leopard (10.6.8) on my Macbook Pro (2007).  I downloaded and installed the drivers first from Transcend and then restarted like instructed.  I installed the Transcend card reader and nothing. I tried a few restarts and and the removal and installation of the card and stil nothing. I even uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers and still nothing.  Finally I installed the drivers with the card installed in the slot and now its working.  From what I've read from other reviews not one installation procedure seems to work for all so don't give up.<br /><br />Now on the card itself, I like that it sits flush and even that the SD card sits flush as well when installed in the reader.  Bought it to transfer all my pics shot with the DSLR. Speeds are fast, faster than the camera with the USB cable.<br /><br />Good luck with the install
0762777931|5.0|This book is a joy to read with every line and turn of the page. Healthy and informative advice for not just diet but lifestyle.
B007HOOAH6|5.0|Great Grandson has me read this over and over.  He is jut learning to use his potty chair and loves that some one else is too.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I started to get bored.  Started book three and am totally bored with the characters and plot.  I can't imagine this series as a movie.
1451695195|5.0|Easily finished in 2 days; inspiring story, even if you're non-believer.  Must-read for believers as it will sustain and bolster your faith.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is writen in a beautifully simple, yet confusing manner. Keeping you on the edge of your seat until the end, it's an easy five stars.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I became a fan after reading the first book.  I cannot wait for all the movies.  Great book and easy and interesting reading.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This is a great book about a woman daring to defy her circumstances and history. I avoided reading it because I thought it was another \\"woe is me\\" journal. It's not. Well written, engaging and inspiring; I thoroughly enjoyed it.
030758836X|2.0|It was predictably bad after reading the first few chapters and thoroughly depressing the rest of the way.  I feel as maniacal as the characters for forcing myself to finish it.  Nothing redeeming about any of them.  The author should have let Nick be a hero instead of a chump.  Disappointing after all the positive reviews.
B0093FNZT6|5.0|Why should I read this book? It's not that it's all that well-written, it's good but what it delivers is the feeling of what he's going through. It's a moving book for me, it makes me feel deeply and not many books do that. I find his viewpoint fascinating, exhilarating and stupendous, it's almost like it's my story too - most unusual. Is it your story too?
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is a well designed puzzle game with very good graphics and simple to play. I had no trouble playing on my Kindle Fire, but it is not one of the new, larger models where others have reported problems. This is only the second game I have played on the Kindle so I can't compare it to other games.<br /><br />I didn't expect much for $1 and was amazed with the overall quality and the graphics in particular. Like most puzzle games, there is a bit of navigating back and forth but the touch screen navigation worked smoothly. The puzzles, while not too difficult, are clever and fairly logical. If you enjoy playing puzzle games then you should like this one.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I watched this not really expecting to like it. I'm a Bruce Willis fan in the Die Hard genre and this is very different for him but he is wonderful as the almost bumbling cop. The movie works I think because of the stellar cast and yet none of them steal the show. That role is taken by the young stars. A really charming movie. I loved it
B005NJU8PA|4.0|I found this an informative and entertaining book with surprising ideas and facts that I had not anticipated.<br /><br />As Ferris states this is not a cook book but a book about how-to-cook with principles which can be applied in a myriad of other fields.  There are few people I can imagine who couldn't gain something from reading this.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Mark Greaney does not need Tom Clancy. Tom Clancy does need Mark Greaney.  This is a review of Mark Greaney's Threat Vector. Tom Clancy forgot what a keyboard looks like by now and the natural selection law dictated that a new talented writer had to be found. Like I said, Mark does not need Tom.<br /><br />Mark took the readers by surprise in an airborne infantry assault fashion - full frontal -  in his Grey Man series. Those who love to read immediately recognized the talent and the meticulously researched details in his work which were neither superfluous and overbearing ala vintage Clancy (Sum of All Fears comes to mind where I had to skip pages to follow the story line) nor simplistic and basic. Mark's approach to presenting details essential in a technothriller is just right.<br /><br />The story of Threat Vector flows in a very fluid and logically perfect pattern without unnecessary cliff hangers at the end of a chapter where your heart rate would go up only to drop you into a cooling bath in the next where the story would switch to some irrelevant and secondary character or event urging you to skip pages wondering what the crap was the writer smoking and leading you to believe the chapters must've been switched out of order upon publication. That would be vintage Clancy. Nothing like it exists in Greaney's work. The plot idea of the Threat Vector is not unique but is very plausible and relevant to the geopolitics of 2012. You'd have to read it yourselves to appreciate it.<br /><br />I am looking forward  to more of Mark's work.
B005USZML4|4.0|My son chose this book as his independent reading book for middle  school.  He really enjoyed it. Highly recommend students to read,
B009FZHYKU|5.0|excellent story line, well rounded characters....nonstop drama and action<br />I recommend this on going drama to everyone.. two thumbs way up.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great calculator for kindle fire! everything looks nice and runs fast. I love the large buttons, sooooooo easy to use! app downloaded in less then 30 seconds.<br />Great app!
B008NQYWC0|5.0|I read the book (my first Stephen King book) and loved the story and the approach to how the story was told. This purchase was for a Christmas gift.
B00A5052YE|5.0|I love every song on this CD.  Love the musical chemistry between Alicia and Maxwell on Fire We Make.  Listen to your Heart is a good upbeat song when driving around town; makes me want to dance while driving.  And of course, I'd been looking forward to Girl On Fire every since the Citibank commercial.  Finally, I look forward to all of Alicia's CDs to see what classical tune she'll use for the Intro.  She is such a talented young lady.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|15 songs?  The whole \\"more bang-for-you-buck\\" trend started in the mid-late 80s,<br />and more often than not hurt an album more than helped.  Leads to \\"filler\\" and re-<br />petitive, extraneous material.<br /><br />Not sure whether to blame the band, producer or combination of.  But the lack of<br />editing is certainly Music From Another Dimension's biggest problem.<br /><br />The record starts off very strong: \\"Luv XXX\\" is Aerosmith's best opening track since<br />Permanent Vacation's \\"Heart's Done Time\\".  The Stonesy \\"Oh Yeah\\" rocks.  \\"Street<br />Jesus\\" is probably the best of the bunch.  And closer \\"Another Last Goodbye\\"<br />reminds of all-time classic \\"You See Me Crying\\" and the underrated \\"Mia\\".<br /><br />Unfortunately, this gets lost in the translation due to the likes of \\"What Could Be<br />Love\\", \\"Can't Stop Lovin' You\\" (featuring Carrie Underwood: really Steven?) and<br />Joe Perry's plodding \\"Freedom Fighter\\".<br /><br />I gave MFAD a 4-stars, but it's really closer to 3 and a half.  Cut four songs and<br />Aerosmith could have truly had something special...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I LOVE this game so so so so so so so so much!!!!!!!! Its a challenge on some levels but really really really fun!!!!!! This app is solo great!!!!! This app is a must have!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B00992CF6W|1.0|this game is not worth 6.99 it should be free you cant see the zombies all you do is build its boring!!!!!
B00881VLCE|3.0|I like this but I wish there were more pieces....it would be more challenging...the pictures are nice but there could be an option to use your own pictures from your own gallery.
B00633W614|5.0|Well done....just can't wait for the next installment.  The character development over the course of the first two books in the series is exemplary
1580086810|5.0|After reviewing this, it is no wonder that we have a problem with growing obesity.  Our children think that if they miss a meal they are starving.  Yet so many are lucky to have a meal each day.<br /><br />The excellent pictures in this book illustrate this wonderfully.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|So convenient and easy to use! I am placing Christmas lists on here so boys won't be tempted to find and read paper lists!!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|After listening to 'Standing Ovation' many times my first impression was that Susan was very much at home with this genre. Her passion for these classic songs from the stage is felt in each and every track, as her voice effortlessly reaches notes that stir familiar and touching emotions captured from the original stage productions. Susan has a magnificent voice, but with 'Standing Ovation' I note a new finesse in how Susan uses her voice to capture deep feelings within the song and transfers that back to the listener.  In 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow', an amazing interpretation of this song, Susan gave me new found hope that 'dreams really can come true'. The pathos exhibited here coupled with the range of Susan's voice, and fueled by an outstanding musical arrangement, were nothing short of extraordinary.  I felt the same feelings with 'Memory\\" from 'Cats', and, Susan's duet with Michael Crawford, \\"The Music of he Night\\", a powerful blending of mystery and passion, beautifully executed by Susan. The inclusion on this album of Donny Osmond, Susan's teenage idol, was a surprise to me. But surprises can be fun, and I suspect both artists enjoyed very much there time together in the recording studio, with \\"This is the Moment\\" & \\"All I Ask of You\\" because each compliments the other's style of singing with an affectionate respect and candor.<br /><br />No question in my mind that 'Standing Ovation' will stand the test of time. With outstanding musical arrangement by The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and production mixes by Biff Stannard, this album will evoke feelings within you long forgotten, and re-invoke passions that you would like to get in touch with once again. Well done, Susan Boyle.
B000Y5JFNY|4.0|AMAZING value will make the perfect gift as described can't believe the price I got on this couldn't be happier and hope they like it very pleased
0061992860|5.0|Great book, small and compact. Able to fit in any pocket. Full of good information and informative. Very well written.
0307346617|5.0|this book is riveting and scary.  Not because it's a slasher, or who-done-it... because it's feasible and well researched.<br /><br />A series of &#34;interviews&#34; that form a story, this book is nice for people who have to read in short bursts.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Movie was better than I expected it to be. Thought is yet another remake of the original Snow White, but it had some nice twists to it.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|this is a must read.  I think women will like it better than men..  No - it's not a love story by any means.  It starts out a little confusing because the author goes from present to past every other chapter.  But once I figured out what the author was trying to accomplish, it got really exciting, plus it was a great idea by the author.  Now I know why she did it..  Couldn't wait to find out what happened in the end.  It's a tad violent, ladies.<br />Susie K
B0038P59A0|5.0|Although this movie would make Arthur Conan Doyle spin in his grave (the rebellious, disheveled, impulsive and libertine Sherlock Holmes in the movie is almost the antithesis of the reserved and conservative Sherlock Holmes in Doyle's books), it's a fun action film with a clever plot.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|if your screen is fast and you have good speed in your phone this game plays great and it's fun. I have a dual core Android phone
B0058UXHHK|4.0|I enjoyed this book more than I expected to. I liked it enough that I will read the second one when it comes out. It is a quick and easy read with enough love and adventure to keep it interesting.
B0034G4P80|5.0|This is a great movie a bit short though it sets the mood appropriately for the Avengers. I would have liked to see more development of the supporting actors/actresses but over all it was good.
B009H442DG|5.0|I love the variety of genres and the voices are magnificent!  Also - playful - feels good to listen to.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|We love the way that Mr. Grisham write. It is a pleasure to read and when you start with it, you don't want to stop until you finish.
0783225547|5.0|Bought this movie to show my earth science class. It has accurate detail when it comes to what a volconalogist looks for in eruptions.  Other parts are pretty cheesey.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|It is a well writen book, normally you take inly a couple of days to read. We recommended with hesitation.
B003XJDT1W|5.0|ZBB is great as usual...I'll buy anything by them...wonderful music, good down home stuff with a twist that will keep foot tapping or keep you dancing
B008H6GH8I|5.0|Well worth every penny as part of the RE series. The CGI is excellent and the voice actors are perfect. The storyline is very worth continuing.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|My wife and I were surprised with Jeff Lynne's fresh interpretation to timeless classics, and as one would expect with most if not all of his work, he obviously expended an enormous personal effort to bring these songs into a new light.  We hope he does not stop in this regard, because he has a lot to offer for the enjoyment of all generations.

This is probably my favorite movie & I'm so glad that I finally got it!!<br />I gave it 5 stars for the movie, & also for the seller. This is a movie I will watch over and over again for a very long time!!  I'm just so happy to have it in my favorite DVD collection.;)
B006VREHRS|4.0|Movie was excellent as was the quality.  My family and I enjoyed the film and would more than likely add to it.

B00005JNS0|2.0|The DVD looked like it was in pretty good shape upon original purchase but it skipped a lot in the DVD player. Not a great experience.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I have used this book as a guide to formatting two manuscripts that subsequently were uploaded as Kindle ebooks and found that it solved my problems and made formating and uploading the book easy to accomplish provided the manuscript is a Word document. As clearly stated early in the book, the instructions apply to documents in Word, specifically Word 2010, but, because Word documents in earlier versions are similar enough to the 2010 version to be treated in the same way, the instructions apply to any Word document. Here is what is said in the book about this: \\"Microsoft Word is the most widely used format, and suggestions here are specific to Microsoft Word 2010, though the steps are the same in nearly all versions of Word.

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Loved this book and hte way you can uderstand what people respond to - especially useful when choosing gifts!  Highly recommended.
B000002JBG|5.0|I remember watching this movies as a young kid in theaters way back in 96, I loved the movie and when I first heard the soundtrack to my favorite childhood movie I was amazed that every song of the album made me want to get up dance. Many years later I found the cd again and I played and I still love it and still rock out to it for the nostalgia. I would recommend this soundtrack to anyone who love Space Jam
1451627289|5.0|Frankly, Stephen King's last couple of novels were of questionnable quality. But this hit me hard. Well told story about the nostalgic period of the early 60's. You'll be surprised!
B009FBX5M0|3.0|This should have the Adele song Skyfall on the album.  It would have made this a good CD, needs Adele...
1439156816|4.0|An interesting insight in how Stephen King prefers his fiction. Not everyone will agree, but it's interesting how he hates the passive verbs :-)
B00A31UXLW|3.0|I have read all of Connelly's books and eagerly launched into this one when it arrived. Then it suddenly dawned on me that I have in fact found at least his last five books to be tedious, and this was no exception. Poor old Bosch is in his 60s now - isn't it time to relieve him of the obligatory physically violent climax? Surely a man of his age would be far too damaged after all the injuries he has sustained? I have continued to read this series out of brand loyalty, but I am no longer enjoying it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it reminds of super Mario but it's 3d kind of I looooooooooove the creepers I hate zombies I herd if you kill skeleton you will get a bow and some arrows

B008NB0SQO|5.0|My family loves this movie.  It is so funny and the songs are great.  Gonzo makes a great Charles Dickens and Rizzo makes an amazing side-kick.  I definitely recommend this movie!
B008WCP2PG|4.0|I found this movie entertaining.  The acting and dialogue was grade &#34;B&#34; but Tatum pulled it together with his phenomal talent.  Those moves are tough to duplicate. LOL
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Yes, I know the story is predictable, but that's kind of why I read it. I love a good romance, and I liked this one in particular because they got married after knowing each other less than a day, and didn't sleep together first. It made the story unique and special to me, because in a twisted way, it appeals to my traditional side.<br /><br />Connor and Megan meet in Las Vegas accidentally, and are quickly connected. But what appeals to them both initially is the practicality and stability of the situation - marriage with commitment expectations, family expectations, but no love expectations. Both have their own personal reasons and histories for their heart-ache and trust issues. Seems like a win-win situation, right? Well, not when alcohol and memory loss are involved, hence sending Connor into win-my-wife-over mode.<br /><br />I liked that while Connor was trying to help Megan overcome her fears and past, Connor eventually had to face his own issues and past as well. I liked that they did have a chemistry that I could feel through the pages, and while they were attracted to each other physically, that wasn't their biggest attraction. They liked each other as people and got close emotionally without really meaning to.<br /><br />I was satisfied with the ending and felt like Connor and Megan were able to grow in their own characters and work through their issues without compromising who they were.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Indiana Jones Movies has alway been my favorite Movies.  The Conversion to Blu Ray is Outstanding.  I see and hear things I did not notice on the DvD version.  This Version completely immersed me into the movie more than I usually am.  And I have watched this hundreds of times.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Nice plot but the characters personalities were NOT believable. The heroine was spook whiny you really wanted to smack her in the head. But since this was a free book.....
B000VECAEO|5.0|I'm a real fan of Seinfeld and have been considering the purchase of all of the shows. I'm elated that when I want I can relive the past, it's at my fingertips!!<br /><br />Couldn't be happier!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game! Its so much fun! There are tons of dragons all with their own unique discriptions. You can get more dragons as you level up and evolve your dragons to get more coins. It does require patience and you have to meet friends to be able to expand and get gold. This is very similar to pet shop story and has the same concept except you can breed any dragons for only 200 coins. Its so much fun and you should definitely give it a try!

B004ZZS4CC|2.0|Honestly, my heart goes out to Jaycee and wanted to get a first hand account of her story rather than reading it elsewhere, but the book is horrid. You aren't missing anything if you watch her interviews. I think a lot of reviews are based on her situation and not that of her writing ability. To be totally honest, I was a little outraged by reading about her years of \\"captivity\\" in which she had years to help herself. In fairness I understand she was brainwashed by a dangerous man who was very obviously mentally ill but she is an intelligent woman and to read about countless times she could have helped herself it made me sick and borderline suspicious of parts of the story. As if he could have been her estranged father, family member or if she actually loved him. Even to the point she protected him and his wife over and over, lying to police, parole agents, their neighbors.<br /><br />But this shouldn't be about the situation but the book. Which I skipper over some portions. I think if she may have waited a while longer it may have come together in a much better sequence because a large portion is very vague and while she may be protecting her privacy, it doesn't make this book's claim as being a full chronological order of events. I cant exactly put my finger on it but I'm greatly disappointed with both the writing and the price of this book.
B00138H1MS|4.0|There's a smaller percentage of people alive who listened to Elvis during his peak popularity so I guess the sales are falling off by now.  We bought this for the nostalgia of it.  The recordings are very clear considering that the original source had to be old reel to reel magnetic tape, not as flat sounding as some of the pre 1970's music.

B0057UAE54|5.0|For once, the audience actually enhances the experience of this magnificent &#34;live&#34; album.  &#34;Do you feel like we do&#34; is, to me one of the top ten rock classics of all time where Frampton brings the Talk Box to a new level. Other noteworthy stripes, for starters, on this album are &#34;Lines on my face&#34;, &#34;Show me the way&#34; (Talk Box again), and &#34;Baby, I love your way&#34;. Peter had somewhat mediocre success as measured by some in the business, but not on this Album of the Year, circa 1978. It still kicks.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|I loved the movie, but did they mean to steal the ending from Black Sunday? Is it meant to be an homage to John Frankenheimer?

B008UTV6S8|5.0|I have been a fan of Paul Simon since the 1960's when he teamed with Art Garfunkel. The blend of both these guys voices was phenomenal. Since Paul and Art split Paul has certainly diversified with his music, especially using black African musicians. This DVD/CD set epitomises the transition in his music.
B002NOYX54|5.0|I found the concept, the execution and the performances to be of a very high level of creativity and individuality. I was captivated by the concept...and the editing...and found myself attempting to sing lyrics in languages I don't even know...at some upbeat tempo..for days on end. ..often alone in the car or in the shower.
B005HSL626|5.0|This has been a really fun game for the whole family. My kids love it and so do I. Fun
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I have an eight year old granddaughter who loves the My Little Pony everything.  She found it on my Kindle Fire the last time she came here and gave me a big hug and said she loves, loves, loves it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This new novel is the best one of the Mitch Rapp novels my wife and I have read. We can't wait for the next one.
B0029XFNA8|2.0|I was disappointed in the quality of the video transfer.  Keep the DVD if you have it, and save money.  The movie itself is top rate Christmas fare.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As a non-believer I found this book to be very intriguing and am now reconsidering the possibility of a spiritual being within all of us.  A very good book!
B00270WH3Y|5.0|This is surely not the most comprehensive collection (as has been noted in other reviews), but it's perfectly succinct. This was my introduction to Simon & Garfunkel as a child and I've since acquired more of their work, but this will always be my favorite. It's sort of a perfect little playlist of you will. I've owned the LP, cassette, CD, and now I've downloaded the MP3 album (I wore the CD out!). It's that good.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|If you enjoy science fiction by Robert A. Heinlein,John Scalzi,Allen Steele or John Varley, you'll enjoy this book. I can't praise it too highly. Looking forward to other books by this author.
034580404X|5.0|Mr. Grey!!!!!!!!!  Love it, so happy I decided to go with the trilogy. My friends and I really enjoyed the books, and I love the case.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|When it comes to action scenes, cinematography, sound, music, special effects, choreography, this movie is top of the heap.  I would characterize the action sequences as nothing short of amazing.  However, the story fell a little flat, despite having some seriously good performances by some great actors.  There are just a little too many plot holes and nonsensical things in the story that prevent me from giving it higher marks. For instance, the entire Stock Market scene was just ridiculous.  (I'll leave spoilers out though.)<br />As far as the Blu-Ray is concerned, it's well worth the money.  Fantastic picture.
1451688091|5.0|This book was ordered because of the movie of course and i cant wait to give it to my wife as a Christmas gift.
B007HACDLK|5.0|A great, fun read that moves very rapidly. Mitch Rapp is what most men think of themselves as being. He doesn't disappoint.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app -- has touch-move, great graphics.  Ads don't bother me because when one pops up (which is always just after the deal and before play) I simply touch the screen anywhere, a \\"skip\\" tab pops up, I touch it and I'm on to my game.
B00000DQSF|3.0|This is the album that was made from the pricrtice sessions in the Big Pink House basement tapes. Great for hard core The Band fans.
B00729GQ0A|4.0|Forever Girl was sort of slow in starting, typical paranormal type of romance between young adults. Nothing too great on the love and romance, but the storyline slowly gets more creative and better in the middle end of the book when you discover why the title is &#34;forever girl.&#34;  It got interesting as the book was ending so I picked 4 and not 3.  It was just a 3 at the beginning then became a 4.
B000002552|3.0|This album was made from practice sessions in the Big Pink House of Bob Dylan and The Band. Recorded by Levon and Robbie. Quality is poor but it is souls mucic for the die hard fans. i bought it for a gift to a big Dylan fan,
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is good the only downside is the adds. It is also a game you can give to the kids without worrying about things going wrong.
B000002IQ9|5.0|This is the best Phil Collins solo album there is. I was lucky to see this concet many time when they were touring. The best was the Forum in LA july '90.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have watched the first half of Season 3, and I must say it is really good!! The actors are so awesome!
B00005N6KG|5.0|I bought these for my step daughter to use with an iPod and other electronics. She says she loves them and so far they have held up to the daily abuse she puts them through. Ya Sony!
B005K17RU0|4.0|works fine.  tells me the both the current weather and the forecast.  simple without a bunch of clutter.  functional simple app.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is Adele Adkins second album and her best. I love her. I hope the quality of her future albums lives up to this one.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I got this free with my purchase of the Canon T4i. I was expecting a cheap bag that I would probably not use, but when I received it in the mail, I was shocked. I love this bag. Great design, great quality, and the best part is, I got it for free.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A good taste of the English countryside and its people.  i like human interest stories, more so when I like its setting.
B009K45Y62|5.0|I was afraid that the box would be a really small size but I am so happy it isn't small at all. It look amazing, and I couldn't have asked for a better design for this limited edition Bat Cowl. It is a must buy!
B005VPRG10|5.0|In the spirit of X-mas , I'm giving you a tip !<br /><br />Walmart has this set for $34 !! Amazon is selling it for $59 ?! what a joke.<br /><br />I bought 3 of these sets, one for my son, my brother and me. every collection needs a few TIE fighters and for $34 @ Walmart, its a must buy. Stop reading and buy it...NOW !!
B008RTE09S|1.0|This is probably the worst bluray transfer ever - totally out of focus and lack of sharpness = this dvd should be recalled - do not waste your money.
B004132HZS|5.0|Because I dislike the U.S. show \\"Elementary\\" so much, I nearly missed out on this show.  On a radio recomendation, I bought it, without ever having seen an episode.  It turns out, it is not the putting of Holmes and Watson in the 21st Century that I did not like about \\"Elementary,\\" but the acting, writing and direction in that very inferior show.<br /> Sherlock is the update done right.  It has very good writing, acting and directing.  It was interesting to see how they even improved the very good Pilot in the first episode, lengthened, redo.<br /> While I like a little longer season, when the quality is this high, I cannot complain too much.  I am usually opposed to making major changes to established characters, however, Sherlock does not harm, in any way, the spirit of the original characters. This is good TV!
B004GGQMTW|5.0|The review \\"It's Just A Movie\\". Really? How observant-it is just that a movie. Movies ask us to suspend our disbelief for an hour or two. EVERYTHING doesn't have to be realistic - I get enough of that on the news.<br /><br />Thelma & Louise react how some people MIGHT. Does it make sense the path they took to those of us in the comforts of our seats-not always. But it makes perfect sense to these CHARACTERS in this MOVIE. I guess if you have never been in a surreal experience it is difficult to extrapolate that to put yourself in these characters shoes. You DO NOT think logically or rationally. A large portion of your brain is trying to reconcile what has just happened & potential consequences of such.<br /><br />Louise said it perfectly when she references the events being a \\"snowball effect\\".<br /><br />For those of you not observant, Louise apparently was a rape victim and may have killed her attacker. Thus, it would seem from her viewpoint that the law would find that coincidence improbable & a slick DA & lame jury could lock her away. She may have done time for whatever was eluded to happening in Texas.<br /><br />As for Thelma sleeping with Brad's character-again, some women's psychological reaction to rape is promiscuity. Or she maybe needed to try to take back her power in CHOOSING to have sex with him.<br /><br />This movie is one hell of a ride & obviously one of my favorites. I'm sorry for those of you that miss out on all the subtlties in this gem of a movie. It is a fabulous character study of the wonders of the human psyche.<br /><br />Tip: Louise is VERY anal at the start- buttoned up, starched collar-ish, no dirty dishes left in the sink, tidy, tidy, tidy. Controlled even when she is on vacation (she was awkward & stiff at the bar at first). Oh, what a transformation that occurs for this character.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|What can you say but &#34;FABULESS&#34; movie. We are waiting for the follow up to Avatar. Got to be a great movie.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love the app and its free. Keeps you on top of what the power usage. It's easy and simple to use. A must have for the kindle
B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke is a Miyazaki classic. The film is beautiful, the voiceovers were wonderful, overall this was a great buy.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|I can't explain it, this movie has been my favorite for years and years.  It's not that I'm a Tom Hanks or Shelly Long fan, but something about this movie cracks me up EVERY TIME!<br /><br />My favorite scene of all time that makes me laugh EVERY TIME?  When Tom Hanks gets hysterical laughing when the bathtub falls through the floor.  I laugh as I wrote that and recalled the scene!<br /><br />If you want a light, funny, potentially hilarious movie depending on your sense of humor, buy, rent, whatever, WATCH THIS MOVIE!  But, watch it more than once.  It takes a few times to truly appreciate the beauty of the comedy.<br /><br />That's all I've to say about that.
1401322786|3.0|The characters were well fully developed, yet Sarah and Victor's stories were not that interesting. Dor's story is truly complicated and entertaining. Surely if the Father of time were to pick two soul to save, there must be more adequate souls for saving rather than Sarah and Victor.<br /><br />The book was short as others have noted, it was a one day read. Overall entertaining, but only half of the main characters were well developed.
B002WY65W4|4.0|This is such a great movie. Woody Harrelson is awesome in it. The shipping was great and the product came quickly and in perfect condition.
B009682EFQ|5.0|Best album since Times Of Grace! Though I do love every album of theirs' since Souls At Zero, I've always considered &#34;Souls&#34; through &#34;Times&#34; to be their classic era that is untouchable even by Neurosis themselves. This album's scope of sonic weight and depth join that classic album echelon for me. The pinnacle of their 21st century catalogue. So if you like any Neurosis albums from A Sun That Never Sets and on, you'll love this one. Get it.
B002L9N4DS|5.0|Must have! Great service, shipping and great product. LOVE this movie! If you are a Tom Hanks fan and you haven't seen it, then just buy it! So worth it!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|such a cute game my 5yr old is going to love it to! can't wait to see how the game ends!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story. The first three books are amazing . Its edge of your seat waiting to find out whats going on. Then the reat of the story unfolds.Very good.I enjoyed it.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|First off - my review is for the 3D set of The Avengers.  I want to say that I really I loved the movie - it is a great film and gets 5 stars.  It's a must see film.  There are so many reviews that I'm not going to go into all the details, but to say that they did a really good job with the film, and they allowed all 4 main Characters and the 3 minor ones to shine.  My one complaint about this movie is that this was the first 3D film (and I own about 30 Blu-Ray 3D) that I had ghosting that was through out the entire film.  I have not had this problem with the other films that I've watched.  Sadly, what should have been the star of my 3D home theater system is a movie to enjoy, but not to show off what I have.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|this book is cool.peeta is awesome.snow is bad.you should read the septimus heap novel.black ops two is infinity and beyond. the hungergames is wierd.im finished.
B001VNB54A|3.0|Too much romance, not enough war.  Not as good as Band of Brothers.  They didn't build the characters in the same manner.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I didnt know what I was getting into when I purchased this book because I had heard both good and bad about this book. When I started reading it, it seemed like I was kind of reading about parts of my life. If she wrote any a quarter of this book about her life I'm glad she has finally found peace and joy because she deserves it. I would only recommend this book to mature adults that can understand life. Its not really for young people that havent been through life just yet.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I've read quite a few books on Abraham Lincoln & this will be one of my favorites.  It takes the presidency from a different angle.  A good read!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|WHile this isnt our favorite Pixar film it was up there for sure. The color and graphics are beautiful and the story was cute. They couldve developed it a little better and made a richer plot but over all i left being glad i saw the movie. Id watch it again.
B00129H7VS|5.0|We have watched this 4 or 5 times.  The best war movie Ever!  Loved it that they have the real people who fought the war commenting.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|As a Potter fan, Hallows 2 had everything. Betrayal,  excitement, suspense, levity, tears<br />and finally closure.  Very emotional ride.  I'm glad I took the trip.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I picked this book cause it didn't sound preachy and religious and thank God it wasn't. Although deeply spiritual the author didn't try throwing his own religious nonsense or beliefs in there like so many NDR's seem to do. That is a huge turnoff for me and one that makes me feel that those claiming to have the experience are either coloring it too much with their own beliefs or flat out lying. The author was able to explain much of his experience in a way that I could fully understand and in basic terms. Although he gave us alot of medical background he admits that science alone has no answer for the divine. I highly recommend this book if you aren't looking for someone to shove Jesus or religion or the bible down your throat.
B004LWZW42|5.0|Best of the series.  Chronicling the origins of Xavier, Magneto, Mystique & Beast was brilliant.<br />Very explosive from beginning to end. Eric (Magneto's) quest for revenge is haunting.  If you're<br />An X fan, no disappointment here.
B00006JSS8|4.0|The CD was in perfect shape, and Stevie was, too. This CD has most of the songs I wanted and a very good insert as well.<br />Joe
B004LWZWGK|1.0|This is a pathetically bad movie.  Way too long, a total waste of time and the talent involved, and I don't mean Christian Bale or the director, because they both fail miserably  here.<br /><br />Michael Caine is my favorite actor, and I really hope he just retires before he does any more crap like this.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|I preordered this movie with expectations I would get what I paid for: which was new condition, Blu-ray/DVD and Digital Copy. I received the package the movie case looks like it was ran over. There is no Normal DVD and the digital copy says its expired!! Day late then release date and digital copy already expired!<br /><br />BUYERS BEWARE, no DVD and expired Digital Copy!!!!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy this very much. If I am waiting for someone or something and need to keep my mind off the wait, I pull out my tablet and play flow. In most cases the puzzles last are short and time pasts fast, but then you run into a challege that makes you work. It is hard to stop. Once you finished one puzzle you want to see the next.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|This was a well-written book that asked many questions.  How powerful is heredity?  Can a parent judge a child objectively?  Was it ethical for the father to be involved in the envestigation?  The questions just keep coming.  A very good read.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|my grand-daughter loves all the princes and Cinderella movies.  anything that is girlish.  this keeps her occupied while she is playing with her toys
B0010YSD7M|3.0|SG-1 spent 8 years defeating the Goa'uld and had a couple of years to go so here come the Ori! I always wondered what was going on with that and found this movie to be nothing more than a double length TV episode with a big budget intended to wrap things up.<br />It's &#34;pretty&#34; to look at but I probably won't bother with the Blu-ray edition that was eventually released.
B0006GAOCW|4.0|gOODB STORYM WITHM HUMOUR  AND COMING IOF AGE AND RELIZATYION OF WHAT LOVE IS. AN NEXCELLRNT CAST ANDE WELL CHOSEN FOR A SATORY WITH HUMOUR AND DRAMA
B003L77G2Y|4.0|as time goes by this &#34;wonderfully bizarre&#34; series gets, in some ways, harder to understand  and like.. In the first season I never really understood just what was going on, something about a &#34;pattern&#34; in some series of events culminating in Agent Dunham meeting Walter Bishop's old partner William Bell (played by Leonard Nimoy) in an alternate universe. It's a better looking X Files.<br />Second season looked just as good but may have even raised the weirdness level with more strange, not always connected, cases. It ended with a Fringe team crossing to the other universe where they ended up in a battle with the alternate forces and the alternate Olivia taking &#34;our&#34; Olivia's place.<br />Third season is especially confusing, switching back & forth between universes. It turns out Bell was killed in the battle that trapped Olivia &#34;over there&#34; (she does find her way home). I don't even remember when &#34;our&#34; guys figured out &#34;Olivia&#34; but eventually both universes work together to solve some ancient puzzle involving Peter Bishop restoring the disruption caused by Bell & Walter Bishop's early experiments. The season ends with both Fringe teams in a blended lab together getting ready to heal their universes- and then the mysterious bald men in black, the &#34;Observers&#34;, appear to erase Peter from the timeline, he's served his purpose and no one seems to know he's gone. The cliffhanger, pretty much ignored in fourth season, leaves Peter in some future (?- 2036?) battle zone .
B0014ESMCY|5.0|I love this album; it is so relaxing, and the piano work is (obviously) phenomenal. It can sound very dissonant at times (which drives my husband crazy), but I love it. I have played piano for years, and I listen to this album in awe.
B0017MO10U|4.0|After what I consider to be the mess made with &#34;The Ark of Truth&#34;, the series producers got it right with this one. Big budget, parts of it actually filmed north of the Arctic Circle (for a TV movie!), I thought enough of it to go out and get the Blu-ray edition.<br />The Goa'uld were the &#34;best'' bad guys in the series and the big one (after Ra) was Ba'al, good way to end things with a major character brought back and plenty of plot twists & turns.<br />Do watch the featurettes, that is a real nuclear submarine breaking through the ice- talk about military cooperation.<br />This movie can be said to be some of the &#34;best&#34; of Stargate.
0547884591|5.0|I got this book about a week and a half ago, so far I've used the META section to start to break down SEO and Internet Marketing, after which I'll move on to other topics that interest me. I'm starting the DOM section next week and buying my supplies for the first two weeks this weekend. The recipes are going to be put to good use, I promise ;-). This is a great book about learning to cook no doubt, but the most important part of this book is the first section, META.<br /><br />It breaks down how to become world class at things in a relatively fast period of time. Understand that the difference between the top 5% and the top .5% can be huge, but don't let being THE best get in the way of being really good. I really love this book, and would love to meet Tim one day.<br /><br />Tim if you read this, 4hww and this are changing my life man. Thanks.<br /><br />Bless,<br />Graham Rowe<br />Kingston - Jamaica
B000T9OP7G|3.0|I remember liking this one at the start, it even tied in pretty well with the movies. Lena Headey did a pretty good Sarah Connor and Summer Glau was perfect as the friendly terminator (I think one of the extras on the first or second season DVD sets said the role was written with her in mind.)- too bad the series took so dark a turn in second season.
0399157565|1.0|Cornwell has sunk to the absolute bottom with one more junk plot, junk science, psychodramatic \\"mystery\\" lathered with page after page on her angst-ridden relationships with Benton, Lucy and Marino. An irrelevant, essentially misleading title carries into detailed descriptions of characters and locations and histological tests and food recipes, and lots of just plain old filler---all with no connection whatsoever to the solving the five murders described (including an especially convenient nemesis-removal after the murderer is identified). The murderer is not so much revealed as simply dumped in as a character near the end, with corresponding psychopathology added. Should have thrown this book away after 40 pages.  In fact, shame on me for reading further.
B001C4CI8U|4.0|There's no point in my going over the details, read Amazon's description and some of the more detailed, &#34;better looking&#34; reviews. As some write, you'll need patience in trying to understand this very bizarre series but, especially this first season, you'll get some good stories.<br />The extras are especially worthwhile.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|One of his best. Can't wait to see what happens next. Working my way through his back catalog for all the other books that he has written.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|If you like violence and comedy then watch the Expendables 2, just as funny and outrageous as the first. Take a bunch of washed up action heroes and give them guns and look out. The action is fast and furious. If you are looking for reality, skip this movie as nothing real about it. If you are looking for plausibility, skip this movie but if you want laughs with intense ridiculous action then you might like this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game rocks whoever has not plain this you suck bad and plus you guys<br />are downloading. this right now
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|We've seen every Batman movie and rate this as the best of them all. Just good acting, great action sequences and interesting story line. We could nitpick a few things but overall really liked this movie. If you want 100% plausibility then you won't get it in this movie, some things are not realistic even for a Batman movie but easily overlooked in the context of the movie itself. This is a comic book movie so you need to simply look at it that way, it is fiction!
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I downloaded the free app and within 20 minutes I went back and bought the ad free game for only $1.99. The game itself is fun and fast paced. The bonus is all the different ways you can play. Randomly, with a long distant friend or even with a friend sitting right beside you. They also give you the option to chat while playing or to leave the game and come back to it when you can. You can't go wrong with this app/game.
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|This is the first Amazon order I have been disappointed with. I called customer support because mine disintegrated (fell apart after 3 years - I thought it was dangerous).  They said I would have to order a new one. So I unhappily did - then it took 3 weeks to get it!  Very sad. I am disappointed that as a good kindle customer (and convinced 5 family members to get kindles) that this was the service I got.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|News feed is also not working on my second generation kindle fire...I expect better from Facebook.  I hope they fix it soon
B009JBZH54|5.0|Now this is how you do a box set.<br />Not cheaply done with disc in cardboard sleeves.<br /><br />For $30 you actually feel like your getting one over on WB.<br /><br />The picture quality is pretty spot on. Nice Nice Nice HD Picture. But that may vary considering everyone don't have the same HD TV.<br />Sound is Breath Taking.<br /><br />The Extras just add to the mix of hours of entertainment.<br /><br />At under $30 I bought 2 sets. To Introduce someone else to the world of Batman.<br /><br />May be awhile before another trilogy set of movies portray the one we know As Bruce Wayne/Batman.
B00633W614|5.0|His books are never disappointing. You know exactly what you are going to get at the end. I love his writing. Kane And Abel my favorite
0446580848|4.0|As a huge DeMille fan, I anxiously awaited this book. The theme sounded interesting, and I do like John Corey. One of my favorite novels of all time is Up Country, a DeMille novel featuring Paul Brenner, who had a prominent role in The panther. I loved Up Country because I felt that I was in Vietnam, seeing the sights, smelling the odors, feeling the environment. To a lesser degree, I felt similar senses emerge relative to Yemen. It appears the author chose wisely not to visit, but to research. The theme was excellent, although after reading two \\"The Lion\\" novels, \\"The Panther\\" was a bit redundant. Bu that was easy to overcome. I found, as I had in the last one or two novels starring Corey, that his wisecracks were a bit too overdone. To the extent that this book was a learning experience, his constant responses were sometimes unwelcome. His wife told hi to shut the f__k up once. taking the words right out of my mouth. Of course, Cory himself describes this as a tactic to disarm the enemy. As some readers pointed out, there was little action for 500 pages, but that didn't make this less of a great read.I enjoyed it, and look forward to Corey, Mayfield and Brenner meeting up with Buck and Chet!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I don't watch much TV, but my husband was watching it one night and I sat down to be with him.  Well, I am HOOKED on this series.  I now own season 1, season 2 and have pre-ordered season 3.  The action is taut and thrilling and the interactions of the characters just grows on you, the acting is so real you almost think it's really happening.  I would recommend this to any \\"horror\\" story lover.
0761169253|3.0|Very kitschy and lacking in content. I was looking for good information and inspirational insight. I got neither and  wish I had bought something of substance
B002NHGG92|4.0|I am enjoying this series.  The dark, brooding vampire seems a bit like Edward (Twilight) but I still like the characters and as Elena can actually act I like it better than Twilight.
B009YG2ND8|4.0|if the price goes down im sure people would get the game, and besides, its of an infinite quantity since everyone is just getting a copy and it takes very little to produce more copies. Please Square!
B002HFP0R4|5.0|Bought it for my mom. BIG BEEGEES FAN! Great part is some of these songs are either never released or hard to find. I think a few songs are even covers from other artists and she likes that. If you are a Beegees fan, then this is for you,
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I don't consider myself a huge fan of the Batman flicks, but I know what I like, and I loved TDK. What I loved most about it was that the threat posed by Joker wasn't that of your standard movie bad guy. His actions were more cerebral; less about the physical carnage he could inflict and more about the psychological impact that resulted. It came down to high concepts and those characters who embodied them. I expected something as grand as that in TDKR but it didn't quite get there for me. Things like the stereotypical (and under-developed) police chief gunning for the glory of taking down Batman, a clean energy technology being turned into a bomb, and then stopping that bomb from blowing just felt formulaic. Not that it wasn't executed well, or that watching Batman and Bane duke it out was lame (it was great), it just felt a bit less inspired that I had hoped.

159562015X|1.0|A dear friend convinced me to purchase this book, as she thought that I needed to assess/leverage my strengths in our new, albeit anemic job market.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of the self-help book genre, but decided to try it based on her recommendation. And I quickly discovered that:<br />- It is indeed a self-help book.<br />- Containing thin, hollow rhetoric.<br />- Book is only a lead up to an online personalty quiz.<br />- Both the book and the quiz are vague, and unscientific.<br />- Primarily targeted for people who crave self-help instruction.<br />- The kind of thing that human resource department personnel waste time and money on to justify their existence.<br />- Purely a gimmick.<br /><br />Summary of book contents:<br />- Brief, light analogies and anecdotal dreck.<br />- Redundant prattle concerning strength, talent weakness, talent themes and so on.<br />- A code sealed in an envelope allowing access to an online, self evaluation quiz.<br /><br />To conclude, this may be appealing as a game/exercise for a child, but as an adult you should know what your strengths, talents, weaknesses are, and how to manage them.<br />This book and the online quiz isn't going to help you unless you are gullible enough to subscribe to hokum and gimmicks.<br /><br />Tom Rath is a slick salesman who offers a pretty package, marketed to the naive.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|Are you kidding!?! This is probably the best show of all time. There is the perfect mixture of drama and comedy. The chemistry between Bones and Booth is great. This is a stellar show!
B003E2UQMS|4.0|I know nothing about American football or who the Eagles are, but found this story about a man trying to recover after a bout of emotional illness that left him hospitalized and struggling to hang on to his delusions highly engaging.  It has been marketed as a romantic comedy I think, and it's really not.  It's much more a journal of his recovery, and how different relationships - with his parents, his brother and sister-in-law and their child, his therapist and his friends, and another emotionally fragile woman - help him along the way. His voice is authentic and his efforts to integrate his reality are touching.  Nice one.
B005DJREJS|5.0|This is a great show! So awkwardly perfect! Season 1 is a keeper!<br /><br />If you think you might wanna try it, go for it!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Only gives you 16 free credits a day, constantly freezes, especially when you win! Waste of time and $!<br />Rules are difficult to find out as well.
B006LSZECO|5.0|One messed up book! I didn't expect it to be what it is and it was wonderful...funny, surprising, unbelievable, sad, and unbalanced!
0767802519|3.0|I liked the movie but then I like action, thriller type movies.  I don't pay attention to a lot of stuff that some do. I watch a movie to enjoy it, not pick it apart.  I am sure there are parts that could be better and acting that could be better so giving it 3 stars.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|don't try and entice me to buy coins...my fingers are quick to delete games. and try something else snooze you. lose
B005J6LKVI|5.0|Good movie from the book.  Has a good message, presented by very good actors.  Well directed and seems to be well based on historical how it truly was.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I wish I'd kept the paperback. Good enough to buy again. Classic Reacher. Before he seemed to get so hard and angry.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great game. It gets harder as you go, but is fun and challenging. Don't try to buy all the games in order, read the description before you waste your points on a game you won't enjoy
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I haven't been as happy over an incredibly hyped movie as I was with Avengers. It delivers the goods that you expect to see from an action film. It's really the first of its kind in that after watching all the other superhero movies and having their subtle scenes to link each other together, that these (certain) Marvel movie heroes are brought together in one film. It's like getting all the superheroes under one roof for the same price.<br /><br />The reason I say its (so far) the best superhero movie, is simply because out of all the awesome superhero movies made... this one *feels* like a comic book come to life. Don't get me wrong, The Dark Knight trilogy is spectacular in its own right (and Batman is my favorite character), but we get something else with Avengers. Its action packed and filled with thrills, and each film connecting together pays off.<br /><br />Visuals are some of the best on blu-ray. The transfer is incredible and top notch with bright pops, nice color, and deep black (the beginning of the film however is a bit crushing in black detail). I normally like my movies to be presented with their original aspect ratio. In the theaters Avengers was shown as 1.85:1 and instead we get 1.78:1, but that just means the content fits a 16:9 hdtv without tiny black bars. Have a surround sound system? Make the neighbors think a movie theater, or the action is actually happening outside their doors. Experiencing the surround sound is worth a knock to turn it down at theater levels!<br /><br />Avengers is a must own in any movie watchers collections. It has to be my most re-watched movie in the entire bunch.
B00A2H9OG2|5.0|Saw the moovie and all i can say its an awsome moovie.. Cant wait till it comes out on Blu Ray. Based on a true story Excellent. A must see esp if your a beach/surfer person
B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|I adore Kelly - she's real, she puts her heart and soul into each song - this is a GREAT album.  In fact, it's playing as I write this review!
B0073LWEXK|3.0|The Lost City was a good game.  The visuals are nicely designed and the game puzzles are easy to solve.  The game is sort of escape from dungeon where you wake up and have to solve puzzles, explore rooms and interact with stuff to escape.  Given that it was free, I'd recommend this game to try once.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn has done it again.  The Last Man is one of his best works.  Intense, exciting and an all night read.  You'll love it and continue to love Mitch Rapp.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book reminded me of Grisham s earlier books!  It was a page turner and had me up reading till the very end. I would recommend it!  Although, I thought the ending was a little disappointing I really liked it!
B001OGWY1W|4.0|The life of the &#34;caped crusader&#34; can be so complex that hard decisions must be made. Might he consider passing on the crime fighting task to others?
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's so maddening the way they hang there. You think it's going to fall and it just sits there. The coins go fast as does the time. Try not yo go crazy getting them to drop. Before you know it you'll be staring at your tablet forgetting to eat dinner. Good luck.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I beat it in an afternoon, it's really hard to put down! Loved the story, and the scenes were beautifully illustrated.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I'll admidt the games seem rather kiddie, but they are strangely addictive. Add the need to earn coins to unlock new games, and you have a good way to pass time.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|Starts off slow, but appreciate this--  it lets you learn the controls before it gets crazy busy!  Any Hello Kitty fan will enjoy this game!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. It's one of the best purchases I've ever made for a book!<br />Definitely recommend this for war-fantasy lovers. I think this is very underrated, but you can see the few people who read this (compared to other famous novels) would normally give this no less than a 4 star
0345803493|4.0|I read all three books, The story kept you going. What a lifestyle, not mine, but I read all three books. I liked the story. Can't wait to see how they make this movie. It was very repetative, yes. I would get mad at Ana all the time. Her blushing, oh for god's sakes, grown up. I am glad I read these books. Don't know why, but as it progressed it got better for me. That was just their way of life, or his, and then he interduced her to it. Oh well. Hey, who am I to judge.  Good Book... Patti
B009KS4XRO|4.0|won't give credit for multiple BINGO's. something happened to<br />the<br />connection.  afraid if I do the upgrade I will loose everything
098555780X|5.0|Awesome book showcasing some amazing knots and project ideas! I can't get enough of it and have received many compliments on the projects I have completed.
B004EPZ0BG|1.0|I watched over an hour of this and it did not hold my attention. I wasted my money on this.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Another Stewart cd to add to my collection. I have been collecting Rod Stewart albums since 1968. Love this mans voice. I really am not a fan of Christmas music but I love listening to this cd.
B0041B785Y|5.0|One doesn't listen to Meshuggah for subtlety.  Meshuggah's sound is as uniquely punishing as any in metal.  An absolutely inorganic wall of sound, a clinical exercise in symphonic destruction.  Whether you're seeing them live or listening in headphones alone, you're likely to feel like at any moment the next riff might physically crush you against the nearest wall.  If you were to describe their sound to me - cold, robotic, stark and angry - I doubt I'd be interested.  But I became, and remained, a fan - for over a decade now - because they do what they do so, so well.  And their imitators simply cannot compare.  Meshuggah invented this polyrhythmic insanity and they're going to beat it to death for their entire career.  Fine with me.<br /><br />When I first got into Meshuggah, I was obsessed with the album Chaosphere.  The intricate brutality of it took me to a new place - I wasn't even aware something like that could exist, much less that there was a band that had made numerous records honing this totally alien brand of heavy metal.  Now, as a seasoned Meshuggah fan, my tastes have changed a little bit.  I'm now interested in spicing up the headbanging precision with more splashes of groove.  Enter Koloss, with its handful of Pantera-esque mechanical swing factories like standout track \\"Do Not Look Down.\\"  I'm not sure if it's their best record, but it sure is their catchiest and grooviest.  And many of the riffs do not sound like just another awesome Meshuggah exercise in weird timing of repetitive notes.  The riffs on this record snake in and out, bob and weave, and double back again on themselves to create some of the coolest passages in Meshuggah history.  It is exactly the Meshuggah record I wanted - it's something new, but hey, it's still the off-tempo, mad as hell rage of Meshuggah.  And that something new is a further injection of groove into the proceedings.  Thomas Haake pushes the needle farther in than ever before with his drumming on this album, making this the easiest Meshuggah record with which to headbang.  It's less experimental than Catch Thirty-Three and Obzen, but more fun overall (also, while groovy, it is not slow and syrupy like many of the tracks on Nothing).  None of this is meant to imply that Koloss is anything but a mad asylum of disturbing riffage - 90% of people would probably consider it completely unmusical.  It's still crazy, thrashing, outrageous and threatening - still Meshuggah.<br /><br />Jens Kidman remains the same voice of utter insanity in the front.  I have no idea what's he's howling but I'm sure it has to do with computers, robots, nihilism, strobe lights and death.  The production on this record is its only drawback - the compression and loudness sort of ruined the possibility of rich dynamism, but, oh well, Meshuggah isn't really known for dynamics as much as they are known for hammering your face repeatedly with titanic riffage at maximum volume.  I got the CD version - the perfect format in which to listen to cyborg extraterrestrial metal.  Vinyl, the most human, organic, rich format - seems wrong.  The cold calculations of Meshuggah are best enjoyed on a shiny disc.
1596177373|5.0|When I ordered these cards I thought they were Nightmare Before Christmas. I was a bit surprised when I got them. They are very cute and I love them. I am a big Tim Burton fan so I was still happy with them.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|It's hard to write a movie review without spoiling the plot, but basically this movie didn't live up to my expectations.  I had no idea from the previews that this movie centered around her relationship with her mother.  I don't see how young kids could relate.

030758836X|5.0|It was one of the few books I read this year that I couldn't put down.  Such a suspensful writer from begining to end.  And I liked the end.  I send it on to a friend for her pleasure.  MMV
0547569653|5.0|Great story and an interesting journey into the world of endurance.  I wish there was a little more about his relationships along the way and a little more closure with his best friend.  Fun read.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Im not much of one to write a review, but I did enjoy this movie. For once the misses got a good laugh and was pleased. Wouldn't mind a sequel.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|Plays great on my Toshiba Thrive.  Controls are responsive and the ball play is realistic.  The graphics are detailed and the game plays smoothly.

B000FC2L1E|5.0|Loved the series.  Continues in Good form and much preferrable to lugging a 700+ page book!  Kindle is the only way.  Outlander Series on my wishlist 7 books for $50...woot woot!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are one-of-a-kind. I don't think there is anyone else out there mashing up classical pieces with teen pop favorites, and in such a beautiful, clever way. I think this music reaches all ages, from hip teens to even hipper 60 somethings. And the YouTube videos that go with this music are knockouts. The landscapes from the red rock of southern Utah for the African version of Paradise (Peponi) to the northern granite mountains covered with pine and aspen for the Hobbit mash up and other pieces - well they are stunning. I love the movie themes such as the Bourne identity intensity to the Wizard of Oz Somewhere Over the Rainbow mash up. And now, O Come Emmanuel filmed at Goshen, Utah on a mock- Jerusalem set built and used by the Mormon Church for their moving bible videos have mixed videos with Piano Guys rendition of this Christmas Gregorian Chant. Wow, it brings one to tears. Here's the link to see it. [...]  These guys are really hot. This was money WELL spent!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|to the person that said about the error, that's not an error. you cannot divide 0 by anything. that would be like dividing 0 by 4. it would not make any sense.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Well, I love Mitch Rapp. He is everybody's answer to taking out revenge against bad guys. And we love him for being such a patriot and cleaning the world of the scum. But ... I think I'm done with this series. I'm not comfortable with the language, but even more so, with the idea that we are supposed to feel great that our hero can kill with such precision, abandon, and perfection. Evidently, he only had one time when he did NOT take the kill shot to the forehead, and that was when he spared Gould's life, even after that assassin killed Rapp's wife and child. So there is a glimmer of hope, kindness, and charity deep inside. It just isn't who he really is. And I'm sad for it. I think the intrigue of the counterspy, mastermind set-up is fun, and kept me reading even until the early morning hours. BUT ... I guess I've outgrown this genre. I just can't find it too fun to contemplate what is really happening to our hero. Is he really any different from the common assassin? Not really. We and he can try to justify this killing with one argument or another, but it doesn't really work. I guess I just don't want to fill my mind with scenes of torture, agony, scheming, and eventually murder. CAN YOU BLAME ME? I think I'll look elsewhere. Maybe back to Penmann's historical fiction pieces. Darn it! Goodbye Mitch Rapp!
B00024I2Z4|5.0|great story: inspiring, light, and funny:) recommend if you have daughters because it is about being yourself, and honoring yourself when expectations are different for girls vs boys. its shows that being oneself isnt about selfishness or disobeying elders. great for parents to see to ;&#62;
B001DPHDCY|5.0|THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE AT A GREAT PRICE IM VERY HAPPY SO WILL MY SON BE AT CHRISTMAS WHEN HE SEES HIS GIFT
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I bought this book two years ago this month, but did not read it until this past week.  I did see the movie earlier this year and worried about reading the book after seeing the movie.  Usually I try to read and then do the movie second to the reading.  In this case, however, the movie is faithful to the book and both movie and book are superb.  I loved the child, Sarah Starzynski, I wanted good things for her, I was horrified that bad things happened to Sarah and her family.  I want to know more about the Vélodrome d'Hiver roundups and am always pleased when fiction is so well written that it encourages me to dig through history books.  I recommend this book and the movie ( http://www.amazon.com/Sarahs-Key-Kristin-Scott-Thomas/dp/B004UXUUDA/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1354810533&sr=1-1&keywords=sarah%27s+key ) to you.
B008476HBM|5.0|Hadn't read this book in years and couldn't put it down just like last time. Very happy to have found it for free and didn't find any errors or differences that would make me believe it was different.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This guy has the scientific creds. to make the case for. Try to punch holes in his arguement! Heaven is not a theory, it is a fact!!!!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A phenomenal book showing the courage, strength and struggles of one of our elite fighting members.  It also shows the compassion and loving side of a son, husband and father.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is a real tear jerker and the authors medical perspective of his experience is what got me! This book made me feel aware again!
0811879542|4.0|I love this book and think it's SO cute.  My son however, eh - he doesn't think it's all that interesting.  The novelty of it all I think is taken away because of the apps on my phone. If you've read this book, it kinda behaves like an app. Instead, it's a book. So it dawned on me that I love it because it's NOT an app and I was surprised each time I turned the page. For my son, I think he enjoys apps a little more. LOL.
B005LAJ212|5.0|From the beginning, I was hooked. This is the most addictive show on TV and one of the best in years.
B004J4WN0I|3.0|This is the first book in the Iron Druid Chronicles and I would say its shaping up to be a wonderful Fantasy Fiction series. I would say there is not a lot of character development, but the action and the twists and turns in the plot more than make up for it in this readers opinion.<br /><br />Atticus O'Sullivan, a seemingly college-aged man running an occult book store, is really a 2100 year old druid; the last druid to be exact. Atticus, being a druid and deriving his powers from the tattoos on his body connecting him to the earth, hasn't had an affinity for witches since his friend was killed by one early in his life.<br /><br />Atticus he has been chased by the god of love - Aenghus Óg. Aenghus wants a sword that he claims Atticus stole sometime around 150 A.D. Since this time Atticus has been chased by different creatures ranging from Faeries to Demons, each unsuccessful in their attempts to kill him and retrieve the fabled sword Fragarach, `the Answerer'. The latest attempt by 5 Fae happened outside his shop.<br /><br />After learning from the Gods (yes they are real.... ALL of them) that he has once again been found and Aenghus is on his way, Atticus decides 2000 years of running has been enough. Enlisting the help of his Lawyers, the werewolf and the vampire, Atticus makes a plan to finally rid himself of the god of love; however in doing so he also unwittingly enters into a pact with the local witch coven.<br /><br />Nothing goes to plan, as usual, and his wolf lawyer and his faithful Wolfhound Oberon are kidnapped by the head witch and held for ransom, only to be exchanged for the sword. The queen of the Druidic gods and the queen of the hunt each visit Atticus in turn promising him assistance and gifts to defeat Aenghus.  In his travels around town setting things in motion, he gets an offer from a witch with split personalities, one a long dead Indian witch, the other a young girl anxious to become an apprentice Druid.<br /><br />The book is full of action, cover to cover and twists and turns in the plot keeps the story extremely interesting. You will have to read to find out if Atticus' plans work or if the god of love will finally get his revenge. However the best laid plans of Druids never take into account the deceit cloaked in the honeyed words of beautiful goddesses.<br /><br />My biggest question at the end of this magical tale still remains unanswered. How soon can I make it to the store to purchase Hexed, the second volume in the Iron Druid Chronicles?
B00006AUIG|3.0|In my opinion, there are two main reasons why this film is worth your time:<br />1. Some great interior and exterior shots of the Danvers State Hospital, a remarkable (and remarkably creepy) piece of architecture which unfortunately no longer exists.<br />2. The session tapes themselves, within the film, were some of the creepiest things I've heard in years. Really, really well-done scripting and voice-acting on those.<br /><br />Other than that, the movie is really nothing to rave about in my opinion. While it's not terrible, it's certainly not great either. Nothing really terrified me in this movie, and I often had the feeling that given the setting, I should have been a bit more creeped out than I was. The characters are not that well drawn out, the script gets a little tedious at times, and the ending is a bit underwhelming as well. I've heard comparisons between this movie and The Shining, and while I can see the parallels in terms of the setting (large, empty, creepy building) and even in other elements of the movie, The Shining remains leagues above Session 9 in my opinion. I would recommend watching this movie once for reasons mentioned above, but I certainly wouldn't consider it one of my favorite horror movies.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I love the book, the characters really stay with you.  It made me reflect on myself and others.  You never really know what is going on in others lives.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I watched this movie at the theater and loved it.  Had to add to my collection!  Glad I bought it.
B0017P520U|2.0|I had to watch this for extra credit and oh goodness gracious it was horrible. If you read Beowulf. This won't be anything like it, they should've at least changed the title to this movie. Barely any parts were watchable. Some Grendel parts were a bit scary, like less than an inch but that's it. The best word to describe it is ridiculous. Only a decapitated fish would enjoy this. It was incredibly cheesy: the character portrayals , the music, the somewhat good animation but what kills it most is the murder of the actual story line, oh it was just horrible!
B0087YYHZU|5.0|I love musicals and Gene Kelly.  So I had to to have this now that its in blu-ray.  Glad I bought it
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm an avid Walking Dead fan. I'm so glad that there is finally a series for people that love the horror genre.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|You know what makes MIB great is it's whimsical approach to the sci-fi genre. It doesn't take itself to seriously, but it still has a great story line and lovable, approachable characters. This film seems to have lost all of those elements in an attempt to churn out another money making film for the franchise. But what else is new? Disappointing.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|I love the ability to purchase the replacement earbuds for my Plantronics Pro.  I love the headset, but the ear bud broke.  I'm thrilled i can buy replacements!  I got the small.  The existing one came out by pushing in and twisting, then reversed for the new one.  Love that Plantronics thinks of this!  When my Plantronics Pro finally fails (I've had mine for quite a few years now), I'll gladly purchase another Plantronics product.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I gave this to my daughter for Christmas as she was home for Thanksgiving and we did it early and she loved it...It came fast and it was better than expected with the case and dvds! Love it and reccommend it!!
B008OJ291W|5.0|Even though this is re-recorded material, it is great to see Jeff Lynne still producing.  It is interesting to compare this work with the original recordings and to know that he is still very capable singing, playing, and recording great sounding songs.  I also bought Long Wave at the same time as Mr. Blue Sky.  I was not an ELO fan when they were in their heyday, but the songs of ELO and Jeff Lynne occupy a large section of my playlist today.  I am hopeful that he will keep recording, whether it is songs other people have written or, better yet, his own tunes.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|great game. Never got dull. There were a few spots where I had some trouble tapping on an item and the end ofnthe game was kind of choppy but other than that it was fun.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Hey!  It's vince Flynn, one of the very best writers, and my favorite.  His Mitch Rapp never fails to provide page turning delight.
B009EANE3M|5.0|I have loved this band since the first time I heard &#34;Man Who Can't Be Moved.&#34;  What a voice!!!  This CD is quite different from their first two.  There is much more rapping and even though I generally don't enjoy rap music I love this CD.  You can always count on this band to tackle a social issue in a very up front way.  I love it!!!!  I wasn't particularly impressed with two of the bonus songs but I love the CD anyway!!!!
B009I0QTF8|5.0|if you've heard cosmogramma, you probably won't find it too hard to believe that this album isn't necessarily as good. but it doesn't really mean a lot to say &#34;not better than cosmogramma&#34;.<br /><br />5/5 in general<br />4/5 compared to previous albums
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|the beginning is boring and it doesnt even explain the backround of the movie, to tell you the truth, i fell asleep watching this movie and that says alot cause im a big movie fanatic, dont know whats all the hoopla over this movie
B000QFQE4U|4.0|This ls a lengthy piece of work, but well worth watching, not only for Denzel Washington's remarkable central performance, but for the points it makes about the African-American's status in American society. Malcolm X grows up in a violent world, and dies a victim of that world.  In between he manages to preach a message of integrity and self-determination that it as important today as it was when he first delivered it way back in the late 50s and early 60s.  Spike Lee's direction is controlled yet includes some remarkable moments - especially in the moments leading up to Malcolm's assassination, where it seems as if he had a premonition that something dire will to happen to him.  Lee's camera focuses on Washington's face - apparently expressionless, yet full of mixed emotions.  A tremendous effort to tell a story that must be both told and remembered as a significant moment in the history of the African-American.
B002GU5V24|3.0|The music is what it is - incredible.  I know, if so incredible, why three stars?<br /><br />The mix could've been better - it almost seems a copy straight from vinyl without the hiss and pop.  The best example is the lacking of Steve Hackett's brilliant guitar in Seconds Out, just like the album.  Not that I don't like Tony's keyboards, but a nice balance would've been better.  The DVD portion is a little hokey.  Wished there was more live footage.  The extras are good, but watching the tv visuals while listening to the 5.1 remaster is weird.  Computer generated fractals would've been more fun.  The slide show from the Lamb tour was cool.<br /><br />I am not disappointed in purchasing it, I would again.<br /><br />I would not discourage people from buying it, just be prepared to not be blown away like you were with Archive 1.<br /><br />The Music is a Five, but the presentation and not living up to it's potential makes it a 3 star.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This show never ceases to deliver!!!<br />There's never anything to dislike with this show!<br />Anyone who likes Mark Harmon or has seen NCIS before will not be disappointed!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Never thought listening in mono would be so intriguing.  What a remaster.  Never realize how integral Ringo was up the front and center.  The \\"stereo\\" versions I grew up with is a pittance of what stereo became (Thank you Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd), so to hear the Mono versions of the songs I knew really well was enlightening.<br /><br />I'm more apt now to go for the mono version over the stereo version, especially Sgt Pepper(thru my 250w/ch 2channel amp), if you can believe that...<br /><br />I'm so glad I got this one over the stereo remaster...
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this app! I think this app is a great app for kids and including me! This app is very unique and great for creative kids! If you like my review or have a question please contact me at mckenziemiller222@gmail.com. Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy downloading!!!
B004ZNAGNE|5.0|Why did it take so long to release live show?<br /><br />I know you guys hate each other's guts, but why should we who love you guys have to wait over 25 years for this live release?<br /><br />The live version is unbelievable, just wished they didn't leave rest of show on WYWH Experience Version, but got to feed that machine that is The Pink Floyd.<br /><br />Definitely worth purchasing.
B007THA4FI|1.0|The characters are self-absorbed and unsympathetic. Not one is capable of making a smart choice and overcoming adversity.  If you are curious about a world where there is no hope, no happiness, only the shallow joy of feeling superior to other people, you'll like this book.
B000I5X80G|5.0|If you love Neil Young with Crazy Horse, get this disk.  It's Crazy Horse at it's grungiest.  It's short but sweet.  Nice companion to his solo live disk from same recently released collection...<br /><br />Why'd it take so long Neil?  Just as the disc becomes a dying breed...
0547884591|5.0|Another really good effort by Tim Ferris. I have Sauerkraut aging right now as a result of this book. Doing one more thing that I've never done before as a result of another Tim Ferris inspired adventure. The book is really more about the learning process than it is about cooking. Not just learning, but how to hack the learning process. A very worthwhile read.
B008966SIU|5.0|I bought this months ago and I'm still listening to it.  Great band and great album.  I would recommend this album.
B000KFB4PK|5.0|I've gotten more compliments on this watch than on any other watch I own. And not just from a single demographic -- I've gotten comments from businessmen, women in their 20s, children, men who look like criminals, middle-aged women, women with Chanel purses, and hipsters. It's seemingly universally liked. It's a fun, colorful watch, and if it breaks? Hey, it was $14. It had a good run.<br /><br />I've had this for about a year and it's still ticking just fine. It's never let me down. The clasp works fine, most of the time. Sometimes it's come loose for no reason. One of the yellow connecty parts it came with doesn't like to connect so I have to use another color, but that's OK.<br /><br />If you're giving it to a kid, it probably is too flimsy if they're the klutzy, oblivious type. It's more novelty than anything else -- it's not going to be the most durable watch out there. I don't think it'll last a year on a child's wrist. But if they already have so many Legos you can't buy them anymore, they'll probably like this (and I'm betting so will anyone else you buy it for).
B00932A2MC|4.0|Yea its science fiction Had good fx and a pretty good story and kept me watching I liked it. Maybe not for everyone
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book! This book was very exciting and a pleasure to read. I am looking forward to the rest of the story.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|The 3 part story of Barcelona's book-laced history continues,and CRZ does not disappoint.  Loosely based around the Sempere family members the strange connections between the characters from previous books become more apparent . I love this author's writing and his rich, descriptions & character development are masterfully evolved.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This entertaining and thoughtful novel uses the time-honored metaphor of the pilgrimage to explore the modern predicament of dissociation and loss of community.  Walking the highways of Britain might seem an unlikely form of spiritual renewal, but give this readable text a chance.  you will love it!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow! Is all I have to say. It is like nothing I have ever read. Advice when you read this make sure it is NOT in a public area.
159448385X|5.0|This story is well wrtitten and easy to associate with the trials and problems encountered by women in the story.<br />It is easy to follow and hard to put down. It was a history lesson in novel form.<br />Thank you
B0053O89RY|5.0|My daughter in law wanted this for Christmas - I am sure she will enjoy it as she is a big fan of Modern family!
B009FB3WQ4|5.0|Fabulous tribute to the greatest singer of all time!!!! Great to hear recordings by her sung by other artists. Highly recommended.
B00973902K|3.0|Mindless fun catchy tune that the girls wanted me to download. Not bad. It was worth 25 or 50c whatever it was.
1433272466|3.0|If you want someone to argue against Keynes, then this book is for you. I know enough to know that economic stimulus during a recession is considered reasonable by many (but not all) economists.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|love it play as often as I can wish it was easier to get ponies a job.  I do enjoy the ball game.  however the apple game gets stuck if you go to far to one side.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|If your reading this review, your wasting time! You could be watching the walking dead!!!!! Hurry before the Zombies get you!
B00133KFGW|5.0|I so enjoyed this movie. It has a good beginning and ending. Shows how to believe in something and never give up. And it will come to pass. If it is God's will. Very touching movie. I would recommend others to purchase this item. I've watched it over and over.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I bought the 4-Hour Chef because I've discovered the lifehacking movement over the last couple of years. And with the king of the movement, Ferriss, publishing another book, there's no way I was going to pass it up. But I didn't want the book because of the cooking. I wanted it because of his detail on how he goes about learning new skills. I find that to be the most interesting aspect of the 4-hour series (I guess we can call it that now). I was particularly interested in the language learning skills.<br /><br />What I didn't expect was to start cooking. And for someone who's greatest culinary achievement prior to this was grilling hamburgers with onions mixed in (I know, amazing!) the nearly immediate improvement of dinners has been profound. I was nearly sucking on the bone of my first dish I made from the book (Osso Buco). From there, I was hooked. I've cooked about 10 of the dishes and they've all been hits in their own way. Plus, the ease is a big aspect of it.<br /><br />Most importantly though, it removed my fear of the kitchen, since I never truly felt comfortable cooking anything. And because of that, I can experiment and create my own culinary world. And that's pretty amazing, considering I wasn't planning on actually cooking anything.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I think I like it, I just can't get it to show up so I can play it. It's been downloaded and installed but can find it. Have any suggestions?
B002JOUNDY|5.0|I watch this movie every year for Halloween. It's admittedly not the best film ever in my opinion, but it's still very entertaining. FINALLY I get to watch it in widescreen. Previously I  was only able to find it in full-frame on DVD. Now you get to watch this the way the director of photography originally wanted you to see it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have actually gone back and RE-READ this series! CANNOT wait for a movie!! I have actually gotten my husband, mom, and sister to read these books and my mother and sister LOVED them as much as I did.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Congratulating Adele for '21' surpassing the 10 million units sold in the U.S.giving '21' it's Diamond Certification! In the summer of 2012 she needed 500,000 to make it and I thought it would be early 2013 before she made it.But when I first heard the excellent 'Skyfall' Bond theme I knew that new fans who loved Skyfall would go and buy '21'! and it looks like they did!(probably got '19' too)! I usually don't boast but this for all the Adele haters who by the way  might as well get ready as she could win another Grammy and an Oscar for 'Skyfall'! Congrats Adele!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I LOVED this series and will most likely re-re-read them since I have already done so twice. they were that good. couldn't put them down
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I love this story.  Its hard to ge through but its worth it in the long run - the story really is more than just a simple theatrical play.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could NOT put down these books! I actually found myself reading them at work. I was referred them by a friend, and i wasn't sure i was going to like them. but I have read the series twice because I LOVED them.
0394800184|5.0|I read this story to my son every other night and alternate it with any of his other Dr. Seuss books.
0345472322|5.0|As a child who was always enrolled in &#34;gifted&#34; classes, I always was annoyed by classmates who outperformed me with their work ethic (and enjoyed working hard too, how's that possible?). I thought to myself &#34;It doesn't matter. I have more talent than them.&#34; 20 years later, those hard workers have made something of themselves, and I'm trying to figure out what went wrong.<br /><br />This book helped me get out of the trap of thinking what I'm meant to do in life will come naturally. Now, I'm working harder than ever and enjoying life more. I guarantee I'd still be wallowing in self pity, mad at society for not understanding my brilliance, had I not read this book.
B003LQMZS0|5.0|My son still loves this lil thing many months after he should have cast is asunder.  Its his car friend now.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|If life is boring you to the point of tears, give this show a try. Watch a self sufficient, good man confront death and explore the animal within during a time of mortal uncertainty.
B0035OC830|4.0|Always a good read from this author.<br />Bill Bryson always sees the riduclous in a situation. Good observations even on home soil.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I really enjoyed this game and love that you can reset it and play again. Great graphics and sound. Very nice layout. Bring on some more. Also the price also made it well worth it!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the whole Hunger Games trilogy. This book was very fitting end. Hoping they make movies of book two and.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a great set, all 3 films, loads of extra material and an attractive case. Why just buy the new film when for just $5 more you can get all 3!
B004ZJZPXO|1.0|The DVD plays just fine; however, the Blu-Ray won't play.  When put into the Play Station, the PS does not even know it's there.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Good historical fiction is hard to beat.  I love reviewing my knowledge of history from the personal viewpoint.  The characters in this book are so real to life.  I appreciate the author stayed very close to actual historic facts.  It was wonderful seeing events unfold from the viewpoint of people instead of memorizing facts and dates like we did in old fashion history classes.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I think it gives you to many quests after you get to level 9. Other then that it is a very fun game, I really like the grubbins they are cute and remind me of gremilins.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|Imagination at its peak...You either love it or hate it..Too much fantasy to the extent that absorbing it becomes really difficult.I must admit that some of the author's creations were magical.
B001KVZ6FW|2.0|I purchased this DVD as a gift for my mother.  We were extremely disappointed to find that the disc frequently froze in place, at one point several times in the course of just a few minutes.  We were forced to skip a portion of a scene as the DVD would not unfreeze.  Despite purchasing this DVD brand new and at full price, it was apparent that it had been damaged.  I love this film, but the disc's condition was unacceptable.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I got this book because my 11 year old son is reading it for school. So many lessons to learn. Would I have been Auggie's friend or would I have been judgemental?  Touching, sweet, and a life lesson in acceptance all in one. Now my son just needs to finish so we can talk about it.
B00A0SQBDM|3.0|I was under the impression that it was free and got so far and couldn't go any further. VERY disappointing!
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|A realistic look at the old west with a sense of humour......Good to see this one without the commercial on tv.....
141694737X|5.0|This flap book is our (now) 18 months old grandsons favorite book when visiting at grammys house.  Books are his favorite (toy) so far and I try to keep my house filled with lots of different types, flap books, books that make noise, etc.  This one is by far is favorite right now and has been for a couple months.  He loves flap books especially if they are about animals.  He will search his bookshelf even if I try to hide it, he always come up with this one first, and it has to be read many times over, or he reads it to himself.  Nice and sturdy board book, simple animal drawings, and easy to open flaps.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I love the songs--and play the CD over and over.  I've shared the CD with friends who also feel the music is timeless.
B001EC2J20|2.0|They should rename it. It should be entitled the Erotix, There are many scenes of Neo banging the Canadian broad. These scenes are not particularly clever, though. And I am jealous because I wish I could bone her. At any rate, there is another worthless erotix scene in a cave where the people of Zion get horny on some cheesy techno tune. That's pretty much the plot! Oh well, there is also Smith, the agent that Neo destroyed in the first Matrix. Now, not only does Smith manage to come back to life, but he clones itself a thousand times by sticking his hand into people--I kid you not.<br /><br />What else? While the characters were cool and tough in the first movie, here in the erotix they just want to skrew each other. I forgot, in this episode, Neo is superman.<br /><br />I am firmly convinced that if you enjoyed the first Matrix you will be very, very disappointed in this one.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|War Horse is an excellent movie.  It does a wonderful job of portraying the struggle of whether to follow orders or follow your heart, etc.  It is truly wonderful as many others have already shared. :)
B004V5A7K8|4.0|This is a pretty fun game that you can play anytime. I usually play a level or two when I'm bored. Eventually you get to level 75 or 78 and you can't advance past that. Outside of replaying the final level or starting a new game, there are no other options. It would be nice to restart from the beginning with you current score and maybe a smaller paddle or faster balls. Still, the game is pretty entertaining.
0307341577|5.0|This scared me senseless.  I loved it for that. A great psychological thriller. I like the fact that all of her books take place in Missouri.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|First, this book is not just about cooking. I mean it says that in the title. It is about learning. It uses cooking as a vehicle to teach the process of learning.<br /><br />Second, you probably have heard most of the information that is in this book at some point in your life. So, what makes this book special? What makes this book a must read is the connections that are made between the different bits of information. This twist bring a whole new understanding to familiar information. In the end, this book will change your approach to learning.<br /><br />Third, It is entertaining.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This a lovely easygoing game to pass time.  It<br />is simple and easy to use.  A game for all ages.
1594203334|5.0|This was a great book.  It was very engaging and easy to read.  I appreciated the thoughtful summary of Pamela Druckerman's perception of French parenting.  What I really loved is that it presents another, successful, approach to childbirth and rearing other than attachment parenting which is so ubiquitous in the US today..  I think it gives parents in America more perspective and the reminder that there is more than one way to parent.  If attachment parenting sounds all-consuming and not quite right for you, this might be a great read.  I wouldn't take this as parenting advice, rather, just like visiting another country does, this book expands your perspective and awareness of parenting approaches other than those you've seen or read about here in America.  Bottom-line: this book is really easy to read and quite entertaining with many anecdotes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is a little bit behind the PC version, but amazing! Great job making this app, Mojang! One of my favorite apps!
B009K45Y62|3.0|OK, so all of you Batman nerds want this Limited Edition Bat Cowl Blu-ray set right? Here's the scoop on this sucker. Although it may be a Limited Edition -- it doesn't feel that way. The item is a cheap plastic \\"Bat Cowl\\" and it sits on a plastic base, nothing more, and nothing less. The biggest gripe you can have with this is that the Blu-ray disc(s) and DVD are stored in a plastic case. The case has cheap stickers that seem to peel off a bit on each side, which it includes the bat logo. That same plastic case that guards your discs is then shoved back into the base where the bat cowl sits on top of. It's a little annoying taking the discs out, too, because they're not only stacked on top of each other with no felt or anything between them--but the button to release the discs is a hassle to push because of the set up.<br /><br />I'll say this much though, the movie (as it did in theaters) packs a huge PUNCH. If you have a surround sound, your ears will bleed and I mean that in the best way possible. If you have an expensive LED television to which you enjoy all of your films on--your eyes will gasm at the site of the picture. The special features are in 1080p; this also includes a new \\"SECOND SCREEN\\" feature. This feature allows you to download an app to your cell phone, which will allow you to \\"play along with the film.\\" A little strange at first, but as long as your Blu-ray player and mobile phone are hooked up on the same Wi-Fi, you will have no problems testing this out.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give this set 3 out of 5 stars. My problem was with the limited edition stand that came with it (as I aforementioned). And another small thing I didn't like was the packaging. The packaging is obviously plastic that the cowl stand is stored in, but the number of the set you received (mines 30,196 out of 35,000) is on a sticker that sits out on this plastic and isn't engraved or numbered on the stand itself. So if you want to keep your numbered plastic packaging to holdyour bat cowl in (takes up a lot of room on a shelf) then great. I'm not sure why people are spending and selling this thing for over $100, because it's not worth it. Granted it is a numbered limited run, but don't let that bother you into buying the film itself. It's a sure pleasure to movie fans to watch, and will entertain those who aren't familiar with the series and Christopher Nolan's filming style.<br /><br />P.S<br />Nothing to do with the film or plastic bat head, but Amazon shipped this 2-day shipping item with FedEx, which in turn -- turned this into a couple of days late instead of being here on time. Already complained, but Amazon shouldn't use Fedex anymore.
B00992CF6W|1.0|don't get this game it will fry your kindle And there are these green guys who kill you and the game will hack you mojang wants to take over the world and kill us ALL.  GET SKIRIM
B005RUUUAI|4.0|I like the show the quality of the show on the computer was fine. No lagging problems so overall is worth the price
B008NW67E0|5.0|I love this band and was very excited for their next installment....I was not let down! The album is true to the band and their now infamous sound. Best part was I received the cd 2 days after ordering it. I love fast shipment :)
B004SBX112|1.0|This latest &quot;update&quot; (5 December 2012) no longer runs on my original Kindle Fire. It certainly used to previously. I already paid for this a year ago and refuse to have to pay another $3 for the Kindle-specific version. Whether this is Amazon's doing or Rovio's, I don't know but either way it's crappy practice.
1476715904|5.0|I just want to say that Slammed and Point of Retreat are now my favorite books ive ever read!! I laughed and cried so much. I finished both books in 2 days and didnt get anything else done because I just couldnt put them down! Amazing job Colleen Hoover
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Enjoying this book, so far.  Still have a few chapters to go before it's finished.  Some new characters mixed in with the old.  I'm not as big a fan of some of the newer characters so that's why I only gave it 4 of 5 stars.<br />I will be eagerly awaiting for book 6 once I've finished this one.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I have been listening to this in my car for 2-3 weeks and am not sick of it yet!<br />There is only one or two songs that aren't my favorite (the song 22 is one of the ones I find annoying.)<br /><br />I am a Swift fan at heart.<br />The only thing I wish is that she would write a few more songs that AREN'T about her famous boyfriends... I feel bad for them... How is she any different than a tabloid when she does this?<br /><br />I love &#34;Never Ever Getting Back Together&#34; and song 10 (Can't remember the title) best of all...and Begin Again.
B0091REZMW|4.0|ok so far.  love the graphics. just getting started. easy to see details in the scenery. no issues with locking up or freezing
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a wonderful game if you can ignore the ad that rises between hands as I have learned to. Spider is a simple game but fun and addicting. You can play at 4 different levels. One of the games I play most.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Purchased this product to cut 250 wine bottles for centerpieces for a formal event. After receipt (which came in a timely manner) we read the instructions (score, submerge in boiling water then immediately into ice water). We followed those instructions and after about an hour had 1 fairly usable bottle and probably 15 broken ones.  Thanks to the internet we followed another set of instructions (score, hold over lighted candle and rotate the bottle with flame right on score about 30 seconds,then immediately into a bucket of ice water). Wow what a difference.  If the  bottom didn't pop off after the first try it did the second round of what the instructions called \\"fire and ice\\".<br /><br />In short, the product is good, the product works but their instructions don't.  The above way is quicker, easier and more successful.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is by far the best Angry Birds app they've made. Much more fun and challenging, you have to overcome space drift, orbital pull and more. Different birds with different capabilities and seeing them as Star Wars characters is a lot of fun. Graphics are crisp and clean and the game is well-paced. Starts out so easy and then gets progressively more complex. After playing this, I doubt I will ever play the other Angry Birds again. HIGHLY recommend this app.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I could spend hours playing this game. There is so much to do! You can set up the city any way you want. It really keeps my creativity flowing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think everybody should get this game it is the best game ever!!! it is a trickster game if you like trickster games and get addicted to trickey games you should get it if you don't like tricky games don't get this game.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Love this game! Very addicting! Ive completed almost all the puzzles. I first played the original version but im loving the color addition as well. Wish there were more.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Naive young college grad meets high powered exec with a mood disorder and proclivity for sex with violent overtones. It's not a fairy tale and there is no happy ending. The character's don't evolve much and we never learn why the main character is so messed up. So why all the hype? It's an immature story line with delusions of grandeur - one step removed from the Harlequin Romance Novels of my youth. Don't waste your time.
B004LWZWGA|1.0|Movies is good but don't buy this version. It is a total rip off! Ultra Violet Sucks! What a waste of money!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Despite my disappointment with Book One I read the second book thinking that there must be more to the story and that I would uncover it as I read on. Surely it couldn't be that popular of a book without something of merit, right? Nope. It was pure trash - poorly written, poorly edited and without a strong story line. It reads as if it were written by a 15 year old girl who thinks being submissive is somehow romantic. Clearly the author ran out of words from the built-in thesaurus on the computer in Book One - how many times can one person murmur? There is not one redeemable quality to this story. Do yourself a favor and donate the money you would have spent on this book to charity. I'll gladly give you my copy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This a great app for balancing my checkbook.  I was just about to buy a new calculator when I ran across this one; and it was free!  Whoo hoo!

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I love playing this but it has a serious glitch. I was up to level 110 and went back in to play and it was gone. Game was started over. Restarted it got to level 30 and it was gone, started over again. Got to level 16 then it was gone again. Done!!!
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|Super awesome game for keeping old brains active and stimulating young ones to learn while having a blast! It is truly Awesome for multi-generational enjoyment.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|Classic Reacher. Perfect hero, not super hero just feels real.  Fast read. Tom Cruise might not be the best casting. Definitely not 6'6\\".
B000BDLJBU|2.0|I am only going by my personal experience. I realize most other reviewers fared better. I had an easier time soldering a cheaper version than the Neutrik model. Again, maybe I lack the necessary skills and, perhaps, I didn't watch enough videos on Youtube or, maybe, I need to upgrade my soldering iron but the cheap, plasticky, plug I ended up using was much easier to work with, even though it didn't look as pretty as this one.<br />My biggest hurdle is trying to get the solder to stick, even after using flux.<br />In any case, even if it is my lack of skill, I think these plugs should be no more than a couple of bucks each (I probably paid, after shipping and handling, between 5 and 10 dollars for one plug). I have bought 3.5mm plugs before and I've never had to pay this much, no matter the beautiful and practical curved design. Perhaps due to excessive heat on my part, the ground metal tip broke off but the price issue remains...
1449410243|4.0|Thanks to this book, I now know everything there is to know about my feline friend.  Has some good extra content not from the site.  Knocking a star off because I was hoping for more variety than the BobCats (it's like 50% of the whole book, if not more)

B0002VFXFE|5.0|I have no thermal issues associated with a Asus Z77 Sabertooth LGA1155 motherboard with an Intel Quad Core i7 3770 processor aboard using the stock Intel fan and heatsink.  The Arctic Silver 5 Polysynthetic Silver Thermal Compound Paste is doing its heat transfer thing as advertised with the heatsink assembly keeping the processor junction temps under control.. I just got the rig together and working last night and don't plan to overclock too much in the future since I didn't get the 3770K.  So I can look forward to cool nights and low fan noise.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|I thought overall this movie was very good!  The slow start almost had me turn it off, but I am glad that I didn't because I really enjoyed it.  The characters were all very interesting...and well acted.  I would recommend watching the movie, and sticking with it through the slow beginning.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|LOVE this CD!!  Christina has still got it and is one of the best singers of all time.  Definitely worth purchasing.  Love the duets with Blake Shelton and CeLo Green.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|This is a great game, it's pretty much the only game on the kindke that i like. It has an awesome free-roam city, but the web-slingning can be tricky.<br />My only problem with this is that after i use it a lot and then close it, i can't open it again. It goes through the logos and then the video, but after that, it just takes you right back to the home screen. Still haven't been able to get back on, but i'm working on it.<br />Overall, though, this is a great game, worth your money.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|While this is a very dark interpretation of Snow White and was expertly filmed the fact that Kristen Stewart has no acting ability ruined it for me.
B000OPOAJS|4.0|Robert de Niro always making the cool roles... if you wanna watch a cool movie from the undergrounds this is for you. I think i bought my Audi just beacause of this movie, really nice marketing strategy from these guys. The S8 would be always at the top of cool cars ever needed for a getaway. If you are not into action, dont even consider this movie.
B005SV9X22|5.0|I think Lady Gaga is extremely talented although I don't agree with her use of drugs.  I wish I had her body.<br /><br />I would recommend.
B0085KGHOK|3.0|i bought this for a friend but then we saw it togeter and I think the filmaking is not that good.
B008NMT684|4.0|My 2 1/2 year old loves this game.  He took to it immediately.  But can't figure out how to get to the next levels.
B001FB55YE|4.0|Similar to Snatch... if you love London this movie is for you, great scenes of the city.Guy Ritchie always pushing the edge.
B0081BU42O|4.0|Although one could see the ending coming a mile away, Banks weaving of characters is always a pleasure to move through.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|I have most of the Marvel comic book movies and they are all pretty good. The quality is also great in Bluray
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|I think this is Train's best &#34;album&#34; yet. Great diversity. Everything from a salsa style, a country style (expect Bruises to be a crossover hit), and good old Train style. Foot tapping and sing along music all the way through.
0525953590|5.0|This is an excellent book. It explains everything clearly, simply and in an engaging way. It includes all the necessary background science that sets the scene for the higgs and why it is important, plus a lot of stories and anecdotes. I truly enjoyed this book and learnt a lot.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|But I loved it anyway!  A lot of people compare to the Grey series, and it has so many similarities.  But in my opinion the writing is much better and the characters are even more likable.  Totally think she could make two more books out of this story and I'd buy them instantly.
B004GJDQT8|2.0|I prefer accessing the site directly. And the full site more than the mobile site.<br /><br />The information on the app is limited and not all content from the product appears. I work for a mobile app company and realize how mobile apps are limited in the sense of displaying data... but it can be done. I often just go to the website.<br /><br />Why can you buy a shirt through the app but not a Kindle book? For Kindle books, I only have the option to &#34;Add to Wish List&#34;.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I wanted this book to go on so I could see how the characters and their relationships continued to evolve.  I cared about them as if they were people  I knew. Normally I don't care for books to go back and forth from the present to the past, but this story couldn't have been told any other way. This was a wonderful read!
B0068FYZCA|5.0|Great film to transport you back to the good times!  So many things in the movie were true to life for me!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love this, just as I did the rest of the series. Would like to see more of these stories from her!!!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I enjoy the Mitch Rapp series of books.  I will miss this character when the series ends, so Mr. Flynn keep writing.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Good book as far as keeping your attention. A little all over the place as far as the story goes. I could see it going in a different direction and being much more appealing.
B00770KR7W|5.0|I couldn't find it anywhere in stores, but it was exactly what I was looking for. The gun that comes with it is a bit useless. But other than that, it's great.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This is an outstanding DVD of a great band.  My nephew absolutely loved it.  If you like the Eagles, you should get this!
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Good movie kept me guessing where the plot was going.. action & effects were a nice touch. One that I will probably buy.
0451529065|5.0|exactly what i ordered and in a timely manner. they met my expectations easily. i look forward to finishing this book. I would much rather read about Evolution directly from Darwin, rather than listen to the multitudes of people give their opinion, without even reading this book. this should be a must read for anyone that has to deal with petty debates.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Having watched seasons one and two of TWD on Netflix, I wanted to proceed to season three. They did not have any of the season three episodes and I wanted to catch up so I decided to try a trial subscription with another provider that carried current episodes.  Well, after two days of trying to even find what I was looking for on the most user-unfriendly site I ever visited, the lightbulb in my head turned on saying, Try Amazon.  I did and in two minutes I was watching the first of the episodes I wanted to see.  Gotta love Amazon!
B001D0DQUC|5.0|Love this movie.  It is an 80's classic.  My older kids loved it.  The price to rent is a steal.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I read this book as a book club choice.  It turned out to be way more interesting than I expected.  Max Brooks broaches the subject of apocalyptic survival of humanity from so many different perspectives.  While it is about zombies, the truth is that you could plug in any major threat to survival in its place and it would still work.  This is not purely a zombie book.
1400052181|5.0|I'm a nursing major and my chemistry professor made me read this as an extra credit thingy. She thought we have to know who Henrietta Lacks is. I'm glad she did. This is an excellent book for everyone but especially for people in health care profession.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Ken Follett makes the history of the early 20th century live.  This book is long on detail about World War I presented memorably through the lenses of it's major characters.  It's the first time I've understood how the war started and how it impacted the future of Europe.  I couldn't put it down and look forward to reading the second book in the trilogy.
B00571F26Y|5.0|My daughter has gluten issues this book is informative and will answer a lot of questions about what to eat and what not to eat.
B00079HZUM|5.0|I think this movie deserves more attention than it gets. Really well-acted, with a good story. If you are an actor, this is also totally an &#34;actor's&#34; movie. The end scene will have you hopping up and down. Highly recommended.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I would say this movie was OK.  not the greatest but i guess it was entertaining. I wouldn't brag that i seen it
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follet is an amazing writer. I have read all of his books and this one is right there with the best. The sequel Winter of the World is equally good. Highly recommend.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|i didn't really care for the movie. but everyone to its own. I fell asleep if that tells you anything
0385535147|5.0|Another excellent read by John Grisham! One of my favorite authors and was not dissappointed by his latest novel. I would recommend this book to others!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|i thought this was a good movie. I stayed interested the whole movie. and i'm a tuff critic. i would watch it again.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|The book kept me more or less interested during a long plane ride. Ingenious plot twists were certainly entertaining, but the writing was incredibly pedestrian, and the dialogue didn't ring true.  I simply do not think that African Americans speak the way they do in the novel.  While some may argue that escapist fiction does not need to be believable as long as it is diverting, I do not subscribe to that view.  Two stars.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|it was an ok movie lots of action loved to see all the extra movie stars in it. kinda carny at times but hey.
B0090O07S2|5.0|There has been very little decent live video/adio of the Doors until now. I had a VHS copy of this concert obtained about 12 years ago. The new DVD, remastered for both sound and video, is incredible. This will make you feel like you've seen the Doors play live....at their Prime. I shouldn't say this, but they could have charged $100 and it would still be well worth it. This is a great deal and one you will truly enjoy. Enjoy!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|wasn't to sure about the movie but it turned out to be a pretty good flick. i would recommend it.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|If you only learn 5 recipes out of the book it will have paid for itself. Delicious and simple. Thanks, Tim!
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Quality and actors were phenomenol.  The only disappointment of the entire show was the chandelier didn't fall, only exploded.  Wish I could have been there in person.  Sierra Boggess, Ramin Karimloo and Hadley Fraser were amazing.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Couldn't stop watching!!! This is a much watch program...highly recommend this series! Would make a great gift for someone special
0061692042|5.0|Richard Ford doesn't like any kind of criticism, positive or negative. That's fine, but I'm his reader so I'm going to say my piece. The writing in this book is precise, exact, clear, and perfectly pitched. Maybe all those adjectives mean the same thing, which is: The damned book is a fine piece of work! As I read Dell Parsons' story about his childhood, his mismatched and fugitive parents, his lost sister, his being 15 years old and adrift in another country among strangers, I was taken hostage by the prose: Ford's quiet, no nonsense word choices that exact the inner sanctum of a pushed boy crossing into adulthood and eventually into Canada from Great Falls, Montana. The landscape too plays a role here, the great forests and fields and mountains, and the vast emptiness that surrounds the characters. It creates an inner focus, an editing away of extraneous details and a feeling for the fundamentals of living: family, responsibilities, individual choices and actions. I found broad themes here: the pivotal events in people's lives that determine how they choose to live out the rest of their time; the moments when borders, all kinds of borders, lawful and unlawful, are approached and crossed and then there's no going back; the fundamental dynamics of parents imprinting themselves on their children and how that translates or not into love and well being; the ultimate wrestling with death. I found moments of intense violence, all the more powerful and realistic because they exist in an environment of quiet normalcy, which establishes itself again after the acts are complete. It's all in the writing, in Ford's choices, all no doubt long thought out and superbly logical and right.<br /><br />This novel is the best novel I have read in the past two years.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this series! This is such an interesting series. The characters become family. Once I started watching I couldn't stop! Very addicting
0547884591|5.0|Excellent book, not sure what other people are reading who are rating it 1 star.  There is so much quallity material, I don't know how he sells it for so little.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Ordered this for my son so he can have some old school Disney movies for when he gets older. Obviously it's an awesome product.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Works like a charm. I can see and edit all my boards and pin the hours away. It loads everything pretty fast on my kindle fire.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|I loved Toy Story growing up, so I got the DVDs for my son so he can also enjoy them. We've already watched it about 3 times.
B004G6009K|5.0|I like my children's movies, and when this came on blu ray I knew my bf would watch it with me too. Good deal and shipping was quick with prime!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Batman is pretty awesome & I'm glad they finally included Bane in a movie. Not the biggest fan of Anne Hathaway as Selina, but whatever...Tom Hardy as Bane made up for it. I would recommend this movie to others.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|Works very well connecting my Kindle Fire HD to my Windows 7 Desktop PC ...... No problems at all. SIMPLE to install and run
B002T9H2LK|5.0|I have been saying &#34;That's a bingo&#34; since I purchased this. Excellent movie...that's really all I can say about it.
8866131024|5.0|This is the 3rd year I have gotten one of these small Moleskine calendars.  I really like the 1 day per page layout with NO lines on the page, and I love the bright lime green color of the cover!  This is a small calendar, but as someone who is trying to simplify what I am doing and trying to become less overcommited, I want a more restricted size page to write on.  It helps me be more realistic about what I can or should try to do per day, and for me it has plenty of room to write down the essentials.  Also, the small size is super portable, which is very handy.  There is a normal month at a glance type calendar for the year at the front--the squares are small, but if you want to see an overview of the month or mark down something simple like circle your vacation days or put an X on which days you did some repeated task it works fine, and I find it to be very helpful.  If you don't want a small page size on your calendar, you won't like this one.  The only other point that is somewhat inconvenient is that the calendar does not indicate US holidays or important dates like daylight savings time change day etc.  Personally, that does not deter me, and I simply write in that info from another source.  I hope Amazon keeps carrying this small green calendar in the future!
B007THA4FI|4.0|Although there were times when I was reading that I felt depressed by the dark side of the lives of ordinary people that were depicted,  I found the book well worth reading. J.K. Rowling is a keen observer of life and her ability to portray the young people in her story gives them a realism that is gripping. She is an excellent writer. Her interest in working for the benefit of under-privileged children has clearly contributed to this novel.
B009IAIBAE|5.0|Killer 2012 Re-Issue of the classic &#34;Piece Of Mind&#34; on nice quality Picture LP, a MUST have for any IRON MAIDEN fan or collector.
B00008L3U1|4.0|I think it could've been a bit more protected but other then that it was a great order. I'll be ordering again soon.
B00000K2UX|5.0|great music, great movie, the music can get you in a up and moving mood just try it and see if you can sit still.....great
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I liked the way they sent this product, it was protected very nicely and was at my door few days after ordering. I will be ordering again.
0345525558|4.0|This book frustrated me.  One minutes I'm routing for Victoria, and the next she makes me angry.  This girl is probably the most \\"broken\\" girl I've ever read about.  When I first started the book, I thought the author went into too much detail about Victoria's emotions.  As I read further, I realized that this was necessary.<br />Each chapter goes back and forth between Victoria's past and present.  I think this was brilliantly done, and you'll have to read it to find out why.<br />This review is short because I'm in the hospital.  In the end though, I want to convey that this book really makes you think about your own relationships.  A great book!  Oh, and there is a flower glossary in the back of the book that is very useful!
1934030554|5.0|top notch info on using a power meter.  It's a must have for any triathlete looking to improve cycling performance.
0515149489|4.0|Can you imagine being on an island that provides santuary?<br />Imagine falling in love, having your own business, and thinking you are at peace.<br />Well...that's until you have to protect you and your loved one's from a serial killer.<br />This was a great story of love and strength.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|I found this movie to very enjoyable. It is not great art, obviously. It does have very good action sequences, and either very good actors (Brian Cox, Morgan Freeman, John Malcovich, Helen Mirren) or actors who are good fits for their roles (Bruce Willis, Kyle Urban).<br /><br />The script is a little goofy, but the quality of the acting makes it work rather than turning it into a schlocky 80s action movie. I watched this several years ago in a hotel room, and have rented it once and since purchased it.
0547884591|5.0|Reading the book is half complete. Application of principles that the book portrays would make my review a little more complete. Five stars for showing a different way that the traditional route.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|First in a line of books,well written but don't know if I would purchase the next bookin the same story line. More for the young adult person.
1608862801|5.0|I ordered this for my brother-in-law, he's a fan of the show and he's a comic book fan, I know he's going to love it!  He hasn't received it yet, but I am positive it will be well received!  It is incredible, the colors, the artwork, it's just AWESOME and I love it!  I want to order one for myself now!  Super fast shipping, etc. etc. etc.  I can't say enough good things! :-)
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Give all the details you expect for a true story. Maybe not the way I would do things but that is the story
B004U8VWLE|2.0|This was a very dark movie and I most certainly did not like the ending. The first half of the movie was okay but then it takes a very weird turn.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is more than a dictionary. It has the weather, horoscopes, games to improve vocabulary and it's free! This is a steal, worth a gem. GET THIS APP, it's the best dictionary and thesaurus, Much better than paid dictionaries aswell.

B002NZV68U|5.0|Are you bored of watching the same old movie?  Well you should try watching fantastic, great, mouth dropping Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!  There are late5 kids that are allowed to go to Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory with willy Wonka's Chocolate bar!  If you go to that factory don't get over exited because you can eat every thing.  Charlie has no problem.  It is so funny because the oompa loompas are chanting Agustest Gloop Violet Berugaurd varuca Sault Mike Teeve! It is great! It is a mouth dropping movie! You should try it! It is fantastic and funny! I recommend it is 5 stars!  Hudson SAS

B007PVHMCG|5.0|Are you bored of playing the same old game?  Then play Minecraft it is a fantastic game because Minecraft haves no rules.  On Minecraft you can build your own houses and caves.  On Minecraft you can us the sword to kill the zombies.  And kill animal to get meat for eating.  I love Minecraft!  You should try Minecraft.  It is a amazing game!<br /><br />Asher SAS
B008YWY0HK|5.0|We saw this at the show and we loved it. We pre-ordered it and have watched it over and over. The one bear was a bit scary for our 5yr old grandson who we do not let see most movies, but after he saw the story through, he was good with it.<br /><br />Can't say enough about how much we love it.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Are you bored of watching the same movie over and over again? If you are you should watch Brave because it is hilarious and creepy and amazing. Some parts are not funny. The little girls mother turns into a bear because the witch gives the girl a bear cake. This part might make you cry but it is still an amazing movie. There is a prince named Marmadue, who turns in to a bear. I hope you watch brave because it is an amazing movie! Five stars it is!<br />The end<br />Brave<br />By Molly SAS
B005LLX582|4.0|Personally, I detest films that test a film watcher's inability to remain serenely enthusiastic. Patience is my virtue, and this production is virtuous. Kudos to Terrence Malick and an exceptional cast.
6305428050|5.0|My wife and I rented this movie after it first left theaters, back in 1987, the year before our daughter was born, and we loved it. So when we thought our daughter would appreciate it, we rented it again. Since then she has practivally memorized it, and we repeat lines from it whenever the opportunity arises.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love it. Love it. Love it. Enjoying it greatly. Great for a free game.  whole family enjoying it....What else can I say
B008KE3960|5.0|I've been addicted to this game for a while, it' s free and tons of fun!  Graphics are great as well.

B004LWZWGK|1.0|******SPOILER WARNING!!!!!!!!!!*******<br /><br />I saw the movie in the theaters, and I thought it was slow, plodding, and all over the place. BUT, I had gone to the \\"Marathon\\" showing, so we're talking sitting in a theater for 5 1/2 hours watching the first two before even getting to this one.<br />So, I thought maybe I was just movie'd out and tired.<br />So, I rented it last night to give it a fair shake.<br />Didn't help.<br />First off, this movie broke the two rules that have killed every superhero movie I've ever seen, especially for a finale:<br />1. Don't introduce new characters that you have to spend all this time on to give a backstory.<br />2. Never have two enemies for the hero to fight in one movie, because you end up giving each character getting a half-assed story, because once again, both characters need a backstory.<br />The movie starts with Gotham already cleaned up and crime-free.<br />Why take it so far down the road?<br />The title The Dark Knight Rises implied, to me, at least, that Batman, now hunted for killing Harvey Dent would return to save Gotham and finally be hailed by its people as their protector.<br />Nope.<br />Instead of Bane staying what he was in the comic books-a drug kingpin-they make him a merc. They give him a mask, which makes him sound like the love-child of Sean Connery and Darth Vader, who possibly suffered a severe concussion at birth, making him hard to hear sometimes.<br />Then we get Catwoman, whose character does nothing but drag this thing out to almost a whopping 3 hours.<br />SCHINDLER'S LIST WAS THREEE HOURS!<br />BATMAN IS NOT SCHINDLER'S LIST!<br />Bane and Batman finally have a fight, and, of course, Batman never attempts to rip this pain-killing mask off his face. No, Bane, instead breaks his back a-la DC's Broken Bat.<br />So, now, after enduring Catwoman's needless presence, Bane's long-winded diatribes, we have to sit and watch Bruce get out of a hole while learning life lessons from his fellow hole-dwellers. It's like Disney only with ruptured discs And Bruce does try to get out of that hole. Try, after try, after try.<br />Meanwhile, Bane is in Gotham, took it over. Spouts, \\"People of Gotham, the city is yours. You're free!\\" And they are free, unless you count the fusion device he'll explode if they try to leave.<br />You've got the intrepid young cop, who magically knows Bruce is Batman, because he looked into his eyes. Kinda like the way George Bush looked into Putin's eyes and knew he was an okay guy.<br />And guess what?<br />He's Robin!<br />What?<br />You've got Daggett in there, you've got the Scarecrow in there, you've got Matthew Modine in there for no other reason than I guess he knows Chris Nolan, Jim Gordon has the pleasure of having his reputation ruined, Alfred gets kicked out because Bruce is all Emo now, and at the end you get . . . wait for it . . . TALIA!<br />Why?<br />Because you can't have a stew without carrots!<br />Let's just chuck 'em all in there for the last big bang!<br />But what happened to the Fusion Bomb?<br />Batman flies in and grabs it with his Bat Plane and carries it out over Gotham Bay and it explodes!<br />He saved Gotham!<br />He also irradiated the water supply, but that's beside the point.<br />The whole movie looked like a mash-up of two, maybe three scripts, thrown together to make something so dull and stupid, it was excruciating.<br />And, must've been an ego thing, at the end, we see Bruce in an outdoor bistro with Selena after faking his own death, ready to live the quiet life.<br />So, I walked into this movie expecting to see The Dark Knight Rises . . .<br />And what I got was The Dark Knight Retires.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|A good read. This is my first Lee Child book. I really enjoyed the character Jack Reacher and already have book #2 and #3 ready to start. I like Child's writing style and the way the story flows.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|\\"All that such a poem as `Four Quartets' may accomplish is to relate one remarkable man's vision of time, self, reality, and eternity: to describe one person's experience of transcendence. Because there does exist a community of souls, it is possible for some other human beings to apprehend the poet's symbols of transcendence; and to draw analogies between those symbolic images and their own fleeting glimpses, in the journey of this life...\\" - Russell Kirk, \\"Eliot and His Age\\"<br /><br />To begin a review of Terrence Malick's \\"Tree of Life\\" with a comparison of this director's artistic vision with that of T.S. Eliot is appropriate. In both we find an awestruck wonder for the immense majesty of Creation and experience. Over the course of four poems collected into \\"Four Quartets,\\" Eliot gives life to a perspective of the eternal: the wind-stricken stones at Burnt Norton, the god-like meander of rivers, the fields of sunflowers. While Eliot achieved all of this with words, Malick has the benefit of actual visual images, and what images they are! Coupled with a glittering soundtrack of wall-to-wall requiem masses and operatic arias, the visuals of \\"Tree of Life\\" are things of rare beauty and depth.<br /><br />At the core, we have the story of a family in Texas told through the eyes of its eldest son. His progression away from childhood innocence toward experience and knowledge wavers between the grace of his mother (the exquisite and empyreal Jessica Chastain) and the mercurial \\"tough love\\" of his father (the stern and stormy Brad Pitt). Malick punctuates the narrative with grand visions of the universe in its becoming and whispered voice-over prayers. In another director's hands, the human story would have been dwarfed by the wide spaces of the stars, as if to say a man's life is infinitesimal...constricted by time, lorded over by unfathomable forces. Yet, Malick presents us with the opposite: a death in the family is the very center of the film, and the resulting spiritual journeys of the bereaved give rise to the epic scenes and silences.<br /><br />Consider the perplexing and much-lauded 20-minute interlude where we break away from the family in mourning to watch the colossal genesis of time and space. Entire galaxies drip through the dark like platelets, oceans swell with invertebrate life, and dinosaurs meet in a misty creek bed. Yet, with the collision of one lethal asteroid, the unfolding pageant of life stops cold. Note how the rock gracefully glides through space, slowly turning to Berlioz's \\"Offertorium,\\" seeming to suggest choreography...latent intent behind the intersecting paths of planet and projectile. The following images of tundra and ice cap segue to a \\"new earth\\" and human life...more importantly, the human story. Malick intends us to see this impressive cosmic segment as a metaphor for, and foreshadowing of, the tragic death of the son: the cataclysm which spans the gulf between life and new life. Here we come to understand the use of Job 38 in the film's titles: what heartbreak can be beyond the comprehension of a Creator who formed such marvelous things and existed before the very bedrock cooled? By the end of the film, we find the same family meeting at the shores of Time for reunion and resignation.<br /><br />Rather than a lecture on metaphysical speculations and spiritual meditations, Malick has given us the visceral images of a life augmented (not engulfed) by Mystery. It reminds us that in all this expanding and uncharted space, there is a human heart that spans and outlasts Time. As Faulkner said: \\"[Man] is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance.\\" \\"Tree of Life\\" is what a film ought to be, utilizing the bare essential of the medium--the image--to arouse that sense of whelming wonder in each of us.

B001TCHDPS|5.0|If there was ever a street poet Rodriguez is it, &#34;Cold Fact&#34; was his debut album and was a gritty portrail of what was happening in the streets where is this is a softer album with I believe more emotion and definitely more production. Rodriguez was over looked when in his prime, but now with the movie &#34;searching for sugerman&#34; being released, hopefully he will get he recognition he deserves...and the money....

B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Of course The Dark Knight was the best out of the three, overall. But The Dark Knight Rises did not disappoint... I'm a huge fan of Tom Hardy and was overwhelmed with anticipation to see him as Bane. He was scary as s***, powerful as all hell, and a true bastard - he, too, did not disappoint... Although I feel that the true show-stealer was Anne Hathaway, as Selina Kyle (not, Catwoman, as she was never referred to as such). She definitely made the character her own, while paying a subtle homage to Julie Newmar. JGL was also a brilliant choice to play the up-and-coming new masked crusader (whether it be Robin, Nightwing, or Batman, himself). As I viewed the film again, it was very enjoyable to watch the interactions between Wayne and Blake, and thinking of them as the dynamic duo.  I will admit, though, there were some holes in the story, or, perhaps, some things that I had missed or blew by me, that didn't, and still don't, sit well with me. But, being a dedicated fan and follower of all things Nolan (both Jonathan and Christopher), I will leave this as a solely positive review - I couldn't have made the film better myself, anyway... so who am I to judge...

B007THA4FI|4.0|A detailed, introspective story about the rich and the poor. The inward battle of a few select characters leads to both growth and tragedy. J.K. Rowling continues her excellent story telling although there is no comparison to be made to the Harry Potter series.

B000066AXE|5.0|Before watching this film I had no idea of what schizophrenia really was, how it was treated, or how an individual actually behaved  when in the throes of the disorder. A must see for anyone interested in psychology or who deals directly with patients!
B0077ATSSQ|4.0|I won't go into a detailed comparison of the movie versus the book, but typically I prefer books because they provide more detail and don't gloss over things like movies typically do. That was not the case with Extremely loud and incredibly close. I regret reading the book and wish I would have only watched the movie.<br /><br />The story starts out providing a brief glimpse of the relationship between young Oskar Schnell and his father Thomas. Thomas was unfortunate enough to be in the World Trade Center during the \\"worst day\\", leaving Oskar and his mom to deal with the loss of their loved one.<br /><br />One day while going through his dad's things, Oskar accidentally breaks a vase and finds a key inside of an envelope labelled \\"Black\\". He makes it his mission to find out what or who the key belongs in/to. His journey takes him all over New York. He walks to all of his locations due to his fear of public transportation.<br /><br />This movie is a definite tear jerker, putting you front and center at one of the worst events in recent US history. There are times when it is so deep and insightful that you can't help but be moved by it. Even though it starts out as a search to connect more with his father, Oskar ends up finding himself and extended family members along the way. Something he desperately needed but was not willing, or able, to admit.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|This album is great. &#34;Lights&#34; is very mainstream, so it's hard to appear hip when you like it, but if you name drop the other songs I feel like you get instant credibility amongst people who judge.

0525423656|4.0|Author: Ally Condie<br />Title: Crossed<br /><br />If you were in a Society that told you from birth, how to feel, what to eat, when you die wouldn't you want to escape? Crossed  the second book of a trilogy catches those emotions and describes piece by piece how you would survive. It is about a Girl named Cassia who has left the Society she was controlled by and her family which has been reassigned to the farmlands to find Ky the aberration boy she has fallen in love with. In this book the chapters are separated by Cassia's perspective and Ky's perspective as they try to find each other through the outer provinces. There is word of a Rising against the Society with also the threat of war with the outer provinces. Cassia and Ky both along their personal adventures are joined by Indie, Eli, and Vick who were sent to the outer provinces because they are aberrations or anomalies. Along the way they have decided to try and find the Rising in hopes of being able to start a life of their own with Cassia and Ky.<br /><br />The literary elements used in the books Matched & Crossed leaves you with no doubt that the author knows exactly what she wants to portray. The book's theme, science fiction, is based off of the way the Society collects their data, the airships they use, and how they control their member's emotions. There is a tone of wanting to be defiant, wanting to fight back and escape from the Society and be able to survive on your own. Within the tone there is the mood of each setting making you feel suspense, romantic wishes for Cassia and Ky. The imagery throughout the book has you dreaming of it in your sleep, it helps you be able to feel all the senses that arise. The characterization in this book has you feeling like it's a reality and you are taking  the journey with the crew, you are making alliances and you are trying to survive along with gaining a new future.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have got all my stuff that i need in it right now, the only complaint i have is that there could of been more velcro straps with it to secure lens, etc. from any movement. I went out and bought some extra velcro so all is well now. It's very comfortable on my shoulders and i that was something i was concerned about. Very good purchase and the price was good.

B0053VKP8S|4.0|I've purchased this for my sony ps3, so i could plug headphones and play the games through the night without disturbing neighbors or family members. It doesn't have built in headphone jack, so i bought separate 2 x RCA Male, 1 x 3.5mm Stereo Female, Y-Cable just for that reason. Works. Volume control is missing and sometimes it produces click sounds (once in a while though).<br /><br />Overall 4 stars. I'm quite happy with what it does. Would have been better if it supported other audio signal formats as well, not just PCM, if it had headphone jack and maybe a volume control?
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love this product. It has never let me down. Put all my important dates in it. Like the way it let's me set different alarms for different dates

B003SHYVO8|2.0|Entire &#34;Step Up&#34; franchise is something I approach as movie junk food/with low expectations, but first movie and Step Up Revolution were much better in my opinion, in terms of acting and dancing.  Not a fan of Briana Evigan - just got sucked into a holiday movie she did, and regretted that as well, think I will avoid her in the future.

0062127241|3.0|Never a Who fan, but love reading good rock bios (sex and drugs & rock and roll - yeah!), and I knew at the outset the Pete Townsend is one unusual dude.  Obviously, he's a very accomplished musician, but the more interesting part is Pete's personality.  Pete's always been a hostile dude.  Early on, got kicked in the pants by life and was angry thereafter. That's the short version.  The more complicated bits involve some bisexuality and public statements about knowing what it feels like to be a woman.  And of course, there's the child pornography charge.  Seems Pete admits he's long been comfortable with a bunch of guys, with the dominant male not being himself.  That's pretty ballsy stuff, and I admire him for being so out there.<br /><br />Like other reviewers have commented, Pete doesn't elaborate much about people or situations that call for closer analysis.  That's very frustrating.  As an early (Pink) Floyd fanatic, I would have loved a more fleshed out view of the London Underground, Syd Barrett and their club shows in general.  Was aware that Townsend had made dismissive remarks about hearing The Floyd live at UFO, but here he simply states \\"Syd Barrett was wonderful (how - personally or musically?), and that Roger Waters was strikingly handsome.\\"  (Most actually would judge the other way around.)  And perhaps, in Roger Waters he rightly detected an alpha male?  More importantly for Who fans, Townshend relays very little about Roger Daltrey, Keith Moon and John Entwistle.  Didn't he work along side these guys for like forever?  All Pete's observations are short and to the point, yet this autobiography extends beyond 500 pages.  There's a lot of facts:  we played here, I wrote that, had sex with him/her, took acid, drank a lot, stopped drinking, went back to drinking, etc.  Also, Townshend goes on and on about various musical projects he produced that never garnered much public attention.  Maybe they weren't that good?  That little fact doesn't seem to matter to Pete though.<br /><br />Started out this book having some admiration for Pete Townshend because he was always a punk at heart.  But by the time I finished this, I was totally alienated.  He never fails to mention what kind of studio equipment, boat or house he bought or what companies he started and owned and basically never stops honking his own horn.  His wife Karen gets short shrift, even though he cannot write anything bad about the woman who gave him all his children and stood by his side for many years, even through his various infidelities.  This is his last comment about her:  \\"[that she was] the rightful beneficiary of a rather splendid divorce settlement . . . \\"  Don't kill yourself.<br /><br />Considering that Pete Townshend has been a writer and even worked for a major publishing company, this tome amounts to one huge disappointment.to Pete though.<br /><br />Started out this book having some admiration for Pete Townshend because he was always a punk at heart.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you even remotely liked 50 Shades - you will love this series. I think this one is better than the first.<br />And it ends leaving me dying for the next one to come out. April is way too far away.
B009HELT3C|4.0|I never really loved the Men in Black movies but I certainly enjoyed watching them whenever they're on TV or something. This third film actually surprised me in a good way. Will Smith is cool as always, the actor playing Young K was pretty good, the aliens were creative and helped make for some creative action scenes. The villain is awesome! I loved Boris the Animal's make up and voice. The plot is good too, and actually had a pretty clever twist at the end. If you liked the other two, definitely check this one out.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|I received the Season 2 Next Generation blu-ray yesterday.  I have had the time to view several of the episodes.  I had read much about it and also read early reviews and looked at pre-release hi-def stills.  I am here to say that Season 2 looks amazing on blu-ray, just as Season 1 did, although the special effects work is not as consistently mind-blowing as it was for Season 1.  To my eye, many of the effects are just as good, but some are clearly inferior to Season 1.  However, this drawback hardly warrants a 1 star review for the overall release!  I challenge anyone to compare this release to the prior DVD release, and not see the vast improvement in video and audio quality.  In fact, much of the live action presentation looks absolutely gorgeous.  If you are a Star Trek fan on the fence about buying the set, I would highly recommend that you do, and that you not be dissuaded by 1 star reviews, nor by reviews of people who haven't even watched the episodes yet!  It is great and correct that Star Trek fans expect a lot from these blu-ray releases.  After all, many of us have already purchased these episodes in previous formats.  But in my opinion, this is well worth the new investment.<br /><br />In addition to the vastly improved picture and sound, the release includes a multitude of extras that are almost worth the cost of admission by themselves!  It also needs to be pointed out that each season of star trek is made up of individual episodes filmed by a variety of directors who make individual decisions about lighting and overall visual presentation.  It is not realistic to expect individual episodes to look exactly the same (e.g. some will be darker or more grainy in appearance than others).<br /><br />Finally, I would suggest looking at the reviews from Trekcore and blu-ray.com if you want a more detailed, and I think fair analysis, of the technical merits of this release.  I think those reviews are much more level-headed than some you will find from fans onAmazon.<br /><br />Like so many Star Trek fans, I feel like the best is yet to come, and I can't wait for Season 3.  But in the meantime, enjoy the Season 2 release for all it has to offer!
B00114RKT8|5.0|Learn about the events that abolished the transatlantic slave trade (but not slavery) in England well before the American Civil War. Amazing Grace depicts the fascinating parliamentary maneuverings led by William Wilbeforce that led to the demise of the profitable slave trade. The movie features a wonderful character role played by Albert Finney.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This book is a great addition to the other two 4 hour books. Great concept of using cooking as a metaphor for learning anything. Inspiring. I bought the kindle version. Am considering buying the full hardback as I would like to add it to my traditional book collection. Good work Tim.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I was looking for something that was sleek like the iPad cases you see. There are so many leather cases that the Kindle slides into that are bulky and cumbersome. This case is fitted to the Kindle; it just snaps around the outside. It protects the screen and body from scratches and has an elastic strap that hold the cover over the touch screen. The snugness of the cover keeps sand and dirt out. I could not be happier with the cover! It was relatively inexpensive, but will save my Kindle from wear and tear. If this one falls apart in a couple of years, I will definitely buy it again.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love this bible application.  I have tried many other bible applications and this one is by far my favorite.  I love how I can take notes and bookmark things with ease.  I would recommend this bible application to anyone of any age.

1400067820|1.0|He is a blatherskite - someone speaks or writes at great length and says almost nothing. I heard him on NPR for a 30 minute interview and then I listened to a hour talk he gave.<br /><br />I got interested so I started reading Antifragility. After grand statements that are easily shown to have great flaws I started to slow down in the muck and mire of his blather. I really was going to try to finish it but I was reminded of a movie review by Roger Ebert - I will never get those  two hours back but I wish to God I had not spent it with your movie ... or this book.<br /><br />Here are some of his assertions:<br />1. The corruption of large cities is avoided in smaller cities.  Really? check out Bell, California a town of less than 40,000 that has been called the most corrupt town in America. \\"City manager Robert Rizzo was earning $787,000.\\"<br />2. The smallest feasible unit of an organization makes it more antifragile. DUH!<br />Does he give any metric for how to discover what that is? No. He uses the example of an elephant being more fragile than a mouse. But, the largest organism in the world is a fungus occupying nearly 2,400 *acres*. Is that fragile? And, it is estimated to be between 2,400 and 8,650 years old. Big = Fragile? Pepsico is larger than Citigroup. Should it be broken up? If so, on what lines.<br />3. He says city-states were more antifragile that our current nation-states. If that were the case, we would still have the Holy Roman Empire with its approximately 300 entities in the current countries of Central Europe.<br />4. He says that there should be a balance between intervention and non-intervention in large companies. How? By what standards? I didn't find anything practical.<br />5. Out of nowhere, he insults the Office of Management and Budget for mistakes and does not explain what details he has. It is a wonder that the OMB produces anything because of the numerous accounting *systems* in the federal government. For example, a 2002 article stated that the Department of Defense alone had 674 separate computerized accounting, logistics and personnel systems.<br />6. He accuses university economic professors of being in an ivory tower. Well, that's fine, but did he mention that very few English professors are acclaimed novelists or that very few accounting professors have run major accounting firms.  Universities ARE ivory towers divorced from reality. You might as well accuse zoo lions from not catching many zebras.<br />7. Academia People Bad, Business People Good - As one of the other reviewers so aptly says: ... the author launches into lengthy diatribes against academia, which he \\"tried\\" but found university life filled with \\"petty obsessions, envy, and icy-cold hatreds.\\" He says that business, in contrast, \\"brings out the best in people...[and makes people] forgiving, honest, loving, and trusting.\\" Jeez, what a crock.
B006ZAZ31U|3.0|Remember the scene from &#34;Airplane&#34;, the movie, when Striker starts talking to the old lady sitting next to him? He starts out with when he was born, then the scene cuts away. When  they come back to that scene, the lady has hung herself because Striker is still babbling and has only progressed up to about the second grade. The first 8 chapters are like that. Fortunately, the last 7 chapters rock. Adam Brown was a true patriot and a hero. God bless him and his family.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|After reading part one, there was no doubt I was going to continue the ride to the end... This book was much more emotional than the first, book one was very raw and sexually frustrating and book two pulled more at the heart strings.... loved this book very much....
B008XNZMOU|1.0|I'm appalled.  Been a fan of hers since the beginning.  This album, while loaded with Taylor's usual catchy lyrics, is appallingly over-produced.  Autotune?  Really Taylor?  I'm not opposed at all to pop tunes, but most of the songs here are pretty much what you get from the Disney Clones - certainly not what I expect from a consummate songwriter like Taylor Swift.<br /><br />My verdict: skip this one and hope for better next year.

I feel in love instantly with Christian Grey and his 50 shades of all F'ed up... he intrigued me and sent shivers down my spine in every scene he was in... The most fun part of this book was the email interaction between the main characters and the romance building between a gorgeous young male and the awkward young female that lead us on a journey of love, lust, sex and romance.... loved this book and always will.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Really good story that keeps you in suspense, interested all the way and I want to read the next one.
B002PJN59M|4.0|Tremendous film with lots of legendary imagery. Cleverer than it's given credit for. People criticise the unrealistic armour for the dark ages, and the stylised production, but it's a projection of the fully evolved myth as later medieval folk might have envisaged it. Impossible to have more appropriate and inspiring music, all part of the Germanic mythological world which Wagner wrote for.<br />Other highlights for me: Uther Pendragon copulating with Igraine in full plate armour, and the special effects of a red light bulb for the setting sun!<br />My only real criticism's are a weak Arthur, but I could appreciate the challenge of showing a chraracter develop from dithering peasant to great King. Also, I'm not quite sure if Nicol Williamson was a trifle too eccentric in his portrayal of Merlin! The movie is great fun, if you suspend reality - it is a 'myth', after all.
0547884591|5.0|The Four Hour Chef has been an excellent read. As I read it I feel as though I am taking my own personal learning/ cooking class. Tim has clearly thought through the organization and layout of this book.  Honestly if my textbooks were anything like The 4-Hour Chef, I probably would have done better in school.  Finally, the recipes are simple, delicious and far healthier than the traditional cooking, I am a particular fan of the scrambled eggs.  Thank you for making eggs exciting again. Bravo, Tim, Bravo!
B009HELT3C|3.0|I expected more out of Will Smith.  Maybe they should've paid him more.  It wasn't as many laughs as it should've been.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|The movie was great and my granddaughter can actually watch it.  But I rented it in &#34;standard&#34; instead of &#34;HD&#34; and the quality and resolution sucked.  It was hard to watch.  Before when I rented Standard movies from Amazon they were better quality.  What is going on????
0547884591|4.0|I could easily write a review that rivals the length of Tim's encyclopedia, entitled the \\"4 Hour Chef\\"...oh...what's that...it's just one book...it's not just about cooking?...I don't have to read the entire thing?<br /><br />Perfect!<br /><br />As an avid Tim fan back from 2008, I was excited to see this book come out. It is great in a way that it makes understanding the culinary arts simple and lets me feel like I have a pair between my legs. I am only about 1/3 of the way through the book but have already been putting the concepts to good use in the kitchen and on the grill, which my girlfriend loves. Then, I have to refer back to a particular chapter in Tim's \\"4 Hour Body\\" to maintain this high level of excellence in the bedroom as well.<br /><br />Minus one star for the book being too cooking-centric. The 4HWW and 4HB had a wide array of lessons independent of each other and while this book followed the same path, it appears that 90% of the book is on cooking. This apparently upsets people that wanted a 100% pure cookbook, but I was hoping for a little more diversity. Either way, I'm still a true fan. Thank you Mr. Ferriss.

B000006IUQ|1.0|If you're looking for 16x9 widescreen, DONT buy this. Its 2:35 letterbox, meant for standard 4x5 tv. I have tried twice now to order the other wide screen version that says \\" widescreen edition\\" on the cover and has different artwork. Both times I was sent this aweful letterbox version. So beware...these vendor employees who pack and ship the orders are completely ignorant about film aspect. Good luck getting a true widescreen disc.

B002SAUCBC|3.0|Stephen King is always a masterful storyteller, and it would be unfair to say that I didnt enjoy this story. It drew me in, and kept my interest. However, the ending left me wanting to know more...I know we are supposed to fill in the &#34;blank&#34; ourselves, and its fairly obvious what the outcome is, but it just didnt feel very satisfying to me...wanted a little more from the author. Having said that. I would still recommend it as a good read.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Again this one  got for the kids. They enjoy trying to beat the different levels with the most stars. Keeps them happy on rainy days.

B005LAIHZY|5.0|My children and I went to see this when it was in theaters and immediately my daughter stated she wanted it when it came out for personal sale.

It arrived quickly and in excellent condition.<br /><br />This is going to make a great &#34;santa&#34; gift!

B002ZG980U|2.0|Coming off the heels of The Dark Knight, people were obviously psyched for Christopher Nolan's Inception. It's a story about a team which goes into peoples' dreamscapes, and is able to distort the fabric of their dreams to the point of being able to plant new ideas within their heads. At the same time, The Dark Knight had a great focus on action and excitement, which is poor course for the cerebral and oftentimes random flights taken in dreams. Nolan could have chosen between an action thriller or something akin to Satoshi Kon. He chose the former and it shows.<br /><br />The main character is Dom Cobb, who is so good at altering dreams, he's something of a mercenary. After getting into trouble with a prominent Japanese businessman, Saito, he is offered the job of altering the idea of a rival businessman so as to close down the company, and Cobb accepts. He enlists the help of his team, with a young college student named Ariadne. However Cobb clearly has more pressing issues at hand, that manifest themselves in the dreamscape while going to work on other peoples' dreams, and the movie is essentially about him confronting his demons.<br /><br />Right from the start, you can tell this is not going to be a movie about the actual concept of dreaming. The premise of the plot is wholly complicating a rather simple idea to begin with. If you want to screw with a businessman, get incriminating evidence, plant incriminating evidence, or put some moles in his company. There is no reason to get a team of people to screw with his head and have an entire movie where not much happens except a guy resolves his issues in the way that would happen in a therapist's office, with none of the chaos and grief that confronting your issues usually involves. When the paradigm of a movie is large and grandiose, but everything that's happens is so pitifully mundane where everything could be replaced by much smaller happenings and have the same results in characterization and story events, there is a clear problem.<br /><br />The movie is restricted to either action sequences, or boring exposition filler that explains how the team infiltrates someone's dream, right down to explaining dumb gadgets and the like. The main dream is nothing more than a flimsy excuse for a glorified action sequence, all because the target happened to watch a security video prior, and tons of exposition and tech talk about dreams within dreams. The only thing remotely related to real dreaming is how people can sometimes go to sleep in their own dreams and have a dream within a dream, or the way in which architectural geometry does not have to make sense. Aside from that, this is a movie with pretty people wearing suits in the city. If you want to have a look at real dreams, go to sleep.<br /><br />The characters' names are not really so much names, as they are randomly assigned epithets at having double meaning and symbolism. Characterization is entirely devoted to one note quirks and the same characters teasing each other over nothing, in order to show these guys are friends, but nothing deeper than their role in the plot is really established. The only character with any deep significance is Cobb with the latent issues that manifest in his dreams, and even that's undeveloped, with the sole issues of his dreams being a recurring femme fatale with a gun. In a movie where every dream is a dumb action scene with people gunning at the characters, it falls flat. There's some random stuff at the end which devotes itself to puzzling the viewer if anything was real, or if the whole thing was all a dream, yet in a film where there's so little at stake and the whole questioning of reality is based on something as obvious as dreams, and not any psychoses of the main characters, nothing is really added to the narrative as a result.<br /><br />Ultimately the problem here is that nothing in this movie is anywhere close to an exploration of dreams. There are free for download 16-bit indie games made in Japan made with cheapo RPGMaker programs focused on the very ideas of dreaming, unfolding the latent issues to the dreamer, and playing out in exactly the disorderly fashion that dreams do. Here with Inception, all you have is a multimillion dollar popcorn thriller that only tangentially uses the idea of dreams as an excuse for the plot to be about something, but is clearly all about action, and does not care for its ideas, even its story, in the slightest.<br /><br />At the risk of being inappropriate, none of the characters ever experience any emissions or bladder problems after their dreams. No need to take a piss afterwards, nothing at all. I wondered if the characters were even people, but then I realized, they had to be robots. Of course! Now I get why the fourth-wall question is asked at the end. The audience is the dreamer and they're the ones who clearly had to go to the lieu in the movie theater after guzzling soda and stuffing popcorn down their throats. Now I get it. Inception is the deepest movie ever.
B009JBZH54|5.0|LOVE THIS BOX SET!! It has tons of extras and it look GREAT!! I would def recommend this box set to any batman fan...
B008JDAC7G|5.0|So much fun to play! What really makes the game is the music and animation presented. You can spend hours swiping houses off of a stack while monsters eat them in front of you.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|First game I ever played on my new Kindle.  It was easy to understand and play.  Now I know  why my grandson likes to play Angry Birds
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very fun it also is hard because you have to use the points you get when you win a game to buy other games so you have a challenge.
0316228532|4.0|I always loved the H Potter books because JK Rowling's voice is so matter-of-fact and unpretentious. This book is not a fantastical thriller. I was able to set the book down, yet I was intrigued enough to continue. When one considers that the entire story takes place in a small, seemingly boring down, it is amazing that the author succeeds in showing the reader that small is anything but boring.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|add me on GL so we can help each other earn heart jems  Hattori_Saya<br /><br />it is a cute game to play every now and then.
B0000A0DRY|3.0|Only interesting because of Grace Slick's vocals. The rest is predictable 60's. Good for historical value and cheap enough. A journey through time.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I know the tiles are traditional but where it's not too difficult to distinguish the tiles on a laptop or PC, on a tablet it's hard to differentiate them.  Also, it's difficult to tell that some tiles are actually overlapped by a different tile so would have to &#34;try them&#34; ony to find out they didn't have free sides.  So, too much concentrating to be relaxing.  Plan to uninstall it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I would not classify myself as a &#34;zombie lover&#34;. I don't read books about zombies or watch a lot of horror movies but I love Walking Dead. There is depth to the characters, the scenario is somewhat realistic, and of course, the show is suspenseful. WATCH IT!
B004I9CXHW|1.0|ordered this for connecting my mp3 player to audi music interface, but this is not usb, it is iphone 30 pin. so not specified product.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This Fantasy book is very interesting. No \\"Kiddo stuff\\" though...There's quite a lot of very descriptive (the whole book is)  violence, cruelty and sex in it. Even though these are handled masterfully, I would grade it \\"adults only\\". Not for narrow-minded souls either. All sorts of \\"characters\\" in it, men women, young and old, besides the animals and various \\"creatures\\" and monsters...My personal favorite character is \\"Tyrion\\" the dwarf...So witty, just, clever and valiant!..You some times forget he is so very ugly...(unfair, really).<br /><br />I had my doubts to buy it  from other (very judgmental) reviewers, but as it turns out the reading of this book is very easy. Problem free. Also, as opposed to magazines, on this book (my first on my kindle) I can adjust the font size to a very comfortable one. I love the \\"dictionary\\"  feature, since many words belong to \\"ancient-English\\" and there's no 'guess-work' as there was with Book one and two (paper back  version). I am considering getting the whole collection.

B001N1DPDE|4.0|First off, I am not really a LARGE knife fan, and this is a LARGE knife. I do like Ka-Bar knives and have several including my favorite, the MK1 USN. I usually tend to gravitate towards the MoraKniv style (I have many of these). Having said that, I am finding this knife quite useful and I am learning to appreciate it more and more (After a few modifications). The reason for 4 stars instead of 5? The sheath's belt loop strap is pure junk IMO, and I am not real comfortable with the feel of the Grivory scales or the heavy black blade coating. So, I removed the original strap and replaced it with a TekLok, stripped the blade with Citristrip, polished and applied a forced Patina. I have not decided what to do about the scales yet. This thing is coming around to my liking nicely. I realize that not everyone will want to make these mods but even without them, you will have a heavy duty field knife that takes and holds a good edge. With my mods I think it will be a 5 star performer for me. It performs all the tasks of a good camp/ outdoor knife. Chops well, slices well (without coating), and believe it or not, makes some mean curls on a feather stick. I am sure it would baton well for those that would use it in that manner. I generally would only do this if I lost my camp axe. AND... for the price, &#60; $65.00, you can't go wrong. Another great knife from Ka-Bar.
030759565X|3.0|I love the blog and had a great time seeing Deb Perelman on her book tour, where I was crazy enough to pay MORE than the list price for the book. There are some great-looking recipes in this book, most of which are not on the website, and I look forward to trying many of them, starting with the apple cider caramels. It is definitely not a 'basics' cookbook. The recipes, although fairly simple, are unusual. Personally I like this because I already have many cookbooks coving the basics. My so-so rating has more to do with the format of the book. As another reviewer noted, recipes run 3-4 pages of prose, so the actual steps to the recipe are hard to pick out, and most of the time they are not on the same page as the ingredients, so you have to flip back and forth as you cook. Also, a pet peeve of mine with cookbooks, there is no table of contents or index listing the recipes with page numbers, so while you can see in the beginning of the book that sweets start on p. 193, when you get to page 193 there is no indication of which page 'cakes' starts on. After you shuffle through 90 pages of sweets to find that cakes start on p. 238, you have to shuffle some more to find the recipe for 'chocolate hazelnut crepe cake' on p. 256. It would have been so simple to put a page number next to each recipe on the list. Also, the pictures aren't labeled and since they frequently aren't on the same page as the title of the recipe, you have to go back to see what you're looking at and whether that's the recipe you're looking for. More flipping around. I'm surprised, with her attention to detail and frequent reading of other cookbooks, that this book is so clunky.

B008CP6RWU|5.0|Game: Journey [PS3]<br /><br />Rating: 5/5 {excellent}<br /><br />I just earned my white cloak {read: Transcendence trophy} after several consecuctive play throughs of this adorable gem.  It's very rare for a game to inspire multiple iterations, but this game succeeds.<br /><br />In my first journey, I started off with the usual gamer goal of learning the basics of the game (which turned out to be stunningly easy), but after finishing the first two segments in short order I ran into my first fellow traveler, and the essential core of the game quickly became apparent ... simple wordless companionship and cooperation.  No pretentious gamer names, no personality mismatches or generation gaps, no tiresome messaging or voice-overs, no weapons, no overly complicated abilities, no overly-tedious puzzles ... just simple, sublime cooperation.  {Aside: you don't actually NEED to cooperate, but the experience is 10x more satisfying if you do, and the ability to recharge each others rune scarves is a helpful boon).<br /><br />Art wise, the game has a somewhat abstract Peruvian/Andean flair, with Shintoist overtones, and I was reminded strongly of an episode of \\"Beyond Survival with Les Stroud\\" called \\"The Q'Ero - Descendants of the Inkan High Priests\\" [...] (highly recommended, BTW) in which Les Stroud completes a sacred pilgrimage through the Andes mountains with an Andean holy man. For fellow literary buffs, I recommend \\"Johnathan Livingston Seagull\\" by Richard Bach (and the fabulous soundtrack of the same by Neil Diamond) ... the overall flavor is similarly satisfying.<br /><br />A few minor nits:<br />* At the conclusion of a journey, the game lists the other players you met during your journey.  I wish the game did so BEFORE the painfully looooong scroll of credits. Yawn.<br /><br />* I have mixed feelings about the game's length, which is rather short (2-3 hrs) - on the one hand, part of me agrees with others that it's the perfect length AS IS; and on the other hand, part of me wishes it were 1-2 hrs longer and just a wee bit more challenging.<br /><br />Bottom line: what a wonderful, relaxing, pseudo-spiritual game ... highly recommended, for those introspective souls out there who understand the values of patience, silence, and the quiet joys of simply BE-ing.of me wishes it were 1-2 hrs longer and just a wee bit more challenging.<br /><br />Bottom line: what a wonderful, relaxing, pseudo-spiritual game ... highly recommended, for those introspective souls out there who understand the values of patience, silence, and the quiet joys of simply BE-ing.

B00846REIS|5.0|A lot like fifty shades, loved it though had some differences like the characters and the story line, but basically the same.
1936608898|5.0|Well-written and very informative. I couldn't put this book down!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who is thinking about improving their diet or changing the way they eat. Good tips for how to be successful, and many different ideas for meals and food combinations.<br /><br />The book is written in a very straightforward manner; it is not very &#34;science-y&#34;. HOWEVER, there are many references and the explanations are sound.<br /><br />It's a good read, and it certainly inspired me to change the way I eat and try out the Whole30.

B004I8WD6E|4.0|I really like the case cover. I dropped my phone and it did a good job protecting it. Its not bulky and I would order it again. The delivery was pretty fast too. I tried hard to like the protective glass cover but it kept peeling at the edges and had lots of air bubbles so i eventully just took it off and threw it away.

B008JEJPSC|1.0|When in the 80's I saw Peter Graves use those little laser discs to find out about their new Mission:Impossible, I thought that was great new technology. A few years later audio CDs arrived in Portugal. When DVDs started to come out, I found out what a great picture quality compared to the old VHS tapes. And the possibility of watching a movie with English subtitles was a great way to learn English and to understand the picture much better than any language translation because there are expressions which just can't be translated. Either you understand it or you don't.<br /><br />Now with Blu-Ray, the movie companies go to every effort to force the consumer to buy the same movies again, after have bought them on VHS, DVD, DVD Special Edition. They make new special features, new cover designs, new commentaries, new everything but they forget Europe is in a economic crisis and even if we are SOOOOOO tempted to buy our favorite movies with the BEST picture and sound quality available, we just CAN'T! Us the portuguese have no money and no way to get it. The Wizard of Of of course is one of those classics, as well as Willy Wonka, Annie, Indiana Jones, Back to the Future, the Bond movies, etc etc etc. The list is endless.<br /><br />And even if we could buy it, somewhere in the future a new medium will be invented (probably a microchip) with 2K or 4K resolution of those movies. I think we have to draw the line somewhere, people. Come on. Be serious. The minimum wage here is 480 Euros. A Blu-Ray costs between 10 and 40 Euros.<br /><br />We love movies also but we just can't...

She can also talk to Ben and he will repeat it back to her. It keeps her engaged for quite awhile and this is saying something for a 19 month old.
B009SQRC9E|4.0|Cute movie, the kids loved it, and if I am honest, I enjoyed it to! It is nice to have a movie that we could all enjoy together. Nothing to edit out on this one even for our youngest (3). It was a good watch!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It was a fun read and kept me captivated for the most part but at times it read like an airport bestseller. I was interested in the plot with a murdered judge but the book took a shift with a twist that wasn't well developed and I was a little confusing and when it was explained it was a bit predictable. Had some memorable writings and was cool that the hero was an African-American man. I would've liked a more believable ending

I had experienced a TIA but I didn't know how the mind worked when it came to repairing itself. Physicians don't have enough time to educate us; their job is repair. Chapters 2-3 deal with how the mind functions. Those chapters are not an easy read for the non-science person, but if you want to know what happened to you, where it happened, the mechanism for it, then you've got to take on those chapters. The rest of the book retells in easy language how she persevered and how her mother stepped in and never gave up on her. So you have a lot of stories in one, all of them telling us, from different vantage points, how to work on repair and how to deal with a problem that none of us ever expected to have. Only downside: too much recovery detail at times, but a little skimming here and there will get you through.

B007Z9QBXY|3.0|I enjoyed much  about this movie, but wondered why on earth the decision was made to juxtapose a modern love story over the &#34;Story of the Century?&#34; I loved the scenes with Wallis and Edward, and resented the modern story as it took away from what was truly captivating. It was well-filmed, but left me feeling empty and wanting more of the Royals.

B004YM6JI2|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Supernatural for a long time now. I have been watching the show on TNT, but they keep showing seasons 1 through 6 over and over. I was unable to watch the show on it's regular night and time, so I was stuck watching the same episodes repeat themselves.<br /><br />I have already purchased seasons 1 through 6, so I needed season 7 to complete my collection. When season 8 comes out, I will do it again.
B0085RQLXK|1.0|This album is really hard to get through. Lots overproduced over arranged songs that go on and on. It starts with a really cool lick on the first song but falls apart with the repetition and overdone arrangements and songs. There is no band feel to the record. It is the producers record along with Steven Tyler the band is more like hired studio musicians to add a little rock n roll to the pop feel. Lots of big punchy  chorus' they repeat over and over with lots of fluff around it.<br /><br />Aerosmith has always had a unique way of arranging songs. When it works it's really cool but when it doesn't it's really hard to get through. Lots of long overdone songs. Nothing straightforward. If in Guantanamo Bay they need some repetitive sounds to torture the inmates just put this record on it would get 'em to talk.<br /><br />When Aerosmith had a hit with the terrible song \\"Angel\\" it created a conflict of who they were. They balanced it well up to the record Pump but since then they just overdo everything. And make really bad pop ballads their thing. They did a blues album a few years ago and it was overdone not straightforward too. Just get in a room and play. Too much fussing and arranging not enough straight up rockin'. Get [[ASIN:B0000029AL Aerosmith]], [[ASIN:B0000029AP Toys in the Attic]], or even [[ASIN:B00005QEO0 Permanent Vacation]] (\\"St. John\\" rocks!). Anything Pump back to their first is worth getting.<br /><br />There are four good songs, in my opinion. \\"Something\\", \\"Freedom Fighter\\", \\"Street Jesus\\" and \\"Can't Stop Loving You\\". Really nice catchy ballad in \\"Can't Stop Loving You\\" but not really an Aerosmith song more like Steven Tyler guesting on another singers record. \\"Something\\" and \\"Street Jesus\\" cool rockers. \\"Freedom Fighter\\" has a Warren Zevon feel lyrically and singing wise, cool song. But the rest just really hard to get through.  Just my take as a fan. Rock On !!!

The guy makes uncomplicated argument and good sense in his arguments against grain products, but living in a rural area in Scandinavian makes the deletion of grain products from the diet very difficult. I am following his advice closely as possible, I have lost 2 pounds in 3 weeks. I am pretty sure i can keep them and hopefully shed a few more as I try to stick to his recommendations.<br />There are recipes to help get you started in the right direction. Give up believing in diet pills and bite into the glutenfree truth!
B002PL8SWY|5.0|How can I not rate my favorite Stones album other than 5.  I would give it a 10 if there were more stars.  Every thing else in this package is an added bonus if you are a fan.  But if you are just getting into the Stones, this is a great album to start, but buy the album on its own.  The music speaks for itself.  But if you have the extra money, this is a great purchase for the reason of the extra Stones songs not found in the original album and BB King and Tina Turner songs.  BB's backing band is in tip top shape and Tina's vocals are outstanding.
B002V6RB1C|3.0|Good classic movie. My son used it for completing a portion of a boy scout merit badge. Paul Newman was a driving force in the prison and influenced all

0143034901|4.0|This book was a fun read.  It's kind of like Umberto Eco lite with a dash of Borges thrown in.  It definitely has a cheez quality to it and is extremely sentimental, but to good effect because it actually caused me to squirt some tears at the end.  The characters are all very melodramatic but it all fits in with the quality of the world he creates.<br /><br />I must say some of the scenes had me on the edge of my reading chair at times, so it is not without it's thrills.  I would read this author again.

B007RTAR64|5.0|Got this for a Christmas present so I can't attest to the happiness from the child's point-of-view yet but the doll itself is wonderful.  The only problem is that my older daughter wanted this so I ordered it for her but the younger one saw a picture of the Katniss Doll in a magazine this morning and exclaimed &#34;this is EXACTLY what I've been trying to tell you that I want!&#34;  Now - to buy a second one or not?...
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Couldn't put it down - the intertwining of a &#34;murder-mystery&#34; with a psychological, romantic drama - brilliant. Loved the uncertainty that was constantly put into the story making you want to keep reading to find out what truly happened. Great book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved loved loved how unpredictable the plot was.  Enjoyed the writing style and thought it well done.<br /><br />Talked my husband into reading it as well and he also enjoyed it.<br /><br />For the nay sayers who are complaining about the ending - WHAT ELSE COULD IT POSSIBLY BE??  With the characters' traits I thought it completely fitting albeit unusual for the reader's expectations.  Life isn't always tidy eh?<br /><br />Enjoy!

1118156315|5.0|This book is a fantastic framework for individuals to leverage to assess their \\"business\\" value chain - what resources do you have, what are your goals, how do you reach out and connect with people - what are you communicating? I highly recommend this book given its step by step approach and also the mix of simplicity and complexity in the framework. The one pager is an amazing tool to add to your career development toolkit.
B009IU6N5Y|3.0|In what's kinda like Ken Burns \\"The Civil War\\" meets INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE (plus some MATRIX thrown in for good measure), Russian director Timur Bekmambetov's ABRAHAM LINCOLN VAMPIRE HUNTER is just plain fun.<br /><br />Everything is well done in this film, starting with the cast.  Ben Walker as Abraham Lincoln is just great.  Unlike some other actors of his generation, Walker never seems aware that he's in a giant movie playing a part.  He just is Honest Abe - he plays the part simply and without trying \\"act\\" like he's the Railsplitter.  A very fine performance.  His vampire hunter trainer, played by Dominic Cooper (prolly best know as playing Tony Stark's Dad in CAPTAIN AMERICA) is also excellent... as is Rufus Sewell and the 'Head vampire\\" and pretty much everyone else in the cast.  Very good acting all around.<br /><br />Ditto that the photography and costumes and SFX.  In fact, there is a simply fantastic scene where Lincoln must fight a vampire in a stampede of horses - amazing SFX.  The music is good, not great, but certainly serviceable.  The movie looks and feels like a big budget film (which of course it is), and it looks like the money is put up on the screen.<br /><br />As for the vampires themselves, for the most part they don't seem all that vampire-ish - they can move freely during the day, turn invisible, and other rarely seen tricks - but they are consistent within their own mythos, and make a very nice set of villains.<br /><br />And as much as this movie is about steampunk kung fu scenes against vampires, it really is about Lincoln himself.  There's one shot of him walking in silhouette down a hallway that sent chills up my spine.  In the end, it is a story about Lincoln, arguably the best President this great country has ever produced - plus some vampires.  And that's pretty dang sweet.  The story does a nice job of intertwining the real man with the fantastical story (basically keeping the facts of Lincoln's life accurate), making for one of the more original movies you're likely to see this year.  There are some elements of tale that perhaps could have been told better - it tends to minimize slavery and paint white Southerners with large evil brush - but it is after all a story about Abe Lincoln killing vampires.<br /><br />In the end, it's a neat version of the story of a great man plus an army of vampires - what's not to like?<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: 3.5 4 score and 40 dead vampires out of 5
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have always believed in a continuation of this life in some form.  Without it life makes no sense to me.  Two years ago my 22 year old grandson died.  It was sudden and tragic.  My faith was shaken but still somewhere in my mind I still believed.  I kept thinking that we have a heart and a brain within our body but we can't really feel all that we feel with a physical organ.  I know nothing about science at all but this thought kept going through me....that our &#34;feelings&#34; and our &#34;love&#34; are not really things we can see or touch so that they must go on....  I also appreciated the sense of love and God that Dr. Alexander talked about and appreciated that he didn't tie this to a particular religion.  While I do have a certain religion I do not believe that there is only one way to get to God...or Om or this place of unconditional love. This book was a tremendous help to me.  I also went to a &#34;medium&#34; and there is no way she could have put me in touch with my grandson if she wasn't authentic.  Thank you Dr. Alexander.
B005LAIHCM|3.0|HATE is a fun thriller aimed primarily at teens.  Plot's pretty standard fare - a teenager girl (Jennifer Lawrence) and her bitchy mom (Elisabeth Shue) move to an upscale neighborhood populated by uptight douches (in the parlance of our times).  We find out in the first 5 minutes that they could only afford the house because the was a gruesome double murder next store - a young girl murdered her parents in cold blood.  The girl escaped without ever being found... and is of course rumored to haunt the nearby woods.<br /><br />The killer's younger brother (wonderfully played by Max Thieriot), who only survived because he was at his aunt's house at the time of the murders, has moved back into the old house.  Soon, the girl and boy meet and hit it off.  Mom doesn't like the kid, and neither do most of the townies, but he's a sweetheart.  All of this pretty much spelled out in the trailer.  The film, while not terribly stylistic (if you had to take a shot for every \\"Dutch angle\\" you'd soon be very drunk), is well done enough that we care about what's happening.  The acting is quite good by all (Jennifer Lawrence proves that she's not just a hot chick with a bow and arrow) and the music doesn't club you over the head.<br /><br />HATE isn't a horror movie so much as it's a thriller and teen melodrama.  It largely succeeds at both goals, and I'm sure younger teen viewers would dig this film a lot.  You see - and again this is in the trailer - the boy is taking care of his deranged sister.  Weird and kinda spooky, but it definitely establishes the boy as a caring guy - you can see why another lonely person would like him.  Great and all, but after about 65-70 minutes, I started looking at my watch as teen melodramas aren't exactly my cup of tea anymore.  Basically, I was starting to hate HATE...<br /><br />Well it's right about then that HATE kicks it into overdrive, making some balls out moves that immediately take the film in an entirely different direction.  I guessed what was going to happen, but only about 2 minutes before it did happen.  Not too shabby for a flick like this.  I'd say more, but think of this as a sort of horror version of CRYING GAME (and in fact, Stephen Rea actually has a cameo in the film) where the plot twists really are half the movie.  So while it's not great - there are some mighty big continuity errors and gaps of logic - the film tries to cover it's bases, and a well acted original story is always welcome.  Don't run out to see it, but see it before someone ruins the end for you.  Critics have hated this film, but on this one, believe the 80% plus audience approval rate.  It's a good flick.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  3.5 First there are kisses then there are knives out of 5
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan has done it again - what a voice!  sometimes after the first horrah you think the next one won't be as good, but the producers and Susan gave a good performance.
B009AMALGM|3.0|While the 4th film in the PARANAORNAL ACTIVITY series hasn't quite yet jumped the shark, the producers should think strongly about moving the story significantly forward for 5 if they want to keep milking this cash cow.<br /><br />Basically, 4 is a remake of 3 but with a different family and a Xbox Kinect - seriously, this movie is nearly infomercial for the wireless game system.  The found footage gimmick still works, but because we've seen this all before - three times before - the technique is starting to lose some of its power.  It doesn't help things when the character who sets up all the computers (it's computer cameras recording all the scares this time) has a harrowing near death experience that's all recorded - then doesn't watch the footage.<br /><br />So what's the point?<br /><br />Perhaps because this is the weakest of the 4 movies, the fact that we're never shown exactly who has found all this footage becomes a real letdown.  These films try their best to pretend that it's all real (no title sequence for instance), and that's all well and good - but seriously, 4 films in and we still don't know who's edited all this footage together and put titles on it?  This, plus barely moving the actual storyline ahead a wink, left me wondering what was the point of this film other then making a fast buck?  I mean, we get it - there's a demon/ghost about and a coven of witches that has summoned it - but what's their ultimate goal (other then daring the fools who record all the footage to put it on youtube); why are they risking possible exposure by killing a well to do family in an upscale neighborhood?  What's the grand plan?  PARANORMAL 4 gives us not a clue.<br /><br />Ironic as the poster claims that \\"All the activity has led to this.\\"<br /><br />It's the repetitive nature of this film and near total lack of new story that kills any real power to scare.  In fact all most all the scares are of the cheap shock variety, not close to the hair raising terror the other 3 movies possessed.  Why not have the new victims be poor or black or English?  Anything else other then yet another yuppie white family living in a giant mansion with a huge staircase in the Southwest.  While 5 promises a change of pace, it comes one movie too late.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: 3 now I want a Xbox Kinect too out of 5 stars

B009YQJ322|4.0|What can I say besides that I loved it - DREDD 3d is DIRTY HARRY/MAGNUM FORCE and BLADERUNNER all wrapped up into one yummy package of ultra-violence.  DREDD takes place in some post-apocalyptic future where there is only one massive city left, and that city is (barely) kept sane by a force of super cops who dispense justice with the barrel of a gun.  When Dredd and his rookie cop partner are called to the toughest ghetto in the city, all hell breaks loose.  Taking place in one massive building, the plot to DREDD is every cop's worst nightmare and it meant that the tension never stopped growing throughout the film.<br /><br />Karl Urban - as usual - is great as Dredd.  That he can play Bones McCoy to a tee one minute in STAR TREK, then the ass kicking Dredd the next is amazing.  Somehow even with a helmet on the whole time, he manages to tough and funny at the same time.  Just a great performance.<br /><br />The production value was top notch - the music (Paul Leonard-Morgan) was great, the gore was great, the tone great, costumes great, and the direction (Pete Travis) rock solid.  Just about one of the grittiest, toughest ass scifi action films ever made.  As in DIRTY HARRY tough.<br /><br />Speaking of HARRY, there's some wonderful tributes to MAGNUM FORCE, both in terms of plot and music.  And stealing from/paying tribute to MAGNUM FORCE is all right in my book.  All in all, it's one of the must see movies of 2012.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  4 \\"It's judgment time\\" stars out of 5

B009HEJXFS|3.0|Well, it's most of the MIB clan back together (Rip Torn must have lots of money - or wanted too much of it) for this 3rd installment of the now 15 yr-oldish franchise.<br /><br />The first movie was goofy as hell, but had a lot of charm - most of which came from snappy dialogue and the chemistry between Tommy Lee Jones and the then relatively new to the big screen Will Smith.  Fast forward 15 years and the chemistry is still sorta there, although any sort of freshness from the writing or basic story has long gone stale.  The first quarter of this newest movie isn't very good - bad jokes, a disinterested Jones (Tommy Lee just there for the check it seems), and a lost looking Smith don't make for cinematic gold.<br /><br />Things do pick up a bit when Josh Brolin (as a younger Tommy Lee) finally arrives on the scene as Smith travels back in time.  These two have more of the chemistry you remember Smith and Jones having in the original.  Brolin's just great as Jones - at times, it's was hard to tell if it was Tommy Lee doing ADR, or just a great impersonation by Brolin (it's all Brolin).<br /><br />Nothing very original about the script and almost every opportunity for some jokes about the racism of the '60's are just passed up.  The only set of jokes based on the fact that Smith is a black super cop from the future are the most obvious kind (he gets pulled over in a stolen car).  Too bad, because with Smith, there could have been some very good BLAZING SADDLES moments - none of which are allowed to happen.<br /><br />As it is, it's kinda cute when they go back to the late 1960's (although the time period actually feels more 1950's), and we get to see Bill Hader as Andy Warhol.  There's a surprising amount of sentimentality near the end of this film - as though Barry Sonnenfeld knows this is the last ride on this particular spaceship - and it proves to be this film's saving grace in what is otherwise a very bland and corporate flick.<br /><br />It's fun enough to checkout for MIB fans.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  3 Brolin rules outta 5
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I went to the pictures to see this movie and when I saw it advertised on Amazon I had to buy it, pleased that it arrived a week early and will watch it with the family on our weekly movie night. Thank you Amazon.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Part ALIEN VS PREDATOR and part Chariots of the Gods, PROMETHEUS is a beautiful but convoluted mess of a movie that manages to breath a tiny bit of life into an old franchise, but not much else.<br /><br />The plot - which is more or less explained in the trailers - is fairly simple:  80 years into the future scientists find evidence that aliens have been to earth - and that they've left a clue as to where to meet them.  Naturally, we go to find out what all the cave drawings are about and predictably, things go terribly wrong.<br /><br />Considering that PROMETHEUS is set in the ALIEN universe (something that only the newest trailers even admit to), nearly every ALIEN fan will immediately recognize the similarities - the alien world, a morally corrupt robot, a large corporation with it own designs, and lots of space ship stuff (both alien in nature and human).  Which is all well and good, but somehow returning director Ridley Scott and writers Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof still manage to step on their dicks, despite a massive budget and familiar stomping grounds.<br /><br />The plot is simple, which is fine (it is a prequel to a movie who's sole original purpose was to have someones chest explode from the inside out after all), but so are the characters - all very one dimensional, very flat.  Some of that's because it's just not a great cast - the \\"Ripley\\" type character is played by Noomi Rapace who is a fine actor, but simply doesn't have either the charisma or physique to pull off her role in this film.  Other roles are just as flat.  Ironically, only Michael Fassbender as the robot is interesting in the slightest.<br /><br />Besides the flatness of characters, they also act unbelievably - a death knell for any scifi movie, no matter how big the sets.  Characters take off their helmets in what's clearly a f'd up looking spaceship where shit's gone wrong - 'cause that's safe.  When they discover what should be the biggest thing in history, they seem no more amazed then if they had just bought a Happy Meal and the toy was broken.  They then leave that discovery because it will be getting cold outside - not 150 degrees below zero cold mind you, just cold.  I guess the trillion dollar expedition forgot to bring matches for a fire.  Just totally unbelievable.<br /><br />No sense from the script (which is set so relatively near in the future) if there's even been any other alien life discovered before this trip or even when warp drive was discovered.  It doesn't seem like the adventure of a life time to these characters (which of course it should), but more like a pain in the ass trip to the corner store for diapers.  When they see the giant human head statue found on a deserted world in the middle of dead space, no one bats so much as an eyelash.  Absolutely the wrong tone.  Even the characters in the original ALIEN - who were nothing but glorified space truckers - took more glee in their potential discovery.<br /><br />Equally stupid are the character's actions - Somehow 2 characters get lost 50 feet from the front door of the alien ship.... then even more inexplicably are left behind there b/c no one knows they're missing.  One guy gets infected by what I guess is an alien, but says NOTHING (you know, even though they're on a trillion dollar scientific research spaceship).  Just dumb, both in believability and in tone.<br /><br />Just as wrong in tone is the music, which half the time is brilliant (when he channels Jerry Goldsmith) and the rest of the time is just awful.  For some unknown reason, Scott must have instructed composer Marc Streitenfeld to write \\"hero\\" music for the \\"Prometheus\\" alien, which any time it's played take one immediately out of any sort of suspense that might have built up to that point.  Absolutely stupid and again it makes one wonder just how Scott could have made such a plainly wrong decision - it is a horror movie after all, right?  At other times, when the shit hits the fan, the music is so loud and so wrong that it literally kills any danger that characters you barely care about might be in.<br /><br />And lastly, the continuity errors.  Just oodles of them when compared to the original, including two so huge they had to be on purpose... didn't they?<br /><br />In the end, you really have to ask yourself why this movie was made.  Whatever it does for the storyline could have been done in about a 1/4 of the screen time - and regardless of the storytelling (or lack thereof), it covers much of the same ground that ALIEN V PREDATOR did (without ever telling the audience whether or not we should consider that movie canon or not).  If I sound frustrated, that's because I am.  The ALIEN universe is a cool one, with more then enough story-lines to do something new.  The \\"revelations\\" this movie shows us are A) predictable and B) underwhelming, both in scope and execution.  At times, just when you think the movie might pull it's feet from the blah mire it's in and reach something special, it falls right back into the goop.<br /><br />Simply put, a movie set in that universe with a $150 plus million budget aught not be so average.  It feels like it should be a great film, or at least a very good film (mostly because of the amazing sets and CG work), but in the end it's terribly blah.  In the end, I'd have to say that AVP is actually a better movie, b/c while that film doesn't reach nearly so high, it does actually achieve what it sets out to do.<br /><br />Hate to say it, but after ROBIN HOOD and now this, it's clear that Ridley's lost it.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  3 I think Michael Fassbender looks like a young Peter O'Toole too! out of 5

B002IR9ZSG|4.0|This is not a presentation for the faint-hearted. Rather, it is a serious story about the early efforts to defeat slavery in the USA.  It should be viewed by all interested in the history of our country.
B009FZHYKU|1.0|Poor quality of streeming and the story content was also not up to expatations of first season . The second and third seasons were flop's and I will not order again. They needed to bring back Shane to spice up the show .It is a total FLOP,A complete waste of time...
B0076DCT2G|5.0|i am a cop show junkie... and a mystery/intrigue novel junkie. i have read everything written from ludlum( the real ludlum), follett, forsythe, cussler, baldacci, silva, connelly, grisham, clancy........ the list goes on, but you get the gist of my fiction preference. this book ranks right on top with the best. it hoolds your interest- is witty as well as exciting from start to finish! this dinosaur had enjoyed demille in the past, and has now rediscovered him.
B000FA5SMK|3.0|There is lots of excitement, which is what you expect from Mr. DeMille but all the sarcasm and smart remarks gets really &#34;tiring&#34;.  A return of the bumbling Colombo, from days gone.  The story is interesting but by the time it gets to the end it is getting really thin and you just wish he would get it done.  It was was a good read but certainly not his best work
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Advertised as a feel good movie, this film was much more than that. It made me feel good because it scratched the surface of human relationships. It combined character-based humor as people dealt with the dilapidation of an Indian hotel and their old age. As I am facing the latter, it probably meant more to me. The cast is a tour de force of British acting witgh a large measure of excellent Indian acting. It does everything I expect from a film. It takes you away from yourself in space and time, and brings you back home.
B007MDB71O|1.0|I have been a fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs since I was a boy and the Mars series was my favorite of his large body of work.  I always watch a movie made from a book that I like with some trepidation, but having recently watched the Hunger Games where the movie did an excellent job of portraying not only the story line of the book but also the motivation of the main characters, I was ready to see a movie from one of my old favorites.  Fortunately, I was able to watch it on a movie channel and did not waste the money on the DVD. I agree with one reviewer that the special effects people must have read the book, because the Tharks and white apes and other animals were very credibly made. Unfortunately, the writers of the story line mostly just cribbed a few names out of the book and abandoned the plot of the book entirely.  Instead of John Carter, gallant southern gentleman, with a mysterious past and fine sword fighting skills, we have a confused and selfish man totally focused on his gold mine and indifferent to the people around him.  Instead of the lovely and gracious Dejah Thoris, who volunteers to marry a man she despises to save her people from destruction, we have a woman running away from this and covered with silly tattoos as well, somehow pretending to be a scientist.  Her grandfather, Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium, on the other hand is anxious that she make this marriage, while in the book, he and the rest of the population of Helium would have died rather than force such a union. There was no mention of the atmosphere plant and John Carter's ultimate sacrifice to save all of Mars, losing his own happiness while doing so. And how did the Therns get into this story.  They don't show up until Carter returns to Mars, and they are a sneaky, cowardly bunch who sit at the mouth of the river Iss waiting to eat the other Martians as they complete their final pilgrimage to what the Therns have taught them is Heaven.<br /><br />To sum up:  If you have not read the book, expect a movie with a confused and tedious plot, unlikable characters, and mediocre acting.  If you have read and loved Mr. Burroughs story, forget buying the DVD and buy some Powerball tickets instead.  You will have a far greater chance of winning the big prize than finding anything to like in this movie.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Started out well but seemed to use &#34;plot trickery&#34; to carry it through.  First time I've been really disappointed with Grisham's work.
B00A5052YE|5.0|2012 is a strong year for R&B, and Alicia Keys' latest album \\"Girl On Fire\\" is another strong R&B album.<br /><br />\\"Girl On Fire\\" has an impressive list of producers and writers - Babyface, Saleem Remi, Bruno Mars, Jamie xx, Gary Clark Jr., Emeli Sande, Darkchild, Jeff Bhasker, Frank Ocean, Dr. Dre, among others.  And when you combine their talents with Alicia's talent as a singer and piano player, you're sure to come up with excellent results.<br /><br />This album never becomes monotonous - every song has a different formula. Like all of her other albums, Keys combines retro R&B with modern R&B.  The first two singles, \\"New Day\\" and the title track (ft. Nicki Minaj), combine hip-hop flare with piano soul. All of Emeli Sande's contributions (\\"Brand New Me\\", \\"Not Even The King\\", \\"101\\") are stripped down and features just Alicia and her piano.  \\"Tears Always Win\\" is Bruno Mars' contribution. It's an upbeat throwback to 50s pop-soul, not unlike some of Bruno's own songs.  \\"That's When I Knew\\" is a Babyface-produced tune similar to the acoustic R&B he produced in the 90s. \\"When It's All Over\\" is produced by Jamie xx and combines The xx-like indie-synth flourishes with Alicia's soulfulness.  \\"Listen To Your Heart\\" also combine Alicia's typical sound with synth flourishes.  \\"One Thing\\" is Ocean's contribution. It's not as strong as some of Ocean's other work, but still good.<br /><br />There are negative comments that the album's lyrics are trite and clich&eacute;. I have to somewhat agree with that - the songwriting is nothing special.  However, Alicia's performance and the excellent production make up for that.<br /><br />The strongest songs, in my opinion, are \\"When It's All Over, \\"Listen To Your Heart\\", \\"Girl On Fire\\", \\"Tears Always Win\\", and \\"101\\". (4.25 out of 5 stars)<br /><br />--Isa R Bufano, 12/05/2012
B003O86FMW|5.0|Could not put the book down.  Such vivid detail....I can picture the arena.  Starting the next book now, can't wait to see what happens.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|One of the best performance CPU for around $100. Did a new built and love it. Most cores for you money!
B009329ZF2|4.0|Watched so hubby could have a &#34;guy&#34; movie.  I think I almost liked it better than him!  He liked it too, but I was surprised at how much I did!
B003TOMAPC|2.0|to mature for kids and to boring for adults.. tons of mayhem but Nicolas Cage does his normal &#34;phone in performance&#34; I wouldn't watch it again.
075669812X|5.0|Very happy with the product I purchased...i received my purchase within a few days. Great customer service!!! I highly recommend.
B0083GPDBO|1.0|one of the worse movies I have ever seen. Bad acting and oh my gosh bad special effects. If you have nothing else to watch your better off watching a rerun of SpongeBob Square Pants.
B009DP9D6A|5.0|A bit different than what Deadmau5 fans have heard before, but nonetheless its an awesome album! Professional Griefers is sick!
B009RI4FRU|4.0|I really thought it would come off as a joke, the kids silly. Really it was well acted and sincere. I liked the movie, a lot of sad life lessons but told in a understated way.
B0087HT36U|3.0|Good game to waste time but not addicting to me.  You flick your finger forward and it sends out a cannonball in the direction of the enemy's structure.  Hit it in the right spot and the structure comes a tumbling down.
B007HJ91HU|3.0|Color me shocked but I actually liked the movie and I didn't want to.. being all loyal to Kevin Bacon and such. Julianne Hough was really good and I'm surprised because I thought she was terrible in Rock Of Ages. Pretty much a redo of the origional but still worth your time.
B002RI9YCI|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it kept my interest right to the end.It was written with such quirky humour.
B0081L37Z0|4.0|Best Channing Tatum movie so far. I was never a fan of the series so I didn't really know what to expect but it was well acted and I enjoyed it. I'd watch it again.
1451696191|5.0|The book was thrilling and yet not once overwhelming! At times you hardly could make yourself put down the book to take a mental break!
B009VB97EY|2.0|I didn't get all the big build up. I get it was Channing Tatums life and all that but I don't think I'd share if it was the way I started my movie career. It's OK for a night with the chicks but to sit by yourself and wishing for something more than eye candy it was lacking.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I chose this rating because I just could not put this book down!!! It was amazing. I will definitely read the trilogy again!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I love this movie but then again I'm a huge fan of Maggie Smith and Judi Dench. It was a lot of fun and I will watch it again

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Better than the first book (didn't think that was possible). Lets you enjoy an erotic lifestyle without even leaving the house!!

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love love love this series. An erotic novel with a beautiful love story to boot. We need more of these books!!!
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|If you don't like the various &quot;stories&quot; then you might not like it. For some reason,I like this better than the stories.<br />P.S How do you race dragons?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is amazing. It is more than just kinky sex and erotic lifestyles. You really learn to love the characters and wish for a Christian Grey of your own.
B008HJGPVO|1.0|First and this has nothing to do with the product but I got worried when I couldnt track the shipmment. It appears that amazon said it shipped while it did not. As a prime member I get free two day shipping, realizing this they shipped overnight according to the label. Anyway the package arrived a day late from the original delivery date.<br /><br />It came in the frustration free packaging so it was easy to open. When I got it open the first thing I did was take the \\"cap\\" off and look at the tips. It looked ok but then I attempted to put the cap back on one side and it fell off. I put it on the other side and it is just barely tight enuogh to not fall off when turning upside down. Basically this renders the little clip on the pen completely useless and now I am worried about losing that piece. So then I open up my little drawing program that I got this for on my tablet and attempt to write. I say attempt because it was very jumpy missing parts of a line. I thought ok my screen is dirty so I cleaned the screen. Still no consistant line. So I think what if I take off the screen protector (even though my finger works fine through it), nope still works like crap. So I clean the screen again, spotty line. I tried to use each one of the tips in this fashion. Just to see if it is my tablet I go ahead and download my drawing app onto my phone, test with my finger, works great, test with the pen it sucks is spotty and cant complete a line.<br /><br />To sum it up the cap should fit on either end and not fall off. If needed put threads in the cap and on the pen so that you can screw it on or maybe a rubber grommet to hold it on. The pen just doesnt work with any consistancy and this will be the first item that I ask for a refund on that I have ever purchased from amazon in the 7+ years that I have been buying here.<br />Maybe I got a defective pen but its too late I dont trust it and dont want another one.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love playing this game on my phone or tablet. It keeps me entertained for a while. And it is nice that this is the ad-free app so it makes playing go very smoothly.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I purchased this when I was trying to see what the fascination was with Zombie movies. After watching the first season I was so glad that I did. So very fun to watch and Im on the edge of my seat.
0843133333|5.0|Great books! Love the lessons taught! My son struggled with reading at first and after I started purchasing these books, he started to LOVE reading!!  We have several. The shipment was timely and we're delighted!
B008WCP2KG|5.0|I had seen previews but still wasnt sure what I expected to see. I was happy that the storyline was played out and the acting was very good. I purchased this as a gift but decided to watch it and keep it. I was not familiar with Channing Tatum but after this movie I believe I will get more familiar with his films.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The trilogy was absolutely great. It is definitely a must read. I guarantee that once you read book one, you will have to read book two, and of course you must finish with book three. Wish there was a four and five.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I purchased this to see what the fascination was with Zombies, Oh my goodness its got great writing and direction. I quickly purchased the other seasons as well. I love this series!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could not put this book down. Definitely, occupied by time during the holiday break. After reading book one I had to quickly order book two.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|It would be good to have different types of Views to see a folder content and perform different kind of sorting( by name, by size, by creation date, etc).
B00009V7PJ|5.0|This concert is full of excellent music, colorful costumes, and outstanding dancing.  If you want to be entertained, this is the DVD to watch.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|As a Twitter lover, I loved this app. So easy to get on my Twitter when I am in a rush and want to check my news feed quick.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is by far the best adventure game!  It challenges you in every screen making you think about your next move in a fun adventure.  The puzzles are clever with just the right amount of hidden object screens not to mention exquisite graphics.  I have played most of the games availabe at Amazon and this one is by far the best, so good that I will play it again.  Alawar please continue to make such sophisticated, smart, beautiful and fun games.<br /><br />LizzieZ
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|I like the majority of this album songs such as Figure 8 and Only you sound distinct from everything else in music.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Lets you know when wifi is available and lets you know how steady your signal is.  Great for diagnosing connection problems.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|What a book..what a writer!  Not particular fond of &#34;flash backs&#34; but this story was weaved together so well you hardly notice.  Such a great story.  Would love to see if she does a sequel to find out what happens to Cassandra and her &#34;friend&#34; she met at the cottage.  Just about the time you think you have it all figured out you come to realize you didn't.  The writer includes the fairy tales which take you back in time to when you were a kid and for a time you are Eliza.  I couldn't stop reading it and didn't want it to end...by all means, read it!!
B000AMJC2K|3.0|It's well made, but the height adjustment is a little stiff to operate.  It does not allow the monitor to go below the level of the top of the stem on the clamp.  From the photos, I thought it might.  It is, however, sturdy and reasonably easy to assemble.  I had no issues with the tilt or swivel adjustments for the monitor itself and found it easy to get the monitor &#34;square&#34; after I moved it in or out from my desk.  I ended up getting the LX version from the same company for my purposes, but kept this one in order to mount a second monitor.  For the price, it is okay.
B009IA3O2O|5.0|Kamelot's an awesome band. Roy Khan quit after Poetry for the Poisoned, but they got a new singer and he kinda sounds like Roy a little, but not as opera-esque.  Kamelot is still Kamelot though, and awesome is still awesome.
1849904251|5.0|Brilliant book.<br /><br />There's so much to look at through the many cases that John and Sherlock have worked on. It's simply not a one-page explanation, either; each case spans several pages with many post-it note additions from Sherlock. Their bantering via the post-it notes is simply hilarious and completely in character.<br /><br />As well as case notes, there is several pages dedicated to the real life of Sherlock Holmes- Jeremy Brett, Basil Rathbone, even Hugh Laurie as House- 'interviews' with the cast, information on ACD, etc. Especially interesting to learn all of the little references that Moffat and Gatiss used to bring the original canon into the series.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for any Sherlocked fan. The final entry from John brings back all the feels that Reichenbach gave to us to begin with, and a final post-it note from Sherlock is nearly nostalgic. Overall, a wonderful Sherlockian find.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I originally signed up for Pinterest because my wife wanted to find creative recipes.  Since then I have discovered that there is a wide range of explorations to suit my interests also.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love the Star Wars take on a great game! Some levels are harder than others but all in all a good app.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Freaking Amazing! Best Batman! Christian Bale has delivered some amazing performances as Batman, but this is the best there is.
B008HT4FUW|1.0|Gay relationship shown.  I thought it would be like a Jane Austen novel, but NO!  It was interesting up to the gay part, but I don't want to see two men kiss each other on any movie anywhere.  I give this warning so others don't waste their time or money on what APPEARS to be a family-oriented movie, but in actuality is totally inappropriate for anyone to watch, in my opinion.
0071373586|5.0|I thought this book was pretty interesting and engaging. Gave me an overview of marketing and how to position products. I don't think I learned much from reading the book, but more so this book gave me a base
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Get Part I and Part II together. It makes a lot more sense if you watch them one after the other. Together they are the best Harry Potter movie yet!
B008JJM88Q|1.0|I bought this game because I used a friends on ipad and it was GREAT..bought for my kindle and it will not work.  E-mailed for help and that did not help.  Very disappointed
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Get Part I and Part II together. It makes a lot more sense if you watch them one after the other. Together they are the best Harry Potter movie yet!
B004EKCNMA|4.0|I thought this animated film was really quite remarkable, Carey was a lot more restrained than I thought he would be, he was very good. Many people have said it is too dark for children, I agree, even my teenager looked at me at one point, and said &#34;This is wacked, can I go?&#34; It just wasn't Muppets Christmas Carol - our forever Christmas Eve family tradition. She was disturbed. It was startling, actually, how gruesome it got. Spoiler alert - Ghost of Christmas present dies of what appears to be a massive heart attack, and then devolves into a skeleton that blows away like ash. The children in the folds of his coat reminded me of the apocalyptic stragglers from the Will Smith film, I Am Legend. It was in deed, really wacked. There is a carriage chase a little reminiscent of the Ghost of Sleepy Hollow, something not in the book, I think, and the end of that scene was very frightening. It really was too bad, would that the director has been as restrained as Carey - sometimes enough is just perfect. In spite of those things, or aside of them I suppose - I thought it was quite an accomplishment. The lovely bits were sublime.
B000002MX7|5.0|She is a true winner and a hit single &#34;I feel for You&#34; that is Solid Gold but, I'm a fan and I would recommend this to all ages especially everyone who missed it when it first came out in 1980's.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have never been so engrossed in a book ever!  A must read, I promise, you will be sucked in!

B007RUAS3K|5.0|I own the CD version in addition to the vinyl copy as its that good a album.<br /><br />Just Buy It.
B009Z8HCR2|5.0|I have been a fan of Deftones since I first heard Around the Fur. To date this seems to be the most easily digestible Deftones album. It was very well written and at times not sounding like Deftones at all, Chino's lyrics, and Abe's drums are always my favorite's. This has been my favorite album so far. I fully recommend it to anyone who is a Deftones fan, or just a music lover.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I look forward to each episode so much so I purchased some of the episodes - something I would not ordinarily do.
B001HZK8FY|5.0|this is my girlfriends favorit movie so whe i gave it to her she was in love with it and everything in it :)
B009K45Y62|5.0|[...] it's pretty good if you are a hard core collector but as a regular fan, not that great. The cowl is not made of great material and doesn't look as cool as the pic shows
B0049J3QF4|5.0|My son's hands down favorite movie. We could watch this movie one million times and still very much enjoy it.
B004P52NP6|4.0|This thing isn't their eponymous album that spawned all of those hits in the late 80s, and turned Tawny into everyone's favorite rock and roll sex kitten.  But it does have some nods back to those days with the huge guitar based rock...Love Will Set You Free is my personal favorite.  This is probably a good buy for anyone who's been a WS fan.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Very cute movie. I actually enjoyed the movie...and so did the kids...lol. Sidebar although tinkerbell and periwinkle were twins...I just couldn't see it.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|Really good upbeat CD. The first three songs are THE BEST and then it kinda goes down from there. I
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|Actually Surprised me ..how they all can still rock after so many years...loved the updated version of the songs...esp Dased and confused..very tunes at a very good price..
B0083SBMBM|4.0|cool movie it was good to see HULK + THOR + CAPTIAN AMERICA + IRONMAN + NICK FURRY + BLACK WIDOW team up

B0070Y46UY|4.0|I tried to read Life of Pi when it was an Oprah Book Club selection, but for whatever reason I just couldn't get into it.  I'd make it 10-15 pages in and just get bored.  I was also perhaps less open to the materials very obvious religious mise en scène.  I was maybe a little too sensitive to being preached to at the time.<br /><br />I re-approached the book in advance of the film version debut, and I was determined to make it through.  And it was EASY as soon as the action moved to the ocean.  I think I was also a little less judgmental about the religious aspects (mellowing?) and took a &#34;to each their own&#34; mentality about it.  I think I finally understood that it wasn't about A religious philosophy, but rather about ALL spirituality.  I immediately connected to the concept of nature as &#34;god&#34;.  I tend to focus my faith on the mysteries of the observable; that's where I feel my quest for understanding is enjoined.<br /><br />As fantastical as the plot may be, the writing is fluid (pun intended?  I mean, he IS stuck in a boat on the ocean.), highly visual, and accessible.  There was a specific sense of identity and empathy for what Pi experiences on his harrowing journey.  I found myself thinking of whether I could survive his path, and truly wondering if I would have the strength.<br /><br />There was a particularly jarring section in the book's third act which upended my sense of equanimity.  But it was worth it and it cast a new, powerful light on the subject matter.  I left the book feeling broader than I had before, and that's one of the most positive things I could say about anything.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I got this for $30 and I am extremely happy with my purchase. The case is high quality and the movies look great. I have had zero issues so far.
B003L77G10|4.0|Was better than the first season, can't wait to see the third now...I'll definitely recommend it. It's better to see on DVD than tv...no interruptions!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is a great story.  If you like suspense and thrillers you'll love this book.  Finished it in one day.
B000002KNI|5.0|the best of these guys, takes me back to my teenage years and know the words to all the songs.
B000002A46|5.0|I bought this for my mom. She absolutely loves it. Mariah Carey is so talented and sings these Christmas carols with such grace and beauty.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I know this will be excellent, have it ordered, now waiting on season 3 to start next year. great series
B0042AEOG0|5.0|Bought this for my mom who is a Mariah fan. Had it directly shipped to mom's house. I was scared not knowing the condition the cd would be in. My mom called me and said the cd was practically brand new! She absolutely loves it!
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|very good, glad I got mine a while back. LOVE this series and will have all of them once they are released.
B008XBHIEY|5.0|I was impressed by the picture quality.  Considering when this was filmed, the images were great.  You can't beat the classics!
B008S4FZHI|5.0|As an avid fan of Patricia Cornwell, I wait with eager anticipation for the release of another new book and with this book, I was not disappointed. The disappointment came when the book was finished. Once again, this story centred on the main characters of her Scarpetta novels: Kay Scarpetta, the chief medical examiner; Benton Wesley, psychologist/FBI profiler and who happens to be Kay's husband; Pete Marino, an ex policeman and now private investigator with an unsavoury past and Kay's lesbian niece, Lucy. This book can be read without having to read previous novels however if you have read the other Scarpetta novels you will feel at home with these characters. I feel that I know them all well. The author often refers to past  incidents experienced by these characters without being repetitious, but providing just enough information to make the story flow. There were unexpected twists along the way. To describe the storyline would be to spoil the reader's journey. Nothing more can be said except this is another ripper.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Awesome for indoor and provide bounce capability that is lacking from the built in Nikon camera. Perfect for beginner DSLR
B000H2R71G|5.0|I have loved Mad Max since the 80's. Is the acting good? No. Is the story at all believable? No but, hell no. But, its a movie I enjoy watching several times a year and never get bored watching it.
1469984202|1.0|I too read the reviews, downloaded the book, and looked forward to a great read.  The characters are flat, and the concepts are elementary. The plot moves slowly with very few interesting descriptions in between events. At the halfway point, I could sum it up in several sentences and found it difficult to finish.  The writing style is okay; nothing is annoying in regard to style.  However, the book is missing information that if this was a real situation that I would want to know.  I felt like I was reading a book and not entering an unknown world, and this is most likely due to the lack of sensory details.  Neither the primary idea of living in a silo nor the human reaction to doing so is unusual. I wanted to be forced to think about something that my own mind wouldn't think of, but that didn't happen.
1449410243|5.0|I just got this as a little funny for hubby's stocking...omg it is so funny! We have 2 cats that are crazy, and this book is full of funny jokes and comic strips about cats. Every page made me laugh. I hated to wrap it up as I wanted to keep it for a giggle after a long day at work! Definitely get it for anyone with a cat and a silly sense of humor ;P
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|works as promised. they're making me write 17 more words, but seriously, there's only one thing to say for a product like this. it works, or it doesn't. This one works just fine.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Read cover to cover and it was intense.  I am already downloading the 2nd book to continue!
B000FA5TTW|4.0|Despite the nasty crime of rape and murder, the story tends to be upbeat. The girls in heaven are charmingly juxtaposed against the people left on earth to deal with the aftershocks.<br />The characters are well delineated. Enough tension is created by the opportunity for the rapist to strike again in the same family. The father's instincts are good and believable.<br />Her final earthly appearance at his hospital bedside was touching.
B003XWFLTM|5.0|I didn't need additional recordings of these pieces but I'm glad I bought this set.  The performances have an elegance somewhat lacking in some of my other versions. The recording quality is very good; atmospheric, transparent and very dynamic. I'm glad they included the less familiar pieces.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|As the author of [[ASIN:B009PNL9FI Internet Marketing For Beginners:How To Start or Jumpstart Your Business Using Free Online Marketing Techniques]], I know a little about marketing books on Amazon. John Locke goes into detail about what not to do and how to prevent spending unnecessary funds while trying to market your book. The advice that he gives is great. He stresses the importance of having a marketing plan which I believe is key; and he further outlines the necessary tools that are required to market your book online. John is an author who has sold over 1 million e-books so I would say to follow the wisdom he imparts. There are a lot of good ideas here that any self-published author will find helpful.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This is the best photo app out there!  There are a ton of options and the quality of the end result is top notch!
B002ZG97EC|4.0|I ordered a copy on Cyber Monday. When my copy arrived there was no redeem code for the digital copy. I sent it back. I got a replacement that arrived with a redeem code but with the case broken in several spots. I may send this one back but I'm not sure i wanna find out what I'll get next time.
1451629192|5.0|The beginning of the book was a little hard to get through but I am glad I kept reading. I am pleased with the outcome of the book.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|At least on other digital copies they give you a choice between iTunes or Windows! why would I want to conjest my digital device with another app when all my digital movies are on iTunes???? I tried looking for a blu ray + digital copy, but it doesn't exist yet, or i can download it for $ from itunes....
B005K0HDGE|5.0|We chose this for our book club and I am very much looking forward to the discussion! I think that Stephen King has brought an important historical event and shown how it's impact could have changed the world. It was hard to really sink my teeth into at first but once I got started I found it hard to put down.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Fabulous Book, She is a excellent author it keeps you not wanting to put it down I am looking forward to all her other books.

B0053O89WY|4.0|Love every season and this is one of the best...... I can not get enough and can't wait to add season six.
B000JIHP88|4.0|Got this as a Gift for my 1st baby, and now my 2nd baby having it @ his crib (we have this almost 2 years and still in good condition).  Good quality from Fisher-Price, beautiful melodies that enchants my LO to sleep.  Remote isn't working well sometimes, but no big deal about it. Definitely a GREAT GIFT for any Newborns!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|We were tired of trying to find the movies to rent in order...wonderful having them all together!! Now we can watch whenever we are all together, and very affordable too!
0143119680|5.0|If you love books about witches and vampires you will adore this book--a paranormal romance that I could not put down. Just purchased book 2 which starts at the end of this one--have not read it yet, but am looking forward to it. If you are not into series--this novel also stands alone very nicely,but I guarantee you will find yourself buying number 2.
B005J29HD0|5.0|First, let me say that I am not a diehard Beach Boys fan, but rather, a big fan of 60s pop music in general.  For most of my life, I have considered the Beach Boys' classic songs a bit corny and \\"square\\" when compared to, say, the Brian Jones-era Stones.  That said, I appreciate the artistic merits of early songs like \\"In My Room,\\" and have always been curious about the aura of secrecy surrounding \\"Smile,\\" in much the same way that I have always appreciated Syd Barrett's work with the early Pink Floyd.  A friend forced me to see Brian Wilson and his band play back when the 2004 version of \\"Smile\\" was released; and while I was not completely won over by the contemporary-style presentation on stage, I did appreciate the music itself enough to pick up a hefty \\"Smile\\" bootleg shortly thereafter.  So there is really nothing new in the present vinyl version that I haven't already heard, apart from the important fact that the original recordings for the \\"Smile\\" LP, originally intended for release in late 1966-early 1967, have now finally been officially released.  Yet it is clear from both the official title, \\"The Smile Sessions,\\" and from the vinyl tracks as selected, that the album as it might have been originally released must always remain unfinished. \\"Smile\\" thus remains a conceptual piece, either to be completed in the devoted listener's imagination, or left in fragments as rendered here, or perhaps better still, as contained in the fuller box-set (I bought the LP version since I am not a diehard fan and wanted something closer in physical substance to what it would have been, if originally released).<br /><br />As for the music itself, it is of course wonderful, as others have already mentioned, consisting of many potential classics that sadly, never saw the light of day in their time.  And if we can place its intended release chronologically between the Beatles' \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" LPs, it certainly would have pointed to another kind of psychedelic-inspired pop music, rounding this out somewhat--although I do feel that \\"Smile\\" probably would have sunk like a stone in the American market upon release, faring worse than \\"Pet Sounds\\" in this regard.  That is not to say that the music itself was bad for its time, just that the general or \\"square\\" Beach Boys record-buying public would probably not have been ready for such an album then.  As a case in point, look at how the \\"Heroes and Villains\\" single stalled on the charts back in the day.  Now listening to it more than forty years later, what strikes me is how distinctly American it sounds.  For all the talk of Brian Wilson trying to out-do the Beatles' \\"Rubber Soul\\" with \\"Pet Sounds,\\" and \\"Revolver\\" with \\"Smile,\\" I hear little or no influence of the British Invasion on the \\"Smile\\" tracks, and from this, \\"Smile\\" suggests the possibility of a 1960s American pop music scene without the Beatles' influence.  From this, I am led to surmise that Brian Wilson was not just taking on the Beatles at the time, but the entire appropriation of American music by the British Invasion! That in itself, apart from all the other pressures that he must have been facing at the time, would have been enough to trigger an artistic meltdown.  And if so, the suits at Capitol (home to the Beatles at the time, as well as the Beach Boys) would not have been pleased in the least either.<br /><br />But just as a 1960s without the Beatles was not to be, a 1960s with \\"Smile\\" (as it was intended) was also not to be--the latter perhaps remaining the obverse side of the coin as considered here.  I am glad to have this official copy of \\"Smile\\" at long last though, since it provides a more concrete suggestion of these two historical non-occurrences as possibilities.  The vinyl I have received is fine by my standards, the records themselves having been shipped in separate sleeves, in addition to the ones with Brian Wilson's text and the lyrics that others have found fit too tightly.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love the Piano Guys! I first found them on YouTube & became a fan then! I was very excited when they released a CD, and it does not disappoint!!<br /><br />I loved this album! Each & every song!!
1934030554|5.0|It was beyond I was wondering! Nice to read, very detailed about products... I am still reading, but I think that I'll be better im my trainings after that.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I read Fifty Shades of Grey before the Crossfire series... The books have many similarities... Too many for my taste... This book is good, but I couldn't get over how it seemed to be a rip-off of Fifty Shades. I mean, come on! Main female leads; Ana & Eva... Male leads have the same initials, just switched around!<br /><br />Its a good book, and I will read the next when it comes out, but I was a little disappointed...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Addicted to this show!!  It just keeps getting better and better! Unpredictable, Exciting, THRILLING!  Don't get AMC anymore on TV so this is how I keep up.
1476712042|5.0|This was my first book by Jamie McGuire, I had bought it a few months ago and didn't read until months later only because I had others I thought were better. I figured since it was college students it was going to have to much drama, but boy did it disappoint, it was excellent.  True love story of a bad boy Travis Maddog Maddox meets a good girl Pigeon is what Travis nicknames her.  I couldn't put it down, read it in less than 2 days.  Now I haven't been able to find another like it.
1449415881|5.0|For Pete's sake...it's Dilbert.  I read him in the paper every day and then buy the calendar so I can enjoy him again.  Plus, I save the calendar pages that are my favs so I can look at them over and over.  I even laminate the very best ones. The Dilbert desk calendar is a great way to start the day with a laugh.
0425263916|5.0|I read Bared to You, so of course I had to read the 2nd novel to see what happens.  This one is much better than the 1st book.  Gideon and Eva are such a match, scared of committing but love each other so much they can't live without eachother.  I have read it 2x and loved it both times.
0316227706|3.0|I went through the book in about 30 minutes and enjoyed it and will probably look at again before loaning it out to the other dog lovers I know who will appreciate it also.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I was a fan of the others and wanted to see how the trilogy ended. Christopher Nolan showed why he's one of the best. The video was clear and I watched it on my Kindle Fire. A very long movie, but I was glued to the screen the entire time.
034580404X|4.0|It was a good option, although the paper material was not the best, same as the cover of the books.
B001JI72AI|5.0|Good movie.  Kids liked it too.  Everyone enjoyed it and it led to lots of discussion with the kids about the NASA space program.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My Grandkids love this game on my Kindle Fire.  It has lots of new tricks and the birds are winning!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you like human drama mixed with a little zombie killing, then you will love the Walking Dead.  The real threat are the humans and the zombies are just the obstacles.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|Purchased as part of Black Friday sale at a very good price.  The digital content code in the disc expired 9/30/12.  It doesn't make the movie bad, but it does impact the product such that it is not what is described.
B00637HXNG|1.0|I am a HUGE Scorpions fan, but the quality of this Blu-Ray Disc is horrible. I have a 55\\" Samsung LED 3D TV 8000 Series with a Samsung BD-C6900 3D Blu-Ray Player if that helps. The picture freezes a lot and for some reason only what is in the foreground of the picture seems to stay focused. Everything in the background shakes from side to side during the entire concert. Imagine watching an entire movie oscillating your head side to side really quickly. Its annoying and nauseating. I don't know if it is only my copy that does that? All my other 3D movies play without any problems. The silver lining is that I was able to see this concert live, so I am not left wondering how cool it must have been to be there. Bottom line: quality is inconsistent, sometimes it is incredible other times it seems it was recorded with a Hi-8 handheld recorder so I'd avoid buying this blu-ray at all costs.
B009X01C64|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3K2F1EGFA0ZBS]]The Marware Revolve is a very nice case, even without the graceful spinning.  The material is high quality, not too bulky, and it doesn't block important ports (if it does, you put it on backwards).  The Kindle is easy to install or remove.<br /><br />The ability to spin the case, allowing the Kindle to sit at different angles, is hard to explain, so I made a short video.  It is my first and I apologize if it is on the amateur side.  What I am trying to show is that it is easy to change the angle and orientation.  Once set, it is very sturdy, so swiping or typing does not make it wobble.<br /><br />Music courtesy of Army Navy.  Hands courtesy of me.
B000084T18|5.0|I reccomend this product. Great Cd, love the song 21 questions. Its a must have for any women who has a man in prision =)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If your looking for an exciting easy read, this is the book you have to read! I definitely recommend it!
111846446X|5.0|Arived on time and was just enough to get started on the raspberry pi. It was well worth the price.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Tim has saved his best for last. I'm a fan of his previous books but this epic encyclopedia of how to master anything is far and away the best of the bunch. Many many many useful lessons on how to master any skill with simple and effective steps anyone can follow. You're doing yourself a disservice if you don't buy this book!
B003B02PF4|3.0|I liked this book, but didn't love this book.  It didn't hold me.  I didn't feel the need to keep going back for more, and it seemed predictable.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Throughly enjoyable trash! It was great reading during the Sandy Storm when I did not have power and spent more time in bed to keep warm. Aside from the lacivious nature of the material, I enjoyed the witty emails between Mr. Grey and his love interest. I htink that is where the better writing occurred.
B00A6PD8RQ|1.0|When it comes to animated movies, I prefer those that connect with audiences at multiple levels.  There should be the normal, predictable humor targeted to children.  But since my kids have grown, my wife and I prefer animated movies that also contains some cultural references targeted to adults as well.  This is best exemplified in the Shrek movies.<br /><br />This particular movie had nothing for adults.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Great graphics and a fun game of logic.  My kids enjoy it making it hard to get my kindle back.
B009CPE424|4.0|I watched this with my dog.  He loved it too.<br /><br />I'm not much for Children's movies, but I like dogs and so took a chance.  If you want something light and fun, this is the ticket.
B00138GZAC|5.0|What a wonderful voice.  I cannot get enough of her music.  It is so soothing, peaceful, and gentle in the wonderful melodys she sings
B008MG1E4A|2.0|I gave up. Just one battle scene after another. Half way through i felt that I had learned all I wanted to know about the Navy Seals and their elite teams. Well written but repetitive.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I just watched Season 1 over the last three days, and now I understand all the interest in it.  The acting is really good, the characters are good, and the twists and turns in each show make you want to know what is going on, it keeps you interested.  There are parts that, to me, are a little hokey, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
B007HGPBRC|3.0|I was hoping for more insight on Hitchens' contemplation of his own mortality. He is, of course, a brilliant and compelling writer and I was hard pressed to stop reading his raw and stunning depiction of his unfolding death. I now know a lot more about what it is like to die; not so much about facing Mortality.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Words meanings, everything. Just like the real book. It gets really good in the middle. The ending will surprise you
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Both my son &amp; i have this app installed on kindle fire &amp; kindle fire hd. Great thought provoking game as the obvious path is not always correct. Nice game.  No problems.

B004KBSQBA|5.0|I chose this rating because I really love the music. I play it in my car and every time I go to town I'm singing, Graceland, Graceland, I'm going to Graceland, Memphis,Tennessee, I'm going to Graceland.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I picked this up a while back when it was featured on the appstore, played around with a bit and more or less forgot about it...until yesterday. My husband was on some prescription pain meds that were causing his mind to race and keeping him from falling asleep.  After one bad night for both of us, I remembered the app. He mixed his sounds, and in 30 minutes we both were out! Not a daily-use app for me, but a real lifesaver at times.
B004TPJMLA|4.0|I like Paul Simon and I wanted this CD. It isn't as good as Graceland, but it is still Paul Simon. I like the rhythms and the beat of the music.
