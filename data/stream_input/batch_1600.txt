B001EBV0NU|5.0|We love this movie and watch it whenever we need a good laugh.  Fun to see so many serious actors in comical roles.  The premise the story is a hoot.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|excellent ! excellent ! excellent !  Winderful adventure and an excelent journey into the 1920. My Grandfather was in the first world war.  Interesing to see what times wherre like in those days .
B004PGNB1K|4.0|I liked the second day of the chronicles even better than the first. Kvothe is growing, and the isues are touching the basic values . It is hard to believe he is only 17 years old!<br /><br />The language stays poetic, but poetry does not interfere with suspense.<br /><br />Why oh why is the 3rd day not for kindle?
B0086DBE62|4.0|It was not a complete waste of time.  Very funny in spots and the 7 Dwarfs were great.  Julia Roberts is always good.  Lily Collins could use some acting lessons though.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I did not like the ending of this book.  Although I admit that Flynn's writing kept me highly engaged in the story and the characters, I felt cheated out of a satisfying resolution.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book was great! I only give it four stars because I felt like the end was to rushed and short. But overall it was a great book!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These books were fantastic.  The subject matter is not for everyone, but inbetween the sex scenes is a good story that unfolds across 3 books and all in a matter of months.  It's a day-to-day experience on each page.<br /><br />I am actually rereading these books now, skipping through a lot of the sex stuff so that I can focus on the underlying story of how each character morphs into their genuine selves at the end of the book.<br /><br />I especially loved the epilogue in book 3 where they describe Ana and Christian's first meeting as seen through Christian's eyes.  I'd love to read all 3 books from his perspective. . . maybe???
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book! Its hard for me to get into a book and this wasn't hard at all! I love how the author makes you feel part of their relationship because it causes you not to stop reading. You are constantly thinking what's going to happen next! That's what every book should be like.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Fun read while poolside or at the beach.  Hard to put the book down.  Not as trashy as I originally thought it would be.  Interesting plot line with dynamic characters.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second book was great because the author flowed the two books together so well and it made the readers want more after every page
B008602KQI|4.0|Very good job especially keeping it with a PG-13 rating. Good job following story line and great special effects.[[ASIN:B0084IG7KC The Hunger Games [2-Disc Blu-ray + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]]]
B00122LXTM|5.0|This package from the Doobie brothers contains both the original Tom Johnston days with gems like \\"China Grove\\" as well as the later years with Michael McDonald,whose experience with Steely Dan gave them a classic keyboard sound.Remember\\"Minute by Minute\\" was the best seller of 1979.It even has the reunion song \\"The Doctor\\".One great total package.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|Loved the book. The movie was ok. Wish there was more detail. I think if I hadn't read the book I would have been very confused by the movie.
B00846REIS|2.0|This novel kept my attention but was too much like a carbon copy of 50 Shades of Grey. There were also some parts that made little to no sense. For example (SPOILER ALERT) there is a part where Gideon says \\"I want you to be my submissive\\" yet nothing ever comes of it. I am utterly confused as to where that part in the book came from and what it's purpose was. I will not be reading the second. Shame on you, Sylvia Day, for the shameless plagiarism.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|im glad i finished the book,now i can get down to some serious material. i can't see myself putting anything to practice.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I like the selection of sounds that can be mixed together.  My only issue is that using the timer with the box checked to close the app when the time runs out doesn't work.
B00004ZELJ|5.0|This product was well worth the money I spent.  I had the VCR but unfortunately, it was damaged in the flood.  Have been wanting to replace it for some time.
B008602KQI|5.0|I really enjoyed this film adaptation of the book.  The action was good, and all the right parts of the book were represented.  I can't wait for the next one to come out.
B006LSZECO|3.0|My wife saw the book reviewed on TV so asked me to download from Amazon. Interesting story telling approach. Worth reading. Little long and wordy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is completely aweseome and way easier than trying to navigate the actual  pinterest.com website on any of my android devices. Highly recommend for anyone  who uses Pinterest.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|This was a good movie but a bit too violent for my liking. I did like the ultimate meaning though. The Good over Evil prevails sort of story. I appreciated that someone could have the mind to create such a story...it was brilliant but I like a more wholesome story line. The movie in itself as a whole was very well done & acted and was worthy of the rental purchase.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It was ok. On the 1 to 100 it was a 77. A bit long. But all in all it was ok.
B007SGM084|5.0|At first I wasn't sure I was going to really like this book, I had heard all the hype about it but wasn't really into it. I got this as a gift, and the first few chapters I wasn't sure I was even going to finish reading it. But I will admit by chapter 8 I was hooked. It is much more than I expected. Ultimately it is a love story. A story of a man who didn't think he deserved to be loved and a woman who looked past all the faults, and fell in love, with the man, for who he was in his heart. Christian's story line kept me intrigued. I wanted to know what made him the way he was. And it was touching to see how she accepted him and showed him how love can really be. I have read the triology twice now, and am going back for a 3rd go around. I would recommend!! And not for the obvious reasons!
B008JAG9BW|5.0|picture was very clear and great in hd......i recomend amazon streamin movies...i just wished if they could lower the price a little bit...
B00065MDSG|5.0|Larkes Tongues in Aspic is one of the most eclectic, profound, experimental & brilliant hard rocking albums ever. The variation & sonic pallet of the album is simply mind boggling. The songs vary incredibly with L.T. Pt 1 & 2,Exiles & The Talking Drum being the highlights for me in their exceptional composition & execution. This musical opus of King Crimson is a powerful and complex work & truely magnificant. Larks T., is their most accomplised album by the most musically creative & magical incarnation of the band. The cover is an alchemical symbol indicating the merging of male & female energy & I believe this is a metaphor for the synthesis of both the heavy & light musical elements, Western & Eastern elements & possibly the hard rock & classical elements.<br />Even the weakest song Book of Saturday is a languid melodic psy., ballad & is probably needed to counterbalance all  the other diabolically poweful & intense cerebral excursions. This is definately music for the mind rather than the spine. All the band is playing at their peak & they have John Wettons powerful & emotive bass & vocals, the supurb violin playing of David Cross & of course the brilliance of Fripps guitar & mellotron & Bills drumming with a 5th member Jamie Muir adding unbelievable subtle percussion & textures. The remastering is excellent & allows for all the subtle nuances of the work to shine & is easily as good as my original analog record. This is an absolutely outstanding & incredibly well produced and resolved album that just seems to get better and more exciting with each listen. 10/10
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|True to form, Nicholas Sparks has delivered another great novel.  His way with words amazes me and makes me want to read more and more.  He surely has a way with words and one can always know that his books will be written in an entertaining fashion. Thanks again for a wonderful book.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Honestly, I didnt rush to see this film in the theatres but was pleasantly surprised after renting it. I was invested from beginning to end and even shed a tear during a scene or two.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book! At first I was very apprehensive on reading it because its not my choice of reading material. My mother in law and aunt strongly suggested that I read it. I was taken back at first then I just couldn't get enough. The night I finished the first one I immediatly purchased the second book. My husband loves me reading it because I want to be more sexually adventures. He also likes it when I read it to him.<br />I recommend to anyone that wants to explore another type of smart written sexual series.
B008EL4YX6|5.0|Game is very simply designed. It is fun to play. I like the letter grade scoring. Only wish the triangles that you spin would be a little bigger so you could spin them easier.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Read it and enjoy, don't pay attention to negative comments, decide for yourself. Very unique, I loved description of love scenes. Recommending books for all open-minded readers.
B0027BOL4G|1.0|Though the subject matter is important to learn about and the production quality is high I oppose the marketing of this film based on my recent interactions with the media rights company associated with Food, Inc.  The company is called Swank and neither they nor the film's website respond to email requests for permission to view this film.  When contacted by phone and told that we would like to show this film to some club members, (around 20), in the rear room of a nearby coffee shop our Agriculture Club was told that it would cost us $150 and require purchase of the film directly from their company.  For any organization that believes in what it is producing and is serious about the outreach associated with it, fees like this for films that are 4 years old is immoral and strikes me as individuals concerned more about profit than education.
B007AL48UK|4.0|Nice variation of the game but there could have had more sets to play. I will look forward to more sets to be added.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Seeing the Hunger Games on blu-ray is almost as fun as seeing it in the theater. For those of you who did not see it in the theater, the movie is a very good adaptation of the first book (true fans will wish for another 2-3 hours of details :). I would definitely recommend adding this to your movie collection.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Enjoyed the writing style although at first it was a little confusing. The book kept my interest to the end just following the backs and forths to see what would really happen.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I liked this book but I definitely didn't love it.  It was an ok read...not great.  It just seemed like it was lacking something.  There wasn't enough fire in the relationship to me.  I saw where a sequel is coming out from Travis' POV...I honestly don't know if I care enough to purchase it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great, solid app! Pretty detailed information. Would definitely recommend this app to others. Even gives you information you really don't even need to know. :)
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book!! I cannot wait until the next one comes out in October.  It had great character development and just the right amount of romance and fire.  I would recommend this book to anyone who read and liked the Fifty Shades trilogy.  Very similar but I honestly liked the characters a bit more.  Get this book.  You won't be disappointed.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I enjoyed the book.  There is despair, failings, redemption, joy, love and sadness.  Rather than go on and on let me just say if you enjoy true stories about people who have overcome events to become the type of people we should look up to rather than what American society typically chooses i.e. sports or Hollywood this is for you.<br /><br />It is not where you start out or where you have been but rather where you are and most importantly where you are headed that is important and what I got from this book<br /><br />I guess if Adam had not died this would not be the story it ended up being It is a good read but I still would like to see a full length movie.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite books at all times. I laughed, sobbed, and smiled along with all the March girls. It was such a sweet and innocent novel and helped me understand the passage of time.
B002RHGYOA|4.0|enjoyed all 3 books they held my attention all the way thru will look at buying more of these book by this author
B007SGM084|3.0|The book is interesting because of some of the content about kinky sex, but it's also very Harlenquin (sp?) romancy with the writing.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The movie tells the story of the first book in this trilogy. The other two books answers all of the questions the movie left unanswered. I love the trilogy and the amazon quality it is delivered in.
0142420891|5.0|I died when I began reading this! I was sucked into and could not put it down, I just had to know where Mia and Adam were going, had gone, etc. I love the couples who make my heart start beating faster, put butterflies in my tummy and basically essentially make me envious of them. Not even always couples, but the connection between two people. I haven't felt this strong off a connection for a couple in a long time and the way  it was set up and written was just amazing. I mean really can this be turned into a movie?  This book is more the worth your time to read.<br /><br />More Here: [...]
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is wonderful, the first book was beyond wonderful and this on just gets better. basically after i read the first one i was willing to buy the next one even if it was fifty bucks, i can't wait to get to the next. i feel confident saying that these books are the best books i have read this year!
B0019I6WDG|5.0|This movie's sense of humor alaways hits the spot for me. Also, the blu-ray looks great and was a great deal!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|The 4th season, much like the 1st, 2nd and 3rd, will sit you on the edge of your seat and have you begging for more. Loved it!
B000Q79HTC|3.0|It is dated now, particularly from the technology used by characters, but fun to watch before seeing Bourne Legacy now in theaters.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Classic Steven King Novel based on a real event. Time travel through a rabbit hole to 1958 is inspired. A mixture of scifi and suspense with a little Alice in Wonderland thrown in. Great character development.
B000FBJF7I|5.0|Alexander McCall Smith is a wonderful writer. He treats his characters kindly and with gentle humor. The story is told engagingly so one wants to keep reading. He tells a detailed and 3-dimensional story of Africans and Africa. This book continues the \\"No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency\\" series.
B00003CXXP|5.0|The Greatest  Movie ever for the imagination . I'm glad I have it in my collection. I would let other see it. If they haven't<br /><br />You have to see it. At least once.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It was interesting yet not intriguing or totally grabbing me that I would burn to know more. Since it is a topic in my social circle I will continue to book II.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Timely, global reporting! News that US media often does not cover but which affects us all. A welcome feature for Kindle Fire.
B004QO9WVO|3.0|I purchased this \\"audiobook\\" for my Kindle Fire and found out it is NOT an audio book!  However, it is Sherlock Holmes after all, and for that reason, if you enjoy Sherlock Holmes mysteries, you will enjoy it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I had a hard time putting this book down.  I like how it gives you two sides to the story and you're never sure which side is the truth.  It kept me guessing up until the very end.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Even my 8 years old kid can use it for his homework.  It works very well on my kindle. Excellent product, very practical and complete!
B008EQIJQO|4.0|I have always wanted to see a silent B&W flic that looked good in HD and this one really takes the cake. It has a silly story line that just fits a black and white silent format. It is shot well and has good camera work. Its so clean on the screen. The actors do a good job of conveying soundless emotion... Great Movie!!!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Quiet is scholarly but also fascinating, interweaving current scientific research with stories of real people.  Although the focus is on characteristics of introverts, Cain goes beyond the dichotomous distinction between introverts and extroverts to an integrated discussion of multiple dimensions that describe human behavior.  It is not only a scientific analysis but a thoughtful discussion of the complimentary strengths that introverts and extroverts bring to their life situations.  From a personal standpoint, Cain presents ways in which we all can be more accepting of who we are as well as the limits and possibilities of stretching beyond our comfort zones.  I was very captivated by the book!
B0036OODFU|4.0|Great movie of life in the 70s traveling with a rock and roll band. Some great music and a cute story line with a charming ending. Makes one what to be young once again and on the road.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|This book starts wierd and is hard to get into but once you do it's hard to put down.  A must read if you liked the first book.  I had to know what happened to the Hive Queen.
B001EBWINQ|4.0|Sadly, I had never, ever seen this \\"classic\\".  I remedied that situation and enjoyed the movie!  Not an all time favorite, but definite chemistry between the leads.
B008602KQI|4.0|I found the movie to be a little long and draggy. It was important I guess to set the nation as it was then. Enjoyed it after the action started.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|My sister recommended this book to me, and it sounded like a good story.  Since it was 800 pages long, I opted for the Kindle version.  I just couldn't see toting around a book that big!  It was a very good story, kept my attention all the way through.  I am not a big Stephen King fan, but this was nothing like his typical books, this was an interesting novel, well worth the time to read from \\"cover to cover\\".
B008XG1X18|1.0|I'm using this app on my kindle fire and it crashes ALL THE TIME. It's not very comprehensive and leaves much to be desired with the user. This app needs a lot of work... if you must pintrest... just use the website instead of this app and you will be much happier.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book kept me o my toes - a real page turner and a trick at every turn.  I thought the ending was a little weak and seemed to set itself up for a sequel but the story was addicting.  Hard to put down!!
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Absolutely fabulous. The Well of Ascension, Book 2 was even better than the first one. I highly recommend this trilogy.
B006M6NUBC|2.0|As much as I am a fun of action movies, this one was rather boring and predictable. Please some plot is required. Yes, sure there was one but it was completely lame as well as the total invincibility projected sucked out all of the potential suspense.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game, really challenging when you get to the higher levels. Yes its possible to beat! I defiantly recommend this game for everyone (if you like a little challenge)  GET IT!!! :)
B008602KQI|5.0|It's the Hunger Games - the movie based on the book. The adaptation is extraordinary and I am personally impressed that there was no loss of focus on the strength of the female lead - Katniss. Anyone who has seen the movie should read the book, and if you have read the book without seeing the movie, you will be amazed!
B0014D6PCO|5.0|The blue ray is great and the added comic inside is cool.  Great first movie of the series.  I have The Dark Knight and obviously awaiting the 3rd
B004P4S4NM|3.0|I should have purchased this CD when it first came out. Now, I've already heard most of the songs before I downloaded it. It's still an amazing CD. Adele sounds even better when on a CD versus a radio. Still, there wasn't enough new content to warrant me buying the disk.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This is a very fun game. I play this game on my Kindle Fire and my iPhone. Great for when you are waiting in the doctor's office as it is easy to pause and pick up later.
B007P3TMW2|5.0|Great feel good movie appropriate for the whole family Tom Hanks is awesome as usual. have the tissues handy you have been warned
B0064NTZJO|1.0|I've you want to feel like you have wasted 2 hours of your life, then get this movie. Boring, without a plot, and without sense.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|Wheather it be your first time seeing this or your tenth, it's still enjoyable through and through.  Now it's time to watch Rear Window again!
B00136NXMM|5.0|If you play guitar or even like guitar this is a must have CD! Chet and Mark are great together.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I am so pleased I received my purchase when promised and I love this production. It's a classic story that everyone should know. The music was wonderful, the cosumes gorgeous and the affects amazing. I loved the ending when the original cast came on and then hundreds of high school students who had performed the story marched onto the stage. I highly recommend this dvd.
B003B02PFO|3.0|A so so novel.<br />Not up to John's usual books.<br />Had an unexpected conclusion by not skipping Christmas.<br />Not a \\"Must Read.\\"
B0088TG252|2.0|Lots of action, very unbelivable. Really not up to Benzel's standard. Not worth the money or the time to watch it.
B000WCDBKM|4.0|Quirky movie with moments of dark humour. If you like Depp, then you'll like his performance in this movie as well. Enjoy it for what it is.
B008602KQI|4.0|Very good.... Story is good along with the acting...lots of action and high drama. Well worth the money. Special effect is so so but overall, good.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I loved the book's honesty. Chris didn't hide the way he felt about anything. It makes you see how things were there and understand the way the enemy thought about us. I 'm Proud to be a American.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Very good read.  Inhumane villans you love to hate.  Heroines and heroes with tender hearts as well as intestinal fortitude.  A look at the contrasting good and bad of past southern plantations and the people who mastered and the people who served.
B004JQN364|4.0|I got this for my son. And he loves it...the only thing...I broke two pieces while playing with him (easy fix just need super glue) When I was trying to cram the ax in the hand where the sword goes I accidently popped off the little armor on his arm. Easy fix and Plus I wasn't being very nice when I was cramming it in there. And I also broke the sword...oops. I hid that from my son, still waiting to get super glue. But it's all easy fix. Awesome toy. You can take the weapons on and off and his mouth opens up and closes. If your kids are in to this kind of stuff, I high recommend this toy.
B008JH5CVS|5.0|I've always been a fan of scfy & action films, but I was really afraid this film would drag into a hostage film.  But much to my pleasure I found it to be quite enjoyable as a scfy and action thriller movie.  I give it two thumbs up!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hi so enjoyed the \\"HUNGER GAMES\\".~!!  Great book and great reading.~!!!!  Hard to put down and loved the ending.~!!!!<br /><br />Would highly recommend this book to all.~!!!
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I was looking forward to watching this movie because I had heard good reviews about it.  They were spot on.  This was an awesome movie.  It had action, romance, a good story line, and mysteries that you want to learn about and figure out.  Both my boyfriend and I really enjoyed watching this movie.  It was a good story and well done.  (If it helps, we had never read the John Carter books, or even heard of them, until this movie.  Though I do like good adventure and/or fantasy or sci-fi books and movies.)
B00846REIS|4.0|This book seems as if it the tamed down version of 50 Shades of Grey.  The story line is VERY similar.  I can not wait for book 2, Reflected in You, to be release in October.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This one was my favorite of the three books. She needs to make a fourth right now and I really hope whoever they pick for Christian in the movies lives up to my expectations and the bar is high
B004ADH1RI|3.0|This movie is an early project of Spielberg which hints at but does not expose the genius aspects of his works yet to come. It has its moments but ultimatly fails to impress in a meaningful way. It is also notable to see some actors who will go on to much greater heights to follow.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|It's kind of additive.  My only complaint would be that I got to a certain level (somewhere in the sixties)  and it randomly restarted.
B0041D843M|5.0|This book has the detailed research and other professionals including reputable Doctors to back up the truth that the meat industry has paid off Govt and the health care system to hurt the American people through what we eat . awesome book !
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game its so awesome espeascially roneo and Juliet. its not even a rip&ndash;off! wohoo! wohoo! its awesome
B003O86FMW|4.0|Caatching Fire is a fast read and an intersting sequel to The Hunger Games.  Collins is masterful in her development of characters.
B001DUGOWY|5.0|You may have read this when you were young.  But it is a wonderful re-read as you get older.  I could hardly put it down.  I re-read 3 of John's books this summer and what fun!  They relate to today as well as when they were written.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very good read....hard to put it down (stayed up late many nights reading these books). A great series! Warning- this is an erotic romance!
B008602KQI|4.0|Liked the movie but was let down by the ending.  Have seen better endings with movies that are to become a series.
B001CL4N68|5.0|This is a classic Nas album and a classic rap album. If you are a Nas fan this should already be in your collection. If you are not a Nas fan, one play of this album will make you an instant FANactic.
B004GYY714|5.0|It is my favorite radio app so far. It is very nice to be able to listen to any station in the world at any time.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone girl was an engrossing thriller with many imaginative twists and turns. It really held my interest and I would look forward to reading more books by this author.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book is amazing if you're looking for a steamy read. Once I started reading I could not put it down. Definitely a page turner! Can't wait for the sequel!
B002NZTZ8S|3.0|This was bought for a Christmas present, so I am not opening it to review it before giving it to our granddaughter. I will review it after that!
B004T4LUPW|3.0|I rate it as adequate but I am very disappointed that I had to get it.  I wanted to be able to view my calendar in my hotmail account.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Four stars instead of five because it's not dummy proof (I am a case in point).  I thought about buying a more expensive type (such as the Ephrem's), but thought I'd give this a try since it's only $20.<br /><br />I thought I assembled it according to the instructions and tried it on 3 wine bottles each of which didn't break cleanly using the hot water / ice bath technique others have described in detail.<br /><br />Frustrated, I put the G2 in the garage for a few days and then reexamined the instructions and found out that I didn't have it assembled exactly as it should have been.  I was still dubious that it would now magically work and pulled out several bottles to give it another try - again using the hot / cold water bath.  Surprise!!  They all came apart just as expected with very clean breaks right on the score line.  Also, a couple of these wine bottles had very thick glass walls - not all wine bottles are created equal!<br /><br />I've now done about a dozen bottles and after the first 3 which didn't work, the rest broke apart very cleanly.  It's actually pretty easy to use; just have to follow directions.  My wife would tell you this is not a strong suit of mine.<br /><br />The cut off wine bottles make for nice tea light holders in our backyard; I'm sure we'll find other uses for them too.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|They should have kept the name the same as the book, then I am sure it would have done much better in the theater!
B005IT0V8O|3.0|The kindest thing to say about this edition is that it is classic and cheap.  If you're serious about writing, you'd probably do better to purchase a more recent edition.  English is dynamic.  Acceptable usage changes.  Yes, there are some rules that have persisted. And, you could do worse in choosing your writing style. But, the time you invest in improving your command of the written language represents the greater cost.  Spending a few dollars on an up-to-date style manual adds value to that investment far in excess of the cost of the book.
B000TERJQ0|5.0|This is a great classical album of improvized music, which normally isn't done with classical music.  She's done a great job of keeping the original harmonies of Bach, but really going off in  beautiful and fun directions with the music.<br />I highly recommend this CD.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was disappointed in this book.  It was slow getting into, then became very interesting and I was truly absorbed and then I was very disappointed with the ending. I almost felt as if the author didn't know how to get out of the situation she had created, and simply decided to put down her \\"pen.\\" It made me angry with the women on The View who really raved about the book and did such a good job that I bought it immedieatey.
B0011EU0NG|4.0|Loved the movie, great kids movie and family movie.  Recommended for all ages.  Dick Van Dyke will crack up every time in a movie.  Must see movie.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|No Easy Day was an absolute page turner! I bought it pre-release, and finished it in less than a day. I'll also spend time re-reading it for fun in a week or so. The Author wrote a stellar book without compromising tactics or security and his mission-accounts are matter of fact with pure professionalism shining through.<br />In my callow youth, I was a soldier and SWAT Team member. I got a taste of the spirit of a team and we all saved each others lives repeatedly and made light of it. Nowhere was it \\"safe\\" and almost nothing was \\"sacred.\\"<br />The SEAL behind the pseudonym of Mark Owen gives us a snapshot of what it's like to be among the \\"best of the best!\\" Accomplishing the dangerous and historic missions with equal calm and competence. And Mark Owen is so selfless, he's donating the proceeds from the book to SEAL Charities! God bless him and his comrades at arms. I wish them all the greatest success in their missions and their lives.
B0081L37Z0|4.0|Another great movie that we rented on our RoKu.  We laughed and were truly enjoying the movie all the way through while slightly predictible it was still a good movie!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pinterest! this app is decent but there are a few glitches that could be worked on. mine likes to freeze quite often. but all in all I'm glad that they made this app! it is actually what made me decide to make a pinterest account.
B008JAGZDE|5.0|We were going to my husbands reunion the following weekend right after watching this movie... I was hoping for a similiar reunion while i was slightly... or extrememly disappointed in my husbands reunion i LOVED this movie!  it was great and we enjoyed another great AMERICAN PIE movie!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Obviously, the author played Fallout, and thought the Vaults were a tremendous idea, and saw the possibilities of great storytelling from the perspective of people ACTUALLY living in them, as opposed to escaping them. A good idea should be copied about as many times as it stays good, and this is no exception.<br />The author expertly describes life in the Silo, so much that I truly did feel as though I was there many times, and the characters are well-written, both believable in their motivations and personalities. I was literally unable to put this book down except for sleep and work for the several days it took me to blast through it. While the story doesn't end on a cliffhanger, this is one tale that clearly remains unfinished.<br />The only critical point that I have is that to the experienced Sci-Fi reader, many of the plot hooks are foreseeable, this didn't detract from my experience too much, but the lack of big surprises (to me, personally) is the reason I have given this four stars instead of five. You may feel differently.<br />Last word is: this is a great book for someone who is interested in Post-Apoc, or wants to introduce someone to Post-Apoc settings, but doesn't want all the mutants and Road Warrior things. This is a good, human story (with some action) told in a very believable Post-Apocalyptic world.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book from front to back, kept me entertained the entire time. can't wait to start the next book soon
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought the first book was good, but this second one was even better - can't wait to get the third one!
B005NKGEP2|3.0|This book had potential.  The initial setup is interesting and the writing is good.  However, the story devolves into fantasy and it becomes increasingly difficult to suspend disbelief.  I am willing to give this author another try, but would expect a effort with more substance.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was great.  My daughter loved it.  I bought it and got the digital download and now we can watch it in different places at the same time.
B004478GN8|5.0|We used this toy as a prize for our son to learn to do his reading lessons.  It is a great addition to all the star wars lego pieces that he already has available.  The blue storm troopers look cool and are unique to the collection that he has acquired from his other Lego sets.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|So far great book can't put it down!! Keeps you wanting to turn the page! A good mix of humor, drama and twists!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I found this trilogy by accident and ended up reading all three is less than two weeks.  I loved the history mix with fantasy/science fiction.  The characters were ones you were rooting for and each twist and turn brought you more deeply into their realm.  Would recommend to vampire lovers and history lovers alike.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I put off reading this book because \\"romance\\" books are not my favorite.  I prefer mystery's.  A friend of mine kept telling me I had to read it.  I did enjoy the book for what it is.  I read the reviews before I downloaded it and was surprised with the reviews that it is sophomoric.  It is a good book for the type of book it is.  It has a story line that keeps you engaged through out.  From what I understand most erotica is like watching an X rated movie.  This book has a actual story line - go figure.<br /><br />I will read book two in between my next mystery books. Nice fantasy break.
B007VGXS8M|4.0|If you enjoyed Where's Waldo books when you were a child this game is for you. It has great pictures just like the book. There were some spots that you would tag and not work unless you tagged it more than a couple of times. I did find this game enjoying for me and my four year old.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is the first time I had read a novel by this particular author, and I was deeply impressed by how it grabbed my attention and kept it throughout the story.  I even found myself reading at stoplights in the city!  I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next, and I was never disappointed!  I'll be looking for other novels by Gillian Flynn; she is extremely talented.
B003IDMUX6|3.0|The book started on a promising note and I thought it would be similar to something like playing for pizza/ Calico Joe. However, Grisham seems to have run out of ideas midway on how to end the book. And therefore the rather abrupt ending with everyone coming together to support a Merry Christmas. After one finishes the book, you get the feeling that something was missing.
B002R88G5E|5.0|Confronting, even painful at times to read; and yet, so compelling I couldn't put it down. I believe this to be an excellent eye opener to things we can not see in this culture, an culture we think we know everything about.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the book, especially the obscure 80's references. I downloaded the sample first<br />As I had never heard of the author<br />Before but now I can't wait for more. A good mix of drama, action, and humor with some Sci-fi added in
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Great classic and fun for the whole family!!! I bought it for my four children to enjoy! It was an all time favorite of mine as a child myself!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great app!!!  I really like that it keeps a running total and that you can just keep subtracting from the new answer!
B006OITIQE|5.0|I absoulutly loved their up sll night album. I would love any album they put out. Niall is my favorite but i love them all. Direction Infection!!!!<br /><br /><3 Turtle
B008XG1X18|1.0|It would be a great app if it worked! It constantly freezes when I repin & only loads about 40% of the time since the recent update.  Soooooooo frustrating! Please fix app!  Too many error messages lately.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book kept me riveted by the \\"what ifs\\" -- what if Kennedy's death could have been prevented? What would happen if someone changed the past, even a little bit? Told masterfully by Stephen King, this story of an English teacher/time traveler was an insightful look at the times. I haven't read anything by Stephen King since \\"The Shining,\\" and now I'm his biggest fan. I can't wait to read more of his books.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|I can't review this because the app won't load on the iPod...I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling about ten times and it never works so I guess my review is that it SUCKS!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|The pinterest app is in my oppinion better than the actual website. Very easy to use. Great for tablet use because you can see all the pins without having to zoom out, you can pin to your boards much better (when using my kindle to pin on the website I could only scroll to 3 of my boards the other boards were unreachable), rtc. I highly recommend this app!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Very disappointed in this book.  Written in the style of some hopelessly in love teenager.<br /><br />Redeemable only for its smut value.  The story line is not here.  I won't bother to read the other two.
0439023513|1.0|If anyone remembers the J J Abrams produced and directed series ALIAS with Jennifer Garner I believe you'll identify a similar downward trajectory with this Collins series. Starts off with brilliantly developed and sympatheic characters and descends into ridiculous nonsense. Two strong female protaganists in each, wonderful empowering story lines and at the end-WTF? Book One of this trilogy was amazing. Someone suggested I read this \\"young adult\\" fiction and when I finally got around to it, I was so impressed and engaged with the lovely writing and character development. As with ALIAS' final season, when Abrams was off developing his series LOST, I feel that Collins was absolutely not present for MOCKINGJAY. The tedious action sequences, completely implausible plot lines, the total absence of heart. I don't mind sad endings, or middles at all. Just don't turn your back on all of your hard work heretofore Ms. Collins. This was phoned in to an incompetent editor. Enjoy the undeserved profits, but I will not purchase another title by you. THE HUNGER GAMES was as fantastic as MOCKINGJAY is awful. What a tragedy for your readers. Shame.
B008602KQI|4.0|It wasn't what I expected to much bull and not enough action,But what action was there was great for the most part.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|WOW! What a wonderful album. Really great songs to listen to while you mow the lawn. Makes time fly while you are swinging those hips.
630542845X|5.0|I'm a late commer to this movie. I ran into it while browsing my movie channels. I was amazed after seeing it. I am a Near Death survivor and there is a lot of Wisdom in this movie. The music is also very good. All the actors are just perfect, especially Powder.<br /><br />I think every middle school should show this movie to their students. It portrays bullying in its coldest form. Powder is a very kind and loving, advanced human being. And for the people around him to act as they did must have been what Christ faced.<br /><br />I bought the 2010 DVD and will watch it always. It is on top of all my other movies, right on top of Always.<br /><br />Taos Guy
B005898DDO|4.0|I found Scorsese's treatment of this complex genius nuanced and riveting. It reawakened dormant memories from a long time ago, filling it blanks with fascinating, behind the scenes details from people who worked with and around Dylan in those times. I stumbled on this video which I hadn't known existed, and found it to be a most welcome unexpected gift.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This series is great!  Love Mr. Grey in all his kinkery!  lol It's defenatly a page turner. I have read this series in like three wk.  Would strongly recommend anyone to read it.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|She is such a fine writer that she draws you in completely even when the subject matter is disturbing. This story and this main character was very compelling from start to finish.  Outstanding.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey takes the reader on a sensual journey...explores a side of intimacy few have personally experienced...opens another level of social dialogue...tastefully erotic.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|We have been enjoying \\"Game of Thrones\\" and in fact are on book Five as we speak.  The writer keeps you informed on all the facts from the times of the Kings, it is  educational as well as interesting, fascinating and riveting!!  Love it, love it, love it!!
B007Z9QS5K|3.0|This movie was a typical romantic movie.  Though it was an enjoyable movie, it's not one that I would watch over and over.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I got this book so I could see what the fuss was about, but I haven't managed to get past chapter 6 (in retrospect I wonder how I managed to get that far). The writing style is just terrible: short sentences with no sense of flow between them. Sometimes I had difficulty comprehending what the author was trying to say due to the style.<br /><br />I can't really comment on the other aspects of the book, due to the fact that I haven't read past chapter 6, but honestly if you have any standards when it comes to writing I would avoid this book. I will have to try the movie some time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Best Book I have read in a really long time! I would come home from work excited to read these!
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Fascinating documentary of devotion to craft.  Explores the world of sushi through the life of one of the last masters.
B00846REIS|3.0|You are left not really knowing what her boyfriend's condition is exactly.  Also who would go to couple's counseling after knowing someone a week?  The way the book ended, I thought there were some pages missing from my kindle copy.  I was very disappointed.  The girl's story about what had happened to her in the past was good, but the boyfriend's condition was very vague and why did he have it?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book made me think what I like and how far I will go its a very good book I will advise everyone to read it and learn from it
B007T99ENE|5.0|In Sweet Tooth Ian McEwan has once again demonstrated what a master he is at storytelling.  A novelist who can force you to forsake sleep in order to get to the climax of his opus is indeed rare these day, but Ian McEwan, in my opinion, is one of these.  Don't fail to get this book and NOW.
B002B3WEO4|5.0|\\"Wildflowers\\" is a terrific record. It sounds like a GREAT Heartbreakers record...so much so, in fact, that I honestly cannot understand what delineates the difference (as Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench are all over the record)? Be that as it may, this is one of Petty's best albums- it is wall-to-wall amazing tunes...I love the dry, up front mix and starkness of the production. Typical of Rick Rubin productions, the record sounds very live. This is a welcome feature to the Heartbreakers as their glowing elegance has only been watered down by some of the trendy production techniques employed on their previous records. The dynamic range of the music is impressive as well: there are some tougher rock grooves, some soul,  as well as Petty's breezy Byrd-esque folk rock. The record is so good that even the folks who are lukewarm to Petty's relaxed drawl are sure to find something to love on \\"Wildflowers\\".
B008602KQI|3.0|The movie wasn't bad.  I wish it could have been more like the book. Not to say, the movie didn't get the main points across, it just seemed it was missing too much of the book. It seemed the movie was fast forwarded.  I realize that a movie is 1-2 hours and only so much can come from a book that takes all day to read.  But a few more scenes about Katnis' true love, a little more about her sister, a little more about the fights in the arena, a little more of what led up to the Captitol taking over the Hunger Games would have been good.  I guess if one did not read the book first, then the movie, I am sure, would have been better.
B000LGZHDS|3.0|I love the imaginative colors on this crazy little snail. Surreal!  I'm glad to have him around. I didn't even know it was a Spongebob character; my six-year-old granddaughter had to tell me. :-)
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the change of perspective for every chapter even if the 1st part of the story seamed almost too obvious. After the dramatic change in the second part, I couldn't let go of the book!
B004GUSG4M|3.0|This was a fun page turner but I had a good idea of the twist by the third or fourth chapter
B00846REIS|2.0|Not a good book, seems to be bits/pieces stolen from 50 shades:(  But I will probably buy the sequel if it comes out.
B00436ENU0|4.0|Having grown up in the Americas, the history of some some parts of the world is completely unknown to me. This book makes me want to learn more about the wars in Asia. The story is very well told and gives a voice to some people who had none, and perhaps think they do not need one. Too bad it seems like this very story consumed the author to the point of costing her her life.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I did not see the movie but sure look forward to it now.  This book grabs you right from the start and transports you ahead to a time you can believe is possible.  A must read for all.
B007G92QGO|5.0|I read the book on my Kindle after reading the reviews about it and it was worth the money spent. A psychological thriller with many twists and turns, it grabbed my attention from the start and I read it through in one sitting. This is my first book. By the author and I plan to read his previous books now.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a very gripping book.  The author's ingenious way of capturing and portraying mental illness was phenomenal.  I couldn't put it down.  I didn't particularly enjoy the ending but not all books end on a happy note, and this is particularly true when dealing with disturbed characters.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you enjoyed Fifty Shades of Grey,  you will love Bared to You.  Both books are very similar and I couldn't stop reading....I can't wait for next book!!!!
B004PGNB1K|4.0|Loved ot, but the first book was good,.not great. The stuff.in the Fae although interesting just kind of happen out of no where then you just go...ok then...next? Hmmm still.awesome, 4 stars.
B000FC2L1E|3.0|too many coincidences & sex scenes are rather amateurish and long.  I felt like \\"get on with it\\"  and skipped many pages.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|A \\"helpful\\" serial killer... the concept alone is interesting. This season was better than last. Won't give details, but I was really hoping it would end the way it did....
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|An essential spare part for a Kindle fire.  Before some wiseacre mentions it, of course there are generics out there and they are cheaper and many of them actually work. As a general rule, I believe you get what you pay for. If you load your vehicle with the cheapest spark plugs, plug wires, filters, gas, oil etc. that you can find, that all adds up and the best vehicle out there will run like a Yugo with a bullet through the block. If you spend $200.00 on a Kindle Fire, why risk damaging the ports or otherwise screwing up something valuable just so you can post online about how brilliant you are?
B008ASLK8A|2.0|Just going thru their motions<br />Lack of humor , humility , and lacks a story that's interesting<br />Tired of the acting<br />Tired of a formula movie . This movie goes thru the motions . B.  o.  R. I. N. g. !
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie not just for teens and young adults.  I would recommend reading the book first but the movie stays true to the book.[[ASIN:B0084IG7KC The Hunger Games [2-Disc Blu-ray + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]]]
1476712042|5.0|This was my 2nd YA book and I am HOOKED. I couldn't get enough of this book. Read it in 2 days. I even had to hide my kindle and dim the light all the way down so I could read it in bed and not wake my husband!! It's such an engrossing story you will get sucked right in. The characters are great and believable.I've already pre orderd Walking disaster!!! I may even re-read it...I just fell in love with it.
B0011Z5IVE|5.0|New music still can't beat a classic album like this. This is a testament to the genius of Jimmy Page, and Robert Plant. They may get older, but you just can't best their chemistry.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wasn't crazy about the beginning format, but by the time the real story started I was hooked.  Knowing the ending could go in one of several directions, I couldn't stop reading till I found out.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|Just a bunch of random babbling that didn't interest me in the least.  I didn't find the humor in it at all either.
B00280LYIC|5.0|If you want something to get and keep your kids interested in reading, the Percy Jackson series is it. Action, interesting mythology and engaging dialogue all make them want to keep turning pages. My oldest son is rereading them for the second or third time.
B005IQZB14|4.0|If you've ever fantasized about chucking it all in and going to hike in the woods for months on end, this is the book for you. Cheryl Strayed does just that, and learns a few things on the way.
B008A1NSTG|4.0|This is a great family movie. My sons (10 & 13) watched this with me and we all loved it. It's a heartfelt story and has some humor to it.  I would recommend watchin it if u are an animal lover.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Collins continues the story-line she started in book 1 by upping the stakes and expanding our view of the dystopian world she created. You'll race through it and then buy the next one.

B005U3V7MC|3.0|I wanted to love this book. I love PD James. I love Jane Austen. I really love Pride and Prejudice. But while the premise was interesting and, as always, the mystery was deftly plotted, I ended up wishing that James had left Austen alone and told us more, instead, about her own wonderful detective, Dalgliesh.
B00338QENI|3.0|First half of book is fascinating history; I wish I hadn't read 2nd half re author's interaction with daughter Deborah and extended family.  They came across as insufferable and totally unsympathetic.  In agreement with another reviewer about the extremely lengthy material, thanks and so forth at end of book.  The author must believe she's written a book for the ages!  Wish I hadn't read it!
B008PZ69RU|2.0|The tagline for Magnolia Pictures \\"360\\" is \\"Everything comes full circle.\\" That's really about the only thing \\"360\\" has going for it. \\"City of God\\" director Fernando Meirelles is at the helm with a cast that includes Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Ben Foster, and Anthony Hopkins. The unfortunate thing is these actors really only feel like they're filling a void and don't really make themselves totally useful.<br /><br />\\"360\\" jumps all over the world; Vienna, Bratislava, Paris, London, Colorado, and finally Phoenix. Seeing how all of the characters connect to one another is really the only drawing factor of the film. You're mostly left feeling like you could've spent a lot more time with certain characters instead of being introduced to so many. Ben Foster is a great example. His character just begins to get interesting when you only see him briefly in montages for the rest of the film. Anthony Hopkins has one really emotional scene during an AA meeting, but mostly feels underused. Jude Law and Rachel Weisz are criminally under-featured. Weisz seems to be rehashing her performance from \\"The Deep Blue Sea\\" except Rose is a watered down version of Hester Collyer. Meanwhile, Michael Daly (Law) mostly just acts suspicious and then kind of just admits to everything in the long run without much effort. It all just feels so fruitless.<br /><br />How these characters are connected aren't really all that interesting the majority of the time. More often than not, somebody is cheating on somebody else. Aside from Tyler (Foster) and the Older Man (Hopkins), being unfaithful or using sex to make a living is an underlying theme for everyone else. It's just really disappointing. \\"360\\" initially has this \\"21 Grams\\" meets \\"Closer\\" kind of potential and yet isn't nearly as good as either of those films.<br /><br />The drama is edited in a really unique way though. Its execution is a little odd, but is also really intriguing. At certain points in the film, the camera will show several characters on screen at once despite being in different areas of the world. So the screen will be divided into four vertical strips that are devoted to one specific character. Later on, during a phone call, the screen is divided into two horizontal strips featuring both individuals on the phone; one in each strip. The most interesting is when Sergei (Vladimir Vdovichenkov) is driving through a tunnel. The lights in the tunnel begin swirling around the screen which eventually transitions to the side of a parked car. It's just a very unusual editing technique.<br /><br />\\"360\\" feels a bit too overzealous for its own good. While connecting so many characters to one another is extremely impressive on one hand, the characters themselves mostly feel very flat and underdeveloped overall. The film makes good on its promise of coming full circle, but there are so many half written stories in between that the experience leaves you feeling like there's no substance whatsoever.<br /><br />\\"360\\" comes off as introductory without much filling. The intersection is one thing, but what about the road that gets you there? Shouldn't you have time to admire the scenery and get to know at least one person at more than face value during the adventure? \\"360\\" is a carousel that gets caught up in its own whirlwind and doesn't utilize or know how to appreciate its talent properly.ters on screen at once despite being in different areas of the world.

B001O1O71C|5.0|This was required reading for my sixth grade son.  Obviously the topic of the atrocities of the concentration camps of WW11 is a tough one for any age group, but a child maybe even more so.  But the author does a wonderful job of presenting the material through the eyes and perspective of two young innocent boys and gets the point of the extreme tragedy of the situation without gratuitous violence or language. I do recommend this book.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I have two daughters who love this series.  The books and the TV show.  The CDs we purchased from Amazon were in great condition.  No issues at all.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|[[ASIN:1587264129 Wuthering Heights]] I read it in high school and decided to reread it.I'd forgotten the story of this Bronte \\"classic.  It's extremely well-written but very depressing.
B007SGM084|5.0|This books was a delight to read from begginig till end. Once you start reading you cannot put the book down. It gives you a story that it lets you fantasize and wonder if there is really a Chridtian Grey out there. Story line was good and so easy to follow. I love that a person like Ana can change a mens life and put it prospective, once he finds out what love is. Great story great books I love the reading, was a job well done, and I have read the books twice. Recommend all my friends to read it they will love it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Absolutely fantastic!!! I hope this isn't the last book! Especially the ending, there has to be more! I can't say enough good things about this trilogy.
B006VA3ZEG|5.0|i can't get enough of this show, literally, i'm not lying at all! and it's coming back soon which should be nice
B003EY7IRC|3.0|I read these types of books for the little mini-vacation from reality they provide. My preference is to escape to a world that is different and more exciting than my soccer mom life.  This book kept me on the edge of my seat and was a fast-paced read.  Unfortunately, the world Moning created and wraps-up in this book was really kind of sucky.  There was little joy, little celebration, little climax for all of the suspenseful build-up.  If you have made it all the way through the series, I imagine everyone could review it horribly and you would still read it.  If, however, you are reading this review prior to starting the series, you may want to pass...or make sure you're in a good place emotionally. I wish I had never read the first book and started down the road that ended at this place. Too much angst and stress. Glad all these books were out by the time I found them. I feel sorry for the fans that waited for this finale.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've watched it 3 times and my family also watched it twice.
B007SGM084|5.0|This trilogy is amazing. It is a wonderful love story with spices! It is easy to read! It is a Must Read! I read it twice and I will read a third!
B007OUINLC|5.0|I'm a retired psychologist who was in private practice for 25 years.  I'm usually drawn to any movie with a psychological bent, but most either treat psychologists as weirdos or present simplistic answers to difficult mental questions.  This movie did neither.  The material was complex, yet inviting, and kept me involved throughout.  But, it's not just for us professionals.  It's simply a highly-engaging movie in its own right.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All 3 books were good.  Book #1 was the \\"hook\\"..I had to read #2.  I could have lived without #3, but I'm glad I read it.  In addition to lots of sex, there was a good story line.
B0086DBE62|5.0|My boys five and eight years old loved it. It's got a little bit of romance and cool dueling for the boys!!  That's funny too!!  I definitely recommend it!!
B004TI5N38|5.0|Typical Baldacci...a real page turner!  David Baldacci is one of my favorite authors and I am never disappointed in his product!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Past , present and possible future problems of our world is successufly illustrated by writer and quickly transfered into reader's imagine with plain language. I liked this book very much..
B0031RS4UM|5.0|What can I say, great read, typical start and keep reading non stop until finished. I have read them all and never once been bored.
B0083GQKQG|2.0|The only really good performance in this movie was the actor who played Kevin. My daughter has read the book and says it's really good. I did not find the female lead in this appealing. I hope there are no real women out there who are such doormats. Movie jumps around too much. Don't waste your money; buy the book instead.
B008602KQI|5.0|Was going to buy this on blue ray, but streaming is so much more convenient for me. Very good quality picture and sound.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book was very interesting. I usually don't like books written in first person, but this book was written pretty well. I cared about both characters and wanted to see them together.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Loved the story line, the scenery, and the cast. It was definitely a feel good movie. I wish there were more movies like this one.<br /><br />Z
B0037QM8YA|5.0|Great movie...would watch again and also recommend it. Watched it for school (case management) take time to see what this young last struggled with
B004Q3QRWC|2.0|I was intrigued by this book at first but as it went on I lost interest and struggled to finish it.  One of the final chapters is only graphics which looked good in book format but didn't work so well with my Kindle.  The story is overly intricate and it just didn't appeal to me.  I read this book as part of a book club and, while some people liked it more than others, no one really loved it but it did provoke quite a bit of discussion.<br /><br />In summary, it's ok but if I was recommending a book to someone I probably wouldn't think to mention this one.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The app works great.  It is nice to have it available when I'm not close to my computer and need to look up something on my boards.  Works nicely on my iPad.  I definitely recommend it!
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is awesome. I mean, if  you're into kids brutally murdering each other. Besides that the plot is really good and keeps you watching.
B008476HBM|5.0|One of the best reads this summer.  Great writing, story brings you back in time when people actually had manners.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I like that all my devotional books are all in one place. l like the audio element, so I can read and listen too. be nice if the devotionals were a little deeper more challenging.
B001J9EHSC|5.0|Fiona is one angry and honest songwriter. Plus a fantastic piano player. She touches my soul. In a way few musicians can.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a great game. Has a tutorial and hints if you get stuck. Very relaxing and great exercise for your brain.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|After many frustrating attempts to formatting my e-books for Kindle, this book took my straight through.  Reading it from my Kindle I was able to go step by step as I formatted my book. Good job!<br />[[ASIN:B008RLVTBI How to Be a Good Wife: Secrets for a Happy Marriage]]<br />[[ASIN:B0086ZCVZ8 All About Wheatgrass.

B008IYSMLY|1.0|I ordered this to be watched on my instant queu, it was so pixelated it was terrible, then it would stop to load.  I watched other movies and videos without problem just to make sure it wasn't my connection or hardware.
B00006AW2L|4.0|The DVD was shipped carefully, arrived on time. The dvd plays well. i am very happy with this purchase. Good job
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl: A Novel was a great book!  It was hard to put down!  I highly recommend it!  My book club is loving it too!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This book was very interesting, I learned a lot about the military and how things are run.  The writing was not very professional. I know it was written by a sniper, but it could have been edited better so it had a more natural flow.
B008602KQI|3.0|Read the books and loved them!  Thought this movie would be great, but it was a let down. I thought it was slow moving and just went through the motions.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This book has too much emphasis on the sexual trysts and not enough on the story-line. We get that he's messed up but it's like reading between the lines to understand his past.
B007JRU2UK|5.0|Great story, great performances, and the streaming was pretty good, too, considering I have a half-decent wireless router. Definitely would watch it again!
B000Q76K1A|4.0|Other than the appearance of the case(bent and broken spine on the slip cover), the dvds were just fine.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|An interesting but troubled character. I really felt sorry for her, but didn't like her much. I do appreciatae flowers more and was glad the character got over herself by the end of the novel.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|A novel that many people need to read since it reveals the truth about the terrible culture Muslim women have to live in! Your heart will break as you grasp the descriptions of the cruelty and hatred of Muslim men toward their wives. Seems like you are in another day and age, not in what exists in modern Muslim countries that still embrace Shariah (sp.) law.  The heroic conclusion of the novel brings some hope for those women who eventually decide to break away from that terrible suppression. Also read \\"The Kite Runner\\", penned by the same author. Our book club will review the book this month.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|Great songs and music. A bit more 'grown up' than other Disney animated films. My 18 month old loves the characters too. Recommended for everyone!
B008BM9L72|1.0|If you like steamy scenes and flimsy stories, in which the phrases \\"Oh my!\\", \\"Holy Sh*t!\\" and \\"Holy Cow!\\" are horribly overused, this is the book for you! By the end of the trilogy I was skimming the sex scenes to get to the bits with a story. I bought it because I wanted to see what the fuss was about, and I imagine that its huge worldwide sales are largely due to this phenomenon, rather than the rivetting story and well drawn characters. Then again, a lot of people liked the Macarena dance too.
B007Q476KU|5.0|thought the movie was everything I was hoping for and was surprised and sad. and enjoyed it<br />wanted to get up and help him through the field. thought the townpeople were terrible and wanted to shoo them away. for not helping
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|You had to have read the book before watching it. It helps to clarify reasons for different scenes and the significance of them.
B008LXZEYU|4.0|What can I say? He is \\"Ron Burgundy\\"...If you enjoy Will Ferrel, you will love this movie. There is classic Ferrel comedy throughout the whole thing.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|We really enjoyed watching Dexter but haven't since cable and satellite media vendors demand that you subscribe to an obscenely expensive movie package just to get access to Showtime. With the voucher I got from Google Offers, it is worth it to get season six from Amazon.  It was insanely easy to view through the Amazon app on my PS3.
B002RKSZS0|4.0|Love this book, Love Jane Austen!  I couldn't put this book down, she is so descriptive and the story line was exciting!
B0083EW97W|3.0|I have always loved Jon Mayer...one of his biggest fans. His albums are always my go to listening music. I had great hopes for this one, but don't get me wrong...it's great. Just not as great as his last two. A bit slower and more melancholy -- not much hints of rock or blues like some of his other material.
B0081FO2Q4|4.0|I have to admit that I was totally unfamilar with Ed Sheeran until a couple of weeks ago.  Amazon recommended it based on my purchase/browsing history.  I listened to the clips and decided to download it and give it a try.<br /><br />I would say that there are not really any songs that I regularly skip.  My favorites right now, though, are \\"The A Team\\", \\"UNI\\", and my favorite is \\"Lego House\\".<br /><br />I love the acoustic guitar and Ed has a very nice voice.  The hip-hop edge of some of the songs gives it a fresh sound.  I'm interested in seeing how Ed develops his talent.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I'm still learning the finer points and controls, but so far this is a great little Android App - The books come thru as easy to read, a simple swipe turns the page. Even the finer print is clear and legible.
B0060SQG9A|5.0|If you loved Wonderwall, Live Forever, Stop Crying Your Heart and Little by Little, this is the CD for you. This is Oasis type music at it's moody best. The whole of the CD is better than its individual songs. The CD felt like a rock symphony. From the first refrain the music soars and floats all the way to the end. Highly recommend!
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie! I really enjoyed the bonus features, hearing about the making of the movie from the director and the actors, it was really interesting. I can't wait until Catching Fire!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really liked this book.  It was one of those books that you couldn't wait to read what happens next.  It was a real page turner until the last page, when I felt there needed to be another page!  I felt like they left the last chapter out.  Hopefully that means that a follow up book is in the works.
B0086QS7N2|4.0|It's so fun to have watched the evolution of this band for twenty plus years.  This album continues the trend of harder, edgy, power rock songs. This album is a great combination of power rocking songs that would not be considered radio friendly, some songs that are a little catchy and could be radio material, and other songs exploring a softer, contemplative side of the genre.  It is a concept album, having a single story joining all of the songs. It was fun to watch the band do something like this that hasn't been seen since 2112. Headlong flight has quickly become one of my favorite all time Rush songs.  I love the interplay and synchronization between Neil and Geddy in this song...it is something so few bands aattempt and ever fewer do well. Being a bass player myself, this song proves to be one of the more difficult ones in Geddy's porfolio to learn and play.  The only negatives I can say are:<br /><br />1. I'm not crazy about the production...it is very raw and has a lot of white noise. I'm normally not a fan of compressing a production, but for rush, a production more along the lines of Counterparts would still allow the \\"rocking\\" side of the album come through, but preserve a fans ability to hear the intricate musicianship and parts that Rush is both individually and collectively know for.<br /><br />2. As much as I love Headlong Flight, I don't care for the \\"speaking\\" part in the song.  In my opinion, it drags the song out and adds a completely unnecessary part that dilutes the sheer rock power of the song.  Without this part, I think this song has the potential to be remembered as one of the greatest progressive rock songs ever.  I think this part adds a \\"love it or hate it\\" moment to the song that will dimish the songs overall greatness.<br /><br />3. Hate the high vocal dubs in Wish Them Well.<br /><br />4. Along the production lines, there's a lot of ambient effects added at the begining and end of songs. I could have done away with less of this.<br /><br />With all this said, the Album is a great addition to the Rush discography.  Well worth a buy for any Rush fan.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Although over 500 pages, the book was so facinating the pages just flew by. I highly recommend it whether you are a computer junkie or not.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|If you like to check how your stocks are doing using your Kindle, this is a great app.  It is easy to set up and has many features for your selection.
B008602KQI|5.0|This was close to following the book. The acting was very good. Worth watching. I did prefer reading the books.  Which I read in order and they were amazing.
B0058DRUV6|4.0|Overall enjoyed the book.  It was well written and well structured.  The book title says it all, basically the book discusses the differences between large decent companies to great large companies.  Decent read but not what I need at my stage in my career.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I decided to order this to find out for myself why it is on the best seller lists. Oh my...I can't remember reading anything so bad for a long time. Its essentially a series of sexual encounters between a virgin (spare me!) and a man with problems (apparently not explained until the next two books) which is strung together with a very weak plot. I nearly gave up half way through. I definitely got the feeling the author wrote a very long novel which was cut into three with no discernible editing.The first novel ends with the plot left dangling...I actually asked someone to tell me what happens as I couldn't bear to read the next two books!<br /><br />I'm not even sure its worth the $9.95 to find out what the fuss is about!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Excellent books couldn't put them down. Finally finished then & bought 5th book.  I am a total fan of Mr. Martin & will read his other works.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app works well. Its easy to use and easy to read. It does simple equations...nothing fancy, but a good simple calculator.
B008602KQI|3.0|Loved the books, but the movie was disappointing.  Didn't follow the book on some key issues.  If you hadn't read the books you would not have understood half the movie.  When they make movies from books they need to be truer to the written word.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Slow start but very good book - don't have to work at reading the book - it just flows  typical Connelly style and story
B0072GPQNG|1.0|This film had a \\"plot\\" that was neither engaging or believable. It had a lot of noise and sporadic maelstrom of \\"action\\" but all without meaning or coherence. I kept asking myself, \\"So what is the point?\\" and \\"Where is this going?\\" and \\"Who cares?\\" The scenery was, like the background music, sometimes really lovely and the only thing enjoyable about the film. I felt sorry for the actors, trying to bring out of the screenplay what had never been put in. I bought this film because it was directed by Spielberg, but the low price should've tipped me off that it wasn't one of his best. It wasn't. If you like horse stories, save your money for a great film like \\"Seabiscuit\\" with Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper, or--even better--buy and read the book of that name by Laurel Hillenbrand.
B008BM9L72|2.0|After hearing so much about this book I was really enthused about finally getting to read it...however much to my dismay this book was one of the most boring books I have ever read. Aside from the sex talk there is nothing worth talking about. Two thumbs down!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I have had no problems with this app, it works perfectly and I love the word of the day feature.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|My only complaint about this story, is learning all the principle players. It would probably be easier to read in paperback, so you could easily flip to the back to look at the family stories. This is fiction that needs a playbook. If you are an avid reader, and love a big story, this is for you. I will be reading the entire series.
B008602KQI|5.0|Awesome movie!!  Can't wait for the next two. It had great action and if you read the books it stayed pretty true to the book, except for a few moments kept out  =)
B008602KQI|5.0|I only started reading the books when I heard the movie was coming out, and started noticing how many people were reading the books out in public. I only started reading the book when the movie debuted in the theaters. I found the movie captured the feeling of the first book even if it wasn't a verbatim adaptation. The glamour and glitz of the Capitol stands in stark contrast to District Twelve which looks like a colourized version of the WPA pictures from the 1930s of the coal mining towns of West Virginia. So when the people from the Capitol, including Effie Trinket(played by a heavily made-up Elizabeth Banks), arrive to take their annual tithe of innocent blood it looks all the more jarring, especially since the first sound hear in District Twelve is the scream of Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields)awakening from a nightmare about to be made true.<br /><br />I would recommend one read the book first, there are scenes the uninitiated will not be able to understand or fully appreciate otherwise, specifically the blue-toned scenes of Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) feeding burnt bread to the pigs and then throwing a loaf toward Katniss (played by Jennifer Lawrence), and the reasons for why she felt the need to address her mother as she does just prior to her departure. However, if you don't feel a pang of sadness when Rue is killed (and I place this in the same realm as when Dobby dies in 'The Deathly Hallows'), then you have failed to understand the point of the book and the movie.<br /><br />The scenes of teenagers killing each other in 'a pageant of honour, courage and sacrifice' are jarring, and a little hard to follow, and the 'shaky-cam' isn't as bad as critics complained, and the hallucinogenic scenes after Katniss succumbs to the tracker jacker stings are um ... trippy, and effective. In the end we are left with a movie which points up hard questions: how do we hang onto to our humanity in the face of barbarism? What are we willing to do survive, and how important are our friends and family to us?
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Rented as a \\"chic flick\\" and it was but also a decent, if not a little odd, story. Not sure I would have been happy to spend theater ticket money on this but as a DVD rental it was ok. And it is a chic flick and could even be a date movie, maybe.
B007X16GFC|5.0|Great story & action in this movie! The 1080p/24fps video & 5.1 dolby digital audio when downloaded to my TiVo Premiere made this movie spectacular!
B008K3HRF0|5.0|Being a fan of the book for decades, I wasn't sure they could pull it off. I'm glad they proved me wrong. The music is fun, the characters priceless and you get closure on it all.
B0060CXAHC|5.0|I bought this movie for my kids. They love it!! I found myself watching it again and it's still fun to watch after all of these years!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I loved the books and had fantasies about how this movie would turn out...so, of course, I set myself up for failure. I read the books over before seeing the movie and was shocked by how much they changed it! I was outraged, but by the time it came out on video, I had time to forget and realized it was a decent adaptation. The visuals are what really earned the stars here and the actors too.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|After 50 yrs of marriage I now understand why some periods of the last 50 yrs seemed like we weren't communicating on the same wave-length but we have come through the tough years and learned that it was worth 'hanging in' for the long haul. With a grandson getting married soon I believe this is a good book for them to read.
B008A1NSTG|5.0|We watched Big Miracle with our 2 granddaughters ages 9 & 7 ..they liked it as much as we did!!<br />We are all big fans of animal movies!!!!
B007LE2VDM|5.0|Can't imagine how I missed Christina Perri until now.  Beautiful lyrics and melodies and arrangements.  Haunting.  Wish there was more coming.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|I have greatly enjoyed reading this series of books. I picked up The Alchemyst on a whim while at the bookstore, and haven't been able to put these books down since! I just finished The Sorceress and can't wait to start the next one. Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys children's/young adult fantasy. These books aren't a hard read, and have plenty of action to keep readers of all ages engaged.
B007SGM084|1.0|I am still forcing myself to continue reading this book. I am by no means a prude,but this book is sex of a different nature. Pretty much all sex. I read and became bored with the same thing in different ways over and over again. How this book was number one on The Best Sellers List is beyond me.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|Reminds me of my childhood. The mischevious boy tries to out wit his aunt and andvetures the countryside. It is a solid read, make sure you don't miss out.
B007MDB548|5.0|I saw this movie with my new children on September 2012 at El Capitan in Los Angeles (a special showing).  My three year-old daughter and my five year-old son sat there mesmerized for the duration of the whole movie.  This movie has a beautiful story-line and wonderful execution.  If Disney had touched up the scenery (\\"background\\") a little more, it could have easily been ready for theaters.  Even as is, the winter scenery is well done.  I actually think this movie might be my favorite of the four tinkerbell movies (and I have watched each of them several times with my kids).<br />The story includes a beautiful moment of personal sacrifice by Tinkerbell.  She \\"gives up\\" something she values greatly to save those she loves (I cannot reveal details without spoiler alert).  What a wonderful lesson for young ones!  I would recommend this highly to any parent with a young son or daughter.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved this story.. Cant wait for his point of view to come out! Fell in love with their love story <3
B001TP698C|4.0|I am writing this review without the actual cd in my hand so here goes. I've been a fan of YES since the seventies and have a number of live cd's of theirs going back to Yesshows, a three album feast of music (now on two cd's). I also love the cd Magnification which featured an orchestra in all the songs. So does YES work live with a full orchestra behind them? Yes and no. The song line up on this cd is fantastic. They do a number of their epic songs like Ritual and The Gates of Delirium. The songs that worked best with orchestration were the songs from the cd Magnification (three in number). For me the other songs were dragging a bit, due to the change in the music arrangements. Compare this with In the Present, their latest live cd. In the Present sounds so much better and the band once again recaptures the magic of these great YES songs. I'm sure in concert Symphonic YES worked and sounded better then what a cd can capture, but as a cd, well, I'll choose Rick Wakeman over an orchestra anyday.<br /><br />The cd starts off with Close To the Edge, and it was there that I noticed some changes I did not like. The orchestration on this song did not work for me. But YES is always trying to keep their sound new and innovative. No, this is not a horrible album - Jon Anderson on vocals is awesome and the band was incredible. But I prefer YES songs to be done by the guys who do them best. If you want to hear a clean and energetic live YES concert get In the Present (Jon does not vocal on this one though). I would have preferred a live rendition of Magnification over orchestrating old material. I give this four stars only because I felt the orchestration, instead of inhancing the music, in most cases slowed it down. But, that's all a matter of taste.
B008602KQI|5.0|Finally a woman portrayed as strong as we've always known them to be. Refreshing and a joy to watch. A movie everyone should see.
B008QZ1ZYQ|2.0|I loved the first one....not this version. they tried to add too many gimmicks and now it freezes up and you cant restart. one feature I liked before that is gone is you can no longer refresh in the middle of a game from main screen. now you have to play thru till you win or lose so you cant try different strategies without wasting time. waited a year for this so I hope they improve it. don't need silly achievements. stop copying angry birds. keep it lean and mean. it was great before.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I liked that it stuck very close to the book.  Only a few minor differences but of no real significance.  I thought it was well done.
B00122N0MU|5.0|You can listen to this compilation 25 times in a row and still be amazed how good this band is.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|You know the first time I watched this was at the theater. And truthfully I did not like it as much as I did this time. Could be the sticky floors the family in front with the fussy child or a miriad of other things.<br />This movie is hilarious. The minions add an extra diminsion and made me laugh. And the inventor guy that does not hear so well and some of the things he makes. It is a great movie and my hubby who is not crazy about cartoons like I am even enjoyed it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is an excellent family movie if you have teens at home.  Grab a bag of popcorn and soft drink and enjoy.  We bought this in HD and love it. Dee
B008XG1X18|4.0|I like pinterest...but have yet to figure out how the ap works on my kindle. May take a bit of time as I have had my Kindle fire awhile and am just figuring out all it can do. Appreciate the free aps. Thankyou
B0088WFZQG|3.0|Lost of action little on story line. Got a little boring towards the end. Could have been done much better if a s tory was behind the action taken.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The 2nd half of \\"A feast for Crows\\" in which he updates the events of the characters not covered in in \\"A Feast for Crows\\". Smooth transition between books with what feels like setting up events for major events in  upcoming releases. Maintains intrigue throughout.
B007SGM084|5.0|I read these books to realize how strong love can be between two people. Real or not, it should be possible.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I loved this novel.  The author had a very interesting way of presenting what can happen to the development of a child left in the system too long.  It also extols the inherent value of the good of human nature.  I would look forward to future novels from this author.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I read the sample, it was pretty long, since I'm going to get this book, and I was drawn into this story, just like I was drawn into LOTR. I think Martin has a real way with words. So go ahead and jump into this book; I don't think you'll be able to get out of it.
B008602KQI|5.0|Out standing cast. Movie was awesome all people should go to see it as it's full of suspence and surprises at every turn.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I am an old person in a young persons mind. I love reading all these Vampires and how they get to be vamps and how they learn to love and have great friends.
B008JAFXOQ|5.0|Margaret is one of the two most brilliant films I have ever seen. I was riveted from the opening scene. It is achingly human and the relationships between the characters are fascinating. It is merciless but never unkind, brutally honest, and just when you think it can't reach any deeper it continues to uncover layers of human experience that hit the bone. All of the acting is breathtaking. Jeannie Berlin is astonishing, as are the incomparable J. Smith Cameron whose nuanced portrayal as the mother is pitch perfect and Anna Paquin, unforgettable and heart-wrenching as Lisa Cohen. Allison Janney's 10 minutes on screen were so powerful and agonizing to watch,  I had to watch it several times because it was so wrenching and I was just floored. She deserves an Academy Award--you know what? They all do. Kenneth Lonergan, said to be cranky, is a genius and I hope he is able to derive pleasure from his magnificent creation.<br />Thank you to everyone involved in making sure that this film has finally seen the light of day. It had been on my Netflix queue since 2006 when I first read about it--!!! Everyone who has a brain should see it. A heart is also helpful.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was creative, and well written, but the ending was horrible. Just when I thought I had figured something out, she threw another loop in there. I almost felt like she ran out of time to get it to the editor, and had to finish it up. I am reading another book by this author because I love her writing, but I really hope it has a better ending!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A lot of strange twists in the 3rd book - made me forget all about book 2!  So sorry it had to end - I want more!!!
B0081L37Z0|5.0|Loved it! Channing Tatum and Jonah were too funny together! Also loved the cameos from the characters from the show!
B003HV0TN2|5.0|I heard about this book through a friend whom i knew to have good taste. I wasn't disappointed with the read. I have spent a lot of time of late reading many books of the fantasy genre but this was as original as I have found in quite a while. The subject of faeries, magic & demons was made to feel real without seeming over the top. Looking forward to the rest of the series.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Loved the first Hunger Games - This was good but a bit tiring compared to the first - Still captivated my interest and read it in two days!
B008602KQI|5.0|I love this show, it is great. It follows the book well. I am excited for the other books of the series to come out too.
B005K17RU0|5.0|the widget isn't as easy to follow. but the app is great. very informative. best one I have tried. (weather bug and weather channel)
B005BOHYW2|5.0|This is such a clever heart pulling story with many shades of light and dark. Poignant and revealing characters craving love but so many hidden secrets of the past make this difficult. Their lives are woven into a beautiful story of redemption.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great book  hard to put down  keeps your interest page after page  have purchased another of her books since finishing this one
B008ASLK8A|3.0|The first one was decent, I expected this to be the same and it was decent as well, but could have been 15 minutes shorter.
B00846REIS|4.0|This was a ver easy read! Couldnt put it down! I was able to get into the book from the very beginning. I cant wait for the next book to come out!
0525478817|5.0|So you read that it's about a girl with cancer and you figure, I've got enough hardship in my own life. What do I need with this noise? But here's the magic of John Green's book. Yes, it has sadness in it but it celebrates life in an amazing and uncompromising way. It's intelligent and beautiful. I've read how others read it and alternately laugh and cry and I must admit I did that too on numerous occasions. But the crying is not because it's some depressingly weepy Oprah book club wannabe. You fall in love with the characters in this novel -- even the scumbag Dutch-American author. It reiterates that life is ultimately finite but it will make you want to live it to the fullest. Read this book.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am really enjoying this book. It's hard to put down and all I can think about is when can I read more of it.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|Story is good but language is difficult.  You would have to be an old time pirate to read with ease
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this app, it works great and is easy to use. You van check your area and look ahead at places you may be traveling to
B0064SHI9I|1.0|The version of My Backup Pro has been updated 10 times according to the release notes on the developers website while the version here on Amazon has not been updated since it was released.  The Play Store version is at 3.2.3 released August 11th while the version here has not been updated since November.  Has this app been abandoned on the Amazon store with not more updates?  If I would have known the app would be abandoned here I would not have purchased it from the Amazon app store and instead gotten it from Google Play store.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Got the item quickly, easy to use digital download....  Freaking love Hunger Games.  Win Win Win<br /><br />Amazon shipped fast and had an time opening the product.
B008JH5CVS|3.0|Lockout is exactly what it looks like: a fun action flick that doesn't require much thought. The action sequences and special effects are competent, but since you're not really expecting much, that's enough. There are several funny lines here - more than I was expecting. Altogether, a well done B-movie. Recommended.
B0083GPDBO|4.0|Wow!  This film is good.  It has a hand-held and realistic appearance.  The characters are very interesting.  You will watch in wonder at times because the special effects are well done. The flying sequences feel like a surreal roller coaster ride.  It is awesome!  However, for most of the film you will also feel uptight because you really feel sorry for the lead character.  It is quite frankly gut wrenching and leaves you with a feeling of emptiness.  This however provokes a great deal of conversation after the credits roll about the fallacies and yet likability of the characters.  It is a much more realistic approach to the following question: What would you do if you suddenly starting developing incredible abilities?
B008LY5VHE|5.0|Great movie, great film. Having the ability to view this film from anywhere that I can access to my Amazon collection is tops! Just allow me to watch my Amazon collection from my Nexus 7 and it'll be perfect!
B002COTI64|5.0|I love Regina Spektor, and her music just keeps getting better and better. Her songs always tell a story - sometimes they make me laugh, and sometimes I am crying by the end of a song. \\"Genius Next Door\\" is particularly moving. Listen to it and be transformed!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl is an absolute must-read for anyone who enjoys complex and well-developed characters, sophisticated story lines, and honest and gritty writing.
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|I served with the 1/9th Cav from 67-69 as a doorgunner and then a crewchief.  I enjoyed this book more than any other that I have read. Mr Mason brought back some fond memories and some that weren't so fond.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent, gripping and beautifully written - and I am not even a fan of sci-fi/fantasy. Well developed characters and a surprisingly structured storytelling make for a real page-turner. It may be sci-fi on the surface, but underneath you will find a study on human nature.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book actually the three books in spanish and english too  because is a love  story but you can laugh many times reading this books
B002DD67XG|5.0|Really like every track. Great songs, great singer.  The only person who doesn't't like this is Carly Simon.  You should buy it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book actually the three books in spanish and english too  because is a love  story but you can laugh many times reading this books
B008602KQI|5.0|Very close to the book.  But seeing children that brutal is very frightening.  Very good acting, because you love some characters and others you hate.
B00633W614|5.0|Sins of the Father was a fast and fun read. A true page turner. I can hardly wait for the next Jeffrey Archer book in the Clifton Chronicles.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I liked the first book, the second one was better, but could have done without book three. This rambled on and on. There was very little substance to this one. To be honest I started skimming just to find out how it ended.
B0057URWSQ|5.0|The song is awesome and I'm glad I finally bought it! It makes my day every time I hear it.
B0019IB0II|4.0|A friend recommended this book to me after I had a small stroke at 52.  Her mother had read it after her stroke and highly rcommended it. I am so glad that I read it.  I did not have lingering physical handicaps after my episode, but felt completely exhausted just a few hours after getting out of bed in the morning. None of my doctors warned me of this symptom.  Once I read about Dr. Taylor's experience, not only did I confirm my sense of how lucky I was to get off so lightly, I learned that fatigue was normal, and what contributed to it, and how to deal with it.  Her \\"insight\\" was invaluable to me.  I think every doctor that deals with stroke patients should read this book and tell their patient's about it.  Anyone dealing with a family member or friend that has suffered a stroke would get a lot out of this book.  She does a great job of explaining what happened to her in a easy to follow way. Even if you don't have a stroke \\"connection\\" her experience is really unbelievable and interesting.  Even the big \\"insight\\" part of her journey where she relates how the different sides of the brain process information and how she learned to live differrently as a result was interesting.  I am not into spiritual lessons and tend to shy away from books that are of that vein, but I did not find this heavy handed or preachy.  It was a great read and a fascinating tale.
B008602KQI|4.0|Show had a lot of what the book had. Portrayed events in an accurate way. Enjoyed sitting down and watching with my wife.
B007AL48UK|4.0|Fun game but needs more options to play. Some different layouts for the game would be great instead of just five or six.
B00355L2TU|5.0|This is BY FAR my favorite DVD of hers. Jillian Michael's strung together a GREAT 20 minute workout. If you're just getting off the couch, level 1 is for you, once you're a bit more advanced, you can do level 2 and then 3.... Should you decide that 20 minutes isn't enough, you can do all of the levels together, and you won't be repeating many moves... except a few cardio moves.... It's NOT all cardio either, there is strength building in this. I haven't been doing this long, and I have to say I already see a remarkable difference in not just my appearance, but my stamina and strength as well. You WILL need hand weights, and a mat if you're working out on a hard service. If I could give it more stars I would.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Matt, if you are nuts enough to write about this and found a nuts enough writer to help you out I only hope you are crazy enough to read this sh*t here, I mean  the reviews. This decision is between you, the team and God, the book is great and gripping.<br /><br />Those who never been or pathetic has beens or currently active non-combat non-essential types will keep turning green from ignorance and envy judging you to which I say - pay no attention, as I am sure you don't.<br /><br />This book reveals nothing new or classified that hasn't been published yet about either DEVGRU or the Neptune Spear. Had it revealed an MBTR freq or SATCOM key, would be another story, but they don't make SEALs stupid, crazy, by all means, but not stupid. Unlike some reviewers who claim they get it, I do not see where it says in the book that you speak for the SO community in general or where you impose your opinions on anyone. Just watch your six. Be safe.
B00846REIS|4.0|Book is similar to \\"Grey\\", but not as good.  I don't like the use of some of the vulgar words, its not necesary for the story.  I'll read the sequel though.
B008602KQI|5.0|The choreography was tremendously surreal.  I am sure the book took longer span of time, but for viewer attention span this suffices.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put this book down.  The storyline was well crafted and the characters were well developed.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading the whole series.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Great app. This app had everything a complete tourist would want in an app. Suggestions of tours/walks around NYC. Great maps you can see the city, distances and nearby public transportation. App helped us find restaurants near our hotel and near the places we visited. Also gives you ratings of the hotels, restaurants and places to visit. Besides the ratings are other people recommendations/ suggestions. The app also gives you vital information for visiting places such as links to purchase tickets online and ahead of time (Or for the Twin Towers memorial, you have to sign up online early).  Also, my Kindle Fire gets wi fi from the hotel we stayed in but once out on the street, the app contains alot of information within so that you don't neccessarily need internet to get information.
B003R1B9MW|5.0|Great Movie!  This is one of the best golf movies out there.  It does a great job of capturing the time period.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like this app because of the simplicity of it. instead of having to go all the way to the settings bar to see how much battery I have left, all I have to do is go to the notifacations bar. it also gives an estimate on how much time you have left for your device before the battery runs out. this is a must have app! :)
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The movie was worth a watch...a bit over hyped in my opinion. It was ok, but nothing to write home about.
B00846REIS|4.0|This novel is very similar to 50 Shades but that is why I loved it. Never a dull moment. I can't wait for book two.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I always purchased my books, and now order books for my Kindle from Amazon. As I was finishing the Hunger Games trilogy, I was panicking as I didn't know another really great trilogy I could read that would be as good and keep my interest.  Until I decided to read The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo.  Well, all I can say is that this entire series has kept me in total suspense. Just when I thought I can trust a certain character, and there are many, you find out they are evil.  Again, I don't know what I am going to read once I finish this last book in the trilogy.  I know that I have many more tense, suspensful twists and turns ahead before I complete this last book which will be in the next day or so. However, I would totally recommend this book to anyone. I would have to say that it would not be suitable for children under 17-18. But otherwise I totally recommend that people who like suspense with a sprinkle of dirty local law and government employees you won't be disappointed reading this trilogy. I really hate for it to end.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|From the first to the third, I was engaged the entire time.  All my colleagues (5 of us) read it together. We all loved the book and couldn't put it down. : )
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Adobe Reader works fine, just like on the computer.  I haven't used it much so I can't compare to the more advanced features that are on the PC version.  It would be nice if a PDF document could scale to your device's screen to be readable, like an e-book.  But, I understand the limitations of PDF files to be able to do that, just wishful thinking on my part.
B008602KQI|5.0|It's been a long time since I've seen a movie as faithfully adapted to the screen as The Hunger Games!  If you loved the book, you will love the DVD, and if you haven't yet read the book, this will make you want to click over to the \\"Books\\" section and buy it, too!
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie is as good as it was presented when it first came out in the theaters and certainly kept me on the edge of my seat during some scenes.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I usually steer clear of Stephan King's book.  A little too bizarre for me.  But after reading a few reviews, I decided to read 11/22/63; and I'm glad that I did.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the way that Mr. King wove together his characters.  Once I got started, it was too hard to put down.  I found myself turing pages in order to see what will happen next.  I highly recommend this book.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This is sort of funny. I got it a while ago and thaought it was going to be a big deal.<br />So I tried it to tell you about it and it is soooo easy.<br />A
B006LSZECO|4.0|It keeps you guessing. One minute you hate one character and the next you do a 360. A great read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is as sexy as it gets! Can't wait to read the next ones! Got to get some more Christian Grey!
B008UO7WB8|5.0|Good video quality. Love this show. Would definitely recommend Episodes on amazon instant video. A a a a a a
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is a great book for baby boomers who lived it. King's reoollection of the past made me realize how much the world has changed since I was a kid. It made me see that I am not an aging liberal who has become more conservative with age but someone who has stayed reletively the same while the world, including America, has re-invented itself. Great book for fans of time travel too with just the right amount of the King wierdness.
B00136Q1I0|5.0|Bruce Springsteen has done so much more than this but it's a great album of some earlier stuff.  It just brings back memories and smiles of a more \\"Charged\\" time in my life.  I've still got the vinyl album.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|This App is great. I kept an eye on my pets when I was away.<br /><br />My little dog got stuck and I wouldn't have known to send help.<br /><br />Works on all my devices.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|love the graphics very hard  to put down. something the kids can play and not have to worry.  really enjoyable;)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season two is wonderful and ends spectacularly!  There is a lot of character development, which keeps things very interesting.  Can't wait for season three to air!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app takes advantage of the kindle fire screen it is very quick,  shows what you last typed in, and even has a handy backspace key totally worth getting!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this book! When it ended I had to buy the next one immediately because I was in tears.... it appears fifty himself got to me. Completely worth reading!
B008POAQS4|4.0|Interesting, somewhat dramatic and occasionally witty. Season two has a great plot line as Harvey fights a lawsuit that could end his career if he doesn't win. There are some twists with Donna at the firm. Mike struggles with a blowing loss not related to any cases. All in all a good season.
B007VUA7VO|2.0|this app drained the battery faster than any other app. would not recommend. only reason for 2 star is temp gage was nice.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|got the Bible from Amazon and read from it every day . it's easy to read and has every version you can think of.it will even read itself to you if you want it to.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this is the best book in he whole entire world i love the movie to but the book is the origanle i couldnt put it down i finished it in 6 hours
B008JAGZDE|5.0|Loved it , it was good seeing the gang back together.just funny not much more to add , cant sum it up in 20 words , just buy it
B008BM9L72|5.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy! After all the hype behind the books, I was interested but not expecting anything amazing. What a surprise. I loved it. Highly recommend reading this trilogy, you cant put it down once you start!
B0042UEU8M|4.0|Good movie. It is what you would expect from a similar Nicholas Sparks style movie. The plot is good though, the story behind it is good and the actors were perfect for their roles!
B008602KQI|4.0|My teen girls just love this movie.  We have read all the books.  A word of caution, even with the PG-13, it is violent at times.  We use it as a teaching tool to explain the difference between reality and fiction, as well as to talk about why the rich live in the capitol and the poor live in the other places.  We talked about group-think, and why people would follow along with the rules that were imposed on them.
B003ZFCBJ0|4.0|The story was good. Typical for a Nicholas Sparks film. I am not a big fan of Miley Cyrus so that would be the only thing negative for me but her acting was not THAT bad. Hemsworth was awesome and HOT!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. It is challenging & fun-- exactly what one should expect in a game. My only problem is in regards to the pop-up advertising that occurs every time  I request a new deal of the cards! It is annoying and I must delete it before the cards will deal out! Sometimes the x box is so buried in the corner that it is difficult to activate! This is the same on all the game apps on my Kindle Fire.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a pretty good book. A few twist and turns makes this a very good read. I will say that following the same roadmap as the first was kind of boring but it is made up here and there
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Enjoyed reading all four of the books. However after reading Dance with Dragons, I was left with so many unanswered questions. Please tell me there will be a #6 in the series or I have wasted my time reading books with no ending,
B003O86FMW|5.0|This second book followed in the footsteps of the first in terms of action, love, and overall theme. The storyline is captivating, as well as addictive.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|Team Edward!!! I absolutely love this movie!!! Especially when Jacob imprinted...then the Vampire/Werewolf fight...All in All two thumbs up! :-)
B0083GR6Y6|1.0|This film is ridiculous from multiple POV. Dont even bother.<br /><br />I didnt realize it was going to be an outdoor adventure movie, created by a bunch of Californians that probably never stepped foot out of a sound stage. This film is one of the worst I have ever watched.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The first time I saw this movie , I fell in love with the characters ! It is a hilarious display of Good and evil at . Everyone should watch this film atleast once a week to keep you laughing !
B008ASLNN2|4.0|if you liked the first Guy Ritchie Sherlock, you will like this one too. This film is clever, and funny. I enjoyed watching the actors. But mostly, it was the brilliant film work of Guy Ritchie that does not disappoint. Its classic Ritchie grit and grain. Who did the sets and costumes? Award for that person. Great fun film, only slightly challenging to keep up with the mysterious plot, as Sherlock Holmes story should be.
B008XFAT7S|3.0|After watching \\"The Raid Redemption\\" and comparing it with movies such as, Kung Fu Hustle -for the martial arts- and the goriness of I Saw the Devil and The Chaser, I have to say I was not all satisfied with this movie. The plot is very simple, predictable and somehow weak, the action is OK and I am all for Korean or Chinese movies with real martial arts and goriness. Sorry but this movie is not what I expected base on the Amazon's reviews.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|yea its super cool like legit it helps me with my math and stuff like yea so like yea print Yggdrasil
B008XG1X18|4.0|here is yet another example of why I cant function without the Internet nor can I remember how we lived without it for so long...
B008602KQI|5.0|What a wonderful way to take the journey from pen to page, page to book, book to script, and script to screen.  Masterfully done!
B003SI1W3K|4.0|Great movie. Fun and funny. Well written with great animation. Interesting twist on an old theme. A must see for kids.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can't put this book down! It's so addictive....I find myself rereading a page or two just to cum my underline Goddess.
B000UZNSWM|5.0|A wonderful read that ignores the rays of heavenly light and choirs of angels music that usually accompanies a review of Douglas MacArthur's exploits. He is accurately described at the egomaniac he was. The lives of the thousands he shed in WWII and Korea can finally salute the truth. The only thing missing is the description of the evacuation of his furniture from the Philippines while General Wainwright was left behind.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a fabulous read.  The book was a terrific page turner from start to finish.  It comes highly recommended.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Excellent Album.  I can listen to it from start to finish over and over again unlike many albums where only the hits are even worth listening to.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love love love it. finally on android. easy to use. it is addicting just like the original. I love pinterest
B0015DWLD0|4.0|I read this novel as a little prep for my upcoming India trip. A first person narrative from one technologically emerging country, India, to another, China, written with both humor and poignancy. In learning about India's caste system, the reader gets a real perspective on Black India and White India giving a new meaning of servitude...as well as perseverance.
B008602KQI|3.0|I read all the books, my husband didn't. I enjoyed the movie, my husband didn't. I had to keep pausing to explain things to him that weren't explained very well in the movie. The book really is much better.
B00846REIS|5.0|Excellent book - have already \\"clicked to buy\\" her next book.  Great love scenes.  Just missing Christian's Neiman Marcus Personal Shopper from Grey books !!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The 2nd book is the best in the series by far. I felt like the 3rd one was just dragging the story on and wasn't developed very well.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|The movie was very well done for a number of reasons.  First and foremost, it followed the book!  I know this may sound silly but not many of these movies based on books don't actually follow the book.  The movie really is bone-chilling.  The thought of what a world like this would be like is truly terrifying.  I really got emotionally attached to the main characters as well as some of the minor (I wish Rue had not more screen time, I loved her in the book!)  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone but I would highly recommend you read the book first, it is a pretty quick read and a real page turner!
B007KOMTUI|5.0|After \\"discovering\\" the first 4 Seasons of Mad Men on Netflix and being completely captivated I was looking everywhere for Season 5.  Of course,Amazon came through for us and we were easily able to download it to our new internet ready TV.  We carefully made sure that we only watched one episode a night, just to make it last longer.  Season 5 was not a disappointment ... lots of twists and turns and unexpected surprises.  If you are a Mad Men \\"addict\\", get Season 5; you won't be disappointed.  Now, WHEN oh WHEN does Season 6 begin!!
B007C9N4H8|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie, but it was only ok. W watched the whole movie, which is why i gave it 3 stars (we could get though it because it wasn't painful), but i would have rather spent my time watching something else.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book takes you on all the twists and turns of a current headlining murder mystery! Did he? Didn't he? Did he? didn't he? How? When? OMG! It's a roller coaster ride I thoroughly enjoyed!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I will not say that this was the best series i have read. I saw alot of fault in the arc of the story but they were all forgivable due to an engaging narrative, and heart felt descriptions of the main character's feelings. But the ending was what made this series great, it gave it that extra factor that all great stories have. A sense of change and insecurity. A sense that shakes you and makes you doubt any prediction you had about the conclusion of this saga. It was a great read, and i recommend it dearly.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had a hard time putting this series of books (3) down.  As soon as I finished book 1 (in about 2 days) I downloaded the next two books (read for 3 days straight).  This author brings soft porn to the doorstep of the average woman.
B008JH5CVS|4.0|Tbis was a pretty decent movie. A lot of action, but u think it could have ended a motley different. Other than that I was happy watching it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I had a hard time putting this series of books (3) down.  As soon as I finished book 1 (in about 2 days) I downloaded the next two books (read for 3 days straight).  This author brings soft porn to the doorstep of the average woman.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I can honestly say that this book by Robert T. Kiyosaki is the best book about Finance, that I have ever read. It shows you how to deal with money not just with plain information like boring lectures, but it tells real life storys to make it simpler and easier to read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I had a hard time putting this series of books (3) down.  As soon as I finished book 1 (in about 2 days) I downloaded the next two books (read for 3 days straight).  This author brings soft porn to the doorstep of the average woman.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|As just coming off the Shades of Grey trilogy, this book was a nice change of pace. The story line kept me intrigued most of the book. I loved how vibrant the characters and setting were. Four stars!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not put it down! Riveting! Suzanne Collins is an amazing writer. I finished this book in record time ane couldn't wait to get the 2nd installment! A must read!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very informative and easy to read. It has helped me learn a lot more about what may be causing many, if not all, of my digestive \\"issues.\\" I certainly recommend it to anyone wondering why they have so many different health problems that doctors have not been able to find a solution to.<br /><br />Bob Stafford
B0088TG252|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and thought Ryan Reynolds was fantastic.  The plot, although over-the-top in parts, was mostly believable and a lot of non-stop action fun.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book was great.  Interesting and informative as well as entertaining. I would recommend this book to people interested in running, but also to anyone who is interested in different cultures. It was about the Tarahumara Tribe.  Very insightful.
0812550757|5.0|At some level, each one of us is an alien to the other.  We draw on our common experiences and perceptions to understand each other, with varying successes.  Which one of you has never looked blankly at another person (usually someone you have a close relationship with, because otherwise you don't get close enough for this) and wondered who they really were that they actually thought such-and-such made sense?<br /><br />If you took a group of people, and each person had been brought up with no experiences overlapping the rest of the group and there was no common language, how would communication occur?  I would hope for slowly and carefully.  Sometimes there is also a regrettable tendency to view people who do not speak your birth language as mentally slow.  Would you feel superior in every way to the rest of the group?  What would have to occur to change that perspective?  How would you react?<br /><br />In this book, Orson Scott Card addresses these questions, but takes them so much further.  Where [[ASIN:B003G4W49C Ender's Game]] was a story about species survival at any cost, Speaker for the Dead crosses into the realm of moral survival.  How will it change you?<br /><br />Orson Scott Card writes this next book without losing any of the world-building and amazing characterization skills displayed in his other works.  I rate it for 16 and older on the Aardvark scale for adult situations, moral dilemmas, and philosophical questions better discussed with parents or considered by an established worldview.  If you enjoyed Ender's Game, you will be blown away by this sequel.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|not an easy game to play, but kids love it they can spend hours playing the video game addictive and funny
B002RHGYOA|5.0|Mindblowingly good prose, thrilling plot lines and wonderful characterisation.  It was very hard to put this book aside as it is totally encapsulating.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Good movie, but thankfully i read the book first.  I saw the movie with someone who hadnt read the book and they were lost
B006LSZECO|3.0|Good read, a lot of twists and turns - definitely kept me interested. I just would have preferred a different ending.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was so interesting. I Could not put this book down.  There was a twist around every corner.  I plan to read more books by this author
B0055SWM08|5.0|a great puzzle game to play on trips and what not. fun, challenging, and rewarding gameplay. recommended for anyone who likes new, out of the box puzzles.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Oh my gosh, this game is so addictive! I love it and it really makes you have to think. Our whole family loves to play.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Slightly entertaining but the repetitive descriptions of characters' physical attributes and behaviors became very boring.  Could not spend the time to read book three.
B004Q9T4E4|2.0|Doesn't live up to the review hype. gave up at 40%. He's not actually a very good writer. He loses the connection between his ideas before half way through. Guns, Germs and Steel way above this level.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I like this movie. It follows the book quit close when it comes to the action. However it doesn't quite convey all the emotions brought to us through the book.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was bored with it and did not enjoy it the way I hoped to. They built the book up to be something it's not
B007Z9QA8K|1.0|Predictabke until it drops off a cliff at the end leaving nothing resolved. I want my 2 hours back. A a a a a a a a a a a
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is quite the page turner for all ages. I was glad I didn't start reading it until after all three in the series were out as I immediately wanted to continue on the adventure with Katniss. The book is vividly written so every violence portrayed, emotion felt, and problem solved can be imagined and experienced by the reader. Watched the movie after and was sadly disappointed as the book is so much more excellent!
B00006LWSF|5.0|Fantastic rap soundtrack. The four Eminem songs and D12 song are some of the best of his career. The production on the album, most of which is helmed by Eminem, is top level.<br /><br />Highlights include the outstanding \\"Lose Yourself\\" and \\"8 Mile\\".<br /><br />Eminem brought in top level guests Jay-Z, Nas and Rakim who are all great. Macy Grey and Boomkat also provide a couple of great slower ballads.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|I personally don't listen to this music but my 12 yr old absolutely loves Linkin Park. He says this CD is great...He loves all the songs:)
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Philippa Gregory is unbeatable as a historical fiction writer. The current series of books involve one period in English history, with each novel exposing it from a different players viewpoint. Such fun!
0545265355|5.0|My daughter has loved this series since they first came out.  I purchased the Trilogy set for her for Christmas last year.  She reads them over and over again, and now that they have made a movie from this set, she is really excited to see it.  Thanks for awesome products, great prices and fast shipping.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie first and it was great! But this book blows it out the water! The detail in the book is really what makes the difference, everything Katniss thinks in detailed in the book.
B008602KQI|1.0|Which was annoying because I can't stand iTunes. I wanted to share this DVD with friends by allowing them to watch it on their own DVD players and I thought I could because it was supposed to have a digital copy... unfortunately it didn't and my friends were unable to watch it... I'm forced to download it onto my computer! How stupid is that? If I could return it I would. I even believe that you are only allowed to download it once. Ugh. Waste of money.<br /><br />The movie however is entertaining. The books are better, but that's the way it usually is :)
0316023744|1.0|I've never written an Amazon review before, so first, let me say I am a social studies teacher with ten years experice as well majors in history and politcal science, and a passion for reading military history in general and on the second world war specifically.<br /><br />Shy do I say this?  Simple:  Beevor's work violates everything I was ever taught about writing history.<br /><br />First, his writing is anglo-centric to the point of being amero-phobic.  Or, put another way, the title of the book should actually be \\"How the British (and friends) won the Second World War.\\"  Consider:  Despite saying early on that the European and Pacific theaters are equally important, he gives short shrift to the PTO for the entire book.  Consider:  He spends a chapter on Crete - an interesting camapign, to be sure - but devotes a scant page or two to Midway, a far more decisive battle (and even then he quotes the indited narrative of Mitsuo Fuchida verbatim as fact....).  Another example?  He understandably devotes multiple chapters to the Normandy campaign, but barely mentions the nearly simultaniously - and arguably as important to the defeat of Japan - invasion of Saipan, making the bomber offensive against the home islands possible.<br /><br />Even more damning, IMO, is his treatment of D-Day itself.  He devotes several pages to the Anglo-Canadian beaches, but says NOTHING about the American beaches except that they \\"faced lighter opposistion but much worse terrain.\\"  His next sentance then indites the Americans, telling us that we silly Americans ignored Brooke's warnings of the difficulties involved with the bocage (pg. 581).<br /><br />And that's all he says.  No mention of the Ameircan beaches, or Point du Hoc, or the Rangers.  Nope.  We had it easy, and the only reason it was hard at all was becuase we didn't listen to out British betters.<br /><br />Now, I am being sarcastic, but....  I am no anglophobe, and in fact am rather a student of British history.  But to do what Beevor did with his D-Day chapter is a shameful disgrace to the men who fought and died there.<br /><br />Second is his poor research.  There were innumerable times that I would read something Beevor asserted that I'd never heard before in twenty years of reading on the  topic, and I went to check his sources - no cite.  Then I saw \\"Bibliography online.\\"  \\"Ah,\\" I thoght.  \\"Maybe there the source notes are listed!\\"  Nope.  It lists only his sources.  No listing of his foot notes.  I was taught \\"If you quote someone, you need to cite the quote.\\"  Mr. Beevor has apparently never learned this.<br /><br />Worse is the lack of depth to his research.  History students today are taught the primacy of primary sources; again, Mr. Beevor has apparently not been.  The vast majority of his sources are secondary sources written within the last decade or so.  He seems to have rarely, if ever, gone back to the words of the actual particpants, or unit histories, or even secondary sources written shortly after the war by people famiiar with the facts and people involved.  No, he instead indites authors like David Glantz in his text (he specifically does this in book's text) - a writer who has done more primary source research on the Eastern Front than Mr. Beevor ever has.  I own and have read seven of Mr. Glantz's books, and met him at a seminar a deacde ago.  His reserach includes reading Soviet Unit histories - in Russian.  Mr. Beevor can't seem to be bothered to go beyond ten year old tertiary sources as his primary research.<br /><br />Third, and in some ways most damning, is his resorting to undignifed ad hominum attaks - again with no evidence to back them up.  He does this MANY times - and usually directed at an American.  I quote just one example, in reference to the '44 campaign to take Rome. (pg. 571)  \\"Clark's obesseion was so intense that one can assume he had become slightly deranged.... CLark even claimed at one point that he warned Alexander that, if units of the Eighth Army entered Rome before him, he would order his men to open fire on them.\\"<br /><br />Now, I will say I have heard that Clark had made this reference about getting into Rome before the Brits in other places.  But as to Clark being deranged?  One can assume that, sure.  But Beevor writes it as if it were a fact, not his own opinion  But when I went to check his end notes for a source to back this claim up - a psycholigist, the words of someone present at the time, even another historian...  Yep.  You guessed it:  nothing.<br /><br />In short, this book is a frightful example of anglo-centrisim at best, poorly written and reserached junk in fact, and amero-phobia at worst.  Do yourself a favor:  don't even get this book from the library, as I thankfully only did, and surely don't buy it.  Instead, pick up Max Hasting's \\"Inferno\\" (a Brit author who doesn't seem to hate Americans), Murray and Millett's \\"A War to be Won,\\" or, fromt the American persepctive, Rick Atkinson's \\"The liberation Trilogy.\\"

B008602KQI|5.0|Loved it and my kids aged 20, 17, and 14 also loved it!!! Couldn't put the book down.  Read the whole series...loved them all!
B007XNTDPA|4.0|In  The Accused, tween 'lawyer' Theodore Boone returns in another entertaining read from Grisham, targeting young/youth readers. He is accused of a crime and fights to clear his name with the help of one of the town's colourful characters.
B00406MXY6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series.  It has everything you could want in a Merlin/Arthur adventure: love, humor, adventure, and the fight between good vs. evil. I really loved the acting - terrific series.  Looking forward to seeing more!!  Totally loved the magic and funny spells, too.
B003MS0UHU|5.0|This movie was outstanding for the whole family!  It was action packed, hilarious and wArm and caring all at the same time.  I could see it over and over again!!
B001BR3P3U|5.0|Such a classic! Hilarious and soulful, and with an amazing soundtrack. I often refer to it as the blues-man's musical. Probably my favorite movie of all time.
B008SA21N8|5.0|I love SUITS and most if not all of the episodes in this 2nd season were awesome! There's a lot of development with all the characters, great to watch

B000W4SE6G|4.0|wonderful. Nothing like it. No dialogue but I knew that. Interesting Philip Glass music. Some might not care for it but I'd try it
B0071XO8RA|5.0|To Hugh:<br />Loved the book!  Plz keep this series going!<br /><br />To those looking at this as your next read:<br />If you've gotten this far and you're still considering whether to read it, do yourself a favor and jump in!  I took this on vacation and ended up neglecting my family till I wrapped it.  So learn from my mistake and isolate yourself for a day or two in a place where you can pull that off first, then dive in.
B004SH40BQ|4.0|Bought this to try and get the killer combo of Nano on wrist with Bluetooth on head. Ultimately I had to conclude that the Nano's power output just isn't enough to support any Bluetooth solution reliably. I also tried JayBird's equivalent product, and this was better, but still inadequate. I also tried more than one brand of Bluetooth headphones.<br /><br />As the other reviews say, it drains the Nano battery at a frightening rate, and at less than full power you'll have difficulty maintaining the connection unless you're wearing the Nano like a big square earring, which will lead to cut-outs and then dropped connections entirely. Believe it. If you're looking for the Nano Bluetooth solution I'm not sure a great one really exists as of this writing, although there are some interesting Kickstarter projects out there trying to solve the problem.<br /><br />That said, there appears to be nothing wrong with this product. This is what you want to get for some other larger iPod that doesn't have built-in Bluetooth (note that the current Touch models do, and with none of the issues I'm describing here),  Rumors point to a revamped larger Nano for the Q4 2012, and if it doesn't have Bluetooth built in, it may have the power to drive something like this. Of course, rumors also say they're changing the connector too.
B005LF9OCE|5.0|HIMYM is a fantastic show that will touch your heart from the very first episode and not let go till the very end. This season continues with the balance of comedy, real-life drama, and overall good fun that the past 6 seasons have shown us, and I definitely feel that season 7 is worth the 5 stars and I will definitely remember it as one of the best seasons of the show.
B00130UFY2|5.0|The Bourne series is my husbands favorite! We had to do a Bourne marathon before we could go to the theater to watch \\"Bourne Legacy\\".

B008KNUKVI|5.0|I love this band.  I admit that I am biased as I rooted for them all last year on The Sing-Off, but they have definitely grown as a group since then.. I wholeheartedly recommend this EP.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Oops. I mistakenly reviewed The Distant Hours here, not the House at Riverton. But I have read Riverton and enjoyed it every bit as much, perhaps even a little bit more. Both were written by the gifted Kate Morton.<br /><br />Re: The Distant Hours...<br />My husband is reading this book aloud for us. As a former editor, I especially enjoy Morton's unique turns of phrase. She's original and clever with words. One recent favorite phrase has [the character] Juniper running \\"with hope running alongside her.\\" I may have misquoted somewhat, but the gist is there. We find ourselves stopping now and then to savor passages like that.<br /><br />It's a long read, and unfolds ever so slowly, which may drive some to distraction. But we find her style compelling, refreshing and intelligent. Five stars plus from this house!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book even though I just started it I am already very intrigued. The writing is done very well and keeps you constantly turning the pages.
0525953728|3.0|There are two elements that influence my rating of this book- the content and the sharing of the content. I think that most people (myself included) are going to be fascinated by the inside glimpse of what it is like to be in the Teams. However, as a patriot who has had two family members in the Teams, I am deeply disturbed by the telling of this story. I keep stopping and starting because I find it hard to separate the story from the betrayal. The WWII slogan, \\"Loose Lips Sink Ships\\" still holds true today. What goes on in the Teams should stay in the Teams because you don't know what you are giving away and what implications it may have. The book is a fascinating read. It's well written, but is it true? I have no idea (the \\"confirming sources\\" is hardly evidence to back anything up), but I get sick when I think that one person took it upon himself to share it with the world and put so many people at risk. I am not any sort of person who is in-the-know, but I can tell you that there is classified info in the book. They are fairly well known secrets, but they are things that shouldn't be talked about. That is a shame. The whole time I felt like I was rubber necking past an accident. It's like I had to watch, but I really didn't want to know and should have respect enough to turn my head. The 3 stars reflects that I do not think this story should have been told.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie.  I really didn't think I would like the movie, but it was really good.<br />I expected a teen movie or a \\"Tit-Zit\\" flick, but it fooled me.  Excellent.
B003GRWBW4|5.0|Harold and Maude is a fantastic movie, with so many little bits that are easy to miss on the first watch.  Truly a \\"must see\\".
B001HN6922|2.0|I saw Cars several years before I became a parent and thoroughly enjoyed it. Cars is the first full length movie that my 2.5 year old son has had the patience to sit though, and even after a view dozen viewings, I still enjoy watching the movie with him. I had heard that Cars 2 was not very good and was not appropriate for young kids, and although I remained a bit skeptical, I figured that I should watch the movie myself before showing it to my son. Unfortunately, the criticism is right. First and foremost, the movie simply isn't very good. It's an interesting idea to do a spoof of a James Bond style movie, but it didn't work out very well. The plot was pretty weak and felt forced. I think the movie would be even worse if you didn't already have a connection to Lighting and Mater from the original. The bigger issue though, is that this movie is not at all appropriate for young kids. Apart from the fact that it would be difficult for a young kid to follow, I thought the level of violence was totally inappropriate. I have no problem with violent cartoons generally--I grew up on action cartoons and plan to show my son some of the greats, like GI Joe--but even in the \\"violent\\" action cartoons the bad guys don't actually kill the good guys. Not that my son would understand now, but it just seems unnecessary to have to explain to a young child all of the violence and death. I was excited to show my son cars 2 given how much he likes the original, but I definitely won't be showing this one to him for at least a few years. It's unfortunate that they had to ruin such a good franchise.
B008602KQI|4.0|Hunger Games, the movie, is true to the book, for the most part. I read the book first, and was disappointed that more of the story was not included. But, I was very willing to suspend disbelief and was definitely drawn into the film.
B008602KQI|3.0|I read all three books in a week. The movie was ok but nowhere near what it could have been. It may be worth renting and watching once but I regret buying it because I wont watch it again. I will however read the book again.
B008CP93S0|1.0|This movie was a waste of some really great acting talent. Not funny or entertaining at all! I wish I had never purchased!
B005CRQ4XI|2.0|I read this book on my sister's recommendation.  It's not something I would have chosen and I wasn't even sure it was a true story until the end.  I thought some parts of it were not believable.  I've spent time walking distances and found that without training it would be almost impossible to do what she says she did.  Although she did write about the state of her feet I still didn't buy into the story.<br /><br />I will say that I found her honesty about herself in other ways interesting.  Her addiction to heroin, her desparation in grabbing any person to sleep with and her overall lack of good judgement.  I suppose that was ultimately reflected in her decision to walk the trail without any real preparation.<br /><br />I didn't understand the reasoning behind changing her last name when she discussed through the book how she felt distant emotionally from her family.  It seems to me that would be a very good way to disassociate yourself.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this book.
B007UXSKMU|5.0|Excellent movie and excellent cast.  Hope the next Mission Impossible movie has the same team in the movie with the same cast.

B0088O11NU|5.0|I had tried this game on a Nook, but this one on my android tablet is great. This is a very challenging game an takes a lot of skill, and steady hand.
B008EQIK90|2.0|For all the high marks this movie received, I sure do not know why. I must be missing something. In my opinion, there was hardly any humor. Mostly childish pranks not worthy of a laugh.
B008602KQI|4.0|Good movie but there are not really any extras.  Sure you get the making and behind the scenes but there are no deleted scences which is my favorite part.  Good movie though.
B005HSL626|5.0|My 4-y old nephew loved this game. Great to have available when there 'wait' time when you are out an about - out to dinner, sitting in a waiting room, the check out......

B004J4WNL2|4.0|Quiet begins strongly, makes a solid case for introverts as successful people. Last part of book dwindles but overall very well worth a read.
B005IQZB14|5.0|With many trials and tribulations, the author tackles  the Pacific Crest Trail  with her \\"Monster\\" pack, shoes that are too small and a lot of heart.
B008602KQI|5.0|I was really pleased with this movie. It was very entertaining.  Since my daughter just recently began to shoot a bow, it really enlightened her.  Joy is all anyone could want and this movie definitely has it.  I highly recommend this movie.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|An very good read! Historical Fiction that will no doubt be turned into a movie. I couldn't put it down and was sad when I was finished reading it.
B0083GQKQG|4.0|I like movies that go outside the typical Hollywood formula and this movie does just that.  The performances are all top notch.  This movie is a dark and wild ride!
B000SEGEKI|5.0|It's all too easy to fall into a grind of just writing code and churning out software but forgetting about the most important thing - that you LOVE IT!<br />This book reminds you of that and then fills you with practical thoughts and ideas about how to make yourself and your career even better.<br />I have the physical book and I bought a kindle edition so I could have it with me!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|did i spell that right? Suspenseful? Anyhow this book is full of nail biting suspense. Hard to put down, and very addicting. Get it, read it and you will not leave your chair all darn day! Its the next book that's kind of a buzzkill!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is a very \\"rich\\" work.It is set at the time of the Great War.Events take place in Russia,Wales,Germany,the US etc.The characters of this novel are very fully developed-with an extraordinarily detailed knowledge of the various cultures of those times.It kept my interest,through all 852 pages ! It is fascinating how Follett develops the characters in synchronism with the changing times-class issues and issues connected with the changing fortunes of the war.I cannot wait for the remaining members of the trilogy

B005LAII1C|2.0|I like dumb movies but this was very disappointing because they tried to get too serious. Acting was okay, not great. It is like when someone is joking but if falls flat because they make it too personal?? The movie is just Bad. The part where you cry over the death of the teddy? Please... It was far too intense for a FUN and DUMB movie.
B004J64QSI|5.0|The 25th anniversary production of Les Miserables is powerful and moving. It is amazing that all that talent can be put together on one stage. Combining the moving story by Victor Hugo, the incredible music, and the talent of the director and performers results in more than entertainment. It is an experience that you won't want to miss.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|This was an enjoyable read.  I found the historical information interesting at times but also a little long winded at others.  All together it was a good story but not the best.
B000JMKOI2|5.0|This is a new author for me and I was not sure what to expect. I am glad I discovered him and look forward to read all of his books.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent writting! There was drama, romance, sex, life's ups and downs, all wrapped into a life that most women dream of.
B0081L37Z0|3.0|This was a comedic retake on the TV police drama 21 Jump Street that launched the careers of Johnny  Depp and Holly Robinson (Peet).  Those who were fans of the original will find little resemblance to that show beyond some cameo appearances from some of the original stars.  Jonah Hill put in his usual fine comedic performance as the nerd and Channing Tatum did an adequate job as the muscle.  I'm giving this one 3 1/2 stars.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The story plot was good and very well written.  The first book of the Trilogy makes you want to continue to the end of all three books.
B000JPRPAO|4.0|I had to go back to this one for the kids. A very entertaining movie. Mark Wahlberg & Charlize Theron had great chemistry! What a great ensemble! And who doesn't love Donald Sutherland??

B002Y0TGOU|3.0|Good actors, very good action and special effects, excellent video and audio quality of the Amazon HD copy,<br />but a really absurd script. The whole thing doesn't make any sense, but it's fun.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I bought this game out of curiosity and I am glad I did. The concept is simple enough to understand the first time around and challenging enough to keep it interesting as the levels go up.

0061692042|3.0|I'm a sucker for a novel with a unique setting and that's the case in Richard Ford's CANADA. I had second generation relatives who moved to Saskatchewan when most of the homesteading claims were filled, and I wanted to see if it was more than wheat fields and open prairie.<br /><br />Ford is one of our better novelists. He even made the New York Times best seller list for a few weeks, not easy to do for a literary writer these days. This novel seems to ask the question, \\"How do you act when life pulls the rug out from under you?\\"<br /><br />Twins Dell and Berner Parsons are only fifteen when their parents decide to rob a bank and get caught. Dell the narrator's father Bev is an air force captain and former bombardier during World War II. But he can't adjust to civilian life. He's implicated in a beef steeling ring and pretty much asked to leave the service. In partnership with some Indians and a crooked railroad porter, he tries the same thing on the outside and is double-crossed. The Indians think they're owed money and Bev needs to do something fast. He's pretty much just a big kid; a very recognizable big kid, considering he's good-looking and he's wearing his flight suit stripped of its captain's bars when he robs the bank. His wife, Neeva, a Jewish woman, seems to have more good sense than to participate in such a half-baked scheme, but she later realizes she's a lot weaker person than she ever imaged. What's really remarkable is there's no real reason to rob the bank; Bev seemed to want to.<br /><br />Anyway, after their parents are caught, Dell and Berner are pretty much on their own. Neeva has arranged for a friend of hers to help them escape the foster system, but she's late getting there and Berner takes off on her own.<br />Neeva's friend drives Dell to Canada where he winds up working for a man named Arthur Remlinger who makes Bev Parsons look like a village parson. Dell has to earn his keep by working with a weirdo named Charlie Quarters who helps \\"Sports\\" hunt Canada geese. Dell helps him scout the pits from where the sports will shoot the geese and clean them afterwards. Arthur Remlinger owns a hotel where the \\"Sports\\" stay. Arthur has some strange political ideas, including a special antipathy towards syndicalism, which got him in trouble when he was young and on his way to a career as a lawyer. He never got over it.<br /><br />Arthur's girlfriend Florence saves Dell from the geese pits and he's given a job swamping out rooms at the hotel. He's even allowed to clean the aloof Remlinger's room, which gives him an opportunity to snoop. From then on Dell is Remlinger's prot&eacute;g&eacute;, only Dell realizes he's only along to feed Remlinger's ego.<br /><br />So we have three characters--Bev Parsons, his son Dell, and Arthur Remlinger--who all face a life-changing circumstance and react in different ways. The book is disappointing in one respect; we never find out what happened to some of the major characters and Ford doesn't give us any hints. It's also kind of hard to believe that Dell Parsons would go from having his parents rob a bank to the predicament he's confronted with in Canada.

It's also kind of hard to believe that Dell Parsons would go from having his parents rob a bank to the predicament he's confronted with in Canada. That's just too Joe Btfsplk (See Al Capp) to be believed.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have been reading Stephen King off and on for 20ish years.  11/22/63 is absolutely one of my favorites.  I rarely read a book twice, but this will be one I'll read again (and hopefully enjoy it as much).  It captured my attention from the very beginning and held me close.  It's 850 pages which I completed in 10 days.  I was reading at red lights, in the parking lot at work up until start time, after my little one went to bed, whenever I could steal a few spare minutes.  I will warn, there was a lull about 2/3 or so through but it picked back up again and delivered on every page.  I would highly recommend it.  :)
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Got this game for my 5 year old grandson. This was the game he wanted. He loved it. He played it as much as his other games.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|Does what it is supposed to do. Have had no problems so far.  Love the wireless connection and ease of installation
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I was expecting a good book from other reviews. Sledgehammer wrote what I consider the best first person account I have ever read in 4 decades of reading books on WWII. It is personal and poignant. The inhumanity of man to man is brought out as well as the tenderness of those who serve under great pressure. Best WWII book ever.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I did not like the ending at all-and the bouncing back and forth from Amy and her husband sometimes was confusing-I wouldn't recommend this book
B008M36ER0|5.0|This movie really surprised me it was funny and humires to my surprised I enjoyed it very much. Mel Gibson gives a great performance in his role movie plot was totally different than what's being shown lately on the movie's so was good to see something good.
B000IDEORY|5.0|good casting,directing,acting and music. some drama, I allways like happy endings. a good movie to have in my library to watch repetedly. should have spell chack for the reviews. review much too complicated to do
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was a great book that was worth reading... I would recommended it to anyone, and I can't wait until the 2nd book comes out in April.
B00000DGUY|5.0|Cd in very well stands receive, rapid and perfect settlement of this buy. A very well salesman a score worth of 10/10.<br /><br />Cd in prima staat ontvangen, vlugge en perfecte afhandeling van deze koop. Een prima verkoper een score waard van 10/10.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read a ton of police procedural mysteries and thought this was one.  It is not but was a very enjoyable book to read.  Lots of twists and turns.  After reading this I also read Gillian Flynn's other two books.  Also very good.  Gone Girl was surprisingly funny in parts so it was a nice change from straight up mysteries.
B00846REIS|5.0|Wonderful book a lot like the fifty shades series I like this one a lot I can't wait for the next one to come out in October I'm enthralled with Gideon cross and can't wait to delve deeper into his pyhsce
B005GG0MIS|4.0|A highly entertaining read, and a fascinating insight into the world of the men who have held this office - the hardest and most impossible job on the planet. Very well written - though I must admit that it somehow turned a bit long towards the end.
B008Y6YLBG|5.0|This movie is dark and tense, but really, really good.  Jennifer Lawrence is twice as good here as she was in Hunger Games.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie, very close to the book with lots of action and excitement. Excellent transaction, on-time delivery as promised. Can't wait for the other 2 movies!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I love how Anthony Ryan mixes in faith with politics and keeps it historically accurate (in the general sense) and contrasts the two different agendas. The core of the story is the loyalty of friends who met under circumstances that none had control over,  abandoned to a place that I will only describe as a foster home... That teaches them survival, duty,  and how to kick ass.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The book was really great as the characters were more romantic, loving and a little bit normal. Christian learned to forgive, love and have a better self esteem of himself, it just made me smile every time he attempted to do something for Ana just to make her happy. The ending was great and I couldn't ask for more but wanted to read more about the crazy life of Christian Grey and Ana.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|King got the historical details right in this novel about a man who travels back in time to try and stop Pres. Kennedy's assassination. Intertwined within that quest is a love story and about living life in the present. The ending was a bit out of line with the rest of the book, but overall thoroughly enjoyed reading it.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|Still Alice is a well written fictional story about an intelligent, independent Harvard professor who experiences some memory problems. When she finally goes to see her doctor the news is devastating. Even though she is not yet 50, she is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Her struggles to keep her health, her career, her family and her self are page turning fascinating.<br />Lisa Genova did some extensive research to write this book from the perspective of the main character. The story is about Alice's struggles, but it is also about how it might feel to lose that part of you that is most important to us: our memories of who our loved ones are. The story (spoiler alert) does not have a happy ending, as anyone who has experienced the decline of a loved one with AD knows. There is no cure and the medications we currently use are minimally effective at best.<br />Well worth the read.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I wasn't sure I was going to like it but I DID! I really don't want to write about the movie...watch it and find out for yourself. I don't want to ruin it for anyone.
B0043RSJ8G|1.0|It was a terrible book and I do not recommend it to anyone.  I was very disappointed in it.  I am very sorry that I wasted my money on it.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|You love it or hate it. I just loved it. I am not a middle-aged housewife but I liked very much the way the book presents the inner thoughts of Christian and Ana. Ok, you can read Tolstoi after that for a change!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Loved this fast shipping great price would definately buy again.  I use this for my craft work and I have gotten great feedback from my customers as well.  Thanks stains
B004SYP5WC|4.0|Wonderful!!!!  Really keeps you on track to pay those darn bills on time. Worth the cost. I would definitely recommend.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good game. clean graphics. and addictive. good fun way to pass the time. expecially if you work the night shift...
B006LSZECO|5.0|Flynn's main characters, who could be the couple next door, expose personalities and relationships that will make you wonder just WHO does live next door. A must read......you won't want to put it down!
B00355L2TU|5.0|Two weeks in and already down 10 lbs and 1 dress size. Love the results I am getting! It is definitely worth buying!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I liked watching this movie, there were some interesting underlying statements. The ending,however, was predictable.  There was insufficient background on the \\"parachutes\\" and how and who got them (should have expanded on that aspect), you will have to see it to understand this comment.<br /><br />There was some tokinism I did not appreciate, but all in all I liked it.  Not worth seeing twice.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Not nearly as good as the book, of course, but it did a pretty good job of sticking to the storyline. Casting was very well done.
B008PSPNFG|5.0|Great representation of what Steve does while introducing awesome new material. Some of it reminds me of \\"Passion and Warfare\\". I think he is the best guitarist in the world. I really love \\"Weeping China Doll\\" and \\"John The Revelator\\".
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of my favorites.  It is very important to read the book before seeing the movie as the movie skims over the building of the characters and you may be a bit lost for the first 45 minutes or so.  Once the action starts it is a very engrossing and interesting movie.  I loved it.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Great product for viewing multiple feeds at the flick of the finger. Nice assortment of news and social feeds to choose from including Facebook, Twitter and AP News.
B0027MJU00|5.0|If you're looking to get lost and wrapped up in a book, Gillian Flynn is your go to author. After inhaling her novel Gone Girl, I instantly downloaded her other two novels and dug right in. Dark Places is exactly that. Throughout the plot, you are taken deep down into the dark and ugly pits of the human psyche. The chraracters range from warm and bubbly to evil and sordid. The tale ends with an unexpected twist which I have now come to expect from Flynn. I loved this book and highly recommend it to fiction lovers.
B008602KQI|4.0|Great movie to sit down and watch on a inactive day, another strong female lead. I can't wait for hunger Games part 2.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the HUNGER GAMES.  Of course the book was better than the movie but I think it was OK
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I had heard what a wonderful read this was...I was misinformed!  Most of the book (and the other 2 in the series) is nothing but a narrative that would be better suited to a mens-room magazine. Once you have read the first 100 or so pages, you have read pretty much everything this author has to write about.  I read the first book in the series and purchased the other two to see if they got any better...they didn't.  I had to skip a lot of pages that were the same thing written over and over again. Not much for story line, not much plot.  Ok book if you want something you don't have to really pay attention to!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is not just for teens or woman its a great read for men aswell and im a 42 yr male and i enjoyed it and had to carry on reading the second one in the trilogy<br />Enjoyed it very much so its defo worthwhile reading - its different and i guess thats why its a hit worldwide - enjoy and happy reading
B006RUJST6|4.0|I loved this book. Fast read. I definitely want to read slammed 2 now. Loved the characters and the story line.
0439023521|3.0|While a really interesting story, the actual writing leaves something to be desired.  I started reading it because I thought the movie was pretty good, but it was hard to read because of Suzanne Collins inexperienced writing style.
B000JZ3TYA|4.0|I saw this movie years ago and wanted a friend to see it. We tried all vidoe rental options, our TV providers movies...no where! It is a nail biter even though I knew the story AND the totally surprise ending.
0385504209|5.0|Keep in mind that this novel is fiction and it is a great thriller.  If you're particularly sensitive about books about religion, or have issues remembering this book is not meant to be factual, you probably wont enjoy it.  Regardless, Dan Brown is a great writer.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I loved this book. It was not as good as the white queen but still a rich intently interesting book. I pre-ordered on my kindle and had planned to read it the weekend it was released... At midnight the book was delivered. I decided to read a couple chapters before bed and ended up reading nearly half the book! Once you start you can't stop.<br /><br />I wish Gregory could release books faster. I gobble them up and then impatiently await the next.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because it was not as good as Gregorys white queen, the queens fool and wildeacre but still very good!
0765350386|5.0|Brandon Sanderson writes books really well.  He uses fantasy with a little bit of romance and great character relationships.  He does an amazing job of letting the story unfold with a great shock at the end.  If you're questioning reading this book, don't.  It's great for everyone; I've recommended it to all my friends and no one has said anything but great things.
B008602KQI|5.0|Many films like this don't transfer to the small screen well - but not trie with this one! The film is great and follows the original book nearly to the line. If you like futuristic action with minimal special fx - this is a no miss!
145162607X|5.0|After reading The White Queen and The Red Queen, The Kingmaker's Daughter surprised me by almost making me cheer for a girl I pretty much already hated.  Gregory is good at taking on a completely different perspective.
B000JNN0SM|1.0|Not as good as origional DVD.  Suppressed dialogue.  Boosted bass.  Clipping on effects.  Video poor, same as old DVD.  One new scene.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|A fascinating book with extraordinary characters.  The exclusivity of the members of the Club,<br /><br />unique and very special ppeople all, makes for a compellingly good read.  I highly recommend<br /><br />it, and I thank Amazon for making it available on my Kindle.
B008602KQI|5.0|This was an amazing film, and I love it! It has everything you could want in a movie: drama, comedy, romance, and plenty of action. I don't usually purchase DVD's, but this is a special movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is hard to put down. Many twists and turns. My husband and I both read it and we both enjoyed it.<br />I'm not a fan of scary mystery books. This was a mystery without the scary factor--so no nightmares. I reccomend this book.
B0022Y570K|5.0|great music, great band, recommend it to anyone and I do not even listen to hard rock music, something about volbeat that has a great sound
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very entertaining but I was a little disappointed with the ending. I wish that Nick would have not stayed with the psycho wife.  It just seemed completely messed up.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a must try app ; I've try many Bible apps ; but this is one of my favorites.  It has many features
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Very average writing and absolutely no character development.  I am suppose to feel for these characters and I feel nothing.  All this is is gratuitous sex.  I like something a little more original than porn.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is an excellent production with wonderful detail and dialogue.<br />I am very much looking forward to Season 3.  I hope there will be more shows/series as good as this one.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|setting aside the fact that it is not as good as the books. the acting was bad, the actors for many of the characters didn't fit the characters they were playing. overall it was just a bland movie. not worth buying.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the Hunger Games series. I was doubtful the movie could convey the power of the book. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the story line and the feel of the book that came through on the screen. I know much was cut from the book, but the movie was an excellent portrayal of the book. The items left out of the movie were well chosen and the movie conveyed the message and feel of the book. The movie would have needed to be much longer to flesh it out to match the book, the movie would have suffered if it were longer. I think The Hunger Games movie was beautifully done with respect for the message of the book. I am looking forward to the next movie in the series.<br /><br />Allen Schweiger
B007N6ZH5M|5.0|I would highly recommend this book. It contains new trends in emerging market economies from extensive research done by the Author. It covers the demographics and growth rates of \\"breakout nations\\" worldwide. In the last decade we have seen a transfer of wealth from the east to the west resulting in an increase in the standard of living and disposable income for the countries involved. I read the book from cover to cover.
B000I9TY4G|5.0|Wonderful Sci-Fi Movie and an amazing conclusion to a phenomenal series. Watch the series Firefly first if you haven't as this movie follows after the series ends and has spoilers. Well worth your time. All hail Joss Whedon!
B000N2HCM4|1.0|I felt I was reading a story about a Narcissist who was trying to justify how great he thought he was. It could have been about a \\"Hitler\\" in the making. I read it to the end and felt so discouraged, knowing this man today.
B00479SVBU|5.0|This music player is one of the coolest things I have ever had my hands on.  You can record off your music cd's,from your computer and play the songs on your radio though your cigarette lighter plug.  Very clean and crisp music.  I highly recommend this cool unit and I sure like it as it is easy to transfer from one vehicle to another.  There are many free cd converters to use from the internet.<br />You can put music in folders (a lot of music).  More than you can listen to in one day.  It is price right too.  I know you will have fun with this unit.  I have had mine for awhile now and it works excellent!
B005K01VZS|5.0|Truly inspirational book, I've bought several hard copies to give out, and have the Kindle version for myself. A required read for anyone who has questions, or just for a lift!
B0026OR1UK|5.0|The talent code explains how we learn and what practices and procedures are employed by those who excel above and beyond the norm.  It also discusses why there are clusters of talent such as a hugely disproportionate number of major league baseball players coming from the Dominican Republic.  Based on scientific facts, it is nevertheless an easy read and easily understood.  Excellent for students or anyone else who wants to learn or master a specific talent.
B002361MLA|5.0|This book is a great help for those in the awakening process.  It is full of great ideas and suggestions for changing how we look at things.  For those seeking spiritual guidance and ways in which to better their lives, it is a must read!
B004TI5N38|4.0|The action was set at a modiste build up but when it got going it was full tilt...the knowledge of the material presented was phenomenal
B008BM9L72|1.0|This is the worst written drivel that I have ever come across. Absolutely no story line and the sex scenes don't compensate.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|After reading the 3 books in the series of Hunger Games I couldn't wait for the CD to come out.  I felt the movie left out some of the more important parts of the book.  The books keep you guessing what is around the corner, the movie didn't do that!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Having read the book I found the video to be true to its storyline. It was exciting and a fun experience.
B005USZML4|4.0|Grisham is a good story-teller and I found all three Theodore Boone books entertaining. Probably a good choice(s) if you are having trouble getting into that next \\"heavy\\" piece of literature! Dmmamelia
B003O86FMW|5.0|The whole book kept my attention the whole time, when I finished I couldn't wait to start the next one.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I love this book, I was going to re-read The Secret and when I went online to order it, I came across The Magic.  It was the food my soul was craving and wanted.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I found the writing to be extremely engaging and thought the author did a great job of writing this complex psychological thriller from the perspective of both the husband and the wife. However, I was disappointed in the ending. It was not the choice the author made of how to end the book that bothered me but rather they way she did not develop the ending. The author did an excellent job of weaving this story but I felt like she just stated what happened in the end and did not spend enough time developing the ending.It was a fun book to read but I cannot give it 5 stars.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Very helpful. Easy to understand language and easy to follow instructions.<br />[[ASIN:B008VUMEYQ Navigating the Passages of Marriage]]<br />[[ASIN:B008VXTWBG Tucker's Way]]<br />[[ASIN:B008Y2FPA6 For Tucker]]
B008966SLM|5.0|I don't give 5 star reviews, and probably wouldn't here but I don't have a 4 1/2 star option. However, this is as close as modern blues and music these days in general will come to deserving a 5 ***** review. Grammy watch is on. I can't think anyone is going to release a better CD in the \\"Blues\\" category in 2012.<br /><br /> None of his last 3 CD's were bad: \\"This Time\\", \\"Twenty\\" and \\"Time Will Tell\\" were all good in there own right, especially \\"This Time\\" and each one an improvement over the last. You could feel Robert and his band creeping out from the doldrums of the releases \\"Shoulda Been Home\\" and \\"Take Your Shoes Off\\"  in the early 2000's which, for me anyway, were a low point in a Hall of Fame career. However, you can sense a new energy here, a reinvigorated Robert Cray coming on in an even more confident cool, if that is possible. His ringing, crying and chiming guitar is in great form and his singing is better than ever. I have to think that having Richard Cousins back in the band helps. He is a fantasitc bass player to compliment the virtuosity of Jim Pugh on the keyboards, both of whom contribute to songwriting as they did on \\"This Time\\". They even have horns on a few songs,not the Memphis Horns, but great horns. RC's blues flavor occasionally goes great with a side of horns. (see 1986-1996)<br /><br />Bottom line, BUY THIS CD ! But, GO SEE THEM LIVE ! They are one of the tightest bands you will see touring.<br /><br />Favorite songs: The whole CD, listened to in it's entirety.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is a very interesting book. I am  normally not a reader but I have already read book 1 and started on book 2. Cant wait to find out what happens next.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This app is really very good. It has fixed a lot of the problems I was having when using pinterest through the web on my kindle fire. The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because you can't edit your pins. For example I have pins in a board I want to transfer to a different board and can't. It isn't a matter of the action not working the app doesn't even offer the option. But all be it the app works better than just using pinterest through the web. I really do love the app despite its one little hiccup.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Good series. Season 2 was a little slow, but I still give it five stars. If you don't watch walking dead, you should.. or don't.. I don't care.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Well written and an ending that sumed up the entire story. I really did not think I would like the series but I am a fan.
B004FYH2MQ|4.0|In what seems to be a dramatic and unfortunate chain of events turns out to be a hilarious comedy of retribution. The main character, Brazil, is shot in the head by a stray bullet and looses everything. He attempts to hold the manufacturer of the bullet responsible for his injury by confronting them directly and, of course, ends up being tossed to the curb. He meets a group of vagrants who make a living refurbishing and repurposing discarded junk. This eclectic group of unusual characters becomes Brazil's allies in a plot to turn two arms manufactures against one another, and help them see the error of their ways.  What I found most enjoyable about this film is Jean-Pierre Jeunet's artistic use of sets, scenery, and situations to tell a story full of moral goodness and human indomitability. Featuring a performance from Dominique Pinon, I quickly found myself immersed in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's world of Micmacs. Like many of his other films, a series of unconnected satires come together in a climatic finish, so seamlessly it feels something magical just happened to you. Plus, I just love listening to people speaking French.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was not able to put the book down. The content and story line was much different from what I usually read. This book left you wanting to know more.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|quell and quell reflect are among my favorite puzzel games. peacefull calming complicated and satisfying to solve. great graphics. simple premis. top work.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book is quite good!  Not as much sex as a lot of people think and not as explicit as a lot of other books I've picked up only to put back down.  This book has tradgety and triumph and is even a love story.  I am recommending this book to my friends and family!
B0049J3RBC|4.0|Kids and Husband loved it. I found it a bit boring in spots, but all in all a great family flick.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Great character development,the plot is classic. Hard to put down,one of the best books I've read this year. Don't miss it.
B004G8Y0D0|5.0|This movie is awesome. Grew up watching the TV show as a kid and it brought back so many memories.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Another great episode in the Jack Reacher series.  Lee Child makes it extremely hard to put your kindle down.  You will enjoy it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|FINALLY FINISHED THE TRILOGY.  THE TYPE OF STORY THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO KEEP READING.  WOULD LIKE IT TO GO ON AND ON.  SORRY IT ENDED BUT LIKED THE ENDING.
B007SGM084|2.0|I only finished the first book in the trilogy because I didn't 'hate' it.  But, I will not waste more time with the next 2 segments as I am so-not interested in 'more-of-the-same'. I consider the writing to be mediocre and juvenile.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The Night Circus is a highly entertaining masterwork that looks (in part) at humans' perceptions versus reality and their ability to change the world around them. I wish my dreams were as evocative and imaginative as Morgenstern's circus...or to be invited and meet the characters at one of the founders' midnight dinners...or to be a kid in a tree in Concord, Mass. when the circus appears mysteriously in a field on the horizon.<br /><br />This is just a great story, my hat is off to the author for creating a unique and immersive reading experience.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|It's a very interesting, fact based book. But what I liked the most it's its easiness to read, cause some authors believe that by using technical language they'll be better rated and the only thing that does is bore people while reading them.<br /><br />Great Book!
B006LSZECO|3.0|As an avid reader this book is just OK.  The story jumps around and at times seems to ramble.  There is no question, the book is very well written, but overall my impresion is \\"just that it is OK.\\"
B004EAMXFM|4.0|There were holes in the story and the acting was just average. M.Night Shyamalan has made better films than this one.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is leaps and bounds better than the original. The cinematography is gorgeous as always, but the dynamic between Watson and Holmes (Jude Law and Robert Downey Junior) is really in full swing here.
B000TEMRIU|5.0|Great album for 5 bucks had to have it!!! Timeless classic that you can't go wrong with buying!  good sound too!
B005VT42BS|1.0|The app didn't do what I expected it to do or what it was advertised to do. I uninstalled it.
B004FPZ2G8|5.0|A classic.  Deserves to be read multiple times.  After Pride and Prejudice this is my favorite Austen.  I own paperback but found Kindle format to be equally enjoyable.  Do wish alternate Austen ending was also included in this edition.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Great, suspenseful story that leaves you thinking about the characters long after you've finished the book.  Gillian Flynn is my favorite new author.
B004VMUS9G|2.0|I love all the different sounds, but even at it's loudest, this wasn't very loud.  If you are a heavy sleeper, this wouldn't be for you.  Would work best for those quick cat naps.
B008KMHFJY|2.0|This book took a long time to heat up a little unbelievable<br />i have read better. As far as comparing this book to fifty<br />they are nothing alike teenage book compares to adult book
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Not fully by choice though. :-) This was a purchase for my 12 year old. Absolutely loved the fact that we got the digital version on Amazon Video with it so that she was able to watch it at midnight. This should be a standard thing with every DVD/Blu-ray purchase.  Saved me a trip to the store that night to buy a copy as she and her friends had been bouncing off the walls waiting for midnight in order to watch it.<br /><br />Quality of both the DVD and digital copy were top-notch - though the extras were pretty boring and seemed like more of an after-thought than anything else.<br /><br />Now if I could only convince my daughter to watch something else...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a steamy, erotic book, my little ecscape from mommyhood!  Easy read and definately worth the money I spent 2 have on my kindle!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book was great to have insight on what a person going through a near death experence goes through.  It really helps you not be fearful of death.  good book
B003MOHX8S|5.0|It is truly a privilege to have access to such an amazing album. If you at all enjoy the epic soundtrack genre, you will love this album.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Awesome story! Throughout the entire book I was on the edge of my seat and could barely set the book down. When I got to the end it left me looking for more pages, just hoping that I didn't just read the last page because the ending was \\"flat\\"compared to the rest of the book. I hope that this isn't the way all of Gillian's books end!
B00355L2TU|5.0|I just started doing this DVD a week ago and I really like so far. It quick, but very intense.
0071752854|1.0|I read a few pages of this book and was compelled to literally throw it into the trash... Just terrible advice. I beg young salespeople out there to not read this filth.  It's basically \\"the game\\" applied to sales.  Unadulterated crap.
B0086DBE62|1.0|It's so bad we turned it off. A waste of time and $$.  It isn't for kids AND it isn't for anyone.  Usually anything w Julia is ok, but not this time.  Take a nap instead, it will be more interesting!
B008K3HRF0|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves this movie, she's watched it about 100 times already. She watches it at least once a day.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I found this book to be very shallow & demeaning to women on a whole. I would not recommend this book toy worst enemy.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|After reading the first book in the series - which I found poorly written and VERY repetitive - I almost didn't go on, but the author had hooked me in the story line and I wanted to read what would happen, and if it got any better. I read what happened and it didn't get any better. I'll not read the third book in the Trilogy.
B005NKGEP2|5.0|never lets you lose the \\"momentum\\"in the story! Easy to follow ,even with all the characters.Very believable.....<br />I'LL RAED ALL THE AUTHORS WORKS!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game, because of the music, easy play style, and content is agreat game for anyone. It's a great time waster and overall good
B007MU85D0|5.0|This album is amazing. the music is awesome and the songs are different from each other which makes it an amazingly musically diverse CD.
B004LSO6YI|2.0|Movie kept stopping and was not in focus,I wil not be renting anymore movie, I just gave money away that night for a bad experience.
B008602KQI|5.0|I had read the book and the movie is just as I expected it would be. It was exciting. The actors matched the caricature they were portraying. I would buy it again.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|The book is very cute, warm, quirky, and entertaining. Nice book set in Europe during the German Occupation. Folks in their 50's and up would enjoy this much more than younger generations.
B008JH5CVS|4.0|Enjoyed the movie and felt it was very good. Enjoyed the movie and would recomend to freinds. Happy I did not go to the theater to see it would have been enoyed spending the money. But still liked movie and like owning it. Would suggest to freinds.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|The characters were alright. I thought Travis was a bit over the top, but I kind of liked that whirl wind uncontrollable passion thing he had going on. Abby was a bit bland. She could of been more interesting from the hints the author gave but I really didn't feel connected to her. The book could of used a flashback or something to give the reader a better idea of the life she was trying to escape. The trip to Vegas provided a bit of that, but it wasn't enough. The sexual tension was well developed and so was the angst-y lust but the sex scenes themselves were a total flop - there was no detail and it seemed over before they even started. I expected way better lovin' from Travis - the supposed campus stud and his uncontrollable hotness - but at times he came across as a total high maintenance drama queen. The college fight club story line was weird. Who does that? But something had to make him some sort of bad ass I guess. This book is not a model for a healthy relationship or how to behave as an adult - making it an easy leap to criticize the author for the hot headed nearing domestic violence like storyline. But as far as book candy with no nutritional value?  I ate it all in one sitting.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|wonderfully, exciting and breathtaking book will recommend it anytime. It took me two days to read all of if, just couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read the Trilogy.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I felt for all the characters. I loved that Will wrote poetry, that he inspired those around him to do the same.  He just seemed like a really great guy, solid and honest.  What I didn't like is that it turned out to be one of those books where they ended up getting married before they had sex.  What is that about?  I think authors too often use marriage as an easy way to slam home the significance of a relationship.  Unfortunately, a lasting relationship is way more than that.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Just finished it.  The book does not criticize the President. And, the book takes pains to point out that the President's announcement of the success of the mission and UBL's death was appropriate. The President did not leak details, but plenty of others did. What the book does is quite a bit, however, only the last 1/3rd of the book talks about the actual operation. The book was not vetted the way military regulation almost certainly requires. If it had been, the book would not have been published. Still not sure exactly how I feel about all of this, but I do know that it is an amazing book. And, other than the description of how the actual killing of ULB occurred, there is little information that gives anything away that would be considered classified.<br /><br />This book is about the men (and a woman!) directly involved in getting this done. The author -- in this case the teller to the author -- was more interested in telling the story of the exceptional people who carried this mission out, that is the ones who 'got' UBL. The President, as the Commander in Chief, certainly deserves credit for having the 'cojones' to give the order to get it done. But, again, the book is about the people who did the doing to carry out the order.  The author maintains that he wanted the real story told.  There is heroism and it is brutal.  But, more than that it is about the incredible military and intelligence professionals at the 'tip of the spear.'<br /><br />Spent 27 years in the Air Force, not saying that because I want to establish bona fides saying that because the Air Force takes justifiable heat! They wanted to bomb Curt LeMay style UBL's compound back to the stone age. There would have been tremendous collateral (read civilian deaths) damage and we never would have been certain we had really gotten UBL. If the book is critical of anyone it is some military brass and that is part of the reason the book resonates.  Generals who wanted to get in on a piece of the action also deservedly take heat, but not by name. Having known several prima donna generals that has a definite ring of truth. \\"I'm a general officer, certainly I have a need to know.\\" And, the other things criticized are the ways the 'brass' makes the special ops guys, soldiers, sailors, marines and yes, even airmen do so much 'cya' bs. The book is not critical of Admiral Mullen and Secy Gates. Ah, C Y A err, cover your ahh okole.<br /><br />Adding some stuff ... in part, this book could be called how not to fight a war ... \\"Everything in Afghanistan was getting harder.  It seemed with every rotation we had new requirements or restrictions.  It too pages of PowerPoint slides to get a mission approved.  Lawyers and staff officers pored over the details on every page, making sure our plan was acceptable to the Afghan government. We noticed there were fewer assaulters on missions and more \\"straphangers,\\" each of whom performed a very limited duty.  We now took conventional Army soldiers with us on operations as observers so they could refute any false accusations ... On our last deployment, we were slapped with a new requirement to call them out.  After surrounding a building, an interpreter had to get on a bullhorn and yell for the fighters to come out with their hands raised.  ... After the fighters came out, we cleared the house.  If we found guns, we arrested the fighters, only to see them free a few months later.  Often we recaptured the same guy multiple times during a single deployment.\\"<br /><br />and:<br /><br />\\"... but now we had to do sensitive site exploration, which we called SSE.  Basically, we shot pictures of the dead, gathered up any weapons and explosives, and collected thumb drives, computers and papers. SSE had evolved over the years.  It had become a way to rebut false accusations that the fighters we killed were innocent farmers.  We knew that within a few days of the raid, the village elders would be down at the local NATO base accusing us of killing innocent civilians.  The kind of innocent civilians who we knew and could now prove carried RPGs and AK-47s.  The more SSE we provided, the more proof we had that everyone we shot was guilty.\\"<br /><br />---- did we learn nothing from Vietnam and Korea?  This old Viet vet is kinda sad.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Fantastic book. Creditable world and people. It is clear to me why Robert Jordan would chose this writer to continue his legacy, the Weel of Time.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I loved this movie - more than the first one, surprisingly.  Everything comes together beautifully in the second go-around. The casting is spot on, the humor never takes you out of the action, and the story is fun ride.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of Sherlock Holmes or any new converts!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Amazing books that will touch you in just about every way possible. Introduces you into an entirely different world and takes you through so many different emotions. Great read! You won't regret it!!!!
B004Q7CIFI|3.0|This story entertained me just as most Stephen King books do. I enjoyed the premise and how he used it to explore the idea of how we decide what we can and should do - given there are some things we should not do even though we can. As with many Stephen King stories I have read, the narrative in this one bogs down through the middle leaving me near the point of quitting due to a lack of interest in non-consequential details. The story is well-ended and overall a good book and a good value.
B008602KQI|5.0|Well, of course, the book is much better! After watching the movie with a friend, she wanted to read the book.  Can't wait for the 2nd video.  I liked Woody Harrelson and Donald Sutherland in the movie.
B005FISBTO|1.0|I know how your little minds work. You wish that everyone who buys this DVD set would instead buy a subscription to your network and provide you with an ongoing revenue stream. So somehow you imagine that you can achieve this goal by forcing purchasers of these DVDs to watch a 3 minute commercial for your various programs every time they run one of the disks.<br /><br />Well, Showtime Networks, I have news for you. This tactic isn't gaining you a lot of fans. And telling folks it's actually Paramount who's responsible for how these DVDs are put together is disingenuous at best. (You may need to look up that big word. But it should not make you feel good about yourselves.)<br /><br />Oh, yes, and it really was rather careless of you to include a major spoiler in the Dexter trailer. Now I suppose some viewers will be content to know what is going to happen and watch the 13 episodes out of curiosity for how the story gets from Point A to Point B. But most of them having watched seasons of Dexter before will already anticipate most of that trajectory. That's why so many reviewers here are furious about how Paramount, I mean you, put this set together.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I very much like the application. I think the format with which mail from Yahoo is presented could be improved. The functionality of being able to review and respond to my mails from my Kindle is very beneficial
B008GX2YQQ|3.0|There will be plenty written about this record in the coming weeks, so I'll keep it brief.  I've been a fan of AC for at least the last 6 albums and have enjoyed their musical perambulations, even when other fans looked askance at the rougher sound of Strawberry Jam or the heavy synth sessions of MPP.  After the first 4 tracks of their latest, I was sure the band had hit a new high--combining the more grinding, industrial textures of SJ with the synth psychedelia of MPP.  Problem is (for me at least): the album is completely front loaded.  The hooks simply aren't so well honed in the second half of the album is my assessment.  Granted I've not loved every song the band has released in the past, but Centipede Hz serves up more than a few that truly annoy me with their sloppy singsong vocals and plodding bass-lines.  After about 10 listens, I can safely say that nothing after Applesauce is likely to merit many further listens for me.  I'm certainly not put off by the dense arrangements or the gurgling and burbling synth work; I simply don't find the underlying pop song writing to have the simplicity or beauty that I find in so much of AC's music.  To be clear, I think the first four tracks are really endearing and will get plenty of play around here.  It's just that I'm unlikely to let the album play any further than that.<br /><br />Shame.  Such high expectations for a proper AC reunion album...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loves everything about this book. Only took me 4 days to read it. Just finished the second book. Can't wait to read the 3 one!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book and could not put it down.  The plot is filled with surprising turns and I never would have guessed the ending.  Great suspenseful writing!
B003MXD694|5.0|We have watched this at least 5 times!  Our family loves this amazingly clever and visually wonderful film.  I am someone who rarely watches a movie twice, so this is saying a lot.  Great humor and cute story line.  Our ten and thirteen year old boys enjoyed it as much as we did.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Look, after reading \\"Fearless\\" it's hard to find anything that measures up. That being said, this was a good book. It took me only two days to read it. I enjoyed reading the author's background leading up to his deployment. The last half of the book dealing with the actual Osama mission was tightly written and kept my attention. I'm glad I bought the Kindle edition and glad the story has been told. OK, so maybe all Navy SEALS are not perfect and have egos. I thought this author bent over backwards to give credit to ALL those involved in tracking and planning this mission. He and others like him are heroes. Period.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|This season was as good as the first. Excellent writing, great suspense. I was sad that it was over. Can't wait for next season!
0307744434|4.0|Let me start by saying that this is a \\"meaty\\" book. What the heck do I mean by that, you ask? \\"Meaty\\" books are books that you have to pay close attention to when you read. If you have read A Discovery of Witches by Deborah Harkness or any of the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon you know what I mean. This book requires you to be focused as you read otherwise you will be utterly and completely lost. I found myself backtracking quite a few times because of this. It isn't that I don't pay attention when I read, but most books you can drift a little and still not lose the basic storyline.<br /><br />I absolutely LOVE the cover and the color scheme that was used for this book! Red, black, and white (one of my favorite color schemes) are used on the cover--a fabulous looking black and white circus tent with red accents and lots of recommendations from friends led me to requesting this book from my local library. I will definitely be purchasing this one at some point, if for no other reason then that I love the cover and it will look pretty on my bookshelf. :)<br /><br />This book was slow to start for me and it took quite a while before I started to get into it. It took me a while to finish it because I ended up having to go back so many times to re-read parts that I \\"missed\\" the first time due to my mind drifting. This story is about Celia Bowen and Marco Alistair, and essentially takes us through their interesting, magical, and sometimes tragic lives. There are a number of other characters introduced and these are the parts of the story that I found myself getting lost in while reading.<br /><br />I liked the character development in this book. We get to see Celia and Marco from a very young age and get to watch them grow up. They are rivals due to the fact that the men who trained them were at odds with one another. They both become integral players in The Night Circus and ultimately fall in love. Will this spell disaster for the other members of the circus? You will just have to read it to find out.<br /><br />Most of the Celia and Marco parts of the story were enjoyable, while some of the side stories were downright sad. I liked the man who made the clock and all of the people associated with the circus who met for dinner regularly. I did not like how some of their stories ended, though. You know me, I like my happy endings.<br /><br />This book was a great read. I enjoyed it and I am glad that I made myself stick it out and finish it. - Tammyjust have to read it to find out.<br /><br />Most of the Celia and Marco parts of the story were enjoyable, while some of the side stories were downright sad.

B005NS5CX4|5.0|Love this album, I think they are one of the best bands out there today.  Love their voices, very unique. Their songs really touch my heart.
B008602KQI|5.0|This was an awesome trilogy. I loved the movie and can hardly wait til the second movie and the third movie.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|DEFENDING JACOB is very well written and depicts the troubled minds of some youth in today's world. It also gives empathy to parents whose children are bullied. This book is entitled to reach/teach many adults who have or who work with teenagers who use today's cyberspace.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Gillian Flynn is hands down BRILLIANT. Her writing style is poetic, which is in direct contrast to the horrors, evil, and darkness she writes about. She goes deep into her flawed characters and delivers stories with unimaginable twists at the end. This was the first Flynn book I read. I devoured it. I devoured Gone Girl (which, in my opinion was not as good as Sharp Objects), and I'm in the process of devouring Dark Places. Knowing she has crazy twists I find myself wondering what could be the worst possible outcome, because likely that is the twist, and yet, she still tricks me every time.<br /><br />Sharp Objects has a brilliant plot. I know I've used brilliant already, but that's the only word I can think of that defines Gillian Flynn as a whole.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie! This will be one of the few I watch over and over. Only 10 or so have that affect on me.: )
B000J1AGQI|2.0|This movie is pretty long and it drags in spots.  The movie is definitely okay but certainly not great.  Not quite what I expected.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|LOVE this series.  Yes, lots of sex but a pretty story line too.  Took this book and the final book (Fifty Shades Freed) on vacation and just devoured them. Would recommend all three books.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|While this book incorporates elements of several recent best-selling series (Twilight, Outlander, and Harry Potter)it was a thoroughly enjoyable read. The characters are well formed, and there is a strong story line. After reading it I immediately downloaded the next installment in the series. I can't wait to find out what happens next!
B008602KQI|3.0|I was looking forward to the dvd release if The Hunger Games as I did not get a chance to see it in the theater.  For me it did not live up to the hype perpetuated in the reviews.  Though it was entertaining it was really lacking in over-all substance.  I could tell they were setting up for a sequel.  I will watch the next in the series on ppv but unless it is more well thought out it will probably be the last I will watch.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|This book is a good follow-up to \\"The Lady of the Rivers\\", also a Phillipa Gregory book, giving the reader another perspective from the same time period. \\"The Kingmaker's Daughter\\" is as enjoyable as previous books I have read by this author.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|its a great app anyone can use. easy to understand and easier to use. simple and easy controls to use
B005LQ6UE8|5.0|It's an incredible story about survival, determination, and friendship. Highly recommended. I was surprised at how emotionally invested I became in this book, I didn't want it to end.
B0055PMURG|5.0|Nicely done, motivating movie about this young gal.  What spirit and determination.  Good family movie. I hope her experience helps others to stay the course to follow their dreams as well.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Enjoyed the book very much. Looking forward to the movies for Catching Fire and Mockingjay.  The writer brought all charachters to life and really enjoyed following the journeys of the participants of the Hunger Games.
B008XG1X18|3.0|this app is awesome.. when it works properly. it has a tendency to freeze up and kick u out. needs to be fixed. I'm using it on my kindle fire and its pretty slow.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed the second of the trilogy very much.  Couldn't wait to get to the end of the book to see what happened and then couldn't wait to read MockingJay, the 3rd in the trilogy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent.  I enjoyed this series of books immensely.  They were far more than the erotic scenes and all the sexy language.  It was about two people in love and very well told.  So what does E.L. have for us next?
B001B3MCQK|5.0|Music fans of South Africa had this one right.  Seriously, how was this talented singer/songwriter overlooked?  Musicians today need to look to Rodriguez and others like him to understand how important substance is to music.  Without it all you have is glitter and annoying sounds.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This is a truly amazing read! I tell everyone I can to read this book! Truly a one of a kind.
B008MEM24S|5.0|its actually really fun if your like me u watch the show and you like games!!! you need to find the duck!
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved this movie so much that I watched the digital version twice before the actual DVD even arrived in the mail! I actually saw the movie before reading the books and while books are ALWAYS better, I really didn't feel like they had to cut too much out. I agree with some others that the budget could have been higher and put to better use, especially with the cameras.. but the movie itself, casting, acting, dialogue, and all were really intriguing. There aren't too many movies that I won't just rent from Redbox for a night and have enough of, but Hunger Games was an exception. A must-own.
B008602KQI|4.0|If you read the book the movie will not disappoint.<br />Slight changes were made but not too major to take away from the book's version.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence is great and the right choice.<br />Look forward to the following movies.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|this is great for Bible study especially the audio versions that help if your eyes are fatigued or cross referencing subjects
B008ASLK8A|3.0|The movie was not as fresh as the first but still entertaining enough.<br />Robert Downey Jr makes a good and funny Sherlock Holmes.
B008XBHBX2|5.0|The crispness the clarity were excellent.The addition of HD almost made it seem as if it was a new movie.
B007SGM084|3.0|Enjoyed the story line but as many reviews have already stated, way too much repetitiveness.  Also when finished I felt like the author was tired of it as well.  Skipped several years and then just ended.  Not happy with the amount of money I had spent for the triology but then again, I was warned, so others take heed.  Rent from the library or borrow but many many more books worth the money more so than this one.
B008602KQI|2.0|I can't believe I bought this movie. Seriously, the premise of kids killing kids to bring honor to their districts. Glad I did pay to take my family to see it at the theater.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the whole series! Would recommend to others over the age of 18. The story line kept you very involved. Hard to put down a real page turner.
B000I62JBE|3.0|not well told.  Dialogue was unnecessarily rough and at times uneven.  Brando was, well, not at his best, but wasn't given much.  Interesting premise and some good twists.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Use it often. Works well.  Easy to use. Can check weather in multiple areas quickly. Surprising that it has this level of functionality for free.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Delivers what was promised. Neat way to keep up with how many hours of music, video, surfing, etc. Can't believe it was free!
B0072NWJRK|3.0|I really enjoyed this tale of China before WW2 began with the Japanese ready to take over and the colonials in their last days.  I like factual books and this is one that will keep you interested until the last page.
B0086DBE62|4.0|I am a fan of Julia Roberts and it was especially fun to watch her play the villian in this amusing film. Some fun special effects and a really great twist on a well loved fairy tale.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|A good read for any artist, photographer or author who struggles to learn a new skill, perfect rusty skills or just has a mental block.  It may help to explain the feelings of frustration and encourage an artist to seek inspiration from the best without guilt.  I reread the book, which is most unusual, and felt it worthwhile.
B006LMMN8I|5.0|This is an amazing recording by Mr. Porter.  If you are a jazz lover than buy the CD,you won't regret it.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This was a great read.  I found myself laughing and crying and really feeling Harold's pain.  This book would make a great movie!
B000PC0SPU|4.0|Interesting commentary. I enjoyed this book and partially bought in to its' concepts. Yes, I believe there are valid points but I question the utility of the references. There are books and activities that I do not feel will increase \\"right-brain\\" power.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|You get a lot more of the background of the characters, and there is more story in this third volume of the trilogy so<br />If you have read the other two then you should reward yourselves with this one.<br />Don't read it unless you have read the other two though.
B001KQZ7I8|3.0|He survived immense and intense suffering. I thoroughly respect his strength and preference. I did not get much out of the book other than a description of a horrific experience. Ironically, this is exactly what he said the book was not about.
B006VRLNV6|5.0|I bought this already having the original cd but had not listened to any doors in years and in fact they had lost their allure. I wanted to hear the bonus tracks, the seminal versions. I was not dissapointed by the bonus tracks or the ones that actually made it on the album. I was blown away by the raw power of this album and fell in love with the doors all over again. Ray's organ playing is amazing. We don't need more cow bell we need more organ.
B007ELN8Y8|3.0|First - the Amazon streaming was a vast improvement on the Netflix setup we tried earlier this year.<br />We'd been watching a lot of old silent movies on the cable channels, so when we heard all the hype about The Artist, we put it on our must watch list. The production quality was excellent, but I was a little disappointed in the total story. Since you can't really multi-task when watching a silent movie - they had our full attention. It was a simple, one dimensional story. The only real novelty was that it was a silent movie. Fun, but not a movie I will ever watch again.
B004BDDJN2|2.0|The movie was slow going.  Good acting but not a good story line and sad and not upbuilding and a poor ending.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|After checking this app put for a couple days, with no faults found, I had my wife download it, my son play it & my daughter who's too cool for school try it.  We all love it.  We've all been playing constantly and having fun competing with it.
B0060D49VW|5.0|I love any movie with dancing.  So much talent.  The acting lacked a little but the dancing made up for it
B005RUV714|5.0|I love this show, I can't wait until it comes back on , this new season shows alot of promise but then again every episode has been a perfect 10, I must admit sundays have became my favorite day of the week because of this show , I hope the walking dead plays to run it's shows for many,many years .
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Beautiful love story! Travis is a beautiful character. This novel will definitely draw your attention, can't wait for the next one!
B007UXSKMU|5.0|Excellent... Great action and just the right amount of Tech...  The location kept me watching every aspect of the background...
B008602KQI|4.0|I think there was so much more in the book that could have been used in the movie.  I would still purchase the next movie if made from the second book.
B000SVZIR6|4.0|This movie was overall a pleasure to watch.  I learned a lot about the political background of that time period, and of the king and his motives for inviting the teacher.  The acting was excellent, as well as the cinematography.  There was some violence, so I would caution showing this to younger children.  It showed some dead bodies hanging from trees, beheadings, and another small part with killing.<br /><br />The one problem I had with this movie, however, is the same problem I had with 'The King and I', starring Yule Brennar: The romatic relationship between Anna and the king is untrue.  Reading her own autobiography you learn that the king actually disgusted her many times.  She was a Christian woman who shared her values and faith with his son, but she never had any sort of flirtatous dealings with his father. That is why I give it only 4 stars.
B008XFAT7S|5.0|This movie takes the Die Hard concept to the next level.  It is non-stop action and will leave you breathless by the final frame.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I've always found this game to be very addicting. And I couldn't wait to get it for my phone since I got it for all the other gaming devices. But for some odd reason I can't get the Zen garden. I've beaten the game mode and started the second round but haven't gotten the garden. When will I get it? Is there a Zen garden?
B008KWHM6U|5.0|I remember when I listened to Two Door Cinema Club for the first time. It was their song \\"Eat That Up, It's Good For You\\". I was immediately in love with the lyrical aspects and musical aspects of the song, I was so interested in hearing more from them, and after I listened to Tourist History from beginning to end, I immediately realized; I love every single song that TDCC has to offer. Two Door Cinema Club became my favorite band.<br />Now when I learned that a second record was in the works. I was thrilled, I couldn't wait, and I patiently anticipated the day I could get my hands on it, with just a slight bit of fear that it wouldn't live up to their amazing debut album. But let me just say that I was not disappointed in the least. Right away from the first track \\"Next Year\\"(one of my new favorites) I picked up on what the album was going to be like. This Album is a lot more mature, more serious, more developed. Its as if the first CD was all about being as interesting and fun as possible, all to find out what exactly the band wanted to sound like. And in this album, they have truly discovered the tone and the complexity that their music deserves. The lyrics this time around are a lot deeper and sentimental, they have more obvious emotional background, but this isnt a bad thing, the music fits perfectly with the words and this time around I feel like there is a lot more attention on Alex Trimble's beautiful voice, and with good reason. His voice is memorizing throughout the entire album.  Some songs were definitely more complex, catchy, and unique than others, but the overall feel and atmosphere of the album is apparent and TDCC pulls off an amazing listening experience from beginning to end. I'll admit that it took me more than one listen to truly appreciate this album, because the first time I was a bit skeptical about the new more mature sounding type of music, but after 2 listens I understood what TDCC was doing with this album and it became easy to fall in love with every song on the album. This is sincerely amazing work from an amazingly talented band that I continue to love. Alex, Sam, and Kevin have certainly proved themselves to be serious and downright brilliant with what they do. This album is MUST for anyone who enjoyed any of TDCC's previous work. Two Door Cinema Club has really given fans an amazing treat with this sophomore album. I cannot wait to see the incredible work that im sure will continue to come in the future from this near perfect band.ve with every song on the album.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved reading this book couldn't put it down until I was finished! Worth the purchase I only wish there was more to this series :(. I can't wait for the movie!!!
B007BVOF8E|5.0|This was purchased as a gift, and the recipient could not have been more pleased.  It's exactly what was ordered and arrived in a timely manner.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|was agreat idea but i had it turn up as loud as i could and still couldn't hear it.was a great ideal but turn it up
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book. I couldn't put it down waiting to see what happened next. Can't wait to read the last book
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I gave this 3 out of 5 stars, but then I'm tough to please.  I usually find Ken Follett a mixed read.  I really loved Pillars of the Earth - own it and have read it many times - but did not really care for its sequel. Some of the other Follett books before and after Pillers I read with mixed results. I started reading Fall of Giants when it fist came out and gave up.  I thought I would give it a second try - this time on the Kindle due to the book's large size. I don't dislike the book.  I'm half through it.  Parts of it interest me more than other parts. Some of the characters remind me of Upstairs-Downstairs or Downton Abby - which isn't a bod thing - only not original.  If I were reading the hard copy, I probably wouldn't finish due to the size and weight of the book. I do intend to finish my Kindle version.  It's not a book that I can't put down and have been reading other books (ones that are hard to put down) and then I go back to Giants. I'm hoping to like it a lot better as I keep going so I can read the next 2 in the trilogy.
0439023521|3.0|This book is very well written, and I read it all the way through. The author writes about children, but writes them in such a way that they become less childlike and more like adults. I think this is why these books are so wildly popular. I cannot get past the hate, and the killing of innocent children that these books are about. I have children, and I cannot imagine a world where they would be threatened.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|The Prisoner of Heaven by Carlos Ruiz Zafon is a great story in the tradition of The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexander Dumas. It is the third novel in the series by the popular Spanish writer designed to stand alone and pique the reader's interest in the first two novels, The Shadow of the Wind and The Angel's Game. Zafon calls these books \\"the literary universe of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books\\" in his introduction.<br /><br />In this novel, the action begins in 1957 in Barcelona at Christmas time. The main character, Fermin Romero de Torres is working in a bookstore owned by Senor Sempere and his son Daniel. Fermin, who is about to be married, leaves the bookstore one day to take care of marriage preparations. A mysterious crippled man painfully enters the store and buys an expensive copy of The Count of Monte Cristo. He inscribes a note in the novel and asks Daniel to deliver it to the person named in the note. After he leaves, Daniel reads the inscription and sees that the name is that of his friend, employee, and local bon vivant Fermin. It seems to Daniel that there is more to Fermin than meets the eye.<br /><br />The story moves back in time to 1939 to a location of a notoriously bad prison on Montjuic, a hill in Barcelona. Because of his anti-government activity, Fermin has been sentenced to an indeterminate sentence in the hellish institution where brutality and torture are daily occurrences. Fermin is thrown into cell 13. The narrative focuses on Fermin's life in the jail and the fellow prisoners he meets. A particularly interesting inmate is David Martin, a writer imprisoned for expressing supposed anti-government sentiments. He is being blackmailed to ghost-write material for the warden, Mauricio Valls, who claims the productions as his own creative work. Martin's bizarre ranting behavior has earned him the nickname of \\"the Prisoner of Heaven,\\" but there is a method to Martin's madness.<br /><br />The story unfolds with many twists and turns, friendships and betrayals, sacrifices and expressions of love. The resolution of the mystery surrounding the bookstore visitor is revealed to Daniel as the novel progresses from 1939 forward to 1957. This is an excellent novel that seemed to me flawlessly translated from the Spanish by Lucia Graves. I enjoyed every page of the The Prisoner of Heaven and will now go back and read the first two novels in the literary universe Zafon has created.ps and betrayals, sacrifices and expressions of love.

B00136Q4P0|5.0|Super deal! I was able to get all my favorite Michael Jackson songs all on one cd at a great price
B00139XTG4|4.0|I can't say that this book was fun, because I couldn't breeze through it but, as a PHD in Psychology who struggled through so many statistics courses, and had to use a statistical analysis to get my doctorate, it was an extremely interesting viewpoint:  Anyone  not hanging around the middle of the bell curve, on any measure, is going to have problems, large or small.  Same for events, making decisions, or predictions.  Who is the \\"average Joe?\\"  And is life, or our world predictable, really? Its a mistake to rely solely on numbers.<br /><br />I've had a lifelong struggle with math, so of course I was gratified to read  a cogent argument that numbers don't accurately describe everything.  I'm not sure what the author's Lebanese background had to do with anything.  Also did not appreciate his sneering attitude towards professionals who probably are not, like him, up there on the high end of the bell curve on measures like language facility, making money, philosophy, and just about everything else.<br /><br />I intend to read this book again.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I first saw this series on HBO. I was enthralled. I decided to read the books instead of waiting months for the next group of shows in the series. I love this experience: the characters, the plots, the fantasy which is never too absurd, the settings, the unusual creatures that inhabit the world (Oh, for a dire wolf of my own. I'll pass on dragon ownership.) I'm only sad because I'm now reading the last book, and I don't want this to end.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed the authors writing style and the middle and the end of the book were so riveting I could hardly put it down. The author tells the story from two points of view varying by chapter which i love- only issue was the beginning was a bit of a struggle- if I hadn't heard such good feedback on the book from others prior I may have stopped reading.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Gives u the real claustrophobic senseation! dont get attached to the first cool character you meet as the author  shows no mercy
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The 1984 of this generation. It moved at a good speed and caught the essence of the book, but implied the gore without actually showing it to keep it PG13.
B00338QENI|5.0|What an interesting book! I could hardly put it down when it was time to go to bed. It examines who really owns the samples taken during medical procedures, and follows one family's journey to discover what really happened to their mother. Also examines the inferior care received by poor blacks in the 1950's.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I just couldn't  wait to read this second book of the series. I was not disappointed ! I know that I will be reading it again in the future.I felt that even as an adult female that this  was an excellent read. I was moved by the characters and enjoyed the story line.
B000W061HE|5.0|Best soft rock album ever.  I put it on on my way to work, and I'm playing it again this weekend. Highly recommended.
B0055DKSQ8|2.0|It was far to drawn out with everyone psychoanalyzing themselves. Would have been more interesting to have focused on the environmental issues. And the amount of money put into that particular kind of warbler.... not credible.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Beautifully written book which involves characters and how their lives entwine. A young, female Irish immigrant is placed with black slaves and basically raised by them until she grows into womanhood. At that point her life becomes uprooted and quite complicated. There is laughter and tears throughout the book. I couldn't put it down!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Best love story ever.<br />First book doesn't justify, you have to read all three books.<br />Each book gets better & better.
B00404YUG2|5.0|I bought this book based on very strong recommendations from friends and it does not disappoint.  Steven Pressfield perfectly captures and breaks down the daily battle of chasing your dream/goal.  This book has inspired me and I can't wait to read more from Pressfield!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Best love story ever.<br />First book doesn't justify, you have to read all three books.<br />Each book gets better & better.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie, \\"The Hunger Games\\" gives us much to think about. The performances are strong, the camera work is beautiful, the violence heavy but not gratuitois. My one thought is that reading the book before seeing the movie is helpful; the scope of the movie doesn't permit the inclusion of all the details in the book, so reading the book first gives clues that the movie can't include. The movie is, however, faithful to the spirit of the book. This is a strong story with a little too much realism for comfort. Don't miss the special featue, \\"Letter from the Rose Garden.\\"
B007ZXK08C|1.0|A disappointing read and denouement. I expected more than some Fatal Attraction sophistry. It gets you in  and then it drags and drags on. Then it chicken's out into a \\"literary\\" finish. Sad really - how good writers give into University Reconstructive critics from the avant-garde faculty.  They always approve of the type of books that people don't want to read, ie -dense allegory. Yuk
B008M34INW|5.0|Great movie. Lots of fun. I'm sure that if you have seen \\"Payback\\" and liked it.<br />Then you'll like this one. It's way out there but lots of laughs and plenty of action.<br />I don't give a crap one way or the other about Mel's politics. If I did, I wouldn't be<br />able to find any actors I could stand to watch. Face it Hollywood is full of nut jobs<br />bleeding heart liberals and socialists.<br />I liked the movie.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|this was a great book. I was in the mood for a book to make me laugh and bossy pants totally did.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|I know I saw this movie years ago, but it was like watching a new movie. Glad to see it.
B00846REIS|2.0|This is a cheap, poorly written copycat novel which you can tell was only penned to cash in on the Grey books with the same subject.  Reading either of them is a waste of time.  This is meant to lead the reader into buying the next book and spending more money to reach an apex of wasteful spending to read & reach something that never gets there.  The readers will be shaking their heads and saying is that all there is?  All of us who read this need to find something better to do. There are certainly better written books on this subject.
B007PYFMZM|5.0|I absolutely love this show and wish I could afford to buy all the episodes. Not many things make me laugh out loud, but this show (all of the Big Bang Theory) make me laugh and crack up!!  It is a real good feeling!
B006LSZECO|2.0|This one started out well but then got very slow. None of the characters were very likable. THe end was very disappointing.I do not recommend this book.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This book is not about romance / \\"weepy\\". I was absorbed by the very human insight in the quad's daily life - the constrictions and confinements. Brought some insight.
B008XG1X18|4.0|works better than in the browser for the kindle fire,  but sometimes has problems not opening and have to force close more than other apps. otherwise so nice to have this as an app.
B008M36ER0|2.0|2 hrs of my life I won't get back. It has been several weeks since watching it and I can't honestly remember anything about it. It was totally forgettable.
B008JH5CVS|2.0|not quite bad sci-fi, but not good either. a story told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.  acting mediocre. effects OK.  sorry i rented it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was simply awesome just as the previous two before it.  I'm looking forward to the next book from E.L.James.
B008F5YDRI|3.0|wife loved this movie. i thought it highly original, but flawed. acting is terrific.  plot a little odd, part of the charm i guess.<br />important for the wife - this movie is NOT about fishing.
B0038QN2AS|4.0|This book came highly reccommended, and it did an excellent job of living up to expectations - just when you think you understand what is going on with the Daemon, the scope of the Sobol's plan expands dramatically, and the Daemon becomes truly terrifying. Towards the end the story felt a little far-fetched, but the progression towards the conclusion was so natural that it still worked very well.
B000YJ6736|1.0|This was not a book- it is a short story that should have been part of a compilation. There was no pint to it in the end and you are only told what happened to one of the two main characters at the end of this depressing boring book. Please do not buy this book.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Amazing film for children of all ages. Has a great message too. Sit with your child when watching to convey the deeper message.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Read the book first. I think the movie compliments this great story. Jennifer Lawrence is at her best similiar to her character in Winters Bone.. I find myself a fan..
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love the app....when it works.  I have to open it and force close 3 or 4 times before it actually loads.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I waited to see this movie because I had read the series and did not want to be disappointed and I was not disappointed at all. This is a must see and if you are thinking about it just do it already.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Great movie with lots of action and drama. Looking forward to the second installment. Maybe a little graphic for the younger kids.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Very interesting read. This book didn't lose my interest as some second books in a series tend to do. Can't wait to read the third!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|ive beaten it once already!! so fun and random! I cant and wont stop. and even on second play through the missions and goals change. the dry humor of the loading screen still gets me. its that kind of attention to detail that makes this game perfect. Mr cuddles for president
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this caclulator its awesome. and it helps me a lot in my homework and also for. my little sister get it it helps a lot
B00881VLCE|4.0|Love the puzzles and levels of difficulty. The only thing I don't like is that the ads bar is right next to the puzzle pieces.  This means that nearly every time you pull for a new puzzle piece, you are thrown into an ad because they are too close. If I didn't spend so much time getting out of ads, I would have given it 5 stars. Otherwise, lots of fun!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|The all time best interpretation and adaptation of creatures in our world.  An exciting adventure and now one of my favorite books.  I can't wait to read it again and for the rest of the trilogy!
B008SA21N8|5.0|I love all of the characters and the chemistry between the characters. My only complaint is having to wait between the episodes.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I love this! Brilliant pop music we haven't seen the likes of in a very long time. It's refreshing to hear innovative music again.
B0088WFZQG|3.0|In this movie, the acting is not that great. However, there's not much of it as there's a TON of action. The action sequences completely make up for the bad acting, and they're made all the better when you realize, these guys did/do this in real life.
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games is a good movie. It really opens your eyes to what our Government could come too. Every time they take control of another area in our lives, we become more and more dependent on them. This movie shows what could be ahead for us (maybe not in this exact fashion) if we don't stop the Government from having such control over every part of our life.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Many people tell me that I need to read the book to appreciate the story.  Since I loved the movie, I can't wait to read the book.<br /><br />both thumbs up!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I first read TREASURE ISLAND when I was 10 years old, and have not read it since.  Now fifty years on I downloaded the novel on an impulse while on a recent vacation -- and was struck by the novel's narrative velocity, the gripping quality of the tale (even though it's now an oft-told variety of story that has been redone, revamped -- and amped up -- all the way up to and through the recent \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" film franchise).  The novel is artfully structured -- seamless, in fact -- as it moves briskly from one tense plot point to the next while consistently maintaining a very reasonable level of verismilitude.  (Once one gets past the somewhat outlandish premise that a couple 18th century English gentlemen with no experience of ships, sailing, or, moreover, piracy and criminality, would abruptly decide to launch an expedition to an uncharted island in search of loot stolen by a thug generally held to be the most savage pirate of them all.  But, that aside ... )  It was a pleasure to take a few hours and read this novel again.  Definitely fun, and striking to see how contemporary a feel in language and narrative drive that Stevenson maintained in a book published in 1883.  Of note is that this novel was originally published as a \\"story for boys.\\"  Indeed -- the only female character of even passing note is Jim Hawkins's mother, and she is left behind early on in the story.  These days we would want -- and need -- a female character or two.  But, again, looking at pure literary skill exhibited through economic prose and a plot design that delivers the goods, TREASURE ISLAND holds up well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games is a real page turner. Saw the movie then couldn't wait to read the book. The books are ALWAYS better and in more depth. After that, I couldn't wait to get my hands on the rest of the books. Great series and not predictable which adds to the excitement! A MUST read!
B008602KQI|3.0|I felt that this movie was over-rated by all the hype & press/media coverage. It didn't meet my expectations of \\"scientific wizardry\\" from the<br />contestant participants. Kinda disappointed.
B002DD67XG|5.0|This compilation is a great way to listen to music while working on your computer. In other words, nice background music. James Taylor's songs are soothing, retrospective, and easy-listening. There are no harsh sounds, obscene lyrics, or headache-inducing thumps. Just like a lullaby or a good friend, it's comforting and heartening.<br /><br />My faves are the popular \\"You've Got a Friend\\" and \\"Fire and Rain.\\"
B004Y03LQ2|5.0|i already have all of these songs from the original albums but i bought this for the live blayze baily era songs that bruce sings. i have new respect for \\"the clansman\\" and \\"sign of the cross\\" after this. good stuff here.

B008602KQI|5.0|i really enjoyed this movie and actually found myself rooting for our heroine, even though she is a completely unlikeable character.
B0088TG252|4.0|It was a good movie, but not as good as I expected.  Seemed like a rehash of many other movies.
B00271DNP4|5.0|I rented this movie from Amazon and was pleased with the quality of playback. Also the movie was excellent, one of my favorite HP movies.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how clever this book was. At first I thought it was written in an odd way, going back and forth between Nick and Amy, but then I couldn't wait to read about what each was thinking. It was funny too.
B0081336FO|5.0|Well thought out, original spins on stories of old.  Great casting, even better acting, and strong plots tie it all together for the perfect show to get people excited and interested about Sherlock Holmes.
B006LSZECO|1.0|sounded like the makings of a good story, it had 4 1/2 stars by a couple of hundred people on my Kindle ... sounded like a winner, could have been a winner if not for the tedious, boring, low level writing of the author...interesting story buy painful to read.<br />sounded like the makings of a good story, it had 4 1/2 stars by a couple of hundred people on my Kindle ... sounded like a winner, could have been a winner if not for the tedious, boring, low level writing of the author...interesting story but painful to read.
B006TF6WAM|3.0|The story line was sufficient to keep me haning in until the end although it was a struggle at times - it was a long journey and by the end I felt like I had walked it myself! The hiddent twist gave the story a sense of reality in the end though.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is a great movie.  By buying the dvd, we were able to watch it instantly on Amazon.  Enjoyed not having to wait for it to arrive.  Excellent experience.
B005BV0BA2|5.0|Not much to say....this is one of their best last record before they \\"changed\\". Great album. It's a must have if you are a Maiden fan.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|So excited to read a book that is more realstic about witchcraft and pokes fun at the cliche! Loved the the mix of creature lore, present day realities, and history. The characters are well developed and fun, even the fabulous house becomes a character in this book. There are parts that seem a little long but all the information imparted is necessary and they are balanced by parts that you're unable to stop reading. Can't wait for the weekend to dig in to book two!
B00866H7SS|5.0|Excellent book, as good if not better than fifty shades. Really well written, interesting story. Ends very abruptly but I guess that's just setting it up for the next book which I can't wait for! Overall, a great book, worth reading.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I am amazed at how closely the outline of the three books follows the same formula as the Twilight series.  Here we are on the last book and the main character, like Bella in Twilight, is married and pregnant.  She fights bad guys and wins, and overcomes the problems of a new marriage.  Don't get me wrong, it's fun to read, but it really isn't any better than any other sexy romance novel that I've read.  Bottom line.... Fifty Shades is an adult version of the Twilight series minus the vampires.
B008KMHFJY|4.0|A good read but I'm not sure why it's on the list to read after fifty shades as it has nothing in common at all. I wouldn't call it overally romantic and there is nothing erotic at all. It was however a good read and I did enjoy the book :)
B008602KQI|5.0|Amazon even made sure I had the digital copy at midnight so I could watch it on release!  Love the movie!!!!
B003V5CFV8|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable movie.  Kudos to the Coen Brothers for their take on Homer's Odyssey! This movie shows the viewer the pure fun of acting.  Loved it.
B007JRUCGO|1.0|I was very disappointed with Happy Feet 2.  The movie just didn't have the pazzazz and fun that the first one had. The environmental message was way too heavy and the fun aspect was way to light.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I recommend reading the trilogy...great love story. You must be mature and have an open mind when beginning to read the book. Don't prejudge based on what others are saying.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was amazing! I loved not being able to put it down. Perfectly matched sequel. I love me some Mr.Gray!!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|The music and sound effects are wonderful, and I like the way you can turn on or off several sounds.  I can layer a theme for myself and pretend I'm camping by a river, for instance.  Wonderful.  I wish it would play in the background tho, while I did other things on my tablet (like play solitaire or something, while listening).
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I pre-ordered this book for my Amazon Kindle Fire. It downloaded on time and is another great \\"Bones\\" book in the series about the exploits of Temperance Brennan. It is a book that instantly grabs your attention and hard to put down. A GREAT READ.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|I absolutely loved this book, it was hard for me to put it down. The story was enthralling, you can get lost in a world tied together by magic and fantastic engineering holding everything together. If I say too much I will end up giving away the mystery of the book, I would recommend it to anyone.

B0012GN404|5.0|For the past several decades,Janis Joplin's musical personality has become the stuff of legend. So much so that today people who were influenced by JANIS have influenced other artists themselves. It's difficult to believe that such an iconic figure (not legend and icon are actually opposit concepts) didn't start out in any hugely auspitious manner. A band called Big Brother & The Holding Company were a house band at this Frisco club called The Avalon Ballroom. They had the music down pat but were missing something: a standout lead singer. In comes manager Chet Helms with a singer whose career seemed stalled in Austin named Janis Joplin. Upon meeting,the musical and vocal minds just clicked and Big Brother & Janis were off the races.<br /><br />  This short album has a very intimate flavor about it. Songs such as \\"Bye,Bye Baby\\" and \\"Easy Rider\\" are rather downhome country-soul type numbers with Janis singing a bit straighter than normally associated with her explosive style. On \\"Intruder\\" and \\"Light Is Faster Than Sound\\" is where their sound really begins to form as you hear that pyschedelic blues style format emerge though still within the 2-3 minute format. \\"Call On Me\\" showcases Janis in full flower on a wonderfully reverb heavy souther soul ballad. \\"Woman Are Losers\\" with it's baudy,proto femanist blues licks is an example of Joplin's affinity for the music of people like Bessie Smith,whose hard living and singing ways Janis was most fascinated by. On \\"Down On Me\\" it's a hard driving soul rocker that Janis again works with all she's got whereas \\"Catepiller\\" mixes in some surf guitar licks in with a similar sound.<br /><br />  The album ends with the more abstract bluesy psychedelic of \\"All Is Lonliness\\". The bonus tracks \\"Coo Coo\\" and \\"The Last Time\\",both singles reflect the music of the band becoming less and less commercial while the alternate take of \\"Bye Bye Baby\\" is effective as it presents Joplin's lead with no double tracking as on the completed take. Every time I hear Janis Joplin's voice,it's very much like listening to the full range of human emotion expressed at once. Similar to what I get from listening to Otis Redding or James Brown. Even in soul music,it's a rare quality to get it all at once like that. But of all the Janis Joplin I heard? This might well be my favorite of her with Big Brothr. One reason is that the band is very aware of how playing cleanly can add to,rather than detract from,the musical surrealism of psychedelia. And it's the perfect contrast to Joplin's almost overpowering,whiskey soaked screech. A very important album for those exploring the music of the Summer Of Love.y time I hear Janis Joplin's voice,it's very much like listening to the full range of human emotion expressed at once. Similar to what I get from listening to Otis Redding or James Brown. Even in soul music,it's a rare quality to get it all at once like that. But of all the Janis Joplin I heard? This might well be my favorite of her with Big Brothr. One reason is that the band is very aware of how playing cleanly can add to,rather than detract from,the musical surrealism of psychedelia. And it's the perfect contrast to Joplin's almost overpowering,whiskey soaked screech. A very important album for those exploring the music of the Summer Of Love.
B008MEM24S|5.0|It is a fun game. It is challenging and my daughter loves it. She has beaten the game but she still plays it.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I LOVE this app but the fact that it keeps deleting the extra puzzles I have picked (and even paid for)  really ruins it for me. If it worked well,  it would be in my top two favorite apps.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was a great book that kept you hooked the entire series with characters to die for!  Every woman could use their very own Christian Gray.
B002M5E2DW|1.0|The book the secret never came to my address (16407 sapphire place, weston florida, 33331). Very good that you write me this message, to comunicate that i never receive my book the secret.

B008602KQI|5.0|This Movie IS a Great one, My Ten Year old and I can watch it and its enjoyable. Please note if you read the book you will be somewhat disappointed in the movie, which goes for any movie that is made based off a book. They did a good job though, and my little girl enjoyed it. Can't wait for the second one to come out, I heard it was a little bloodier.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Great fun for all in the family.  Great colors, patterns and details.  Would like more puzzles like this to play against my family.
0812993292|4.0|When Harold Fry gets a letter from an old friend who's dying of cancer, he decides in a leap of faith to take a pilgrimage across England to \\"save\\" her. Along the way, he meets many interesting characters and learns to listen to their troubles. He also has time to reminisce about his past...some happy memories, but mostly memories of things he should have done better. This is a bitter-sweet story with deep characters and a good message. The type of person who would love this book is sentimental, and loves reminiscent stories about past mistakes and new beginnings.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a very special book.  It reminds all of us what is important. This is a quick read that brings cheers, tears and smiles.  I have now purchased for a dear friend who always goes out of her way to do the right thing!  Pass it on...
0807014273|5.0|In the first half of this fascinating little book, Frankl describes his years in the concentration camps (including Auschwitz) with the purpose of analyzing the behavior of people in extreme situations. He admits that someone who wasn't there can't give a very detailed or personal account, but a person who WAS there can't give a detached account because they were emotionally involved. I think he did an excellent job of viewing the situation with detachment, considering the situation. This was a really interesting little memoir. The second half of the book introduces his theory of psychoanalysis: logotherapy. Logotherapy is focused on man's search for meaning; in contrast to Freudian theory focusing on man's search for pleasure and Adlerian theory focusing on man's search for power. I think Logotherapy is the most sensible form of psychotherapy I've ever heard of. How can I argue that our happiness depends on our perceiving our own purpose? I admit I felt a little skepticism when he kept bringing up examples of how he'd \\"cured\\" someone after only one session--he must have been a particularly clever person to manage that so often.  But that aside, I think the technique of finding meaning in a patient's life is rather useful.
B006MPKAOI|5.0|This was possibly the best book I've read in a long time. So good I couldn't put it down, even though at times it was very confronting.
B008602KQI|5.0|I was very happy with buying Hunger games after watching it to see what many were talking about. And because I am a fan of Josh Hutcherson<br /> I felt like I was part of the action as the game was being played. I would have to say this movie is well worth buying and watching for the unendless<br />  action in it. All the actors did a amazing job with the parts.
B008602KQI|5.0|A dark little movie of epic proportions. The actors, some relative unknowns, portray the quirky characters beautifully. Definitely shocks but never desensitizes the viewer to a world gone mad.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love the interchangeable sounds. It is lovely to sleep to. I can change it to suit my moods. And it's a portable way to reduce stress.<br />I like how it allows one to choose either soothing or uptempo sounds depending on what type of destressing or focusing that you are needing at the time.  I especially love that it has a timer so you can set it and fall asleep and not worry about your phone battery running down!!!
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|Very inspirational and devistating wonderful. This dvd has alot of good to great actors and is a must have dvd for collection.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was amazing...there was twist upon twist and just when you thought you had it figured out there was another twist.<br />now I want to read more.
B003ZJ70W4|3.0|I love Sex In The City as much as the next girl, but this installment jumped the shark for me... it was fun, and silly... but not much else...lol.  And they are all looking a little long in the tooth... but then again, so am I!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I really loved this book! Follett made history come to life! I was fascinated by his descriptions of early 20th-century Europe.  I felt like I was there, a fly on the wall!  There was young Billy the Welsh coal miner on his first day at work at age 13.  Everything was personalized so I really felt the misery of the mine workers and the poor little ponies who never again saw the light of day, and of WWI and the callousness and stupidity of the British officers who were so sure they knew what they were doing, Russians in their misery reaching out to Lenin.  All the characters are fleshed out in depth, including heads of state.  I didn't even notice that the book is long (1000 pages!) since I read it on my Kindle so I didn't have to heft a big tome.  I was particularly interested in the sequences that began WWI.  The scope of the book is epic, and it deserves every one of its 1000 pages.  I can't wait to read Winter of the World!
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|Fantastic coming of age story, should be a must for teenagers!!  Great life lessons of humanity. Very well done. Love it!
B001230JXC|5.0|YES!  In this case it was worth it!  The quality on this remaster was definitely worth it.  This is such a classic album for me and I was glad to see it get the modern sonic touch!
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Nice movie,  alot of action, but more of a good plot.  Would love to see the follow ups to the books.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I find Fifty Shades poorly written, as if for a teenager instead of any mature adult. The constant \\"Hmm\\" and reference to some inner self is ridiculous. All in all, I'm sorry I wasted my money on this trilogy. Can't make myself finish the second book, probably will never read the third. Boring.......
B000PHN4HE|4.0|This older film still has relevance in today's world.  It is a romantic comedy that is as enjoyable today as it was when it first came out.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is a wonderful movie, I would highly recommend it to others. Only one thing, I thought I was getting the DVD / Blu-Ray combo but it was only Blu-Ray. I would bet that was my mistake tho... It is still a must have
B008OOYALE|4.0|My two granddaugthers plays on their mother's Kindle Fire and begged me to buy on mine so they could each play the together at once without waiting for their turns. They love it!
B008CJ0KI8|4.0|I'm not really into R&B but when I read about his tumblr post, I got a chance to find out just how impressive this guys career has been. He's been known as a talented producer for quite sometime in the music industry working with Beyonce, Kanye West, and Jay-Z. His voice is good but for me the production of the music is just top notch. I like how he kind of combines some electronic music and R&B into his music. I'm pretty sure this guy is bound to have a long career after this great debut album.<br /><br />My favorite songs of the album are: Pyramids, Lost, Rich Kids, Bad Religion.<br /><br />I like that his songs aren't just about dancing and having fun but also cover some more important issues in his personal life. He's a gifted song writer / singer who is able to be vulnerable and sincere. He shows that there is great talent from people in their twenties who will have a good impact in the music industry.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|VERY HANDY APP. KEEPS ME FROM GETTING CAUGHT WITH A BATTERY THAT IS DEAD WHEN I DON'T HAVE THE CHARGER WITH ME.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|This season is great and will not disappoint Vampire Diaries fans! I am a new viewer, but this season was the most exciting yet. You can't stop watching and the ending is so exciting! I can't wait for season 4! Thank you Amazon for making it available online!
B00005K3NR|5.0|When you were in high school, were you one of the \\"unpopular\\" students? Were you not one of the \\"popular\\" students? Did the popular crowd make fun of you, teased you, harass you, bully you? Did you lie awake at night, dreaming of ways to get back at them? If the answer to any of these answers were \\"yes\\" this movie is for you.<br /><br />Carrie has been described as a movie about teenage angst. In reality it goes much deeper and is a revealing look at America in the mid-70s. A sub plot to Carrie is the tortured relationship she has with her mother, a crazed, religious fanatic, who ironically correctly predicts that Carrie should not associate with her peers and should instead stay cloistered at home reading the Bible. The current culture clash is evident in this movie, first with Carrie and her mother and then in the meeting of Carrie's mother with another mother of one of the student's at school, played by Amy Irvine's real life mother. While, Stephen King has commented, there are some dated elements to the movie, it is, as he also adds, still a good movie.<br /><br />The movie demonstrates what everyone knows who went through high school: Teenagers can be mean, just plain mean. Because Carrie deals with issues that will never go away as long as there are teenagers, it holds up remarkably well.
034580404X|5.0|I found the books well writtten. Also they were hard to put down once I started reading them. They were written very well and the story flowed flawlessly.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game rocks<br />: )it is the best game ever!!!!!!!!!! it is fun for big and small kids its awesome
B006LSZECO|5.0|Brilliantly done; exciting plot twists. Would not have guessed I'd be rooting for such a despicable character. First Gillian Flynn novel I've read and I'm now a fan!!
B002NQ08II|5.0|This is my favorite movie of alllll time. If you havent seen it you are seriously missing out. This is a must watch movie!!!
B000IEXVCC|5.0|Amazing movie! Everyone should watch. Definitely messes with your mind and love it!!! One of the best movies I have seen in a Lon time and I highly recommend it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book along with the first two.  I hated that it skipped so much in the end and really wish it would have kept going.  I could read about Christina and Ana Grey FOREVER!!  Didn't think I would have ever liked this type of book but was so surprised when I could not put it down.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I enjoyed this sequel.  Great camera work, comedy and plot.  Highly recommend if you liked the first.  Robert Downey Jr. was great for this part.  He killed it!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Very good read.  The characters mature in their love and respect for each other.  Wished these books had been around many years ago. They opened my mind in many areas.  Enjoyed tremendously.
B0084RSYEK|3.0|I like Eddie Murphy movies, so I enjoyed this film.  It's definitely not his best, but it's entertaining.  It is worth watching, but not Oscar worthy material by any means.  I enjoyed watching it once, but it is not one I would want to watch a second time like Beverly Hills Cop (actually I've seen that one several times!)  Eddie has kinda lost a lot of the edginess he used to have in the 80's and 90's and that is what made him Eddie Murphy and me love his films.  This movie had it's \\"moments\\" and I enjoyed it on a dead summer night whilst the reality shows plagued us.
B000I8G5C6|5.0|HITCH is a great movie. I love Will Smith, but Kevin James steals the show!! What fun to watch these two as they interact. How they ever got this movie done without losing it every scene is beyond me. A MUST WATCH!
B0067H9W72|5.0|This show is a beast!  Love it!  I can't stand zombie movies at all and the only reason I tuned into this show is that is was being filmed near my hometown.  Oh man, one view and I was a \\"dead head\\" in the newest sense of the word.  Can't wait for the third season.  The cliffhanger from season two is a \\"throw a brick at your tv set\\" moment because your so angry it's over for four months!  If you haven't seen this series watch the first six episodes for free online...You'll want to buy season 2 after that, I guarantee it.
B005721W9O|5.0|This is a super fun movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family.  I have seen this many times and I still fall over laughing, just a GREAT film!<br /><br />thx
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I haven't read a book for a while and once I started, I couldn't put it down. I may have to read it again.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I have not had a chance to read it yet.  Once I read it I will write my review then.  I gave it a 3 based on the good reviews I received from my friends who read it. [[ASIN:030758836X Gone Girl: A Novel]]
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie, little differences from the book, but well done!  Some stand out characters and great concepts.  May not be young kid friendly due to violence.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a terrific book - with a few gasps and surprises. The setting was detailed without being burdensome. I loved the who-done-it aspect.  The passion and sacrifices of parents was believable and heart-wrenching. I couldn't put it down.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Not a bad movie, but i am definately glad I only rented it for $1.99 instead of dishing out $20 bucks to see it at the movies.
B008602KQI|5.0|One of the best movies I have watched for awhile. Have purchased the books on Kindle can't wait to read an see what happens to Katniss, Peta and Gabe.
B003IWRE3I|5.0|Didn't know what to expect but was totally satisfied with this post-apocalyptic suspense ride.  Would see over and over and highly recommend!
B0027P2ZWC|5.0|This anniversary concert is spectacular. I own the old VHS, but no longer have a VHS player, so I purchased the album and can now listen on both my computer and my Kindle Fire.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I just finished reading this book, even working full time and going to college I finished it in less than 48 hours.  The story moves along nicely, and unlike what the goverment says, there is no classified information in this book.
B0024FAR5M|1.0|I was excited to received it in the mail so quickly.We started watching disc one and it paused many times.I tried another dvd player and it was the same.Out of all the discs there was only one that played without a problem...I have never had a problem before.It makes me hesitant to buy used discs in the future.
B002DD67XG|4.0|I really loved the cd and my co-workers and I had James Taylor week and played this cd on repeat and it never got old. But, the only reason i did not give it a 5 star rating is because of song steamroller, which had cursing in it and I had to delete it off of the playlist for obvious reasons. But, over all I loved the music download.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I read this novel the week my husband retired -- so glad I did.  Harold's journey gave him the opportunity to examine his life, while his absence gave his wife the same chance.  Nice to know that long-held prejudices and beliefs can be shaken loose and a new beginning earned.  I've been recommending the book to everyone I know!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good book, writer is gifted but don't think the characters are realistic.  The story grabbed me and its comparison to Hitchcock was accurate. Major flaw is the implausibility that a person could actually react the way a main character did.
B0073XV2W2|4.0|Did not necessarily understand all the technical sides of the story; but it was a good read! My guess is that much of the survelience part of this story is in place today.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The beginning of this story was a little slow to start, and there were a lot of details left to make you wonder what the heck was going on.  As the story progressed, however, things got moving, and kept me hanging on.  But then....it just ended.  It was like the author either lost interest in the project or he intended on adding another volume.  There is still a lot of story left for these characters.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|It's different than any of the other movies they have had out lately. I thought I wasn't going to like it but I enjoyed if very much.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|This is the 4th book in the series. I have really enjoyed all of them and have the next one already in my kindle ready to go! I found this book to be a little confusing and hard to follow. I missed my old friends from the previous books, but the surprises kept coming and I was surprised!  I am looking forward to this book because according to the author all my old friends will be back. Can't wait for the next episodes on HBO.
0061801313|5.0|I just started this series and i love it, the price from amazon is awesome. I found the single books in store for 3x the cost. Can't wait to order the rest from here.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I began reading the series due to the television show and I'm very glad I did due to the changes between the two.  While they both have the same characters and general plot I found I had more compassion for certain characters than I did in the show which has made the story better for me.
B0021QO3ZE|5.0|Some of George Benson's finest.  Whenever I listen to \\"Give me the Night,\\" it just takes me back to a place and time when life was so simple and fun.  :) Totally recommend it!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I'm really glad to have this app on my Kindle Fire but it takes forever to load and isn't easiest to get to the link.
B004W25KKW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed following Joshua through his year or so of memory training and particularly the research he did behind the origin of memory. I liked how he put this into context in the modern day and never stopped asking the question as to whether we as a modern population with near infinite access to 'external memories' could benefit from learning these memory techniques which had been lost over generations but now are more advanced than ever but used by very little. I found his writing so thought provoking Ive also noted down further reading on the topic from his thorough list of references.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|All three books were very good. Fast paced action that kept your attention. I had a lot of difficulty putting it down. I highly recommend the books.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|This series was recommended to me by an author of fantasy tales whose opinion I trust and I wasn't disappointed.  From the beginning in Book 1, Mr Martin constructed characters, locations and histories that drew me right into the story.  I bought the third book before I had finished the this one so that I didn't have to suffer any delay. A very satisfying read.  Brilliant.
B005898CFI|5.0|i saw this movie as a teenager and fell in love every other John Wanye movie had western. so i wasnt interested but my aunt insisted. Iam so glad she did!
B003B02O7I|5.0|The Testament is a superbly woven story; John Grisham outdid even himself on this one![[ASIN:B0083D4MZU With God In His Hip Pocket]]
B008GX2YX4|5.0|Centipede Hz is a brilliant album. It is definitely a much harder to swallow record than some of their past records, more specifically Merriweather Post Pavillion, but once you can really wrap your head around the concept of this record, it's absolute genius. As opposed to Merriweather, which was pure Panda Bear in the spotlight, this record has Avey Tare and Geologist both making very notable contributions in songwriting and electronic noise respectively.<br /><br />\\"Today's Supernatural\\" is a psychedelic rock masterpiece, while \\"Moonjock\\" almost feels like a wild rollercoaster. Panda Bear also is present with two tracks, the poppy \\"Rosie Oh\\" and the majestic \\"New Town Burnout,\\" but his major contribution is in his return to the drum kit, delivering some fantastic rhythms throughout the record. Deakin also makes his major songwriting debut in the song \\"Wide Eyed,\\" a beautiful, almost meditative jam. Last, but not least, the dark \\"Monkey Riches\\" has some utterly fantastic vocals from Avey, and closer \\"Amanita\\" finishes the album with a bang.<br /><br />Centipede Hz takes a little to get used to, especially after the electro-pop anomaly that was Merriweather. However, it sees the band fusing some of those pop songwriting styles with their experimental and noisy past, delivering a wild and fantastic listening experience.
B000UZNSWM|4.0|The Korean War is a forgotten war for most Americans as little time is devoted to it in public school classrooms. It was obvious by the number of footnotes that much research was done before the text was written. I was in preschool when this was making headlines so my opinion of MacArthur was partially influenced by the author who didn't seem to like him. There were so many references to size of troop groups that I had to make a note card to keep up with how many men were actually involved in combat action. It was easy to sense the frustration experienced by various officers as they tried to do a good job & minimize loss of life when the higher ups were poorly informed, away from the area & involved in their own agendas.According to this book, the Korean War was a prelude to the Vietnam War as neither of them had an actual winner.
B00846REIS|5.0|Just read this book in 2 days, cant wait till the next one comes out. I've already preordered it even. Even though it's no 50 Shades I still really enjoyed it.
B005IT0V8O|4.0|This is a great book to have on hand and a great reference book. A co-worker has this book on his desk and I have the kindle version.
B007SGM084|5.0|A friend gave me her books to read... well needless to say I bought a Kindle solely with the intent to purchase this series and support the author.  It's totally worth the $.  They were the best I've read by far....and since this I've ready 12 other books in the Erotic/BDSM section.<br /><br />Let me just tell you I've been married for 12 years and sex was just sex.  We were both each others firsts and we were boring... But thanks to this Trilogy I/we have a whole new light on the subject! There's so much more passing and fire there now... it's totally changed my view on the bedroom.  And it's also inspired me to lose weight to try some of the diff things/positions mentioned in here.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|From the moment I purchased and it was downloaded to my Kindle App, I had a hard time putting this book down. This is the first book written by a Navy SEAL which I have read, and I will admit I was drawn by the possibility that this book would not be released and the \\"get it while you can\\" mentality. I was torn whether I was going to actually buy and read the book; in the end the decision to buy and read won out.<br /><br />The story captured my attention with captivating insight into community of America's greatest operators. I did not feel like the author was trying to capture the spotlight, but to truley tell the story behind of the guys behind the headline from his prespective.<br /><br />Though I am sure I would not recognize \\"SECRET\\" information even if I read it, the book did not seem to divulge any information that was not already out, and in fact some details highly discussed and speculated about by the media in regards to the mission were not mentioned. To me that spoke the the fact that yes, there could have been some whizz-bang gear to talk about, but that was not the point of this book.
B008DW6VOQ|2.0|Needs to take out the chart column on market view. It makes it very slow to load.<br /><br />Further, the screen orientation is changed even when the screen is locked.
B006Y5EMHM|5.0|THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT SERIES I CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 2 ALTHOUGH THERESA REBECK WON'T BE THERE I HOPE THIS DOESN'T CAUSE IT DAMAGE IT WAS SOOO GREAT.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|THe Hunger Games movie is one that you must see this year.  If you have not yet bought the DVD either in Regular DVD or Blu-ray I would highly recommend it. My son watched the movie and got so inspired that he wanted me to buy the book for him to read.  He is 10 years old.  Get the movie.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I thought it was quite intriguing, it draws you in, and you want to find out what happens to these characters, it was well written and quite a different story from what I've ever read before.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|Very informative look at the many dimensions of a guy known mostly for his music. As well as I thought I knew his career, this filled in the blanks perfectly. Great Flick !!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It is neat app. It is very helpful to know the usage of variety apps as well as estimate duration. Haven't encounter any problems yet.
B008602KQI|5.0|Hunger Games is a provocative view of a world that is both fascinating and horrifying.  One in which the children pay the terrible price for the sins of their parents.  This movie is not for the faint of heart but is an intriguing look into a future.
B008ASLK8A|2.0|I wasn't too crazy about this movie.  It really has a slow start and besides a few comedy parts I thought it was rather boring.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|The picture quality was amazing, I felt like I was at the movies. Great movie, had to buy it so I can watch it over and over. Seen it three times since purchasing. Love amazon instant videos, it's so convenient.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This album far exceeded my expectations. The energy and lyricism of the music is a throwback to their earlier days, while the musicianship, style, and \\"modernness\\" continues to compound.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Not what I expected but story was somewhat compelling.  Ana a very strong personality to change a man with his background.  Mr. Grey should continue to keep Ana around.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|I found this to be an intriguing yet easy read.  It was well written and gave  rounded characterisation.  The plot moved along steadily in a gentle non-dramatic sort of way and yet, I find myself thinking about it during the day which to me, is always a sign of good literature.
B008602KQI|4.0|Excellent start to the Hunger Game Series.  Cast was strong, story line flowed well.  Never read books, but enjoyed the movie and look forward to next in series.
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved it!! I especially love the digital copy, now I have it on my iPhone and Mac..whole family loves the movie and books. It arrived promptly and in great shape.
B004NS710C|4.0|Edge of your seat action.  Acting was good and the story line was good including the personal lives of the characters.
B0037VNX44|4.0|If you can appreciate the art of it, then you will love this movie. Tom Hardy shows how versatile an actor he is. You almost forget its him. His accent can be a little hard to understand, but you still understand. Be prepared for some awkward nudity.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I stayed up far later than I intended to finishing this off.  The characters were well developed, the motivations plausible, the story was always lively.  There were a couple patches of implausibility, but a riveting read with a satisfying ending - though not the one many would have anticipated.
B00846REIS|1.0|This is a total ripoff of FIFTY SHADES OF GREY.  It has absolutely no originality.  If I were E L James I would be furious.  If I could have given it 0 stars I would have
B006LSZECO|2.0|Really liked the book.  I was engaged and couldn't wait to get back to it each night.  The ending however was a complete disappointment.  I couldn't believe the lack of creativity after such a complex story.  I wouldn't recommend this book.  I would however recommend her book Dark Places - VERY good book!  So, she's a great author, just fell very flat at the end of this book.
B008N1LL42|3.0|Decent special effects, no character depth or development beyond the obvious. There is no explanation of why the aliens came, terrible use of good actors, the best performance was the amputee.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game! my son will watch and tell me what to cook! its cute:)  add me! storm8: cagirl2388
B008IYR2BA|3.0|Well it was inevitable, I knew Dexter would begin to lose its allure, and this season has begun to show the undoing and eventual demise of Dexter,(You knew it was going to happen). All the shows loose character ends are beginning to knot and I can see the whole Miami Metro dept. Capt on down get arrested, demoted, killed, etc. Hard act to follow the riveting \\"Trinity\\" killer season. And yet the NEW season begins again. Be good. Be very, very good, or Dex will get you!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|My adult children recommended this book and so I read it to have something in common to discuss with them.  I really enjoyed it and thought the writing was amazing.  I highly recommend it.
B001A3CP5Y|5.0|Great to hear these great musicians again. I had cd when it first came out and lost it. Take me back in time. George Harrison, Roy Orbison sound great .
B003LXSY60|5.0|The Black Keys' \\"Brothers\\" is definitely their best able to that point, thought \\"El Camino\\" is probably better. The quality of their albums has been constantly improving on greatness. However, for those fans who like the classic blues feel over the pop-infused, electronic blues of \\"El Camino,\\" \\"Brothers\\" sticks to those roots.
B0084B5TK8|2.0|Just not my cup of tea.  The description of the land and area was masterful but still not my kind of book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book! I think it took 2 days to read it,then I read it again!! Can't wait to get fifty shades darker.
B00632HWOG|4.0|The App is very useful to use on Smart Phones for Yahoo Mail.  When I want to use the Yahoo Mail on my phone, I have a hard time to access it from browser.  When I found this App, all problems were solved!
B004SBB0LU|5.0|This box set is a perfect jewel for any lover of Queen. The songs remain as relevant now as they were then. The remastering only adds to the genius that is Queen. The addition of rare songs as well as those we've loved all these years make this a must have for any die-hard Queen fan.<br />Yesterday was Freddie's 66th birthday. It's tragic that he's been gone so long and that the magic of seeing the four original band members live will never happen again. But it's comforting to know that the magic lives on in these recordings.<br />Thank you to Freddie, Brian, Roger, and the reclusive John, for the lifetime of music and memories you have given me.<br />Long live Freddie. Long live Queen.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I learned about Pinterest about a month ago.  As an educator, I have found countless resources at either affordable price, but mostly free.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|If you have read the Red Rose, the White Rose and Lady of the Rivers you'll appreciate the Kingmaker's daughter even more.<br />However no need to have read the other books to understand this one, just as the other books, its a different point of view of the story of the cousin's war -Anne's point of view- and gives it the missing peices or the continuity of the other books. It is another fabulously written piece.<br />I strongly recommend it.
B004T32SOK|5.0|I just love this app. When you're dealing with constantly having to do master resets on your phone,the Box really comes in hand so your important files get saved.
B008A1NSTG|5.0|The fact that this was based on a true story made the movie for me.  Very uplifting as it portrays peoples' willingness to help animals as we all should.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I haven't seen the t.v. version, but decided to read the books to see what all the talk was about. It sucks you in and deals out bite-sized pieces of the story. Each chapter takes up the continuing story line of an individual character. In that way it teases, so that you have to keep reading to figure out what happens next. My housework is definitely suffering as a result. Would definitely recommend this series!
B005MR38AA|4.0|Lots of action, sex and violence. Not for the faint of heart or young children. You've already heard of the glory of Rome. This shows the dark side of the Roman empire and how slaves were treated. Good for some mindless entertainment when you want to see lots of action.
B0013FSXT6|3.0|Go to YouTube and watch one of the countless videos decoding this movie. It's apparently some kind of coded message about the Illuminati - although I'm not sure they actually exist. It's fascinating to see the film's ideas and images analyzed through that lens. Just as The Shining is best viewed as Kubrick hinting about his involvement in the possibly staged moon landing and how that affected his relationship with his wife and children.
B005O745TG|3.0|Love HIMYM and this episode was great but this Amazon video on demand playback starts several seconds into the episode, and there's no way to rewind back to the beginning! Amazon needs to work on their video quality.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|Great movie adaptation from the comics.  Casting was pretty much dead on and the changes that were made work!!  Picture quality on the blu-ray is spectacular.  Nice special features and the commentary from MARV is excellent.
0441013597|5.0|Dune is, IMO, the best, SF books of all time. I have now read this four or five times and I can see where so many other authors have borrowed from the work of Frank Herbert. The entire series is good, but the first one was a masterpiece.<br /><br />Hebert is one of the few authors who can do it all, and do it remarkably well. He is a storyteller supreme, keeping you on the edge of your seat, poised to turn pages the instant the last word is read. He is an intricate plotter, creating mastermind plots that reel you in, twist you around and keep you wondering what is coming next. His character development is incomparable. Every one of his \\"cast of thousands\\" is deep and consistent and interesting. Whether you hate them or love them, there is no denying that they are well developed. The fact that you will both hate and love them is proof. He digs deeply into science to construct the planet and its ecosystem, and he delves even deeper into religion for some of the races of people and their beliefs. I have only read a few books as purely satisfying as Dune, and it's one I will keep coming back to.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Even though I downloaded the story a month or so ago I have just begun to read it. I have to say, this is the BEST Si-Fi story I have read in years. I have been reading Science Fiction since I was a kid. This is the first time in years that I can say, \\"This book is hard to put down.\\" After two evenings I am nearing the end of the first book of the trilogy. I haven't read a book this fast in 40 years. The price was fantastic and it's great to read it on the knidle. Cudos to the Author and to Amazon. Maybe when I finish the book I can watch the movie. I always try to read the books first....
B007SGM084|5.0|All three of these books kept me on the edge of my seat and left me wanting more... Really wish she would come out with another book so we can see how their lives turn out!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The story was clever, and I liked the characters, but the ending was such a let down! My pet peeve is writers who don't know how to resolve their story, so they just STOP it!It makes me feel cheated out of the time I spent reading!
B005LLSNNE|4.0|Great season kept me wondering what would happen next!!  This season really had so much going on and the twist and turns it took just surprised me every show.
B003MX5P20|3.0|I listened to this album on Spotify today for free and here's what I think. The slower songs are generally good and definitely are of higher quality than the faster-paced English-spoken tracks. While the upbeat songs generally have an empty, party mode vibe going on to them and not much else, the ballads slow things down and offer more to digest. Even though I don't understand many Spanish words, I still preferred the arrangements and especially the vocals where Enrique took his time to please and seduce your ears. \\"Heartbeat\\" is the best faster song here featuring a female singer and songs like \\"I Like It\\" with its unpleasant vocals and \\"Dirty Dancer\\" offer up something to dance to but seem more fillerish than anything. I bet it didn't take much time to record these tracks at all.<br /><br />Overall, I'm not interested in buying this album. But with that said it doesn't make for a bad listen. The ballads make up more of the album and the speedier-tempoed songs take a backseat to them. I wouldn't mind hearing it again but not worthy of a purchase in my eyes. Buy the songs you like.<br /><br />3.5 stars.
B00846REIS|3.0|As I got further along in this book, I realised how similar it was to 50 Shades. I mean, really similar, so much so, that as I was reading it, I thought it was a 'Shades' knock-off.<br /><br />Disappointed....
B004POVBRS|1.0|Well I'm sure it's obvious by now that I don't like season 3, but THIS episode is the most boring of all.  There's nothing new here that we didn't already know or could guess.  I suppose they can't all be golden, but this one is definitely a throw away and it wouldn't be missed whatsoever.  How many ways can I say boring?? Bummer, characterless, cloying, colorless, commonplace, dead, drab, drag, drudging, dull, flat, ho-hum, humdrum, insipid, interminable, irksome, lifeless, monotonous, moth-eaten, mundane, nothing, nowhere, platitudinous, plebeian, prosaic, repetitious, routine, spiritless, stale, stereotyped, stodgy, stuffy, stupid, tedious, threadbare, tiresome, tiring, trite, unexciting, uninteresting, unvaried, vapid, wearisome.<br /><br />All those words ALMOST describe this ridiculous episode.
B00846REIS|3.0|This book was ok, reminds me of Fifty Shades of Gray.  I have preordered the next book just because I want to know how it ends.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Very good movie that keeps you entertained,, but targeted at a younger audience.  I would watch it again.  The scenery and action was great.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The movie was packaged nicely and I received it within a few days. I used the price checker app and it worked great also.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was the first book I have ever read by Jamie McGuire and loved every bit of it!!  She had me hooked from the beginning and left me wanting even more at the end!!<br /><br />Travis and Abby are so creatively written.  Jamie does an excellent job with the plot and adding in the twists and turns at practically every page!  This book will have you at the edge of your seat the entire time!!!<br /><br />As one reviewer put it - BUY IT! DEVOUR IT!  LOVE IT!! - can't say it any better!<br /><br />I can not wait to read this from Travis' POV in the next book, Walking Disaster.
B008578PRK|2.0|Totally on unfinished ending, making the whole story a bit pointless, can't really ever know the back story since it is fiction.
B0049VZ222|5.0|This may be a series based on a zombie apocolypse, but it is much more than just that. The character development is excellent - every time someone is lost or in peril, you hold your breath hoping that they will make it through in one piece. Human interaction is thoroughly explored and the good, bad and ugly are exposed. Can't wait to buy and watch season 2.
B0081KTI0E|4.0|I really liked this movie.Can't say it was scary, but it did make me jump a few times. I wasn't too crazy about the ending but my friend liked it.
B003QSIM30|5.0|Great family movie, fun songs, well developed characters and fun plot line. Cried like a baby! Worth a second watch.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I just wanted to give my rating before I forget. I'm only about 12 levels in but it has grabbed me and won't let go.
B001661RC2|5.0|Been a big fan of the Black Keys for the last few years and this album is one of my favorites.  They are a great group.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|But you have to read it first, and nothing happens in the first half of the book. The second half takes place in Canada, so the author has  figured that out,too!  We had a very good book club discussion on the book.
B003O86FMW|3.0|The book followed the first nicely, it was well written, and unpredictable.  I enjoyed the series, and I am an adult.  I will read additional Suzanne Collins books, and recommend the Hunger Games series to others.
0465022227|5.0|I'm a Post-doc starting my career search and every section of this book is helpful, with honest, thoughtful advice. You can skip around the different chapters to read the most applicable sections first.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I saw the movie first and that made me want to read the true story of this wonderful horse.  I liked the book even better than the movie (and the movie was great).  It is a very moving story of the love of a young man for his horse as well as the story of a very brave horse and what he went through in the war.
B001MSMUH0|5.0|Filled with hope and wild expectations! This book makes you w ant to find your niche! I could not put it down.
B005HSGB6W|5.0|This story is very old and very good. The author really knows how to put you in Alex (The main character) foots, and tell you his story.<br />It can be a little bit confusing when first reading nasdat, but it's worth it.<br />Alex is a young gang leader, which after a few events, will see how all the evil he done to this world, somehow goes back to him, after a shocking treatment.<br />The book is full of ultraviolence and gross scene descriptions, so you must see the real meaning of the message Burgess is trying to transmit.
B00153ZC8Q|5.0|One of the best movies with Arnold as a bad guy. This is a must see movie and really enjoyable to watch.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|this cd dvd combo is what i wanted after hearing adele 21 adele live at the royal albert hall dvd is unedited and a great feel concert experance makes you feel as if you were really there. i loved it highly recommend
B005DD7TI0|5.0|Movies like this make you suspend your rational thinking and just go with it.  Who wouldn't want to take the pill, for a chance to achieve all your dreams.  Maybe that's the rub, we aren't supposed to.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Really interesting ideas, a great antidote to \\"total involvement mothering\\" I see frequently.  I would really take the advice from this book; let's not lose our heads with the children.
B008CP93S0|3.0|I thought it was okay. it was more stupid humor and some crude humor but i have seen these actors In better movies. worth a watch if ur really looking for something to watch but ur not missing much if ya miss it all together.
B006FE83U4|5.0|The copy that I purchased was in very good shape-like new.  We enjoyed the movie this time as much as we did the first time we saw it.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Excellent drama with fast paced , witty format. The budding relationship between Watson and Sherlock allows the fewer to see how the two men grow to be close friends.
B00571F26Y|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the most eye-opening books about wheat whether you are a person dieting or just health conscious.  I was not only surprised but amazed to learn how wheat itself has been modified over the years with no input or analysis from the FDA and the harm it can do to today's populations.  If you have ailments, diseases or are just health conscious, this should be a must-read book.
B005IQZB14|4.0|this was a great read. i learned alot about the area's she treked through and what it took to do it.
B008602KQI|3.0|The movie was well done for what it was, but my son and grandson asked questions about what and why. As luck would have it I read the trilogy and could answer all their quesitons, they were impressed. Thank you for helping expand my families interest in reading.
034580404X|2.0|THe Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy turned out to be a huge disappointment.  This could have been written by a first year college student, and a \\"C\\" student at that.  The author showed no imagination, creating one sex scene that simply repeated itself over and over again, as if caught in a loop from which she couldn't escape.  Grey is an appropriate  description of these novels for they lacked any color in language and characters.  I grew so tired of all the \\"moaning\\".  Didn't the author have access to a thesaurus?  The author's  characters failed to develop in any way that was significant beyond the sophomoric level at which they were introduced in Book One, Chapter One.  As erotic novels for mature audiences these books failed miserably providing nothing beyond what every romance novel ever printed has given its readers.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|I love this band but a lot of their past work has been hit and miss. I have to say, though, this album completely ROCKS from beginning to end! Great job, Maria and Co.!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Love, Love Love this book.  Extremely well written.  Love the historical aspects in the story, informative but not boring.  It's got everything, magic, danger, love, lust, loyalty, and time travel.  The sequel is almost better!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing! Great and easy read. I recommend it to all Hunger Games fans and those who have not read the series as well.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have this game on my phone, ipad, and kindle.  It is a great time killer and an enjoyable play.  You will not regret downloading it.  Especially since its free!
B008EL4YX6|5.0|I have enjoyed this game and it works very well on my Kindle Fire. I found it more relaxing than some puzzle games,  yet is presents a challenge. Some complained of its sound effects, but I found no problem. I can adjust the sound level on my Fire though. For those who found the game too hard,  I can only say -Don't condemn the game. I dislike reviewers that bash a game only because they haven't the patience to work the puzzles and try different solutions. I enjoyed this game and would recommend it to others.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|This app. Makes shopping. Browsing  or viewing your account easy and fast. Itls nice to be able to use it on the go. Thanks Amazon!
B008BM9L72|5.0|It was the most exciting book I have ever read it rekindled mine and Franks sex life.  Suggest every couple buy it and read it especially men they will read how to treat a woman.
B0088RQ4TI|2.0|Ok but not great. That's why I skipped it in the movies. The story was weak and the acting was too.
B008602KQI|5.0|Movie was just as good as the book, which is rare.  I can't wait for the others to be released!
B004TI5N38|5.0|Very good book, entertaining, fast paced and believable characters.  I was saddened toward the end of the book during one of the climactic events but the main character kept up the good fight.  I would hope to see more books follow this man.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|This book starts out with a bang and just keeps going. I was constantly guessing who it was and was always wrong. This is what a suspense and thriller novel is all about.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|This type of book has been long overdue and who better to write it than Richard Dawkins. For far too long our children have been indoctrinated by lies, fairy stories and downright devious writings by all religions. This book is an honest, informed and educational appraisal . The sad thing is only or mostly Athiests will read it as religious people have closed minds.<br /><br />\\" if it was possible to reason with religious people there would be no religious people\\"!
B008KGPEQG|4.0|Paul Auster's Winter Journal is a well-written and enjoyable summation of his emotional life as he lived it -- from the perpective of his late sixties. You get a keen sense of who he was and who he is. However, if you're expecting a literary journal, as in \\"And then I wrote,\\" this is not the book for you. To enjoy this book fully, you should probably have read one of Auster's fictional works previously.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a powerful and moving story, and is fairly faithful to the first book. I highly recommend reading the book before watching the movie, though, or it might not make much sense!
B0071DJZZA|5.0|This book is so good. Even the apges with the usually boring details are riviting! My only complaint is that I wish I had more time to read it so I wouldn't have to put it down!
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|Fantastic quality and a real enjoyable season to watch. I streamed it from my XBOX 360 and the quality was excellent! I don't recall any technical /performance issues at all!!
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I enjoyed readin the 50 shades of grey books. Was very intresting insight in to a different life style.<br />Wish I had that kind of money
B003B02O14|5.0|I am not a big reader ... but I could not put this novel down.  Finished in two days.  One of Grisham's best.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|sweet app. Seems like this app. also charges the battery much faster. Which is totality rad. I give this app 5 &quot;shocka bras&quot; out of 5
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I am glad that I didn't have to watch this one week at a time - couldn't have waited that long for the next show each week.
B004FHP9KA|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  The characters are interesting and well-developed. The acting is superb.  The plot is innovative with so many complexities that you almost need a score card to keep up. This is not a movie that you view once and completely get it.  Just learning the rules of \\"a dream within a dream within a dream\\" (the central premise) will take multiple viewings.  Your senses are on high-alert throughout the movie.  This is a thinking persons film, not mindless entertainment.  That said, it is also loads of fun.  Lots of action and amazing special effects.  Another nice thing about this movie is that you can feel completely comfortable watching it with your kids--a rare feature in movies of this caliber. I cannot imagine anyone coming away from this movie dissapointed.
B008602KQI|4.0|The Hunger Games series was great, but as in all movies, things had to be left out. But it was a very good movie anyways. I recommend watching it if you never read the book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you use Pinterest already, this app is awesome. I find it easier to navigate than on my desktop - certainly use it more now!
B00846TRHY|5.0|This is an honest story with a lot of heart behind the message. Don't be scared by its title. Watch it today:
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I read the whole series to find out what was really wrong with Christian and for that matter Ana that she had so little self esteem that she let him dictate to her.  I'm hoping the young girls reading this series don't take this as a cue to how a relationship should function a man dictating to a women and absolute control...NOT healthy girls.<br /><br />Ms James as I've said before has talent and she should definately continue to write.  However, the depth I was looking for was just not there.  By the third book I was skimming through the sex scenes because they were always a repeat of the previous from the prior books.  Just because its in a different place doing and saying exactly the same thing doesn't make it exciting.<br /><br />Would I recommend this as a good read, for the sex yes, for the literary prose, no!
B008M34CSI|3.0|Good action movie, but there seems to be something missing. It's worth watching while cleaning up the loving room or organizing the kitchen.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This story is captivating; the author is articulate; but I would loved to have more \\"flesh on the bones\\". It seemed too short for me and needed more detail, filling out. I hope she will undertake another such adventure and write a second book.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|this trilogy was so good. im very sad that there wont be any more :( i feel like i know the characters and want to read more about their lives following this sequence of events
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Amazing installment in the series. Very excited for the sixth book to come out. Character development is some of the best I've read in any fantasy series.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I ordered this through amazon for my mother in law to read on my iPad since her nook was broke and she was near the end.  I figured what the hell since I paid for it, I might as well read it too.  Just like I thought, the negative reviews were accurate.  It was nowhere near as steamy and seductive as people I knew had previously told me.  To me, it was too unbelievable.  Apparently this woman is super orgasmic.  Who has an orgasm the first time they have sex, much less multiple ones?  I could be wrong but I certainly dont know any.  The book was not well written and did not make me feel like I was part of the story as so many women have claimed it had for them.  I guess to each his own.
B00866H7SS|4.0|This was a good book, well written, but I think I have read it too soon after 50 shades of grey, the characters are too similar, I should have waited a couple of months, other than that, it's all good.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|WOW !!!  This book keeps you spellbound and wanting more of Mr. Grey :)  Great love story with a \\"playful\\" and naughty backdrop .
B00130UFY2|5.0|The Bourne Series is one of my favorites.  In the middle of a marathon my disk went bad,  I got on line ordered the disk with the temporary instant video.  By the time I brought up Amazon on my T.V. the movie was ready to watch.  Two days later my new disk arrives.  You can't get better service than that.  The instant video was clear and without any problems.
B007OY64C8|4.0|Of the 2  Wyatt Earp  movies  ( Kevin Costner)  this is the better.watched both more than once,  and made that decision.  Love Val Kilmer
B0083VFEMW|5.0|And yet another fantastic album from the Scissor Sisters. From the dance-pop to the more mellow. The album encompasses everything you'll need for a long car ride, work out, or fun night at home while you're having a Kiki.
B000YAFE0M|5.0|I watched this 6 times....so far.<br />Soooo good,  Ryan, handsome and smart..Anthony has a little \\"Hannibal\\"  in him.<br />excellent story  and thrilling.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I can't believe this was the author's first novel!  It was beautifully written and captured me from the very beginning.  I actually mourned for a week when I completed it.  Looking forward to more novels from Ms Diffenbaugh!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|It's been a while since I read a book I could no put down. Well paced,plot twists,interesting characters( who you may not always like) make for a page turner. Go get this book now.
B006LSZECO|4.0|this was a captivating read that was hard to put down. once I got into it, I just wanted to see what was going to happen next. it was an interesting view of a relationship and the dynamic between husband and wife in a wildly unique situation. the only thing I wasn't crazy about was the end, I felt it was abrupt after some build up and I would have liked a more conclusive ending. overall, a great read
B008602KQI|5.0|Movie was good, but I enjoyed the books so much more, I was almost disappointed in the movie but understand that the books can carry so much more depth and can give more detail. All in all I still enjoyed the movie, just don't read the books first. Read them after you watch the movie.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|No movie is ever as good as the book, but they did a good job staying with the main storyline.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|After the blush of first romance, there is the inevitable lull.  That's true with Season 2 of The Walking Dead.  Don't get me wrong.  It's still really good!  But Season 1 had me riveted to my seat, with the blinds drawn, and once in the while, made me pause my Blu-ray to take an adrenaline break to peek out the window and make sure that the world was still right.  Season 2 still has that suspense but does take time to develop the characters and bring it to a chilling conclusion.  Nice work.  Who doesn't want to find out what happens to the characters?!  I can't wait for Season 3.
B005LZW8FO|4.0|Like other reviewers have mentioned, this is less of a sci-fi movie and more of a drama.  However, I don't think it would have been as impactful without the sci-fi element.  I would agree that there are some slow parts of the movie, but I was not distracted by them.  Overall, the pace and tone of the movie seemed to fit perfectly with the storyline.  It was a very interesting and thought provoking film.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Had a hard time getting thru this book - the other two were a breeze - I could'nt put those down.<br />This is just a little more of a drag...You will still enjoy it - just not as much - kinda a let down!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Well-written, spell-binding, with good character development.  It kept me guessing as to the ending which I thought was very realistic.
B002DD67XG|5.0|I've have this on cassette and cd. When it went on sale for 99 cents figured it was worth the purchase again.
B003DDKAT2|5.0|Just as the title says I am very pleased with the movie. I think they did a good job keeping up with the book. They kept the integrity of Anne Rice's classic novel. Tom Cruise did an excellent job as Lestat. I would recommend this movie to anyone especially Anne Rice fans.
B003L77GG0|5.0|The end lives us with the expectation that the stories will transform into \\"SMALLVILE THE KENT'S\\",  and a real good chance of a more realistic  superman when it comes to manage the transition.
B0082FPIY8|5.0|This book was better than I thought. I thoroughly enjoyed it , I felt like I was there every step of the way with Cheryl. I did not want it to end, I wished she kept walking her engaging writing had me. I could not put it down I totally recommend it to all even if you are not a hiker.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was so bad. Makes twilight look like literary genius. If you want to see what the hype is about, dont bother. It's baseless.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The book kept me interested to see what was going to happen next. Wanted to keep reading into the next book..
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl was one of the best books I've read in a very long time.  Great characters, strong plot, lots of twists!  Extremely well written and thought out - kept me on the edge of my seat until the very last page.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! I am a recent fan of his work and from the first book to the last I just couldn't stop reading it. I like how the story is told from different characters' views. I am a huge fan of Melanie 's Dragon trilogies, and this definitely ranks up there with those. Great!
B007U8UBGI|5.0|This album is incredible. I listen to it on repeat pretty much any occasion. I would recommend it to both Jack White fans and people who have never listened.
B005LAIGP0|5.0|For fans of the book, you won't be disappointed. For fans of the original tv-movie, you're in much - needed luck. This movie will send shivers down your spine many-a-nights! Brace yourself, The Woman In Black is coming with a vengeful malevolence that has not made watching a scary movie this much fun in years! Hammer is back and what better way to honor what's come before than with the most frightening ghost story of them all!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It's fun to play and has a lot of puzzles.  Fun to play when waiting in line anywhere or just bored and wanting to have fun.
B007Z0TL1W|4.0|A disturbingly creepy cautionary tale about the consequences of breaking into an old woman's haunted old house! Let's just say you will get more than you bargained for and this film is an absolute Halloween treat!
B008602KQI|5.0|Everyone says that you have to read the book to really understand the movie but I totally disagree.  I followed the movie just fine and have never read the book.  Also, I'm not an avid movie watcher and if the movie is not interesting enough to keep my attention I fall straight to sleep.  I definitely did not have that problem with this movie.  It kept my attention the entire time!  It's very rare for me to say this but this movie definitely gets 5 stars from me!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|These two.books are excellent I am now reading The Trilogy.  The only problem I have is I can't read fast enough,  do not have the time . The books are exciting sensual and very romantic all at the same time. I'm wondering who is going to play the part in the movie.  WOW.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|I would give it 2.5 stars.  Somewhere between I don't like it and it's ok.  It's just a typical sequel.
B0050QV0RQ|3.0|good game easy to control.. but the story very short.. and very difficult to get in to the flying ship....
B008602KQI|4.0|I loved these books, even though I know that the book version is always better than the movie, I couldn't resist! This movie was really good! Some things that were changed or deleted I can understand, but others I can not.I would say that the overall \\"feel\\" of the book remains intact. Looking forward to seeing what happens in the sequels!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I have only read about half but it is really good.  I enjoy the short story format<br />as I can read a whole episode in one sitting, cool.
B008KPDYQY|4.0|This is your typical Jason Segel movie. If you enjoy his other movie appearances you will without a doubt enjoy The Five Year Engagement.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Couldn't believe there is a Pinterest app to use on my Kindle! Love the ease of it and never had any issues.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was completely against reading these books. But, I decided to watch the movie on a long flight home from vacation. As soon as I got home, I purchased the second book. A friend told me that the first book provided so much more insight and detail than the movie let on and she was right! The thoughts of Katniss and the intricasy of the various relationships comes out so much more by reading the book. I will be reading these over and over again. I know it!
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|A very well done addition to the \\"vampire genre\\". Done in a \\"Land of the Dead\\" style.<br />The mysterious expert vampire slayer. His teenage apprentance. Traveling and fighting for their servival. All in hopes of finding that special destination. And will there be a sequal? I hope so!<br />[[ASIN:B005FJ7DOM Stake Land]]
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Download was quick and easy. I has not had freeze up problems like my kindle has. Dont know if its software or hardware issue
B007Z9RAI4|4.0|I love House and even the less entertaining ones are good for me.  I cannot believe Wilson has cancer.  Maybe he's exiting the show.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|For someone who likes love stories this is a page turner.  Keeps you interested from page one to the end with a suspended ending that leaves you wanting book 2.
B004LWZW24|4.0|If you're looking for a movie that'll send its share of shivers down your spine, then you could do a lot worse than Insidious.  A Haunted House movie that delivers what you expect yet still does its durndest to avoid cliches sounds like more than one could dare to hope for.  And Insidious comes very very close to being that good.<br /><br />The cast is very believable in their roles.  The chemistry between Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne is there.  These feel like a well adjusted couple with a handful of kids.  You could see this group walking through the neighborhood grocery store and buy that they are a family.  The two ghostbuster characters bring in a bit of needed comic relief, but not so much as to derail the tone of the flick.  The character of Elise does a fine job of enhancing the spooky factor. Not because she's a creepy person, simply because the information she brings to the table raise the stakes dramatically and the actress does a fine job in not going over the top in what most movies probably would have made a showier role.<br /><br />The movie is there to frighten you and it does a very good job with the creep out parts.  The director knows how to play an audience and he has a lot of fun trying to get you to pull that pillow you're gripping in even tighter.  I particularly enjoyed the fact that daytime was not treated like a safe haven.  The different ghosts and spirits were diverse and did well in playing with several different fears.<br /><br />The first hour of this movie was building up to make me believe I was dealing with a modern classic in the horror genre.  Then the third act happened.  The thing is, that last half hour isn't necessarily bad.  In fact I appreciated its attempt to go in a bit of a different direction than a normal haunted house movie.  I simply felt that the execution didn't live up to its ambition.<br /><br />For a fan of movies full of fright, I have no hesitation in saying it is a movie worthy of your time.  I just wished that the brilliance of the first hour was followed through with a more satisfying conclusion.
B008XG1X18|5.0|When I cant be near my home computer, this app is great. I can see the pictures really well on my kindle.
B008602KQI|2.0|The movie was too predictable.  Hopefully the next ones in the series will have better story lines. I wasn't impressed by the special effects.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I have read this book three times.  Every time it revels new insights to the human condition.  It is a serious work of art.  I read it this time, as the movie is about to be released. With a director like Ang Lee it will have to be one not to miss.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|After having read all 5, when they first came out, I noticed in the last season's tv shows, some things I failed to remember or remembered incorrectly.  So, when season two was over I restarted this third volume in prep for next tv season.  I noted two things.  While I remembered general plot lines, there are just too many characters and too much happening to them to really remember most of it.  I'm 2/3rds through and have relearned a lot.  Oh, while the maps are useful in the hard copies of the books, this volume was so large I started to break the binding in swithching from text to maps.  If you have one, I suggest you get the e-reader copy in addition.  Saves the binding and is MUCH more convenient when you're travelling with the books.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Once I started reading I couldn't put the book down.  Not much of a reader but this trilogy was great!!
B008B1VYP0|4.0|All the songs are great! But it's pretty clear that they are trying to become even more main-stream by having all these pop-y songs. That is actually really unlike their style. I listened to their \\"songs about jane\\" album in comparison and it's evident that they've changed a lot.
B007JRU2UK|4.0|This is a nice, warm, enjoyable film.  Kind of like eating your mom's apple pie or mashed potatoes.  It is worth a watch.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It was a good movie.  I would have liked it to have a little more action.  I would reccomend it to anyone.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|The movie was quite good as a stand alone. My favorite casting was Lenny Kravitz as Cinna. Its hard to match the gripping feeling of the book but it came pretty close. I'd definitely recommend watching it.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I would have considerd this an ok book in the genre of trite romance novels, but huge disappointment for a NY Times best.  Cliche charactors, standard unrealistic romance plot.  Don't bother.  Stop the madness.
B008602KQI|4.0|I really enjoyed the Hunger Games book series,  I was drawn in instantly.  The movie was a little disappointing only because it didn't really capture some of the important details from the book.  It was a little off as to how she received the pin and changed the story a little.  Overall it was a good movie, I was very interested in how they would bring the book characters to life.  I gave it 4 stars because reading the book then watching the movie I was a little more excited about it.  I think if you just watch the movie you would probably rate it at 3 stars.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|This is a great old movie classic.  Don't miss it. Do you remember when watching a movie made you feel good?
B005ZMUZDU|5.0|This is a very cute story about a young girl who is looking to help her father.  I've always enjoyed this cartoon and will definitely watch it again.  Mulan is always getting into trouble but has good intentions,  her little side kick dragon really makes the show enjoyable.  I've watched it many times with my kids and everything down to the music is entertaining!
B008MJC6ZS|4.0|I hate hyperbole so this is going to be a short review. I don't like the bands politics but I do like the music. I Love the intra-personal lryics in some of the songs. I especially like the fact they are working with great drummers now. Louie Clemenete (from the first few albums) was sloppy, terrible pedal work, tons of passion but sloppy pedals will always cost. Testament is a fun band to listen to, clever  melodies, catchy hooks & great solos. Best of all a few years ago they broke a ten year drought and started making albums again. Chuck Billy has beaten healtyh issues and still has the same voice as back in the day. Not many bands can say that. Over another great album.
B008CP93S0|5.0|This is my new favorite movie. It's absolutely hilarious and now that I own it I can watch it whenever I need a pick-me-up! I bought it on Instant video but am now buying the DVD so I can watch it whenever I want.<br /><br />Buy this movie!!!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Great book...answered so many questions I've had for a while. A must-read for those who have struggled with weight issues.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I got the original Quell back in April when it was the FAOTD. I played it almost non-stop until I had finished. But I wanted more, so was thrilled to find Quell Reflect, which is equally addictive, and I was happy to pay the .99 for it. I'm hoping that since this is the FAOTD, maybe they are coming out with a new one.<br /><br />Very challenging for such a simple game. Slide the raindrop around the board collecting pearls while avoiding obstacles. There are in-game instructions as each new obstacle is introduced. If you finish a puzzle with a perfect score you get a hint. The puzzles get progressivly more challenging with each stage so save those hints. There are 21 stages with four puzzles each, plus you can get four bonus puzzles by tapping the fan on the home page. If you don't solve a puzzle in the least number of moves you can go back and try again and it will tell you what your previous best score was.<br /><br />The options are standard, Music, Sound, Tutorial, Hints with the addition of Switch Profile so up to three people can play simultaneously on the same device. A nice feature. The music is very soothing and features six different pieces so it does not get repetitive. Read the credits to see what they are. I also recommend you read The Making of Quell. They are both listed under Extras. I found it pretty interesting.<br /><br />It plays beautifully on my Kindle Fire. Even if you miss this as the FAOTD you won't regret paying for it. Now I think I have to reset both games so I can start over again :)
B008602KQI|5.0|I really liked those movie. It has a good plot and follows the book well. It will leave you wanting the sequel.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|I have read all three of the Fifty Shades books and it was the fist time I had read books with adult content but it wasn't the main focus for me, I was really interested to know how it would pan out for the two main characters and I wanted to know what would happen to them in the end. So it was interesting in Freed how both changed their views to make their relationship work. All three books flowed beautifully from one to another and I would love to read more of E L James.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|THis was one of the best books I read all year 2012. Thank you Carol for the great expereience! I recommend this book to everybody who are interested in changing how to meet other people and loves learning!
B003O86FMW|3.0|Not as thrilling in its pace and concept as the first but enjoyable none the less. The story does have a nice twist in the end but it was somewhat predictable. Also, I think that even books that serve as part of trilogies should be well structured enough to stand freely as a story on their own, which this book sadly doesn't.
B005G5PPGS|2.0|- Gives a small kick - not a big one! Anyhow I can recommend this one to people who are familiar with baseball.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Good book I  liked the balance of action and background stories it gave to the characters. I am excited to see what happens next.
B003CI90MQ|4.0|Not bad.  Light reading.  Humor sometimes is over the top but it gives some concise suggestions that make sense.  I got a few tips out of it and reference it from time to time.
B005K17RU0|5.0|At one time or another I've installed almost every decent weather app out there. I've also deleted just as many!  This app is BY FAR the best of them all. No glitches or dopey gimmicks, just simple easy info. The time lapse radar is also a NICE touch.
B007SGM084|2.0|I was dying to read this because of the hype but have found in the past that it sets me up for disappointment.This time was no different. The story had promise but the verbage became so repetitive and formulaic that I got bored. Don't listen to the hype.
B004LROUNG|3.0|This book tends to be tedious rather than attention grabbing.  The plot just seemed to drag out interminably.  Not among his best work.
B004J4WLPU|4.0|I thought the book started a little slow but I was definitely excited to keep reading and find out what happened. Overally, a really good read.
B008TRUDAS|2.0|Meh. Pretty predictable and unbelievable and not worth the price they increased it to. Definitely geared more toward teen girls.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This series is a definite must watch. Action in every episode. A little violent at times with lots of gore.
B008602KQI|5.0|The thing I liked best about this purchase was that the digital copy was automatically put in my Amazon Video Library at Midnight of the day it was released. I watched it the first time on my computer at 12:30am. This was a fun series of books to read, especially the first two volumes. I am looking forward to the next release. Only sad it is over a year away. Definately worth it!!!
B000FBJFSC|4.0|As a person of Irish descent, I decided it was high time I read Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt and to be honest, from the first chapter to the last I was ready to throw the book against the wall. In fact, after the end of each chapter, I would throw the book and scream. Not because it was a horribly written book, but because it brought out emotions about my Irish descent that I didn't know I had.<br /><br />Although sometimes comically written, McCourt's childhood memories in Limerick, Ireland, primarily portrayed appalling living conditions, irresponsible parents, and ignorance beyond belief.<br /><br />In my opinion, most of this ignorance was from the ridiculously undying devotion to the Catholic Church. Even though, the church repeatedly slammed the door into the faces of poor, they still believed.<br /><br />I was very depressed when I finished the book and if I'd had one wish in my life, it would have been to change my Irish last name. But, then I asked myself, so, why did I keep reading? I was hoping for a happy ending, which it was...sort of. But, for other reasons, too.<br /><br />To credit McCourt, he did write a compelling book or I wouldn't have picked it up off the floor night after night. Every stereotypical Irish joke is supported (i.e., drunken fathers, constantly pregnant mothers, etc.), which were hopefully attributed to the times.<br /><br />But I also learned about the pride of the Irish during some of the worst treatment and struggles that one country can endure. If nothing else, I've gained knowledge of the strength of the Irish. And meaning of those fight songs I hear at the Irish pubs. ☺<br /><br />My recommendation: it's a fascinating read, but if your ancestors were Irish immigrants, prepare yourself for an emotional roller coaster ride. It's maddenly worth it.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|This is a great read. I don't do reviews where I tell you what happens - you read the book for that! I will tell you the writing style is great. Lots of interesting points are made and the entire story is that much more interesting because it could happen tomorrow. Before I finished reading this book - I made sure I had his next one on hand ready to go. I am reading that now and it is just as good. Looking forward to his third book.
0425263908|5.0|Bared to You is the perfect book for after 50 Shades of Grey.  I finished the 50 Shades series in a little over a week, I had no clue what to read next, nothing satisfied my need for that kind of book and the problem was that you never heard about these kinds of books, at least until 50 Shades.  My friend mention this book which he loved and I decided to give it a try. I like it better in the way that it really shows Gideon cares rather than with Christian Grey and at the beginning he really only wants sex for the majority of the first book.  All in all this is a great book and I can't wait for the second on October 2!! :)
B008602KQI|5.0|Having read and thoroughly enjoyed all of the Hunger Games trilogy I expected that perhaps the movie could not live up to book.  But I was wrong.  The movie is terrific: great acting, great cinematography, great drama. Believable fiction!! I will watch this one more than once.  Can't wait for the next movie and wonder if perhaps it might come out in 3D as that was perhaps the only possible improvement I could have wished for in the first movie.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Steven King has done it once again.  He is known as the King of Horror, but this masterfully written book is none of that.  Its is nice to see how he references IT in this novel, but it doesn't distract the reader.  Actually it makes the reader smile if he has read his past novel.  The book has great depth and as usual he is very descriptive right down to the frayed cord from a 1950's era fan.  Loved the book and would recommend to any Steven King fan,<br /><br />Mike
0857685848|5.0|This book is loaded with great, full color depictions of beautiful, sometimes stunning, artwork. This is a nice, detailed introduction a number of accomplished, extremely talented artists, with lots of examples of their (very good) work. The artwork is not limited to dinosaurs - it includes prehistoric reptiles, and there is a section with pretty incredible art by Mauricio Anton depicting prehistoric mammals. I just got the book, so I have not read all of the text (there are a lot of interviews with the artists, etc.), but even just a quick run-through tells me that if you enjoy looking at pictures of what these animals probably looked like (OK, colors are anybody's guess, but you have to decide on something), you will love this book - it is a great value just for the number and quality of the pictures alone.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool was a great read.  My one minor complaint was that Wool 2 was probably the slowest of the entire 5 novellas.  Obviously this is my opinion but the amount of time spent on the relationship between the mayor and deputy and their descent down the silo to meet with Jules was a little drawn out and the entire story line would have moved ahead faster if this were significantly condensed. Other than this very minor complaint, the character development and pacing was very well done.  The book built up speed in the final couple of books and had a satisfying conclusion while still leaving the door open for future volumes.  It is great to see how an indie writer is capable of putting out such a high quality, well edited story for a very reasonable price.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is great!  It starts out slow buy once you get in to it you don't want to put it down.  The book has so many twists and turns.
B003OPUZYY|5.0|What a deal, a three disc collection of Ten Years After's best tunes from their 1969-1972 Chrysalis Years. I purchased this compilation through Amazon and it was money well spent. 48 great tunes, can you believe it?<br /><br />These tunes come from some of their early albums:<br /><br />-Ssssh<br />-Cricklewood Green<br />-WATT<br />-A Space In Time<br />-Rock And Roll Music To The World<br /><br />Alvin Lee wrote 99.9 percent of all tracks, vocalist, guitarist extraordinaire, he's the man! The music is always hot, searing fretwork. He's considered one of the fastest guitarists of all time. Each album varies in style in my opinion, but are all a classic mix of the blues and rock n' roll.<br /><br />Great purchase for lovers of classic Rock and Roll.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book. First chapter felt a bit amateur and then I got into the storyline and was really drawn into the unique relationship. Didn't put the book down and finished it in two days. Definitely a fun read, as were the last two in the series.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is a great love story with not too much sex. If you liked 50 shades of Gray then read this
B00274EYKY|3.0|Good movie but predictable. A lot of performers in these brutal sports go through this tough and wild lifestyle. They realize what's important when it's too late. Then loose it all.
1476712042|5.0|This Beautiful Disaster was one of the best reads I have ever experienced!  It pulled at my heart in so many ways!  I can truly connect with the feelings and emotions!  Can't wait for my copy of Walking Disaster!
B0092D1V5Y|1.0|this app uncovers privet wifi passwords that are ment to be kept privet. not worth loading<br />and not ment to uncover use with caution
B0000714BP|5.0|I bought this movie on a whim for my dad after he mentioned it one night. It arrived quickly and in excellent condition and played through without any problems. Would definitely buy from this dealer again.
B000IDEORY|5.0|My 17 year old granddaughter had NEVER seen this movie because her dad didn't like the name; so of course Nana gave the child some culture !! I mean, he lets her play Modern Warfare but not Patrick Swayze?<br />Love the movie--but didn't play right. kept rebooting- Amazon already reimbursed me.
B008EQIK90|3.0|Comical. It pokes fun at the differences between the decades of high school students.<br />Funny stuff.<br /><br />I laughed.<br />I'm glad in watched it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Been waiting on this app for forever! And it's finally here! and works great!!! now I can pin no matter where i am, and not just have to remember to pin this or that the next time i'm on my computer!
B003TSEEDY|2.0|The book is to slow and repetitious. The only thing I can compare it to is a bad '70s 'After School Special'.
