B004HEXSLI|4.0|Jill Bolte Taylor became a brain researcher so she could better understand her own brother, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia. But in 1996, Taylor got a unique opportunity to study her own brain when a blood vessel in the left side of her brain exploded. In My Stroke of Insight, Taylor takes the reader through the details of that morning, as she slowly lost different functions of her mind. Then she talks of her long recovery and provides some valuable advice for how to interact with someone who has experienced a stroke.<br /><br />Taylor's detailed description of her stroke, starting with a pounding headache and progressing to the point of losing her ability to walk, talk, read, write or remember anything about herself, is truly fascinating. It's also very educational in that it should help readers recognize the signs of a stroke more fully.<br /><br />I'd say My Stroke of Insight is a combination of memoir, biology lesson and advice. As she describes her experiences, Taylor provides details on the way our brain works. She talks about the two sides of our brain, and the different functions of each. During her stroke, Taylor's left brain was affected, so she explains how it felt to be completely controlled by her right brain. She also provides a list of the \\"Forty Things I Needed the Most,\\" which I expect would be invaluable to anyone whose loved one has experienced a stroke.<br /><br />Overall, this was an educational book, not merely a memoir. I happen to find the brain very interesting, so I really enjoyed this aspect of the book. But if you're not interested in learning about the way your brain works, I expect you might get bogged down in the details. She has a section at the beginning of the book in which she gives a lesson on the way the brain works before she delves into her experience. She mentions that you're welcome to skip this section, and I think you should if it's not your thing.

B0034G4ORC|4.0|The Review:<br /><br />Battle: Los Angeles looks to be staking its claim as 2011's action movie to beat, largely living up to its super intense preview trailers.  While Battle: Los Angeles is not particularly original or daring, it is an incredibly well made sci-fi action movie in the same vein as Cloverfield and the much maligned Skyline.  But where Cloverfield and Skyline put the audience in the shoes of civilians during an alien invasion, Battle: Los Angeles embeds the audience with a group of marines.<br /><br />Battle: Los Angeles jumps right into the action - opting to forego a long build up.  It's present day Los Angeles and aliens are literally falling from the sky off the coasts of every continent.  These aliens do not come in peace. They have come to pillage our natural resources and have us severely outgunned.  The movie follows a group of marines on a search and rescue mission as the military plans to level a significant portion of the city to deny the aliens a beachhead for their invasion.<br /><br />Now it's a testament to how well made Battle: Los Angeles is, that it's actually quite easy to suspend your disbelief.  This easy suspension of disbelief is thanks to Aaron Eckhart, who plays Staff Sergeant Michael Nantz, the de facto leader of sci-fi fantasy's answer to Band of Brothers.  Nantz has put in his twenty years and has seen a lot of tragedy.  Despite having all the trappings of a squared jawed action hero, Eckhart brings a lot of emotion and humanity to the role.  Yes, he kicks ass, but despite his seeming invincibility I was always worried about him and his marines.<br /><br />Your enjoyment of Battle: Los Angeles will depend on your tolerance for the typical weaknesses in Hollywood disaster movies.  There will be a solid hour of ridiculous explosions.  At points I felt that I was watching someone play Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.  And you kind of have to leave your critical thinking at the box-office to accept some of the typical action movie ingredients, such as the countdown until something will be blown up to further the plot.  Ask yourself, why do technologically superior aliens feel the need to land and fight our military forces house to house when their technology gives them the ability to drop meteors on us from orbit?  Why does the lynchpin of their diabolical plan have an easily exploitable weakness which the enemy can take dangerous advantage of?<br /><br />But all this is nitpicking.  Battle: Los Angeles does not aspire to be nor is it the smartest action movie, but it does set out to be an immersive, though somewhat predicable alien invasion movie.  And as much as one can get one's monies' worth for a $13 movie ticket, Battle: Los Angeles is worth the price of admission.  Think of Battle: Los Angeles as a 21st century take on the movie Independence Day.<br /><br />FTC Advisory: We purchased our own tickets.tdown until something will be blown up to further the plot.

B002ZG981E|5.0|.....Or at least in My Humble Opinion.<br /><br />So, at first when I heard of this movie I was suspicious not a little but a LOT. I mean, this film basically has every element that will make it a \\"mess\\" for me :-<br /><br />(A) It has a complicated plot that will probably make no sense at all.<br /><br />(B) It's gonna be totally unbelievable and totally ridicules.<br /><br />(C) It's A Sci/Fi DUH ! I hate Sci/Fi.<br /><br />And what even made me more suspicious is that one of my friends have seen it and \\"hated\\" it. I quote \\"couldn't even finish the movie\\" due to the unclear completely confusing story line.<br /><br />I have to admit that all of the above made me put this movie off for a while, even If I've already bought the DVD but another friend of mine was urging me on watching it because as yet I quote again \\"It's SOOOO Good and a must see\\" that I had to satisfy my curiosity and given in.<br /><br />.......and I'm glad I did !<br /><br />This movie wasn't just \\"good\\" it was brilliant ! Fantastic and totally Awesome ! Seriously, probably the best Sci/Fi movie I've ever seen and the most fun film I've enjoyed like really enjoyed in a long time and that's coming from someone who doesn't normally watch Sci/Fi.<br /><br />Usually when I watch a movie, I either skip some parts, let the movie play on my DVD while I do other things like doing a project, assignment or read an article or whatever. Sometimes I would leave the movie playing while I do other things and sometimes I would \\"Pause\\" the movie and return to seeing it at other times.  This movie However had a gratifying effect on me, it just made me totally glued to the chair, there were parts in it where I was wondering How did they do that ? Especially the part when they were floating in the air was pretty cool and I haven't been wondering about this kind of stuff since I was in primary school.<br /><br />I think the major problem for this movie is that some people may not understand the plot line and I don't blame them, I mean the plot is kinda complicated and hard to get into unless you're paying a close attention you'll probably get that facial expression on your face that says \\"Whaaaaat ????\\" or \\"Ehhhh, I don't get this\\".<br /><br />That's why for the sake of understanding the movie, I'd recommend you do as I did. Turn the lights off, remove any element of distracting, don't get busy doing anything else or you won't understand the movie. Stay in a quite nice corner and just relax and watch the film. See if you won't understand it, never \\"pause\\" unless you have to.<br /><br />The filmography was amazing ! The directing was cool, the scenes beautifully made all the virtual stuff are awesome too. The acting fantastic and the premise is Original and creative and completely interesting.<br /><br />I would recommend this film to every Sci/Fi lover, and if you don't like Sci/Fi I would recommend you give this movie a try you might like it. Oh, and chicks it's not just a guy's movie I'm a chick and I loved it so maybe you would wanna watch it sometimes ;)ess you're paying a close attention you'll probably get that facial expression on your face that says \\"Whaaaaat ????\\" or \\"Ehhhh, I don't get this\\".

Now I must say this is not a small bible this is for putting on your table or podium for reading and studying you won't carry it for too long. I love this book Crossway has put together a really good Bible.

B004B63M1S|1.0|THIS IS PROBABLY THE DUMBEST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN....NO WAIT! IT IS THE DUMBEST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN.
B00000ICN5|5.0|Oh man, where the hell has SRV's debut been all my life?  Stevie Ray Vaughan is easiy my favorite blues guitarists ever, and that's no feat considering the competition.  Sure, I don't think Stevie is as monumental or as important as Hendrix or Robert Johnson, but when it comes to blues guitar, Stevie Ray Vaughan plays his guitar, making it sing and hitting me more than any other blues guitarists, even more impressive because this list includes other legends like BB King and Hendrix (certainly some of the best guitarists I've ever heard, I don't care about their hype either, I really believe it).  And Texas Flood is one hell of a debut to show why.<br /><br />One great thing about Stevie is the way he plays the Blues.  Like Hendrix or Page before him, Him and his double Trouble band isn't afraid to put a ton of energy and spice into the recordings, something that losers like John Mayer are never able to do.  Speaking of modern blues, I have to be honest with myself, I've never heard any good traditional style blues after Howlin' Wolf or Muddy Waters, almost all of it lacks grit and authenticity, seems fitting how rich in it's style that old blues had and never will come back.  Just try listening to that crap like that John Mayer, Blues Traveler (Ha ha) and the like tries to spew out.  As George Carlin says, it's a ____________ sacrilege.  However, as Led Zeppelin taught us, taking the emotion of blues and intensifying it like an electric chair does to a body, can make blues a powerful force emotional enough to resurrect a dead corpse.  And that's what Texas Flood does.  Stevie Ray's music isn't as loud and raunchy as Led Zeppelin, nor is it.  Texas Flood is much more rooted in traditional rock and roll styles along with country and Texan music (hence the name, of course), but Stevie Ray's band plays with a ton of influences into one and brings forth a varied batch of musical sounds.<br /><br />So why is Stevie such an excellent blues guitarist?  Not many other guitarists can make his guitar sing with such passion, emotion, and blues.  His playing is just so damn rich, and his guitar tone is absolutely perfect.  Crystal clear, a bit gritty, but extremely tasteful and ridiculously soulful.  The musical notes have a way of making you just close your eyes and digging deep into your , and the world around you seems to fade away from view.  There's a reason why so many blues guitarists (watch the way BB King Plays and he looks like he's channeling some unknown force too powerful to explain) just look like they are channeling, and Stevie Ray makes sure you feel it across the room so much that it enters your brain and taps into your soul.  I can't really quite explain it until you hear it, but SRV's guitar playing is like none other.<br /><br />Highlights?  Everything.  From the rock and roll rave up Love Struck Baby, the double shot of amazing Texas blues of, the title track, to the absolutely shimmering and beautiful Lenny, with not a note wasted anywhere in the whole song.  Really, all classic.  And really, how the heck can you go wrong with a musician that is able to turn into a nursery rhyme, a little kids song at that, into an awesome, scorching song that absolutely lights up a fire upon it.  No one has been able to do that before, and do right (sorry Chuck Berry).  As you can see, every damn song on this album rules to the high heavens.<br /><br />Apparently there are some people who like to bash people who love Stevie, and give them some crap about how you don't know blues, or something crazy like that.  Well, I've tried listening to all the other greats, and while they certainly are legends as well, Stevie's sound and playing is impeccable to me, no other guitarist has been able to channel the instrument into my emotions like SRV does.  Don't fool yourself, if you claim to be into blues rock and don't own any of Stevie's records, you are crazy.  Texas Flood is still my favorite, but the follow up .  His last album is terrificas well, although Texas Flood is a hair better in my opinion.  Either one you get, though, you can't go wrong.  Your rock and roll collection is complete without a little bit of SRV.is a hair better in my opinion.  Either one you get, though, you can't go wrong.  Your rock and roll collection is complete without a little bit of SRV.

Sung beautifully and with as much passion as if you were in that era!  I recommend this to anyone who loves the songs from Les Miserables!  Great job!  Oh, by the way...if anyone is wondering if Nick Jonas can really sing....Can he ever!!!  He did a wonderful job!  Awesome!!
B003LZ5B7S|4.0|Christopher Eccleston succeeded in reviving Doctor Who with an edge and humor that the series needed. Personally, this episode and Doctor was my introduction into the vast history of the Time Lords and other amazing and scary alien races. Since then, the the show has gotten much better and popular, spawning two other shows.     In short, see this show. It is one of the best television programs ever produced.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I do not watch any commercial television. I decided years ago that I did not want to be forced to watch anymore commercials. With the launching of Netflix I am now able to catch up on many of the series I missed when they were first being aired minus those stupid commercials.    I was hesitant at first to watch this series and almost skipped over it however I did watch it and I can tell you by the end of the first episode I was hooked. Everything about this series was right, cast members, character developement, story line, even the space ship design struck up a good feeling reminding me of how I use to catch fireflies on a warm summer evening in Ohio.    This show was a winner. It had the markings of becoming so huge the other networks would be scrammbling to come up with some type of copycat programming.    Yes, I do believe the decision makers at FOX are idiots.
B000KIRT6A|4.0|I purchased a VOX 100x2 amp and the thing had way to much low end at lower volumes. The vox forum website recommended this as a reasonable alternative. It works really well. Not very heavy though so you may want to put it on a non skid pad or mount to a board if you want to stomp it a lot.
B0041KKYEW|5.0|Comment: I didn't know what to expect from this movie (as a guy) going in. Another \\"chick movie\\" perhaps. I found this movie to be entertaining and held my interest all the way through. The story was good and the cinematography was great. The picture from the Blu-ray was outstanding. (Do we expect anything less these days?) The one comment I do have is about Mila Kunis... The 70's Show. She acts exactly the same in this movie as in The 70's Show. So... guys, when your lady asks for you to watch this movie with her... you could do a lot worse... a LOT worse.
0143034901|4.0|If you like Gothic novels, mystery and historical fiction, this book is for you! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it was hard to get into, but keep reading; your patience will pay off! This novel had some of the most interesting characters I've encountered in Literature (the protagonist's best friend, Fermin Romero de Torres, steals the show.) The novel is filled with converging stories, complex characters, and several twists, but be warned: it's not a light read.
0312243022|5.0|As I said elsewhere in my review of Andr&eacute; Dubus's THE HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG, I much prefer to read the book before I see the film, only because it becomes virtually impossible to divorce myself from the actors' portrayal of the characters in the book from what I imagine those characters to be as I read the book. As I also said in that same review, however, seeing the film first didn't necessarily detract from the book version of the story.  Such is also the case with Michael Cunningham's THE HOURS.<br /><br />When I first came out of the movie theater, I was depressed.  \\"Because of the subject matter of the movie?\\" you may well ask.  No, not in the least.  Rather, because I felt I could never write anything that good (and I assumed, given the integrity of the film, that the Director had stayed close to Cunningham's original storyline.<br /><br />When I next read the book, I closed it at the end and was equally depressed.  \\"Why\\" again?  Because reading the book only confirmed my earlier sense of resignation.<br /><br />THE HOURS is a flawless performance in celluloid and an equally flawless performance in prose.  Could Michael Cunningham rest on his laurels with this book?  I think he could.  I hope for all of us, however, that he won't.<br /><br />RRB<br />04/16/11<br />Brooklyn, NY, USA
B004FOA84A|5.0|I've been hoping to see some games of this type for Android. This is the first Android adventure/puzzle game I have found and I'm well pleased with it.

B000XUAEUS|5.0|I come to this review belatedly, and only after having seen the video version of this novel twice -- most recently, this evening.<br /><br />I first read ANY HUMAN HEART several years ago and on the recommendation of a good British friend -- no, actually, on the recommendation of the daughter of a former Swiss lover who married a Brit, but who has remained a good friend (as has her daughter) ever since.<br /><br />That British daughter's recommendation assured me at the time that I'd made the right decision in almost marrying her Swiss mother--that if only in following through, I might've had such a daughter.<br /><br />In short, I believe ANY HUMAN HEART -- both the novel and the film -- may be the best work of this era.  And possibly the last of its kind.<br /><br />I'm not optimistic about the future of literature -- and ANY HUMAN HEART is literature, make no mistake about it.  William Boyd's novel -- as well as the film for which he wrote the screenplay (and of which his novel is obviously the source) -- are the stuff of world literature.  At the very least, he has written the definitive novel of the Boomer Generation; at most, he has written a novel to compete with the best of novels of all time.<br /><br />Does ANY HUMAN HEART hold the same rank as DON QUIXOTE (the first and, in my opinion, the greatest of all novels ever written)?  I'll have to ponder that one for a while -- and while I continue to read William Boyd's other works.  In the meantime, however, I can't recommend strongly enough both the novel and the film.<br /><br />RRB<br />5/11/13<br />Brooklyn, NY

B00457WZEI|5.0|Having this week lost one of my three horses to a sudden illness, reading this book helped me deal with the pain and sorrow of that loss.  While this book may be intended for a younger audience, I can say that as a fifty-six-year-old, I enjoyed the book tremendously.  And without giving away too much of the plot or ending, suffice it to say that there are surprising turns and detours in the development of the story.  The author was quite clever in having the story told by a horse.  One should recall that even Homer brought in a talking horse in his story of the Iliad.  Death and war are not foreign topics to horses, unfortunately.

0743454537|3.0|The story itself was very intriguing.  I agree with some readers that the ending, while interesting, does NOT fit with the intended premise or moral of the story.  I also thought that Anna's 'voice' in the book was way off the mark.  Yes, she's a mature young lady.  However, she was speaking as if she was in her 20s and said things I would never think the brightest of children her age would say.

1843106698|2.0|As with almost all books written by \\"professionals\\" this is for professionals who sit behind a desk and have unreal image that \\"teachers\\" and the school systems are actually  interested in helping your child; they are usually seen as a problem and troublemaker to them. Parents, grandparents and those trying desparately to help the little ones, I was hoping to get some ideas and ideas on how to help but as with most books written by professionals only technical terms not dealing and treating the syndrome.  I have also found how truly \\"uneducated\\" the school system is about how to handle these situations. They are even less knowledgeable than I.

B004EQAVHI|3.0|The script is the main problem with this film. The director or writer spoke of the tendency for such individuals in any society to conform to their social conditioning, but the problem is that these types aren't interesting, only those that break free are, and in this film none do though the pair ask to do so and are told they cannot. The female lead should have been the one to do so, but all conformed till the end of their lives apparently. While that is nearly an exact portrait of most people in society, it is dull and not worthy of a film. Another problem is the male lead seems 'artistic' in his youth, but seems to have already had a lobotomy a few years later. It must have been the intent of the director to have that actor portray the character in that way, and his 'art' didn't seem 'special' to me at the end. The whole subtext of being 'ensouled' (Adamic) or not (PreAdamic) is mentioned in a way, but not investigated. In short, this is a film that could have been, but never was, and perhaps that was the same in the book. There was another such film on cloning done as a '70s tv movie that it reminds me of. The acting of the two female leads is excellent as they usually are, but don't make up for a failed script/directing. Watching it once is quite enough.

0887308589|5.0|Dilbert is one of those few comics that will stand the test of time. Probably because it is inspired by the real-life chaos and confusion of the workplace.

B004NGYXIM|1.0|I was so looking forward to this album and I expected Fher to bring Mana back to their roots. I was so disappointed when I finally listened to the entire album two, mabybe three songs out of the whole album would have been acceptable material as 'b' sides to their prior recordings. Not only is the entire production bland but, it seems that they're using rhythms from their prior glory days to relive their hits from the 90's. As a former friend of mine used to say, \\"good luck with that Bubba\\".   It's like Juanes and Shakira had a bastard baby and failed to abort it, horrific and nasty.   I'ms so glad I saw them live in concert in the 90's about five times before they started recording this type of garbage.  What a sad day for Latin music.

However, the long wait for future levels to unlock is kind of disappointing for those of us who fly through these levels in minutes. The golden eggs from the original and &quot;seasons&quot; versions are sorely missed. Fighting bosses at the end of episodes sort of makes up for it though.
B000091NZN|5.0|First part of my Boston collection and they are my favorite band. [TRACKS: AMANDA, WE'RE READY, THE LAUNCH, COoL THE ENGINES, MY DESTINATION, A NEW WORLD, TO BE A MAN, I THINK I LIKE IT, CAN'TCHA SAY, STILL IN LOVE, HOLLYANN ]<br />Overall great condition, came fast and was cheap so I would totally recommend this!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Best Apocalyptic TV series yet, very addictive drama/thriller and much better then most dedicated zombie movies, every episode roles into the next with much anticipation, 5stars all the way, bring on season two!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This is a pretty fun game. Good graphics, a few different modes. All of that with items to unlock, what's not to love? Its definitely a must try.
B003L77GRY|3.0|I've been a Dexter fan from First Season, first episode to now, however as good as Season V was, it was a let down in the final episode.  It was like they didn't know how to end it.  Where the other 4 Seasons final episode left you stunned and anticipating what's next in the new Season, this one just pettered out.  Too many loose ends, like the crashed car at the scene of final killing, plus the car was stolen by Dexter at the scene of the preivious killing in the van.  Deb would not walk away from her quest to catch the killer.....and on and on.  Anyway I'll look forward to the next Season, but I'm sure not counting the days like usual.  Get the good writers back that will keep us addicted to this show as it has been in the past.
B004LUHQ1G|4.0|I have to first say i have been a Fan of Foo Fighters since they  first came out in 1995 with their self titled album.  the past few years i lost my love for them but still liked and was waiting for what they would do next.  This album is called ''wasting light'' and i like it a lot. the album features krist novoselic, dave grohls former band mate from nirvana on the song called ''i should of known'' which should give any fan of nirvana a reason to celebrate since these two dont play together really at all.  i enjoyed the album i felt it was a real rock album by foo fighters. even the lead singer Dave grohl has stated the album is back to rock for them. so if you like the older rocking foo fighters from early days you will love this album. pat smear is on the CD as well, so you get many different and new aspects of the band and the music here. I give the Band a lot of credit to still be able to make good music after being together for over 15 years now and making music you can relate to and rock out too as well. any Foo Fan should get this album to add to their collection.
1439163146|5.0|I know what you're thinking, but don't worry this is not another Ethan Hawke situation.  You know, a hot, sexy, young, successful actor decides to write a book because he can.  The book is so cliché you want stab your brain with an ice pick.  James Franco's collection of stories will not make you want to stab your brain.  You'll want to hug and kiss your brain.  Maybe throw a party or two for your brain with cake and ice cream.  The stories are about troubled teenagers in Palo Alto.  The subject matter is very dark and disturbing but extremely readable.  Franco's writing is dreamy and distant.  He nails the confused California adolescent angst and boredom.  The second story is devastating.
B004WPIJ4I|5.0|I've learned love is like a brick you can  Build a house or sink a dead body    LOVE IT!  Great beat, awesome song.  I bow down and worship at the Haus of GaGa once again..    In the most Biblical sense,  I am beyond repentance    Join the club, sista!
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I just burned through this book because I could not put it down. There is comparison to Ravels Bolero and this book ends with a surprising crescendo as does that piece! Jusr loved it.
B004C6QDG8|5.0|\\"Maiden Voyage\\" by Herbie Hancock is one of those one-of-a-kind masterpieces which set the tone for much of the music which came after it.  The music is innovative and wonderfully-played; the members of the group seem to have ESP and play together as one.  Every song is a winner and this new SACD mastering improves on everything that came before it.  The sound is more lifelike, especially the bass, which seemed just a bit \\"tubby\\" on the RVG remaster (which itself is better than previous releases of this title).  APO discs are not inexpensive, but for those who can appreciate them, they truly bring out details which might have been hard to hear in previous releases, and this enhances the listening experience.  A winner before, even more a winner now.
B00393SFU2|4.0|This is the first Criterion release that I've ever seen and I have to say that I am quite impressed.  Fritz Lang's first \\"talkie\\" has been very well restored and although the picture quality is not perfect which would be unreasonable to expect of a 80-year film and the sound quality is also not perfect but in this case is not essential as the film works very well with Lang's direction and hence unique storytelling style making this is like [[ASIN:B0040QYROK The Complete Metropolis [Blu-ray]]] a few years earlier a film classic and another work of genius.  The rolling ball and the flying kite scenes for example \\"speaks\\" volumes and does more than tons of dialogue could do and if ever a film shows that a picture speaks a thousand words this one is it.<br /><br />Fritz Lang addresses another social ill here as he did in \\"Metropolis\\" but unlike that film the actual lesson is elusive.  The special features here are excellent and include an excellent interview conducted by director William Friedkin of [[ASIN:B001992NW4 The Exorcist (Extended Director's Cut & Original Theatrical Edition) [Blu-ray]]] and [[ASIN:B000BZIST4 The French Connection (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] of Lang in which he explains his intention was to instruct adults to be much more mindful of their children and that there is no excuse for neglecting them as they are the future and how well we look after them will determine what kind of a future we will have.  This was so prophetic when you look at Germany not too long after with the Hitler youth that was so important for the Nazi party for example or how misguided youth can lead to tragic consequences when due to negligence parents allow unsavoury elements to replace them.  The parents blame the police, the various criminal elements, the actual psychopathic killer, how busy they are with work i.e. everyone but themselves for the deaths.  Lang even in a way tries to weaken the case for blaming the perpetrator who is portrayed as this killer who wants to be caught witness his letter to the police inexplicably leaving clues to aid in his capture and in his impassioned apologetic for himself in front of the mob which even evokes sympathy for him.  This was very enlightening as because of various producer interference and hence various alternate endings and cuts which can be seen in the English version also included in this set it became very hard to see this thesis resulting in many people talking about how this film was about compassion for the insane criminal, the abolition of capital punishment for the insane, how insane is insane enough, the hypocrisy in society of how the \\"low-life\\" are targeted and assumed of the horrible crime of child murder when the perpetrator stands among the more \\"respectable\\" at least in society's eyes, the comedy of \\"low-lifes\\" judging a \\"lower life\\" etc.<br /><br />These are just a few lessons one can draw from the movie without viewing the movie in full and hence in the way the director intended it to be and you get it here as complete and as well restored as can be to date but only in the original German version which is the best way to view this; turn on the English subtitles if you need to as the English version hasn't been restored and the ending has been changed and so doesn't flow as well and is a pale parody of the German version.  What the German mother says as the last line of the film is critical to the meaning and is totally lost in the English version which has an alternate ending.  The fact that a 110 minute film generates so many talking points and is still relevant today with violence in various forms against children still rampant with many people blaming various things and pointing to various reasons when perhaps the answer is just better vigilance and spending more time with them so that the evils of the world can't get at them is testament to the greatness of this film and of Fritz Lang.  Indeed this to me is the definition of a great film that transcends time and remains relevant and thought-provoking even rewarding many repeated viewings and it is really sad that we don't get enough of these types of films today and we have to settle for mindless crap like \\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\\", \\"Dumb & Dumber\\", \\"Legally Blonde\\", \\"Scream\\" etc.<br /><br />Great Criterion release, well restored but not perfect picture and sound quality, great extras and excellent film makes this an easy review.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!levant and thought-provoking even rewarding many repeated viewings and it is really sad that we don't get enough of these types of films today and we have to settle for mindless crap like \\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\\", \\"Dumb & Dumber\\", \\"Legally Blonde\\", \\"Scream\\" etc.    Great Criterion release, well restored but not perfect picture and sound quality, great extras and excellent film makes this an easy review.

B0000C9ZLD|4.0|I adore this album. And the more I listen to it, and the more I hear other bands out there like The Stills and The Shins, the more I feel that the rest are all trying to be The Same: like The Strokes, but with less authentic rock and roll riffs.
B0040QYROK|4.0|This is the third Kino Blu-ray that I've watched after [[ASIN:B0036SPDEG Battleship Potemkin [Blu-ray]]] and [[ASIN:B002NTDX6O The General [Blu-ray]]] and this has got to be by far the best that I've seen!  \\"Metropolis\\" is now officially the best ever silent film that I've ever seen.  Kino has done an excellent restoration job both in finding as much of the lost material and hence making this as complete a version of the original as possible and in the excellent picture quality that we get here.  The much anticipated \\"lost\\" material from Argentina has been re-inserted and despite the horrible state of the film and hence the still poor picture quality from these frames the picture quality of the vast majority comprising of the other frames more than makes up for this and hence makes this a very enjoyable film to watch even today.  Where frames are still missing they have inserted intertitles to explain what is going on and while these are very few and far between mostly concentrated towards the end I really liked the idea as it makes this the most complete that \\"Metropolis\\" has ever been since the original release.  The original score is also very beautiful and just like for \\"Battleship Potemkin\\" greatly enhances the film coming now in excellent DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 Surround sound.  The special feature documentaries are also excellent.  Kino with the 3 blu-ray releases that I've seen so far is really trying to become a viable alternative to Criterion as the leading restorer of classic films and long may it continue!  Even the slipcase is a work of art coming with a holographic sticker in the front which is quite beautiful.  The special features especially \\"Voyage to Metropolis\\" are very good too.<br /><br />Watching what is now an 84-year film I was astonished at how relevant this film is even for today which is the mark of an excellent classic film.  If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then this film has be flattened by now :-)  While watching this I couldn't help but be reminded of other great films like [[ASIN:B003ZYU3T6 Modern Times  (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B000UBMWG4 Blade Runner (Five-Disc Complete Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray]]], episodes from \\"Star Trek: TOS\\" such as [[ASIN:B00005Q79B Star Trek - The Original Series, Vol. 37 - Episodes 73 & 74: The Lights of Zetar / The Cloud Minders]] and even in music such as [[ASIN:B000M7XSGO Time (Mlps)]] and [[ASIN:B000007R1M Man Machine]] or even [[ASIN:B000002GYI Computer World]] among many, many others all inspired by this beautiful film.  The theme of the exponentially increasing gap between the haves and the have-nots is still so relevant today when we look at the economic progress disparity among the so called developed and under-developed worlds and watching countries like North Korea and the recent events in Egypt, Libya and others in the Middle East is like watching the premise of \\"Metropolis\\" come to pass.  It's hard to distinguish watching the relevant scenes from \\"Metropolis\\" and the scenes on CNN or BBC of the reporting of those real-life events.  Mark Twain was certainly right that history may not repeat itself but it certainly rhymes.  The other theme of the dehumanisation of people when technical innovation is used solely for profit without regard for compassion and the well-being of our fellow man is still sadly relevant today when you look at the damage so called financial \\"innovation\\" has wrought on the lives of so many people in the wake of the recent financial crisis for example.  This film also ends very well when its thesis that the heart must be the mediator between the head and the hand is emphasised showing that if we apply common sense and compassion to innovation and technological growth then all of humanity will benefit and not just the few privileged greedy ones.<br /><br />This Kino Blu-ray release of \\"Metropolis\\" is an excellent job at restoring a movie classic which is now not only my favourite silent film everbut is also among my favourite movies of all time.  Good if not perfect picture quality restoration, great sound quality for the score and excellent overall packaging of a brilliant film makes this an easy review.<br /><br />Highly recommended!g my favourite movies of all time.

B001UV4XHY|2.0|The DVD is so dark it's unwatchable. The retrieving of the sword scene was completely dark. It was like watching a movie with the sound only. I have waited and waited for this, but instead of getting to enjoy it, it was so DARK I couldn't see anything. Even the daylight scenes were underexposed. I am extremely disappointed. NOT in the movie but in the absolutely dreadfully unacceptable quality of the DVD. I understand I am not the only one having this issue. LOVE the movie, hate the DVD. I am returning it tomorrow. : (
B0034G4OUY|2.0|Finally after seemingly being stuck in kid movies working for \\"The House of Mouse\\", Dwayne Johnson returns to his action roots with \\"Faster\\".    \\"Faster\\" is the story of a man known as Driver (Dwayne Johnson), who upon being released from prison after serving ten years for a bank robbery instantly embarks upon a killing spree. However, these murders though seemingly random at first, are soon revealed to be linked to a tragic event ten years ago when Driver's older brother was murdered before his very eyes. Now, the only thing standing between Driver and those responsible for his pain is a burnt out cop (Billy Bob Thornton) and his temporary partner (Carla Gugino), and an assassin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) hired to kill him.    Prior to watching this film I was anxious to see it simply for the fact that Dwayne Johnson is back in his action element. No more of the cutesy, kid-friendly fare that he'd been saddled with by Disney for the last few years. However, when watching the movie unfold, my feelings toward the film were fast becoming muddled by the proceedings.    Sure, Dwayne was kicking butt and taking names in a way harkening back to the hard-hitting action flicks of the eighties and nineties (or even last year's \\"The Expendables\\" for that matter), which was fun for a little while. However, the movie quickly started feeling like the action was the only thing attempting to hold everything together.    The problem was that the story was unbelievably thin, to the point of being nearly non-existent in fact. Just to be clear, this is not to say that I was expecting Oscar caliber storytelling by any means. I just think that there should have been enough going on to at least carry the movie and keep my attention for the 90 minute duration. Apparently, these \\"lofty\\" expectations were too high for this film, and I found myself becoming bored after approximately twenty minutes.    To make matters worse, the film's action scenes were surprisingly repetitive after the first two or three kills. Sure, there were a couple that broke up the monotony, but for the most part Driver dispatches his deadly brand of revenge/justice in the same expedient manner every time. At first this callous and swift approach was startling and unexpected, but soon I was wishing for some variety and more excitement.    With this sort of bare-bones approach combined with the repetitive nature of the action sequences, I should have known the story written by Tony Gayton (\\"Murder By Numbers\\") and Joe Gayton (\\"Bulletproof\\") was going to be weak from the get-go. However, I tried to keep an open mind and just enjoy it for the brainless entertainment that it was, but even that wasn't enough to save this movie.    Now, as I've mentioned already, the main star in this lackluster actioner is Dwayne Johnson. For an actor making his return to his roots (so to speak) this would seem the ideal role; after all, there's not much for him to do other than be violent.    The problem with this is that Dwayne has proven in previous films that he has acting chops and can bring much more to a character besides hulking mass. To me, while I had hoped this film would cement his return to action hero status, which it did in some respects, it also felt like a step backwards as the role seemed like a walk in the park that could have gone to a lesser talent.    Alongside Dwayne is another actor who was wasted in the role literally and figuratively (his character's an addict) is Billy Bob Thornton (\\"Monster's Ball\\"). While I'm no fan of Billy Bob's by any means, I do recognize that he is a very good actor all the same. But his role here is clichéd and boring, and it appears that Billy Bob felt the same way, because I thought he was really phoning in his performance every step of the way.    Lastly, actress Carla Gugino (\\"Sin City\\") and actor Oliver Jackson-Cohen (\\"Going the Distance\\") attempt to bring more to their painfully stereotypical roles of the female detective desperate to prove herself and an assassin that doesn't enjoy his work, respectively. However, as with their fellow cookie-cutter cut-out characters portrayed by Dwayne and Billy Bob, these two were given characters with nothing more than unoriginality to work with. So, no matter how hard they tried; their efforts were never enough to overcome the drivel on display.    Now, while on the topic of the cast, I have a couple of thoughts as to why they all signed on to this ill-fated project.    I'm sure the appeal to work on what could have been a very successful action film, especially one that would hardly be considered taxing on their dramatic talents, would be enticing for any actor or actress looking for an easy payday. But the least these cast members could have done was make sure the material was worthy of their attention, which it clearly was not.    In closing, as you have no doubt surmised, this movie was an utter disappointment. The only bright point for the film is the fact that Dwayne Johnson was back in his element. \\"Faster\\" is filled with missed opportunities, unoriginality, repetition, and above all, boredom.    \\"Faster\\" is rated R for violence, language, and brief drug use.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Reading this book gave me the illusion that Tina herself was standing there reading to me.  Her voice and wit really come through.  I finished the book in two sittings.  It is a very easy and light-hearted read.  I really want to hear more Don Fey stories!  If you are a fan of 30 Rock or Tina Fey, I don't know how this book could disappoint you!
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|First, I am so glad to see all the positive reviews for this album.  I have liked Foo Fighters since their first album even though I do not own all of their albums.  I own their first three albums but have heard all of their albums.  I decided to purchase this album not just because \\"Rope\\" being a great song but when they previewed the whole album online.  I decided to give it a try and I loved it instantly!  In my opinion, their first two albums were the best and now I can say that this is right up there with them.  Maybe I can say that this is possibly their best work to date?  I will say that it is their first album I can listen to without skipping a track since their first self titled album meaning that it's their most consistent.  That is how good this is.  My favorite tracks are \\"Bridge Burning\\", \\"Rope\\", \\"White Limo\\", \\"Arlandria\\", \\"Back & Forth\\", \\"Miss The Misery\\"...I might as well have listed all of them.  If you were like me and own their first two or three albums and liked some songs off their albums after those, then give this one a try.  It's worth it and you'd be surprised!  So far this album, ABIII by Alter Bridge, and Until We Have Faces by Red are my favorite albums this year.
0385340540|4.0|I enjoyed reading it. In fact, I read it twice (forgot I had read it two years ago).That tells you something. I have never forgotten I have read a Grisham book before, so this one was less than memorable.<br /><br />I found it easy to put the book down and take a break from reading it and that it not a good sign with a Grisham book. It lacked thrillerism (again my word not a real word)-no real suspense where the character was in perceived danger. On the other hand, I found myself hypnotized by Grishams portrayal of Bologna and the broker himself. If you are learning to speak Italian his frequent dialogue of Italian and then the English translation in small conversations and thoughts can be a huge study aid.<br /><br />The Broker was entertaining and I have since recommended it to several friends who wish to get a feel for Bologna, speaking Italian or Italy itself. Who knows I may even read it again...LOL<br /><br />Sam Hendricks, author Fantasy Football Guidebook [[ASIN:0982428650 Fantasy Football Guidebook: Your Comprehensive Guide to Playing Fantasy Football (2nd Edition)]] and Fantasy Baseball for Beginners [[ASIN:0982428693 Fantasy Baseball for Beginners: The Ultimate \\"How-to\\" Guide]]
0756404738|4.0|I just finished the book, and I am reflecting on whether I liked it or not, and the obvious answer is...yes. I have read many reviews that state that this book is boring and pompous, and that not much happens. I would agree that the overall plot does not move too much, but I was thoroughly entertained throughout all 990 pages, and at no time felt the book was wasting my time. Are there slow parts? Yes, as with the first novel, but the entertaining parts far exceed, the \\"not-so\\" entertaining parts. I love that the chapters are short, and easy to read, but I do wish the plot moved more in the present time. This book does spend most of its time in the \\"autobiography\\" section, and Rothfuss does write young Kvothe's story very well.  Kvothe can be a tiny bit overdone at times though. He sometimes seems WAY too good at EVERYTHING, but you can't help but be interested in his story. The ending of the book does leave you wanting more, just as the first one did, but the cliff-hanger in the second book does seem like it was tacked on for just that very reason. Overall a great read. If you read the first one, you have to read this anyway, but if you haven't, you should still read both.

B004LUS390|5.0|This is by far one of the best apps I've ever downloaded.  For every one talking about the update, mine did the same thing.  I uninstalled, and reinstalled and every thing was fine.  I think it's more of a phone mistake than the developers.  People I know have this app, and they had no problem updating.

B004FRX0MY|4.0|I have a new Droid X, & I have been kind of cranky because, one, I'm not that familiar with the phone, & two, trying to figure out this app was just making me nuts. After 3 or 4 days, I was much more familiar with the phone. I discovered, by accident, that some things opened under my finger that I didn't think were \\"touch\\" spots. Who knew?<br />Once I figured that out, I started touching more of the icons and words in the Amazon MP3 Cloudplayer window, which opened things I didn't expect  to open. There's no *PING* light bulb over my head, by any means. But it was a valuable experience.<br />I can't say that it's terribly intuitive; it's not. It just takes messing around with this app to get more familiar with it - the more you use it, the more things you discover.<br />In fact, right now I am listening to a song by Billy Joel. But when I was trying to show my daughter how this player system works, it wouldn't do exactly what I wanted, the way I thought it would. Poo.<br />After years of iTunes, it's just going to be a matter of learning a new system. I just hope Cloudplayer is more reliable about maintaining the catalogue of songs I've purchased through this app - so I can download them again in case of catastrophe. iTunes really completely failed to do that, despite their reassurances all your purchased music could be retrieved. I just hope Amazon's Cloudplayer system actually works in that respect. Hopefully I'll never have to find out.<br />Now, I'm going to figure out how to get music from my MacBook Pro's iTunes to migrate to my Droid X, and into Cloudplayer. (If you hear screaming, it's just me, but I'll tap something that looks suspicious, & maybe that will do the trick. At least that's my evil plan...)

193659403X|4.0|He has many followers. From Marple to Millhone, from Rebus to Rockford, from Scarpetta to the Scooby Gang. When it comes to the sciences of investigation, detection and deduction, Sherlock Holmes is the original, and still the best.<br /><br />In 'The Hound of the Baskervilles,' we see the reason for this - both in his unforgettable presence, and his unfortunate absence.<br /><br />We see in the first few pages how the presence of Holmes drives the story forward, unrelentingly and entertainingly, as Holmes poses his cohort Dr. Watson with a question about an old cane left mysteriously in their Baker Street home office. Watson deduces an answer that delights Holmes - because it is \\"almost wholly wrong\\" - but pushed Holmes' own thoughts in the right direction. This is the epitome of Holmes as a character, like a Dr. House for the 19th Century: intelligent, cunning, excitable, egotistical, funny, determined, stubborn, with just enough mean spirit to keep it interesting.<br /><br />Arthur Conan Doyle brings all these traits to bear in the mystery that unfolds from the old cane in the office - the fearful hound that seems to be hunting the Baskerville clan to extinction. Starting with the old family legend of Hugo Baskerville but straight into Holmes' present-day with the recent death of Sir Charles Baskerville under mysterious circumstances. The ancient hound is still said to be prowling the moor, and Sir Charles has seemingly died of pure terror, leaving Henry Baskerville the last surviving heir. Holmes' task is to solve the mystery of the hound and keep Henry alive, the tale of which is, as always told to us through the eyes and ears of Dr. Watson, Holmes' constant companion.<br /><br />Which brings us to the only problem with 'Hound of the Baskervilles.' For a time, about the middle third of the book, Holmes is absent from the story, and we are left to the narrative of Watson's own investigations into the matter. Watson is a fine and intelligent man, but he lacks the personality and ingenuity of Holmes. Simply put, without Sherlock Holmes front and center, the driving force and much of the fun of the story are gone with him. These chapters seem to drag slowly compared to to Holmes' breakneck pace.  This uneven pacing is an unfortunate flaw in an otherwise flawless story.<br /><br />But when Holmes makes his surprising return to the tale, he takes off at a gallop and never slows down until the end, leaving the reader gasping to catch up. The satisfying conclusion makes up considerably for the slower middle.<br /><br />Truly, Doyle's tales of mystery are as much about the character of Sherlock Holmes as they are about his cases. He exerts his presence and his influence throughout the book, and steals the stage with every quip. As we see in 'Hound of the Baskervilles,' without him, it's just a mystery.

B00005A8MA|5.0|As with all Johny Mayall albums he has always included the best of the best when it comes to lead guitar. This album has John teamed up with Eric Clapton and Mick Taylor on many of the songs.This in my estimation is one of Mayall's best efforts and a very under appreciated album.  After this album was made Mike Taylor joined the Rolling Stones and provided the lead and slide guitar work on Let it Bleed, Exile on Mainstreet, Beggers Banquet and a few others before he quit the Stones.    Back to the Roots is loaded with great talent and great songs, one of my all time favorits albums.

I have purchased re wrapped DVDs from the market place here sold as new..but never from Amazon..    I WANT TO BE CLEAR..I'm NOT saying this is the case..I just have no other explanation.    Blu-ray itself is worth the price..nice extras and pretty good HD pic..Tough for this movie due to way it was filmed..but the best it will probably ever look..
B0002F6AH0|5.0|outstanding, first class documentary series, albeit a little dated in content. the one tiny complaint i have is the lack of subtitles; some of the interview subjects have very thick accents & with the lack of remastered audio, it gets difficult to understand what's being said.
0894803123|5.0|A must have for anyone who makes home made ice-cream!!! It's got great, easy recipes, and I love how the book explains how much fat content is in different dairy products (whole milk, light cream, heavy cream, etc.) and how this is important to making an awesome batch of ice-cream. We've tried a number of recipes, and they have all come out fantastic!
B002BJGYV2|1.0|The seller mailed this to me within 5 days, and for that, I was thankful.  However, the DVDs for the seasons of Gilmore Girls I bought were 1) in completely different casings than the originals should be (making me wonder if they were even original DVDs to begin with and maybe were copied instead) and the REPLACEMENT case was even broken! 2) the DVDs did not all work.  One, in fact, could not even be watched half-way through because of the extensive damage of the DVD (all on the first attempt to watch them).  This is EXTREMELY disappointing and unacceptable as I purchased the DVDs under the marked condition of \\"very good,\\" which to me indicates a product that works properly and can be used for its intended purpose but is not in \\"brand new\\" condition.  I am very disappointed in this sale and will not be purchasing again.

0783226888|5.0|Bruce Willis absolutely scared the hell out of me in this story. He has no emotion, no feeling. I doubt he even has blood in his veins. He is 1000% cold, cool, calculating, lethal. He is a monster. He might as well have scales under his skin and yet he's calm, professional, dignified and even courteous. That's his act. That's how he makes you think that he's human, but he's not.  The only thing scarier than Bruce Willis in this is the idea that there may be people like this in real life. Pray you never cross their path.
1439102813|5.0|Absolutely heartbreaking and terrifying. I've always heard about the tragedy of Alzheimer's on its victims and their loved ones but have never had such a close look at a first-person account. The thought of slowly losing your mind is horrifying enough without knowing beforehand what is coming for you. And that's exactly what happens with Alice.<br /><br />When Alice starts having trouble, forgetting where she lives and completely missing flights to important conferences, she knows something is going on. She assumes it has something to do with menopause but soon finds out that this is not the case. She has early-onset Alzheimer's at the age of 50.<br /><br />And if anyone can put up a fight, it's Alice. She is an extremely gifted and loved Harvard professor dealing in cognitive psychology and linguistics. She tries to hang on to her regular daily life as long as she can. And she has a back up plan for when things get too bad. She makes a list of five questions to answer. If the day comes when she is unable to answer them, there are instructions for her to follow. But Alice does not realize how bad things will get and that by the time she can no longer answer the questions, she will be unable to even follow simple instructions.<br /><br />Reading Alice's view of what she was going through and thinking was just so sad. And the different ways her children and husband choose to handle her and her illness, causes conflicts. I think the most terrifying thing about the book is the possibility that this could happen to anyone and there is no cure.<br /><br />Though it is sad, I think it's a very important read to help people understand what the victim is going through, ways we may help, and the hardships and grief suffered by the family when dealing with the death of someone they knew who is actually still alive. The story has stuck with me for quite a while and I will certainly never forget it.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|WORST Madonna CD MADE -- used price of one cent proves it!!!  -------------------------------------------------------  Sorry---but when the value of a Madonna CD is 1 cent it is crap.  Go buy a good album for 1 cent like SPICE GIRLS and get some at least listenable fun music.  This CD is boring and dull.
B0000028VT|5.0|Her third CD brought her back closer to her debut CD. Though like the her second CD this one should have had a few more songs on it. It too needed another great dance song that should have been a single. And as for other songs that should have been released to radio I love \\" All I've ever wanted\\" and \\"Just to hold you once again\\"   Both simple beautiful ballads and all part of my wish for Mariah to have the most #1 songs of all time!!!! What could have been if the label would have spent a little more time in the early stages when she could do no wrong!!! This is a must have CD for everyone!!!!

0756404738|3.0|I do enjoy the writing style, however there was not a lot to get excited about in this book.  Have to agree with other reviewers that the last 100 pages were pretty much a skim.  Hopefully the next in the series can provide a little more action.  Otherwise, listening to the wind is a more entertaining alternative.
B0029LHWFO|1.0|\\"Dreams from my Father\\" is a depressing, disturbing work, one that presents a bleak and hopeless vision of America's future. Barack Obama's memoir hinges on the premise that defeating racism depends upon white people understanding black people, and that white people can never understand black people. If that's true, we as Americans are doomed to never having any sense of brotherhood or common cultural ground that crosses the racial divide, and we might as well acknowledge that blacks are all filled with rage and have highly justified reasons for despising whites. Another point Obama takes pains to underline is that biracial/multicultural identity does not exist, and people who have mixed-race ancestry are angry, miserable and emotionally messed up because of their forebears' decision to intermarry.<br /><br />Buying into Obama's segregationist policies means that every black/biracial person I have ever met has treated me with calculated deceit. I refuse to believe that.  Therefore, I reject his philosophy.<br /><br />Barack Obama is not a person I can relate to on any level.<br /><br />He's a complete narcissist, and reading some passages was an uncomfortable experience (like watching someone pleasure himself while gazing into a mirror). I do wonder if he remains at this level of an angst-ridden adolescent. This book came out when he was an adult (note: I read the edition which came out after his election to the senate, but the manuscript was published a few years prior to that, after he and Michele married) so it's entirely possible he's in some state of arrested development.<br /><br />Obama traces his life from childhood in Hawaii through his college years and eventually to his visit to Africa.<br /><br />Obama's mother was an unstable, flighty girl who, as a college kid in Hawaii, hauled home an African classmate. Barack Senior had a wife and kids back home in Kenya, but that didn't stop him from impregnating Barack's mom, and then committing bigamy by marrying her. Her white Midwestern parents (her dad had a weird fixation with black people and seeks out their company all his life) embraced their new son-in-law, although Obama pere is revealed to be an alcoholic philanderer who was officious, abusive and delusional, and who ultimately abandoned his American wife and little Barry. (The dad's multiple marriages in Africa overlap, and he discards families like expired produce--it's very sad and confusing.)<br /><br />Obama has described his maternal grandmother as racist, and he includes a passage where, close to retirement but still working to pay his tuition, she is menaced by a black street person while waiting for a bus. Her husband and her grandson Barack react with outrage. But not at the guy threatening her. At HER--for mentioning that the man who harassed her was black.<br /><br />In fact, his mom and her parents worked diligently to expose him to heroes of the Civil Rights movement, and they idealized his African heritage. I think that's why Obama resents white people. He lived with whites and saw them as \\"real\\" people, while blacks were elevated to a superhuman status. Unfortunately, maturity never brought the insight that people are people.<br /><br />Mom took him to Indonesia for her marriage #2, and this prevented him from becoming \\"a boorish American.\\" (Oh, really? Just one among many slams against the United States. I am surprised he wants to live in, much less run, this country.) He soon returns to the only stability he knows-- his doting grandparents who struggle to provide a middle-class upbringing and the opportunity to attend an exclusive private school. Bad call: he's spoiled and talks about envying rich classmates. He fights, he parties. He wallows in his perceived status as an outsider. Later, as a college student, he drinks heavily, smokes pot and snorts coke. (But never, he is proud to point out, tries heroin.) You may say, \\"Well, everyone that age experiments a little!\\" but there's a difference between that and being a burnout.  He's eventually radicalized, and although he takes a job at a law firm (he calls this \\"working for the enemy\\"), he quits with some vague idea of becoming an activist.<br /><br />On the South Side of Chicago he becomes a community organizer. Then the story gets really sketchy.  Obama lived at my former (now closed) parish. He never mentions this, and he is derisive of the priests who were actually doing community service. Natch: they're white and therefore can't relate to black people. He implies that he's nobly toiling alone for the Greater Good, when in fact he was supported by the very people he dismisses. Frankly, despite moving in the same circles for several years, living in the same neighborhood and volunteering for some of the same social outreach programs, I never once heard his name mentioned. He made no impact--he even admits this when he returns to the neighborhood after grad school.<br /><br />But his disloyalty doesn't end with his treatment of his grandparents, his mentors, and his nation, it extends to Reverend Jeremiah Wright. Wright welcomes him into his church, provides spiritual grounding, and eventually marries Obama and his wife. Obama speaks glowingly of Wright in this book...but the book was written when Wright was USEFUL to Obama. A few years later, after some of Wright's more controversial statements were publicized, Obama does what he does best and throws Wright under the bus, too.<br /><br />Obama devotes a section of the book to his pilgrimage to Kenya, where he meets dad's side of the family. Kenya, as we know, is no stranger to ethnic violence that often claims lives around election time, and it's not black-vs.-white--it's Luo vs. Bantu vs. Masai vs. Kikuyu.  Of course, until the European colonialists arrived, the Luo lived a utopic existence marred only by forced abductions, female circumcision, and wife beatings. We have to overlook the fact that East Africa was first invaded by Arab slave traders who forced many of the tribes to accept Islam, or that the dastardly European colonialists also worked to illegalize slavery. That doesn't fit with the narrative.<br /><br />But African life is no cakewalk. Obama describes endemic poverty, illiteracy, rampant corruption and poor health care. His male relatives seem singularly self-absorbed, while the long-suffering women appear more stable. Obama learns that his grandfather tried Christianity for awhile, but \\"could not understand such concepts as mercy toward one's enemies, so he converted to Islam.\\" Needless to say, Barack's visit abroad engenders no appreciation of the U.S., although he ultimately returns.<br /><br />Obama never cogently explains why he decided to go into public service or how he expects to accomplish his (ill-defined) goals. Someone once described him as \\"an empty suit.\\" The author of this book certainly fits that bill.<br /><br />Obama's presidency was lauded by many as heralding a post-racist society, but the man who wrote this book hasn't, and will probably never, transcend the simplistic and demeaning ethnic limitations he invests in.<br /><br />There has been an ongoing controversy over whether Obama wrote this memoir or if it was written by his pal Bill Ayers. It is similar enough in style to Ayers's \\"Days of Rage\\" that this is certainly a plausible theory. But Obama, again, displays an astounding disloyalty to another person who made him who he is today. Either Ayers wrote the book, heavily edited (re-wrote) it, or inspired it. No matter which, it is ungentlemanly behavior to not credit Ayers at all.<br /><br />Nevertheless, \\"Dreams\\" is regarded as a book that represents Obama. All voting Americans should read it. We should have read it before the last election, and we should have all paid attention to its cynical and self-serving message.ized, and although he takes a job at a law firm (he calls this \\"working for the enemy\\"), he quits with some vague idea of becoming an activist.

1401216676|4.0|Ended up enjoying the book alot. But at the same time heard so many good things about it I found my self pretty Dissapointed with it. It was a very good read but by no means is it a be all end joker novel like some would suggest.
B000L43AN4|5.0|Waits cracks me up on one song, tickles my medulla oblongata on another, and reduces me to a blubbering mess on another. Waits belong with Dylan and Neil Young as three of the greatest composers of the last one hundred years. Needless to say, I highly recommend this collection along with the rest of his catalog. A true American original.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|I got this in the mail the afternoon of April 14th. I was so excited to have gotten it early, I rushed home to watch it. I was incredibly mad, however, at the quality and packaging of the film. On the plastic covering, it said that the DVD was made in Mexico. And the quality sucked. It was not clear and was slightly pixilated at certain points. The movie itself is amazing, just not the DVD. Plus, it only had 5 deleted scenes, and no other special features! That was dissapointing. It had:<br />15. The Dursley House<br />16. Dudley and Harry<br />83. Ministry of Magic Lifts<br />89. Tent<br />and<br />108. Ron and Hermione Skimming Stones
0756404738|4.0|This is a long book but if you like to read like I do the length is a great way to share the characters lives as you read. The length give the author time to write about characters that doesn't necessarily move the plot along. That is the case with this book. You seem to spend a lot of time with the main character as he goes about his life. Very well written and enjoyable from start to finish but was not as good as the first book. I definitely recommend this book but be prepared to read for the fun of it and not just to push the plot along.
0316056863|5.0|For all of you that are wondering \\" Who was the guy with the arms  that posed and modeled for the Tina Fey Book  \\"Bossy Pants\\"  His name is Joe Rosario. He is a new York based character actor and director   . ( Look him up on IMDB)  He has posed for this type of shoot before with the same photographer  that shoot the  cover.  It looks GREAT!!!!
B004SS0884|3.0|This album is decent. There are a few good songs, but the majority really isn't very original. I'm REALLY not sure where all these 5 and 4 star ratings are coming from. WHY are all these staunch Brittany loyalists Singing the praises of an album that she seemingly had nothing to do with? I can't help but roll my eyes at review after review claiming that this is her \\"BEST WORK YET!!!!\\"      I've been a Brittany fan since day one and it's sad to see one of the pioneers phoning it in like this and even sadder when the fans deny it. I don't blame the studio for wanting to appeal to the ke$ha/Gaga audience but honestly if you're going to imitate a style then you need to built upon it and make it your own NOT just create a rip off that sounds WORSE than the source material. At least gaga and kesha will give you a beat to dance to. Most of this album's songs had lots of gimmick but no real style or originality.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Pre-ordered product on the 11th and recived the item 2 days after album was released on the 14th; my husband was stoked that he recieved a portion of the tape that the Foo Fighters originally recorded the album on inside the album sleeve. Awsome service as always Amazon!!
B004WMKSH2|2.0|Not my favorite Harry Potter movie and is definitely NOT for young children. Dark theme with very few light moments. Is there any reason why the final book couldn't be covered in one movie? I anticipated greatness but feel extremely disappointed eventhough I read the book. Did the 48 hour rental bit and thankful I waited to see it. If I'd seen it in a theater, I'd want a refund. Gave it 2 stars(1.5 for actors and .5 for movie) because I've become a fan of some of the actors and not because it's a good movie. The cast did a great job with the poor script they were given. If a 1.5 star was available, that would be my rating. I'll watch the final one only after it's video release. Hoping it's better than this one.
1936041111|5.0|This classic by Mary Shelley was one of my favorites as a teenager.  After re-reading it, I still feel the same.  This book is the story of Dr. Frankenstein and the monster that he created.  Immediately repulsed, Dr. Frankenstein rejects the monster, leaving it to roam Europe on its own.  After hiding near a family, the monster learns how to talk and communicate and realizes that he is missing companionship.  When Dr. Frankenstein refuses to create a companion for him, the monster begins killing his family.  Overall, this is a book well worth reading.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Great movie! Christina Aguilera was awesome!! I can watch it over and over again. The music and dancing was magnificent.
1594202842|4.0|I know this may sound a little vain, but I don't see how this would be a must read for the childless. With that said, and I a father of two girls, I found it extremely enlightening and honest. The easiest way for me to sum up the book I guess is to say that it paints a very clear distinction between Western and Chinese parents. Hard not to question the expectations you put on your children after reading this book but in the end yields to cation as to how hard you push.

B003Q6D25K|2.0|I haven't laughed this hard since the Hangover.  The producers wasted an opportunity to make a decent movie by wasting the first 55 minutes and then making the rest so laughable I couldn't take it seriously.<br /><br />If you DO choose to see this, skip the 56 minute mark and enjoy the laughs.
0896898288|5.0|I looked at this book and thought WOW! .. This book has inspired me to recreate the Farmer's Wife Sampler Quilt.  The stories behind each block has given me the need to make my own version. I have only had the book for a couple of weeks, and have already made all of the templates, and rummaged through my stash for suitable fabrics to do the project justice. I know I will be so pleased with the result, and am getting to 'know' each of the farmer's wives as I go. Fantastic book .. Thankyou Amazon.
1439102724|1.0|How did this book ever get on the best seller list??? It is trite and poorly written...I want my money back!
1569242739|5.0|I've made quite a few cupcakes from this book and they all turned out wonderful. I have to say that so far the banana was my favorite! I'm making them for my 2yr olds birthday party! Totally worth every penny!
B0009MWAVQ|5.0|This set is a major investment, but one that is well worth making. It contains 34 CDs of truly wonderful music, superbly played. Scarlatti's 555 keyboard sonatas form a remarkable and very rewarding body of work and they are immensely varied - passionate, serene, humorous... every mood or emotion you could think of is here somewhere. I never tire of them, and always find something fresh and new when I listen to them.<br /><br />You do need to like the harpsichord if you're going to buy this set. I certainly do, and especially when it is played as well as this. These recordings by Ross are regarded as landmarks by many, and I wouldn't argue with that. His playing is technically brilliant, and he brings out all the variety in these amazing pieces. What also shines through is his sheer love for the music - every single sonata is played as though it really means something and he makes this monumental compendium a pleasure from start to finish.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this set too highly. I have owned and loved the original Erato discs for years and still play them regularly and with immense pleasure. It is a set to last a lifetime and if you have any interest in baroque music or the keyboard in general, I urge you to give it a try.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I thought the original Angry Birds was the best game around for smartphones. They improved it with better graphics and no ads! Only negative is that I wish there were more levels. I guess I will just have to wait until the next Update in May. Thanks, Rovio!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|The acting was excellent, female lead was Ruth Wilson, Male lead was Toby Stephens.  Story line excellent and stayed fairly close to the book.  Photography very good w/ beautiful scenry.  Furnishings and clothing looked quite authentic.  The music was exceptional, I loved it.  I did have a tough time occasionally with the accents.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|I loved this book soo much! I really enjoyed how she connected the dots of how high school was so difficult for her. I really hated how some of those boys treated her! How gross.... but I loved how the author blended the stories in to one sad story.It's a wonderful read on how a teenage girl was not treated like a human, but instead, like an object.
B004MPEFBE|5.0|I loved this movie. The kids' acting is really good, the scenes are great, I loved the cinematography too. Masterfully built together. I wish they could do 3 instead of 2 parts and fit in all the other important moments that Rowling had in the book. Honestly though, I did not want it to end. It's beautifully dark, faithful to the book, the acting is so mature now, and I can't wait to see the last installment. I enjoyed every bit of it!
B000002LEM|3.0|If your a Van Halen fan this wouldn't be a bad album to purchase. If you're looking for something to blow your mind or really to see what Van Halen's all about I wouldn't suggest it.
B0049JPU8A|5.0|Recent convert to The Script after seeing them on SNL and David Letterman- good group and the Science & Faith CD is excellent! Thoroughly enjoy their music and not a bad song on this CD.
B0025KVLTC|4.0|Never a dull moment in this album. A lot of great songs that many people would know and even the songs you haven't heard of you need to hear.
B0034G4OXQ|3.0|We have three separate human interest stories taking place in three distant locations here. I thought the stories were going to prove to have some sort of clever, complex connection, a la the disparate stories in \\"Crash.\\" But the \\"Hereafter\\" is a let-down on that score. Characters from the three different subplots do end up crossing paths, but their final encounter turns out to be more a matter of geographical coincidence than anything integral to their back stories.    The common thread of these stories is supposed to be a quest into the nature of the afterlife. But the consequences of each character's questioning turns out to be - inconsequential.    Matt Damon plays a true psychic who rather vehemently and inexplicably refuses to give readings anymore, even to the point of slamming the door on a bereaved mother who desperately wants to make contact with her recently deceased child. Damon doesn't give any sufficient reason for giving up his work as a psychic and becoming a construction worker instead. He mumbles something about not wanting to live with death all the time. But this denial of his \\"gift\\" seems essentially inexplicable and perverse. His budding romance with a young woman who might have made some sense of it all evaporates into thin air. Her sudden defection from the San Francisco cooking class where they met is not sufficiently explained. She's just in the picture one minute - and gone the next.    Then when the Damon character does relent and gives a psychic reading, the kinds of communications he extracts from the beyond are inane. \\"She wants you to be happy and remarry.\\" \\"He says this weightless thing is really cool.\\" Why would the departed wrench themselves from the spirit world simply to convey such banalities? And why would the living find such comfort in these pronouncements, other than seeing in them a reassurance that their loved one still does exist somewhere, in however tedious a frame of mind?    The theme of the Hereafter rests on one further bit of illogic. When the French investigative reporter whose life is featured in the first vignette nearly dies in the tsunami that hit Thailand - we see her near-death experience as consisting only of the sighting of vague, filmy characters lined up like stelae, reaching out to her from some cloudy afterworld. However when she revives, she says the experience changed her life. Why would it?    Each of the three vignettes is very well-acted, and would actually have stood on its own terms as an absorbing, low-key insight into the everyday life of a distinctive personality. There's the French news anchor living a very Parisienne life. There are identical twin brothers living with a heart-warmingly dysfunctional/functional mother in England. Then there's Damon's psychic character turning his back on his visions. We see details of each life and each setting that draw us into personal knowledge of the individuals, like well-written essays draw us into a feeling of personal acquaintanceship with the authors.    But the attempt to unite these separate lives with the overarching theme of life-after-death proves to be a bit too forced. The keystone of the Hereafter is just too weak to brace this film into anything substantial and long-standing.
B000000OQY|4.0|The first half of the album are songs that they sing at live shows. The other half of the album is acoustic. It's all pretty solid. They cover Aerosmith's Mama Kin. The acoustic side is what I'd prefer to listen to mainly because the song Patience.
B004FHBO9K|1.0|How can clear vinyl sound so bad? I expected better sound quality than the CD recording.  Clear vinyl is supposedly quieter than black vinyl, according to various audiophiles. Not in this case.  All sides of the 2 LP clear vinyl pressing are noisy - cracks, surface noise, loud pops. I have 20+ year old  ordinary black vinyl records that are quieter.  Maybe I received the clear vinyl equivalent of a lemon.
B000000OSE|3.0|This album has a lot of ups and downs. I rarely ever play it all the way through. They have quite a few hits on this album such as Live and Let Die, November Rain, Don't Cry, and a few others. The most underrated song as this album would be the final track Coma.
B0043EV774|5.0|This is a great combo package.  DVD Blue Ray... digital copy... what more can you ask for.  This is a great seller, package received in new condition and works great. thanks... I would do business with you again.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|This movie was amazing!  It is action packed and a beautiful movie.  The movie is part 1 of the last book and has such a great cliffhanger that it is sad when the movie ends, I cannot wait to see the next movie!!!  --I do not want to give anything away (it is hard to talk about this movie without giving away an important aspect).<br /><br />On another note, the movie looks great in HD, but they left such large bars at the top and the bottom of the screen.  It is not bad, but it is like the old days when you would watch a Widescreen movie on a full screen unit.<br /><br />I have a question about what the special features (mainly the trailer for the next movie) are...  After watching the movie on the  \\"Movie: Blu-Ray\\" disk, I went to Special Features and there was only an option for watching the movie in different manners.  I put the second disk \\"Special Features: Blu-Ray\\" in and it loaded and went to the main menu, but there was no option except Language and Special Features (which had no options other than language and subtitles).  It was strange, because the player would not move normal, I had to use inverted controls to move.<br /><br />In all this was a great movie, and a must watch, I was hoping to see the trailer for the new movie, however, I guess it is time to start surfing the net looking for it myself.  :)
B004LSJCJM|5.0|Joe knows how to tell a story and how to weave the music into a lightening bold flame.  The story of being held captive, whether it is in a dieing, dried up dust bowl of a town; or a dust bowl of a heart.  Love lost, life's arrows; bleeding blues in track #4.  I highly recommend this to all JB fans both old and new.
0307271862|3.0|I looked forward to reading this, my first Mankell book, after having seen the Wallander series on PBS.  Sad to say, I found the book to be only okay.  While the beginning of the story really grabbed me, Mankell then began to wander all over the place.  He introduced a second story line that a) I felt got very bogged down, and b) whose relationship to the primary plot was difficult to discern even 5 pages from the end!  There were interesting characters who appeared to be important in the beginning of the story yet faded into oblivion later on.    I just felt the book lost focus.  I am trying to not give away too much of the story line, but frankly I felt it was pretty contrived.  The rationale for the murders that happened at the start of the novel just got lost in an examination of present-day and future-day China.    I'll wait for the next PBS installment of Wallander......
B001F6TXME|5.0|You must have this for taking long exposure and bulb shots over 30 seconds. Great for astrophotography. It's also useful when using a tripod. Plug and play. Works perfectly with D3100.
B004WMKJNU|4.0|\\"Into the Dark\\" may be the best episode of the season.  Maggie Q, Lynsey Fonseca, and Shane West brought their \\"A\\" game.  Add Devon Sawa and Ray Park to the mix and you get an action packed episode that also touched the heart.  Great job by the actors and the writers for bringing this fictional world to life.
B00122Z5RI|5.0|I had this when it was an album (they were these plastic discs that tended to warp and get scratchy...Google it if the concept is confusing.)    I used to listen to it constantly. Then years went by, my musical tastes changed...I may have had it on CD but then that got forgotten too.    I just decided to download it and after immediately listening to it I'm again stunned by its brilliance and humor.    I honestly think that if this hadn't been released in the late 70's and was sealed away and only released this year people would still be shocked, outraged, and in awe of it.    It's a punk rock Sergeant Pepper's, with toe-tapping guitar riffs and sing-along, stuck-in-the-head lyrics.    Rolling Stone had it absolutely right when years and years ago they voted it as the best rock album of all time.
B0012YYZYK|5.0|i love, love, love, it.the first time i seen it i was in NYC.  It was awsome then, it is awsome now.  Color, clarity and sound are great.  I highly recommend it for any Led Zepplin fan.
0307165485|5.0|I read this fantastic book when I was a child and truly loved it!  Now I can share this collection of stories and poems with my grandchildren.  All of us love the cast of fun animal characters and the illustrations are truly amazing.  Highly recommended for children under 5 years old!
0307346617|3.0|As you should know by now the concept of the book is that the author conducts interviews with the survivors of the zombie war; politicians, soldiers and regular people. But this concept just isn't executed as well as it could be. Though each interviewee tells a fascinating story that illuminates an aspect of the global struggle that is truly original, Brooks does very little to make them really feel like interviews. Each subject speaks in flourishing prose and spins a tail right on the spot better than anyone I've ever met. They are completely candid and require no prodding from the interviewer and apparently speak perfect English (thought the interviews take place all over the world). Again the ideas are unique and the book is worth reading, it's a fun new take on the genre. But if you are easily taken out of a story when things don't add up, skip it.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|This movie was much better than I expected. I would agree it maybe a scary for younger children. No matter how good a movie is somewhere someone hated it. I just get tired of people saying how its not exactly like the book or commenting on some technical aspect no one else knows or cares about. It keeps to the basic story, has great 3D effects, and is entertaining. Certainly worth the 18 bucks I spent on a used copy, which I highly recommend cause 3D movies are expensive. Just my opinion of course.
B00475BUVM|1.0|I had big hopes for this movie in 3D. I really thought that with all the animation in this film that they would be able to create some stellar 3D effects. As it happenes, it was not all that different from watching it in 2D. I was very disappointed and suggest you skip this one.
B001BWTVN8|5.0|All,<br />  I am not sure if it is: the SHM process, the mastering, the fact that the Japanese are so anal about their manufacturing, but my god does this CD sound SO DIFFERENT! I can hear and understand Sandy Denny's voice, and what she is actually saying in the \\"Battle of Evermore\\", never could before, I can hear Bonham switching different cymbals in \\"Stairway to heaven\\", which I NEVER could hear before, they used to sound all the same, and now they are clear as a bell, and I can tell when he switches cymbals in other songs as well, and his bass drum has punch in every song that was missing before, his drumming sounded so weak. I always thought this was the most poorly mastered Zep. album when it was first made, but this is a revelation! I am hearing these great songs all over again for the first time! I am floored! Money WELL SPENT!!! It blows the LP out of the water, seriously! The 180 gm. version of this album I have. Along with EVERY CD version I have ever heard, including the recent: \\"Mothership\\" release, which I think is awful, WAY TOO LOUD!<br /><br /> Incredible CD! My system: Rotel 1500 all-in-one (combined amp/CD player), B&W 805D speakers, Kimber cables. Even on my lowly iPod, I can hear the difference, and it has a 85 cent DAC (digital audio converter) inside! My $1500 Rotel amp/CD player I assume (joking, I KNOW it cost a lot more) than the DAC in my $149.00 iPod.<br /><br />So, buy this SHM-CD! You will be amazed as well!<br /><br />David
B002JVWR4U|5.0|Dollhouse was a good thrill ride that ended too soon.  Eliza Dushku, as always, delivered an outstanding performance.  Joss Whedon was going to take the series in a great direction but because it got canceled, he had to wrap it up rapidly.  It didn't hurt the quality of the show but it did end up in a whole new direction.  I fully expect over time that it will become a classic.  And best of all, it has Eliza Dushku.  I got a rare opportunity to meet her in person and get her autograph at C2E2, the comic book convention in Chicago.  I have never met an actress who is more beautiful in person than she is on film until her.  Dollhouse is edgy escapist fun.  Enjoy.
0670022411|4.0|I couldn't finish this book.  I didn't even make it to the middle before I set it down for good.  It's just so sloooow.<br /><br />A lot of things have happened in the beginning so far.  The witch girl finds a creepy alchemy book.  We meet a sexy, protective vampire.  Vampire breaks into the witch's bedroom.  Witch has her own personal dilemma on top of the events.<br /><br />Yet, all of these events are told in the most boring way possible.  Paragraphs are wasted on mundane activities.  I know way too much about the witch's workout routine and not enough about the mysterious evil force that should have showed up long before now.  I read about the witch going on a coffee date with the hunky vampire, and all they do is talk about back story.  No emotion, no romance, no suspense, no excitement, no reason at all for me to keep flipping pages.  I finally put it down for good when the book began to detail the witch's yoga class.<br /><br />Yes.  There are several pages dedicated to a single yoga class.  Why would a book with so many cool elements waste a chapter on workout routines and yoga?  This befuddles me.<br /><br />I gave the book 4 stars anyway.  This author's writing style does not mesh with what I enjoy reading.  Yet this book has many good aspects too.  For one, it is well written.  The setting is cool.  I loved the main character.  She is interesting and strong, which I highly value.  And I'm sucker for mythological / alchemy / magic type stuff.<br /><br />But this book and I aren't made for each other.  The author's writing style is the exact opposite of my reading style.  I read through 8 chapters of back story and daily activities with tidbits of interesting stuff sprinkled in.  If a rich, slow paced novel is your thing, you will love this.
B0026OE2NY|4.0|Glenn Close provides narration for this almost two hours documentary of the earth. Each frame is easily worth a thousand words. The film spans across the globe in some popular destinations and some unknown rarely visited places. The cameras are shot at an aerial view like above in an airplane without any interruption. The film director compiled, edited, and assembled a visual masterpiece of an ode to the planet earth and a request to its viewers to save from self-destruction.    After the watching this film, you know how beautiful the earth is but you can't imagine her vulnerability to self-destruct at our own hands. Maybe this beautiful film will inspire us to protect our home planet from the dangers out there in the world. We can all come together to preserve earth for future generations.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Just wanted to throw my two cents in the ring. I'm a long-time Foo fan, and this album does not disappoint. A few songs are still growing on me (White Limo, I Should Have Known) while others were instant favorites (Walk, Miss the Misery, Dear Rosemary). Songs like Rope, Back & Forth, and Arlandria are classic Foo, through and through, and remind me why I fell in love with this band's music in the first place. In turn, tracks like Bridge Burning and A Matter of Time are reminiscent of Foo's newer sound--a sign that the band is forever growing and, I hope, not going away anytime soon!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|First of all kudos to Amazon for a very quick April 15, 2011 arrival of my shipment.     I will agree with other reviewers that the packaging for the DVD is extremely cheap. The front cover graphics look like a poor photocopy from a bad printer.  Regardless I bought the movie for the DVD itself and will not deduct points for the packaging. The DVD played just fine in my Blu-ray player.    I decided to wait until the last movie is available for purchase before going Blu-ray on the whole set. Based on other reviews about the pixelation of the Blu-ray version that turns out to be a wise bet.    There is no doubt in my mind that this movie will appeal more to the Harry Potter purists who have read every book. I have been disappointed in the later movies regarding how much important detail was omitted from the movies so it stands to reason that I am incredibly delighted with this movie. It beautifully captures the darkness of the time with gorgeous, moody landscapes, captures the draining, debilitating hopelessness Harry, Hermione and Ron feel at various points and slowly builds tension to the sudden abrupt ending.     At the time I watched Deathly Hallows Part 1 in the movie theater I was almost angry at the abrupt ending but when you look at it in context, it does allow the second movie to flow seamlessly from the first Deathly Hallows movie. So I will be watching the first movie again just prior to watching the second movie in July 2011.    The excellent attention to detail in this movie does not translate as well to the casual viewer and my younger daughter who has not read the last three books was a little lost. So I get both points of view about the decision to split the last book into two movies but I'm happy the purists won.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved this book. I have read it atleast 3 times. while your reading you feel as though you are in the story. Nicholas Sparks does a wonderful job painting the pictures in this story.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Extremely satisfied with the recent purchase of \\"Band of Brothers\\" DVD set I purchased at Amazon.  They arrived very timely, and I was completely satisfied with the NEW condition, being that they were advertised as USED.  Thank you so much for the fantastic service and a great product.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|This movie is simply my all-time favorite movie.     When I sometimes feel depressed about the world or life, I will watch this movie, and it always manages to make me feel better. Gandhi's life was so powerful, and his motives were so pure and unblemished by personal greed or gain, that it fills my whole being with a deep warmth and true happiness to be reminded that sometimes we humans are capable of such greatness.     Perhaps there are better movies to watch for entertainment, but I would suggest that no movie beats this one for portraying the best we can aspire to, and that is a very good thing.
B004LWZVZC|4.0|What I know of the search for the killers of President Abraham Lincoln comes primarily from the mesmerizing book, [[ASIN:0060518502 Manhunt]].  Mary Surratt was one of about five who were charged with conspiracy and stood trial. Never fully answering whether or not she was guilty, the film is definitely sympathetic to her.  In fact, it presents her character and her religious faith in a very respectful manner.  I found this film to be every bit as engaging as was [[ASIN:0060518502 Manhunt]].
B004GJDQT8|1.0|Once again amazon makes you jump through hoops, fill out card details and then tells you you can't download due to geographical restriction (Australia). I can download from the android market but not from amazon, join the 21st century and let any one down load from anywhere or at least advise people that they can't use it unless they live in the US. Would have given it zero stars but it wont let me.
B003UBTX72|5.0|I bought stones records as a teen and went to two concerts, now I am re-living those years. Like the day my brother bought the sticky fingers album and all the kids in the neighborhood gathered around. I am so enjoying reading this book and seeing the behind the scene life at those times. I have so much respect for keith richards now. His family seemed sort of Bohemian in a way.  I watched a concert documentary and looked at him in a new light. He is a genius, no question. He should be knighted or something.. .  rock on keef!
B004N8CP8K|5.0|I have tried a bunch of different RDP clients on tablets and smart phones. This is the easiest by far. The fact that its free and ad free is just awesome.
B001UV4XI8|1.0|A mess. Boring, non-involving and poorly acted. Note to the actors: staring off into the distance with a perpetually concerned expression does not qualify as good acting! Nor does a dark, moody atmosphere qualify for a mature movie. I'm tired of this grossly misguided philosophy that \\"dark\\" somehow equals \\"mature\\" or \\"adult\\". Anything but a mature work, HPATDH plays as if it were written by an untalented teenager, with no sense of pacing, character, or where to place emphasis.   The movie also suffers from a severe case of tonal inconsistency, mixing bad comedy with eye-rolling melodrama. And should I mention the effects? No, let's be nice. Let's just say I have the strong suspicion that most of the budget ended up in the actor's pockets.      I am amazed at how easily people are amused by this over-blown kiddie matinee.    Don't like my review? Well, tough.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|Natalie Portman, having physically trained many months for the role, masterfully portrays the tortured ballerina Nina, hell bent upon achieving perfection in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. Although the director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), has cast Nina in the lead role of the Swan--a two-sided character--he constantly taunts and berates her that she is lacking in the passion to portray the dark side of the role--The Black Swan. That Nina does have a dark side is terrifyingly true, yet her obsession with perfection has her stretched-thin psyche holding it back. It doesn't help that her greatest ally and fan is actually her controlling, smothering mother. She has a history of self-harm in the form of scratching herself without even being aware that she has done it. With all of the internal and external pressure, she begins to crack. New scratches appear. She begins to see things that are not there and imagine things that did not happen. The tension of the cut-throat atmosphere in the ballet troupe draws the viewer into the madness also. Nina's paranoia focuses on Lily, a new dancer from the west coast, and Lily becomes both her nemesis as well as her mimesis (imitator or rival). The film capitalizes on the aspects of duality in the white/black swan and the Nina/Lily dancer. Lily is not so technically polished as Nina, yet she has the freedom and enthusiasm that Lily lacks. Lily tries to, or seems to try, depending on your point of view, befriend Nina and to get her to loosen up. All the while Nina thinks that Lily is trying to take her place, and, indeed Lily is eventually assigned as understudy for the Swan and very nearly replaces her on opening night. That Nina ultimately achieves a thrillingly dark and passionate Black Swan performance means for her that she has already jumped off the precipice of sanity even before the Swan character jumps off the ledge into the hidden mattress below.
0143034901|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend of my wife's who has an interest in Spanish culture and fluency in the Spanish language. I didn't know what to expect, as I'd never heard of Carlos Ruiz Zafon and wasn't sure what this novel was about. Honestly, even after reading it, I'm still at a loss to describe the story in much detail. There's just, SO MUCH to it! The story contains a number of Faustian elements, with mysterious characters of dubious intent crossing and re-crossing paths throughout. It evokes \\"The Name of the Rose\\", with its literary references and settings in old castles and book stores. It even harkens to some Hemingway, set in mid- 20th century Spain with the overall Spanish vignettes, from cafes to buses to town squares. The first third of the book seemingly introduces two characters a page, but it is actually introducing different aspects of each character, all of which will come to mean something as the intricate plot evolves. This does require the reader to slow down and take mental notes of who is doing what, lest the reader become so lost that the details of the story get muddled or ignored. Finally, once the characters are introduced and \\"doing\\" the story, the action slackens a little in the middle as we grow closer to the characters, learn more of their foibles, and the plot slowly unfolds. The end is like any good novel: the reader is enveloped and becomes increasingly desperate to learn the fate of the young protagonist Daniel as all those around him plot and connive to spoil his happiness (and shorten his life, maybe). The writing and story are just tremendous and I especially like Zafon's crisp characterizations and witty dialog. Some of the exchanges and remarks are downright hilarious in the translated English (which is excellent and very natural - kudos to Lucia Graves on her wonderful translation), and I imagine in the native Spanish the jokes, puns, and comedic insults are side-stabbing-ly funny. The mystery that unfolds is tricky, shadowy, and at times confusing, but always definitely plausible, making it that much more scary and enjoyable. Except for the lack of pace in the second third of the book - which is more than compensated for by the speed of the opening and closing - I can't really think of a bad thing to say. This is one great read and well worthy of five stars., shadowy, and at times confusing, but always definitely plausible, making it that much more scary and enjoyable. Except for the lack of pace in the second third of the book - which is more than compensated for by the speed of the opening and closing - I can't really think of a bad thing to say.

0060899220|4.0|I've never worked in a restaurant myself, nor do I typically read non-fiction books, so this book would not normally fall on my must-read list.  However, one of my best friends (who managed a very successful restaurant for years) insisted that I had to read it.  I'm glad I did.    This was a gritty, raunchy, satisfying look into the food industry as a whole.  AB tells stories from his past experiences starting with his first love of food and following him to cullinary school and through his first jobs in the real world.  He isn't afraid to share his failures both personally and professionally.  He also isn't afraid to share some of the secrets of the kitchen.    If I remember nothing else from this book, I'll remember his instruction for when it is best to order seafood in a restaurant and when it is a bad idea.  The book is worth reading for that little bit of information alone.     I also appreciated his description of the signs of a restaurant that is starting to fail.  After reading this part of the book, I could see these signs in several places I used to go to but lost interest in.    There was certainly nothing glamorous about AB's kitchen world.  And, because I have no experience in this arena myself, I really couldn't speak to the truth of the descriptions and am simply taking his word for it.  But it was fun to read regardless.  It actually read more like a novel than non-fiction which I was happy about.  AB is very good at telling a story.    I'd recommend this book to anyone who considers him/herself a foody either professionally or as a hobby.  If you are a fan of the food network channel, and you don't mind a lot of cursing, then this book is for you.
B000OT5DHM|5.0|This book was originally purchased in the 70's and I thought it was your erogenous zones!  Well, it was an error but, the best investment!  Since then, I lost it, but had to get it back into my library!  A. sund investment.
B004KPLVV8|5.0|Hey there, what can you say about Tron but \\"Fantastic!\\".  Jeff Bridges stars as Kevin Flynn, a former computer programmer who is trying to hack into his old computer companies' data files in order to find the proof he needs to bring down Ed Dillinger, played by David Warner, who also has a dual role as Sark, his alter persona in the computer world.  As Flynn tries to crack the MCP's unbreakable codes, he zaps Flynn into the computer world through a laser that can take apart matter and place it anywhere it means to.  Flynn is forced to wander through this world and try to find a program named TRON to help him destroy the MCP and liberate the computer world from tyranny.  Tron is played by Bruce Boxleitner, also in a dual role as Alan, Tron's user who helps Flynn find the files that will prove that Dillinger stole Flynn's files as his own.  Tron is not CGI made so the special effects aren't amazing as the new Tron Legacy movie but it's still damn spectacular for what they had to work with.  The DVD is a special edition and comes with some extras such as the making of Tron, an interview with the cast, both old and new.  The trailer is also included with previews of some other movies.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|best pdf reader for Android. I Think its even better then the pc offering. easily displays large pdf files in an intelligent manner. renders really nice too.
B0000542D2|5.0|Although there are over 400 reviews of this film already on Amazon, I figured I'd add my two cents. This film, to put it bluntly, encapsulates the joy of the Beatles in one highly amusing, 90-minute package. Yes, the boys are caricatured, to an extent, but if you watch actual interviews with them, you'll see that the caricature isn't entirely fabricated. The film follows the boys through a so-called typical day that sees them arriving in London, weathering a press conference, rehearsing for a performance and, finally, performing. However, it's much more than that.     Through the dialogue, the supporting characters (who include a high-strung, compulsive producer, a naughty but \\"clean\\" grandfather, and the ever-present Norm and Shake, who represent Brian Epstein, their manager, and Mal Evans, their roadie), and the often-brilliant cinematography, we experience the innocent cheekiness that epitomized the Beatles during 1964.     If you're a Beatles fan, this is obviously a must-have. If you haven't been exposed to the Beatles, this is an excellent introduction. I challenge you to watch this and not be entirely charmed by the lads.
B004NSULHM|5.0|The album will grow in you.  And now i feel like I need more and more from this era, also, The Butcher & Supercollider are out, I Thinks that's Radiohead plan, little By little, The King Of Limbs will be fully released  PLUS  I don't know why people complain its a very short album, i mean we have actually 12 songs from this era, The King Of Limbs Album (8) These Are My Twisted Words, Harry Patch, The Butcher & Supercollider and more will, just be patient.
030746363X|5.0|I have found that this book reveals the essential truths about various aspects of physical fitness from the standpoint of a relative outsider, but with the techniques and research of an extremely successful and eloquent businessman.  The parallels to Arthur Jones' views are interesting, as each reinforces the other.  In many cases we have been brainwashed by the muscle magazines into thinking that hour and hours of training are necessary for a proper physique.  The down to earth, commonsense techniques used here are hopefully the first step to a sensible attitude towards exercise and nutrition.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in getting fit and staying fit, while creating a lifestyle.
B002ZG98LO|4.0|Enjoyable, and twisty.  As with all predator movies, the audience is placed in the shoes of the hunted, but this time it's not a team, or at least the group doesn't start as a team.  Each character is allowed to get a little of their history out in the open for the audience.  Some are still curiosities.  A few unsuspected twists add some new story drivers to the \\"Predator\\" series, making this third film a bit of a stand-alone in the trilogy.  This is not a sequal to AVP or AVP2, but a sequal to \\"Predator\\", and \\"Predator2\\", and worth adding to your collection.  4 stars because it was short, or at least I expected more maybe...
140120841X|5.0|if you're a fan of the movie, id suggest getting this Graphic novel- which is where it started at. You'll be in for a pleasant suprise at how much it fleshes everything out, not to mention, fill in the gaps. Which all of our friends who poo-poo'd the movie (\\"because its not as good as the book\\") and held the book as superior.<br /><br />I might say that i disagree with them in that.... they arent the same thing- the one is never going to be the other. Its a rare day when a book and its corresponding (or inspired) movie are both equally good. There are simply things that work in a book that dont in a movie (and vice-versa). I thought they were both very good,<br /><br />I think its spectacular- a good story, great artwork, it moves right along and easily keeps you engaged and enthralled. The color is  very nice- id just wished id of discovered this about 20 years ago. dammit. LOL.
1594202842|1.0|This is a glorified account of a bad mother's attempt to raise successful kids. Life for children is not to be endured in this way, it is about building a strong family foundation and teaching them, not forcing them to do what parents want. Yes as she says, children are an extension of their parents and we all hope for bigger and better extensions but a good parent lets them be part of the decision. It's about doing it together. This was an imposition of Mrs Chua's desires all the time. What a selfish person. I can't believe that husband of hers stayed around.    She calls her kids barbarians but she is the one yelling at them all the time, she is the barbarian. She talks about wanting them to be cultured, open minded... but I don't know any cultured well raised woman who yells like that. She is the savage uncultured person, trying so hard to be something she isn't.     It's a shame coming to America or living in America and criticizing everything about the way americans raise their kids. After all, these are opportunities she enjoyed were created by those americans she constantly belittles.      I thought I could get something out of this book but have to say, it didn't do anything for me. Mrs know it all simply thinks she is better than everybody else. There are lots of things we can learn from other cultures and the way they raise their kids. Mrs Chua should try that open mindedness she talks about and learn a bit from the american way, it's not all bad. I guess in her case it might be impossible, she knows better.     Also I felt many times like dropping the book which is no masterpiece sorry for a Harvard educated lawyer I expected a better prose.
1416550550|5.0|Once a reader adjusts to the changes of years from one chapter to the next, I found this book very compelling. The images and memories that Nell recalls are never totally forgotten.  Kate Morton's descriptive paragraphs of scenes are vivid.  The secrets and the way they are revealed keeps one reading with interest.
B002N83H52|3.0|I sometimes think I love the idea of books more than reading them.  A large library or book store makes me feel overjoyed, and when two local Borders closed down, I cried leaving each for the last time, knowing that I'd never browse their shelves.<br /><br />It is this world that is captured so well in The Man Who Loved Books Too Much (TMWLBTM) as Allison Hoover Bartlet details the world of a book sellers, book collectors, a book sleuth, and a book thief who steals not because he wants to resell, but because he loves books and what they represent, namely wealth and status.<br /><br />Bartlett frames the book as a cat and mouse game between the thief, John Gilkey, and a book seller turned amateur sleuth, Ken Sanders.  She ties together and contrasts their love of books, and provides a great introduction to the interesting world of collectible books and what they mean to us.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as the book progresses Bartlett seems to lose her way.  The book seems to be building to an ultimate showdown between Gilkey and Sanders, but instead gives us pages of Bartlett dealing with the unrepentant Gilkey visiting book stores or talking about them.  The end result is that we don't get enough of the world of collectible books to satisfy, and there isn't any real true crime story to drive the narrative.<br /><br />Still, anyone who loves books will enjoy this book enough to recommend.
B004WR2X20|1.0|Today I watched the Episode \\"Kent\\". I have never said anything bad about a single smallville episode, but this episode was just incredibly stupid. I don't understand why they needed to do another alternate universe episode. they did one and that was fine. All I got from this, was that Clark decides to sell the farm.
0553582038|2.0|It is a real shame such an excellent series has devolved to this.  Mr. Martin is an excellent writer, but he appears to have been hijacked by fame, I suppose.  I hope the HBO series catalyzes some movement in the story.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|I had no problem watching the film, the quality was really good. The characters grew up, as the readers grew up. So by the time the 7th book came out, J.K. wasnt writing for 11 year olds anymore. I grew up with Harry Potter, I read the books, and own all the films. I was not at all disappointed with the way that this film came out, and of course they had to split it up into two films. If they hadnt nothing would have made sense.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This movie has always been a classic favorte.  But now, in Blu Ray, it is simply incredible!  Just beautiful.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Absolutely went to the top of my list for album of the year.  The real gem on this CD is Set Fire to the Rain, an absolute powerhouse of a song that just builds and builds with true passion.  But, there are lots of great songs that really have a nice backbeat.  I really enjoyed the various arrangements in the songs, lots of variety makes for a refreshing, intriguing listen over and over.  Her voice is unique, almost smoky, and with some wonderful range, just when you don't expect it.  Some of the songs really bring out the very best in her voice.  This CD is this year's no-brainer.  Pick it up!
B000Q67876|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made... Everything about it is just Great!!!  and if you are Stephen King follower you will find the slight connections between this movie and Apt Pupil!  LOVE IT!!
0307719774|5.0|I've been using this journal for all of 2011 and have been enjoying it immensely. I love the structure of the journal itself, the hard cover and petite size of the journal make it easy to store, but it feels sturdy and like it will withstand five years of being used without problem. You do have to maneuver a bit to get your pen in to the center most portion of the lines, but I don't find this difficult, and would rather have a tighter compact binding than one that is too lose and likely to fall apart after a year or two of writing in it. The pages themselves are a good thick paper and absorb ink well (I use a type of pen that can smudge on more glossy types sheets but I've yet to have a smudge issue with this journal). The gold edging makes the journal feel more fancy and adds a bit of elegance to the writing experience.<br /><br />The amount of space to write is just perfect for a sentence or two in response to the prompts. Some of the prompts really get me thinking, and some are just fun tidbits that I know I'll enjoy looking at the next years when I circle back around to the beginning again (like, \\"What is the last movie you watched\\" kind of questions). This journal is well worth the investment of both money and time and I can't wait to see what I wind up filling it in with over the years!
B004V7EW66|5.0|Simon amazingly gives Graceland a run for its money over 20 years later. Well worthy of the fabulous reviews it has been receiving.    In an era of endless remixes, bonus tracks, three versions of albums scattered all over marketplace, auto-tune, and the death of listening to music while sitting still it's great to have a simple 10 song album of great songwriting and performing. Paul Simon has had some \\"FAILS\\" in the last 10 years, but this album is nearly flawless. It's creative without being pretentious or over produced. There is simply not a bad track on it.
B003ICWTTM|5.0|I shop around for the best price I can get..  This was something my husband wanted so I found it here after checking prices everywhere.  I was able to buy a book also with the money I saved... He loved his gift and I loved the price!
B004K7HMJ6|5.0|Jessie J is brillant! She's very talented and keeps her listeners entertained. I loved each and every song. Usually artists aren't so versatile but Jessie J proved that wrong! She switches from Hip Hop, to R&B, to Pop and you won't feel that she's putting too much effort into it. Her adlibs and vocals are amazing for each song, she adds a different style to each song she sings! My favorite songs from here album are: L.O.V.E(vocals are INCREDIBLE it'll give you chills), I Need This(This song will make you speechless..just listen and you'll understand what I'm saying), Mama Knows Best(A jazzy feel song that you can relate to), and Do It Like a Dude(a different style of song that'll make you want to just get up and dance). This is definately an ablbum anyone should get if they want to hear a different fresh mix of music. Who You Are gets 5 stars from ME!!
B004NSVE4Q|5.0|Great delivery on this pristine copy of Shem's classical work, The House of God.  Presenting a worm's eye view of the Boston medical training system, this book combines dark humour with grim but insightful social commentary.  An outstanding read and, for anyone who trained in the Harvard system, some memories
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This purchase is worth every penny. The \\"Interactive Scene Deconstruction\\" option in Disc 3 is the best. The 45 mins of deleted scenes in Disc 2 is another sweet treat included in this collection.    You will find three versions of the film in Disc 1 - the original theatrical version, special edition re-release with extra 8 minutes more footage and the Collector's Extended Cut. Disc 2 - the deleted scenes and Disc 3 the amazing scene deconstruction.    A fantastic Sci-fi classic and a wonderful addition to your collection.
B002RL7W9W|4.0|When I looked at this toy, I didn't care for all that white and was concerned that the kids would not like it. Then I read the reviews, saw it on sale and bought it. The boys love it.     There are two problems. One, from the picture it was hard to figure out which pieces to select for a few of them so one of the ships didn't turn out quite as pictured. The parts don't stick together as tightly as they should. Helmets are loose. Parts fall off the ships. We may have to use some glue to keep everything together. I am not new to this type of toy. It should be more durable. It may not be easy for a 6 year old to put together especially if this is his or her first lego toy. It is probably a better toy for a 10 or 12 year old. The almost 6 year old says, \\"It was super duper hard to build it.\\"    I recommend this toy for its entertainment value. Try to buy it on sale.     We bought the rebel trooper battle pack at the same time and it is a much better set for those closer to age 6.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|OK to the guy who said it has no advantages over the 2500k or the Athlon:  Yes, it does.  It is faster.  It may not be much faster, but you really can't down-rate the processor because you think it is overpriced.  The rating is supposed to be about the performance and quality of the product.  There is a sub rating for value if you feel it is not worth it.  As for the processor, I can't say enough about it.  I'm easily overclocking it to 4.43Ghz using a Corsair A50 Heatsink.  No temp issues and when it comes to rendering video, audio or any kind of compression, this thing kills the competition.    Great Processor!
B001B7CNXI|2.0|This review is mainly about the quality of this blu ray. Too bad no remastering was done to the video for blu ray. Just like some of the reviews there are scenes on this Blu Ray release that have too much grain. Could not believe the Blu Ray case has Hi Def experience listed on the insert. I thought I was watching an upscaled DVD of the movie. On some of the night shots there is so much present of grain the picture looks very bad and unwatchable. Just be warned before you buy.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|We have watched many very good documentaries on WWII, thus far this series<br />exceeds all the others. Would give this ten of ten stars.<br /><br />The series begins with an introduction by one of the series makers<br />and ends with additional comments about the making of the series - excellent idea!<br /><br />There are 11 D.V.D.'s in this set with numerous comments by both American and Foreign observers that were personally on hand when events occurred. These interviews were indeed a highlight of the series. Personal views are very meaningful to we who watched the series here. Really great for us.<br /><br />Glad we purchased and hopefully the younger ones here will enjoy them too.<br /><br />Excellent purchase for our library.
B001UV4XHY|1.0|I love the Harry Potter series.  This is not a review about the movie itself.  Go to IMDB for that.  This is a review of the product.  I am a total visual quality snob.  This is without a doubt one of the worst movie transfers I have ever seen.  HORRIBLE!!!  I bought the 2 disc special edition DVD first.  My initial thought was that Warner Bros had purposefully sabotaged the DVD quality in order to provoke people into investing in BluRay, which would then reveal the true potential of quality.  So I returned the 2 disc special edition DVD for the DVD/BluRay combo.  Alas!  The BluRay was just as horrible.  I know it's hard to wait, but I would really encourage people to NOT let Warner Bros make a profit on such a shoddy product: reject this release.  Maybe they will get the hint that with general sales getting lower and lower each year, that they can't just abuse their customers without consequences.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|Just like Gone Baby Gone and Heat mixed together.  Loved it.  Sometimes slow in building characters but the action scenes are awesome and sound great over 7.1 AVR.
B003AXS51A|5.0|As a semi-pro driver, and a guy who lost his best friend of almost 15 years, this story really resonated with me. If someday, a guy walks up, shakes my hand, says \\"Barkley says hello\\", and walks off - I won't be a bit surprised. I picked the book up at 10am yesterday, and closed the cover at about 9pm. Enzo narrates the story exactly as I always imagined Barkley would have talked.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I really enjoyed the love story in this movie. It is a very entertaining movie with great music. Cher is absolutely wonderful in this movie especially singing \\"You Haven't Seen the Last Of Me\\". This movie was short changed by the critics, it should have been a huge hit. It is a wonderful musical and time will show it's greatness!
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|For those of you who are thinking about a multi-core processor without the multi-core price get this one you wont be sorry.Thanks amazon
B004GYY714|4.0|Love the variety, organization and quality of stations for free. So far my only problem is the occasional station that won't connect. with 4G&amp; wifi I'll never need to pay for radio.
B004GHNHVW|4.0|Tender, vulnerable and yet very assured, \\"So Beautiful or So What\\" shows the wisdom and skill of the 70-year-old (as of next October) auteur, whose career was at the peak four decades ago and two decades ago - and now it should be again. Multi-colored yet instantly recognizable, the songs sing, offer some endearingly melodic moments, although not as many as they could. Lyrically, Paul plays a man who would like to know better, but the result is dubious - almost every single song deals with mortality, eternal love, angels or afterlife. More than any other artistic statement I know, this is a work of a man who has more behind him than before and tries to be at peace with higher forces. Highlights include \\"Dazzling Blue\\", maybe his best songs in more than 20 years, the delicate \\"Questions for the Angels\\" and introspective \\"Love and Hard Times\\". Drawing something from \\"Graceland\\" as well as \\"You're The One\\", \\"So Beautiful or So What\\" is certainly a joy to listen to, although no commercial breakthrough among the teens can be expected - much better result will come from his peers. And probably critics, too.
B000T7FO6E|5.0|There's a 4-CD-R set called `Beatles Releasing Collective (BRC) LIVE' (2009). It's part of a CD-R collection that's the basis of a book about putting the Beatles back together again for the 1970-2010 era. Four cuts from this `Ringo and the Roundheads' evening contribute to that BRC LIVE set. As I recall, the performances on the CD are all very good, but the following made BRC LIVE because they're better than any other Ringo-sung `live' performances of these songs: `With a Little Help From My Friends' (the finale version), `I Wanna Be Your Man', `Don't Pass Me By', and `I'm the Greatest'. Two other Ringo-co-written songs--'Choose Love' and `Never Without You'--go onto the BRC's `Singularity' CD-R set (2010). Generally speaking, Ringo's `live' recordings with Mark Hudson and the Roundheads are better than with the various incarnations of his All Starr Band. That said, there ARE All Starr goodies her and there.
0807014273|5.0|You have to read this book. \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" was my first introduction to Viktor Frankl's work, and with great certainty I will be re-reading this book, as well as his other works many times over. The book itself is split into two sections: the first half covers the authors account of his experiences in the Nazi concentration camps, and second provides a quick introduction to his school of psychotherapy (Logotherapy) which he developed as a result of his experiences in the camps.<br /><br />Freud focused on desire, Nietschze on power, and Frankl focuses on \\"a will to meaning\\" (Logotherapy) as our primary driver. How does one survive a concentration camp, bear an incurable disease, or find meaning in an abstract idea? The author illustrates all of these questions with his experiences in the concentration camps, as well as from his medical practice.<br /><br />Perhaps only due to my own ignorance, but I am amazed that I have not come across Frankl's works before. Out of all the \\"self-help\\", \\"personal growth\\", and psychology books I've read in the past few years, this one has left the most profound impression. Highly recommend it.
0226264211|5.0|This book was written almost fifty years ago, but by God, if we all read it a bit more, then I feel certain that the country and the world at large would be in a better place.  Milton Friedman doesn't just talk about economics here (the study of the human monetary interactions) but he comes down as a consistent, brilliant, but not extreme defender of individual or familial liberty.  He's the man that, when acting as adviser to President Nixon, described compulsory military service as \\"repugnant\\" except in cases of dire emergencies.    This book is excellent as an introduction to libertarianism.  Dr. Friedman does not come off as radical or extreme in anyway--instead, what he offers are a number of ways to transition the US to becoming a more free country.  All libertarians or people interested in the ideas of individual as opposed to collective or national liberty ought to read this book very thoroughly.
0062515675|4.0|Ok, the plot and the characters are cheesy - let's get that out of the way - but the underlying ideas are interesting and useful. The author provides, in a form of a parable, a collection of timeless principles to guide your personal growth: master your mind, follow your purpose, practice kaizen, live with discipline, respect your time, selflessly serve others, embrace the present.<br /><br />It's an easy read and one suitable for all ages - I think everyone will pick up something different from it.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I love this game but:<br />It crashed once with my droid x<br />Could have been way longer<br />And the final puzzle glitches and I can't open the glowing discs !
B004I2K4E8|4.0|The new production cuts down on some of the songs, reducing the number of songs. The negative I can see is the fact is the Val jean is touch too operatic and distorts from some of the feeling that goes into the role, and Nick Jonas obviously didn't have the training to hold so many sustained notes so ended up obviously needing air and having to take breaths between notes where there shouldn't have been. However, Samantha Barks, who starred on the BBC show I'd Do Anything where she was a third place contestant for the role of Nancy in Macintosh's revival of Oliver!, performed the role of Eponine beautifully. Also, we have once again Lea Salonga performing, this time in the role of Fantine. The kids who were Gavroche and Cosette performed quite well. Overall a fairly good production. Perhaps not as good as the 10th anniversary but still worth collecting for the quality of the overall performance.
B0034G4OUO|1.0|**** Spoiler ahead ****    - The action is the same as any other average action movies. It's neither better nor worse.    - The acting is not engaging.    - There are a couple of twists that keep me watching until the end.    - There are some big logical holes that make this movie laughable. The worst is the shooting scene at the end. This was when Driver was shot in the head but he survived because of the metal sheet in his skull. He then stood up and killed the bad guy. Yeah!    - In short, it's below average.
0240815807|5.0|For many years I've bookmarked websites, .pdf'd articles here and there, and created many folders (scattered across more than one hard drive!) chock full of suggestions on how to record/mix/produce better. Each article had a tidbit or two that seemed important, but to be honest, the logistics of accessing them cut down on how useful they ultimately were to me - it was so cumbersome to find \\"that\\" article that often I didn't, and then how useful did that information turn out to be? On top of that, it wasn't that easy for me to judge the credibility of the authors ... there is a lot of chaff out there ...    I don't think I'll be referencing those articles much any more - Mike Senior's book, pretty much Talmudic in its completeness, has everything in one place, from from the basics of sound waves all the way through to the last few tweaks before printing the final mix to a stereo .wave file. Furthermore, there are a zillion references for further reading, both in the printed book itself, and in the on-line reference section (which has sound files, audio and video clips, and the like, in addition to fascinating links).     And Mr. Senior presents all this information in a common-sense, low-key (at times humorous!), and completely non-dogmatic approach - always explaining alternative methods of attacking any given problem, and explaining why he might recommend one approach over another. As a result, the \\"learning per page\\" ratio seems much higher than other books of a similar vein I have read. Example: the most recent thing I learned about had to do with ported vs non-ported monitors (check out those waterfall plots!!), what the big thing about NS-10s are, and why \\"Horrortone\\" speakers can be very helpful in mixing. All that is key information I didn't even know existed before ... and it just took 15 minutes to learn about something that has the possibility of enormously improving my mixes.      For those who would like to check out Mr. Senior's \\"creds\\" before parting with a few dollars/pounds for the book - google his name with \\"Sound on Sound Magazine\\" - he's been a staff writer there for a long time, and the way he writes there is the way he writes in this book. Also, I believe there is a free chapter or two of his book to \\"test read\\" on the Amazon site. I've been reading him for years, and found him to be a bias-free wonderful educator. The proof of the pudding regarding his skills is available monthly in Sound on Sound magazine - just listen to the \\"before vs. after\\" \\"Mix Rescue\\" mixes he rescues!    I suspect there are a lot of people in my boat - a pesky day job and other time obligations conspiring to keep them away from their DAW enough that at times it seems one might need to \\"zoom in to the sample level\\" to see if the learning curve has a positive slope! I might never be a producer of the next hit record (hey, you never know! ;-) ), but Mr. Senior's book is already helping me to get better by leaps and bounds faster than I was before.    Highly recommended for the beginner to intermediate home studio mixer (though I suspect even \\"experts\\" will find more than a few tidbits to improve their mixes as well...).
B0034G4ORM|5.0|If you're an action nut, watch it. If you're in any branch of the military, watch it. If you like to whine and cry like little baby, DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE !!! This is war people, not some sugar-coated camera angles not based in reality. Stuff happens fast, all the time, and from all angles. The camera is from the view of a squad-mate or if a news correspondent was with the squad. What do you expect? All the action to be choreographed and slowed down so your slow brain can catch up? Excellent Movie !!!
0452295548|5.0|Since I am, in part, studying the effects of psychedelic drugs, (entheogens) I was struck by the similarity between her experience and the oceanic experience. Mysticism also has these similarities.<br /><br />I'm not entirely sure she has mapped her experience perfectly in the brain, but it's an overwhelmingly well written account. Really, this book is a groundbreaker and should be read by everyone in the psychedelic/entheogen field.<br /><br />I'm also not sure that everyone has the same \\"nice programming\\" in the non-verbal side of their brain. I find this implicit proposition of the book hard to believe. But those are larger questions to study and even to figure out how to study.<br /><br />So much of science is bereft of the subjective. Having a book that so clearly describes subjective experience in a brain event is most welcome.
B0036IGJ1C|5.0|I plan to give this book to many people because it's message is so profound. Easy to read, short chapters, and a plot advanced by dialogue - Albom has done it again. I'm so glad \\"The Reb\\" asked him to write a eulogy and the other \\"Reb\\" is helping others find freedom. Two men through Albom's pen help readers to understand the mystery and strength in faith.

B004LFO0O2|4.0|After a long 5 year hiatus Strokes fans have been rewarded with what could be considered their best album since their 2001 debut (Is This It).  Even though their 3rd album (First Impressions of Earth) was considered a mis-step, it was that album which got me into them.      After listening to this album for about a month I feel like I can safely review.  I have to admit when I first listened to it, even though there were many tracks I immediately dug, I felt the album was a little all over the place.  However after listening to the album many times it becomes apparent this one body of work and not a collection of songs.      Right from the first song, Machu Picchu, it's obvious this album isn't the 'back to the basics' sound that I was hearing about prior to it's release.  However, it's a perfect opener for Angles with it's reggae tinge.  The 2nd track is the first single (and my favorite song from the album) the blazing Under Cover of Darkness - quintessential Strokes.  The album certainly has an 80's feel to it, but not a top 40 80's sound... more like how bands like The Replacements or even Husker Du were hitting their creative peak 80's sound.  The songs segue perfectly one after the other with little filler.  The tunes are well written, sticking to the memory banks after they've finished playing and is the sound of band that still has a lot of gas left in the engine.      I wasn't expecting much this go round after hearing how the band divided over the last few years so my expectations weren't very high.  Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised.  This isn't band coasting but a band that is still filling a giant void in today's music scene.  These songs are lively and a lot of fun.  If you're looking for an album to left your spirits, or to get you pumped up... or if you just want to hear some damn good music, then Angles is a perfect albums for you!
B00402FGE4|5.0|I have noticed a lot of reviews both for and against make reference to this shows differences to Atlantis and SG-1. While I admit that this show is very different from its predecessors there is one thing that the other reviewers fail to mention.   I loved all the sg-1 team and atlantis personnel, i really did, but the one thing that always bothered me was that they were perfect. They make several references in the shows to how no one is qualified for what they do and yet the two teams seem to always fix everything in the nick of time. No matter how outlandish or over the top the problem. now as a long time watcher of t.v. I know that the stargate series is not the first to do this but the point is that the real difference to Universe is that these people are people, not perfect. They are angry and selfish and stupid. They act on wants and desires and needs and not just the 'will of all things good'. They make mistakes and pay for them with the lives of there fellow crewmates or with their own.   I do miss the old exploring new worlds through the stargate concept that the other series had, in this series there usually isn't time for exploration, but i am willing to live without it for the sake of realism. I also have to admit that since the teams not perfect the show occasionally has to pile on alot of coincidences to make a story work, for example in an episode in this season the crew visits a planet where most of the main cast are killed by alien creatures but saved through a time wormhole event. that would be a little convenient in and of itself but the aliens venom holds the key to curing a disease they picked up from an entirely different planet. but even with these i still say that this show is well worth watching.
B000024C7W|5.0|An album that was panned by critics when it was first released, but has found new appreciation in the last few years. This album is a gem and right up there with Stevie's masterpieces before it (''Talking Book'', ''Innervisions'', ''Songs in the Key of Life''). Stevie definitely took a chance here and experimented with different sounds, and it worked. ''Power Flower'' is a classic track which shows off his falsetto (the only time I've ever heard him sing in falsetto) and ''Send One Your Love'' is a masterpiece of a song. Arguably his best ballad in my opinion, and that's saying something. All in all, a great album that has been criminally overlooked, but is (thankfully) being appreciated by fans and critics alike. It's just a shame that Stevie hasn't been this experimental since, probably for fear of backlash and negative critique (which is exactly what happened when he released this album). If you haven't heard [[ASIN:B000024C7W Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants]]this, then add it to your Stevie collection.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I am closing in on 61 years old.  Classic rock is my primary musical preference.  I am very critical of younger artists.  That being said, I was amazed myself at how much I have enjoyed Adele 21.  I first heard Rolling in the Deep on a video station and was intrigued by the haunting background vocalists.  I bought the CD for the only song I had heard and was pleased with almost every cut.
B0043JDUNS|3.0|This one really had very little substance. It was enjoyable enough, but not much substance there. If you just want some action, go for it. If you want something that moves the franchise along, you're going to be disappointed. If you get it on special or share the cost with some friends, it's worth it. But don't go out of your way.
0756404738|5.0|I loved the first one when it came out a few years back...and I even re-read it right before I received The Wise Man's Fear, so everything would be fresh in my mind.      TWMF starts out a bit slow.  As usual, I got marred up by Kvothe's obsession with Denna (I think she's absolutely a waste of time...I don't like her one bit).  But...once Kvothe left the university and Denna was out of the picture (somewhat, not entirely, of course) I thought it was brilliant.  For me, even being a girl and enjoying romances a bit, these two books dwell just a bit much on sex and gushing hormones.  I realize Kvothe is discovering girls and women, but for me, I like the adventure/action bits (and interaction with his friends and professors) instead of all the horny teenager bits.      The book speeds along at an exciting pace.  All in all, I thought the second book was better than the first.  They're both amazing.  Can't wait for the third book!!! :)
B00448SE4S|4.0|I like just about anything Michael Cera is in, and this was no exception. The movie is sometimes a bit hard to follow because it jumps around quite a bit. The basic premise is that Cera's character, Scott Pilgrim, meets a girl, Ramona, that he likes. The problem is she has had bad luck in the past, creating 7 evil exes that he must defeat before they can be together. The whole movie has a feel somewhere between a comic book and a video game, but not in the sense of something like \\"Tron.\\" \\"Scott Pilgrim\\" seems to caricature itself. It works, even if it's sometimes more confusing for it.
B000R4SMCW|2.0|The script for this film was average, the photography was intrusive, and the lighting was at times absurd. The biggest drawback, however, was actor Ryan Gosling.  He's either eating, rubbing his nose, or twitching and turning as he mumbles his lines.  His leading lady was only slightly more articulate. Subtitles would have been helpful.  Perhaps this shoddy acting could be called \\"post Brando.\\"    Still, this movie has Anthony Hopkins and is (barely) worth watching.  That it lacks a solid ending might contribute to the negative reviews so many have expressed.
B003LFLOOW|4.0|\\"Avatar\\" is obviously beautiful and visually stunning. The story line is pretty good, the effects are awesome, the action scenes are really fun, but the message is a bit much. They would rip up a tree and beat you over the head with their message if it weren't so directly in conflict with their message to rip up a tree. Watch the movie for some fun, but watch out for the environmental slap in the face.
B000ZMVAXO|3.0|I bought this after having looked at pretty much every available \\"headphone\\" amp out there.  Since no local shop has anything decent I had to go by internet reviews.  I wanted something around the $50 range...I already have a $300 effects pedal I can use to practice with if I wish, but I wanted something simple for when I just want to pick up my bedroom guitar.  Based on other reviews I chose this.  I tend to either play metal, or acoustic...I don't dig blues or effects heavy pop stuff.    The first thing I noticed when plugging it in is that there was a distinct \\"crackle\\" when doing palm mutes.  My review lost a star right there.  I mean, come on...it's the METAL version of this headphone amp...palm mutes are one of the cornerstone of metal.  I tried using a different guitar and different headphones...the headphones I first used were $50 ones, the next pair were $80 ones and finally some cheepo earbud types.  The crackle was not coming from the headphones, and you tend not to notice it with cheapo ones.  The guitars themselves were high end guitars with EMG and Seymour Duncan pickups.  It was obvious the weak link in the chain was the Amplug.  turning down the volume slightly helped. I know it's a $40 \\"amp\\" but come on, it's METAL...it should be turned up to 11 all the time.    The other reason I took off a star is because there is no \\"clean\\" channel on it.  I knew this before buying it, and I know how to take it apart and modify it so I can get a clean sound through it, but still...it would be a SIMPLE thing to engineer into this amp.  Every single other headphone amp I've used over the years has at least a clean channel.  This is lame lame lame.  How are you supposed to play something like \\"Fade to Black\\"???  I know they're trying to sell more of these single sound Amplugs, but if you buy the clean sound one it's another $40, and you're now pushing $100...the territory where you can buy a cheep effects pedal with other effects built in.  If I didn't know I couldmod this myself by changing a resistor and re-wireing it to a trimpot, I would NOT have bought it.  They would have lost a sale.    Bottom line; if I had tried this at a local shop, I don't think I would have bought it.  The lack of a clean channel is annoying, and the crackling would be a deal breaker for me.  Still, it's OKay for $40.  Just OKay.  The actual distortion sounds good, when you're not palm muting >eye roll< I'll give it a week or two and I may still return it.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I purchased this for my first generation iPad and found that it worked PERFECTLY!!!! I tried it with a sD card as well as the micro sD card that requires the sD adapter. No problems. For my next test, I tried plugging in my universal card reader, which will read an Olympus xD card. I plugged the USB end of the cable into the USB connection. No problem at all!!!  This was definitely worth the $$$$ paid for it.
0756404746|5.0|This book had me hooked at the Prologue.  That one page is an example of some of the finest writing I have ever come across. That said,  the rest of the book could only pale by comparison,  however the story is different, adult (in a good way) very entertaining and holds your interest to the very end.  The writing again hits some really \\"high spots\\"  during the book and I thoroughly enjoyed everything about it.  Have just started \\"The Wise Man's Fear,\\"  the 2nd book  and it shows every sign of being as wonderful as the first.  A fantasy lover's Must Read.
1416596585|5.0|Since everyone likes to write long reviews I thought I would provide an ironic, Twitter-esque, perspective:    \\"Read this book. It is amazing! It will not disappoint. Pause when you finish the last chapter. Think about it. Then read the Epilogue. Wow!\\"    (139 characters, including spaces.)
0316067598|4.0|This review is for the audio book. I write these comments with trepidation for fear of a Navy Seal kicking in my door at 4:AM and subjecting me to a brutal workout regime in the local river, during winter for 7 days straight, without sleep or food and made to drink the icy dew off a dead dogs leg...<br /><br />But seriously, what a book! I'm a Canadian by birth and we are a rather tepid, passive lot so I'll forewarn some readers that this is a very American story; it is full of patriotism, bravado, mild xenophobia and a lot of ass kicking.<br /><br /> This is also a true story and a very harrowing one. Into the first hour of the narration I found it tough to relate to the drive, training and mental conditioning needed to become a Seal, but then I became deeply hooked.<br /><br />Marcus strikes me as a genuine fellow and he basically grew up eating nails, wrestling alligators and training his body to do battle with the Terminator. The camaraderie with his Navy Seal group is touching at times and the battle in Afghanistan is more than brutal. Put your opinions of Bush and the Afghan war aside (as I did) and listen to Marcus' experience. It is gripping, sad and despite itself, even a little funny at times.<br /><br />I  think that when Marcus told his story his perspective remained intact, especially when he was rescued by the Pashtun people - some might choose to edit their opinion or broaden it even, but I think Marcus remained true to his Texas Lone Star feelings. It is a wicked story in both senses of the word and an incredible experience for all people (Afghan and American) involved.<br /><br />I liked it and recommend it if you can appreciate the hell he went through and put your politics aside for the duration. Marcus is a true hero and we are lucky that he survived to tell his story.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|A great war movie.  Lots of action, great detail.  It was very hard not to want to watch the whole 10 parts. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in war history.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved this book. It is a spin on today's reality tv. How far will this actually go? The book was suspenseful and it really was a page turner. The book isn't really brutal or gory but there were parts that gave you just enough information to let you know the extent of it. I can't wait to read the next one.
0439023521|5.0|Can you imagine a 16-year-old girl fighting to the death in an arena against 23 other teenagers?  Well that is exactly the story line to Suzanne Collins' book, The Hunger Game.  Be prepared to enjoy this novel whether you are a young teen or an adventurous adult.  It takes place in the future where the United States is gone. North America has become Panem with its major city called the Capitol. The rest of Panem is divided into 12 Districts (the former 13th had the bad judgment to revolt and no longer exists). The Capitol's yearly highlight in this dreadful world is the Hunger Games, which is a murderous TV reality show in which 24 teenagers are chosen by lottery to battle each other in a wild environment called the \\"arena.\\"  Ranging from ages 12 to 18, one boy and one girl are chosen from each district to participate.  The only way to win is to be the last one alive at the end of the game.  If you are lucky your other opponents will do most of the killing for you before you are forced to take someone else's life.  The bottom line is the winner gets a life of ease and the losers get death. The only \\"unspoken rule\\" is that you can't eat the dead contestants. Which sounds odd until you realize that there is limited food and water provided unless you hunt for it or find a water source.  You won't be able to put this book down until you read the last page.
B002ZG4Q5W|5.0|What need be said of Kurosawa's masterwork (of many masterpieces), other than Shakespeare would be proud?<br /><br />The performances, the incredible composition of every frame, the deep lush colors, the subtle camera movement, the angles, the general perfection in every way...Ran is technically and emotionally almost unreal. King Lear has never been mined more deeply than this, and the film forces the viewer to settle back and truly ponder The Bard's genius, via Kurosawa's genius. That's a lotta geniusness right there.<br /><br />This blu-ray is good but barely better than the perfect Criterion edition, which has so many fine extras. The definitive transfer has yet to be made, no doubt---I recall seeing this at a big old movie house in the '80s and the quality of that picture remains one of the best I have ever seen on a screen. But until the perfect transfer happens, I say stay with the Criterion Edition of this truly amazing film.<br /><br />And let's face it: a movie this huge and epic truly needs to be seen on the big screen, so watch out for it at your local art house. No tv screen could ever do Ran real justice.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Just as everyone else has kind of said already, this is a great album that shows even after all these years the Foo Fighters can still rock it.  Dave Grohl is a genius, and I love the fact that Bob Mould (Dear Rosemary) and Krist Novoselic (I Should Have Known) contributed on this album.    This album starts off great with \\"Bridge Burning\\" and \\"Rope\\", and ends just as great with \\"I Should Have Known\\" and \\"Walk\\", with some more great songs in between.  Outstanding, and a must have for any fan of the Foo Fighters, or even if you're not a fan you'll enjoy this album.
0446569895|4.0|It's hard to imagine a funnier, less ego-driven first half of a memoir than Ozzy's tales of his life up until 1979. Everything is said very drily and without self-aggrandizement, such a rare feat for anyone, let alone a rock star. The writing is very true to Ozzy's argot, and never feels ghost-written (which is what great ghost writing is all about). His love for his bandmates comes across clearly, and it sounds like they had a hell of a lot of fun the first five years or so.<br /><br />The drugs and booze are discussed very candidly and Ozzy is clear on both their pleasures and terrors. Well, mostly clear. The tales he can remember are often hilarious, and for sheer wacked out debauchery this is a fun read. Oz's strangely lucid self-awareness is shocking at times, unless you're a real fan and have enjoyed his often very intelligent lyrics over the decades. Check out War Pigs and Crazy Train more closely. Few rock lyricists, let alone metal guys, have ever written such incisive social commentary, let alone rocked that hard while doing it. So props for that first half, five stars all the way.<br /><br />But then arriveth The Leech. He calls her Sharon, \\"my savior\\", but those of us who have followed Ozzy's career for four decades know her merely as the ultimate cash-grabbing, non-stop-merchandizing, make-me-more-money-now-honey sleazebag of them all. Ozzy didn't want to do The Osbournes, as he admits here, but did it just for his scheming, ego-obsessed and greed-driven leech of a wife. This book confirms what many fans have felt all along: Sharon (funny name for such a greedy witch) has kept Ozzy working constantly so that she can keep spending a hundred thousand bucks on ugly clothes on Rodeo Drive every week. The tv show proved that a dozen times over.<br /><br />The Leech has promoted the endless OzFests, the tv ads, the reality shows, and so many other things that are completely at odds with the very honest, real Ozzy in the first half of this book. And she's brainwashed him with the idea that he'd be dead without her. Somehow I doubt that. The man is a survivor, and Sharon and her similarly filthy greedy father Harry Levy (oops, Don Arden...now why would he change his name from Harry Levy?) are two peas in a pod, and both fought each other to gain control of the Oz Money Machine. Ozzy has made more money for those two than he's ever seen for himself, count on that.<br /><br />So anyhow, you get an inkling of how I feel about Sharon Levy, and how weak and plastic the last half of this book feels compared to the first, Sharonless part. It's like two different people: the working class Ozzy, even when he had millions, and then the Hollywood Ozzy, when he haplessly lets Sharon spend all the millions she forces him to make for her. He says he wanted to retire years ago, but guess who won't let him? She needs her 37th face lift. Get earnin', Ozzy. She also needs her 28th house...not making that up, Ozzy has bought her 27 houses so far. The only devil Ozzy ever worshipped was this demon weasel of a wife.<br /><br />Perhaps the best example of Stealin's, I mean Sharon's, Svengali-like hold over Ozzy is when she tells him she's sick of having babies. So Ozzy, like one of her little poodles, dutifully gets a vasectomy. Then a year later Stealin suddenly decides, oh no, I DO want more babies! Ozzy, go and get that painful procedure reversed! Which he again very dutifully tries to do. But of course that's not always possible, and Ozzy endures all the pain on both sides of the operation for nothing, just his greedy plastic-faced idiot wife's caprices.<br /><br />But I've got to give props to Ozzy's daughter Amy for refusing to appear in the tv show. Now that's a smart person. Meanwhile the utterly talentless Jack and Kelly have non-careers carved out by their scheming, grasping Mommy Dearest, and both end up drug addicts. Nice going, Sharon! Then she appears as a judge on talent shows, which is classic as it's become clear she has onlyone talent: milking Ozzy. And that's it. But man oh man, she's a real pro at that.<br /><br />The truly Ozzy-centric parts here are some of the best rock memoirs ever written, so make sure to read the first part of this book. Bill Ward is especially endearing and humorous (and such a fine drummer). The tales of Randy Rhoads are touching; what a loss that was and is. Jake and pals can never measure up, though Zakk has given it a good try. And as for the sleaziest move in music over the last fifty years (a tough competition), nothing tops Sharon Leech's decision to rerecord the first two Ozzy albums with the same git and vox tracks over new bass and drum tracks! Unreal. The new versions SUCK, and it's so ironic that she's mad at Daisley and Kerslake for trying to milk more money from the Ozzy Machine. Only one witch is allowed to do that, boys. And there ain't no sharin' with Sharon.<br /><br />So, five stars for Ozzy and the first part of this book, and zero stars for Sharon The Hideous Plastic Surgery Leech and her endless greed and phony, Hollywood, completely un-Ozzy selling of Ozzy over the last 25 years.one talent: milking Ozzy.

B00430EQJY|5.0|This DVD presents highlights from the \\"Ring\\", presented at the Valencia opera house, conducted by Z. Mehta.  The productions use of complex projections and vivid colors, as well as interesting mechanical effects, holds the viewer's interest, even during the long stretches of music associated with Wagner's music dramas.  The cast is acceptable without being outstanding and the orchestral playing is first rate.  This DVD is inexpensive and gives the viewer a taste of the production in order to judge whether to purchase the complete operas.

B004S699K4|3.0|About the Blu-Ray release:<br /><br />Echo Bridge Home Entertainment acquired a number of Miramax titles in the sale (they were split between them and Lionsgate), which I was excited about. We would be getting forgotten genre pictures like this on Blu-Ray at reasonable prices. I for one like \\"Halloween: H20 - 20 Years Later\\" and was looking forward to the release. What I am confused about is, like everyone else, the way Echo Bridge is treating the films they are releasing. The picture quality isn't horrible on this release. In fact it's the best the film has ever looked on home video. Moreover this is the first anamorphic transfer the film has seen, which is great. BUT for a reason I can't even fathom Echo Bridge has decided to crop the sides of the frame (harkening back to the nightmare that was Pan & Scan) and force the film (which was shot in 2.35:1) into the new HDTV 'fullscreen' aspect ratio (1.78:1). This is totally uncalled for, especially in todays day and age. Things like this shouldn't even be happening. BUT the release is a catch 22 when it comes to the picture quality. Like I said, the image we do get is rather crisp, so you will get a nice (not excellent, mind you) transfer if you do purchase it. Unfortunately, you will be loosing picture due to the cropping. Plus, if you are stuck with the old Miramax DVD, watching it on your HDTV is going to be horrible, since it's a non-anamorphic transfer. Still, you will still want to hang onto that DVD if you are a fan of the film because none of that Collector's Edition's special features are ported over to the Blu-Ray. I am going to go ahead and recommend this release only if you are a die hard fan of the \\"Halloween\\" series, because in that case, you will get nice picture quality. If you are a stickler for the technical presentation as a whole, stay far, far away from these Echo Bridge releases.<br /><br />About the film:<br /><br />\\"Halloween: H20 - 20 Years Later\\" is the true part 3 to the Michael Myers saga. The many films to feature the character (they number 10 in total) are mostly nonsense, but at least this picture actually tries to accomplish something. Brining back Laurie (a good Jamie Lee Curtis) into the mix was the correct thing to do. In fact, they even make the character believable. I like everything they did with the story here but unfortunately it's far too little. The film barely runs 80 minutes rendering the interesting aspects of the story vague. But against it's own sabotage it strangely succeeds. It may not be deep but it's brisk and fun and it's nice to see a conclusion to the Michael and Laurie story. (Ignore every wretched sequel besides this one.)<br /><br />Side note:<br />I am able to comment on this prerelease due to that it's currently available as a Best Buy exclusive until May 3, 2011.re the character (they number 10 in total) are mostly nonsense, but at least this picture actually tries to accomplish something.

B004EPYZP8|4.0|This legal thriller is a refreshing break from all of the mindless, style-over-substance 3D fare Hollywood is churning out lately. It's a throwback to the days of classic courtroom dramas and police procedurals, with enough interesting twists and turns to keep eyeballs glued to the screen. Matthew McConaughey is superbly cast as the smooth operator lawyer. The rest of the casting is also exceptional, down to some of the bit parts like the bail bondsman, the jailhouse snitch, the biker, and the busted hooker. (I especially appreciated William H. Macy as the private investigator; I do wish that Marisa Tomei had a meatier role that allowed her to shine as she did in \\"My Cousin Vinny.\\") Michael Connelly is one of the best current authors in the hard-boiled police procedural genre, and the adaptation stays pretty true to his spirit. As someone who works in the criminal justice system, I appreciated the realism. Money, connections, backroom wheeling and dealing, and simple twists of fate often trump justice. Just four stars because although it was solid and great fun to watch, it lacked a profound message or deep impact that would make it  memorable. You certainly won't regret watching it.<br /><br />CAUTION: If you have not seen this movie, do not watch the trailer. It spoils the plot.
B003EYVXUU|3.0|Mr King said it to be the best american horror movie in the past 20 years. I wouldn't say that.. not even close. I found it to be very boring in many parts I almost fell asleep. It was not even scary just a good tale that could have been better. I bought it for the reason of the review and wish I had not.

But this is the first book that I HAD to read in one day. Now I'm just dying to get the next one. It is seriously riveting and, as someone mentioned before, it doesn't make lame comments about being set \\"in the future\\". It's so realistic and fast paced. i just LOVED IT.

B004WMKSH2|2.0|The lighting levels in virtually every scene are so dim that you would be far better off to simply re-read the book.  Paying to look at a video that consists of a totally black screen for two thirds of a 2 1/2 run time is utterly ridiculous.    I am ticked off at this.  (Seriously -- I am a huge fan of the series and all of these actors and whoever shot this movie ought to be ashamed of themselves.  Whoever is responsible for this, at best, has a great future in radio.)
B004FECNIO|5.0|Yes, this movie is definitely a polarizing movie.     Just give it 2 chances. Watch it once. Give it a little time and watch it again. If you still don't like it, then to each his or her own. There is a transition that is a BIT rough at first.    I do wonder what this might have been if Kubrick gave it his more austere, less emotional approach to this story. But what we do have is Spielberg's heart on his sleeve story telling. And Spielberg's emotional, sometimes sentimental touch does at times rub me the wrong way. For example, I did not really care for all that sentimentality in \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" In the end, it felt a bit artificial...     But I think Spielberg's emotional touch allows him to effectively and beautifully tell this story of what a robot with human intelligence would search for. Adding emotion to a story about a robot is just possibly what it needed.    And a bit about the ending/rough transition (small spoiler). Yes, the 2nd ending was initially difficult for me as well, but now I find that very 2nd ending incredibly heartfelt and perhaps the best part of the movie.
1602839158|4.0|I had a tough time getting into this book, but since it was so well reviewed, decided to try the audiobook.  I really enjoyed it - the voices of the characters came through loud and clear (and for me anyway, this made the story easier to follow).  The audio also includes the powerpoint, so nothing's left out.  Good stuff and worthwhile!
0553386794|4.0|This book was quite good, and a bit of a turn from what I normally read. It took me awhile to get into it, as the book is so long and there are so many characters, getting into the world in the series seemed a little tedious at first. That said, once I got the hang of it and began to understand the world, I really got into it. The character development was great, and I loved how the twists and turns shaped the story. I have to say, the plot twists in this novel are amazing.  You never know what each character will do, and it is a captivating read because I kept wanting to see what would happen next.  I have to admit, this book gets 4 stars from me instead of 5 just because of some of the violence towards the children.  Yes, there is violence towards children in this book.  It is part of the story, and part of the fantasy world, but it's not always easy to read.  I am very eager to begin reading the next book of the series.

0525951652|4.0|I received the book on time and in great condition...   This is a good book and I will read the upcoming two parts, but it is not the best that Ken Follett has written.
0061726826|4.0|This novel has gotten a lot of buzz, so I'm always a little hesitant to read a book when people going ga-ga over it because it always seem to let me down. DELIRIUM however didn't do that. It really was just as good as people say. I'll admit, though, the 1st 80 pages or so didn't really hook me, but I kept reading, hoping to be blown away. For me it really didn't happen til the party scene. Once you get there, this novel is action packed. The 1st quarter of the book is all world building, so if you can make it past that part, I promise you'll love Delirium if you like Dystopian novels.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the main character, Lena. She is described as a short, ordinary girl, but yet her inner strength, that she doesn't even know she has, really makes her special. Her drive and determination made me root for her and want her to succeed. She is so passionate about Alex, the boy she loves. I want them to run away together and live happy out in the \\"Wilds\\", away from the authority of the current government where love is forbidden.<br /><br />The ending left me literally screaming NO! I want to know what happens next. I need to know what happens next! I'm hooked and can't wait til book two. You'll see what I mean when you get there!<br /><br />This one gets a 4 rating from me, ONLY because of the slow beginning. Other than that, the book is amazing.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|Usually when the critics or majority of the viewing public trash something, I like it. Sex and The City 2 is no exception.  I was not a fan of the the show when it was in production.  Instead, I fell into watching the show in reruns while flipping channels one evening and became hooked.  Many fans didn't like the movies.  I don't really know what most viewers expect when they see a movie.  Life is not always one big party and the portrayal of these characters show that for every exciting monment in one's life, they are lulls or down monments.  Vacations are not always what we want them to be, again, hence the adventures of this quartet of ladies.  You have to admit that Samantha's antics caused a bit of excitment when they were surrounded by angry locals.  I liked this movie, as I did the first one and I'm trying to collect the series.  I don't think this is a waste of money or time, but then, everyone has an opinion.
B003Y5H5KQ|5.0|I went into seeing Hanna not expecting much. Boy, was I blown away.<br /><br />The story is about a girl, Hanna, who lives in the cold tundra worldness with her father, and he's always training her. Hanna is strong, smart, fast, deadly, and a force to be reckoned with. Hanna decides that he needs to live in the \\"real\\" world, and feels she has the necessary skills to do so.  Her father leaves it up to her to decide, and she does. Soon, the CIA is after Hanna, to kill her and her father. As the story goes on, we find things out about Hanna, as she discovers things about herself, and who she really is.  Hanna just wants to be left alone, but the CIA won't let her be. Fine, if the CIA wants a war, then Hanna has no problem giving them what they want.<br /><br />It was interesting to see Hanna adapt and cope in the real world. Things that you and I take for granted, she has to discover and get used to.<br /><br />As the viewer, we have such an emotional connection to Hanna.  We get to know her on such a personal basis that we can't help but to root for her when she starts busting heads.  We're right along with her as she makes decisions, and we feel what she's feeling when she has to face consequences  of her decisions.<br /><br />The casting is top notch.  The girl that plays Hanna is perfect, as well are the bad guys. We love to hate them, and when Hanna takes them out, we can't help but to smile.<br /><br />Another fantastic aspect to the movie is the musical score. It has to be one of my favorites that I've seen in any movie.  This adds a wonderful touch to it.<br /><br />If you see this movie, I can promise that you won't be sorry.

Listen to Bleeding Me, Fuel, The Outlaw Torn, Devil's Dance, etc. Songs I quite enjoy. Crush Em, Wanderlust, Time:The Beginning, Ecstasy, and Insomnia. Some good tunes but they took it a bit far on the pop aspect of things. Why did Dave have to listen to Lars? Ugh 6.5/10

0439023513|5.0|I have been totally hooked in the entire Hunger Games Trilogy, unable to put them down since opening the first one.  Mockingjay not only continued with the writing style that drew me in from the beginning but it summed up the entire story and did so in a manner that was realistic to the unfortunate events of the series.
B004WMMESS|5.0|For fans of The Vampire Diaries, Episode 18 is a keeper.  It may be the best episode this season so far, maybe even the best of the whole series. Believe me, you won't want to wait for the complete season 2 DVDs to come out. After watching it you have to wonder why Elena doesn't just go ahead and fall in love with Damon - he is clearly the \\"better, hotter, superior choice\\", as he so immodestly said in the past. Surprises, excitement, suspense, drama, anguish, romantic love, self sacrifice - all are here in abundance. And Damon is masterful, strong, serious and selfless (yes, selfless!) as he fights to keep Elena alive.  Sorry Stefan, your big brother left you in the dust in this one!  Get this episode!!
B000001GXJ|5.0|This is the Verdi opera that separates the casual admirer from the dyed-in-the-wool devotee.  Once you put on this recording and listen half way through, you will feel that you have died and gone to Verdi Heaven, and you know what - for all intents and purposes, you have!  A strong, strong story...a score that gets better by the minute...a cast and conductor to die for...it is truly a Masterpiece.  This is It!  This is Opera!      Unfortunately, none of us in our lifetime will ever see on stage a company like this one.  Cappuccilli, Mirella Freni, Ghiaurov, Jose Carreras...van Dam, Foiani, Savastano conducted by Claudio Abbado.  Simply Awesome!  The critics, the fans knew at the time that this performance was a milestone...it was this company...it was this performance that brought Simon Boccanegra back to the stage and established it as one of Giuseppe Verdi's finest creations.  The problem is when will the world ever see a company perform at this level again?  (Probably, like Haley's comet...once every 76 years! The historic 1939 performance with Tibbett and Pinza is the only exception and it is only sporadically available, and often in truncated editions.) Verdi himself didn't see it.  The opera bombed when it was first performed. You need two bass, two baritones, one tenor and one soprano, and they all have to be the very best!!!  Verdi loved this opera - he knew he could make it better.  Twenty years after its first debut, he and Arrigo Boito brought out a new, revamped version which was received much better.    The orchestral scoring is mature and beautiful.  The strings in the opening Prologue suggest sea waves washing up on shore.  The instrumental opening of the First Act provides a gentle bucolic softness which perfectly sets the stage for the appearance of Amelia, the long-lost daughter of the Doge of Genoa.  In Boccanegra, Verdi composed an opera which utilizes the lower male voices of baritone and bass.  One of the pleasures of listening to this opera ishearing the darker sounds of the orchestra - the strings, the violas, and double-basses along with the male voices which resemble the tonal color of the oboe and bassoon.  And when we hear the lighter tones of the soprano (Freni) and tenor (Carreras) it is as if their arias and duets are beautiful clear gems set upon a dark background or as the sails of ships at sea would appear on the dark waves of the Genoese harbor.     How many stars should this recording get?  As many stars as one can see on a clear summer night's sky from the Lighthouse of Genoa!
0307474712|5.0|Since the act was discussed in previous reviews alredy, I will not pick up on this again, but instead write down a few basic thoughts on this book.    There are rare books who can not only intrigue readers from page one to the last page, but also even days/months/years later after reading them. - \\"One Day\\" is one of these \\"once read, never forget to quickly\\" books.    Dex and Emma. Emma and Dex. - Alas...their friendship/love to each other attracts through the whole book, without beeing too kitschy or boring.   As a reader you become a spectator of these two people who could not be more different, but do not lose their lives out of sight.     Restrospective the reader will try to answer all the different answers, that will appear to handle the story.    This book is a beautiful book. A sad, beautiful book about an everlasting friendship.

You can start to see 'the other side, in your own life, your own 'small thing' too.    It opened my heart to us in all our frailties.     On my best ten novels (novelists) of all time list.  Others?

B004S8NBDI|4.0|Let's step back 10 years(holy crap, it's been that long?). I'm listening to the radio, turn the local alt. rock station on, and I hear a Tom Petty riff but instead of Tom Petty I hear a young, garage band voice telling me that \\"last nite/she said/'oh baby I feel so down'\\". Ever since then, I've always have had a soft spot for The Strokes. \\"Is This It\\" ranks up *there* on my top album list.  While I have nothing bad to say about \\"Room On Fire\\" and while \\"First Impressions of Earth\\" was a disappointment(ok ok I like Heart in a Cage...)...when I heard that Julian and the boys were making a new album, I was stoked!     Let's talk about the songs on the album.   Manchu Picchu: Strong start to the album, nice overdriven guitar riffs, also got a nice funk going on(and wait,is that Boombox Julian making a cameo?)! +1    Under Cover of Darkness: Ah yes, the single.The opening guitar riff is awesome. Heck, the guitar work is a la \\"Is This It\\"(yeah, I'm sure you've heard that a million times), the Strokes I fell in love with. Solid song. +1    Two Kinds of Happiness: Wait, I'm not listening to The Police, am I?Do not want     You're So Right: Sounds like it belongs in a cheesy cop movie. But solid middle. More of that awesome guitar work.Meh     Taken For a Fool: This one's been making the late night show rounds, it's a wonderful little ditty,the guitar riff sticks with you. This has to be my favorite on the album. Kinda falters in the middle though +1 +1 +1!     Games: More of that 80s pop coming in(electronic drums?synths?is that AUTO TUNE????).Drags on as well. Not too bad though.Meh     Call Me Back: Hm...this guy is kinda an outlier. Do not want      Gratifaction: HECK YES! MOAR awesome guitar work!And harmonies! +1 +1!     Metabolism: I agree with a previous reviewer that it sounds an awful lot like it would belong on[[ASIN:B002O1TMI4 The Resistance]](Seriously, the high pitched shouts, the riffs!). Yes, it does mean, it's nice. +1     Life is Simple in the Moonlight: every breath you take/every move you make...wait...hmm...wrong band. Nice chorus/riff. Good end for the album.+1     This album draws very heavily on heavy metal and 80s music, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Overall, while the songs don't grab me like the songs on \\"Is this It\\"...It's still a nice album.   (PS: Pitchfork was too harsh on this album ;))

B002ZG977Y|3.0|CLASH OF THE TITANS was perhaps more entertaining as a 3D movie in theaters than it is on the small screen of the home television where the CGI effects are less impressive and at times downright silly. Louis Leterrier directed this remake of the 1981 Olivier/Hamlin epic based on Beverley Cross's take on the struggle for power between the Greek Gods and mankind: this time around the myth is manipulated by Travis Beacham, Phil Hay, and Matt Manfredi who have managed to create dialogue that must have been embarrassing for the actors to speak.  The gods are either surrounded by blinding light or smog-on-a-bad-day smoke and the presence of the creatures of the very mixed up version of the myth range form beautiful Pegasus (flying horses) to a voluptuous Medusa to the bigger than life scorpions and devilish gods to the Kraken who probably wins the contest for most disgusting beastie - though the competition is tough!<br /><br />The story is basically an attempt of Zeus and the gods on Olympus to restore their tainted reputation as being adored and worshiped through the wiles of Perseus who is thwarted by a long standing sibling rivalry victim Hades in Perseus' travels to kill the Medusa and the supposedly indestructible Kraken. It is a tale of men versus kings versus gods versus good and evil.  The very odd aspect of this dark film is the fact that of many of the cast are among the finest actors on the screen. Some are minor actors (Sam Worthington plays Sam Worthington who is placed complete with burr cut in the role of Perseus), but others include Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Hans Matheson, Danny Huston,  Nicholas Hoult, the departed Pete Postlethwaite, Mads Mikkelsen (the strongest in the cast), a very chubby Polly Walker, Elizabeth McGovern, Gemma Arterton - the list goes on and on.<br /><br />Having never seen the original 1981 Clash of the Titans makes comparison impossible, but if the purpose for making this over the edge movie was to test contemporary 3D techniques it probably succeeds. As for the acting and the script - this film is merely a chuckle.  Grady Harp, April 11ceeds. As for the acting and the script - this film is merely a chuckle.  Grady Harp, April 11
B002ZG9800|4.0|I generally don't like Jim Carrey's movies, but I have seen one or two<br />films where he really gets to show his talent; and this is one of those films.<br />Although he plays a con man and gets to mug for the camera (many times); he<br />also gets to play really sweet and touching love scenes with Ewan McGregor.<br />Everything about this film fits right. It's a little over 90 minutes, which<br />keeps things moving swiftly.<br /><br />It's so terrific that these two male actors agreed to take on the challenge<br />of playing gay lovers. Everyone should see this film!

185984054X|3.0|Frankly, I expected more from Hitchens... The central ideas behind this book seem to be that: a) Mother Theresa was less concerned with actually caring about the sick and the poor than she was about propagandizing for Holy Mother church; and that b), in accruing vast wealth while ostensibly living in poverty, her organization (clothed as it is in the inviolate respectability of religion) got away with conduct for which secular organizations and persons would have been called to account. Sadly, these theses ere never properly developed. This book (really a long pamphlet at only 90 pages) is exceptionally badly organized and ends up being little more than a haphazard diatribe. It could have been an interesting expose of an important issue but the author has instead just tossed off a quick and dirty pay-copy. I was not impressed.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Unlike Bob Dylan, his only rival as the greatest songwriter/poet to emerge in the 1960s, Leonard Cohen is an affable sort, prefacing his songs with remarks to the audience whom he calls \\"friends.\\" While glum Bob acts like he's making a sacrifice by appearing before his fans, Cohen thanks them for \\"keeping my songs alive\\" and says, \\"We're honored to play for you tonight.\\" He jokes with them in his witty, self-deprecating way. In Leonard Cohen Live in London, taped at the O2 Arena on July 17, 2008, he recalls that he was 60 when he last played London, \\"just a kid with a crazy dream.\\"<br /><br />And the crowd loves him, cheering enthusiastically, and roaring their approval when, in his raspy baritone, he sings those lines from 1988's \\"Tower of Song\\":<br /><br />  \\"I was born like this, I have no choice,<br />  I was born with the gift of a golden voice.\\"<br /><br />Cohen's voice IS golden, and the songs are magnificent. He performs 24 of them in this concert, all but one from his selective pen. Most of his signature works are here - \\"Suzanne,\\" \\"Everybody Knows,\\" \\"Take This Waltz,\\" \\"Hallelujah,\\" \\"Sisters of Mercy\\" (but not, alas, my favorite, \\"Joan of Arc\\") - songs whose melancholy tone nonetheless have a calm, soothing effect, the perfect antidote to a world that, as Cohen observes, \\"is plunged in darkness and chaos.\\" Hallelujah, indeed!<br /><br />Cohen is also kind to his collaborators, introducing his band and backup singers several times, and highlighting their exceptional work even during the songs (\\"Dino Soldo on the saxophone,\\" he points out midway through \\"Bird on the Wire,\\" and \\"Javier Mas on the archilaud\\" before Cohen has even sung a note of \\"Who By Fire\\").<br /><br />I'll always rank Cohen's October 1988 appearance on PBS's Austin City Limits above any other live performances since it was then that I was formally introduced to this incomparable artist (and when will that glorious hour be released on DVD?), but Leonard Cohen Live in London is outstanding. This is a moment in time to be cherished, now and in the future, when, to paraphrase the man himself, we ache in the places where we used to play. If possible, his voice and music will resonate even stronger then, and heal the most battered heart and soul. I love you, Leonard.<br /><br />Brian W.

159448385X|5.0|This is the story of two Afghan women, Mariam and Laila. Even though its fictional, it is placed as if it happened in the last 40 years. Different events bring tragedy to the lives of both women, and eventually their stories intertwine. It is sad story that reflect what probably are \\"the worst\\" parts of Afghan culture, where men impose their will on women as if they are their possession. As a background, the reader gets a sense of how all the wars impacted life for the people of Afghanistan. It is a very sad book, where there's little room for laughter or hope. Yet it is also a beautiful work. I fully recommend it.

B0049P1VHS|4.0|AMC's The Walking Dead has every element that makes for a great new show. Based loosely on Robert Kirkman's The Walking Dead Books, this series takes you on it's own storyline with many different twists and turns. The direction is perfection with Shawshank Redemption's Frank Darabont sitting in the director's chair. Added to this talent is Gale Anne Hurd, who produced Aliens and The Terminator. The cast completes this award winning line up of writing, directing and producing, with Andrew Lincoln playing the main character, law officer Rick Grimes, his partner and best friend Shane Walsh played by Jon Bernthal, his wife Lori Grimes played by Sarah Wayne Callies, along with a great supporting cast.<br /><br />Great performances by some of the supporting cast includes Morgan Jones played by Lenny James, Glenn played by Steven Yeun- a huge fan of The Walking Dead Books, Sisters Andrea played by Laurie Holden and Amy played by Emma Bell, Brothers Merle Dixon played by Michael Rooker and Daryl Dixon played by Norman Reedus and Dale played by Jeffrey Demunn. The characters make this show believable by contrasting their human flaws, courage and fears against the non emotional zombies.<br /><br />The story begins with two law officers Rick Grimes and Shane Walsh going through their typical day in a town just outside of Atlanta. While stopping a car of gun toting thugs, Rick, the main character gets shot and after being in the hospital for weeks awakens to a nightmare world of the living dead- zombies. He's totally alone and has no idea where to begin to find out what's happened and where his family is. Following Rick through this challenging new world of zombie gore and the emotional torment he has of the people he may never see again, along with the few non zombie people he meets along the way makes for a great storyline that keeps you watching. I was quite surprised that this main All-American John Wayne type character Rick Grimes is in real life British. Andrew Lincoln does a tremendous job in playing law officer Rick Grimes.<br /><br />There are only 6 Episodes in this first season of The Walking Dead:<br />1. Days Gone Bye<br />2. Guts<br />3.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|I bought this headset and did not heed the reviews on its durability. Less than 3 weeks after recieving the earphone became detached from the headband. Being an engineer I thought I could fix it. Not likely since the pivot point which breaks between the earpiece and headband is a thermoset small piece of plastic there is no gluing it back together of replacing it on your own since the connecting sound wire runs through it.THIS plastic Pivot piece should have been made out of steel got it CHINA? No sense returning it since it will break again if fixed with the same design. Look for another unit and stay away from this one.
B004NSULHM|4.0|Before anything else is said, this album is hard to digest.  Ever since the Lotus Flower video appeared on youtube, I have tried to understand what was going on musically.  I hated the song so much.  But recently I viewed it again and enjoyed it.  After listening to more samples, I decided to take a gamble with this album.    My first impression is that they have progressed on beyond In Rainbows.  I hated that album when it came out, too.  I bought it because I was fascninated with their new anti-label, pay-what-you-want album policy.  It grew on me over time, and finally I loved it.  My conclusion is that the Radiohead members don't make straight forward rock anymore.  I also have OK Computer, and if it wasn't for Thom's voice, nobody would know this was the same band.  I do think there is something to get out of this music, though.      The songs, as others have mentioned, have lots of samples and layers.  After listening, I can hear some more traditional sounding instrumentation mixed in, but it isn't exactly prevalent.  The album sounds exactly like it was made on a computer.  At the same time, when most computer made albums sound very full and loud, this sounds like it was made with a strong degree of minimalism in mind.  If drum loops and ambient music don't sound appealing, this album is probably not a good choice for you.      All of the songs just sound like a single work to me.  I like the way the music flows through all eight tracks.  I have listened to the album about ten times all the way through (five of those were from writing a paper today).  The music is great for writing a paper, studying, driving around, pretty much anything that isn't high energy.  It is good music to think to, if that makes any sense.      In response to a great deal of the album reviews I have seen, I don't think the people that don't like this album are merely \\"not getting it.\\"  I don't think they are stupid or musically backward.  This music is one album of pure experimentalism.  It sure isn't a pop record.  It isn't even a good alternative rock album.  It is hard to classify.  But if I am looking for a display of musicianship, I would never turn to this.  If I was looking for something to lift my mood, it would not be this.  I would much rather hear something else like OK Computer.  Maybe not the same musical direction, but something with louder electric guitars and real drums.  I do commend Radiohead for doing what they want to do.  They have no fear at this point.  They have nobody to impress.  This album represents a free spirit, the ability to be different with nothing standing in the way.  I view this album as something different that I can turn to when I need something less traditional to listen to.  But if you don't care for it, I more than understand because it is almost too different.      My advice is to listen to this on youtube first. I jumped in and made a gamble.  I got lucky on liking it.  Many people have had different results.  This album is so hard to digest, and it takes more than one listen before it really even gets interesting.  On my first listen I was heavily tempted to skip tracks.  Just listen through every second of it and see what happens.  I hope you like it- if not, you fit in with several listeners.  Don't sweat it.
0307593495|3.0|I guess there is no suspense left.  Anyway, having seen some of the episodes on the TV series (BBC?), I was anxious to read this newest novel.  The plot was good, but the nostalgia was often distracting.  I get it - the 7th time, the 8th time...I understand!  The endless non-plot related reminiscences made the novel seem drawn out - overwhelming at times - the suspense that was the real plot.<br /><br />As I finished the book, I was also saddened by the end of the Wallander series, but I must wonder whether Mankell's descriptions of Kurt's mental demise might just be autobiographical rather than fictional.

0596804822|2.0|The title 'iPhone 3D Programming' is misleading.  This book is focused on cross-platform development in C++, which is cool but makes the title of the book incidental and mostly a marketing gimmick.  Yes, you're using Xcode and running your apps on iOS devices, but the real goal is cross-platform development using OpenGL ES via a set of C++ classes.    It feels like the author basically had this work lying around and ported it to the iPhone, then wrote chapters to share with us.    Nowhere are the core frameworks reused or integrated with OpenGL in interesting or creative ways, and a lot of useful frameworks are tossed to the wayside in favor of wrapper C++ classes.  It shows the author's inexperience with the platform.    The actual OpenGL meat is tasty here, but the iPhone integration is pointless and very novice.

0763644765|5.0|I purchased this potty book because my 22-month-old son is expressing more & more interest in potty training. I was greatly disappointed by the ONE potty book choice at Babies R Us & so I looked online, saw this & thought the cover illustration looked cute so I gave it a whirl. It is SUCH a cute book (sweet illustrations) with a good story. My son ASKS for \\"Potty book\\" at storytime each night. And this has lead to him sitting on his potty more, too. Win, win!
B001UV4XHY|1.0|Let me first start out that I do not read the books, I just watch the movies. I have always found the movies good entertainment and good movies in which to have children watching. In fact I have always look at the Harry Potter movies as children's movies along the lines of the Wizard of Oz from my day. However this movie was a chore to watch. I keep looking at the time remaining to see when it would end. The acting was amateurish, the lighting terrible and a poor transition to DVD with too much pixilation and a story hard to follow. This movie was too dark, moody and I hate to say it, a little too violent. This is not a movie I would want my kid to watch. It was nowhere in keeping with the genre of the other Harry Potter movies. What a waste of money and time watching this painfully BAD movie. This just seem to be a way for the franchise to cash in on the popularity of the other movies and they could care less if the movie was any good. It is like they just wanted to get something out so they can get the money from the movie and the movie tie-in games. If you don't agree with this assessment fine as this is MY opinion about this movie, Not your opinion! Base on some comments I guess some people still do not GET IT. I am making a opinion on the Movie NOT the book. Very few movies based on books are true to the book. Books take hours to read movies do not! As a movie that is part of the Harry Potter franchise and comparing it to the other Harry Potter movies I think this one is TERRIBLE!!!!!!! I do like all the other movies in the Harry Potter franchise!

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Every once in awhile a CD comes along that reminds of the beauty of the human spirit, the innocence, emotion and frailty that we all have and the admission of our inner vulnerability. These songs bring tears to my eyes. They chronicle the emotions of relationships and how we give ourselves to another and we expect the same in return. We love and in return we expect love. Adele has done what many attempt to do but so many fail, she has written a CD about the evolution of love and the decline of relationships. This CD is absolutely amazing from start to finish. Thank you Adele for helping me during a very emotional time in my life as you has helped me see that this inner vulnerability is actually a thing of beauty. You are truly an amazing artist and destined to be around for a very, very long time. I cannot wait to see you in Philadelphia.

B0034G4ORM|5.0|I thought from the very first preview that I saw that this was a must-see film.  I was right!  This movie totally rocked from start to finish!  Those who gave it negative reviews are, well ... let's not use that kind of language!  The acting was great, the special effects were awesome, and it really looked like Los Angeles was being destroyed!  If you are a little wuss, afraid of violence and serious action, then stay away!  If you are a whiny little critic that doesn't know a good action movie when you see it, then stay away!  If you like raw, gritty, all out, quite realistic action, then YES, DEFINITELY buy this movie!  My wife even thoroughly enjoyed it - start to finish!  I'll be getting it on BluRay the day it comes out, that's for sure!  Five stars all the way from me on this one ... and I KNOW a good action movie when I see it (unlike a few others who reviewed it here)!  :-)

B000093004|5.0|This is a remaster of an older album released somewhere around 1992.<br />This version includes the five bonus tracks one of which is an extended version.<br /><br />Another bonus is the contributions from Albert Collins on \\"The Blues Is Alright\\" and B.B. King on \\"Since I Met You Baby.\\"<br />So a few blues legends stopped by \\"after hours\\" to jam. How cool is that?<br /><br />Here are a few quick impressions on some of the songs that I like the most on \\"After Hours\\":<br /><br />\\"Cold Day In Hell\\" is the leadoff track and it sets the pace for a very good cd.<br />Gary Moore added a horn section,a piano, and backgound singers to accent his blistering lead guitar on this track. The vocals make this seem like it should be his \\"signature\\" song.<br /><br />\\"Since I Met You Baby\\" stands out for the guitar playing style and vocals shared by Moore and B.B. King. The quip from B.B King at the end of the song (\\"You Tell em' Gary\\") gives a glimpse into the working relationship between the two. This is a terrific song and one of the best that Gary Moore did in my opinion. There a few You Tube videos with these two performing together and the comraderie was evident and even entertaining.<br /><br />\\"Only Fool In Town\\" tears it up right out of the gate. It's more of a hard rock inspired blues tune. The lead licks are screamers! There is a horn section backing it up and the vocals are great! \\"There's something about that woman.\\" \\"You can take it from me, you're not the only fool in town.\\"<br /><br />\\"Jumpin' At Shadows\\" is another well-done slow ballad that Gary Moore seemed to perform on every blues cd that I have listened to. The choice of notes and when to use them makes this a beautiful song! This is what I would call a \\"blues ballad\\". Penned by Duster Moore and performed Gary Moore style.<br /><br />\\"The Blues Is Alright\\" is a Milton Campbell penned song notable for its slow subtle start that explodes into a blues lead that screams for attention. An added treat is the dual guitar of Gary Moore and Albert Collins. Some fantastic blues guitar can be heard on this song!<br /><br />\\"All Time Low\\" is an extended version song. Some of these extended versions get to be too long. Like a guest that won't take the hint and leave. This particular track is an exception! I'm left thinking it ended too soon. The backbeat is basic and repetitive but it sets up one of Gary Moore's best blues lead guitar performances. So good that I hit the rewind button enough to worry about wearing this track out. He covers a lot of stylistic ground from an almost crying sound to fast spanish style licks.<br /><br />The last track is \\"Once In A Blue Mood\\", an instrumental.<br />One minor complaint that I have is that this song starts out very faint or low. Maybe it was planned and recorded that way for some reason. Not a big deal.<br />The bass is like a jazz bass line and there is a piano accompanying it.<br />What stands out front and center is the lead guitar and the tasteful placement of those notes.<br />I'm not crazy about instrumentals in general, but this one rates very high in my eyes and ears.<br /><br />I noticed that two songs were misspelled in the track listings. They were identified correctly by title on the lyrics pages. The songs are \\"The Blues Is Alright\\" and \\"Once In A Blue Mood.\\"<br />If you listen to enough songs from an artist as versatile as Gary Moore you will find some high quality tunes that just aren't your style or taste. \\"Separate Ways\\", \\"The Hurt Inside\\" and \\"Nothing's The Same\\" are those songs for me.<br /><br />I would rate this cd at 4 stars if not for the bonus tracks.<br />[[ASIN:B001FBSLHW Bad for You Baby]] is a cd that I prefer slightly better than this cd.n be heard on this song!    \\"All Time Low\\" is an extended version song.

B004Q3SGWG|5.0|I was captivated and felt so much emotional connection to this movie. James Franco did an amazing job and deserved his Oscar Award nomination for his role.

B0042UD51A|5.0|When you have two Russian pianists of equally great stature but of very different temperament and the premier Polish orchestra under its distinguished music director assembled for a concert in honor of the composer's 200th birthday, you can expect something very special. This it is indeed. The 2010 concert, recorded in excellent (uncompressed, transparent) audio and video in Warsaw's National Philharmonic Hall, surpasses my high expectations. Nikolai Demidenko's technically perfect, introverted and thoughtful approach to the Piano Concerto No. 1 sheds new light onto the score and will make you re-think the work. Evgeny Kissin, dazzlingly emotional and extraverted, brings off the Second Concerto with incredible bravura. Antoni Wit and his Warsaw Philharmonic musicians treat Chopin's (admittedly not highly accomplished) scores with care, finesse and vigor. Theirs is about the most inspired performance of the orchestral parts I have ever heard. There are brilliant encores from the pianists and endless, well-deserved ovations. This is a DVD to treasure. Get it while you can.
B003Y5H5KQ|4.0|This is a great action adventure movie with a lovable heroine, a teenage girl was raised in the wilderness by her ex-CIA father.  She was trained to be skilled in violence, and taught all kinds of facts about the outside world, but she has never left her home in the forest.  Now she is sent out into the world on a deadly mission, and we are along for the ride.  I was expecting more of an action film, but overall I am glad the film instead focuses on the character of Hanna, and her personal journey to find her place in a world that isn't nearly as dangerous as she is.<br /><br />Hanna is a great character.  Visually she looks rather otherworldly, which drives home the point of her being an outsider.  From her faded appearance to her out of place clothes, she looks like someone who just doesn't belong.  And that's before she opens her mouth and starts spouting a bunch of random facts that she knows because her father read her encyclopedias instead of bedtime stories when she was little.  The only fiction in her upbringing was a book of Grimm's Fairy Tales.  (There are several references to fairy tales throughout the movie, and the plot is very much in that fanciful mold.)  But the thing that really separates Hanna from the world she is visiting is not how she was raised, but what she is.  She is a born killer, a person who is by nature more dangerous than the rest of humanity.  The film lets the action take a backseat when Hanna meets Sophie, a normal girl, and her family.  Her attempts to fit in and her discovery of just how different she is from everyone else gives the film its heart, as well as its few laughs.  Sometimes self-discovery can be more dangerous than fighting assassins.<br /><br />The film has a few flaws.  Most of these involve unanswered questions, and things that don't quite get resolved.  Put simply, it leaves you wanting a little more.  For instance, the villain of the piece seems like she has depths that are never fully explored.  You find out what she did to make her a target of our teenage assassin, but you never really get to know why she made the choices she did.  Her character remains largely a mystery even after the final credits roll.  And the ending, while very good, leaves you wondering where things go from there.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the movie a lot.  \\"Hanna\\" is a cool modern-day fairy tale, complete with the Wicked Witch.  But in this fairy tale, Hanna isn't some frail child lost in the woods.  She's the wolf.e her a target of our teenage assassin, but you never really get to know why she made the choices she did.  Her character remains largely a mystery even after the final credits roll.  And the ending, while very good, leaves you wondering where things go from there.

B001TODO54|5.0|Where can I start with Graceling? It has been so very long since I have picked up any decent fantasy (no, zombies and vampires don't count) that Graceling was a wonderful change of pace - and I am itching for more of its ilk! Kristin Cashore did such an awesome job with world-building of The Seven Kingdoms and created a rather interesting concept when it comes to Grace (which is, more or less, best described as talent i.e. being really good in something). Not everyone is Graced, but all who have a Grace have the signature 2-colored eyes although the 2 colors vary from person to person. Sometimes the Grace is very mundane such as climbing trees, while others such as Katsa's killing Grace can be used for political purposes by those in charge.<br /><br />There were times when I despaired at Katsa's obvious lack of social skills and thickheadedness when it comes to relationships. She was ten times worse than Alanna from The Song Of The Lioness quartet, but I bet she can kick Alanna's butt any day! :) Katsa was definitely 100% tomboy who detested silly frivolous dresses and hairdos. I admired her resourcefulness and drive to challenge herself and find her limits, whether it be wrestling with a goose in mid-air or trying different fighting scenarios and terrain with Po.<br /><br />One thing to note is that the plot started off a little slow, but steadily picked up the pace as Katsa and Po got closer to the truth behind the kidnapping. When the story finally reached the climax, can I just say that my jaw totally dropped in sheer incredulity because I cannot believe that just happened?!! Wow. The book almost fell out of my hands! Talk about a satisfying end for the villain! Talk about how evil I am for not elaborating any more! :}<br /><br />While I appreciated the ending, I was very surprised that there was still a lot more that happened after the climactic scene. I got a little upset with Po's tragedy - which, by the way, totally sucked - but I was very impressed with how he and Katsa adapted to this new challenge. Usually the protagonists emerge victorious without any major scrapes, but this was not the case for Graceling and I wonder what inspired Kristin Cashore to have the story take this unexpected direction.this new challenge.

B0032UYFA6|5.0|This show is perfect for marathon viewing, once you start watching, you can't stop at just one episode. This season has some of the most daring and pulse racing scenes I've ever seen on a television show. I won't mention any spoilers, but let me just say that at times I may have stopped breathing for a bit while I was watching what was happening on the screen. My only worry is that they may have almost jumped the shark at certain points in the season, I don't know how they'll top what happened in the 4th season. There is a lot of evolution in these characters, and maybe at times a growing insanity. I did like how they slightly redeemed the character of Walt's wife in the second half of the season. Also, I liked the fact that this time she was called out on her b*tchiness in the beginning of the season. The only thing I didn't love about this season, is that it ended with a cliffhanger unlike the previous two. It also sucks that now I'm caught up with the show, and I have to wait for the new episodes with everyone else. :)
0802798225|5.0|I really liked Brittany. She had a lot of spunk, and I admired her for caring enough for her sister's well-being to speak against sending her away to some assisted living center. She did not go out of her way to make fun of people and treated everyone with the same niceness if they returned the courtesy.<br /><br />Alex was the perfect Romeo to Brittany's Juliet. My heart also went out to him as he tried to figure out his future - Should he remain loyal to the Latino Blood gang, or should he try to pursue college? What sort of example should he set for his younger brothers? How is he going to keep them from following his footsteps?<br /><br />The chemistry between them was just WOWZERS, even when they were verbally sparring. If you are looking for a toe-curling, heart-melting romance, Perfect Chemistry delivers it with a lot of sizzle!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I really enjoyed the second season of Breaking Bad, it's definitely one of the craziest shows on tv. All of the characters do all the wrong things for all the right reasons, even when you can't believe what they're doing. I really loved all of the characters in the show except for Walt's wife. I wished at least one of the characters would have told her off. The whole show (but especially near the end) she acts like a total b*tch but no one calls her on it. I just found it very annoying and frustrating. The acting in the show is collectively superb, and they really maximize the genius of the original script. I can't wait to watch the 3rd season to see what happens.
B000FC1192|5.0|A pretty quick read, but very well-written as one can expect from Mr. Gaiman. Very creepy - almost too creepy for a children's books - I would say far creepier than Goosebumps! Not for the weak of heart or the overactive imagination!
1400052181|5.0|My mother died of cancer, in 1960, when I was a kid. I remember her vaguely, if at all, but I do remember hearing about the horrendous cancer treatments she underwent. After my father's death, 10 years later, I remember finding her autopsy report which stated she had had pancreatic cancer and that she had \\"remained optimistic to the end\\". I don't remember her as being optimistic. I remember a ghost-like figure lying in a hospital bed. So Henrietta Lacks' story had an additional element of interest for me. I can empathize with Deborah Lacks' search for her mother.     The author has been very successful at making a scientific subject accessible and readable. The book alternates between what is known of Henrietta's life, her family's difficult existence after her death, and the life of their own her cells took on subsequent to her death. Exciting, poignant and tragic by turns, examining issues of medical ethics, racism, the horrific treatment of people with learning disabilities and the politics of cancer.
0307346617|4.0|So let me warn you now: World War Z, while not outrageously spewing blood or maggots, is probably not for the weak of stomachs or imaginations.<br /><br />As I read World War Z, I could not help but compare this to a literary zombie movie. It would be very interesting indeed to listen to the audio version because I am sure it would be even more disturbing! Like I said, I literally had a nightmare after barely touching the book! Parts of the book flew over my head - the government/military lingo, the logistics - but other parts really stuck out to me where I can seriously see this happening if the Zombie War is on the brink of exploding into our lives.<br /><br />The discussions involved, the survival stories, the panic among everyone, the gold-diggers who made money on such panic, the silly celebrities who turn it into a reality show, the crazy humans with Stockholm syndrome and pretended to be zombies - Max Brooks weaves such an intricate and believable story that can satisfy any zombie lover and/or history buff. My boyfriend, while not as crazily Team Zombie as I am, loves The History Channel and I know in my gut that, even if he's zombie-skeptical, he can appreciate the details crafted together.<br /><br />I will admit that I may never re-read World War Z again. Once is enough for me, but perhaps I may check out the audio version or re-read after several years or so. Very detailed, very intricate - definitely something to keep in hand just in case.

0385474547|1.0|Um...    *clears throat* Ok, I have to approach this in linear fashion, or I'll just wind up screaming incomprehensibly at the computer.    \\"Turning and turning in the widening gyre  The falcon cannot hear the falconer;  Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;  Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,  The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere  The ceremony of innocence is drowned;  The best lack all conviction, while the worst  Are full of passionate intensity.\\"    So begins William Butler Yeats's poem \\"The Second Coming,\\" one of my favorite poems in the English language, up there with Browning's terrifying \\"My Last Duchess\\" and Tennyson's haunting \\"Morgiana\\" (many people prefer \\"Ulysses\\"). I shall take this moment to point out that Achebe's use of an Irish poet's work to reflect the breakdown of African culture (by white people, some undoubtedly Irish) is ironic in the extreme, and not very apt.    The subtext of Yeats's poem is World War I, where over 10 million people died in a very short span of years. It is the second-largest catastrophe the world has experienced, and would have been the worst if World War II had not come along. (Ongoing African genocides are also terrible tragedies, but Achebe does not mention those.) Comparing the breakdown of an extremely sexist, superstitious and ignorant group via missionaries to one of the worst events in human history is grandiose at best. Even though I don't agree with what the missionaries did, they saved twins and treated women and children far better than the traditional Igbo people.    (Aside: I was always taught to notice how people treat others who have less power than them. When out at a restaurant, for instance, if your date treats the waiter like less of a human being, then they're probably not worth your time. Treating people who have less power than you as if they are inferior people is a sin of both the Igbo people *and* the missionaries in the novel, but the rampant sexism of the Igbo seems to me toshow more than the way their society functions--I counted over 150 instances of extremely sexist language in this book before the 100th page. Then I gave up counting. That, my friends, is overkill. End aside.)    Yeats condemns \\"passionate intensity,\\" and yet this is what Okonkwo seems to represent for much of the novel, when he isn't wife-beating and killing children. His suicide is a huge breaking point in the novel, but it seems to me almost out of character. One of the only things I really admired about Okonwko was his fighting spirit.    *deep breath* Anyway, I'm glad the novel's done with. It contained pages upon pages of pointless sexism and violence. Even if that represents Igbo society with perfect accuracy (which I doubt), the author did not have to affirm such behavior with his narrative voice. There are ways of writing about victims of oppression without condoning that oppression; Stephen R. Donaldson writes empowering stuff about victims all the time, and he's the son of an orthopedic surgeon who did missionary work. He saw suffering Indians firsthand, and still manages to gift his characters with an aura of dignity that Achebe's characters utterly lack.    \\"Things Fall Apart\\" is far and above the most overtly sexist book I have ever read in my life, bar none. I've read stuff from five--no, *eight*--hundred years ago that gave us female characters with more spine.

1594202842|5.0|[Abbreviated from original, but suffice to note that Amazon verifies the purchase.]    It reminds me a little bit of Indian-American comedian Russell Peters. When Russell mocks his father's racism or accent, for example, we all understand that Russell has exaggerated his father's characteristics to make a joke. That Russell is partly endorsing, partly criticizing, and mostly just explaining the culture he comes from. While trying to be funny.     Amy Chua, too, is making fun of an Asian parent. It just happens that she herself is the parent.     * * * *     That's not to say that she doesn't mean anything here -- far from it. She obviously means the vast majority of what she wrote.     She clearly endorses high expectations; believing in your child's ability; driving her daughter harder than Lulu would naturally drive herself. She believes in practice leading to excellence. And she obviously believes that rhetoric is simply different among Chinese and Western parents.     And she makes those points while being witty and entertaining along the way. She exaggerates to make a point -- and, mostly, to be funny. Can't we extract those lessons without taking her literally at every single point along the way?

B001PJRAUS|5.0|THANK YOU!<br /><br />I am totally grateful to be absolutely FREE of any and all tendency to compare this movie with the original novel and be disappointed as a result. The original Austen novel serves as fodder.<br /><br />Think of it this way: Amanda is thrust \\"back in time\\" to a FICTIONAL WORLD: in other words, a world that simply never existed except in her own mind! What makes the movie so enjoyable is that it is truly Amanda's story and not some crappy thing being shoehorned into Austen's original work. The revelations are about Amanda, how she thinks, how she reacts, how she adapts. It is not about Pride and Prejudice any more. Suspend your disbelief and be Amanda for a short while.<br /><br />As for wishing you could see Amanda bumbling around in a story that more closely resembled Pride and Prejudice, gosh, I would not wish that on the most forgiving of Austen fans. It is much more fun to watch Amanda struggle in a \\"fictional reality\\" that does not at all resemble her expectations.<br /><br />Austen makes Henry Tilney say in Northanger Abbey that a novel is \\"only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed to the world in the best-chosen language.\\" For Austen, that meant one thing. For this movie, it means something entirely different, and as far as I am concerned, they succeeded quite well in that quality that matters most in a movie: it entertained me.<br /><br />Yes. I expected to dislike the movie. But I liked it quite a lot.
1439152780|2.0|This book never got going. The pace is very slow, with way too many details that are of no importance.
0452286751|5.0|Rourk is the man (woman) we all want to be. Quiet, immensely confident, and completely satisfied with himself and his life. He is the antithesis of \\"keeping up with the jones\\". He looks at many of the hollywood/elite types not as something to be revered but as the disfunctional narcissist they are. He is, however, almost too perfect, but that is ok because I think we can all learn something from him. For instance, whether you are a CEO of a fortune 500 company or a janitor, you should take pride in what you do and never let anyone make you think your title is indicative of your status in society. That is not to say that certain jobs are not more functionally important, but as Rourk showed in his relationship with Mike the electrician, you should treat a person as your equal based on the pride they take in their work.    The only part that seemed too far-fetched was Rourk's action (and the resulting consequences) involving the government housing complex he designed. I don't think anyone, particulalry post-911 and Oklahoma, would see that action as justified or right.     Even so, the book is fantastic and is the second best book I have ever read (Darkness at Noon being the first). I highly recommend it.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I was so happy to receive this movie, delivery time was better than expected and the condtion of the movie was excellent.  I'd buy here again anytime!!
B001QWBM62|4.0|I bought the H4n to replace a missing H2n.  This is a larger, heavier unit with better, more intuitive controls.  I'm not wild about the way Zoom handles some of their menu functions, but I guess it's just a matter of getting used to it.  Other reviewers have provided excellent information on the pro's and con's of the H4n.  It's clearly a quality piece of gear.<br /><br />I've also purchased a Zoom H1 which is a much smaller, highly portable, inexpensive recorder.  At ninety nine dollars, it is also a sweet unit when small size and being inconspicuous is important.
0321344758|5.0|I had a friend recommend Don't Make Me Think and I have to say, it is in fact a great read. Read it once, keep all the ideas in mind, and when you have trouble designing, look at the book for reference.
B004A8ZWT2|4.0|The Tourist    What a relief ... to see a movie that isn't just one special effect after another (spectacular explosions, car's crashing all over the place, etc.) but instead,  a plot with mystery and humor ..... no robots or monsters created by a twisted  character wanting to conquer the earth.    Try viewing this one a second time with that in mind.  Relax and enjoy .... not that it doesn't have action ... it does.    The ever versatile  Johnny Depp portrays yet another type of character, deliberately dull, with flashes of charisma.  Angelina Jolie was fun in this one, outwitting those who were trying to follow her, obviously enjoying the game.   Pay attention to the quiet banter between Depp and Jolie ... it does contribute to the general atmosphere of this movie.    Fun moments ... a chase across tile rooftops, barefoot and in pyjamas, no less.  A 'rescue', being dragged behind a speedboat, and a somewhat disappointing result for the frumphy \\"hero\\" to what seemed to be promising in the hotel ....    The villains are nasty characters, of course, what else?    As for me; I have added The Tourist to my Depp collection, still fascinated by his versatility.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I don't really know what else to say about this one. There's absolutely nothing wrong with it. This album has everything- charm, edge, wit, sarcasm, soul, encouragement, and of course, love! It's so creative!! I can listen to Little Voice over and over and never get bored with it. Order it now!

B004U8VWLE|5.0|If you enjoy dance, watch this movie. It actually has amazing dancing and acting, which is rare for dance movies.
B004G6009U|5.0|Tangled is an excellent movie on many levels: 1)excellent story 2)great characters and acting 3)INCREDIBLE animation(!) 4)very good music. I'm very surprised this movie didn't generate more \\"buzz.\\" This movie really is one of the best non-Pixar Disney animated movies since Lion King.  It's simply a piece of quality entertainment that should make Disney Animation proud.     Then, there's the blu-ray edition.  WOW!  This film must be seen in hi-def.  The attention to detail is really amazing.  Rapunzel's hair is unbelievably detailed.  There is so much eye candy in the movie that just the graphics alone deserve repeated viewings.      If you're an animation fan and haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor and watch it--especially, if you have access to blu-ray.    Simply an amazing piece of entertainment that makes the long history of quality Disney animation proud.
B003VR5PPY|3.0|As many other reviewers have said, this game has a really good story.  It has interesting characters, several plot twists, and a unique premise.  Where this game falls flat in its face is the gameplay department.    Since this game is like 90% text, you should note that the text on this game moves painfully slow.  The dialogue is on the top screen, while the character's inner thoughts and actions are on the bottom screen.  This setup makes it read just like a book, and with such basic graphics, it will make you wish this had just been a book.  This game limits your reading speed so much that it will frustrate you, especially during slower parts of the story.  It takes around 2-3 seconds to display 2 lines across the DS (which isn't that wide).  Now, I am not an extremely experienced reader so I imagine this fact ruins it even more for speed readers who want to absorb the story quickly.    It wouldn't even be so much of a problem if at least it didn't happen during the actual puzzle-solving.  You'll pull a lever or something and suddenly you get like 4 minutes of internal monologuing and dialogue, making it easy to forget what the hell you were doing or just mashing the A button furiously so you can continue the puzzle.  It's even worse in the beginning of the game, where a long set of instructions is given every single time you click on something.   For example, in the beginning you are required to find a code to enter into a number pad.  The first time you click on the pad, the game will give you a 45 second tutorial on how to enter digits (no, seriously - apparently \\"click on the number\\" needs to be explained).  Then, once you figure out what number to punch in, you click on the pad again.. and it gives you the entire list of instructions again!  This happens many times and there is no way to skip it or make it faster.    The game does get better after you beat it once since it allows you to dramatically speed up text you have already seen.  However, any new scenes you encounter will go back to the painful slow method.      All in all, I do recommend this game if you are looking for a decent story; just be aware that the slowness will no doubt frustrate you.
1608191664|5.0|XXXXX<br /><br />\\"As I will show throughout this book, the 'truths' peddled by free-market ideologues are based on lazy assumptions and blinkered visions, if not...self-serving notions.  My aim in this book is to tell you some essential truths about capitalism that the free-marketers won't.<br /><br />This book is not an anti-capitalist manifesto...My criticism is of a particular version of capitalism that has dominated the world in the last three decades, that is, free-market capitalism...<br /><br />This book is intended to equip the reader with an understanding of how capitalism REALLY works and how it can be made to work better...<br /><br />Most of the issues I discuss in this book do not have simple answers.  Indeed, in many cases, my main point is that there is no simple answer, unlike what free-market economists want you to believe.\\"<br /><br />The above comes from the introduction of this enthralling book by Ha-Joon Chang.  Chang is an economics professor at the University of Cambridge and author.  In 2005, he won the Leontief Prize for Advancing the Frontiers of Economic Thought.<br /><br />Here are the titles of some of the book chapters (that are the same as the \\"things\\"):<br /><br />(1) There is no such thing as a free market<br />(2) Companies should NOT be run in the interest of their owners<br />(3) Most people in rich countries are paid more than they should be<br />(4) The washing machine has changed the world more than the Internet has<br />(5) The U.S. does not have the highest living standard in the world<br />(6) Making rich people richer doesn't make the rest of us richer<br />(7) People in poor countries are more entrepreneurial than people in rich countries<br />(8) More education in itself is not going to make a country richer<br />(9) What is good for General Motors is not necessarily good for the United States<br />(10) We are not smart enough to leave things to the market<br /><br />Chang begins each chapter with a brief section entitled \\"What they tell you.\\"  In other words, this is the standard answer with regard to a particular thing that free-market capitalists and economists tell us.  (For those who read the literature, these are called \\"Homo Economicicus\\" answers.)<br /><br />Chang counter-balances this first section with another brief section entitled \\"What they don't tell you.\\"  In this section we're told the problems with the \\"What they tell you\\" section.<br /><br />For example, consider thing (1) above which states that \\"There is no such thing as a free market.  The standard answer or Homo Economicus answer given in the \\"What they tell you\\" section is:<br /><br />\\"Markets need to be free.  When the government interferes to dictate what market participants can or cannot do, resources cannot flow to their most efficient use.  If people cannot do the things that they find most profitable, they lose the incentive to invest and innovate.\\"  (This section goes on for a few more sentences.)<br /><br />Chang tells us in the section \\"What they don't tell you\\" for this thing, the following:<br /><br />\\"The free market doesn't exist.  Every market has some rules and boundaries that restrict freedom of choice.  A market looks free only because we so unconditionally accept its underlying restrictions that we fail to see them.\\"  (This section goes on for a few more sentences.)<br /><br />You can actually read the entire book just by reading these two sections.  However, I wouldn't recommend this since Chang elaborates on the \\"What they don't tell you\\" sections with historical examples, appealing to logic, etc.  In my opinion, these elaborations are superb and make this book the gem that it is.<br /><br />Finally, Chang concludes his book with eight principles for redesigning our economic system.  Again, these are excellent (but perhaps too idealistic).<br /><br />In conclusion,  I urge you to read how Ha-Joon Chang in his book slays the fundamental theoretical assumptions of free-market capitalism!!<br/><br />(first published 2010;  7 ways to read this book;  acknowledgements;  introduction;  23 chapters or things;  conclusion;  main narrative 265 pages;  notes;  index)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX/><br />(first published 2010;  7 ways to read this book;  acknowledgements;  introduction;  23 chapters or things;  conclusion;  main narrative 265 pages;  notes;  index)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX
B002ZG976U|3.0|Took too long to get here and DVD freezes in the middle and has to be skipped over. Will not order again.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I find it very hard to see so many folks give things that haven't even been released a bad rating, as this very product has. Unless there is a serious technical issue or you don't like the film at all, there is no reason to place a review, but don't do that before you watch it. It may be one of the most familiar movie series ever, but that doesn't mean if you've seen it you should be leaving a review here until you've watched this specific edition.     To clarify the special edition that this product is claiming to be, without the originals (1977 to 1983) to many peoples dismay, few seem to realize that George Lucas himself was never content with what he had available when he first made the original three films decades ago. He was very limited, and he hoped to one day make his imagination more of a reality. That dream came true in the late 90's when he made the special editions and re-released them. After many complaints of people who were very attached to the originals, and to show how much he cared about the preservation of its cultural heritage, he had to release the originals alongside the specials. Frankly, I prefer the specials; they are what the original creator wanted to do in the first place, it's more attractive, and makes the depiction of the Star Wars universe more vivid. But personal opinion aside, it's not right to leave reviews for a product that has not come out yet. If it wasn't for Star Wars, most of all other science fiction that followed wouldn't exist, aside from a few classics. At the very least, sci-fi would be a lot different these days. If anything, the constant updates and the special editions have strengthened the franchise to show newer generations what true science fiction is, and can be.    That's not to say George Lucas was without opinion about the alteration of original films. In a congressional speech in 1988, George Lucas himself, with other directions such as Steven Spielberg and Woody Allen, spoke out against the alteration of original art in film and how technology and the industry as a whole does not protect original works. This is a very powerful speech by George Lucas himself. Keep in mind while reading though that it's not countering what he later did to Star Wars, as he himself, the creator, altered his own vision, and still had the dignity to release the originals alongside them, which many creators will not due if a film is altered or remade:    \\"My name is George Lucas. I am a writer, director, and producer of motion pictures and Chairman of the Board of Lucasfilm Ltd., a multi-faceted entertainment corporation.    I am not here today as a writer-director, or as a producer, or as the chairman of a corporation. I've come as a citizen of what I believe to be a great society that is in need of a moral anchor to help define and protect its intellectual and cultural heritage. It is not being protected.    The destruction of our film heritage, which is the focus of concern today, is only the tip of the iceberg. American law does not protect our painters, sculptors, recording artists, authors, or filmmakers from having their lifework distorted, and their reputation ruined. If something is not done now to clearly state the moral rights of artists, current and future technologies will alter, mutilate, and destroy for future generations the subtle human truths and highest human feeling that talented individuals within our society have created.    A copyright is held in trust by its owner until it ultimately reverts to public domain. American works of art belong to the American public; they are part of our cultural history.    People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society. The preservation of our cultural heritage may not seem to be as politically sensitive an issue as \\"when life begins\\" or \\"when it should be appropriately terminated,\\" but it is important because it goes to the heart of what sets mankind apart. Creative expression is at the core of our humanness. Art is a distinctly human endeavor. We must have respect for it if we are to have any respect for the human race.    These current defacements are just the beginning. Today, engineers with their computers can add color to black-and-white movies, change the soundtrack, speed up the pace, and add or subtract material to the philosophical tastes of the copyright holder. Tommorrow, more advanced technology will be able to replace actors with \\"fresher faces,\\" or alter dialogue and change the movement of the actor's lips to match. It will soon be possible to create a new \\"original\\" negative with whatever changes or alterations the copyright holder of the moment desires. The copyright holders, so far, have not been completely diligent in preserving the original negatives of films they control. In order to reconstruct old negatives, many archivists have had to go to Eastern bloc countries where American films have been better preserved.    In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be \\"replaced\\" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.    There is nothing to stop American films, records, books, and paintings from being sold to a foreign entity or egotistical gangsters and having them change our cultural heritage to suit their personal taste.    I accuse the companies and groups, who say that American law is sufficient, of misleading the Congress and the People for their own economic self-interest.    I accuse the corporations, who oppose the moral rights of the artist, of being dishonest and insensitive to American cultural heritage and of being interested only in their quarterly bottom line, and not in the long-term interest of the Nation.    The public's interest is ultimately dominant over all other interests. And the proof of that is that even a copyright law only permits the creators and their estate a limited amount of time to enjoy the economic fruits of that work.    There are those who say American law is sufficient. That's an outrage! It's not sufficient! If it were sufficient, why would I be here? Why would John Houston have been so studiously ignored when he protested the colorization of \\"The Maltese Falcon?\\" Why are films cut up and butchered?    Attention should be paid to this question of our soul, and not simply to accounting procedures. Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.    I hope you have the courage to lead America in acknowledging the importance of American art to the human race, and accord the proper protection for the creators of that art--as it is accorded them in much of the rest of the world communities.\\"    As you can see, just any special edition is not a worthy successor to an original. I originally found this at this site, [...] , to cite my source. To the authenticity, I will say it's probably quite real, but this site tries to use it as an argument against Star Wars special editions all together, however it's quite biased and should be taken in that respect. But again, Star Wars was originally conceived and made a reality because of George Lucas. Despite who worked with him on the originals and who weren't around to help with the specials, or whomever didn't agree with them when we created them, he did in fact do it himself, which is more than what many movie \\"re-designers\\" have done in the past. He didn't deface his own film, but simply improved what he wanted to do in the first place.    Do the creator a favor, and a favor to the future readers of a product that isn't even out until September 2011, and review intelligently, when you actually experience the product yourself. I'm leaving this review to boost the rating of a product that, unless there is serious technical, hardware, or packaging issues, shouldn't have such a low rating, especially before it comes out.    That said, I'll definitely pre-order this. Can't wait!
159420229X|5.0|One of the best things about this book is that you enjoy reading it.  it isn't a dry book of instructions on how to remember, but a journey, written with humor and surprise, about remembering and what the pieces are.

B003ZHR6T8|4.0|Want to see a film that will put you off living in Los Angeles for life? Look no further. As a kid I always saw the City of Angels as a glamorous, exotic place, since most movies back then were set there. But upon watching falling down at the age of 14 I went off it completely. I no longer saw it as a bustling metropolis of wealth and sunshine, but as a fragmented, angry, unjust place barely able to call itself a society.<br /><br />Michael Douglas stars as William Foster, a middle-aged, middle-management schlub working at a defense company who suddenly finds himself obsolete in an increasingly chaotic, senseless world. Stuck in heavy traffic one morning, he suddenly snaps, leaves his car, and crosses LA on foot en route to his daughter's birthday party. Along the way he has many encounters with what sadly passes as modern humanity. Only now he's just not going to sit by and tolerate it. He's not choosing apathy like the rest of his fellow citizens. Foster (or D-FENS) fights back face to face, unapologetically, And you know what...he's right every time.<br /><br />Robert Duvall plays Prendergast, the cop who puts together the pieces of D-Fens' rampage. The two men are as far apart as they are so close, but none of the LAPD care much for Prendergast's suspicions.<br /><br />The lazy, arrogant, ignorant, disinterested cops are the only weak link in Ebbe Roe Smith's otherwise tight screenplay (you might remember him as 'Jim Bob' in Fletch Lives). Creating stupid characters to further the drama is just too easy, and every time one of them speaks it really drags the movie down.<br /><br />Joel Schumacher's career has been filled with ups and downs (Batman and Robin certainly ain't one of the 'ups'), but Falling Down proves that he can be a good director when he wants to, regardless of how wildly inconsistent his track record is. James Newton Howard also contributes a nice score (which has never been released), but really this is Douglas' film. He's often funny without even meaning to be. D-Fens is just speaking his mind, but still his views come across as controversial or intolerant. If only more people had the courage to take a stand against injustice in real life instead of 'just dealing with it'.<br /><br />Idiot cop characters aside, Falling Down is one of Douglas's best, and perhaps more relevant now than it was in 1993.<br /><br />The Blu Ray is in 2.40:1 1080p with Dolby TrueHD stereo sound and is a MASSIVE step-up from the awful DVD. A commentary and interview with Douglas is also included.en meaning to be. D-Fens is just speaking his mind, but still his views come across as controversial or intolerant.

B004E2XAFW|3.0|I was really looking forward to a new album from Within Temptation since I thought their previous albums combined beautiful vocals with excellent music compositions, if a little simple for prog.  This album, however, disappoints.  I don't find anything new here; in fact, I would argue that it's a step back for WT compared to their earliest days when their music was supposed to be much less sophisticated (excluding The Heart of Everything!).  The compositions here are unoriginal and music is dull.  Sorry, but I got bored about half way through the CD and started looking for other music right away.  Now I can't make myself go back to it.  I will just have to keep listening to their previous albums and hope they come up with something more inventive than The Unforgiving next time.  3 stars for Sharon's voice.
B003UESJHY|5.0|Great movie and Christian Bale deserved an Oscar for his performance in The Fighters.  The shipper mist this BluRay DVD in the first package, but over-nighted a copy (at no expense) when I told them it was missing from the package.  Now that's a comeback.
B001UV4XI8|2.0|The Digital Copy is practically unwatchable with all the macroblocking.  The voices are totally lost in the mix so you'll deafen yourself turning the volume up to hear it.  The DVD is no better.  I seriously can't believe that WB felt like this was an appropriate way to handle their cash cow.
B0040ZA2D6|4.0|I bought this CD for my niece who just LOVES Big Time Rush. The lyrics are all positive and suitable for young as well as older kids. It is pure pop but it is GREAT to dance to as many of my niece's friends were doing (ages 4 through 7) at her Birthday Party. The adults were even dancing to these songs too! It is a FUN Cd for everyone, period!
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|When I first read that there wasn't an acoustic guitar or ballad to be heard on this album, it reminded me of \\"One by One,\\" and \\"In Your Honor's\\" electric half, in a bad way. They had their share of excellent songs, but just weren't consistent from start to end. Turns out that \\"Wasting Light\\" is easily the most consistent, solid, and enjoyable Foo Fighters album since \\"Colour and the Shape.\\"    While the early press had this pegged as their \\"heaviest\\" ever, they've still never done any pounding, brutal stuff since the likes of \\"My Poor Brain\\" or \\"Wind Up.\\" It might be more fair to say that it's the \\"hardest\\" one they've done. Sadly, there's also no surprises like \\"Ain't It the Life\\" or \\"Virginia Moon,\\" but the band has focused on its hard-rock roots and shown that they do it better than anyone.    With three guitarists now, all are utilized to great effect, most notably on songs like \\"Back and Forth\\" where a guitar is added one at a time. And when each play distinctly different parts, it makes the album better with each listen. The entire band has produced the most energetic and tightest material yet.    \\"Bridge Burning\\" starts and ends aggressively, but the subdued vocals on the chorus took away from the song for me. \\"Rope\\" was probably my least favorite based on the early live performances, but this first single grew on me, and that riff is hard to resist.    \\"Dear Rosemary\\" is unlike what the band has done before... dark and haunting, but still rocks. The insane \\"White Limo\\" certainly evokes the self-titled album, but has a more full and complex sound. (Nobody has any idea what Dave's saying, but everyone's too busy rocking out to really care.) \\"Arlandria\\" is another haunting, almost sinister song that use the old soft-loud dynamic with great results.    \\"These Days\\" is the closest thing here to a ballad, with its delicate riff, but the scornful chorus dedicated to an ex-lover turns it on its head. The bridge and outro feel too formulaic, however, making it justshort of an all-time great.    \\"Back and Forth\\" and \\"Matter of Time\\" are fun, infectious pop-punk, which the band does masterfully (\\"Cheer Up Boys\\" and \\"The Last Song\\" being other examples). Some diehard fans may not be as keen on these, but I'd be perfectly happy if either became a future single.    \\"Miss the Misery\\" was one song that felt like filler after the fact, but each time I hear it again I'm reminded it's actually pretty awesome, and the second half is just explosive. \\"I Should Have Known\\" is so raw, sparse, and personal it's not something I'd listen to each time through the album. It's a good sign when the song you'd hear the least is still excellent.    While all the above are great, I wasn't sure if any ranked up there with their previous classics. \\"Walk\\" does. If the first minute doesn't grab you by the heart, it will before it's over. I have no idea if it's the riffs, the lyrics, or the vocals, but there's something here that's both life-affirming and yet heartbreaking, and darn it if it doesn't get me all choked up each time. Hopefully this becomes a big single, because it truly deserves a Grammy nomination for best song/record. It's that good.    If it's true that rock and roll is a dying art, \\"Wasting Light\\" shows that this band is one of the few left who refuses to go down without a fight.
1439102724|5.0|Jodi Picoult is one of my favorite authors.  It's a love that began when I saw the movie The Pact.  I quickly read ALL of her books.  When I heard she was writing such a controversial book...I was kind of scared.  I'm as open-minded as they come.  So, don't get me wrong.  I just didn't know if she could pull it off.  She did.    I love the characters in this book.  Every one of them. I loved Zoe and her spunk the most.  Her patients amazed me and broke my heart at the same time.  The facts about music therapy peppered throughout the book opened my eyes.  I'm a huge fan of music and know it's theraputic, but it was amazing to think of how it transformed these characters. I even kind of liked Max, I especially liked being able to see inside of his mind and have my eyes opened to what someone who sees homosexuality as a sin might think.    The music accompanying the book brought me to tears.  Let's just say I'm super sensitive.  I cry very easily.  But how can you not cry during a book where the first sentence is \\"One sunny, crisp Saturday in September when I was seven years old, I watched my father drop dead.\\"  The book also made me laugh, many times.  The ending wrapped things up nicely, and didn't seemed forced.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|Wonderful film! One of the best from the past couple of years. I'm totally baffled why it was panned by the critics and bombed at the box office. Judging by the ratings here on Amazon, it looks like most people are coming around to the joys of this film!

B004LUHQ1G|3.0|given the hype prior to relase I figured this thing was gonna be THE gnarliest album ever, like Foo Fighters meets Probot or something. It mostly sounds like Cheap Trick castoffs done up heavy and way to glossy. I still say Grohl's best moments (Nirvana, Them Crooked Vultures, Killing Joke) are when he's on the drumstool. Given his pedigree, the band's talent and their collective musical smarts I expected ALOT more than just another power pop album - a good one, but too \\"radio friendly\\" and calculated for me. Add more dirt next time.

Despite the high level of detail and depth the book goes into, beginners will find the book easy to use and not incredibly overwhelming, although beginners with a mind for exercise science and kinesiology will find it easiest to digest.    The illustrations in Pilates Anatomy are beautiful - very clear, detailed and instructive. The one thing that I did find difficult to understand was the distributions of weight during the exercises - it's hard to know where the muscle tension is distributed during each exercise.    Overall, this book is a wonderful resources for those who love Pilates and kinesiology. If you're interested in reading a more comprehensive review, check it out at: [...]
B002O1TMI4|5.0|I have loved MUSE since Showbiz was released. I love this album. If you just hear \\"Exogenesis: Symphony Part 3 (Redemption)\\" it will take your breath away. I have followed this band for years and trust me this is amazing. its not like there other cds because its not suppose to be. its not music for the masses. Its not radio music. Most of there music is edited for radio or movies. So don't let that damn twilight movies fool you.
0812550706|4.0|The cover of this novel does it no favors whatsoever as it's insipid and firmly rooted in the sc-fi genre. It's a shame because the story told is very much a psychological masterpiece. However, if you're not a science fiction fan this cover isn't very likely to draw you in as it only screams \\"SCI-FI!!!!\\" in your face...then by the wayside it no doubt falls. So let me make this perfectly clear; even though it has it's roots in sci-fi 'Ender's Game' is far more than a novel based in that particular genre.  Andrew 'Ender' Wiggins is a child genius who is recruited, at a very young age, by the military to be trained in the art of war for an ongoing battle with an alien race known as the 'Buggers'. Due to Ender being a genius at such a young age he is shunned by the majority of other kids. Even at the military academy which is full of slightly older children, who are also being trained due to their own high IQs, he is often an object of scorn and jealousy which makes him focus even more on his education. The education often takes the form of various games. These games range from out and out military combat exercises to computer simulations and games that vigorously test his mental skills and reasoning. It's in this psychological aspect that the story excels as we're dragged into Ender's world, Ender's mind, and get to know everything that he is thinking and the logic behind his reasoning. As Ender is very much a sympathetic figure, and constantly bullied, we feel his pain and revel in his triumphs when he outsmarts those who torment him.  Even though Andrew Wiggins is taken away from his family at a young age we never lose touch with his siblings as his older, psychotic brother, and his polar opposite sister who are both geniuses in their own right, form the basis of a back story which intertwines with Ender's story at various points throughout the book. Neither his brother or sister made it to the military academy due to psychological faults. His brother, Peter, is borderline psychotic and prone to constant violent acts. His sister, Valentine, is very passive and both of their personality traits play a major part in the novel.  It's only towards the end that the novel truly becomes sci-fi with space battles and colonizing of new worlds but even if you are not a science fiction fan you will have been hooked long before then and will be turning the pages with such gusto they will leave friction marks on your fingers.  This truly is a great work of literature that deserved the Hugo and Nebula awards which were bestowed upon it. As for Ender you would be hard pressed to find a more wonderfully orchestrated character in any genre of literature; Card, through his words, waves the baton and we eagerly listen attentive and on the edge of our seats to Ender's symphony that the author expertly conducts.
0307341577|5.0|I loved how the back story unfolded as Libby interviewed and discovered more and more about the past and what really did happen.  That being said, I didn't like Libby.  I felt sorry for her, but I didn't like her.  That makes me sound cold, she had her entire life ripped from her at a young age, but I found her to be too whiny and didn't like how she used everyone in her life.  That being said, I've already recommended this book to several people.  The character I most felt connected with was Patty, the mother.  She was struggling to make ends meet, she feared for her children's future and as events unfolded I found myself feeling more and more sorry for her.  Some of the scenes were a bit gruesome, but you are dealing with what is to be believed to be a satanic ritualistic killing of two young girls and their mother.  It's well written and definitely worth checking out.
B004WMKSH2|1.0|The video quality was terrible.  The whole bottom half of the movie was below the viewing area on the screen.  All you could see were the tops of the movie character's heads.  Don't waste your money.  I ended up watching the movie on Direct TV during a tornado and got better video quality.

1400052181|2.0|I am surprised by the positive reviews that I see posted.  I disliked this book.  Here's why:    1.  Embedded deeply into the fabric of this book is the author's own ambition.  She is a tenacious reporter.  She wanted a story.  This book is actually about the author's pursuit of her story, her book.  The book is sold to us as a mediation on ethics, genetics and race.  Those subjects are secondary -- and not presented in a particularly interesting way.  For good reason.  As discussed below, there's just not that much good material about which to write.  The issues are straight-forward and not current.  So, instead, we have a book about the author's attempt to gain the confidence of a family so she could obtain strands of information that might be stitched together to form a narrative.  The reader gains the distinct impression that the author gained the confidence of the Lacks family to exploit the Lacks family -- again, so the author would have her book.    2.  The Lacks family (to which the author devotes more than half the book) is not interesting.  Yes, it is poor.  It lives in poverty.  Its members have not had opportunity, try to scratch by and sometimes end up in jail.  Unfortunately, millions of American families share these characteristics.  We know that.  We frequently read about underprivileged families and in many different contexts.  But the Lacks family offers no deep insights.  Its observations about science, justice and money are re-stated over and over again, and they are often steeped in ignorance.    3.  The Lacks family (the protagonists of this story) are not particularly likable.  Its focus is, primarily, money.  Page after page, we read about its desire for compensation.      4.  There's very little in this book that quantities, or even meaningfully explains, how Henrietta Lacks' cells have helped us.  We know they have been used for research.  We know they were sent up into space.  But descriptions of the cells' scientific and medical uses arevague and general.    5.  The central ethical issue presented in this book -- the practice of using peoples' cells for research without their consent -- just isn't that interesting.  The reason is simple:  the cell of an individual isn't the individual himself or herself.  They're cells.  Nothing more.  But the book, while sometimes drawing this distinction, more often conflates the obvious difference between the individual and his or her extracted cells.      6.  The book doesn't have a strong narrative thrust.  There is no suspense, no climax, no denouement.  The book jumps from decade to decade for no obvious reason.  The ending of the book centers around the fate of someone whose motives were mixed and who didn't say a single interesting thing.   I finished the book, but I really had to work at it.  I kept on hoping the ending of the book would bring some satisfaction, but it just fizzled.    7.  There are no clear heroes in the book.  There are no villains.  This reflects well on the author because she obviously didn't bend the truth to make interesting characters. But it makes for a pretty boring book.    8.   The only mystery in the book is left unresolved.  It pertains to money.  The Lacks family wants money.  The author established a foundation for the family.  But there's no indication how the foundation benefits the family.  Rather, the book vaguely states that \\"some of the proceeds of this book are being donated by the author to the Foundation.\\"  So, we are left to wonder.  How much did the Lacks family enrich the author?  How much did she benefit from the Lacks' story -- in much the same way that science and medicine benefited from Henrietta Lacks' cells?  How much money has the Lacks family made as a result of the publication of this best-selling book?  A lot or a little?    9.  The book is poorly edited.  It is redundant is so many ways.  The author repeats the family's conspiracy theories and talks about its resentments dozens of times.  This 300-page book could have been 100 pages shorter -- easily.    10.  The book is condescending to the reader.  It assumes that we will buy, and revel in, a book that purports to be about science, morality and race, but that we will not critically scrutinize whether the book actually delivers.  The fact that this book has been so well reviewed and has appeared on so many best-seller lists suggests that this cynicism was warranted.
0440237688|1.0|I bought this based on all the positive reviews and the fact it was a Newberry Medal winner.  However, after reading it, I'm not sure I really trust the judgement of the Newberry Medal now.  As one of the negative reviews I read mentioned, any book that portrays a society nonchalantly 'releasing' newborn infants to maintain the order of things should not be a 'children's' book.  There are other young adult books that depict this type of apocalyptic society just fine without resorting to that level of monstrosity.  I did not feel enlightened at all upon finishing the book....just depressed and sorry I wasted my time and money.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I picked this up here because I loved the movies, or at least the versions that I had seen on TV, and wow did they outdo themselves with the blu-ray.  Not only can you watch the original releases, but the directors cut on each movie disc.  I for one like to watch and see the ride the director intended, not the ride the studio decided to give us.  The special features discs are filled with so much stuff I can not even begin to tell all of it.  On the downside, I had to spend a bit to update my outdated blu ray player to enjoy these films, but now that its current I can watch them again and again.  For the price I paid, it was WELL worth it.
B00028U6B8|4.0|This was a problem. Up to this record it was mostly about the music. I wasn't asleep--I got gathered up in the sense of the time. Suddenly, I wasn't hardcore enough for those who fancied themselves revolutionaries and Volunteers. I thought many of them were pretentious and just a little disingenuous--considering most of them came from Long Island and had more money than I. So in the ridiculousness of it all I missed the Music. Which is why I was there. With the passage of the decades I can finally appreciate the songs without all the political baggage. For me it got in the way--for others it was the only reason. Oh, well. Speaking of politics--they should get back together and do Volunteers Two. We have much more to worry about NOW.
0385342047|4.0|As a 29-year-old mother of two, including a 22-month-old little girl who hasn't learned \\"Mine\\" but definitely \\"Unnnhhh\\" meaning want and shakes her head no, I am alarmed by the posts screaming Sophie Kinsella's character Becky Bloomwood is irresponsible, a horrible mother, and tiring. Ask any honest mother of a toddler and yes, we've all had those days where we can't resist splurging on our child and being embarrassed by our kid smearing something, breaking something, or throwing a tantrum. It happens. It doesn't make anyone a bad mom.<br /><br />One review doesn't get why Luke could still be with Becky after all of the misadventures. Marriage is about accepting your partner's faults, and it's clear that is why Becky and Luke's marriage works. I have been waiting to read about Minnie and the hijinks of shopping with a toddler. I cracked up hysterically when there was a scene of Becky trying to get her daughter to let go of a mannequin she dubbed, \\"Dollie.\\" Trust me, as someone who regularly shops with a near two-year-old, I understand. My own daughter has figured out that things in the shopping cart get bought and brought home. She regularly tosses things into my cart, and sometimes other people's carts! She is also fascinated with my credit cards. I even made her a wallet with my old store savings cards to play with because she loves to take everything out of my wallet! So yes, I laughed hysterically when Becky tries to defend her shopping habits and Minnie pipes up \\"Visa?\\"<br /><br />It's fiction, it's meant to be light-hearted. I'm glad Sophie Kinsella is back to the Shopaholic series, because I couldn't make it through Twenties Girl. And for those who can't understand why Luke is still with Becky after all the hijinks, the answer is right there when they interview at a school for Minnie. Her heart is always in the right place. Becky's white lies have a tendency to grow out of proportion, but that's the comedy shtick Kinsella has always used, and it makes me laugh loudly to my husband's dismay (he was reading a stuffy fantasy series next to me on the couch and kept asking me to \\"Keep it down.\\")<br /><br />If some of your favorite parts of the Shopaholic series have been \\"Aunt Ermintrude,\\" and \\"She's a red-headed b*tch, and I hate her,\\" then give Mini Shopaholic a try. You will be in stitches. And if you want a tome on great parenting, read a non-fiction by the \\"experts.\\"usband's dismay (he was reading a stuffy fantasy series next to me on the couch and kept asking me to \\"Keep it down.\\")    If some of your favorite parts of the Shopaholic series have been \\"Aunt Ermintrude,\\" and \\"She's a red-headed b*tch, and I hate her,\\" then give Mini Shopaholic a try.

B001U0HAYS|5.0|I love this movie. I own it in Blu-Ray and love watching to every few years. This movie defined conspiracy genre of movies and even new TV shows.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I have not read the graphic novel that served as the inspiration for this show. I have read about 30 pages of the comics so I am only judging the show upon the DVDs. I thoroughly enjoyed this series. I began the show not caring for the characters and by the end I was deeply engrossed in the character's lives and their outcomes. Not all of the characters affected me like the main four or so characters. The series centers around the survival of a group of people close to the Atlanta metro area. The group tries to survive the zombie apocalypse with occasional run ins with other human survivors that are also trying to survive.<br />The start of the series is fantastic with Rick Grimes, the main character, awakening in an abandoned hospital with zero survivors. The story only picks up more speed from here and continues into Atlanta and then the outskirts of Atlanta. There are only six episodes in the first season with thirteen slated for season 2 which starts in October 2011. This is a hard review to write because the story is so engrossing that I do not want to give away any spoilers, but from research I do know that the TV series does not follow the graphic novel's plot closely.<br />I enjoyed the story and can not wait for the second season. I would highly recommend this show to any person looking for a new series about human survival. This show definitely made me reflect on some things because the connection between families is very deep in this show. Highly recommend this show.
B003MU9D0S|5.0|This series (starting with Sabriel) is the best YA fiction I have read to date (equal first with the Harry Potter series). I've reread the series many times and I still enjoy them even though I'm no longer young. The characters are engaging and the world fascinating and original.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Character-driven plots, and what characters !!! Be ready for a long ride you won't be able to stop after this book ends.
1439102724|5.0|This is easily the best work by Jodi Picoult to date. An achingly beautiful love story is intertwined with one of the most controversial topics facing society today. Jodi Picoult does a seamless job of tackling the issues while providing equal weight to both of the main characters embroiled in this courtroom battle.    I personally found this novel life-changing because it finally opened up the door to allowing me to be who I really am. A $23 book did what years of therapy and thousands of dollars couldn't - allowed me to embrace my true identity.    I am not saying this novel will have the same effect on everyone but I do believe it should be read by everyone. It is a story of love, tolerance, acceptance, common sense, and of blasting misconceptions and stereotypes out of the water. It presents an equal side of the story for both parties - something rare in a world where everyone wants to take one side or the other.    At the end of this novel, I cried my heart out - something I have never done before. That speaks volumes for me. I cannot emphasise strongly enough that this is a book you need to read - tears or no tears.
B0010OMXKA|5.0|I Love all kinds of Music. For me, I love Music that is REAL, From the heart and Soul of the Musician. Not just someone that is reading their vocals, or reading notes on a page. They need to give me an experience. Allow me to feel what they feel and see what they see. Andrea Bocelli gives me all that and more.

B000FCKRDI|2.0|I was heavily disappointed.<br /><br />Evangeline Jenner is desperate to get from under the thumb of her abusive family. The daughter of a gambling hall owner, after the death of her mother, her father entrusted her in the care of his in-laws thinking they would better raise her than him. Evangeline's family however uses her as a punching bag for her mother's sin of marrying a roguish man.With her father's impending death coming soon and inheritance waiting in the wings, she knows time is running out. Her family wants to marry her off to her cousin so they can kill her after the wedding and keep her money for themselves. Evie decides to proposition a man she knows is as desperate as she is: Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent.<br /><br />Sebastian, in desperate need of money agrees to Evangeline's proposition of a marriage of convenience but is caught off guard when he finds her compatible and irresistible in bed. While Evie is shocked to find that Sebastian's cold-hearted, infamous personality is really more of a façade.<br /><br />From here the story seems like it's going in a GREAT direction but it waterfalls like Niagara. It's steady and even then it just DROPS like a waterfall and it's unexpected and rough.<br /><br />There's no character development after the marriage. The sleep together twice then go visit her dying father and Sebastian takes over the runnings of his gambling club. But that's ALL there is to the story after that. The potential romance between Evie and Sebastian is lost to renovating the club, Sebastian dealing with employees and Evie not wanting to leave the club. Sure they have a few steaming kisses here and there but it's not enough to make up for the lack of plot progression and character development.<br /><br />Right at 50%, I had to literally force myself to skim like crazy just to finish the book. It was THAT disappointing. The second half of this book was sluggish, boring and so very sleepy.<br /><br />It's suppose to be the HUGE deal that stuttering wallflower Evangeline Jenner marries the notorious rake St. Vincent yet no one cares. This book takes place in a gambling hall and that makes it extra boring. It may as well have been a cardboard box house.<br /><br />The absence of well....PEOPLE made this book strangely boring for a Regency novel. After 50% I got tired of the Evie and Sebastian show with special guest star Cam the Gypsy. I was waiting for them to get out of that gaming hall and go out into society so I could see how people would react to their marriage but that NEVER happens. Even when people FINALLY come to visit they aren't enough to give this story some momentum and life.<br /><br />I'm disappointed in Ms. Kleypas for this book. So much so that I have zero desire to read any of the others in the Wallflower series. This is the second time I've been disappointed the character development of her books so I'm starting to rethink being a fan.<br /><br />Overall: I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Read it if you want but I personally would tell you to just read the reviews because every one tells enough of the story so you know what happens and to save your money.
B003L77GH4|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV, today.  It has great action, romance and will keep you guessing. I already bought the second season and it's not even done airing yet. You won't find a better price. I've looked in all the stores.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|I was amazed of the slow motion action, well executed anamation, and cinaphotography. The characters are likeable right off the start. After watching \\"Baby Doll\\" suffer the emotional and physical lose in the begining of the film you are ready for her to start kicking some butt. The soundtrack is awesome and works great with the action. The only dissapointment but only slight was the ending it's not what you'd expect. Zack Snyder is getting better each movie. I would see this movie over and over again and would recommend it to anyone who likes sci-fi action movies. Two thumbs way up!
B001GTZEZ0|5.0|This movie had no scratches and the case was in great condition too. The dvd had no problems playing and I received the dvd within 4 days after I ordered it.
B004NSULHM|5.0|Still don't know why many people rate this very low. But kinda understand if you don't like Amne.. & The Hail..
B002VPE1B6|2.0|I am sure am glad I did not rent,buy or purchase a ticket to see this  movie that everybody was so amazed by with it 3D special effects and had it not been for a freebie view from HBO I would not have cared  so I decided to record it for later view   After about 15 minutes of this I decided I had better thing to watch and do than spend another 2 hrs plus watching a bunch junk. There was no need to have people speak in another alien voice and use sub titles that went out in the 1940  and this was supposed to be a high tech hit I beg to differ. Acting such as it was  was poor and plot was jumpy and hard to follow.  2 star is all it getting and no more  so save your money and download here or wait and you will find it at a yard sale sooner or later.
B000002G7G|5.0|In 1966 something new and unheard of came out to the masses:  THE VELVET UNDERGROUND & NICO.  Every song on this super-brilliant LP is pure cream.  WHITE LIGHT/WHITE HEAT was ok too, but there was so much experimenting going on that Lou's brilliant songwriting was lost in the mix.  But their 3rd, self-titled LP shows Lou's writing only rising and rising, pure musical poetry - Doug Yule, who replaced John Cale, sings vocals on the opening track, \\"Candy Says\\".  \\"Jesus\\" is a strange song - what the hell does it mean?  Do you take it at face value and think \\"ohmygod\\", Lou's turning into a monk?  Or is it, instead, metaphorical, which would make it an apt tune for the time -after the \\"flower power\\" years of '65-'67, assassinations, bigotry, riots and the Vietnam War all coalesced to turn a once high, pie-in-the-sky ideal and twisted it into anthems of anger, isolation, anti-war protests and more self-centeredness, less universal \\"love & peace\\" - this was the epitome of disillusionment.<br />  Also, LSD was the drug that opened up consciousnesses, woke people up to what is real and helped the brain to see that crass commercialism is just as bad as the military-industrial complex, since, even back then there was synergy among behemoth corps.-from bongos to bombs.  From \\"nice\\" to Napalm, etc (for a great example of this anger/frustration, listen to \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" on King Crimson's debut, IN THE COURT OF THE CRIMSON KING (a few years ago Bad Religion came out w/a song \\"21st Century Digital Boy\\" -didn't really think much about it until I happened to hear it close-up and clearly - it's not a \\"cover\\" of the former, but, rather an \\"homage?\\" to King Crimson's tune - there's a line in the Bad Religion tune where Greg Gaffin sings a line from KC's tune:  \\"Innocents raped with Napalm fire...\\", that's when I knew what they were up to.<br />  But, I digress.  THE VELVET UNDERGROUND (Verve Records) was the last great studio LP the Velvets made as LOADED was full of pop-songs, silly goofs, etc.  It's like Lou Reed was parodying some of the banal pop crap that was eking its way out.  But Lou Reed, unlike most songwriters, can craft a beautiful song (\\"Pale Blue Eyes\\", \\"Candy Says\\", \\"Jesus\\", \\"I'll be Your Mirror\\", etc) and he can also lay down the most perfect \\"pop\\" songs, e.g., \\"Sweet Jane\\", \\"Rock & Roll\\", \\"Femme Fatale\\" and \\"After Hours\\", to name a few.<br />  After they broke up & went their separate ways, Lou Reed, it seems, had no intention of going away.  After a little rest he met David \\"genius\\" Bowie and the two of them recorded Lou's solo debut, TRANSFORMER, with Bowie getting credit as \\"Producer\\".  Besides just hanging about in the studio \\"supervising\\" (???) Bowie also shows up on the LP TRANSFORMER:  being an accomplished sax player, Bowie is the one who plays the saxophone solo at the end of the now ubiquitously famous anthem of transvestites, hustling and drug addiction, \\"Walk On the Wild Side\\".  Bowie can also be heard singing background vocals on \\"Satellite of Love\\" - towards the end of the tune, when the refrain is being sung over & over until fade-out, you hear \\"Satellite...OH, OH, OH, OH\\".  The \\"Oh-oh-oh-oh's\\", if you remember are a little high pitched (to high for Lou)but it's no woman and no unknown -it's Bowie!  For those who don't know what I mean or who want to hear it for themselves, well, dig out your copy of TRANSFORMER and listen to \\"Satellite of Love\\" at a high volume - it may take a couple listens to recognize it, but that IS Bowie, crooning along with Lou at the end.<br />  After TRANSFORMER, which was recorded in London, Lou conceived & wrote BERLIN, a \\"concept\\" album, which, initially confused & confounded critics & fans alike.  No one knew what to make of it; it lacked the crafty pop stuff that Reed had been famous for, among other feats.  No, BERLIN was a dreary, depressing dirge-like album that revolved around screwed-up relationships and co-dependency (redundant?)  So, at 1st BERLIN didn't do very well, commercially and even many long-time fans were bewildered, threw their collective hands in the air, shrugged their shoulders and moved on to what would become 2 1970s hallmarks:  Disco and Punk, the latter being in debt to Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, Bowie, MC5 and Blue Cheer.  Disco was a result of bad decision making at record labels such as Casablanca, where the producers & engineers were doing mountains of cocaine, heroin, speed and the good old classics, Nembutal, Seconal (reds) and Tuinol (found in Elvis's bathroom medicine chest after he died).  Don't forget Quaaludes and Sopors, heavy-duty sedative-hypnotics.<br />  But times change and so do tastes & understanding:  BERLIN is now considered, by most Lou fans, as one of his best works.  \\"Oh Jim\\" -into \\"Sad Song\\" are my faves on BERLIN.  But the best versions of those two cuts can be found on LOU REED LIVE (not ROCK 'N' ROLL ANIMAL) - the live \\"Oh Jim\\" is about 10 minutes long, as opposed to the LP version, which clocks in at around five 1/2 minutes.<br />  After that, heroin addiction and other demons in his life started to impact his music.  Of course, you could blame it on the times, ROCK 'N' ROLL HEART, GROWING UP IN PUBLIC, etc, were mediocre at best.  It just sounded like Lou was tired of the self-one-ups-manship of putting out better, fresher stuff every couple years, so, probably to fulfill contractual obligations, he just went through the motions and cranked out these quite introspective, but in the end, just not the same.  One exception to this was the 1978 release, STREET HASSLE, which is one of the most underrated LPs of all time; the vinyl LP's been out of print for a long time, but with CDs now, it's been re-released for you big fans.  The title cut even features a short, spoken-word lyric sung by Bruce Springsteen!  It's not sung, but you can hear \\"The Boss\\" mumbling the words over a cool bass jam near the end of the song.<br />Unfortunately, it wouldn't be until 1989 that Lou would put out one of his best efforts yet:  NEW YORK.  This was a concept album too - in fact, in the liner notes, Lou writes \\"this is meant to be played & listened to all the way through-at one sitting...\\" and indeed, it's true and the album is magic.<br />  But back to the VU's third LP - a timeless, classic that still sounds great today.  If you haven't heard it, I'd strongly suggest you go out & find it, it'll be worth your time!<br />  Happy trails,<br />  KMANTHIEcommercially and even many long-time fans were bewildered, threw their collective hands in the air, shrugged their shoulders and moved on to what would become 2 1970s hallmarks:  Disco and Punk, the latter being in debt to Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, Bowie, MC5 and Blue Cheer.

One exception to this was the 1978 release, STREET HASSLE, which is one of the most underrated LPs of all time; the vinyl LP's been out of print for a long time, but with CDs now, it's been re-released for you big fans.  The title cut even features a short, spoken-word lyric sung by Bruce Springsteen!  It's not sung, but you can hear \\"The Boss\\" mumbling the words over a cool bass jam near the end of the song.  Unfortunately, it wouldn't be until 1989 that Lou would put out one of his best efforts yet:  NEW YORK.  This was a concept album too - in fact, in the liner notes, Lou writes \\"this is meant to be played & listened to all the way through-at one sitting...\\" and indeed, it's true and the album is magic.       But back to the VU's third LP - a timeless, classic that still sounds great today.  If you haven't heard it, I'd strongly suggest you go out & find it, it'll be worth your time!      Happy trails,                  KMANTHIE
0375413405|5.0|I actually purchased this book for my mom since she loves Julia Child! This book was in great condition and she loved it!
0763644765|5.0|I started reading this book to my son when he was around 13 months. I had high hopes to EC him, but I never got around to it.    Last night, after 3 months of reading this book, my 16 month old sat on the potty and had a pee.  I kid you not.  This is my second child, and while my first trained early (night trained by 22 months), I have even higher hopes for my son  BECAUSE OF THIS BOOK.  He literally sat on his potty reading THIS BOOK, pondering what he was doing and what the little baby that looks just like him was doing. It was amazing.  It's a beautiful, funny and helpful potty book for little ones!  Update: my son is now 2. He night trained at 22 months, and has been in undies since 19 months. He rarely has accidents, and is great about taking himself to the potty.  This book helped my son teach himself how to use the potty! I LOVE THIS BOOK. My son literally trained himself before 2, and I know it was greatly due to this brilliant book designed for toddlers.
B003YOZNBU|4.0|Movies these days are like the books we have access to; in numbers and genre we have never had such great access or choices before.  There is literally something out there for everyone.  When it comes to books and movies I always think of the old saying \\"One man's garbage is another man's treasure.\\"<br /><br />Now I did not purchase or rent this movie.  No, no, no... I am too cheap.  I watched this one late at night on one of the various movies channels I have access to. Actually, truth be told, I watched it twice. I will state right now that I am rather glad I did not go to a theater to see this one...the popcorn there is outrageously priced and I am not allowed to have soft drinks or candy (my wife and doctor's doing).<br /><br />Anyway, I personally rather liked this movie and like so many movies of this sort, it fit my specific needs at the time I watched it perfectly.  There are a couple of things to consider though before you watch it.  First, if you are a comic geek like I am (I am a sort of closet comic geek and dearly love my collection of vintage Black Hawk comics), then you quite well may find this movie a disappointment if you are a follower of Jonah.  As so often happens, Hollywood has taken a very nice comic series and messed around with it a bit.  Secondly, when you watch this thing you have to remember that it is pure fantasy. I personally am not all that hung up on the comic book featuring this character and do not follow it; although I must say that is the issues I have seen are quite well done and I can fully appreciate their attraction.<br /><br />Briefly we have sort of a cross between many of the early Clint Eastwood movies and The Wild, Wild West.  Throw in some mystic powers, such as the ability of Jonah to talk to the dead and a seemingly inability to be killed on Jonah's part, and you pretty well have the overall feeling of what you are dealing with.<br /><br />Simply stated, Jonah Hex is a former Confederate soldier who betrayed his unit, shot his best friend, had his family (Jonah's) burned alive in front of him by an evil Confederate Office, was left for dead, was found by the Crow Indians, brought back to life and then goes out into the world to seek revenge.  We find that the Confederate Officer who burned his family is truly an evil guy and now has access to a \\"super weapon\\" and plans to blow up Washington D.C. along with the rest of the country.  Hex is sent of a mission my President Grant to stop the evil deeds from happening.<br /><br />What I liked about the movie was that it was truly \\"gritty,\\" and it was dark!  You came away feeling and smelling the sweat and dust and the blood and the pain. Also, Jonah is truly rather ugly with half his face burned away after being branded.  Secondly, there is a very satisfactory body count.  I sort of lost track of it after about 20 minutes...but trust me...there were plenty of various neat killings.  Third, the movie is filled with many, many very satisfactory explosions, fire and mayhem.  Fourth, the young lady who plays Hex's girl friend, a prostitute, is quite stunning and extremely pleasing to the eye. I think the current term of \\"hot,\\" would apply to her. I also rather like Jonah's dog and horse.  Fifth, I love a good revenge movie and the revenge here is absolute.<br /><br />The use of the various gadgets Hex uses in reminiscent of The Wild, Wild West but stretch your credibility to the extreme.  But of course as I said, this is pure fantasy so I did not quibble about that aspect.  As to Hex's mystic powers...hey folks, this is a movie...it is not suppose to be real...just enjoy it.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you are a fan of the Hex comics, you might be disappointed.  If you are looking for a deep and meaningful plot line...you will be devastated. The plot line is truly a mess.  If you like a fantasy story with lots of dead people, a high body count, lots of things being blown up...well, like me, you will probably enjoy this one.<br /><br />I might tell you though...watch the first 15 or 20 minutes of this one.  If you like what you see, the press on...you get more of the same throughout the film.  If you do not like it...well shut it down cause it don't get no any better than what you have already seen.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarksthis one.  If you like what you see, the press on...you get more of the same throughout the film.  If you do not like it...well shut it down cause it don't get no any better than what you have already seen.

This is how the story goes: Shortly after moving, a family discovers that dark spirits have possessed their home and that their son has inexplicably fallen into a coma. Trying to escape the haunting and save their son, they move again only to discover that it was not their house that was haunted.    The cast led by Patrick Wilson (as Josh) & Rose Byrne (as Renai) is excellent.

This is an excellent supernatural horror-thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It also keeps your heart racing and mind thinking, as well. This is one of the best horror-thrillers of the year, so far. This is James Wan's & Leigh Whannell's best movie since \\"Saw\\". This is another hit from the producers of \\"Paranormal Activity\\" & \\"Saw\\".

B003UESJHY|4.0|The Fighter, as a movie, deserved all the praise it received for its excellent acting performances.  That said, I would rather focus on the DVDs themselves albeit briefly.  The video is sharp and clean with the blacks clearly passing pluge with good details in the blacks and grays.  The extras kept my interest and while there were many shots in these extras of the main real life individuals, I would have liked to have heard from the real mother and sisters as well.<br />My biggest criticism is that rather lack luster audio which made poor use of the surrounds or even the left and right front channels.  Granted,  much of this movie is dialogue driven but when a car runs over the trash can from left to right, there was very little use of the right channel.  Even the fight scenes where surrounding crowd noise should be heard from all channels, the punched up music took away from that reality 'you are at the arena' scenario.<br />Was I glad to have ordered the Fighter?  Yes, it is a great movie and its realism realms high over the majority of boxing movies.  Discounting the lack of its audio potential, still a good one for the collection.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks

B002ZG99Z4|3.0|There is absolutely nothing of redeeming social value in this raunchy 2011 fantasy comedy, but there are some absurdly funny bits here and there to make it mildly infectious at times. Directed by David Gordon Green, who started in indie films (the acclaimed \\"George Washington\\") but last helmed the stoner farce [[ASIN:B001J9KJ2U Pineapple Express]], the film relies heavily on scatological banter, lowbrow sight gags, and over-the-top CGI effects to punctuate the sophomoric screenplay by star Danny McBride and Ben Best. McBride stars as Prince Thadeous, the cowardly brother of the heroic Prince Fabious, who is about to marry the wide-eyed virgin Belladonna when lo and behold, the villainous wizard Leezar kidnaps her and traps her in a tower like Rapunzel.<br /><br />Of course, that's the cue for Fabious to take Thadeous and his manservant Courtney to search for her with the aid of a band of knights who soon betray him. Although this is a medieval story with the appropriate sets and costumes, not much of the script is played to period. For the most part, the movie feels like a tribute to the likes of Mel Brooks, Cheech & Chong, and [[ASIN:B00005O3VC Monty Python and the Holy Grail]], with the garrulous McBride conveying his character's oversized bravado with tongue firmly in cheek. Meanwhile, James Franco plays Fabious with his slightly askew, surfer-dude manner intact, while Zooey Deschanel plays Belladonna with only a modicum of her usually ironic delivery. As Leezar, Justin Theroux has a field day with the wizard's grandiose manner and lascivious intensity.<br /><br />Rasmus Hardiker manages to give dimension to the seemingly enfeebled Courtney who inexplicably remains devoted to Thadeous despite the constant humiliation he experiences. Midway through the film enters Natalie Portman as Isabel, a merciless, Xena-like warrior who doesn't suffer fools gladly. Playing the polar opposite of her Oscar-winning role in [[ASIN:B0041KKYEM Black Swan]], she is convincing in her predictably cardboard role as a fiery avenger, whether thwacking the heads of a hydra in a Thunderdome-type arena or beating Thadeous up without breaking a sweat. Even with all the high-octane scares and thrills, the creators never forget to surrender to their more puerile instincts like the minotaur's legacy around Thadeous's neck. And yes, I laughed every time I saw it.dboard role as a fiery avenger, whether thwacking the heads of a hydra in a Thunderdome-type arena or beating Thadeous up without breaking a sweat.

B0000640VO|5.0|Watched \\"Le fabuleux destin d'Am&eacute;lie Poulain\\" (in America A.K.A. Am&eacute;lie) probably 2-3 times duaring the last 10 years. I like it more and more as I grow older. Incidentally, this was the biggest worldwide success of French cinema history. It's not a movie about falling in love, a \\"do-good\\" woman meeting her match, romancing in Paris, etc. It is a story about a woman learning how to seize the day and start to live, how to fight her own cowardice. In a way, it's as close to a feminine \\"western\\" in the Parisian Bistro settings as you can get. Yes, it's not easy to admit it, but I love it.

And the other &#34;stock&#34; characters Billy Bob Thorton as the drug using, dirty cop & Carla Giano as his too tough to be believable partner, don't make the movie any better. The best character in this film? The black Chevy Chevelle Dwayne drives around in killing people--the car Rocks!

This being so, I myself always strive to have a conscience without offense toward God and men.\\" -- Acts 24:15-16 (NKJV)<br /><br />What if no one followed their consciences? That's the troubling portrait that Michael Connelly brilliantly displays in this courtroom drama featuring Mickey Haller, the Lincoln Lawyer. We are used to a world in which lawyers know no limits in their lust for winning. What if everyone was like that? And how would it feel to be someone like that?<br /><br />Those are just some of the many interesting themes and questions that The Fifth Witness exposes.<br /><br />As the book opens, Mickey Haller has fallen on hard times, scrounging foreclosure defense cases from people who can't make their mortgage payments. He's not scamming the clients . . . because there are irregularities in the paperwork associated with the foreclosures. At best, his clients will stay in their homes a little longer as owners, before being ousted or having to becoming a renter of their former property. The arrest of one of his most outspoken clients, anti-foreclosure activist Lisa Trammel, brings Mickey back to doing what he does best -- criminal defense.<br /><br />Most of the book is taken up with Mickey's investigation, preparation for trial, conducting the trial, and dealing with the aftermath. If you don't like legal strategies and ups and downs, this may get a little tedious for you. As an attorney, I was impressed by how simply and how well the logic behind the legal moves is explained. In the background, Mickey is a lonely man . . . wishing he could remarry his prosecutor ex-wife, Maggie McPherson (\\"Maggie McFierce\\"), and become a full-time dad again for his teenage daughter, Hayley.<br /><br />While the case proceeds, Mr. Connelly also builds up an impressive indictment of banks, mortgage processors, police, prosecutors, defense lawyers, preening judges, Hollywood deal makers, unscrupulous businesspeople, and those who look out for number one in all circumstances. Some of the characters even start to dislike themselves.<br /><br />The book is very well written, spare in ways that keep the story moving . . . but with lots of unexpected plot twists to make things interesting at just the right times. I particularly liked the stream-of-consciousness parts of Mickey Haller's narration.<br /><br />To me, The Fifth Witness is a breakthrough book for the Lincoln Lawyer series and for Michael Connelly. I'm looking forward to future books in this series!<br /><br />Bravo, Mr. Connelly.<br /><br />As many people have noted, once again a major publisher has charged too much for the Kindle version. If you feel strongly about that, borrow a copy of the book at the library.d deal makers, unscrupulous businesspeople, and those who look out for number one in all circumstances.

B000VWPX3G|5.0|There were a few Hip-Hop Albums in my youth that took me by storm. One was \\"Peoples Instinctive Travels...\\" another was \\"Illmatic\\" yet another was \\"Fear of a Black Planet\\"<br />\\"Liquid Swords\\", was the last great Hip-Hop album of the nineties. GZA (The Genius) second studio album but best described as a \\"compilation\\" album that starred GZA with production duties handled by RZA (Prince Rakeem) and the 4th disciple. Pretty much all of the WU clan is represented here including Inspectah Deck, Method Man, Ghost Face Killa, Masta Killa, ODB,U-God, and Killa Priest. This album was unlike any of the other albums that are permanently etched in my memory. Illmatic was elegant. Peoples was Positive. Fear was paranoid. Liquid was deep, cold and dark like a pit.  Once you inserted the disc or tape into your stereo there was no escape until the last song was played. Its best described as a graphic novel that you listen to. No dance track to be had here just thought provoking lyrics and hypnotic trance like beats. The songs range from egomaniacal and angry to icy and sparse. No song is meant stand out here although I do have my favorites. \\"Gold\\" talks about a drug dealer's frantic almost mindless pursuit of wealth by any means. In \\"Cold World\\" Inspectah Deck and GZA both paint a vivid picture of the nightmarish chaos of a crime riddled neighborhood. The trouncing pummeling beats, the deliberately out of tune singing it matches the hopelessness and desperation of life in the streets.<br />  Method Mans overwhelming lyrical charisma anchors \\"Shadow boxing\\" In the bonus track \\"B.I.B.L.E\\" Killa Priest explains his spiritual and intellectual awakening.  \\"Liquid Swords\\" is the most personal of all the WU efforts. It tells us about the belly of the beast from which they are spawned.  The Imprecise Synthesizer driven \\"Killa Hills 10304\\" is where GZA reaches his lyrical Apex.<br />16 years old and still one of the greatest most innovative Albums ever produced.

B000BB14YY|5.0|Some will find Kurosawa's use of color (as he did in his later films) to be overly rich, and the acting in RAN especially to be a bit 'over the top', but understood in it's own terms and in the period it was made, the basis for this is Japanese \\"No Theater\\" where the characters are indeed somewhat of exaggerations, but here it is toned down for western viewers (as are many of Kurosawa's films), and Yes, the colors are overly rich, but then so were American films and movies with the actual physical film used back then. BUT, and this is a HUGE But, RAN is expansive filmaking on a scale never to be seen again! No CGI (computer generated) effects! This is film making at it's most courageous! Kurosawa was a realist! I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone by speaking of the scenes here, just suffice it to say that it makes the likes of C.B. DeMille's epic \\"Ben Hur\\" kind of pale in comparison! Kurosawa brought to movie making ABSOLUTE dedication to the end result, the film itself; All, including expenditure, was subservient to the finished product. We, sadly, live in an era in America where film making has become 'movie-making'- a set time frame, hamstrung by a million protocols and union rules (which is unfortunate as unions were badly needed in the industry in the past, and maybe now as well!), in Japan under Kurosawa it was Vastly Different. Ran is an Epic; maybe The Epic of all time, Kurosawa took so many chances here that we will never see the like again!

B001EC3JME|5.0|My original review for this holster wasn't very good, but I'm rewriting this for a number of reasons.  I carry a flashlight every day, and it's not a cheap flashlight because I depend on it.  The holster that came with my flashlight wore out quickly, and I replaced it once with another from the same manufacturer, which wore out just as quickly as the first.  This is despite my telling the manufacturer that they needed to improve on their design.<br /><br />I bought this Nite Ize holster because it sounded like a great design concept, and was an affordable price.  But when I first got it I didn't think it could possibly work or hold my expensive flashlight securely.<br /><br />I was wrong on all accounts.  I've been using it for over a year now and it holds just as tightly now as it did when I first started using it.  It wears well, fits even a very wide belt, and stay in place well.  This holster holds the flashlight tightly, yet is easy to access, and the swivel feature has come in handy too many times to count.  Even though my flashlight is a AA design, which is more slim than most CR123 type flashlights, I have no problems with it moving or sliding in this holster, even when rolling around on the ground or working on cars.<br /><br />I'm not easy to impress, but this holster has made quite an impression on me, and I plan on buying several more.  Great job Nite Ize!
0316069353|2.0|Normally I'm a big fan of Connelly, but in this story many important aspects of the plot are implausible and unexplained.    For instance: (Beyond here lie spoilers)  - Haller is beaten up by 2 thugs.  We go back and forth wondering who hired them.  Ultimately we find out who hired them but the motive is not explained in a way that makes it plausible.  - The novel exploits the recent foreclosure crisis. Connelly (like so many commentators) doesn't not understand enough economics to do anything but vilify banks and foreclosure agencies.  Haller discovers that a foreclosure agency fraudulently transfers the defendant's mortgage from one bank to another. What is the motive for the transfer? Why the fraudulent transfer?  If a mortgage holder is in default and deserves to be foreclosed, why does it matter which bank holds the mortgage?  Nobody says.  Weak!
0385341008|5.0|THE GUERNSEY LITERARY AND POTATO PEEL PIE SOCIETY - for the purpose of this review, let's shorten it to GLPPPS - is a perfectly lovely read.<br /><br />It's January 1946. England and writer Juliet Ashton, a weekly contributor of a column to The Spectator magazine under the pen name Izzy Bickerstaff, are emerging from the rubble and dreariness of the war's home front. To stay busy, Juliet is sent out on a promotional tour of her book - a compilation of her wartime columns - by her publisher and close friend, Sidney Stark of Stephens & Stark Ltd. Even so, Juliet, at age 33, lacks direction to her life.<br /><br />One day, Juliet receives a letter from a Dawsey Adams, a resident of the British Channel Island of Guernsey, who found her name and address inscribed on a second-hand book that had come into his possession. Through this initial communication, Juliet is introduced to the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, a readers' club brashly conceived and founded during a dodgy moment during the German occupation of the island during World War Two.<br /><br />First off, let me say that, in the literary fiction that spans the continuum between Shameless Chic Lit and High-Octane Testosterone Fuel, GLPPPS falls somewhere slightly off the midline and closer to the former extreme. But, the Real Man that is willing to have his feminine side touched should enjoy this book immensely. It is, after all, the Age of the Sensitive Twenty-First Century Male.

B004H2ZFPW|5.0|Huge improvement over her last album.  I've been a fan since her first album, introduced to her music by my children, and I was disappointed with her last release.  I listen to a variety of music types, mostly rock and pop, and I feel she has matured nicely over time and it feels like this album is more \\"her\\" than the last.  Some of this is very \\"poppy\\", some ballads, some accoustic and even a good Joan Jett cover.  Very pleased with this purchase.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|This has to be my favorite album of 2011 (so far). To me, her sound is very retro, which makes it that much more appealing.  Certainly cannot wait for more.
B0018QPPXW|4.0|A delightful fantasy movie which brought Tom Cruise into the limelight as an upcoming mega-star.  I liked the uptight protagonist and his goofy buddies, and of course the slut, Tom's love interest. The parents were hysterical and overprotective, with the ultra-perfect suburban home with the dad's dream car. This had all the makings of a great comedy, and the movie delivers for way-out entertainment.  The movie proves that there are many ways of getting into Princeton with an average academic performance.  The ladies will all remember Tom's exciting rock-and-roll performance in his briefs.  A good movie!

B001ED7C58|5.0|Great music on this soundtrack CD.  Whether you liked the movie and books or not - the music chosen on this CD is memorable and moody.  It is very different than most other CDs out on the market and worth listening to over and over!  Each song is different yet flows nicely from the previous song. Great CD for background party music or long drive in the car.  The music is slightly alternatvie wtihout being inaccessible. Worth buying!
B004J4WQ46|5.0|i been sort of waiting for this album for a long time. \\"the strokes\\" are one my favorite bands. theirs some really great songs on the album  and couple they could have left off. I'm sort of thinking this is the last one for this band. sad but i think all those great bands of 2000's are slowly fading away like all great music does. but definitely a classic album from a great band. a sure buy for any strokes fan but if your just learning about the band i get one of their earlier albums.
1574216988|5.0|This book does assume that you already know the basics of Zentangle; and after that - wow! While I have a book that says \\"shading is nice to add\\", this book gives you instructions on *how* to shade. Ditto with many techniques. For inspiration alone this book is well worth the price.
0618680004|5.0|An interesting point has been brought up by some theologians and secular philosophers about this book: It doesn't use the best arguments against God's existence. Not that the arguments in here aren't good, but they aren't always the best. I am not a philosopher (except in an amateur sense), so I imagine they could give a pretty good run down of why these explanations aren't the best.     The \\"Where did God come from?/Who designed the designer?\\" argument:    If one is attempting to explain the origins of the universe, then claiming it comes from some un-caused cause is rather arbitrary, one could just as easily claim the universe itself was un-caused and therefore save a step (Occam's Razor) and arrive at the same conclusion (and no, the Kalam Cosmological Argument doesn't succeed is showing the universe had a cause).   William Lane Craig has criticized this argument by saying (paraphrase) \\"If this is your approach to explanation, then you will get an infinite regress, and never come to any answer, thereby destroying science\\" which isn't entirely true. Dawkins points out on pg 188, \\"The whole problem we started out with was the problem of explaining statistical improbability.\\" By positing natural selection as a \\"consciousness raiser,\\" he has shown that there are processes that can account for such improbability. A process doesn't need to be explained separately from its definition. One can ask \\"Where did the designer come from?\\" and have to resort to some other, external explanation or some kind of metaphysical jargon about being a \\"necessary being.\\" But to ask \\"Where did the process come from?\\" one need only point out that since it's a process, it is simply the result of various things interacting. A process isn't a \\"thing\\" that needs to be explained separately from what it does. Dawkins uses evolution as an example of the explanatory power of such processes in biology, and points out that there are probably similar explanations in other scientific fields, even if they haven't been discovered yet. This is why positing an intelligent designer is problematic.  Additionally, an infinite regress is not a problem in science. Since science is about discovering mysteries and explaining things, an infinite regress would allow science to go on forever. What WOULD destroy science is to say \\"THIS is the ONLY explanation, end of discussion.\\"      Additionally, his case against the ontological argument has been criticized by some, who have (rightly) pointed out that it has puzzled philosophers for centuries, and that it's rather patronizing of Dawkins to be so cavalier with it. I don't think this is a problem myself, as I also find it to be absurd.   Dawkins points out on pg. 107, \\"My own feeling, to the contrary, would have been an automatic suspicion of any line of reasoning that reached such a significant conclusion without feeding in a single piece of data from the real world. Perhaps that indicates no mare than that I am a scientist rather than a philosopher.\\" None of the criticisms against this book that I have read have addressed this statement, which is a neat summery of why philosophy itself often gets a bad rap: it is often disconnected from the real world; science has done more to aid the human condition in the last 400 or so years than 2000+ years of philosophy has.        Dawkins blows the teleological (fine-tuning) argument clean out of the water, and demolishes the argument from personal experience. Both are popular arguments used for the existence of any deity.    This book has done more for the case of atheism and getting people to realize we don't have to sit by and deal with theocratic encroachment on our lives then almost all the \\"proper\\" atheistic philosophy has done. People aren't likely to go out and read \\"The Impossibility of God\\" as summer reading, much less understand much of it without some formal philosophical training. But \\"The God Delusion,\\" while not perfect, is accessible and enjoyable.   To make an analogy:Napoleon was an incredible general, but even he needed an army to get anything done. The best atheist arguments in philosophy are like Napoleon sulking in his room. Dawkins provides the army, the accessibility, for these arguments to be known in the world.
B001UV4XHY|2.0|I  have watched all the Potter films and I just finished watching Hallows Part 1.  I know the plot was darker in tone than the others but why make the film so hard to see.

B00005MJ13|5.0|I have other recordings of the Dvorak and the Smetana, but I did not have the Liszt in my library.  I have heard wonderful things about Maestro Fricsay, but again had nothing in my library, so I took a flyer on this CD.  This has quickly become one of my favorite recordings.  All three pieces are worthy by themselves, but as a collection, they are absolutely stunning.  Despite its age, the recordings are very clean, with no evidence of compression or limited audio range.  The DG engineers did a great job recording and mixing the performance.  The sound is easily on par with a recording done in the past ten years, not one done 50 years ago.    But the wonder for me are the interpretations of Maestro Fricsay.  All of the performances sound energetic and fresh, and develop the music in a very engaging manner.  For me, these performances are the best I have ever heard of each of these pieces, and I enjoy listening to them repeatedly.  This recording is easily one of the very best I have ever heard.    It is a real tragedy the Fricsay died so young, thus leaving such a limited legacy.  If you hear this recording you will understand that what a great artist he was.
1934030198|5.0|On reading this book I have to say that it is one of the most no-nonsense, well referenced training books that I have read.  Jo Friel knows his subject inside out and backs up his training philosophies with hard data. There isn't the usual waffle about \\"Bill the banker and how he became motivated to enter the ironman\\" just excellent training advice and methods.  I'd highly recommend this book to anyone undertaking their first triathlon or for the experienced athlete trying to refine their training regime.

B002YV7P10|5.0|I don't know why this title was never released in a UK or American edition. I'm afraid I can't tell you whether this edition is in English or Spanish or whether it is good quality or not. I have the Dutch edition (which you can find [[ASIN:B0018UZCVS here]]. Both are Region 2 so they won't play in a regular DVD player.<br /><br />This film is a BBC Docudrama produced in 2006 and starring Alexander Siddig (Dr. Bashir from Star Trek: DS9) as Hannibal, and no one else I know except for Ben Cross (Sarek, also from Star Trek). I have never understood the use of docudramas. If you want to make a documentary, make a documentary; if you want to make a period piece, make a period piece. Combining the two does not work. It is not as accurate as a documentary or as exciting as a drama. But the BBC was quite fond of churning them out in the middle of the decade. Within a few years they threw out at least than three of them set at least partially in ancient times: [[ASIN:B0022SFCO2 Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire]], Heroes & Villains (Released in the US as [[ASIN:B001O2UTT0 Warriors]]. Was the original name too confusing?), and this one. Of them all I think that this one is the most coherent. Instead of a bunch of shorter episodes dealing with different people, it spends the whole time looking at the Carthaginian general Hannibal. No, not that Hannibal. This one doesn't eat people (that we know of). Hannibal was the man who almost took down Rome itself. He crossed the Alps and brought the fight to them culminating in one of the most decisive battles the world has ever seen. Yet the Romans survived and lived to fight another day.<br /><br />So, how well does it do? Historically it gets a few things wrong and compresses some events to make them fit into an hour and a half program but is very accurate on the whole. Entertainment-wise it is also very good. Some of the dialogue is clunky and phony but it doesn't distract from the story too much. The effects seem about normal for a docudrama at first. In most scenes you can tell that there are only a few dozen men playing soldiers. The battle of Ticinus features about two dozen men on each side wailing at each other with swords. That's about what I expected from the production, and it's dull. Then it reaches Cannae and everything changes. Cannae is Hannibal's big battle, the one that would define his career. He fought a Roman army that outnumbered him and managed to not only defeat it, but obliterate it killing about 50,000 men in the course of a few hours. And this film captures it just right. I really don't know how they did it. It must be CGI because they could never have afforded that many extras, but it doesn't look like any CGI work I've ever seen. It details exactly what tactics were used to win the battle and illustrates them perfectly. I don't think I've seen a better (or more accurate) battle on-screen before, with the possible exception of Oliver Stone's [[ASIN:B000MGB6NM Alexander]]. The battle of Zama is similarly well done with some believable elephant charges. Both of them are too short unfortunately, but that's a television budget for you. They could not have done better with what they had. A superb job.<br /><br />Apart from the battles, the story's quite good since it follows the facts pretty well and the facts are pretty cool. The first part (45 minutes) covers Hannibal crossing the Alps and kinda rushes through the battles of Trebia and Trasimene (Trasimene in particular is just a voiceover with stills of dead Romans). The second half contains both of the main battles and is infinitely the better for it. Hannibal's character is portrayed somewhat inconsistently. While he starts off as a living embodiment of vengeance after Cannae he starts talking about how too much blood has been spilled and becomes a bit of a whiner. While this isn't an utterly invalid view I don't think that they handled it too well. The turnabout is too sudden and it is unconvincing to hear him talk about not taking Rome because they're not barbarians. It's not really an ancient attitude and it seems to be thrown in there to make him more sympathetic.<br /><br />The casting is a bit of a problem. Siddig is great as Hannibal who comes across as both fierce and brilliant, but most of the supporting cast can't keep up. I guess there aren't many British Arabic actors to choose from which is why Hannibal's brothers look nothing alike. Then again, the Roman cast isn't much better. Cross does fine as Fabius, but the guy playing Scipio is far too old for the part. He's at least in his mid-30s and it seems strange to hear people talking about how young he is to have achieved what he did. It makes sense age-wise by Zama, but that only gives him ten minutes or so at the proper age. Hannibal should be younger too of course, but his age wasn't so significant as Scipio's since Rome had to bend all their laws to give Scipio the command. And it's also strange that a man who's most defining characteristic in his sculptures is his baldness is played by a man with far too much hair for a Roman. Most odd. But I'm nitpicking now. On the whole the film is good, the story is good, the lead performances are good, and the battles are great. The narration is only occasionally present and while it's annoying it shouldn't get in the way of enjoying the film. So check it out if you get the chance, and hopefully they'll release it in Region 1 someday.Rome because they're not barbarians.

To prove his thesis he studied half an hour a day plus a few daily five-minute sessions and followed advice from a trainer. A year later, Foel entered the US Memory Championship and to his surprise, won first place.<br /><br />  An investigative reporter, Foel explores the history of centuries of memorization. Memorizing was formerly an important part of being well educated.<br />Foel discusses scientific research on brain functions and memory. He explains that the more we know (by memorizing), the more creative we can be because we have more ideas to work with and combine.<br /><br />The author interviewed people with outstanding or unusual memories, such as Kim Peek, the subject of the movie \\"Rain Man\\". Foel met several times with Daniel Tammet, writer of a best seller, Born on a Blue Monday. Tammet is a possible Aspergers Syndrome sufferer, but more likely a self-trained memory expert. Foel became acquainted with winners of British, International and US Memory competitions and studied their techniques.<br /><br />The book is intriguing, interesting and fun to read because Foel includes his and other people's stories in addition to history and science.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|This is a well-made, well-researched movie about the 2008 financial meltdown, the one from which the world is still struggling to recover.  Struggling, that is, unless you happen to work for a Wall Street financial institution or for any of their agents in government or academia.  As this film makes miserably clear, the people responsible for this economic disaster lost nothing more than perhaps a few hours sleep dreaming up lies to tell the public and government investigators.  They otherwise continue to reap million dollar salaries in the finance sector, and to take advantage of government appointments to enable and support the thievery of their friends and former colleagues.  This is perhaps the most depressing movie I've watched in quite a while for demonstrating that no matter who moves into the White House or Congress, at then end of the day money talks and values walk.  Many thanks to director/producer Charles Ferguson for taking on these criminals and for calling out their lies.  The world needs more brave men and women like you, Mr Ferguson.<br /><br />#
B004EQAVHI|5.0|As a 35 year-old-male with stage-4 cancer, I was easily able to relate to the three main characters in this film. The thing that I got from the movie was that it was not the issue of death itself that affected the characters, it was the feeling that there was no time to make up for past mistakes. A great feeling of guilt and regret along with the knowledge that the friendship would soon be over gave the film an even more emotional element not seen in other films. I cannot think of any other movie that has had the emotional effect on me that this one has. The day I received the movie, I watched it twice and promptly put the DVD back into the mailbox so I would not watch it again. Later that night while I was lying in my bed, I started thinking about the movie. Then I started to cry, something I had not done in a very long time. No movie had ever given me the reaction that this one did. \\"Never Let Me Go\\" is a movie I would recommend to everyone.

B004K4IZ54|5.0|I've just returned from my 3rd theatrical viewing (IMAX Omni) of this film. It's a completely indescribable experience, except that I can say it appeals to my sense of aesthetics both aurally and visually in just about every way I could imagine. The only other film I can think of that even came close was The Island.<br /><br />This, to me, is exactly how the prequel Star Wars experience should have been. Profoundly ironic that I've always joked about Lucas' poorly conceived trilogy feeling like something concocted by Disney. A thousand apologies to Disney for those thoughts and remarks in light of what they have accomplished here. In fact, to borrow a quote, I would hope Lucas feels he just \\"got dunked on\\" in a big way. There are plenty of Star Wars undertones throughout, from the ominous \\"emperor\\" with his right hand \\"sith\\" assassin (who dual-wields two red discs), to Sam's \\"Obi-Wan Kenobi\\"-like father and the lovely \\"princess\\" he protects, to the activation effects of the combat discs, right up to Sam's mistaking the light cycle stick for a lightsaber. Haha, that's like the icing on the cake when he does that and then Jarvis gives him that condescending look, as if to say \\"no, it's not THAT\\". And it definitely isn't THAT, being far greater than anything Lucas could come up with.<br /><br />I'm not sure how the critic reviews for this film could be a dead 50% split between positive/negative, but my guess is that those I would view as the \\"dumb majority\\" just do not have a proper appreciation for light, sound, and great story-telling.<br /><br />Speaking of light and sound, this is the closest approximation of a \\"feely\\" that I've ever come across. (If you don't understand that term, read Adolf Huxley). When the first Recognizer appeared on screen, the legs of my pants began literally to vibrate with the sonic intensity of it's propulsion drive as it landed. Never before have I actually felt the presence of something that was on a screen. There are many such intense scenes in this movie, to such a degree that it feels quite like a ride. The only way I would ever think of watching this film at home would be at similarly loud volume and with a minimum of 7.1 surround sound. High-quality headphones might actually be the only practical way to do this movie justice without an elaborate and expensive sound system, not to mention the risk of annoying the neighbors!<br /><br />Blu-ray... I'm not a fan, but this single movie leads me to greatly reconsider adding 3D Blu-ray to my entertainment setup. Perhaps one day, once 3D technology gets itself some standards established.<br /><br />This is not a review of the physical product, since 1) I don't yet own it, and 2) nor do I have a 3D Blu-ray disc player. However, for a modern film release you shouldn't need that kind of reassurance. If you love Tron to even a percentage of the degree that I do, simply get it. I feel slightly sorry for anyone who missed seeing it in theatres -- the best possible way by far to see this film.

B003AO1SVS|4.0|The Black Keys are the latest incarnation of garage-band boys to discover the gritty blues. \\"Brothers\\" is their best to date, having distilled their influences down to basics, at the same time not jettisoning the hipster production stlye of Danger Mouse and his ilk. The atmosphereic wooshes that swirl underneath the best songs here (especailly \\"Too Afraid To Love You\\") eliminate mone of the primal yearning from the songs, and pull them into a more modern sound. Even the update of Jerry Butler's \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" maintains a reverence for the original; other than being recorded in this century, there's not much difference between the way the two songs feel.<br /><br />Which is one of the many reasons I enjoy \\"Brothers.\\" The big echoing drums, the fuzzy guitars, the less than perfect singing (there's no auto-tune on this album) make it more of a feel album than a technical one. When something chugs like \\"Sinister Kid\\" or reaches to the falsetto heavens like \\"Everlasting Light,\\"  you can tell that Patrick Carney and Dan Auerbach are trying more to make the album sound right more than having one more go at that perfect take. Or that they feel no shame in taking a Gary Glitter drum stomp and attatching it to \\"Howlin' For You.\\" \\"Brothers\\" takes to the same mold that Jack White seems to have gone for with Dead Weather in that anything worth using is good in service to the song.<br /><br />Fans of slicked up blues or even the uber-purists will likely not like this, as the music is raw and blunt, without much thought for replicating tradition in a narrow sense. \\"Brothers\\" rumbles along its own stream, engrossing everything in the water like so much swamp moss.
B00062RCBW|5.0|I'm a little confused about the negative complaints. The set I received are excellent in both video & audio quality. Also the packaging is very nice (each year in a separate fold-out book that looks good on a shelf). I got the \\"silver\\" set (not the newest). In particular, the on-screen menus are very \\"Trekkie\\". What can I say: I love it!  The Next Generation stories are great (the science is plausible & the actors do a great job, unlike the newer \\"Enterprise\\" series).     It's great to go to a place where rationality & morality rule. Nice to get away from the \\"age of stupidity & moral cowardice\\" we currently reside in (e.g. \\"How dare you speak the truth! That's not \\"politically correct\\".) Enjoy!
0312330871|3.0|Agatha Christie's 1939 story idea captures the imagination. Ten strangers who each, in his or her own way, have gotten away with murder gather by invitation at an isolated mansion. Then their unknown host systematically and mockingly murders them one by one. The idea was adapted into a film in 1945, 1965, 1974, and 1989, as well as a TV adaption in 1959 and a Russian production (often credited as the truest to the book, though hard to get a good copy of that is not too dark and muffled).  Variants of the plot are perennials in movies and TV, appearing, for example, in Harry O, Quincy, and Remington Steele. As someone who has read all of Christie's work and admires it as running the gamut from diverting to entertaining to inspiring, I had high expectations. Unfortunately, neither Christie nor the filmmakers succeeded in bringing this brilliant idea to life in a truly fulfilling story.  Occasionally, a mystery plot can be so ingenious and powerful that it can be a satisfying story in itself. Most often, the best that is achieved by plot alone is an amusing but arid puzzle mystery. For the depth and richness to engage, a novel usually needs to develop to some meaningful degree the characters, their backgrounds, their interaction, their dialogue, the setting, the tone, and any larger themes.<br /><br />The premise of Christie's book is fascinating. As to plot, the book is clever in conception and careful in execution. Compared to the films, the book's assortment of past crimes and depictions of the characters' attitudes toward them are more varied, subtle, and interesting. The order of the crimes has some meaning.  The book does the best job of presenting the characters in ways in which the reader could actually see them as the murderous host. It is the least sentimental, treating all of them vaguely and suspiciously. This is not necessarily enough to make them convincing killers, but at least it maintains more of a sense of menace, suspense, and purpose than the film versions. The book does the best job of explaining why and how the host carried out the scheme.<br /><br />Yet, even the plot has definite shortcomings. Once the imaginative premise is established, the story becomes thin and formulaic. There is little plot or character development. The characters in the book engage in less deductive reasoning and survival techniques than in the 1945 film. The only real plot twist creates a major logical problem, which the book tries to overcome by implausibly suggesting that the ploy would either trick or \\"rattle\\" the murderer. The guests' murders are designed to follow the nursery rhyme, but, aside from some cosmetic frills, the poisoning, stabbing, shooting, and head-bashing that go on in the book show, in themselves, no special cunning, skill, strategic advantage, or plausibility. The killer strikes crudely without detection too effortlessly.<br /><br />The storytelling seems flat, frigid, and, at times, slow-paced. There is no lead character to care about. Characters are described largely by catch-phrases (the judge's \\"tortoise-like\\" appearance; Lombard's \\"wolfish smile\\") or hardly at all (Marston, the Rogerses). Their backgrounds and motives are sketched in summary fashion. The past crimes vary widely in originality, depth, and genuineness. Some -- especially Claythorne's and the general's -- are more subtle, interesting, and powerful than others. Some, like Blore's, Dr. Armstrong's, and Lombard's, are utterly trite, unexplored, and ineffective.<br /><br />However, the book's and films' worst failing is that they have nothing serious to say about the powerful themes that are at the very heart of the story. The story is inherently an observation of human nature in a desperate situation. How do the characters behave? How do they try to reason? How do they try to survive? Also by its very nature -- as the book's last pages acknowledge -- this story is a morality play. How is each of the characters a \\"criminal\\"? How is each \\"beyondthe law\\"? Does each get \\"justice\\"? Is justice the point, or simply a \\"lust\\" to torture and kill? Is the story about breaking the law or enforcing it, about mistakes or abuses in pursuing justice? None of this is meaningfully addressed.<br /><br />The films are worse in some respects and better in some respects than the book. Each is worth seeing as an attempt to bring to life a compelling but at the same time confining plot concept. Each, like the book, fails to fully realize that idea as a story.<br /><br />Briefly, the 1945 film develops the plot better in some ways than the book and is more entertaining. The cast is outstanding, except Mischa Auer. But the film presents the general and his past crime ineffectively and changes others. Its attempts to make the characters entertaining come at the expense of their plausibility as villains and of the story's seriousness. The climactic scene revealing the host's identity, means, and motives is short, sedate, and unsatisfying.<br /><br />The 1965 film is enjoyable and energetic. But it is not as tightly and richly told, nor as well-acted, as the 1945 version, despite good casting. As in 1945, attempts to make characters comical or appealing sap the suspense. The final scene has more explanation than in 1945, but remains thin and undramatic.<br /><br />The 1974 film takes a different tone than its predecessors. It captures more of a sense of fear, dread, and suspense. Yet, overall, the movie is less substantial and entertaining than the prior versions. The storytelling is so spare and unartful that it is sterile and uninvolving. Other than Stephane Audran, the outstanding cast is unable to breathe life into the characters. The final scene is less effective than before.<br /><br />Everything about the 1989 version seems low-budget, from the cast to the script to the set to the production values. The casting of the doctor is even worse than Frank Stallone as Lombard. And not until Donald Pleasance's final moments on screen does he play his character with any coherence. But Herbert Lom is excellent as the general. And it is left to this film to finally present a dramatic end scene.\\"? Is justice the point, or simply a \\"lust\\" to torture and kill?

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I know I say that this is the best album from the Foo Fighters; however, it's quite difficult to compare this album to the first two (and arguably best two albums from the Foo Fighters in 1995 and 1997 respectively). But this album kicks ass. If you like rock then you need to get this album. It's very rare that I like every track from an album, but this is one of the few that accomplishes this feat. Great album.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|This new music by Yanni is a very special mix of instrumental and some voice.  I have listened to this CD dozens of times and every time I get a new sense of what living is all about.  Every time I listen, I pick up new instruments in the recording that I didn't seem to hear before.  The music is pure Yanni.  I don't know any other musician that could mix voice and instrument together with so much feeling and mastery.  This might be one of my all time favorite albums. There are 15 songs on the CD which really gives you your money's worth of listening.  I highly recommend this album if you have good music appreciation.  There are 3 voice pieces and 12 instrumental and electronic pieces on this CD.  Such great music.  You just can't go wrong listening to Yanni's new stuff.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Denzel and crew did an excellent job in this thriller with lots of excitement.  Great entertainment and worth the price.
0307593495|3.0|This book really disappointed me.  For all these years, we were taken into Kurt Wallander's mind, through all of his health and mental issues in depth. Yet, Mankell finishes his career off in one non descriptive page.    Also, the anti American tone of the book disappointed me.  I am well aware of Mr. Mankell's left wing leanings and that is his own business but don't appreciate his perpetrating his anti American thinking on me.  He puts America in the class of the old Soviet Union and chastises the Swedish people for their pro American thinking.    As Mankell has gotten older, he mirrors Wallander in that he has become positively grumpy.  The plot of this book was not to my liking and was very contrived.      I guess it has a positive effect.  I wont miss the Wallander books as much as I thought I would.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|The dvd came in without any problems and played on my set.  Definitely I will purchase products from this seller again.
B0048EANPQ|5.0|Well, I never like Sandra Bullock but she is brilliant for this role.  I understand this movie was adopt from real life and it's great.  I'm not going to describe or critic about the story line or the film progress to the end, that's no point.  What I got from this movie is a message that I think it is beautiful.  It is the act of kindness, caring, loving.  A relationship that bound by soul.  A family who have a heart of gold.  This is not easily found in this day.  BRAVO.
B004P3A4WM|5.0|I love this movie and it nice to see it on Blu-Ray.  The price was good and it was delivered in a timely manner.
B004GHBQ7O|2.0|I love Bullet in a Bible and I'm a huge Green Day fan, so naturally I was excited when Awesome as F**k was announced. The DVD is extremely dizzying to watch. Call it art... call it whatever you want...It's not fun to watch and I do not like it. Half the time it's blurry and looks like the crappy quality clips are messily patched together causing the screen to skip around. It looks more like an MTV music video rather than a true concert experience. Honestly I think I could have recorded better clips with my phone. If you're looking to purchase a DVD to relive your concert experience, get Bullet in a Bible. Don't waste your money on Awesome as F**k.
0316069353|5.0|All things being equal, I would have have given this 4 stars instead of 5. However, seeing that so many of you have given it 1 star based only on the pricing issue I felt the need to try to counter that in some small way. For those of you who think writing a negative review based solely on the Kindle price is kosher, please read the the instructions: \\"What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?\\" You obviously knew how much it was before you bought it so get over it. Personally, I feel all ebooks are ripoffs but that's just my HO.    This book was a really good read and I never felt it lag. I'm on the fence about the \\"Lincoln Lawyer\\" abandoning his Lincoln for a bricks & morter office and what appears to be a major shift coming in Haller's career path. But OTOH it could be that Connelly felt he had taken the back seat office thing as far as he could.     I must have changed my mind a dozen times on the guilt or innocence of his client. Keeping the reader both engrossed in the story and guessing \\"did she or didn't she?\\" to my mind are the hallmarks of a really good book. This one fits the bill.
0316069353|5.0|I have read every one of Michael Connelly's books and this one is the best of his Mickey Haller books.  It is very timely in that it concerns Mickey representing people who are in danger of losing their homes in foreclosure.  One of his clients is accused of murdering an employee of the bank that is foreclosing on her.  There are the twists and turns that is a hallmark of Connelly's books.  He is a master of storytelling and the well thought out plot is terrific.  I saw that there were a large number of reviewers that graded this book as a 1 star and I thought there must be some sort of mistake.  Then I saw that a great many of the reviews were reviewing the PRICE of the book.  While I do not like the cost of the book either, I urge people thinking of purchasing the book to please not just go on the over all star rating but read some of the reviews pro and con. I would rather spend the money on a Michael Connelly book than the greatest majority of other authors.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book is one of the best books I've read. It's very well written, I could hardly put it down. I would recomend this book to anyone who loves books that make you want to keep reading. This book is a action packed book that makes yu want to keep reading.
0802714544|1.0|Great novel, lousy edition. I counted six typos on the first ten pages alone (\\"boot\\" instead of \\"booth,\\" \\"the\\" instead of \\"they,\\" etc.). Stay away from Walker & Company.
030746363X|1.0|Too complicated and not sustainable.  Healthy eating and regular exercise got me much better results.  There is no quick fix as promised in this book.
B001E75QH0|5.0|The Indiana Jones movies are all classics, they'll be watched long after most movies from this era are forgotten (most already are forgotten).  I'm not going to review the movies, that's been done 2 billion times already, but I will say I enjoy all 4, yes even 'Crystal Skull'.  The ending was as plausible as any other Indy movie, really.  Indiana Jones movies now have everything, including aliens. These movies are pure escapism, action, over the top, non-stop.  That's what makes them so watchable.      I saw this set and knew right away I had to have it.  The picture quality is top rate, especially with an upconverting DVD player, super crisp and sharp.  Enjoy.
1423113381|3.0|When I heard that Rick Riordan was putting out another adventure series like Percy Jackson, I was excited to see how he would spin the Eqyptian lore. While the idea of two POV's was a great idea it didn't necessarily work. Sadie and Carter did not seem to have very different 'voices' and I had to check which POV I was even reading at times. That being said, the spin was a unique one and with a much less extensive knowledge about Eqyptian mythology than Greek Mythology, I was happy to learn while reading. The story, while obviously original, still felt like it was recycled. You could have just plunked Percy into the Eqyptian setting and had the same story. It just didn't feel like a different story entirely. Riordan did do a great job of getting the reader hooked though and eager to see how the next book will play out, so I will definitely be reading The Throne of Fire, maybe by then Sadie and Carter will hold their own and make me forget that Riordan ever wrote Percy Jackson. I'm hopeful :)
B001EN71DG|5.0|I waited a long time to buy any Star Wars movies, and I'm glad I waited for this set, along with the 'matching' prequel set.  I saw the original Star Wars at the theater when it first came out and was blown away by the story, action and special effects.  It truly was groundbreaking.  I didn't see 'Empire' or 'Jedi' in the theaters, but watched them on VHS  when they were released.  They looked lousy on VHS and I lost some of my enthusiam for Star Wars as I felt # 5 & 6 were just ripping off and copying the original.  Remember this was in the day before sequels were accepted as 'legit' movies.       I decided to invest in the whole series when I found this box set and the pequel set at a good price.  This set has a very good digitally mastered newer version that looks great.  On my upconverting DVD player on a 32 inch 720i screen, it looks almost like a bluray hi def picture.  I mean its that good.  The bonus disk with the original theatrical release has not been remastered or cleaned up and looks it.  It is also in an extremem 2.85:1 aspect ratio and even on a wide screen set, the black bars top and bottom are huge.  But its nice to have as a bonus piece of nostalgia.      If you haven't bought Star Wars yet, this would be a good purchase, or get the Bluray version of this set.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This DVD is amazing. The entire cast is so talented. I enjoy putting it on and listening to the music while doing housework or sitting and watching it.
B0017YZIL4|5.0|This is a great album by wes montgomery! This album has a huge influence on me and the guitar playing is incredible and beautiful i love it. This is actually the first jazz guitar album i have ever bought and im so glad to have it in my collection. I love how mellow and relaxing this album is its very peaceful. I look forward to buying more of wes's albums in the future. I love the beautiful guitar playing on In your own sweet way its a beautiful piece. Also this album has paved the way for me to buy django reinhardt and charlie christian which i have never heard. Jazz music is beautiful.
0316017922|3.0|Read the Epilogue first.  This will help you \\"get it\\".  Because of his Jamaican ancestry, Gladwell is familiar with the importance of skin shade and the era in which one is born in determining achievement; lighter skinned slaves worked indoors and lived a longer happier life than dark skinned slaves--and the degree of lightness or darkness of skin mattered (i.e. white and light, olive, light brown, dark brown and black).    Gladwell theorizes that parentage and benefaction control individual success; when and where one grows up, cultural legacies and special opportunities are the real-world factors that determine extraordinary achievement; inherent talent plays less of a role than preparation.  Researchers can, says Gladwell, predict which countries are best at math, without testing students, by determining which nations place the highest emphasis on effort and hard work and do not give schoolchildren long summer vacations.  Gladwell's   citation of research is sparse at times and his interpretation of the results of the research is debatable.   According to Gladwell, researchers have found that excellence at performing a complex task requires a minimal level of 10,000 hours of practice. This amount of practice is only possible if a person is afforded an extraordinary opportunity such as was enjoyed by Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and The Beatles.  The opportunities, and the strength and presence of mind to use them-- not extraordinary talent or intelligence--determine who will be an Outlier and achieve phenomenal success; not even the most gifted can escape the limitations of their generation or place in history.    Gladwell's definition of meaningful work perplexed me until I took into account the Jamaican slaves from whom he descended. He describes work in the garment industry and in rice paddies as meaningful because of the autonomy, complexity and connection between effort and reward; compared to slavery these are indeed meaningful occupations.    What does this allmean to Gladwell?  In order to build a better world, humankind should strive to replace the patchwork of opportunities with opportunities for all. This concept, though difficult to fully implement, is not new;  Gladwell succeeds in renewing my commitment to this ideal.
B00006AW2S|5.0|This album is raw period i love it i could listen to this album over and over again. I love how the album starts with mercy mercy what a great song. The last time is a awesome song thats one of my favorite all time songs ever. I love i cant get no satisfaction i dont care how many times that song has been played its still a great song. Lets not forget play with fire that song is one of best rolling stone songs ever. Play with fire sounds so dark and i love it the vocals and the guitar and the other instruments are beautiful.
0375842209|5.0|This book was incredible. It was hopeful and heartbreaking at the same time.<br /><br />Told from the perspective of Death, the story is about a little girl named Leisel Meminger and the hardships she endures from having to leave her mother behind and losing her brother, to her life in Nazi Germany amongst \\"Heil Hitler's\\" and bomb raids. Leisel is extremely smart despite the fact that she is given few opportunities because of the times and her low income situation. Her foster parents accept her and teach her to read and she creates an intense bond with them, especially her foster father who takes a special interest in the girl. She also has an intrigung relationship with a Jewish man that the family begins hiding in their basement. He becomes her best friend, in many ways.<br /><br />This book is tense, thrilling, and you won't want to stop reading it. You're scared for the lives of everyone on Himmel street. And for the first time, I truly thought about the suffering, innocent Germans in WWII, not just the suffering of those persecuted by the Germans, but those made to follow along with Hitler's ways, and when they aren't, they're severely punished. It's a piece of history that I think is rarely considered.<br /><br />This book should be on reading lists everywhere. and I know it is classified as a Young Adult book which is kind of perplexing to me, but no matter, it is amazing and a great read for anyone of any age. It's a real eye opening book.

0545123275|5.0|I picked up this book when Ms. Stiefvater came to New Orleans for a book signing. I hadn't read Shiver yet, but planned to, \\"eventually\\". Why, oh why, did I wait so long to read this book?!?<br /><br />When Grace was a small child, she was dragged off her backyard swing by wolves and almost killed. One wolf stopped the pack from killing her, and since then Grace has felt a special bond with \\"her wolf\\". She looks forward to seeing her wolf every winter, when the pack comes to the woods behind her house.<br /><br />Sam has watched Grace ever since he kept the rest of his pack from killing her 6 years ago. He watches her from afar, thinking about her, wishing their lives weren't worlds apart.<br /><br />After a wolf attack on a fellow student, the town decides to kill the wolves. As she arrives home after trying to stop the hunters, she spies a wolf on her porch - he'd been shot. Then, suddenly, not a wolf, a boy - Sam.<br /><br />The love story between Sam and Grace is epic. You wouldn't think a story between teenagers could be, but the obstacles between them seem insurmountable. As they fight the end - Sam's eventual final change into wolf, they know that the time they have together is stolen from fate. Grace is very practical and pragmatic, Sam is a dreamer. He views his experiences as song lyrics, finding the beauty in everything. Together they fit together like pieces of a puzzle, each giving the other what they need to be complete. As they work through trying to experience a whole relationship in a matter of weeks, they are also trying to find a \\"rogue\\" wolf, a former classmate who was thought to be dead. The wolves in Ms. Stiefvater's world change according to the temperature. They're human in the warm months and wolf when it's cold. Her use of temperature at each chapter heading sets the urgency of the scenes.<br /><br />The one thing I didn't care for was that there didn't seem to be any positive parenting influences. With the exception of Sam's pack leader, Beck, who had a few issues of his own, the parents of the teens were self-absorbed, absent, and/or clueless.<br /><br />This book is like a painting; a work of art - the beauty is in the words. Can I use the word \\"beautiful\\" to describe Ms. Stiefvater's writing? (It's my blog, I vote yes.) When I think about this book I picture a painting in my head - stark white with splotches of color - bits of red dotted randomly around the canvas representing Grace's mother, light brown for her father. Sam is huge swaths of earthy green cutting across the canvas, and Grace is ice blue, like sunshine on snow. Add some black for Sam's pack and warm yellow for Grace's friends, and the painting is complete.<br /><br />This book drew me in from the first few pages and I didn't want to put it down. I bawled like a baby during pages 341-344, and then again at the end for completely different reasons. As soon as I finish this review I'm going to read it again.e parents of the teens were self-absorbed, absent, and/or clueless.

B001UV4XI8|5.0|The Harry Potter films continue to get better with each succeeding film for me. \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I\\" is the action thriller of the Potter films. Fans already know what's going to happen and for those who don't I'm not going to spoil it except to state up front that the film doesn't have a conclusion but ends on a great cliff hanger.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks exceptionally good--the image is crisp and true to the theatrical presentation of the film. The look of the film is much more subdued with colors that are often muted to reflect the much more serious and dangerous elements of the story.<br /><br />The audio sounds terrific with a strong 5.1 lossless mix.<br /><br />The DVD that is included has a substandard transfer. I'm not sure what Warner has thinking here as many people will just be buying the DVD (perhaps they were thinking that most folks would be watching the show on their car DVD players to keep the kids occupied).<br /><br />Special features include a featurette on shooting the scene for the seven Harrys. We also get \\"Maximum Movie Mode\\" the interactive feature that acts as a commentary track taking you behind-the-scenes of the movie while you're watching it.<br /><br />We also get a promotional featurette on the creation and opening of the theme park in Florida. There are a number of deleted scenes which while they don't necessarily add to the film per se do give us some additional character moments. There's also a featurette on the cast playing golf (!)which seemed kind of stretching. There's also a featurette on the recording of the soundtrack.<br /><br />There isn't a disc with a digital copy for those who use such things--you have to download the digital copy of the film. Demerits to Warner for advertising it on the package which implies that there is a digital copy disc inside which is a bit misleading. This isn't the first itme Warner has done this with the digital downloads--they did this also for a season of \\"Supernatural\\".<br /><br />The film certainly deserves five stars--it's a terrific, entertaining and thrilling ride. The transfer for the Blu-ray is stellar and the extras including the \\"Maximum Movie Mode\\" are good if not as exceptional as I'd liked (I'm assuming they're saving material for one of those \\"Ultimate\\" boxed sets).<br /><br />For those that are interested Best Buy has an exclusive Blu-ray disc that includes two featurettes that take you behind-the-scenes including the scene set in Picadilly and the location shooting of the film. Some of the interviews are recycled from other material on the set but there's also footage that isn't included in any of the other featurettes.<br /><br />Over all this is a good set with the film being exceptional.

B004TE6F66|4.0|I recently succumbed to all the rave reviews and read Maggie Stiefvater's Shiver; it blew me away. I was thrilled when I received a copy of the 2nd book in the trilogy, Linger, for review. For some reason, it took me a bit to get into Linger, but once I did I was hooked. I'd say Linger has two storylines going on: Grace and Cole.<br /><br />Linger picks up a few months after Shiver left off - Grace and Sam are still together and things are pretty much in a routine. Grace goes to school, Sam works, and at night the sleep together in Grace's room, unbeknownst to her parents, and Isobel is now a part of their small circle of friends.<br /><br />Grace has started getting headaches and then fevers and nosebleeds; which would be a regular part of life except that she's never been sick before. She feels strange, and is pretty sure she knows what the problem is - she has the same strange scent as the dead wolf she found in the woods. Sam is starting to accept the fact that he has a future, and won't acknowledge that Grace is sick. Together they spend a large part of the book ignoring it. Grace and Sam finally admit to each other that there is a problem, and the solution is iffy at best.<br /><br />As far as Cole's story - I didn't like Cole at first. He was self-absorbed and irritating. As the story progressed and he spent time with Isobel, I began to like him a bit more. It's weird how two egocentric characters could bring out sympathy in each other. I'll be curious to see how (if?) both of their characters grow in the next book.<br /><br />Linger felt a bit more fragmented then Shiver, but I think this may have been the author's intention. One of the things I liked about Shiver was that Ms. Stiefvater titled the chapters as temperatures, conveying the sense of urgeny in the story. In Linger, that's not an issue anymore; it's almost like instead of urgency you feel almost a sense of resignation? defeat? inevitability? at both Grace's illness and Cole's attempts to escape his demons.<br /><br />So, all in all, I enjoyed Linger very much. I love the way Sam thinks in lyrics and poetry; it's one of my favorite facets of the book. Although the events at the end of the book were not a surprise to me, the way the book ended was a surprise - and now I am anxiously awaiting the third book, Forever (out in July 2011).I enjoyed Linger very much.

B004NOH9LW|1.0|The short review is...\\"boring\\".  I mean, you REALLY have to be absolutely bored out of your mind to get any enjoyment whatsoever out of this movie.  I think I'd rather have a root canal than sit through this movie again.  At least with that kind of oral surgery, something new and 'interesting' would happen.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays a 'retired' psychic who finds his special talent is more of a curse than a gift.  Gee, we've never seen that before.<br /><br />We have a French woman who really has no business being in an American movie.  And by that I mean, the story itself did not require the character to be French, did not require the viewer to read half the movie as it was spoken in French.  The story, such as it was, would have been perfectly well served had the Marie character been played by another American who spoke English.<br /><br />And just what kind of a story is it?  Well, given the title and trailer, you might think it some kind of supernatural story about life after death, about what comes next.  But the movie really only glances on the subject, and offers absolutely nothing new at that.  It's really more of a romantic drama than anything else.  Except there's not a whole lot of romance going on...or drama for that matter.  It's two plus hours that only George Costanza could love - a show about \\"nothing\\".<br /><br />In summary, if you have any plans at all to watch this movie, do yourself a favor and call your dentist instead.  Trust me, you'll have more fun.
B004GHNHVW|5.0|The new Paul Simon album holds many treasures.  A couple leap out straight away, like \\"Dazzling Blue\\" with its luscious vocals and \\"Rewrite\\" which is full of sly humour until it packs its big emotional punch with the verse about the father.  The songs in the album's second half are sinuous and subtle and they may take more time to reveal their mastery.  But this is the best part about all Paul's studio albums since \\"Rhythm of the Saints\\".  Less immediately gratifying than his earlier work, their beauty is that they don't exhaust themselves in the first few listens.  Over time, more and more is revealed.  Different songs step to the forefront and a listener's favourites are liable to change.  I feel certain \\"So Beautiful\\" is going to offer these lasting pleasures too.  (Actually, now I think about it, the earlier albums which I played to death when new, return refreshed after time away from them, so maybe there's not that big a divide between the old and the new.)
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I am simply stunned with the negative reviews I have read. Whilst I understand that music is an incredibly personal thing it winds me up when people write so negatively about an album they clearly dont understand.

A true genius if you dont like him then dont waste this page with your rubbish!!

0316056863|5.0|Tina Fey seems to have built her career on being open and honest about her shortcomings, fears, idiosyncrasies and normalcy and it's refreshing.  Without turning into a 1000 page word-fest, she brushes on her early childhood, teens and college years with funny stories and anecdotes.  She recollects how she got into show business, her tenure at SNL and her love of her current show, 30 Rock.<br /><br />I get the feeling after reading this book, that she is anti-Hollywood.  As if, she would be very approachable. She hasn't forgotten where she's come from.<br /><br />This was a light, humorous read, with many laugh-out-loud moments.  Thoroughly enjoyed.

B001UV4XI8|4.0|This review is not about the movie. Be sure that you realize that you're getting Blu-Ray/DVD. You also need to be aware that the Special Features disc is only Blu-Ray. Wish I'd realized that before I bought this edition. I have no use for Blu-Ray and now I can't see the Special Features.
B004MKM8L8|3.0|The Deathly Hallows Part One is by far the worst Harry Potter film to date.  I'm sure that Part Two will be really awesome, because the exciting scenes shown in the trailers are from Part Two, where all the great action appears to be.  The thing I disliked about Part One is they kept on showing them in various tents all over the place.  Boring!!! Oh let's see Harry in a tent in a forest, oh how about a different forest!  Of all the films I actually fell asleep in this one, because of all the repetitive tent scenes.  It wasn't a total bore fest due to the building to the climax, but I thought more time could have been spent with character or plot development rather than yet another tent scene!

I had to buy them seperately, as they weren't available together at the time, but it was totally worth it.
B004UJ6YNO|3.0|Jessie J has been around for several years it seems, penning hits for other artists (most notably Miley Cyrus' 'Party in the U.S.A.). It seems just now that she is really beginning to catch fire both in the US and in her native UK. 'Price Tag', the first commercially successful single by Jessie, has already gone to the top spot on the UK charts and is steadily climbing the charts in the US. Now, she has released her debut album, and while she shows amazing signs of promise, there isn't a concise idea here that shows anything about Jessie J as an artist, other then she has some stellar pipes.    Price Tag: The most well-known track on the album, this definitely gets a boost from some great Dr. Luke production. Overall, it has a nice island vibe with B.o.B. dropping a solid rap. A very pleasant song. B    Nobody's Perfect: This track rises most due to Jessie's invested singing, paired with a solid hook and some fairly well-written lyrics. Definite single potential. B+    Abracadabra: Dr. Luke gives some more solid production, but this has some weak writing that makes it a little weaker than its predecessor. Another good track, but not exceptional by any means. B    Big White Room: This track may have sounded better as a bonus to end the album; right here it stops the album dead. A vocally profound performance with some very nice lyrics, but this one suffers a bit from unnecessary length. B-    Casualty of Love: Another song held up by Jessie's vocals. The writing is okay here, and the production is inoffensive, but not mind-blowing. B    Rainbow: This one offers a bit of a rap break, and has the most catchy chorus of any song on the album. A shiny gem with an uplifting message. B+    Who's Laughing Now: There's a bit of grating spoken beats in the middle, but overall this is another solid song. Instantly catchy, but maybe not in a good way. B    Do It Like a Dude: One of the best songs on the album, this is a track stuffed full of attitude. Jessie does an awesome jobselling it, and it's a shame this one didn't take off more. B+    Momma Knows Best: The weakest track on the album. The production could have been better if it didn't seem so left-field that it distracted from the premise. It doesn't help that it is also lyrically weak. C    L.O.V.E.: This doesn't help to pick the album back up, with lyrics that just drag the album further down. Not a bad song, but it suffers from placement on the track listing. C+    Stand Up: Another uplifting track, this builds a bit of steam for the album. An unoriginal concept with production that turns out just okay, this one fades in a bit. B    I Need This: One of the most vocally strong and emotionally invested songs, this track should have switched places with 'Big White Room'. A very strong performance by Jessie on this one, with some nice lyrics to match. B+    Who You Are: A great track to end the album on. This one leaves the listener thinking the album is better then it actually was, which is always a nice effect. Jessie's vocals are strong, the lyrics are uplifting (a running trend here, it seems), and the production doesn't overpower her. B+    There's no doubt that Jessie J will be successful. 'Price Tag' is likely to place in the top 10 on Billboard, and there are enough adequate songs her to keep her momentum going until her sophomore release. Adequate, though, is really the issue with this album. Only a few songs manage to surpass this status, and it's always by a small margin. The selling point is really Jessie J's vocals; there isn't anything here that a female vocalist, UK or US bred, hasn't done either equally or better.    Recommended Tracks: Price Tag, Nobody's Perfect, Do It Like a Dude, I Need This, Who You Are

B003YD00RS|5.0|The Checklist Manifesto, by Atul Gawande, tells a remarkable story about how a simple tool - a checklist - could change the way many of us work in the future. As our work becomes more and more complex, having a checklist to follow might literally save our lives. It will most certainly save us money. The book is full of remarkable stories, in fact, and they all have that one little thing in common. A checklist.<br />  According to Gawande, in many industries complexity has increased far beyond what even the most extensive training can prepare any one person to cope with on their own. Gawande uses a construction site for a high rise commercial building to show how the building industry has evolved from the \\"Master Builder\\" age, where one person was responsible for the design of a project and then personally oversaw the execution of all aspects of it, to a coordinated group effort requiring the expertise of many specialists. And he points to medicine as an example of a field still trying to make the \\"Master Builder\\" model work.<br />  When a delegate from the World Health Organization (WHO) asked Gawande for his help in devising a way to make surgeries safer in developing nations, he at first didn't see how it could be done. He had, by that time, seen that checklists could help reduce mistakes in some medical procedures, but considered surgery to have too many variables for a checklist to take into account. The checklist would be inconveniently long, or too vague, and would ultimately waste time. Still, he saw more instances where use of checklists in hospitals was lowering the incidence of surgical complications. Fewer complications saved lives, got patients home from the hospital sooner, and saved everyone money. Gawande decided to get his team together  and try again to develop a workable checklist. The results of their efforts I'll leave for you to discover. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
B000AS4L16|5.0|We finally got around to watching this magnificent documentary.  It seems to be slow going at the beginning but that is because of the importance of the subject matter.  It becomes like a long dinner that you must digest.  The horror of what occcured during their lifetime is etched on the faces and echoes in the voices of the people as they relate their experience.    We had no problem choosing the English subtitles. We are so glad to have Shoah and are ready to show it to anyone who denies the Holocaust.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I've been following Dave Grohl for about a year now (since he performed at the White House). What I've come to realize with this album is The  Foo Fighters write guitar riffs which borrow from the rock testament and infuse it into something brand new. The whole band sounds tight. This album reminds me how great it is to be alive. It's like when you hear something for the first time and know that 20 years from now, people will still be talking about it. This was the time. This was the moment.
0066620996|5.0|\\"You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end--which you can never afford to lose--with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be.\\" - Admiral James Stockdale<br /><br />I recently led a 2-day offsite meeting, on the heels of a major restructuring, to align executives and middle managers across the company behind a new strategic direction and operational discipline.  In preparing to lead the meeting, I reread two books that I have revisited repeatedly since my initial readings: Crossing the Chasm and Good to Great.<br /><br />Crossing the Chasm is my handbook for guiding an emerging-technology company from early to mainstream markets.  Good to Great is my handbook for guiding organizational change in turnaround situations.  The Stockdale Paradox, succinctly stated at the beginning of this post, was an apt starting point for the meeting.  In fact, I used three of the four basic practices in the chapter, \\"Confront the Brutal Facts,\\" as ground rules for group discussions:<br /><br />1. Lead with questions, not answers.<br />2. Engage in dialogue and debate, not coercion.<br />3. Conduct autopsies, without blame.<br /><br />The principles of focus and discipline pervade Good to Great.  The \\"Hedgehog Concept\\" and \\"Culture of Discipline\\" have become fundamental to my leadership practices.  And getting the right people on the bus, while essential to an ongoing enterprise, is critical to a successful turnaround.<br /><br />As the book states, \\"First, if you begin with who, rather than what, you can more easily adapt to a changing world.  Second, if you have the right people on the bus, the problem of how to motivate and manage people largely goes away.  Third, if you have the wrong people, it doesn't matter whether you discover the right direction.\\"<br /><br />Good to Great has taken some knocks over the past few years as some of the example companies have fallen from grace, including Circuit City and, most notably, Fannie Mae.  However, of the many business books I have read, this is one of a handful that I return to again and again for direction and inspiration.  To me, it is indispensible.s books I have read, this is one of a handful that I return to again and again for direction and inspiration.  To me, it is indispensible.
0670022411|1.0|This is not a supernatural novel!  It is a romance novel.  It is so full of padding that it resembles a thirty year old mattress, it sags so much!  The premise that the world is divided up between \\"creatures\\" ( witches, vampires and daemons)and the poor, cluless humans isn't original nor timely.  It is a rehash, without the imagination or Jo Rowlings plot device, except here it isdn't carried off near as well.  Then we have the incredible sexy (oh brother) dark, gothic, take-command, hero vampire!  It has been over-worked again and again.  It would be nice to see something original, but not here.  Honestly, the second half of the book might have been better than the first--I couldn't get through to that and gave up!  In defense of the author, I don't like romance novels.  Maybe a fan of Nora Roberts might enjoy this.
0756404738|5.0|I discovered the first book NOTW, luckily, only a couple of months before the sequel was released.  I say luckily because it streamlined the story into one continuing saga.  Waiting 4 years will test my powers of patience, while giving me the most enjoyable experience to re-read the first two to refresh.      I've read a lot of the complaints (albeit couched in terms of \\"loving the book series\\" despite them).  You won't find any of that here.  For \\"bookies\\" like me, Rothfuss's slow intricate treatment of his tale with Felurian, rather than the normal glossing of a quick scene, gave greater insight into the Fae character and Kvothe's experience.  (Spoiler!) And the hero's initiation into the mysteries of the sexual experience ran true to the epic sense of this book - Kvothe's lack of experience had more to do with his struggles, shyness and profound fear of scaring off Denna than his lack of ability. Felurian taught Kvothe as expertly as a prostitute, slowly and over time, but one without a bad name or any self-consciousness of her true nature.      Kvothe himself is an anti-hero with a hero's gloss - self-deprecating, flawed, funny, bold, quick-tempered and quick-witted with unimaginably bad luck at times which serves to allow all of us to slip seamlessly into his shoes (from our own egotistic perspectives).      How often does any of come across a work of great wordsmithing, a story that carries you along and loses you completely in the weaving of the tale?  The Wise Man's Fear carries on what was begun in NOTW and instead of ending directly after a cliffhanger, leaves you gently bobbing at sea waiting breathlessly for the next installment.  Whether 3 books or 7, this story is an epic feast that manages to saturate your intellect while making you hungry for more.  Both books are worth a second read through just to catch details you missed the first time around from his excellent use of foreshadowing.  This is simply one of the best series since Terry Brooks first started The Sword of Shannara, although in a different, more gritty and detailed writing style.  Hats off to Patrick Rothfuss, one of my new favorite authors!

B001UV4XI8|5.0|Harry Potter has always been one of my favorite books series. It is, by no means, a \\"children's\\" story but one of the most wonderful literary works ever written, with some of the best character development, moral lessons and meaningful themes found in fiction. For this reason, Harry Potter has attracted and continues to attract millions of fans of all ages, genders and nationalities. Deathly Hallows is no exception; it has always been my favorite book in the HP series and is now one of my favorite movies. Period.     Unlike the previous film installments in the series, Deathly Hallows-Part 1 provides an exploration of characters, as well as an emotional build-up to the conclusion; it stands in a league of its own. Everything from the cinematography to the soundtrack is well done and quite true to the book. For me, it's a complete transformation--one that makes me feel like I'm watching a movie that's part of a different series altogether.    I have read several reviews of Deathly Hallows here and on other sites. Though most are quite favorable, there are a few that criticize different aspects of the movie. Though I can understand certain people disliking the plot or pacing, I completely disagree about the criticisms about the performances.  In my opinion, the trio's acting, particularly that of Rupert Grint, was excellent.  There are specific scenes such as the fight in the tent, the destruction of the Horcrux, Ron's return speech and Malfoy Manor that are spot-on. The performances in the past HP films might be considered mediocre by some, and that's fine; however, this should not be the case with Deathly Hallows.     When this movie came out, I was a bit nervous as to how it would turn out. Needless to say, I was so pleasantly surprised that I ended up coming back to see it several times while it was playing in theaters. Now that I own the set, I will be watching the movie over and over again at home.
B002ZCY7TG|3.0|My comment is not about the show, I love it, have all 8 seasons. I think you would  better off to buy the regular DVD, than the Blu Ray. The blacks, during the night  scenes, especially outside, look terrible. All kinds of little red pixels in the  picture. Some of the dark interior shots look almost as bad. Am watching on a   new Sony Bravia XBR, with a new Sony 3d rated DVD player, so don't think it's  the equipment, just poor quality control. So save money, and buy regular DVD.  Just my opinion.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|Ok, there are enough comments about the plot, music and other aspects of this movie that I'll just skip that part of the review.    What I did want to comment on is the quality of the 3D.  Absolutely stunning.    Now, a little background here.  The first 3D title that I purchased for my Panasonic Plasma TV was an IMAX space station movie.  This movie was heavy on the eye-popping effects, and what that did was to leave me and my two guests feeling heavily eye strained by the end of the short 40 minutes of the movie.  The 3D effect was nifty and all, but it left me wondering if I would ever use the 3D function of my TV to any great extent.    The second 3D title was an IMAX Deap Sea movie.  Fortunately it was a lot easier on the eyes and didn't cause nearly the eye strain that the space station movie caused.  I had a little hope, but was apprehensive about whether my pre-order of this collector edition would ever see the 3D disc taken out and watched on a regular basis.  Two hours of 3D like that in the IMAX movies and you would probably never see straight again.    Enter the arrival of my Tron Legacy DVD's on release day.  Excited to see how the 3D of Tron would look on my TV, I rushed home after work and went straight to the first 3D scene in the movie (I had already seen it 6 times in the theaters).  I was absolutely stunned. Within two minutes I got really excited that the 3D effect was so much better than in any of 3D theaters I had seen it in, and that includes every possible iteration:  IMAX, Dolby 3D, RealD 3D, and active shutter glasses at a smaller theater.  The picture on this 3D Blu-Ray disc is ultra-sharp.  It is so clear, incredibly stunning and very easy on the eyes.  So much so that by the end of the movie, I felt absolutely no eye strain.    Thanks to Tron Legacy's less gratuitous use of eye-popping effects, the 3D becomes much less of a gimmick and far more of a way to immersed the audience in the world of Tron.    Lastly, there's the sound.  Since Ilive in an apartment, I can't listen to the movie with in Dolby Prologic mode.  Not because I don't want to, but because of the unbelievable amount of bass that it will generate.  Now, this is not a bad thing at all. This is a good thing--for those of you who can crank it up and let this soundtrack really rock.  Because, wow, if you have a powerful enough sound system it will sound just like the movie theater with earth shattering bass that is sure to excite seismometers for miles around.    If you're looking for a good way to make your friends jealous of your 3D home theater system, get this movie.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Oh my good gravy, this album rocks!!! The first five songs alone are worth the price of admission. The rest of the album could have been campfire songs and I would have been okay with that. Arlandria is my favorite track by far with Rope coming in at number 2. Apparently, Rope has been on the radio for a month or so, but I despise corporate radio so I literally heard it for the first time a few days ago when I purchased the album. If only the Foos had brought back Pat Smear a long time ago. Don't get me wrong, the last few albums have been solid, but the addition of Smear produces a whole new dynamic. And thank God for Dave Grohl! Rock music would be dead without this guy. Yes there are some awesome prog rock acts out there such as Porcupine Tree and Radiohead, but aside from Pearl Jam, the Foos are IT in terms of truly great modern rock! The musical landscape is already dominated by a bunch of pathetic hip hoppers, but at least we have Grohl carrying the flame for all of us rockers!
0316056863|4.0|I loved Tina Fey's Sarah Palin and admit that I have never seen \\"30 Rock.\\" So when Terry Gross interview Ms. Fey, I felt a need to read this book, that coupled with having watched the program when she received the Mark Twain Award. She really is an amazing comedian.<br />I did not read all of the book because I found myself disinterested in some parts. However, on the whole, this has an authentic voice. And I agree with those who say this seems to be an honest memoir, something one cannot say for a lot of others who write so-called memoirs.

B004LWZVZC|2.0|As a history fan and costume drama lover, I was excited when I saw the trailers for *The Conspirator.* I have to say the movie did not live up to its promise, though. It kept having moments where it could have broken through and become very gripping, but it never actually got there.    Of course *The Conspirator* is not about Mary Surratt but Guantanamo, so it shouldn't be too surprising that the Civil War aspect is given no more depth than the window dressing it is. The preachiness was annoying (although I actually agree that the government has no business suspending habeas corpus), but, from Robert Redford, I expected it.    What I did not expect, though, was that someone could take as intense and tumultuous a time as the Civil War and make it flat and uninteresting. Frankly, my mind wandered a lot of the time, except when it was noting oddities like how Frederick Aiken was portrayed as a single man with a girlfriend, when in fact he was married at that time.    In the end, I just found *The Conspirator* unconvincing, unengaging, and disappointing. It felt like the kind of movie we used to have to watch in History class--only at least back then I wouldn't have had to cough up $11 to see it. I would say if you want to see it, wait till it comes out on DVD.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I bought this controller a few months ago and right off the bat, i noticed that it seemed to be more cheaply made than the dualshock 3 controller that came with my ps3. The R1 and L1 buttons were very loose and wiggly, and this controller was noticably lighter in comparison. yesterday, I was playing a game and the right joystick just broke. Keep in mind that I am a very light gamer who plays a few hours a week. I am extremely confused because it definitely says Sony on the back, but the label is definitely different. Be careful when purchasing \\"official sony dualshock 3\\" since it may not be the same quality that you are expecting for 42 dollars plus shipping.
B001EYU1VO|4.0|This Joystick was bought for my current deployment overseas.  I have used it successfully with Microsoft Flight Sim X with Acceleration, DCS Blackhawk, Falcon 4.0, and Rise of Flight.  I have also used it with Battlefield series, however the center null zone issue makes it the difficult to use competitively.  By this I mean that if you set the null zone too small then the joystick will jump when you overcome the mechanical centering device.  If you set it too large then it takes way too long to change directions in-game.  This was not an issue in the Flight Sims, as I just adjusted the null zone to correspond exactly to mechanical center.    The dual throttles DO work in both FSX and DCS.  Proper set up of the engine controls in the game menus is needed.    The other reviews about the buttons may affect some buyers.  I have been lucky so far (4 Months of play), but the number three button definatly feels loose.  There is also very little resistance to abrupt pitch down manuevers due to the arrangment of the feet, causing the joystick to lean foward.    Overall a good joystick (not great)    Pros-     Throttle and Joystick in one unit.    Small and lightwaeight for travel  Can be disassemble for travel.  Can be adjusted to fit your handsize.  Good in game responses    Cons-     Buttons may break if you are not careful.  Software is poor (and not really needed for most newer games.  Joystick feet are poorly designed

B000092T6M|3.0|I wish to say first off that this review is for the extended edition of the movie, not the theatrical release.<br /><br /> When I bought this version of Robin Hood- Prince of Thieves, I first thought that I was only getting special bonus material, not realising that they added scenes to the movie. I would have accepted the extra scenes, maybe even been pleasantly surprised by them, has they added anything to the movie. Instead, I found that sometimes, those who edit the film for theaters know better than those who direct them.<br /><br /> The film, in its theatrical version, is not perfect, but it is not weighed down by odd, and sometimes contrary bits of story. The extended version made both the characters of Azeem and Friar Tuck seem rather perverted, and the character of the Sheriff of Nottingham seem more whiny than menacing. They also added a small bit where one minor character's tongue is cut out, then they have him speaking in the very last part of the movie. The only addition at truely added to the story is the one of the witch telling the Sheriff of his birth, and even that seemed to bog the the movie down.<br /><br /> I wish I had saved my money and bought the original version, which has a better pace.

0307595862|5.0|When you think you have figured out who the snowman is about five or six times but you are wrong, that is a good book! This isn't my normal kind of read, so for me to give it 5 stars is quite the deal! I really loved all the details, someone might get bogged down in them, but I really thought it made the story so complete.<br /><br />Some of the details I wasn't sure what they had to do with the story, but much like a detective, you aren't sure what they have to do with the case, but file them away for future use. They all came together like a puzzle. A perfect cresendo.<br /><br />The book starts out with Detective Harry Hole getting a letter from some source claiming to be \\"the snowman\\" --- from there you have missing women, a snowman body with a severed head on top -- I don't want to go into more details and spoil it but you will enjoy the thrilling, heart stopping ride. I did!<br /><br />Who would have guessed!!!! If you do guess, maybe you are a better detective than I am I suppose! However, I thought Jo Nesbo did a wonderful job writing this wonderful thriller. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
B004I2K4E8|5.0|I was only able to catch part of the 25th anninversary presentation on PBS.  with what I saw I knew I needed to purchase the blue-ray version that was available on amazon.com.  it is truly the greatest musical of all time.  the voices of almost the entire cast were incredible.  the weakest was the Jonas brother.  my wife and I have already watched it three times since we received it.  we are also anxiously waiting for the 10th anniversary version to come out on blue-ray.  the cast of that version was also incredible.
0316056863|4.0|I'm not exactly sure what I expected when I started reading this book, but I'm pretty sure that I didn't get it.  [[ASIN:031617789X Bossypants]] is a brief look back at Tina's life - a few defining moments, some significant seasons of change, a handful of seemingly randomly stories that end with a \\"the moral of the story is\\" thought - and how she went from being an awkward, insecure young girl to become a successful, popular, insecure NBC writer/actor.<br /><br />Fey's prime focus is on the female perspective: where identity comes from, body image, the barriers to women in comedy, and the dilemma of working-motherhood. Fey is transparent, honest, and self-depricatingly funny in sharing her journey. Yet, that is where I somehow felt duped. I think I expected something more accessible and unisexishly entertaining. [[ASIN:031617789X Bossypants]] was not that.<br /><br />In fact, one of the early chapters disturbed me in such a way that I think it prevented me from actually finding humor in much of Fey's story.* Recalling an experience where a group of women were asked about when they first felt like a grown women and not girls, Tina writes:<br /><br />\\"The group was racially and economically diverse, but the answers had a very similar theme. Almost everyone first realized they were becoming a grown woman when some dude did something nasty to them...There were pretty much zero examples like `I first knew I was a woman when my [parents] took me out to dinner to celebrate my success on the debate team.' It was mostly men yelling s-- from cars.\\"<br /><br />Admittedly, the reality of this observation struck me in such a way that I was unable to get out from the weight of it for much of the rest of the book. While Tina continued on to describe her first job and her experience working at The Second City in Chicago, all I could think about was how much I wanted to hug my daughter. By the time Fey reached the point in her story where she had joined the SNL writing staff - the part I was most looking forward to - I had already spent too much time wrestling with this ugliness that I was largely unable to reengage.<br /><br />I did not love this book. Nor did I hate it. I just think I got more than I bargained for. My guess is that most women would appreciate Fey's candor in addressing all these issues, and would find her stories of work, marriage, and motherhood refreshing and encouraging. Perhaps other guys reading the book would not get caught up in the same statements that I did. Ultimately, Fey had more to say that I expected, and I was challenged in ways that I wouldn't have anticipated as a result of that. Perhaps that is not a bad thing.<br /><br />________________<br /><br />* This, mind you, is not a knock on Tina. I actually applaud her for sharing this portion of her experience. The problem is that she is exactly right.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the book review bloggers program.

B001FB4VZS|1.0|Al Gough and Miles Millar's departure from the series was palpable in this season.  Their departure was so detremental that characters one had been following for the past 7 years up and turn a complete 180 from what you'd been seeing.  The writers clearly did not know what to do with the character of Chloe Sullivan, who has become a series fan favorite, and one sees her character that has long held a passion for reporting stumble through the series feigning a relationship with Jimmy Olsen and trying to figure out the arrival of Davis Bloome.  Also, the character of Lois Lane is contunually thrown in haphazardly into stories, with no clear arc other than the powers that be having to conform to comic book/movie history of having Lois & Clark pair up.  The strangest move yet was to have Clark Kent suddenly be thrown into the Daily Planet as a reporter when he had not even been working at the Planet, even part time.  It is a season that is filled with poor attempts to close storylines that had been carrying for the past 7 years while driving towards the train-wreck that was season 9.  Truly a sad turn of events for a program that started out with such an independent streak of revamping a character that's been around for decades and giving it new life by taking it back to the drawing board.

0385528752|5.0|What I love the most about the book \\"Switch: How to Change Things When Change is Hard\\" is how it gets my creative juices flowing. The book opened the flood gates to think creatively and even more how to facilitate positive change.<br /><br />The book builds on this premise: Successful changes has a common pattern, and what may surprise you -- an identifiable  pattern of 3 simple steps:<br /><br />1. Direct the Rider: Get your brain engaged. Find the bright spots (my favorite concept in the book) and script the moves that get you to your intended destination. Know where you are going and lay out the map.<br /><br />2. Motivate the Elephant: Feelings are fickle, aren't they? You want to lose weight, you know you should, but an opportunity at a chocolate doughnut usually beats a chance at following the diet every time. Motivate the elephant deals with those heart issues that often trump where the brain wants to go.<br /><br />3. Shape the Path: If you can make that path downhill, you will make the road easier as momentum builds.<br /><br />My favorite chapter in the book is Chapter 2:  Find the bright spots. Most organization focus, almost obsessively with what's wrong. Bright spots change the focus to not only what's going right, but why is it going right. Learn the lesson, magnify the impact.<br /><br />Chip and Dan Heath in this chapter tell the story of Jerry Sternin who in 1990 worked for Save the Children. They send him to Vietnam, give him 6 months and no budget, to \\"make a difference\\" in the nutrition issues they battle. For most people the approach is to first identify the problems. In most cases, that's the common step. Identify the problem.<br /><br />Sternin instead traveled to rural villages and sought mothers whose children were healthiest based on weighing them and comparing the results. He then looked at what these mom with the healthiest children did. He found his \\"bright spots\\" and transformed the nutrition of the entire village. Turned out the difference was not the amount of food (it was the same for both groups), but how often they ate. The healthiest children ate 4 meals instead of 2. That simple switch improved nutrition in the village. Adding a little protein to the diet, helped even more.<br /><br />From Switch,I learned to look for bright spots. What's working and how can I get that to work for me? I also learned tell the stories. One of the strengths of the book is the numerous case studies and examples that are given. They not only teach the concept, they opened my thinking to areas I need to switch in my life and my organization.<br /><br />Check the book out for yourself. Read Chapter 1 in the looking inside.

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This movie was Triumphant!  What a story of Courage, Strength, Heart, Will, and Accomplishment!  This Girl shows all of us what is possible on this earth!!!    The movie went at a good pace... I took my 7 year old daughter with me, and neither of us were bored or un-content during the film.  The theater was full, but you could hear a pin drop, as every single person was intently staring in AWWW at the big screen...  I found myself shedding a few tears at various times!    I compare this movie with the likes of Cinderella Man, The Hurricane, Remember the Titans & Secretariat.    Helen Hunt & Dennis Quaid did fantastic in their respective roles...    I loved at the end of the movie, while the credits played, they played video clips of the real girl behind the amazing story! The clips also updated what she did in her life after the accident!  I would love to meet this girl someday!!!    I give this movie an A+, and reccomend you go and see it on the big screen!  Thanks for reading my review...

0060557818|2.0|This is one of those books I zip through, only to realize upon completion that the book isn't actually very good. But since some of Gaiman's other work has been very well-received, perhaps this just wasn't the right place for me to start.<br /><br />As other reviewers have described, Neverwhere is about a young man living in modern-day London, who through an act of kindness toward a stranger gets sucked into the world of London Below, where people live dangerous lives in the tunnels and Tube stations below the city and are nearly invisible to the inhabitants of London Above. He joins a girl named Door and her companions on their quest to find out the truth behind Door's family's murders.<br /><br />In all fairness, this book just wasn't my cup of tea. First, because it's essentially an urban-fantasy-thriller; my impression of Gaiman was that he's a more literary writer--and okay, there's a Shakespeare reference or two, but this book is still a thriller, with a fast-paced but unmemorable plot consisting of constant rushing about the tunnels of London Below, and characters who are decent and likeable but not particularly well-developed. Second, I didn't realize that the book was adapted from a TV series, and it reads a bit like a video game: the plot consists mostly of running around and questing after various items, there are lots of tired tropes (the murdered family in the backstory, the mysterious waif with magical powers, the mysterious manipulative villain) and the end is predictable. Silliest was the important plot location that, we're solemnly informed, can only be accessed \\"the easy way\\" once by any individual; the second visit must be via an underground labyrinth. Naturally, this is never explained; do plot coupons, dungeons and boss battles need to be explained? We all understand that the point is to give the player a chance to... but wait a minute, this is a novel, not a role-playing game.<br /><br />The setting, meanwhile, is an interesting concept but not fully developed; like the protagonist, I feel like I was whisked through a maze of tunnels, but have no idea how to get anywhere and am not entirely convinced they still exist when I'm not there. And Gaiman explicitly raises a lot of questions that are never answered (the magic is never explained at all, nor are any limitations placed on it beyond the requirements of the plot; the villains don't seem to be human, though we're never told what they are). The parallels drawn between the citizens of London Below and homeless people (\\"those who fall through the cracks\\") are interesting; I'm just not sure that they actually work. After all, the Below-ers are literally invisible to the Above-ers, and there's some implication that the Below-ers lead more interesting or meaningful lives. On the other hand, part of the point of fantasy is to comment on reality, and the analogies can't always be exact.<br /><br />So I didn't think much of this book, and am not sure if I'll try a different Gaiman book in the future; but I recognize that it may just be me, and if you're looking for a quick fantasy adventure (but not necessarily light; it's gruesome in places) this may be just the book for you.he protagonist, I feel like I was whisked through a maze of tunnels, but have no idea how to get anywhere and am not entirely convinced they still exist when I'm not there.

1592401791|5.0|I've read quite a few Beatle books and IMO this is the best one I've ever read. Emerick gives you an insiders view into the recording process of the Beatles and how it varied from album to album/song to song and also an insight to the individual personalities and the strenghth's and weaknesses of each beatle as he sees it. Yes he does have a bias towards Paul but it's his book and his opinion and he surely knew the Beatles better than anyone one of us. He gives the others their just dues as he also points out their shortcomings. To me his opinion seems to be just an honest assessment not an attempt to make anyone look bad. Lots of great memories and privy information in this book, a must read for any Beatles fan!
B004EC5IV6|2.0|This won't be a popular post with the sheeple, but it is my opinion. I am a fan of the original series which was flawed but mostly a masterpiece and the first movie was very good. I had high hopes about this one's new direction.  That being said this movie is close to being awful. I would rate it a very low C-. I will watch the next two movies only for Kaworu's part, but won't make the same mistake of buying them. I should have known there was a reason 2.22 was so cheap, save your money, if you need to see it.. rent this or watch it . I am trading my copy back in to Amazon. Hideaki Anno should be ashamed that the Gainex cash cow has fallen to this level. First we are introduced to the new experimental Eva pilot Mari. She should be named \\"Mari Sue\\" because she seems like a made up character from  really bad fan fiction written by 15 year olds. It is obvious by her boob size she is the new it girl for the figuring market for desperate guys who crave the always promised \\"fan service\\", but this time from a girl in glasses. (megane ko) She is given some of the more important parts. She is supposedly a secret badass who can almost single handedly endures pain to kill angels and help Shinji overcome his doubt at piloting his Eva. An example of stupid plot holes is we are told that Asuka was in graduate school and is a captain, to illustrate her awesomeness at her young age ... so then why does she go to school with Shinji? I admit the graphics are amazing, the colors really pop since they are almost neon in some scenes. My advice is rent, don't buy!

This book also likes to use terms that not only offend me as a human being but also just make me horribly mad. The worst of which was \\"pregger,\\" referring to a pregnant woman. So between this and all of the references to the dog as \\"fur face\\" I just did not enjoy this book.  I don't know why I finished this book, but I'm sorry to say I did.

0743298039|1.0|I read this for my book club.  I was in the minority, but I couldn't stand The Thirteenth Tale.   I was excited to read it, but after the first few pages it became a chore.   Setterfield has an extensive vocabulary, but she choked the life and mystery out of her writing with her abundance of details.  It was also highly repetitious,  Margaret frequently highlighted what was \\"important\\" from her interviews with Vida, and through Hester's diary she retold huge sections of text without adding new information.    Having Margaret who lives in the present day receive and send hand written correspondence to business people bothered me.    The author clearly loves gothic novels, but it did not work in a modern setting.    Not to mention I had a good idea what the main plot twist was, long before it was revealed.    I just can't recommend this book.

I still don't know what happened at the conclusion of the story, but the worst part for a book of this genre, is that I do not care.  I was unable to connect to or care about most of the characters.  The author wrote some wonderfully descriptive passages, but they lead nowhere.  Often they were about teacups, sewing, or other minutia and gave an ambiance to the 1940s part of the story particularly,but did not move the narrative along.

Heal the Pain, Mother's Pride and Cowboys and Angels are some of the stand out tracks.    Faith just recently was remastered, and this album could stand it as well (could use some additional bass).

B003F3NEBG|5.0|This is easily one of the best restorations I've ever seen come to Blu Ray.  I A/B'd the old DVD and this restored Blu Ray, back and forth, when we first got the latter.  No comparison whatsoever.    The show was always excellent; don't get me wrong.  But now it's much more suited for larger televisions, especially as it's now widescreen.    Detractors, please understand: this was a 90s television miniseries.  I'll say again: this was a 90s television miniseries!!!  Thank God it was filmed; \\"I, Claudius\\" will never look so good from having been created on videotape, and none of the 90s Trek shows will ever make a grand an entrance on Blu Ray, as they were made on film but edited on standard definition video (the effects all made on video, too).    Those in charge of this restoration and transfer should get medals.  The end results are every bit as dazzling as (albeit admittedly different than) the restorations and transfers for \\"Wizard of Oz\\" or \\"Gone With The Wind\\".  Modern technology used to restore and beautify the original film.  Worth every penny to make the upgrade to Blu Ray, and the same cannot be said about the majority of other DVD-to-Blu Ray transfers.    Again, the show is wonderful either way.  Five stars for the show even if it's projected out the back of a dump truck.  No worries there.  But the Blu Ray is totally worth it.

I do however have to add that I try to not compare the two to each other as that would drive me insane with the amount of details that are in the books. That being said, I loved this movie and left the theater wanting more. More back story - More information on what was in this part - More more more. And this is a review of the Blu-Ray/DVD combo and not my thoughts of what they left out. This is a well put together set!    The Blu-Ray features do not disappoint. I'm thrilled with the \\"Maximum Movie Mode\\" or whatever it is that they call it. It's fantastic to get the additional details, scenes, reminders of previous movies, lines from the books, and trivia. I love the way that they supply the information too.

B002LBKDYE|3.0|Like the food industry, this movie falls short on presenting the science and statistics. There are several interesting sights, as well as some that will shock you pretty hard, but that's where the positives end.    Many stories were so slow and had so much repeated scenery that the whole film could've been compressed down to 20 minutes, leaving plenty of time for more detail. The organic section was confusing and was unclear in presentation on position. The end points to each section of the film delivered in interest, only to give way to a new topic entirely. There were only a few statistics in the film, i.e., those related to premature diabetes and costs. Much of the science is left uncertain, i.e., high fructose corn syrup is brought up as a topic, but then left unassociated with the rest of the film.    I was also frustrated to see \\"Person XYZ declined an interview\\" for every other person. Seriously, why the hell even include so many people if they wouldn't sit down with the producers? Go out there and find other people, and preferably people who can pop a story full of information. I feel like I paid my ticket for the show just to find out it's closed due to maintenance.    Two of the movie scenes were really dumb. As for the 10-minute immigrant video in the style of \\"COPS\\" - are you kidding me? There has to be a better way of showcasing \\"companies paying immigrants below minimum wage\\" than spending 15% of the film on gun scenes like these. As for the other scene, the dollar menu family of four who can't afford to eat, seriously that was just pathetic. If you're fat and can't afford to eat/not enough time... swap for skim milk or eat less.    Overall, the film feels like a string of loosely-connected partial interviews and hidden camera videos that have either a comical or sleepy feel, and sleepy in the not-detailed-enough sense. While the film showcases the evils of the food companies, this film has its own evil of selectively having you fill in the blanks... alot of blanks. I have no idea what Eric Schlosser was thinking when he visioned an industry-changing 90-minute film, but I doubt this was it. Just save yourself and go read Fast Food Nation. You'll appreciate the details a lot more, especially since the first 20 minutes of the film are basically a compressed summary of two of the chapters.

B003Y7L5W8|5.0|The day I bought the History of Modern in the music store, I was in the mood for some synthesizers.  I am sucker for them, but it took me a while to decide on what to get.  I wanted to get something I didn't have.  I was afraid of getting OMD's newest album because of fear that it would sound half-hearted, but I was astounded by how good it was.      I have the cd on repeat and even copied it to my Hi-MD minidiscs, my preferred medium in uncompressed pcm.  All I have to say about the album is that side one is the smoothest.  The second side starts with \\"The Future, The Past, and Forever After\\", which I had to get used to, but it segues to the wonderful \\"Sister Marie Says\\".      'Pulse' is another one that takes time to digest.  It's not for everyone.  The rest on side two is great.  I love the last three tracks.  Of note is that the U.S. release that I have has an extra track 14 \\"Save Me\\" with Aretha Franklin.  The song does stick out because it doesn't sound like the others with only Aretha Franklin singing, but hey it's Aretha Franklin.  How could you not love her.  Actually with that bonus track it segues quite well to the first track when on repeat.    With this album I can not believe how they sound.  They sound as if no time has passed since their heyday.  I needed to take a double take.  I love this album because they are not trying to be modern.  The inside sleeve has an interesting lesson on the history of modernism.  I love the whole concept.    I find it funny that people of my age in their twenties listen to bands that sound like OMD and call them innovative, fresh, new, modern.  But if they listen to the originals like OMD they would call them dated and so 80s.  I hate that.  OMD is awesome and I highly recommend this album.  I would say that I love 95% of the album.  The rest I will get used to.  I can't wait till I love 100% of the album.  I am getting there.  But loving 95% of the album from the first listen means a lot.  Not many album are like this.    It is a great new beginning.  I hope more comes from OMD.  Maybe they'll be like the Rolling Stones playing till god knows when.

The cards are large, colorful, shiny, and playfully illustrated. They are divided into color-coded groups - stretching, balancing, breathing, relaxation, etc. There is a section for partner yoga poses too if you ever use these in groups. Each card describes the exercise briefly and simply, and tells how it can help. Easy, fun, and simple - and kids love the big colorful cards.

B004G600A4|5.0|I am an artist and went to this movie hoping to see some beautiful art and got more than I had hoped for. I would say this is the most beautiful animation I have ever seen. I am a painter and I like the old masters including the traditional subject matter they paint; pastoral scenes drapery figures etc. This is the first animation, digital or traditional,  I have seen that has convincing and beautiful representation of all these things.  I have studied and been a fan of disney animation art for years, and as blasphemous as it may be to say this, stepping back and looking at the big picture, I think this surpasses classics such as snow white and pinocchio. The original drawings and watercolor paintings for those old classics are among my favorite works of art, and I doubt that the studies and original art for this and other recent animation is as beautiful, but I think the final resulting movie is even more beautiful because of the lighting and the impact of the increased realism. Also those old movies are dark; in mood, and also visually. Tangled has night scenes with beautiful bottom lighting etc, but the daylight scenes really feel like day - filled with sunlight - I find this uplifting and I bet kids do too on a subconscious level. I seems appropriate to entertainment for kids  I like toy story, monsters inc, finding nemo and many other recent animations, but Tangled, because of the setting, has things that the human soul loves, green pastoral scenes, quaint towns and castles, lights reflected in water, all created with wonderful feeling (and refinement that is head and shoulders above animation of such subject matter done in the 1960's, 70's 80's or 90's) . My favorite yet.

B004LWZW24|5.0|This movie was wonderful in the theater.  It was one scary movie!  I was mighty pleased and left the show still with chills up my back for about 5 minutes!  I would most definitely watch it again, even though I know what happens.<br /><br />A family of 5 (Mom, Dad, 2 young boys, and a baby girl) moves into a new house (not newly built, just new to them).  From the very beginning, there are \\"little\\" unsettling things, which are not necessarily anything bizarre. Duncan (age 8 ?) wakes up telling Mom, \\"I don't like my room\\".  Books placed on a shelf are found on the floor.  The baby girl seems to cry a lot (but then babies tend to do that).<br /><br />Things seem to escalate fairly quickly after Duncan falls in the somewhat spooky attic, seemingly ok but slipping into a coma during the night.  Fast-forward 3 months.  Duncan is still in a coma but is back home.  Mom is downstairs and begins to hear indiscernible voices on the baby monitor.<br /><br />The scary stuff continues to escalate when Mom realizes something is WRONG!--it just ain't normal!  Even moving to another house does not help!  (Uh oh--real bad sign.) She talks to her mother-in-law (Barbara Hershey), who has a friend Elise  and her paranormal investigators who just might be able to help.<br /><br />The story is about demons, unsettled \\"bad\\" spirits, possession, and astral travel.  I absolutely DO NOT recommend you allow your impressionable children to see this movie.  I found this flick pretty scary.  If you have any doubt as to your children seeing it, I suggest you see it first.  And by the way,<br /><br />Don't play on the Astral Plane . . .(unless you really know what you are doing.)
6304711905|5.0|Tombstone the movie is funny, sad and romantic with true American legends such as Wyatt Earp, Doc Holiday and Johnny Ringo. No wonder Tombstone Arizona has more than 400,000 tourists each year.    If you want to read the direct word for word script for this movie, click on setup, then languages, then for the hearing impaired.    Tombstone was filmed in Tucson Arizona, which makes the landscape authentic.    All of the actors and actresses were perfect as well as the soundtrack and narration.     If you want to see the best western movie of your life featuring the greatest American western legends, Tombstone will make you laugh, cry and fall in love with the old west of Tombstone Arizona.

0307595862|5.0|In \\"The Snowman,\\" by Jo Nesbø, Inspector Harry Hole of the Oslo Crime Squad is teetering on the edge; he is an alcoholic who is capable of slipping back into oblivion at any time.  He tries to stay sober one day at a time for the sake of eleven-year-old Oleg, who adores him, and Oleg's mother Rakel, whom Harry adores.  Although Rakel has moved on and is living with another man, Harry has never gotten over her.  Another reason to stay on the straight and narrow is his job.  Harry is a top-notch (some would say obsessive) investigator with special qualities:  boundless cynicism, dogged determination, keen insight, a vivid imagination, and an uncanny ability to read and understand a crime scene.  This time, Harry faces a case so horribly twisted that it just might be his undoing.<br /><br />Nesbø creates a bleak and unsettling mood.  There is a serial killer at large whose calling card is the snowman, normally an innocuous and playful figure that brings a smile to our faces.  The reasons for the perpetrator's actions will not become clear until much later.  In fact, Nesbø withholds key pieces of information and purposely leads us astray time and again.  Yet, the story is so electrifying that we cannot avert our attention, even if we wanted to.<br /><br />It is November 2004.  Forty-year old Hole is a tall man who has lost weight and appears haggard.  One reason for his disquiet is that he is, in some ways, similar to the felons he tracks down.  Harry is perfectly suited to a profession that involves \\"imprisoning people who were already imprisoned inside themselves.  Prisons of hatred and self-contempt he recognized all too well.\\"  Harry sleeps poorly, has recurring nightmares, and is closely acquainted with the darkest recesses of the human psyche.<br /><br />In this textured and complex thriller, Nesbø pits Harry against a sadistic antagonist who has little to lose and infinite patience.  Nothing can be taken for granted and no one can be trusted.  The characters are stunningly depicted, the plot is eerie and gut-wrenching, and an air of escalating menace permeates the narrative.  Harry's tortured mind is never at rest; even when he is sleeping, his subconscious mulls over details of the puzzle he is trying to solve.  In one symbolic scene, a workman is planning to clean out fungus from behind the walls of Harry's building.  The worker says, \\"That's the thing about mold.  You can't see it's there.\\"  The same can be said of people who pretend to be normal, but have a hidden side that is far from benign.  The decay that is rotting them from within may not become visible until it is too late. Jo Nesbø's \\"The Snowman\\" is one of the most compelling detective stories of the year, and its conclusion, one of the most thrilling in recent memory.plot is eerie and gut-wrenching, and an air of escalating menace permeates the narrative.

1416562591|5.0|Adigo uses a clever style of first person narrative to create a suspenseful and engaging story.  The main character's series of eMails to the Chinese Premier serve to set the background and setting for all that follows and includes a brief family history as well as a description of the conditions in modern India. This is a well written and revealing story of a possible way for a low caste Indian to escape his destiny. I hope that Adigo treats us to another story as engaging as this one.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Clearly, this \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" is not for purists.<br /><br />But for those with imaginations, it's great.<br /><br />The cast is beyond wonderful.  Everyone is precisely right for the role: the antic/rational Downey as Holmes, the sharper-than-you-thought Law as Watson, the surprising and physical McAdams as Adler, the always ominous Strong as Blackwood.  Even the minor characters, like Lestrade and Mary and the fortune-teller and the French giant are standouts.<br /><br />But it's really the plot and the direction that shine.<br /><br />The introduction of the occult is brilliant.<br /><br />And the intense physicality is superb.  Against the gray and brown dullness of the Edwardian backdrop, the characters' constant ACTION is like bright colors.  (The only other bright colors are, appropriately, on Rachel McAdams's wardrobe.)  These quite often erupt into real colors: the explosions, the pigs, the weapon of mass destruction, the flashing fire of electricity.<br /><br />Great fun.

B0044RUSZM|5.0|I ordered this for my Macbook Pro 15\\" to allow air circulation underneath. This computer gets very hot as other Macbook owners know. This stand helps a lot with this. It looks very nice on my desk as well. I read that some people didn't like the clear plastic connector, but I don't mind it at all. It came with little tabs to keep the computer from sliding off and they work great! Keep in mind though, if you are going to insert or eject a cd/dvd that the tabs sit right in front of the drive. Access to the unlatch button is great though.
B000000OAN|5.0|For a long time, I avoided Queen.  Aside from avidly listening to Bohemian Rhapsody the day Freddie Mercury died, and occasionaly listening to the first two Greatest Hits (ignore the third - not remotely comparable to the first two), I was put off by the brassy camp, the kitsch self-knowingness, a certain smarminess and not a small dose of synths in their 80s output.  Then something odd happened.    I downloaded a few of their rockier tracks on itunes - 'Dragon Attack', 'Brighton Rock' and so on - and one day realised that I actually rather liked what I heard.    Next, I listened to the album Jazz.  A strange album, Jazz.  At least, that is, when you're used to the rather more serious likes of Led Zep, Neil Young, and a raft of other 60s/70s big names.  It's first track, 'Mustapha' seemed just that little bit too absurd.  The later 'Let me entertain you' was just too clever.  I wondered if there was much else left once the humour evaporated...    So, I tried 'A Night at the Opera'.  Prior to recording it, Queen had been swindled by their previous manager and, with new management and a sense of throwing everything but the kitchen sink in, they recorded a masterpiece.  Like Jazz, this is a strange beast.  Stylistically, it veers all over the place.  Side One, goes from venomous and overblown hard rock to Ivor Novello-ish music hall to a sonic belter to a sweet love song with gorgeous harmonies to an echoey Graham Nash-like folky ditty to a somewhat generic hard rock no - that only really cuts loose to the end - to a frankly hilarious treat ('Seaside Rendezvous').  Side Two begins with a Townshend/Lloyd Webber-like rock opera, with a startling a capella interlude, then segues into very moving balladry, then moves to an homage to 1940s taste (ukeleles and jazz bands) then into Bohemian Rhapsody.  Finally, there's a guitar orchestra take on 'God save the Queen'.    I suppose the easiest comparison would be something like The Beatles' 'White Album'.  With Queen trailing The Beatles as the second most popular band in the UK ever (at least by sales), perhaps it's this ability to incorporate the many moods of life onto record that proves a hit with the British record buying public.      With that thought, I 'got' Queen.  Too unashamedly English (with all that the sense of humour entails), they could not sit contentedly as just another 70s cock-rock/glam rock band (for those of you not from the British Isles, perhaps the worst crime possible in the UK is lacking the British dry-to-mocking sense of humour and appearing just that liitle bit too sincere - hence why U2 and Coldplay have many haters in the UK).  Not to say that without Mercury, that could well have happened (witness the sometimes atrocious contributions of Roger Taylor).  In Mercury, they had the single most charismatic frontman in music history, but he also had perhaps the greatest range and tone of any rock singer (at least, by convention) and was a sensitive and original pianist.    Apparently, Brian May and Roger Taylor used to argue like brothers.  Mercury took a calming role and John Deacon avoided the fray.  I like to imagine the frantic efforts that went into 'Night at the Opera' - it took longer to record than any album prior to it.  Just think about that for a moment.  Consider the landmarks before it - 'Pet Sounds', 'Sgnt Peppers','Dark Side of the Moon'... it's quite a feat.  Not for Queen the turgid months that went into, say, Fleetwood Mac's (later) 'Tusk'. 'Opera' sounds taught and focused - even in the somewhat lengthy 'Prophet's song'.    So, to recap - buy this album.  If you can, buy it on vinyl - it looks and, in my view at least, sounds better on vinyl.  You get the originally desired package that way, the historical artifact.  It's a hoot, it's moving, it's stirring, it takes you to some strange places and brings you back home and slightly more spaced out.  And it made me like Queen, which is saying something.   Oh, and I really like 'Jazz' now, by theway.    Best tracks: I'm in love with my car, You're my best friend, Seaside Rendezvous, Love of my life, and Bohemian Rhapsody.

0307346617|4.0|This book was fun in that it gave a lot of points of view on the zombie story. In some ways, it was the best and worst part of the book. I liked the varied and multi-national story lines. It gave a great perspective on the plot and storyline. It also hurt it a bit to remember who was what. And the resolution wasn't as strong as the rest of the story. But better than most of the zombie drivel that passes for the genre today. Here's to hoping the author decides to home in on one story and make it as polished as this in his future works.    Fun aside: Loved the point about the root beer. Made the perspective of the enormity of the plot understandable. And made me question the next root beer I drank. Good work on that.
B002ZG99N6|4.0|Not quite in Denis Lehane territory,but following a good run of films set in Boston,The Departed,Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone(his own excellent previous effort in direction) Ben Affleck captures the realistic idiom,ground in a locality he himself grew up in and knows.His friend Matt Damon has distinguished himself as the leading actor of his day,Affleck has made some wrong choices,but started his own return to form in Hollywoodland.Now he is emerging as a superb director too,maybe his real forte as well as writing will crystallise here.     This suspenseful drama set in a crime thriller.Co-writing,directing and starring,Affleck pulls off an admirable heist movie,nodding to the realistic Wire TV series of gritty,well paced actioners,this is set in a notorious area of Boston,crime capital of America.Four lifelong friends and bank robbers,including Jeremy Renner as a wildcard, impulsive,loose-cannon,who overhits and is trigger-happy,carry out a bank robbery that involves hostage bank manager,Rebecca Hall.They wear skeleton masks(later nuns masks) in a nod to this convention.After she is freed     Doug McCray(Affleck)volunteers to keep tabs on her,to make sure she doesn't know anything about them.He finds love and he sees a ticket out of this way of life.This plot mechanism drives the film forward with McCray avoiding the FBI agent(Jon Hamm)looking to bring his crew down and his brother-in-crime Renner,who won't let him leave due to saving his life in the past,also criminal associates Peter Postlethwaite and co. who threatens to keep McCray in his father's way of life,responsible too for his mother's death.     There are some implausibilities and clichés,the one last job,the whore with the heart of gold,the shoot outs,the misty ending, the criminal who wants out,this is a great cast of good performances,including Chris Cooper as McCray's father,Jon Hamm,showing his worth as well as the phenomenal Renner.The climax to the film is a bit like Butch Cassidy,but the filmitself is gritty,with a well-paced,driving story,involving you in the characters,based on the novel by Chuck Hogan.Seek it out.
B0026P40NU|4.0|I enjoyed this film but it lacks substance.It doesn't even bother to mention why the group called themselves pre Raphealites.There is surpisingly little art shown in a film about artists,still it is very entertaining.
B000YAA68W|4.0|A real feisty film, more universal(and all the better) for being drawn. It would have lost universality if real people had been used.It's clear that in totalitarian regimes it's always the feminine comic spirit that is most subversive with its use of laughter and ridicule. The truth will out whatever ideology represses it. The drawings are based upon Satrapi's graphic novel where the personal is political.Autobiographical but not narcissistic which is it's real interest,with not a computer drawing in sight,but with the warmth and imperfection of the hand-drawn which will long outlast any computer graphic.     Real comic exuberance even with its treatment of an out-of-touch God who Marji berates. I liked that scene where she tells her Gran she is divorcing and the Gran defuses the emotion saying \\"I thought somebody had died\\". She goes to Vienna and Paris, witnessing nihilism,racism and the emptiness of 'love', returning home a more complex adult.The content-war and Islamic revolution-the biggest thing to happen since the fall of the Berlin wall (or even before it ) towards the end of the twentieth century-is what makes the story translated into such a graphic medium so amazing.Cartoon as the new documentary form as in Waltz with Bashir.In the spirit of Haroun and the sea  of stories,Salman Rushdie's novel.

031261246X|5.0|Just finished reading this and I'm itching to read more! Great story and the fact that it was written by someone as distinguished in the security field as Mark Russinovich is, made the technical details and plot lines that much more frightening. I thought it was a well-written cyber-thriller with good character development, exciting plot lines, and just enough technical detail to satisfy us geeks (but not so much that it alienates the casual reader).<br /><br />Reader be warned, if you have a hard time reading l337 sp3ak then you may need some help ([...]). I asked the author about this via Twitter ([...])and he said that was in there as a means to highlight that world but he will tone it down in the sequel ([...]).

1439102724|2.0|Someone close to Jodi Picoult should have been honest with her and said, \\"This isn't working. Start over.\\" I saw no redeeming value in this contrived, unrealistic scenario augmented by a throw every comment ever said about lesbians or homosexuals into the mix. I am not picking sides on the controversy. This is strictly about misplaced theme and development. There have been authors who reach a point in their careers where they just punch out book after book because they know their publishers will print them and their fans will buy them. I hope Jodi Picoult doesn't become one.  Oh, and the CD? Don't even bother.
B003EV6DBM|2.0|I'm a huge fan of the first four seasons (and I was never a fan of the traditional Dr. Who of the...well let's say previous century).  I was amazed at how the formula could stay intact through two doctors and several female companions.<br /><br />So I put the first disc of Season 5 into may computer with a mixture of dread and anticipation and ...fell asleep before the end of the episode (OK, I was a bit tired when I started and I did see most of it).<br /><br />The \\"production values\\" are there, but the endearing doctor is out.  He seems to be sort of an immature jerk, which actually could have worked and been a great idea if he had somehow teamed up with a strong female lead who could help with his character while he saved the universe every week.  That would have been a fun new take on an old formula.<br /><br />But this is the old formula just implemented badly in my opionion.  Maybe it just takes a few episodes for the new characters to gain their footing.  I've seen this happen in other series, and I know not to judge an entire series on the pilot, which the first episode with a new doctor sort of is.  I just cant bring myself to watch any more.  Maybe try to see an episode or two before you plunk down money and buy it.<br /><br />Update: So I decided to give it another chance and watched two more episodes.  In the third episode we find that the Daleks have infiltrated the British military during World War II (Battle of Britain to be precise).  To make a tedious story short, toward the end a Dalek mother ship appears above London and threatens to blow it up.  I thought to myself -- in Winston Churchill's voice -- that it's nothing a few Spitfires can't handle.  And then I see Spitfires attacking the Dalek ship.<br /><br />So, it come to this.  The stupidest dirction I can think of taking a story is now exactly what I see minutes later.  It's like it's been dumbed down and targeted at a different audience.<br /><br />My wife hasn't seen much of the earlier seasons, and I think I'd rather watch season (\\"series\\" for you across the pond) one again than continue with Dr. Whatever.ons, and I think I'd rather watch season (\\"series\\" for you across the pond) one again than continue with Dr. Whatever.

Because like Moore, he found the one role he was born to play - but sadly it will always be that 'one role' for all of film eternity. Certainly Moore has done other good things, '[[ASIN:B000E5N6KW The Sea Wolves]]' comes to mind. But there's no escaping the career defining character that he will be forever linked to - you know it without any prompting. And so goes the career of Jackman.<br /><br />Personally never found any of Jackman's performances, with the lone exception of '[[ASIN:B000LC55F2 The Prestige]]', of any worth or value. His acting has the emotional reach and agility of a tree sloth. Don't even ask about his freakish natural smile. Ugh. But as Wolverine - he absolutely rocks. You would be hard pressed to think of anyone besides him in the role of Mr. Berserker Fury. Pitch perfect, the true embodiment of Len Wein's vision.<br /><br />I'm actually a bit surprised and amused to read some reviews which comment on the comic-level characterizations and plot. Seriously? Some people actually thought this was going to be ... what...'The Godfather' in terms of depth of character and storyline?<br /><br />A fun-filled flick filled with decent-to-spectacular special effects. And a big thumbs up for Jackman's superlative, and always reliable, performance in his career vehicle.<br /><br />One last worthy note: Kevin Durand's Blob. I'm genuinely floored to see him take on this role. Until 'Origin', I could not imagine him doing anything other than big bad stud. So this was a real stretch of his acting muscles, so to speak. A repertoire enhancement for him. Kudos.superlative, and always reliable, performance in his career vehicle.    One last worthy note: Kevin Durand's Blob.

0307592839|4.0|Reading this book was a bit like reading a big Rolling Stone article.  It has interesting characters, interesting structure and is a bit of pop culture chronicle from the era of punk until present day.  The characters move in and out of cultural relevance.    It moves quickly, cuts back and forth between different times and places and switches characters rapidly.  It's a bit like a music video in that regard.  The characters are troubled and shallow yet Egan allows us into their deepest thoughts.    Several reviewers have mentioned the 70 page Powerpoint section of the book.  It's written by a young girl in present day and is a very interesting way to present her version of the story.    The novel is not so much a coherent story as it is a series of soundbites from certain points in the lives of the characters.  The music/cultural scene of the points in time told about are key parts of each story.    If you have nostalgia for the punk era of music then I think you'll be more likely to like this book.  If you're an older reader then you might not relate so much to the scene.    I found the rapid cuts to be reasonable but some people found this awkward and confusing.    I liked the book but suspect that it's not for everyone.
B002ZG98FU|5.0|I love Rachel McAdams, so when I saw the commercials for this movie, they had it trussed up like a chick flick.  Good news:  It's not, but it's also a great date movie.  I think you may actually be able to get your boyfriend to watch this one instead of \\"Blood 'n' Guts, Sequel 29.\\"<br /><br />Becky Fuller is looking forward to reshaping a tanking morning show, but has serious trouble when former news hotshot Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford) declares mutiny on doing anything lightweight, thus beginning an all-out war on the air with his co-host (Diane Keaton).<br /><br />The story is good, making you wonder if this is what really goes on behind the scenes at the Today Show, and is very good at mocking the insipid jokes they fake laugh at on the camera.  Diane Keaton and Ford play off each other so well as enraged egomaniacs, but McAdams and Ford have a solid chemistry that makes you feel they've known each other forever.  The romantic sparks between her character and Patrick Wilson are virtually nonexistent, but the nice thing is that it's mostly on the backburner throughout the film, only accentuating Becky's frenzied workaholism.  Smart move on the director's part.<br /><br />Let's face it, though:  Harrison Ford plays Mike Pomeroy so well and so comfortably, that he is truly the indisputable star of the flick.  His sarcastic one-liners and curmudgeonly conduct are so laugh-out-loud funny that you end up liking Pomeroy instead of wanting to choke him!  Ford steals every single scene he's in from our beautiful top-billed star, but that's not a bad thing.  It is a great vehicle for them both, and each actor's generations can be brought together through this project, but I have already liked both for some time now.  Also of note:  Jeff Goldblum's scenes are not plentiful, but he's got some very funny lines as well.<br /><br />Good story, great cast, and not the typical comedy that's out there.  Not so romantic, but it still works on levels that won't make you feel like a schmuck for getting into it.  That's why it is a great movie wether you are dating or not.  Simply enjoyable and fresh, let's see more directors pull pleasant surprises out of their hats like this one.  This movie was thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end.That's why it is a great movie wether you are dating or not.

B004LUHQ1G|4.0|Did anyone else cream when Krist Novoselic walked in the room to lay down the bass for \\"I Should Have Known\\"?     I was watching the documentary Back and Forth and there's a part towards the end where they're in Dave's garage working on this album and this guy walk in...    I'm thinking to myself who is that? And as he gets closer to the camera I'm like NO FREAKING WAY!    I would give the album 5 stars just for bring back Krist and having all the ex members of Nirvana in one recording space for the first time in years...but the music has to be judged on its own merit    Let's start at the beginning. The first time I heard the first single \\"Rope\\" on the radio I wasn't overly impressed. It's not (for me) one of those songs that is an instant classic.   Some past Foo Fighters song have been instant classics and you could tell that from the first listen.  Such as: Times Like These, The Pretender, All My Life, etc.     But the bad thing about a song that is instantly way too appealing is that over time it becomes played out even faster than it would have otherwise. That's not the case with \\"Rope\\". The more I listen to it the more I like it...the more I realize why this guitar part is here and that guitar part there and so on    While the album may not be as instantly appealing as some of their past work....you have to understand that the guys are getting back to garage band basics. The hooks are there but they are cleverly layered and sometimes almost seemingly hidden in the rock barrage that the band throws out there    Upon first listen of the album, you might say \\"Where is the melody?\\" on a few tracks...but then you listen a few times and you're like there it is...and by then you're sucked in to it    I understand a lot of kids growing up nowadays and they know who the Foo Fighters are but they don't really know who Nirvana was. I think its cool that Dave has opened up about some things and embraced his past in a way that it seems like he never has before. No longeris he trying to get out of the shadow of that band...a lot of kids don't even know who Nirvana was! Maybe they need a history lesson on grunge...I dunno...but I'm loving every second of it    I knew I was going to buy this album when I was watching the documentary and Pat was laying down some guitar parts for the album. He asked Dave jokingly \\"Is that too Grunge for you?\\" which Dave responded to by saying \\"It can never be too grunge.\\" I'm so glad those two think on the same wavelengths that I do :) Bringing Pat back was the best idea Dave has had in a long time    Now they just need to bring back Krist for even more songs next time! Maybe even for a one-off album with Pat featuring Dave as the drummer and vocalist! Probably never happen this side of heaven but one can dream    The Foo Fighters have become one of the biggest rock bands in the world, but still humble enough to make an album in a garage. These guys know where its at. First Foo album I've bought in a long time...highly recommended
B004EI2NM2|1.0|I never thought I could be so bored watching two naked ladies, but I was.  I couldn't even make it half way through before I removed the DVD and threw it into the garbage.  This is just a chick-flick for lesbians, because no guys could possibly be interested in the endless dialogue about nothing.  These girls just drone on and on about nothing in particular, most of which is just them telling lies.  I guess the fact that they are naked for 99% of the time is supposed to keep you tuned in.  But like they said on Seinfeld: \\"There's good naked, and there's bad naked.\\"  Well, let me tell you, this was \\"bad naked.\\"  No stars for you!  (Yes, I know, it shows that I gave it one star.  But this is because Amazon forced me to.)
B004LWZW24|4.0|Despite several implausible gimmicks in the script about astral flights<br />into The Further, INSIDIOUS does the job of keeping the viewer glued to<br />the screen as the shocking incidents begin to pile up before the<br />surprise ending delivers a final revelation. Patrick Wilson's performance<br />gives nothing away with regard to the film's last bit of shock value.<br />He's simply the husband who can't believe all he's expected to deal<br />with when Lin Shaye shows up to rid the family of its cursed monster.<br /><br />One of the more obvious effects is the stark use of music for shock<br />impact, but used in connection with what's happening on screen it does<br />manage to deepen the sense of explosive terror. Leigh Whannell's clever<br />script fairs better in the story's first half up until the arrival of a<br />team of specialists--but it's then that the horror elements reach their<br />peak.<br /><br />***** POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD*****<br /><br />It's just that the astral aspects of out of body experience don't carry<br />much weight in the way of credibility and the voyage into darkness<br />toward the last fifteen minutes is a bit over the top by the time it's<br />over.<br /><br />Acting-wise, it's fine with good work from Wilson, Rose Byrne, and Ty<br />Simpkins--but it's Lin Shaye whom you'll ultimately remember in a very<br />intense and believable performance.<br /><br />For thriller fans, this is not the blood and gore type of thing some<br />may be expecting--but an intelligent thriller that plays its mind games<br />with the viewer in a fascinating way. It's handsomely produced and<br />shows no strain from its more modest budget limitations. I found it an<br />extremely effective thriller.<br /><br />Warning: You'll only be able to enjoy the second half of the film if<br />you're willing to accept the startling premise of The Further.
B000062Y98|5.0|So I ordered this CD a while back from westcoastmetal and was excited to see a package arrive. When I opened it, it turned out to be a different Blind Guardian CD. I contacted the seller about it and asked if i could exchange it and he let me keep it for my troubles plus sent me the correct CD a few days later. Both came extremely quickly and in the condition promised. Definitely look forward to buying more from here.
B004MKM8L8|1.0|I pre-ordered this movie a day or so before it came out with the understanding that I wouldn't get it the day it was released.  However, today, a few days after I placed the order, I received an email from Amazon bumping the ship date out even farther than they originally stated.  No big deal, I figured I'd just cancel the order and buy the movie somewhere else.  However, when I go to my Amazon account I can't cancel the order because it is being prepared for shipping.  If they were going to move the ship date they should have at least left me the option to cancel the order.  Huge dissapointment; I will never pre-order through Amazon again.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I got the G930's yesterday and they blew me away. Sound is tight and deep, 7.1 sounds great, and the quality of manufacturing is superb (they have sufficient weight to them that they shouldn't randomly break). The wireless and voice distortion drivers are just icing on the cake.    Sound Quality, 4 of 5 stars - Not quite the full-bodied bass you can get from Bose headphones, but barely anything less (.5 off). The lack of advanced equalizer presets was also a bummer, as it's easier to leave it alone than go research on the web what each of the ten sliders should be at (.5 off).    Microphone Quality, 4 of 5 - Good overall, better than my cell phone.    Noise isolation, 3 of 5 - These are natural (passive) noise-canceling headphones, as far as I can tell. For not using an active signal to block incoming noise, they perform very well. They also won't give you a splitting headache after hours of use, which is a plus to me. Some people will expect the same performance as Bose's $300 headphones, but you won't find that here (and should not be a major selling point either).     Range, 4 of 5 - As I mentioned in the first category, sound is excellent. The high range pops well, the mid range is mellow and full, and bass has some decent kick. I just wanted a little bit extra fullness from the bass, but that is barely distracting.    Style, 5 of 5 - This is very subjective, but I like it. The wireless is great, the pulldown boom mic works well, and the glossy black works with the matte black and the red accents. Leather ear cups are a nice touch too.    Durability, 5 of 5 - They feel heavy enough that they shouldn't break (like a pair of the cheaper Bose headphones did on me).     Fitment, 4 of 5 - Different for each person, but my head is rather average sized (in the military I wore a M helmet; L just for extra protection) and even on the smallest setting, there was space between my head and the head band.      Summary:    Pros: Great sound, wireless, good quality, sexy.  Cons: Bass is a smidge less powerful than I thought it should be, not active noise canceling, no equalizer presets.    Bottom line: Would buy again!
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|As usual Clint Eastwood has put together a thought provoking story about three people and their ultimate connections, and as he himself has said, \\"the story is the thing\\".  No gimmicky action (apart from the tsunami) and his usual lovely soft background music make his films about that story, and he tells it so well.  May he continue!  I love everything he does -
B003XKPPOU|5.0|When it comes to family entertainment, nobody beats Disney-Pixar. This movie is no exception. My wife and I enjoy it as much as our 3-year-old daughter. We watch this movie, on average since getting it, about three times a week. The toys and stories about playtime and adventures are enough to keep our daughter raptly attentive; the deeper stories about coming-of-age, separation anxiety, and finding your way in the world are well written and acted out for the adults. Some parts are a little darker than the first two movies and may elicit questions from older children, but all-in-all it's a fun and exciting movie.<br /><br />Needless to say, the blu-ray picture and sound are amazing. The amount of extras is impressive; you'll need to watch the extras on both the blu-ray disk and the dvd since they aren't (like with some packages) just repeats of the other disk.<br /><br />In the end, everyone ends up getting just what they need, even if they didn't realize earlier that it was what they wanted.<br /><br />This is, in my opinion, the perfect way to end the Toy Story series. (SPOILER ALERT!) The toys are still together and have someone who will love them and play with them; Andy is grown up and, while past the point of being able to love the toys, has fond memories of his time with them. Lotso gets his due and the other toys at SunnySide Day Care are free to live without the fear of his gang of thugs (who, it turns out, aren't that bad once the dictator is gone).<br /><br />I know it's a profitable franchise and an enjoyable series of good, wholesome family movies...but I hope the studio will realize that they've attained perfection with these three movies and not drive it into the ground by releasing additional movies just for the sake of making more money. The toys are happy, Andy is happy, and I am happy...let's stop there.
0802473156|5.0|The premise of this book rings true to experience.  It is good to get a grip on the 5 Love Languages.  Even though people generally have one primary love language, it is good to practice them all.  I like the suggestions this book has for how to implement each language.  The 5 Love Languages web site was additionally helpful with the option for taking the online quiz to determine your love language or even you child's or teen's.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|After watching Tina Fey for years, it's obvious that she's a comedic virtuoso. Since she was an SNL head writer, then started producing and writing a multi Emmy award winning sitcom, it should be no surprise that she's a very funny author, too. What is surprising is the breadth of this book. Fey deftly juggles essays about growing up, working, being a mom, writing, and being a boss. Her brilliant sense of humor is front and center, but she also manages to make serious points and comment on issues important to her. It all just works together.<br /><br />Bossypants veers from silly to pithy to tragic to hilarious to thoughtful, feminist to nerdy, around and around again. It keeps the reader entertained and thinking at the same time, and that is Fey's genius at work. She wields insightful commentary and fart jokes with equal aplomb. It's a delight to read, frequently surprising and always amusing. I can't recommend this book enough, for both women and men. If you can't find something to laugh at in this book, you are a robot.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|I'll keep this short by simply stating that I've been a Rush fan since the late 70s and I believe this is a Blu-Ray that any Rush fan with an interest in the personal side of the band will appreciate greatly. The stellar HD picture quality makes the movie that much more enjoyable. Beyond the Lighted Stage actually exceeded my expectations!
0618918248|2.0|I could easily write a similar book. It could be titled \\"The Mother Delusion\\". I would give example after example of terrible mothers through history. Ancient Greek plays even had mothers who murdered their children. Susan Smith was no shining example of loving parenthood. In every community, everywhere, there are mothers who abuse, neglect and even kill their kids. After describing all these examples, I would convincingly argue that because mothers are evil, all children should be removed at birth to be raised by robots.  The concept would be laughable.   This author does the same thing with religion. Nothing good ever done in the name of religion is mentioned. No statistic that believers may have something good result from their belief is even considered. Where are the statistics about why a huge majority of the population foolishly and doggedly persist in a belief in God? Do they get something positive from this or are they all simply ignorant and seeking misery? Where are the IQ tests and data about how unhappy believers are? As a \\"scientist\\" where is his objective evidence? If religion is so harmful it cannot be hard to prove-more criminals should be believers, more suicides should be believers,all the stats should be easily found.   He resorts essentially to arguments that if a religious person or persons did something despicable, then the religion is worthless. Would any Nation, or human Institution survive by that standard? The US once had legal slavery, there have been judges bribed, there have been abusive police or soldiers, etc.  I view his \\"reasoning\\" as cheap shots taken in anger with his hatred shining through. He is no theologian or philosopher and the fact that this book is popular highlights a lack of critical thinking. This type of mindless attack is what substitutes for reasoned discourse in politics and sadly, in this book.
B0047Y17P2|2.0|I bought this book because I enjoyed The Lincoln Lawyer by the same author.  This one was fun and easy to read but without giving too much away, I just couldn't believe the surprise ending.  One question was answered, but there were others that the author just ignored.  It stays in my mind and bothers me.  I wonder if I'm the only one who didn't like the ending.

B004HW7JMO|5.0|There is little to say in historic value and a good story, these elements are not present.  But in terms of action there is plenty to say.  The battles and specially the hero Gannicus are reason enough to watch.  There is plenty much blood than in Spartacus the Original Miniseries, the gladiatorial fights are so much better choreographed and try to keep true to history as gladiators classes are designated portrayed as Murmillo, Thraex, Homoplachus and Retiarius as were in real life.  The last fight at the Capua amphitheater inaugural games is so well done and so riveting, you find yourself also chanting Gannicus!! Gannicus !! for the victor of the games.  These Scene was done with bravura and in my perspective takes away all the faults of the series.
B001TODOCM|4.0|this was an enjoyable book for the most part throughout, especially for someone who loves books! i was just a bit annoyed by the ending, it seemed kind of hokey when the book overall had been on a bit of a higher level. i haven't seen the movie based on this book so i'll have to watch it now and see how it compares.

I will not give up on Jodi though.  I just would not recommend this book to new readers.
0312370849|4.0|overall a great read. stick with it if you're like me and it was a bit of a slow start, the pacing really picks up and then you can't put it down! i won't say much about the story here as i don't want to give anything away but it really is an amazing and haunting book. you really get into both story lines and the writing makes you feel like you're right there w/the characters experiencing it all.
0061438294|4.0|I bought this book to help me read people better in my business dealings in the sales industry. The author has obviously had extesive experience reading people during his career in the FBI, and he gives many colorful law enforcement oriented examples of how reading body language has helped him solve problems. There are many illustrative pictures throughout the book, and the author has drawn on a wide bibliography of other related books to augment his own experience. My only complaint is that the examples and anecdotes this book seem to be aimed mainly at law enforcement personnel rather than business professionals. I would like to see Joe Navarro partner with a business negotiation specialist or sales professional to write a \\"Body Language for the Business Professional\\" type of book; much like he has done with Phil Hellmuth for his poker-oriented body language manual. It would also be nice if he took the examples one step further to explain what a good course of action would be when confronted with various business/sales scenarios were a person's body language indicates distress, surprise, deception, etc...
0143034901|5.0|First off WOW!! I was pretty much hooked from the first sentence of this book! For a book lover like myself what could be better than a book starting out by the main character visiting something called The Cemetery of Forgotten Books?<br /><br />Right from the start the story is both enchanting and intriguing and impossible to put down!! This book literally has it all; intrigue, action, love story, history, intense love of books, really too much to try and summarize in a review!<br /><br />Basically anyone and everyone who considers themselves a lover of books should go out and find this book immediately!! This is by far the best book I've read in months and I want everyone I know to read this book and be as enthralled and gripped by this book as I was!<br /><br />TOTALLY AWESOME BOOK, BEST BOOK I'VE READ IN MONTHS!!!! EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK, READ WHAT I READ ABOVE AND JUST GO OUT AND GET IT, THIS BOOK HAS IT ALL!!!!!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Wow, I really loved this book.  The title of the book drew my interest, but I still wasn't sure.  Then at work, one of our guests was reading the second novel and I asked her about it and she told me she LOVED it.  The only thing I was dissappointed about was at the end of the book, where they have information about the author, it stated the author passed away after writing the three books.  I was seriously dissappointed because I was looking forward to many, many books from Mr. Stieg Larsson.  It makes this trilogy a little bittersweet, but delectable as well.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Pretty fun game ... different modes, challenges, etc. Gets a little boring once you've beaten it ... but what game doesn't. Overall, pretty well made, fun to play (at least for a little while), &amp; fairly priced.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book but I guess I didn't read the review or summary of the book very well.  It really wan't what I expected.  It was a good read,  but when I was finished, \\" I was kind of like, what was the point?\\" It seemed like the whole book, while filled with very interesting information, explained how people that are incredibly sucessful were either born at the right time or came from the right family, etc. Chapter after chapter the book spelled out that anyone who is a true outlier, didn't necessarily achieve it with just thier gift, they had to be born at the right time or come from a certain family, or be in the right place. I kept thinking that at some point that all this data and statistics were going to be useful for applying to my personal self, but that was never the case. I didn't find the book inspirational, but at the same time, it kept my attention to the very end.

B004R13U6Y|2.0|ezPDF Reader is a well-laid-out, fast program for reading PDFs.  If it worked correctly as it was designed, it would be worth five stars.  However, two big problems stood in the way of my use.    First, I couldn't find a way to zoom in or out on a page.  While not a major issue, this was annoying.    Second, and more significantly, the process of turning pages was simply broken.  Sometimes, tapping or flicking would do nothing.  Sometimes, it would turn two pages.  It never turned one page at a time.  When using my Xoom to demonstrate a PDF for friends, the program simply failed to work as I needed it to, to the point where I finally gave up, opened Aldiko, and went to the relevant part of the PDF in that.  ezPDF Reader was faster than Aldiko, and if working right would have provided a better PDF experience - I'm still looking for a good one, because Aldiko is so slow - but ultimately it just broke down.  I would not recommend the use of this program until it sees fixes.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Rating: PG-13 - contains some strong language, and some sensuality.<br /><br />Overview:<br /><br />This movie covers the story of the creation the Facebook web site. The Screenplay is simply brilliant as it takes you the various hearings that Mark Zuckerberg had to attend, firstly for his exploits at Facemash, and then with the Winklevoss Twins and also with his former best friend, Eduardo Saverin.<br /><br />Background:<br /><br />This movie is based on the book: The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal (2009) by Ben Mezrich. Both Zuckerberg and Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake) strongly challenge the accuracy events portrayed in the film. While the overall concepts may have some truth to them, they have been embellished so as to make it more exciting and entertaining. Everything unfolded in a much more mundane manner.<br /><br />Zuckerberg:<br /><br />There is no doubt that Mark Zuckerberg is a genius, while in Middle school his father taught him Atari Basic programming and as he progressed, a private tutor was hired to assist in his development. Zuckerberg has listed as non-English languages he could read and write: French, Hebrew, Latin, and ancient Greek. He is also skilled at fencing.<br /><br />Value of an Idea:<br /><br />For me the value of this film is that it shows what is possible when a person's talents are identified at an early age and properly channeled. In my opinion, Mark's father is the real hero here, for doing just that for Mark.

B0043ISH6O|4.0|This CD has 19 tracks. My favorite is track 5: Intriguing Possibilities. Overall the first 6 tracks are the best of the lot. The other 13 tracks are OK IMHO. It is a nice collection overall.<br /><br />What is so sweet about these tracks is the way the traditional piano is mixed with the electronic sounds, very original.<br /><br />I was hoping that the song used in the Trailer (you can check it out on YouTube) for this movie would have been included in this CD, unforunately it was not. I think that this track would have capped off this CD quite nicely.<br /><br />This sound track obtained a Golden Glode award. Congrats.

B002KSPKRS|3.0|I bought this a while back and the price has not dropped at all. The sound quality is good, it could be a bit better though, when the bass gets high in a game, it creates too much static and crackling noises but I can't expect much from a wireless headset. The one thing I hate is that it is made so cheaply for the price. I mostly use it for movies anyways and I connect my analog headset to the base when playing games, I feel like the sound quality improves a lot when connected directly. Also, there is no need for 7.1 on a gaming headset because there are no games out so far that provide 7.1 surround sound. It eats up the batteries really fast too, I've had to change them every few days or so. It's still a good headset though and great for online gaming but definitely NOT worth the price tag.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have sold these and bought the Astro a40 headset and I cannot believe the improvement. This headset was nothing compared to the Astro's. I have no idea why I was using such a crappy headset to begin with. I would definitely go for the Asto a40 instead of these. Same price, much better quality!! I am just staying away from wireless headsets overall. I have noticed that the quality is degraded when using a wireless headset compared to a wired one.
1400097029|3.0|The Sea is a 200 page prose-poem. The writing is beautiful throughout, but nothing happens. Some reminiscing about his recently deceased wife, though we learn little about her, mixed with memories of the narrator's childhood tragedy  at the same location. In between, we get pages upon pages of description of the color of the sea, sky, and skin of the other boarders in the lodging house.  It's hard to fault such beautiful writing, but if you like plot and character to go along with description, this is not a book for you.

B001NEK2GE|4.0|Overall, this was a good purchase.  Simple to use, and with a lot of versatility, it allows me to do things with my MMORPG that I never could before.  In a highly competitive PVP game like DAOC, speed is key.  This product gives me the speed and agility of a console game.  A couple of points could use some improvement, though.  The thumbstick button requires more pressure than is optimal.  The software seems clunky, like it's using up more resources than I would expect just to run simple macros.  Stability has been a slight issue; my system crashed and rebooted a couple times when I had it running alongside the game and iTunes simultaneously, though my computer had never crashed before.  Still, thumbs up.  It's been stable at least since I stopped running iTunes simultaneously, and I've been dying less and winning more battles.  A lot more.
B004GYY714|5.0|The number of stations available from all over the world is incredible. You literally have so many choices that you will have the world at your fingertips.  The ability to use presets is a plus.  If you like music this is the app to get!!
0765350386|5.0|Maybe I'm just a picky reader, but I don't tend to give many 5 star reviews. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I enjoyed the use of metals as an integral part of the magic system. Vin came off as a believable, if somewhat predictable, heroine. Most fantasy stories have their down-and-out characters who prove to be made of much more than they seem, the \\"chosen one\\" if you will. This book is no different, but the world is as impressive as it is dark and depressing.<br /><br />You can look as deeply as you like into the politics of the book, you'll probably bore yourself. However, as a tale all about taking down the evil empire and it's god-like Lord Ruler, this book is awesome.<br /><br />The writing style didn't bother me at all. The dialogue seemed decent as well. The plotting was good... it even a twist or two that worked. The characters do change a little... perhaps not enough to please some but enough to keep them interesting. It's a worthwhile series to invest yourself in.

0670022411|5.0|I loved this book and can't wait for the next installment in the trilogy! It has spurred me to research some of the books named in it. I don't like that I have to wait a year (or more) for the sequel, but anticipate it will be worth it.
0061980269|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is a classic.  I hadn't read it since high school many years ago.  I decided to treat myself to the 50th anniversary large type edition.  The Harper Luxe edition is a trade paperback.  It's just lovely.  I enjoyed reading this edition even more then when I originally read it 48 years ago.

1423142659|5.0|I do really love Percy's series.  Reading this one made me miss Percy & Friends a lot,   but I also fall in love with Leo too (laugh) He is so funny and lovely!  Can't wait for book 2 this October!
B003VANOFY|5.0|Way back in 2002 when surround sound on computers meant quadraphonic, and Zalman was just getting founded as a company: I created a pair of DIY surround sound gaming headphones by modifying a pair AKG 280 headphones.  Since that day I have only played games using surround sound headphones of one sort or another.    For the past few years I have used a pair of Turtle Beach HPA2 headphones. They have worked well, and still sound great to this day, except they are simply falling apart from use. I was a bit hesitant to give up my XFI sound card for a USB version of audio, but so far have had no issues. I was also apprehensive about giving up a set of heaphones with 8 individual speakers to one with just two, and Dolby headphone processing.    I bought the wired version of the Logitech 7.1 headphones, but returned them when I found the wireless pair weighed almost the same, and weren't much more expensive. I have been using them for a few weeks now, mostly playing Left4Dead2, watching movies, and listening to music.    First, the actual audible sound quality. Near perfect in my opinion. The audio is balanced and detailed, the bass doesn't overdrive the rest of the tones, and the mid-range isn't muddy. The multi-band EQ is a great touch that the wired version didn't have, and is great for music, but I didn't find myself enabling it in games.    Surround sound quality: Great. The \\"feel\\" of the surround sound is amazing, as far as the ability to detect where and how far a sound is coming from. In Left4Dead2 I can call out \\"smoker at three o-clock\\" or \\"charger behind us\\" without even looking. The only time the positioning seems to get a bit muddy is if something is RIGHT behind you, in which case it sort of sounds like \\"dead center\\" instead of \\"behind center\\". The surround sound even does pretty good with music, but I find myself turning it off for that. What is nice is changing between surround sound and stereo is a simple hard switch on the headphones, no need to open up aconfiguration application.    Microphone sound quality: Also great. The microphone is top-notch. You can turn on the voice repeat feature and hear it for your self. There are two issues with the microphone though. First, the mic does pick up a lot of outside sounds when your NOT talking. It picks up the smallest mouse click in a quiet room. It does however seem to compensate for loud rooms. At a LAN party it didn't pick up everything and only seemed to pick up voices, however not always my own voice. Second, even if the \\"side channel\\" sound some sound from the microphone is always fed back into the headphone signal. Even if you press the mute button on the headphones, if you scratch the surface of the mic you can head it in the audio. And it's and electrical connection too, not a vibration traveling up the headset. It does turn off entirely when the mic is \\"docked\\" at the top of the headset. Perhaps Logitech added this so you could hear yourself?     Noise isolation: The ear muffs on these are very good at cutting out outside noise. In fact I think Logitech put in the side channel control just so you could head someone nearby talk. This is great at a LAN party where you want to hear the game, but also bad when say someone is trying to get your attention.    Comfort: Despite being HUGE, and fairly heavy, the headphones are very comfortable, and I can wear them for hours besides one issue: They push on the arms of my glasses. Which many headphones do, but due to the noise isolation foam being pretty strong, it can start to wear on me.    Battery life: So far I have been able to game for many hours or more on the headphones with no issue, I never measured the exact amount. The manual says it will warn you before they stop working, however the one time I did run them to zero the warning was only seconds before they shut down. But since you can just plug in the USB and keep playing while charging, this really isn't an issue. They are wireless headphones 99% of the time.The do seem to take a few hours to charge. The software keeps a good readout of exactly how much battery you have left, and I often keep it open on a second monitor. The charging cord is long enough to work as a headphone cord.    Range: I was able to walk to the kitchen and get a drink without loosing audio., about 150ft and though four walls.    Cons and improvements:  -Side buttons could do a lot more. You can get some plugins but they have to be hard-coded and aren't very flexible.  -There is no real quick way to switch between USB audio for the headphones, and on-board audio for my speakers. I used a shortcut program and the side buttons to switch between them, but there could be a more elegant solution. For example, I would like it if I actually power off the headphones, the Logitech program could detect it and switch back to my secondary preferred sound output.  -More warning about impending battery failure would be great. When mine failed it was in the middle of a gauntlet event where I had zero time to find my charger cable. I had to finish the game without sound.  -An indicator when you have the voice changing enabled (perhaps blink the mic LED). Its a fun feature, but not when you get into a serious game and forgot you left it on, and five minutes in someone asks if your mic is broken.  -Remove the microphone audio entirely from the headphone sound.  -Provide a always-on setting. The number one complaint I see is from people who didn't have audio playing for 15 minutes, and then tried to play audio only to realize the headphones turned off automatically. Battery saving is great, but perhaps if the mic arm is down the headphones could stay on constantly?
B003QNXPUK|4.0|I have had many zagg inivisble shields for my iphone 3g only because i mess up putting on the shield, but when i manage to get it right, the outcome is great. And that is the same with the iphone 4 model. Before installing i watched on youtube how to do it...    1) Spray fingers  2) Spray both sides of sheild  3) Apply sticky side that is sprayed to phone it is amazingly easy to slide the shield to where you need it  4) Squeeze out any bubble and spray left behind  5) Let the cover cure for maybe 5 hours (24 is not needed)  6) Use phone!    I don't understand why people say there is friction, that is for all protectors, but after a few ours of use or so the screen no longer feels like its there (except when pressing the home button. But regardless i LOVE this cover, no scratches, ADDS GRIP, and i'm not afraid to just leave my phone laying face down.    The only downfall is that i could not use this with my belkin grip vue or any other cover that has a lay on the table design, BUT, if you really look at the corners and sides, there is actually space maybe a millimeter or so for EACH side that should allow that, i noticed that i did go a little too much on the left side, which is the side that bubbles with my case. And for that i give it 4 stars, but still is a great product.    Smooth  Clear  Easy to put on  Scratchproof  Aligns PERFECT      GREAT PRODUCT!
0670022411|5.0|I could hardly put this book down long enough to get some sleep.  I work very long hours and don't get much reading time so have to cut into sleep time.  The first night I was reading, it was 4:00 a.m. when I put it down to get 2 hrs of sleep.  The book is wonderful.  I was in love with the vampire from the gitgo, and I had no trouble putting myself in the witch's place.  No shallow characters here.  Even the ones you hate - you know why  you hate them.  And then there is time travel - that was the only question in my mind as to how they avoided meeting themselves when they went back to the same place and time.  I commend the author on her very extensive research.  It was all so totally believable.  One of my favorite things is the sentient house who is also clairvoyant apparently as it lets the owners know someone is coming by adding another room.  Now that I have completed my one week marathon of reading this book, I plan to go back and read it again so I can soak up all the details.  Can hardly wait for the second in the series to come out, but sorry I have to wait a whole year.  Although with all the research that went into this one, I can see why we have to wait a year.

B004SBQAN8|3.0|No gory violence, constant swearing, awkward sex scenes made it a good choice for movie night with our two teenage boys. In that way, the movie was worth watching. It started off good, lagged for about half an hour or so, then ended well.<br /><br />The film is sci-fi action with decent special effects and acting. It is about a teen with superpowers, John Smith played by Alex Pettyfer, who is one of nine original survivors from another planet. The first three have been killed by aliens who want to take over Earth and John is next; his guardian warrior Henri, wonderfully played by the gorgeous Timothy Olyphant, whisks him from place to place once routinely as his cover is blown.<br /><br />In his new town and identity, he meets Sarah, played by Dianna Agron, and becomes serious about her. I felt the romance thing was not really credible since John is told repeatedly by Henri to stay under the radar but within two days, he has the hots for the former girlfriend of the school bully. I found Sarah boring but I did like the guy who played the high school bully (and also quarterback of the football team and son of the sheriff). I also liked the 'science nerd' Sam who John befriends.<br /><br />Not worth watching unless you are looking for a family movie. Just assure your teens, if they are boys, that the romance stuff won't go on too long and there are good special effects and action for most of the movie.
0307473473|5.0|I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with this the first novel in the series.  I'd had it recommended by two friends and knew nothing about it, but had to read just off of their recommendation.  I normally don't like mysteries, but this one certainly had me interested from the beginning.<br /><br />There were several contributing factors that made this novel stand out, made it something that easily draws the reader in.  The first is that I really didn't know who had done it.  You try and guess and then something new comes up and you change your mind until eventually I had no clue who the murderer was.  This is a huge plus in my book because it kept me interested.  I did have an inkling of a certain part of the plot and ending (don't want to spoil anything) but that, to me, was a side plot that actually enhanced the story and its appeal.<br /><br />The other major aspect that I liked was of course the character development with Lisbeth and Mikael.  Lisbeth, especially, did and said stuff that really enhanced her character's personality.  You are drawn in to like her despite her anti social view on life, her awkwardness, her blunt and sometimes rude personality.  Of course bad stuff happened to her in order for her to respond, but it none the less made her the most interesting character in the whole book (despite not really, comparatively, seeing as much of her as, say, Mikael).<br /><br />I eagerly read through the book and couldn't wait to pick it up again.  Not the best book I've ever read, but certainly one that I will remember and recommend to others.<br /><br />4.5 stars.
B004J00QLU|1.0|when your on your personal computer at home do you just open task manager and randomly start closing running processes? don't think so...these apps is silly and is hard on your hardware when most processes required on the phone a forced to cold start every time you hit the magic button. Educate yourselves before using apps that are just to good to be true. battery life is bad no matter what and running yet another program constantly to save battery life...that just doesent make sense...you want better battery life buy an extended battery and use android 2.3...STOP PUTING THIS TRASH ON YOUR PHONES...zero stars if I could..
B003UESJ9W|2.0|The first twenty five minutes of \\"Country Strong\\" are really good. Then it gets very slow and finally descends into clich&eacute; \\"Star is Born\\" territory. It's a shame too, because Gwyneth Paltrow is very good in her role, and the scenes with music are great, but few and far between. Watch \\"Nashville\\" instead.
B00004THAY|5.0|I LOVE this CD.  The interplay between Clapton & BB King is wonderful -- different voices, different guitar styles, yet the overall effect is classic blues.
0975991477|1.0|I believe there is something unethical about using the book format as an advertisement.  On TV, I know when I'm watching a commercial, and have the option to turn it off.  But spending countless hours with a book, only to find out it says nothing new, AND leaves out the punch-line (the how to...), that's disheartening and infuriating.<br />I'm not downgrading the author's beliefs, I happen to share them.  But I had them before reading the book, and learned nothing new.  There was no reason to write this book other than to promote Psych-K.  Gee, thanks Bruce Lipton.  At least I borrowed the book, and didn't spend money on it.
B002ZG981E|2.0|Maybe it was better in the theatre but I thought Inception wasnt any better or worse than any other mind binder type of movie
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I love this show, it is one of those shows that keeps me recording it on my DVR or rushing home just to watch it the night a new episode comes out.  You may think that this is aimed towards the high school or younger generation, but really, I think it's appropriate for all age groups-- granted it's PG13, so maybe no one younger than middle school would get this show.  But, I'm in college and it still kept me interested.<br /><br />The plot is pretty different than what they have on TV now a days, you have definitely not watched another show like it.  From the fashion, to the actors/actresses, you will find something to love-- which will definitely keep you flying through the whole season.  And I'm even going to buy the complete first season even after watching the whole thing on TV.<br /><br />I loved it so much that I even went out and bought the entire series of books because I wanted to find out what happens right away-- warning though, the TV version is a bit different on many aspects than the book series.  Some characters were used for different purposes in the TV series to make it more drama compelling and drawn to the audience.<br /><br />It's funny, scary at times, a good thriller for everyone!  I definitely would recommend this TV show :)
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I loved this album from the start... the first song and first time listening through. After listening a few more times, the songs that stick the most with me are 'Bridge Burning' (can't think of a better song to open an album), 'Dear Rosemary' (Bob Mould's track - reminds me of Sugar more than Husker Du), 'White Limo' (crazy loud rockin' song), 'I Should Have Known' (signature Foo poignant/anthemic rock song) and 'Walk'.  As another reviewer said, this music makes me feel like ME.  I only hope Dave and the band keep it going for another 20 years or so.
B004I654WQ|5.0|I loved the movie and had to own it on blu ray,They have released this more than once on bluray ond the sound is different on all.i dont know why this is so as it's the only pixar movie that they have done this with,the only reason i can think of is if people upgrade their audio they might upgrade to the bluray with the better sound.The dts-hd sound far out shines the standard audio,unless you just play through your tv the sound means nothing but if you have a good sound system, the dts-hd makes the movie come to life around your lounge or theatre room.So my advise is look for the dts-hd as the cost is about the same.You can still find the dts-hd if you look around

B004FECNIO|5.0|The film is somewhat like a modern-day Pinocchio but deals with the philosophical notion of artificial intelligence and is much more human and emotional.  It has amazing effects even now, and a brilliant art design.  Many complained about the ending but it's not as 'Hollywood' as people realize, nor is it a really depressing ending.  The ending is very fitting for David's needs and furthers the contrast between man and machine.  The film did a great job of making you think of what constitutes a human and whether we should treat David as just a machine.  The film never blatantly poses this question for you, it naturally arises.  I never understood all the hate this film received, it's one of Spielberg's best since Saving Private Ryan.   I think many people expected more action, a more straightforward ending, and didn't expect the sometimes bizarre art-style in the film such as the 'flesh fair' scene.      Some of the dialogue can be rather poor though, but not that often.  There's also some great dialogue and performances in the film by Haley Joel Osmont (at his best, better than Sixth Sense in my opinion) and Jude Law (one of his best performances, possibly his best).      Sidenote:  The 'supertoy' Teddy is also one the greatest sidekicks and animated characters ever put on screen.  I loved the character (not just because he's so cute) and he really added to the film and David's character.
1595141715|3.0|I wondered how Jay Asher was going to support the dual narratives and it was done very tastefully, with very little confusion.  I totally felt both Clay's and Hannah's emotions, though I had some problems.  Clay was incredible. He was \\"that good guy\\" who everyone likes. He was just..the perfect character for this. He was so genuine.  I didn't like Hannah, though. Whenever she went onto the next tape, the next reason, I was so hopeful that I would get it. But I didn't, and the entire narration just screamed \\"angst\\". But a little bit...I got it. We're teenagers. Teens blow everything out of proportion, and I can...excuse...Hannah's behavior, I suppose. But she didn't make sense to me.  And then we got to the reason that Clay got these tapes and it felt like...like such a cop out.  Not to offend Jay Asher, but one thing about the book reminded me of--dare I say it?--Twilight. Twilight was incredibly addictive for no reason; I couldn't put it down, and I didn't even like it that much. I like 13 Reasons Why more, definitely, but not enough to read it at 2 am. But I was glued to the book until I realized how late it was and summoned all my willpower to stop.  The ending was incredible, though. My favorite part was that last page. It got me thinking, huh. Maybe that ball of angst did some good in the end and I'd love some sort of epilogue, to see if it's true, but that ending was so hopeful, and put this big smile on my face.  Sidepoint, no reflection on review: Curious, I decided to hear the audiobook. Right now, I'm listening to a free sample from Random House, and--honestly?--I recommend you pick up the book, even if you usually listen to audiobooks. Clay sounds like the guy who did voiceover for Hiccup, from How To Train Your Dragon (yup. just listened to a bit of the HtTYD trailer for a comparison, and it's uncanny). And Hannah sounds like a 30 year old chain smoker. No offense, but I recommend the paper book.    The book wasn't bad, it just wasn't my cup of tea. I highly recommend it, though. This is a book that needs to be read, thus why I reviewed it. Though I can hardly handle the fact that it's going to be movie-fied, and by Selena Gomez.    Rating: 3 stars. Mediocre book.
0061906220|5.0|I dearly love this book, so much that when I first read it I purchased copies for a few kindergarten teachers that I know. I also read it on my website and had adults and children alike comment on what a wonderful life lesson it contains.<br /><br />People of all ages can benefit from this wonderful story.<br /><br />I LOVE MY WHITE SHOES!!!<br /><br />Gratefully,<br />Christy Jordan
0307477479|5.0|Egan follows the lives of several different characters over decades in this novel. The way she shifts the point of view from each character highlights the flow of time and the effect it has on all of us. Each of the characters we experience relate to one another in some way--as family, old friends, or a one time acquaintance.    The last chapter in particular was one of my favorites, as it raises some interesting questions in regards to the implications of technology, especially hand-held devices such as our cell phone computers. When discussing this section of the book at a recent event, held by Columbia College in Chicago, Egan said she was \\"picking up on things in the air and imagining forward.\\" Her imagination proved pretty accurate to the present day and our near future with children being inundated with technology from their birth. She foresaw,\\"class issues between off-the-grid people (without internet) being divided from those that have internet.\\" As a society we will notice people starting to fall through the cracks unable to get into the flow of information.    This point reminded me of a local news show (not Chicago) where the vapid reporter \\"took to the streets\\" to interview homeless people and had the idiocy to ask them if they'd heard of the media buzz surrounding a homeless man in another state that went viral on the internet for his radio voice. Then seemed shocked when they didn't know what she was talking about. Egan made one of her characters, Scotty, one of the disconnected. In complete irony he becomes a sort of icon because he is seen as mysterious since no one can look up any information on him.    Another feeling that is present in the novel is how we fall in love with certain times and memories in our lives, and how the nostalgia can either affect us as a fleeting memory or we can dwell on the past. Dwelling on the past can cause us to compare our trajectory in life to others that were once close, Scotty resents Benny when he hears that he has become a big-shot record producer while Scotty resorts to fishing in the city's river for food. It's a quick read and you'll love relating to how certain characters completely change over time. Overall this book is an entertaining, there is variety in the characters' personalities and points of view. Sometimes we even receive different characters' takes on a significant time period--which is always fun. I look forward to diving into some of Egan's other works.
B0013N4AT0|5.0|Still Life is an amazing piece of work.  It traverses a multitude of genres, but never completely leaves the death/black metal roots behind.  Opeth had already shown an aptitude for blending death, progressive, and folk music styles on their three previous releases, but Still Life finds them perfecting the mix.  Also notable, this album sees the first overt infusion of stoner metal elements, as with the Sabbath-influenced riffing on Moonlapse Vertigo.  I wasn't quickly won over by Still Life, hearing more clean vocals than I cared for and resisting changes to a band I liked as it was.  But, repeated listens are needed to fully grasp the balance of styles presented on each track, and to appreciate the album as a whole.  I now find myself going back to Still Life more often than most of Opeth's other cd's, and rank it with Morningrise and Ghost Reveries in my top three.  Of course, the order of those top three changes a lot, because each time I listen to one of the albums, I move that one up to the top spot.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|Love this particular collection and season! More meaning and dramatic twist than expected. A must see for David Tennant fans and Doctor Who fans alike.  He adds an emotional side that hasn't been seen in previous seasons to pull you to him more than ever.  Answers to other questions that we've always wondered. Doctor Who Confidential holds just as much pull too, due to it's more candid takes from everyone who has been involved in this Collection knowing that this was a final season for David Tennant as the Doctor. Wonderful guest actors who push the dramatic side even further as an extra gift for this collection. There is a funny side for added comic releaf that we love to see with the Doctor in selected pieces and to lighten things some for the kids who also admire the Doctor as their Hero. It give charm and sentimental wanting, to not see the Doctor go, but a wonderful farewell for David Tennant and his version of the Doctor, to seal the fates that have always been in Doctor Who fans minds.  We will miss this Doctor, who has been one of the best versions of the Doctor in many years!  David Tennant was exceptional in his perfomance for all of us to love and keep in our hearts for generations to come. Great actor and a great completion to a Fantastically Wonderful 4 year run!      I have had several Doctor Who fan Parties just so everyone can see this collection. Everyone wants to see it and loves it!  Glad I got it, will recommend it always!

0393327655|1.0|In this book there is no mention of how atheism is a faith and of how atheism can motivate people to commit atrocities.<br /><br />The author seems to be a fan of Buddhism and subjects the reader to a stream of Buddhist drivel, \\"Experiment in Consciousness\\" on page 216. In the notes on page 232 he even states, \\"There may even be some credible evidence for reincarnation.\\"<br /><br />Of course, there is no evidence for reincarnation. He calls the book The End of Faith, yet reincarnation is strictly a matter of faith, no reason.<br /><br />As others have stated, he says he approves of torture and deplores pacifism. He asserts (p147) that \\"We are now living in a world that can no longer tolerate well-armed malevolent regimes. Without perfect weapons, collateral damage - the maiming and killing of innocent people - is unavoidable.\\"<br /><br />If there is no faith, if people are just biological machines, then why care about issues such as abortion? Harris declares that there is \\"not the slightest reason\\" that embryos have the capacity to sense pain. He also makes the bizarre comment that \\"Whenever the president scratches his nose he is now engaged in a diabolic culling of souls.\\" He reckons that \\"much can be said as of almost every cell in the human body\\" as can be said of the human zygote (fertilized egg). The implication seems to be that if it is ok to kill zygotes, then what does it matter if other cells are killed. And as humans are just collections of cells then what does it matter if other humans are killed off?<br /><br />P.78: \\"By contrast, the most monstrous crimes against humanity have been invariably been inspired by unjustified belief.\\"<br /><br />Hitler, Stalin: Darwinists who used their faith to justify their atrocities.
B000JIHP88|5.0|We received this mobile as a gift and starting using the white noise/music player when our twins were about 1 month old and still sleeping in our room in a CoSleeper (we put the music player in a side pocket as it cannot be attached to a CoSleeper).  When we transitioned the boys into a crib in their own room, the mobile really helped them to calm down and sleep.  The toys on the mobile caught their attention from the first time we started using the mobile attatchement, around 2 months.  They really distract a crying baby and help lull him to sleep!  We had no problems at all attaching the mobile securely to the side of the crib.   We use the music for naps during the day and the rainforest noises for night time, both on the low volume setting.  The night light makes just enough light for the baby to be able to see the toys at night but not be kept awake.  The mobile also helps the babies wake up happy, we come in the room to them smiling at and talking to the toys.  The remote is nice when the boys are almost asleep and just need a little more white noise, I keep it hanging on the nursery door knob.  We bought a second of this mobile when the boys got too big to share a crib because we liked it so much!
6301562178|5.0|Once upon a time a style of movie became extremely popular in the 1970s. It was called the \\"disaster film\\" and was very successful for some time. The recipe for a disaster film went like this; gather a bunch of big-name actors and put them in a highly dangerous situation together. Give each of the characters an interesting past, maybe some recurring problem that they solve in surviving the disaster. Throw in lots of high-budget scenes of destruction and death. These kinds of movies seriously cleaned up at the box offices, and made the big-name stars in the casts considerably wealthier.     TOWERING INFERNO is the best of the lot. The special effects are terrific. The plot isn't dopey. There are many highly suspenseful scenes. Let's not overlook the cast, folks! Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Fred Astaire, Jennifer Jones, Robert Wagner, Robert Vaughn are the best-known, but there are plenty of other lesser-known actors who give equally good performances, who make you feel like you're inside that 138-story building seeing it slowly destroyed by hellish flames!    AIRPORT, POSEIDON ADVENTURE, and EARTHQUAKE all have their merits, but TOWERING INFERNO is to them what the Beatles are to rock-and-roll: the greatest.
B004LUS390|5.0|A nice little art program that I enjoy on my pc is now in the palm of my hand. This program makes almost no compromise in its design. Just a about every thing is here, even layers. best results with a stylus but you can do great stuff with your fingers too. There is currently nothing that comes close to this app in its capabilities on the market. I find it ideal in sketching ideas on the go. A practiced and steady hand is required. As a creative person this is one of my personal top ten apps for Android. I hope more apps like this come out in the future. Currently being used on a thunderbolt.
1450400957|5.0|I found this book to be very informative in ways I had not expected. I was searching for a program of strength building to add to my current cardio and weight-loss plan. \\"Strength Training Anatomy\\" gives simplistic steps to creating a strength and muscle-toning (sculpting) program to fit each individual's lifestyle, ability, and time allotment. I did not expect the vast amount of exercise detail, practical advice, and the impressively detailed artwork that displayed the muscle sets to be worked for each. This is the book I have been waiting for and truly needed!!
0670022411|1.0|How in God's name can the Amazon staff review call this a \\"one-sitting read?\\"  I can barely get through a single chapter in one sitting, let a lone the entire book.  I am currently 200 pages into the nearly 600-page behemoth and I am not sure if I will ever be able to finish it.  I am not sure I even care.  I am no stranger to ridiculously long, verbose books (I am quite the Tolkien and Anne Rice afficionado), but very long + very boring does not a good book make.<br /><br />All of the other negative reviews on here have said it much better than I have - in short this is a boring, plodding, un-interesting brick.  The plot has definite potential but the fact that I'm a third of the way through and pretty much nothing has happened is not very encouraging.  The characters are flat, uninteresting and totally un-engaging.  Why the hell would I want to read about people who are perfect in every way and have everything they could ever possibly want?  If that's what I was interested in I'd just go read internet fan fiction.  There is zero conflict and drama in the book.  Others aren't lying when they say it's literally the \\"heroine\\" reading, doing yoga, drinking tea, rowing, running and staring longingly into her (rich, perfect, genius) hero's eyes.  I have gotten this far into only because I paid for the damned thing and the consumer (and the English major) in me are somehow trying to prod me into seeing this thing through to the end.  Unfortunately, I look forward to another chapter in this book the way I would look forward to a root canal.<br /><br />Sad to say, this book is more or less \\"Twilight\\" for grown-ups.  The fact that it is being compared to Anne Rice is beyond silly.  If I was Anne Rice that would be insulting.  Rice may be able to spend ten pages describing a door knob but there is a definite purpose to her narrative, not to mention all the stimulating philosophical and ethical discourse along the way.  At least those books made you think, even when not much of anything was happening plot-wise.  Most of Rice's characters might have been impossibly beautiful, but they had personality flaws aplenty, enough to at least make me be able to identify a little more with them, lowly imperfect non-Oxford educated human than I am.<br /><br />Please, I implore you, save yourself the money, or at least take it out of your library for free.  I am going to try and finish it on the off chance it might redeem itself, but based on what I've read so far and what others have said, I am not having high hopes for it.of anything was happening plot-wise.

1591843790|4.0|I willingly buy and read all of Guy Kawasaki 's books.  This one has the feel of more crowd sourcing than his others. However it still contains some pure Kawaski that you may or may not have received thru his blog.  Eg how to set up a pro LinkedIn pp, why and how he used a Facebook product page vs a website for this book, tips on best uses of Youtube and Twitter.  He is a pro communicator so this is all useful stuff.

Both very funny and poignant at the same time, the alternating voices, written by alternating authors, vividly captures the overwhelming angst of teenage love, while propelling the story to a literal musical climax, that gives new meaning to the term,\\"Big Finish!\\"

The content of this movie impacts every person living in America whether they are aware of it or not.

160094048X|5.0|I have only been eating Vegan for the last two months. I checked this book out from my local library and was in heaven after making my first batch of cookies.  I only got 6 cookies out of that batch.  My husband and kids gobbled them up so fast. The cookies we have tried from this book are fantastic, not one bad batch. I can't wait to try the rice crispy treats and I can't believe they actually have a recipe for Samoas. I bought both this book and the cupcake book at the same time.  The cupcakes look even more heavenly, can't wait to try them. I own almost all of Isa Chandra Moskowitz's books and I have not said YUCK to anything yet.

B004LUHQ1G|4.0|I'm not going to go off and claim \\"this is the best FF album ever.\\"  Nor am I going to complain it's not \\"TCATS\\" or \\"TINLTL\\".  Wasting Light is what it is - a great sounding hard rock album, with (to paraphrase Mr. Grohl himself) loud guitars, catchy melodies, crashing cymbals and big drums, because, afterall, it's what he and the rest of his mates do.  And, as a rock fan who's seen the musical industry move away from what drew him in for the very same reasons, it is comforting and reassuring to see someone still doing that at such a level of quality.  The first thing that struck was the production.  I think I saw someone else refer to the sound of the album that listening to it through earbuds does not truly do it justice, and I agree.  Play this on a car system, and you get a much fuller feel of the music.  The guitars are fierce, and I love how the bass has been pinned to the guitars in the mix.  In fact, the bass sound on WL is one of the best I have ever heard.  It's thick, but, it's not sludgy.  As for the highlights, for me \\"While Limo\\" has been played on a regular basis.  Yeah, it's been compared by some to Weenie Beenie from the first album, but, really, it's just far more musically menacing.  The lyrics are meaningless...it's just being immersed in a wall of noise.  (BTW, anyone else think Dave is aping Andrew WK on the video?\\"  \\"Bridge Burning\\", \\"Dear Rosemary\\" (despite its lyrical clunkiness) and \\"These Days\\" are other highlights for me.  Someone else made mention of this, but, \\"Rope\\" really does sound something Rush of the recent years would have constructed.  Intersting to see Arlandria make another appearance in a Foo Fighters' song.  (Headwires, anyone?)  The cynical type might call this formulaic.  I think of it as being reliable.  Again, is it the best FF album?  (TINLTL is my personal favorite.)  I don't think that's even this issue.  The fact that, in these days when the music industry is in the state it currently is, and, when as a listener, I personally have never felt more removed from what is supposed to be rock'n'roll, Wasting Light reminds me of what rock music can still achieve in the hands of people who love rock'n'roll who have the talent to match.
0884271536|3.0|Dr. Goldratt refers to the story of his \\"novels\\" as \\"chocolate coating\\".  In Critical Chain I think it was just a little too thick.  The BJ story line was unnecessary and felt incomplete.  The classroom sessions felt rushed and a little erratic.  And, like \\"The Goal\\", the end is somewhat unsatisfying because it just stops dead, in this novel especially because its ideas, ideas, ideas, end.  Those ideas in the last chapter didn't feel properly flushed out to me.  Another chapter to tie together the threads would have helped a lot.    Never the less, the TOC spin on PM is excellent.  The \\"Colloquium\\" part of the book provides an excellent introduction or review of TOC, depending on whether you read \\"The Goal\\".  The ideas are priceless.    I'd recommend supplementing this with either \\"Beyond the Goal\\" or another book on Critical Chain Project Managmement (CCPM) in order to cement the concepts into more actionable framework.

B001YV502C|5.0|This film was amazing when it was released in 2006 and is amazing today. This movie is even better on blu-ray. This is one of Clive Owen's best films. I am not a fan of Julianne Moore, but she was incredible in this film as well.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I don't normally write reviews on here but I know when I was the buyer the reviews helped alot on this buy.    perks    great sound- you feel submerged in the game. can hear footsteps of enemies and where they are coming from. bass boost really makes a difference and no matter how much you've played a game you haven't heard everything they say or sounds that are made till it's on your ears  comfortable- the ear pieces are a good size but light and they don't make your ears sweat. they completely cover the ears... and i have big ears.   wireless-NO CORDS. well except for the ones you hook up to the console  chat boost- when the game volume gets loud you can still hear your teamates and you can hear yourself in your headset so it makes.    added perk... works with my cell phone while i'm playing!    cons  popping- when the battery gets low or if you mess with the mic too much or get out of range which is about 25 feet for my house you'll get this popping sound and it cuts the sound out for a second  over whelming- the sound is so awesome it's kind of distracting until you get used to it  eats batteries- would suggest rechargeable batteries  not very well made for 150 dollars you would expect for the things to be made out of quality materials not cheap plastic.      so hook up and game and enjoy a pretty decent set of head phones.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|I'll admit, I never was a big fan of The Foo Fighters until I saw their documentary that recently came out (totally check it out if you haven't, yet) and listened to this album.  It's very easy to think that someone like Grohl has got it made, but this dude is one of the most hard working people I've ever seen in action.  You know why they sound so badass?  Apart from each individual member of the band bringing their own remarkable talent to the table, Grohl is almost manic about finding the perfect sound to each song.  The man handcrafts these tunes and treats each individual song as though it's a newborn baby that he can mold into perfection.    You know why this band deserves all the attention they get?  Because they work hard for it and are damned good at what they do!      Hope you enjoy as much as I did.
B000FC2O48|4.0|I had never read Philip K. Dick prior to picking up Ubik and primarily read it because it was one of the books on the Time 100 Best Novels list. Most of the other books on the list have been overwhelming disappointments but Ubik was a breath of fresh air. Although I certainly wouldn't agree that it is one of the best books of all time, I feel that the story was an exciting, unique story that kept me wanting more.     I am generally not a huge fan of Science Fiction, but in this case, I was able to gain an appreciation for it and may venture in this realm a bit more in the future. Ubik was a great, easy read and I'm fairly certain that just about anyone would enjoy it. Unlike a lot of SF, I wasn't confused with the plot or setting. Overall it was very enjoyable.
0132350882|5.0|It is a very good book. It is easy to read with precious lessons.    I recommend to every developer even to those that do not work with Java.     It teaches you good practices and a better way of thinking about \\"how to write your code\\".    Read and apply it.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|This is the one. It's the iconic sci-fi space-opera epic. It began a franchise that has survived and continued to grow well after the author's death. It's a movie, a mini-series, a computer game, a role-playing game, etc. etc. etc. Like it or not (and I love it) you can't consider yourself well-read in sci-fi without having read this one.     The story follows young Paul Atreides from young, ducal heir on his agricultural home world of Caladan through his family's relocation to the desert planet Arrakis, also called Dune, and on through incredibly detailed and convoluted political intrigues on his way to avenge his father's murder and win the imperial throne. Wow, that is way too simplified. There's no way to appropriately describe or properly praise this book. It's a richly developed world, even in this single book, with thousands and thousands of years of future history created and seamlessly integrated into a totally engaging story. I've reread this one too many times for me to be able to remember. And I will read it again and again.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|This movie, totally just blew my mind. It was fawking great! I recommend anyone to really watch the original series first before watching the new Rebuild films. Ive been an Evangelion fan for sometime now. Started watching it at age 16 and I was really confused at the time since this story's themes contain psychological and philosophical material in it. But I loved watching it for the art, robots, characters and eventually the story. After watching this, it became instantly the greatest movie I have ever seen. It used to be Citizen Kane and the Dark Knight. But screw that, since this one just had more to offer and the plot is just incredible.<br />With all that being said, I wonder. When will good anime films (such as Evangelion)hit the big screens? I mean sure it has. like...ugh, Pokemon? And that was it. Japan gets the theatrical release, and some places around the world (even the U.S) it also gets shown but in limited locations. I wish one day I could see a great anime that will be as popular as inception or the social network, and have a powerful story, setting, animation, directing,and visuals as good as Evangelion. . .<br /><br />Uhh, other than that, the movie was great. :D
B00243FQFA|5.0|We've LOVED this franchise. We've got all ten seasons of [[ASIN:B000TJBNHQ Stargate SG-1: The Complete Series Collection]] as well as all five seasons of Atlantis, and all the SG-1 movies. We watch them constantly. In this season, you see a lot of story lines wrapped up and a big move for the Atlantis teams. This series has action, science, drama, comedy...something for everyone. All the actors that had anything to do with the Stargate Universe have been supremely cast, too. You are NOT going to be disappointed, except when you realize that the series really is over.
B004H0N4PC|5.0|Don't often get excited about new albums these days. But every now and then a gem surfaces. They're considered top of the class in the UK and it's easy to see why.  The comparison with Peter Gabriel's work is quite noticeable and they definitely have prog rock leanings without any pomposity.  It's one of those great works that will grow on you.
B002N5N5QQ|3.0|I couldn't wait to get the second season of Sons of Anarchy.    I liked the conflicts and tensions in the first season: the contrast between the philosophy of the clubs' founder, and the direction of the club; the tension between the club second-in-command and his physician girlfriend; the conflict between the club's leaders on where the club is going.  Most of all, there was the conflict between the criminal nature of the club and it's \\"draw the line\\" rules of ethics.    All these went out the window in the second season.  By the end, it was difficult to tell the different antagonists apart. All philosophical tensions dissolved, as problems were solved in a blaze of gunfire and by the roar of the gang riding together on the open road.    I found the whole direction to be uninteresting.  The characters who seemed to have some promise ended up compromising their own principles, without as much as a shrug.    I don't think I'm going to be ordering the third season. The thoughtfulness of the first-season writing seems to have been replaced by mindless action.

B0009VRHLK|3.0|I was gonna say people will either love this film or absolutely hate it. But, I'm right in the middle, so I guess that can't be said. The pace of the film is slooooow. There's no doubt half the viewers shut it off after 20-30 minutes. There's very little dialogue until nearly the end...if you can hear it. However we do get endless shots of Bud driving. Bud sitting. Bud staring. Bud being sad.<br /><br />Now it sounds like these are all complaints, which they only half are. I'm pretty open minded and I can usually get something out of any movie. He does set a mood at least, and Vincent Gallo no doubt thinks he has an amazing set of eyes. He does kind of. Chloe Sevigny doesn't even come into the movie for over an hour. Her part is about the last 25 minutes. She mumbles and performs oral on Bud. Without question it's the \\"climax\\" of the film. Graphic yes, but if you've ever seen a porno in your life it's not much of a big deal. I found her desciption of being abused by some other men more disturbing. This isn't the first film she's done where she was on drugs and raped (Kids).<br /><br />Overall I guess it's worth a watch, just so you can see the epitome of an anti-Hollywood movie. Did I mention it's slow? However I'll admit my favorite scene was one of many where we look out the windshield at the approaching highway, as the entire song \\"Beautiful\\" by Gordon Lightfoot plays on. It kinda was.
0240815807|5.0|It's extremely rare to come upon a book on audio mixing, or some aspect of audio production or processing, that's this well thought out and engaging.  I think Senior's gift to the general lore is that his book offers a practical, genuinely useful overarching theory for approaching and methodically working one's way through a mix project, which also serves well as a framework for interpreting the wide-ranging, disconnected information one finds on the web.    Senior explains the vital (and all too frequently breezed past) WHY of each action, gives logical context and sets of criteria that help you make sense of the disparate pieces.  His style is clean and considered, and his instructions are admirably clear of detail inessential to his main points.      I've read a great many of, if not all, the major books on the topic of mixing -- they aren't, after all, so numerous -- and while the better ones have many good things to offer and should not be missed, Senior's book is easily, imho, the most comprehensive.  The additional resources he provides on the web are a course of study in themselves, and seem obviously created and assembled, as was the book, with great care.    We're in an age where being mentored in a big studio has largely become a thing of the past.  Senior's book helps fill that gap.  It helps you makes sense of what's out there, and helps clarify what you already know.   It's as if I'd had a month-long internship at a great studio, been let in on all the important stuff by someone who knew what they were doing, and had somehow managed to take concise notes of everything that's genuinely important in getting the job done.      The book's a bit of a Rosetta stone, actually.  Enjoy.    Cheers.
0670022411|2.0|From the ratings, I see this book is clearly to some people's liking, but I'm not one of them.  I tried to give this book chance after chance.  I even got to page 400+ before I finally gave up, realizing it wasn't going to get any better.  I should've given up 30 pages in when I realized I'd spent a good chunk of time reading a book about someone reading a book.  I could've just written a story about myself.  And it continues to happen throughout the story.  I'm happy she's an avid reader, more power to her, but I don't need to read what she does.  Also, the character is very inconsistent.  One moment she's rejecting her identity as a witch, the next she's using her power. If it was a matter of her being unsure of her identity it would be one thing, but it seems more like the author is unsure of how to develop a consistent character.  Secondly, she makes choices with no rhyme or reason except, 'she forgot' or 'she just didn't want to do it.' The author also drags on with a few tangents, but I mostly skimmed through those pages and probably walked away just as informed but less bored than other readers.  I'd say of the 400 pages I read, they could've taken out 150 and made a much better story.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This may not be the most cerebral masterpiece to date. However its message and visual experience is just breathtaking.    I play it on my most beloved PS3, and the result is out of the charts. If it was a 3D version I would feel like in Pandora, just as I felt in the Cinema.    Just perfect. The extras are very nice too. Seeing how it was shot, delivers the notion of how hard it was on actors and director to achieve the result we see on the screen.    Yes, it is full of cliche and commonplace, but even so it is fun, the hours soar and you can watch it a hundred time. I am getting there.    The case is beautiful, lokks like a book, or an album.    This is the ultimate item for the not-Taliban Sci-fi fan, c'mon give this masterpiece a break, it is not Star Wars with the political, emotional and religious background, but hey the I-III movies were all loathed by the hardcore fans. So for what it may be this film delivers what it is meant to, good entertainment with huge visual amazement.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|No notes, no highlighting, none of the kindle features it is just a plain and simple reading application.  I was expecting a lot more from an application that is called Kindle, like Kindle features on your tablet.  I have this on my Motorola Xoom but find I have to use my Kindle to make notes and highlight, makes it a pain!
1580086810|3.0|In this book, corn is incorrectly categorized as a vegetable. This is a major oversight, considering the role of corn in our world. Corn has never been a vegetable. It is a major crop and commodity but it is a GRAIN and its impact reaches far beyond the culinary. Its uses are multitude, and it has also been implicated in the rise in obesity (corn syrup and other corn products, specifically), as well as in producing less-than-optimally healthful livestock which are used as our meat sources. Regardless of your view on the healthfulness or deleteriousness of corn, it remains a grain.
0670022411|1.0|I was so excited when I read some of the reviews for this book. I normally like books along this subject line. The amount I read usually varies but lately I have been reading a book every other day or so. Well let me tell you this book is putting an end to that. I started reading it a little over a week ago and am only half way through. It is so boring, so pointless, and really I don't understand how anyone could have given it any kind of decent rating. I really didn't like the twilight series, but I loved Anne Rice. I was hoping this would be more of an intelligent vampire series. Nooo! I even think the author \\"discretly\\" references Ann Rice when she say that Marcus had an unholy alliance \\"with a foppish young French vampire in the Garden District who had implausibly golden hair and a streak of ruthlessness as wide as the Mississippi\\". I hope I can mangag to finish this crap, but I am on page 300 and nothing in the smallest bit interesting has happened. I hate romance novels and that is exactly what this is turning into.
1400079144|1.0|Too many absurdities must be accepted by the reader. Examples: A bad guy turns out to be one of the character's own son, but the character never suspects it.  The same character's hand is cut off, but he suffers no I'll effects from it and doesn't mind it at all.  The bad guy is angry that his father doesn't bribe his way out of a Turkish prison. Then he bribes his own way out (which he could have done in the first place!) in a ridiculously elaborate scheme by faking his own death. His family accepts the body of the fellow prisoner he had murdered as his body and never suspects they are being scammed. And on and on. Everyone in the book appears to have the IQ of a centipede. Even the FBI, CIA, Capitol Police, etc., act as if it's their first day on the job after graduating from Special Ed.  I know. It's a novel. And I'm more than willing to suspend disbelief, but the Harry Potter books are more realistic and true to their world than this slap-dash effort.
B002ZG99TK|4.0|Once again director tony Scoot(Ridleys brother) teams up with Denzel Washington to deliver a fast paced action movie, this time involving a runaway train, you would have thought Denzel would have beens sick at even the mere thought of a train after the remake of The Taking of Pelham 123.    This time however he's the one on the train as he plays Frank Barnes who has been a railroad engineer for 28 years and hes training rookie Will Colson(played by Chris Pine) who''s fresh out of conductor's college and is having martial problems and who's mind doesn't seem to be fully on the job on hand, so much so that he attaches too many carriages to their train which is on course with a runaway train that's carrying highly flammable liquid and is going at 70mph. So of course the only two people who can stop the runaway train are Barnes and Colson! They have aid in the form of Connie Hooper(played by Rosario Dawson) a train yardmaster who has radio contact with them. Oscar Galvin(played by Kevin Dunn) is vice-president of AWVR and all he cares about is the money and bad publicity it's going to cost them. So what follows is Galvin trying loads of different ways to stop the train before it hits the curve in Stanton which is home to Colson's estranged wife. What follows is a fast paced movie that doesn't require too much attention to follow, no mad twists or disgruntled villains out to blow up the world unless he gets his money, no it's just a runaway train.    The movie is inspired by the CSX 8888 incident that happened in Ohio in 2001 which also involved a runaway train. The movie is well worth a watch for it's fast paced action, the sound on the blu ray did sound a bit muffled at times(listening through a high end amp and speakers), the picture was also not of the best quality(watching on a panasonic full hd tv) at times. If you like easy to watch movies you can't go wrong with this.
B004BBV88M|5.0|I enjoyed Harry Potters movies.  Now I'm enjoying them again w/ my son.  Great books and great movies.
B004SBX112|5.0|Where is the easter update????? I'm finding it hard to justify using the amazon appstore if I can't even get updates on par with the android market.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|I purchased 5 of these mics for a podcast I do. I use a mackie 16 channel mixer and wanted my other guests to have the freedom to move around on the couch and chairs without having to always keep distance from a standard mic. I found out about this mic from a gentleman who's using it in conjunction with a prosumer canon HD camcorder. The mic worked perfectly with this camera combination but when I got the mics from amazon and hooked them up to my professional mixer the volume was way below average. I had to turn my mic trim knobs up the entire way to get even a reasonable volume... and of course the noise floor came up as well - lot's of hiss and background.    I think this has to do with impedance and mic gain on mixers. Usually professional mixers prefer an xlr connection and a nominal mic volume. Camera's on the other hand use prosumer unbalanced connections - and account for this in chip design.    I'm keeping the mics because the lack of clutter and freedom to move outweigh the clarity of standard mics, however, I'm disappointed with the lack of headroom and having to turn the mic gain all the way up.    Also, I notice some steering in the audio. I listen to the main mix bus with headphones and i can hear the mic changing from mono to stereo. I know this is a mono mic but the mackie mixer doubles the signal for the main mix. I'm hoping that the battery might be going and a replacement will solve these issues.
0316098337|4.0|When I first began this book I read some reviews, but made sure to stay away from any spoilers.  This was imperative in establishing the right amount of tension for the read so I will do the same here...little content and more of the emotion it evoked.<br />I can start by saying this is a tough read for many reasons as it deals with psychological trauma and those will tug at the heart and mind, but the hardest thing for the reader may be in the actual reading of the typed word as it is written from the first-person perspective of a five-year old boy.  The sentences are therefore intentionally choppy, grammar is misused at times, pronouns missing.  It can be a ride.  Once you get into the rhythm of our narrator, Jack, it gets a bit easier.  It also seems that the author eases up on this a bit as the book progresses (or perhaps Jack matures) which helps though there are times when Jack's language skills take such a leap it is a bit off-putting.<br />While the book does well in evoking tension there are many things that might trouble the reader.  As noted, the subject matter is pretty horrific.  There seem to be many things that are too easily resolved.<br />This may be part and parcel of the fact that we are seeing this through the eyes of a five-year old where many things are seemingly magically resolved, but it felt as though there could have been a bit more substance.<br />The same goes for the latter part of the book as the subject matter changes drastically.  Trauma's abound, these needed to be further explored.  Also, as noted, the narrator seems to change his voice when it suits the author.  While noted as being precocious, it feels like someone adopting an English accent and then slipping into an American one now and again by mistake.<br />Kudos to the author for taking on a difficult voice.  Some things left to the imagination and filtered through Jack's perception (Mom's fortitude and cleverness, working in an impossible situation, etc.).  Sometimes it worked, sometimes it did not, but when it did it hit hard.not, but when it did it hit hard.

B002JVWQSW|5.0|I feel very strongly that family friendly programs such as Modern Family, with a Christian backdrop are very important for today's society. It is wholesome fun the whole family can enjoy, and quickly becoming one of my favorite shows. All the performances are terrific, but what makes Modern Family work is its relentless portrayal of recognizable family life.   Personally I relate more to the daughter character. My mother always told me not to marry a `handyman' because he would always say \\"I can fix that in 10 minutes\\" but never actually get around to it. This is her world.   The son Mitchell creates some controversy with his homosexual lifestyle, but personally I think it's good for America to see a family unit in this way. Him and his partner Cameron adopted a child from Vietnam and have `new parent' written all over their faces, but they are both very loving fathers.  I think the love and values expressed in this family are very admirable, and we should all strive to love a little more in our own lives. This show very cleverly shows us what a modern family can be with the right love and support, and I look forward to watching future episodes.
B004GYY714|5.0|dang cool     lots of fun listening to music from all over the world.  local stations as well.  sound is descent, no digital skips, nicely done.
B003YOZNBU|4.0|This movie was great, it did what I expected a movie should do....entertain!  Don't listen to all those lousy review from comic book nerds.  Yes, I was not expecting a good movie while reading some of those other reviews from Amazon, I'm glad I didn't listen to them and took my chance.  I have heard of Johnna Hex, first introduce to the name from the Justice League Unlimited animated t.v show.  I have never read any of his books, but I expected to be better than that movie with Will Smith, Wild, Wild , West.  Let me tell you this, the movie rock, the soundtrack I did not expect it be Metal.  Mastodon was the band who created the soundtrack for album.  Why not 5 stars instead of 4 well I guess it would have to be a resemblance to one part of the movie the crow, watch it you will understand.  Take a chance, have fun watch this movie.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I've only had it a few days, but so far so good. The inside is completely customizable to fit your specific needs. Mine currently houses my DSLR, 18-55mm standard lens, 28-200 telephoto lens and a 50mm prime lens, as well as bounce flash, lens hoods and a HD flip cam. The padding is great. Ample pockets and storage for extra batteries, charger, memory cards, etc. The bag already fell out of the back of my vehicle when I opened the liftgate and everything in the bag made it without a scratch. Well worth the money!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|After seeing this film, I can only see further in the recognition that I no can no longer believe in voting, as I feel that treason (like a cancer) has permeated throughout the entire body politic of our Nation. To vote is to believe in the system's lies, and feed the rats. So something much, much more stronger is needed--as such a disaster could not have happened without political prostitution, who only take their orders not from the voting public that they are supposed to serve, but from the banking industry. But also we could not have arrived where we are without public indifference, while our country has been stolen from us. I could not help but has a desire to see the traitors punished as only traitors can be punished--up against the wall and give them a chance to say their prayers.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|The game runs great on my epic 4g. It's also very addictive and fun. The game only has 3 modes but they're so fun, that you will never get bored of playing them. This game is totally worth your money and time.
0670022411|3.0|When asked about A Discovery of Witches I just say don't bother, to the great majority of my friends. Instead, grab a copy of Twilight and rip it in half. Then tear out about 50 pages of The Vampire Lestat. Find a nice cheesy romance novel, something with a heaving bosom and a tanned man with flowing locks on the front. Rip out and discard any steamy loves scenes and then add the rest of the book to the mix. Blend well and drink up. This will be more satisfying than reading this sanitized cliche of a book.    I don't passionately hate this book although my sarcasm may lead you to believe I do.  I am, however, passionately disappointed in this book, especially because the Amazon reviews led me to believe it was something far different than it is. I was very excited to hear that a history professor was taking on this subject thus I was extremely disappointed to find nothing much more than a standard romance novel cloaked in a mask of fantasy.  I went with three stars only because I didn't discard it but was able to force myself to finish it and because I can see the appeal for some customers.  For those adults who are stuck in the young adult section after reading Twilight, this may be for you.  For fans who love a darker twist you're going to have to stick with Anne Rice for now.    Yes, I finished it, but begrudgingly and rolling my eyes at every predictable turn.    Unhappy reader.
B001FB55L2|5.0|Can't say enough about this movie. The storyline was great and surprised me several times. I had seen the preview and figured I knew exactly what was going to happen, but that was not the case. The cast did an incredible job, every single one of them. Best movie I've seen since The Fighter.
B004SBX112|5.0|Definitely worth the slight wait for updates because its ad-free.  the lack of ads and slowdown from them is well worth it for me.  people need to stop whining... good lord.
0823015033|5.0|I have recently been exploring the art of sculpture and I have found this book incredible.  I haven;t seen or read too many others so I don't know how it stands up against other ones available but I can tell you it stands up on it's own.  It seems to cover everything I wanted it to in great detail, it has helpful hints and tips from making your own tools to completing your own work of art.  A great book, highly recommended.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Folks, it's a COMPANION to Kindle. It doesn't have all of Kindle's features because it's meant to be used on the go when you don't have your Kindle with you. however, I can see some value in the prospect of having a more full features version for tablets. But for smartphones? Totally unnecessary.
B001DHXT2A|5.0|I love movies.  I prefer DC to Marvel for my comic characters but I have to admit that right now Marvel is doing it right, they are making great movies with great actors and releasing excellent DVDs.  I got this from Amazon at a good price, a good movie backed up by a TON of extras make it well worth it, highly recommended.
0307454541|3.0|This book took a while to get into, like 100 pages. Normally I wouldn't stick it out for 100 pages but I'd been told it was worth it to slog through. It was. Once the story picked up I really enjoyed it.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I always like to try and play Devil's advocate, I like to find flaws in great movies to prove they are not perfect and I like to try and find the virtue in bad movies.  This movie does not make my job easy, it is well made, well written, well shot, well directed, well acted, everything.  It took maybe a half dozen viewings for me to find the few less than perfect spots but even then they are easily forgivable amidst the rest of the beautiful work of art that is this movie.<br /><br />The DVD for this is Great and the Blue Ray is amazing, I have three different copies of this movie I love it so much.  An amazing movie with amazing extras at great price, what more could you want?
B003L77TZI|5.0|Katy Perry is probably the most talented vocalist since Billy Holiday.  She's seriously that awesome.  In my opinion, she's more musically ingenious than Miles Davis and Duke Ellington put together.
B000BSNPRG|5.0|I recently bought this dvd. I have their other dvd, The Black Symphony. This dvd takes you behind the scenes with Within Temptation, as well as live performances. This is one of the best bands ever. I highly recommend this dvd for those who would like to see the band in some of their earlier years. :)
B004SBX112|1.0|Premium apps should be updated at the same time or sooner than their free counterparts. Uninstalling and moving back to the Android Market version until this is resolved.
0812550757|5.0|I first read this when it came out, and felt that while good, it didn't quite match Ender's Game. Now I feel differently. Perhaps it's because the ideas in the book and the position Ender takes have gradually resonated in my life. Some of the later books are fun, and they flesh out the story. There are few books, however, that plant a seed that gradually grows and changes the reader. This is one of them.
B004JST23A|4.0|Put simply, this album is a bit of a grower.  It doesn't provoke the same immediate impulse to don warpaint and take up arms as Battle Metal, or provide the same skald-like storytelling as The Varangian Way.  However, Stand Up and Fight more than makes up for these in excellent composition.  The result is an album that is initially disappointing to a long-time fan, but ends up being quite enjoyable when given enough of a chance.  The album would probably be better categorized as progressive or symphonic rock than metal, all things considered.      To anyone who has watched interviews with Nygard, none of this should come as too much of a surprise, as he has made it imminently clear that he has absolutely no intention of doing the same album twice, and has thus far lived up to his word.  Only time can tell what the next one will bring.
B004SBX112|5.0|It's a great app (especially now that i downloaded the ad-free version for free) butwhere's the easter update, the android market already has it! Bah!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It is the only game that I always have in my phone. All of the other games get boring very quickly for me but not this one. I love the sound effects, the controls are very easy to use and the graphics are really nice. I have also never experienced any crashes or other problems with the game.
B001UV4XI8|3.0|This review is for the Bly-ray/DVD combo pack.  Buyers should be aware that the only way to watch the special features for DEATHLY HOLLOWS is on the bluray disc.  They are not included on the DVD or digital copy.  As for the special features on the bluray disc, they are okay, consisting of mostly standard featuretts and the maximum movie gimmick that has all sorts of interviews and even readings from the book included while the movie plays.  It's okay but I can't imagine watching it more than once.  Beware of the digital copy as it includes lots of spyware and garbage you may not want on your computer (and the download takes up a mind boggling amount of space).  The transfer of both the bluray and the parts of the DVD that I checked seemed fine to me.  Complaints about the darkness and lack of color in the film seem to be fairly true to the original look of the film and are not really the result of a terrible transfer.  This is however by no means an exceptional looking disc.  Take \\"professional\\" reviews of discs on sights like HighDef Digest with a grain of salt as negative reviews from them mean repercussions from the studios who send them all sorts of freebies, swag and other forms of \\"payment\\" for good reviews.  On a well calibrated HDTV above 46 inches the bluray (and upconverted DVD transfer) of DEATHLY HOLLOWS will look fine but it certainly isn't ever going to pop or look colorful (and it isn't supposed to).  There is also some digital noise during a few sequences on the BD and they were more pronounced on the DVD.  There isn't any excuse for it other than slopiness from Warner. As far as the playability issues, they are most likely due to a DRM change at Warner and you will have to do a firmware update to your BD player.  If you have a player more than a couple years old (unless you are using a PS3) you will probably be out of luck and will have to watch the DVD or buy a new BD player.  /  This is a very standard 3 disc release these days which means you get (mostly) the same thing in three different versions.  If you want all the special features the only way to get them is on the BD version.  Walmart has a DVD only version that has special features but it DOES NOT include the maximum movie material which makes up the bulk of the special features. This scenario is becoming more and more common (standard practice for Disney with every release) and if studios make money from it ... it isn't going away any time soon so do your homework before you buy a disc.  It sucks but thats the way things are going.      By the way...the PQ on the DEATHLY HOLLOWS bluray isn't any brighter or more vibrant than the DVD but there is a bit less noise.  THE AQ is noticeably better.  Undoubtedly Warner is saving lots of good stuff for the Ultimate box set edition which will be released after the final film.  Then the Limited Collectors Edition.  Then the Anniversary Edition.  Then the MudBlood Half Prince Hedwig Memorial Edition with collectible film cell made from genuine digital frame capture.  Then the Hagrid's Hut Edition with Keepsake keychain............
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I use this app both on my EVO phone and my Motorola Xoom tablet and it always works great. I love not having to transfer my songs from the phone to the tablet or viceversa. I connect my phone to my car radio and listen to music as I drive. The only problem I have is that when I get a phone call, the music keeps playing and I have to stop it manually. But still love it.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|I am not a huge fan of Country Music, that being said, I really liked the music.  I was surprised at the quality of the singing of the supporting actor & actress. I might have to buy the CD.  I think critics have been too critical of the actors performances. Everyone is entitled to their opinion.  I rented the movie, and watched it three times. I was kind of surprised at what happened to the Kelly character.  Usually I am pretty good at figuring movies out.  All in all I thought it was very good.
B004SBX112|4.0|I know that this game was (ad) free, cleaver way for amazon app store to get new customers.  But... why so late on the updates. Yes,  its that serious. Nice promotion, poor updates..
160059672X|4.0|I have been waiting for this book. And I have to say I am not disappointed. Although the directions may be very similar from project to project, that's because the technique is essentially the same--BUT there are always variations! And of course, because you will be working with stone cabs among other materials (such as obviously beads), your project will be different, because stone cabs are not all going to be the same.    I'm a long time fan of Sherry's work, and of the lady herself. It goes back to that wonderful December Bead and Button cover from about 7 years ago with her collar. I managed to eventually contact her to let her know how inspiring her work was, and I have since done one major collar with plans to do more (eventually, along with all my other projects!) I had the delightful experience of finally meeting the lady herself at the 2004 Bead and Button show. She really is one of nicest beaders creating and teaching and inspiring today. She delights in seeing what she had inspired in others, and is very happy that she has inspired so many people. And this book just continues that inspiration.    I think her instructions are clear enough that beginners can try some of the smaller projects, and of course intermediate and advanced beaders can also learn from this book. Just looking at how she puts divergent materials and colors together is worth the price of the book.    You may be wondering why I only gave the book 4 stars--as others have said, I would have liked a list of bead colors, suggestions for alternatives, and most of all a list of resources. I realize that Sherry probably has contacts in the gem and stone industry, and she may not be able to reveal them. But there are other resources that the average person can use, and it would have been nice if Lark books had included them, it wouldn't be too hard to find such resource information and provide it.
B004LUS390|4.0|I'm in the UX/UI industry and this application is essential to how I work every day. The ability to sketch a rough draft of a interface during a planned or ad hoc meeting is on the mark. I wouldn't hesitate to give it 5 stars now but I'd like to see some of their tool controls improve/streamline in future versions. That said, if it never changed I still would have little to complain about.    If you need a simple sketch/art tool that has layered support I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this app.
014241543X|3.0|If I stay was a good story line but it took me a little while to get into the story. It almost felt like a chore getting through the pages at some points. The story was a little slow moving for me, the main character Mia had a lot of flash backs and some of them went on for pages, which got a little annoying, and I found myself skimming through to get to what was happening with her in the present.      Not to give anything away, and I promise not to release any spoilers, but there is a part about her reminiscing over her baby brother being born and how he came out silent, and she says something like \\"he didn't come out crying like you see on T.V\\".. that part annoyed me, because it was very unrealistic and didn't make any sense, of course babies cry when they come out, and it's not just a t.v thing..  I understand it's a fiction story but it's supposed to be like real life and that part was silly to me, because I guess the author was aiming for that to be something beautiful, but I found that scene to be strange, a baby coming out and just looking at everyone not crying??..pretty weird..  Other than that I really enjoyed the love Mia shared with her boyfriend Adam, that was really touching.  The ending leaves you with a cliff hanger, and I know the sequel to this book \\"Where she Went\\" will bring closure, but I'm not really in a hurry to get the sequel because I wan't crazy about it to begin with.  The story is very sad but at the same time there were some parts that made me laugh out loud..     All in all, it was an OKAY story, I don't have much else to say about it.  I recently read some other books that left me thinking about the characters long after I was finished reading, this book didn't do that for me.
B003ES5ZTG|5.0|Excelent product, having the option of setting it up at multiple angles sure was helpful.<br />Seems solid enough, yet flexible.<br /><br />Previous hdmi cable I had bought were damaged after a few days because they were not flexible, and they tight space didnt help.., but this one got the work done pretty well.
0765322889|4.0|Gardens of the moon starts off kind of slow, and a few times I was a bit confused. As you get further into the book some of the plots/characters start to become clearer and easier to follow although it does jump around some. I usually finish a book this size in about a week and a half but this one took about twice that. I just wasn't drawn into the story early on like I usually am. I suspect mainly because of the early confusion that I had. Still its worth picking up a copy of. I plan on picking up the next couple of books in the series soon.
0061733199|5.0|I purchased this book as a gift for my son. He and I found it informative & entertaining. I recommend this book, highly.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|The newest CD \\"Illuminations\\" is a break from tradition for Josh Groban, in that he stepped out of his comfort zone, with Rick Rubin. Rick pushed Josh to write 11 of the 13 songs, making this album the truest, most definitive Josh, we have ever seen or heard. The emotion, arrangements, power and sincerity of each song, stirs the heart and moves the soul of the listener. My #1 favorites are: Higher Window, If I Walk Away, War At Home, Voce Existe Em Mim, Love Only Knows, Hidden Away, L'Ora Dell'Addio, Galileo and Bells of New York. The other remaining songs are all #2 on my list.<br /><br />When I first received this CD, I wasn't sure how I felt about it. It was so different from prior CD's produced by David Foster. Beautiful CD's, but a little too \\"perfect\\". This is more raw, more personal, like Josh is wearing his heart on his sleeve, fully exposed for all to see. By the third play, I was totally in love with this CD. Bravo, to Josh Groban. Your took a risk, it paid off!<br />[[ASIN:B0042JTDXK Illuminations]]
B0045ODPKY|4.0|If you like action movies, you will like this movie.  Parts of it reminded me of Bourne movies.<br /><br />I watched the Theatrical Version.  According to another reviewer describing the differences, I think the Directors Cut or the Extended Cut would make more sense.  Otherwise if the president is still alive, since he had seen everything, would he not know that Winter was a Russion spy?<br /><br />It is hard to imagine Angelina Jolie in her character kicking butt, but you have to just go along with the story, although implausible.

006621131X|3.0|I'm not exactly sure what I'm expecting when I read these rock/celebrity autobiographies (Clapton is another example), but it's not this. I kept thinking, \\"she's a poet?\\" The writing was just so drab and staccato. \\"We went here and did this.\\"  \\"So and so died and we were sad.\\"  \\"My boyfriend reveals that he's been having a homosexual affair, and I am confused.\\"  It all read so superficial.  I know a lot of the reviews have mentioned name-dropping, and I understand that the people were part of the experience, so she has to name them.  The problem is that she says so little about them that is meaningful.  We are just supposed to take it on face value that their art \\"was good\\".  She only describes about 2 of Mapplethorpe's projects in any detail, and she shares almost nothing of her work - so we are just left with her declaration that \\"it was solid, and it was good, and I knew we were on the right path\\".  It just doesn't tell you any more than you would have been able to get on Wikipedia about the dates, events, people, and especially the \\"art\\" - actually, you may even get more by reading Wikipedia.  I have to say, I did complete the book because I wanted to find out what happened(that's why 3 stars). Unfortunately, what happened was a big bunch of nothing.  Sorry, Patti, I think you could have done a lot better.
B002APNQF4|5.0|I saw Deep Purple in the Astrodome in 1974 when Coverdale and Glen Hughes was in the line up, I alway liked the Burn cd, and Coverdales vocals are awesome. I really like their music but this is my favorite cd, a lot because of Mel Galley on guitars, he is the most under rated player of all time, & now hes gone. The new album is good with Doug Aldrich & Reb Beach on guitars, quite a pair they are.
B004L79VUI|5.0|I've been a fan of Robertson's since The Band. I cried at The Last Waltz, but Robbie's never really stopped and in some ways, he's gotten even better with time. I've thoroughly enjoyed his exploration of Storyville, his native heritage, and now he's talking about my favorite subject--ROCK!     Our local indie station's been teasing listeners with the lead-in single \\"He Don't Live Here No More.\\" This one matches Robbie up with none other than \\"Slowhand\\" Eric Clapton. From the frequency of play, this is one ballad of excess the listeners could not get enough of.     My favorite once I got the actual plastic in my hands is the opener, \\"Straight Down the Line,\\" which jokingly touches on the old Christian theme that rock's the Devil's Music.     \\"When the night was young\\" talks about the Band generation growing up.     Another favorite and possibly the best closer of any CD I have heard in a long time is \\"Tango for Django.\\" What an amazing tribute to one of the best guitarists ever. I am not an instrumental fan, but this particular piece grabs you and won't let go. It's atmospheric and powerful and I'm betting someone like James Newton Howard's going to use this for the soundtrack of an action-romance film.     Rebecca Kyle, April 2011
B004CZ29E4|3.0|The book is beautifully written and has a compelling subject matter. I love audio books and usually enjoy \\"being read to\\" while I am driving. Unfortunately I really do not like the voice of Polly Stone, who is reading this story. I find her tone, fake accents and exaggerated pronounciations annoying and the worst are her extremely sharp C's and S's. After a while, although I am dying to hear more of the truly wonderful story, I have to take a break as listening to the hissing sound with every C and S becomes almost painful. In my opinion she may not be the best choice to read a book on tape. If I had bought \\"Sarah's Key\\" as a book instead, I would not be able to put it down!
B002T9H2L0|4.0|In addition to the great acting and good direction, the Blu-Ray transfer, for those of you interested in that, was the best I've ever seen - just flawless.    The movie was up for eight Academy Awards so you know there were a lot of aspects to it that were done well, from the acting to the photography to the sound and screenplay.  Yet - see below - I had read a lot of negative reviews on this movie and really wasn't anxious to see it.  I only saw it because it was free at the library. Afterward, I was so impressed I bought a copy.     As I reflected upon this film, I realized how good it must have been to keep my interest as well as it did for two-and-a-half hours of mostly dialect and a lot of it with subtitles.    It made me realize just how intense and good the actors were in this film, all of them with a lot to offer. Brad Pitt is the \\"big name\\" of the group, and his character is really strange, but there is an \\"unknown\\" German actor in here, Christopher Waltz, who stole the show as \\"Col. Hans Landa, The Jew Killer.\\" He was just mesmerizing, particularly in the opening scene which was incredibly tense. I'm glad to find out he won an Oscar for his performance.    Melanie Laurent wasn't far behind as far as good acting and an interesting character as she played the beautiful-and-vengeful \\"Shossona Dreyfus/Emmanuel Mimieux.\\"
0931838401|5.0|I am a retired public school art teacher who also taught black & white film photography classes years ago. I collect vintage and antique film and cine cameras as a long time hobby. I have a decent collection of several hundred cameras and some collecting guidebooks. I considered several of my books to be OK but since I purchased my first copy of McKeown's Guide to Antique and Classic Cameras, I don't even look at the other books now that I have this amazing and very easy to read comprehensive camera collectors guidebook. I now consider all of my other camera books \\"comic books\\" in comparison to McKeown's! I could go on and write pages of beaming review complements but in a nutshell, there is no better book for anyone who is starting out or a serious camera collector and/or retailer who wants the only book you will ever need with the possible exception of future issue releases. My only small suggestion to the publisher because the book is so massive and not cheap; is a consideration of a periodic condensed \\"update supplemental booklet\\" when new cameras and prices are added vs a whole new book for those who already own a copy. Other than that I could not be happier!
B004E547D8|4.0|I loved the first half of this film, then it got a little silly with the predictable Hollywood anti-CIA/government agenda but, overall, it was still a very entertaining film with wild characters. It's definitely something not to be taken the least bit serious, just enjoyed as a dark comedy with a fast-moving story and a good amount of action and intrigue.    John Malkovich - no surprise - steals the show with his wacked-out, paranoid character \\"Marvin Boggs.\\" Like Johnny Depp, Malkovich is very good at playing strange-but-always-interesting characters.
014241543X|4.0|Mia's life is perfect and then she loses pretty much everything in a horrible car accident. I enjoyed this book, I liked the author's use of flashbacks combined with the storyline. I have to say, I devoured the first half of the book, but then I started feeling like it feel too much like a Grey's Anatomy episode when someone from the main cast is being treated and they show you flashbacks of previous episodes haha!<br /><br />Also, around the half of it, I really got tired, for lack of a better word, of how perfect Mia's life was. Perfect family, boyfriend, friends, musician, to me, it would have been more realistic if a part of Mia's life wasn't perfect because really I don't think such perfect thing exists. This was a good, easy read, if you feel like weeping go and read it! I know I did shed a tear or two. I like books that have a moral to their story, If I Stay definitely has one, and it would the kind of book I'd like my kids to read.
B004L3AQFG|4.0|I wondered how filmmakers were going to keep the viewers interested in a guy stuck in crevice for five days. I found out: unique photography, a little humor here and there, a little romance, a little family sentiment, and a great job by both lead actor James Franco and director Danny Boyle.    The two combined to make much more of what could have been a boring film. They kept it interesting all the way.    This is a special treat in high-def, too, with the amazing Utah scenery and the unique camera shots by Boyle. That includes a number of split-screens and other creative stuff.
B001BRJZPW|4.0|1 of the movies was too corrupt to watch but the seller was most gracious & polite about exchanging it with no problems...thank u
B004A8ZWT2|3.0|This movie reminded of old films, '50s and '60s-type spy films in which there is little action but the characters are interesting enough to make you pay attention and see if you can guess who's who and what's what. Kind or like the 1963 hit \\"Charade,\\" expect this movie is much more low key. Cary Grant would have been ideal in Johnny Depp's role.    Despite mostly dialog-driven, Angelina Jolie and Depp have star-power faces that will have you involved as does the great European scenery and photography, which is first rate on a Blu-Ray.    All in all: a pretty good subtle film and worth at least a rental.
B001BC5HXG|3.0|I love to read family sagas and that is basically what this book is about - the story of two families - the Hamiltons and the Trasks and the background of these families' story is mostly the Salina Valley in California. This book is partly based on the author's life, or more accurately, that of his maternal family (the Hamiltons); in fact, John Steinbeck narrates the story - he is Olive's son and Samuel Hamilton's grandson. I have also read (Oprah's Book Club) that Cathy's character is based loosely on his experiences with his second wife Gwyndolyn \\"Gwyn\\" Conger.<br />This is primarily a book about brothers and their relationship - their rivalry, their love for each other and their guilt.  It is a book about Cain and Abel and how the story is recounted time and time again throughout history.<br /><br />All in all, \\"East of Eden\\" is great \\"storytelling\\" and a fabulous book to read for leisure, but don't expect much more than pure fun out of it. Important characters are flat (but others are so wonderfully complex and rich - like Samuel Hamilton and Lee for instance!), and the story is very melodramatic and appeals too much to cheap sentimentality; that said, it is beautifully told and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I wrote a more thorough review which you can read at my blog \\"52 Books in 52 Weeks - A personal quest to improve my writing in English.\\"

1582701709|2.0|This comment is not about whether what this book proposes is useful or not, though about the originality behind its proposal.     Look at this extracts first (not literal, translated into english from the spanish version of the original book they come from):    - \\"Every chapter of this book goes around the secret about making money and success\\".  - \\"That secret has nothing to do with what we currently understand as 'education'\\".  - \\"Thoughts are things, very powerful when combined with a well defined purpose, a persisting attitude, and a strong desire to convert them in wealthiness\\".  - \\"Wealthiness always starts as a mental state, with a well defined purpose\\".  - \\"People behind big fortunes have first dreamt, desired, thought and planned before getting all that money. You'll never get such fortunes if do not really first believe that you'll have it\\".  - \\"That mental attitude must be a real conviction, not just mere hoping that it will happen\\".  - \\"When you talk to your subconscious to ask for something, just behave as you would in case you already had what you are asking for\\".  - \\"It's well known that anyone will finally believe in anything if they keep on repeating such a thing to themselves\\".  - \\"Thoughts combined with emotions create sort of a magnetic field that atracts either similar or related thoughts\\".  - \\"You'll be elevated or demoralized by the ... Autosuggestion Law ... according to how you manage your thoughts\\".    These ideas above ... ARE NOT FROM \\"The Secret\\" ... but from another book called \\"THINK AND GROW RICH\\", by Napoleon Hill, and its first edition was in ... 1937!!!!!    It looks to me that there is nothing so new within \\"The Secret\\", except a pretty good work to communicate the same ideas following a different approach, and even though the scope was quite wide with this first book, some other books have been published later under \\"The Secret\\" umbrella to cover specific issues, e.g.: personal realtionships ... and money.    This is what I am evaluating with my comment, i.e. not the benefits anyone could get applying what The Secret proposes, but the fact that they were already well proved good quite some years ago, first half of the 20th century.

6305263248|5.0|If you're looking for a great action packed adventure with lots of shooting and phenomenal car chases you need look no further, this is it!<br /><br />The title Ronin, according to the booklet that accompanies the DVD, is from Japanese legends and described a disgraced Samurai warrior who had allowed their master to be slain and was forced to wander the land looking for work. After the cold war was essentially over, covert agents had to look for employment elsewhere as mercenaries.<br /><br />When a special job required the assembly of a team of crack mercenaries a group was brought together for a one-time job that turned out to challenge even their special skills at mayhem and carnage. This movie picks the viewer up and carries them along on a thrill ride that doesn't stop.<br /><br />The cast features Robert De Niro heading a number of very familiar actors whose names may not be all that familiar to the average viewer. The result is an intense action film that is completely involving to those who enjoy action films. I've viewed it many times and enjoy it all over every single time.<br /><br />Directed by John Frankenheimer, the film used a stark camera effect, much of which was shot \\"with a Steadicam hand-held Camera, giving Ronin a realistic documentary look.\\" The film was shot in France in a number of well known locations and \\"the climactic finale was filmed in Paris' Zenith arena, where nearly 2,000 extras were used in the chaotic sequence.\\"<br /><br />This is one terrific action film that will stand repeated viewings. If you enjoy the genre you'll definitely want to add this one to your collection.

B000002UB6|5.0|As the Fab Four began to experience the disillusion that eventually overcame the hippie movement in the late '60s and early '70s, understanding that they were heading to different corners, they wanted to do something to inject new life into the band and maybe a vitality that would bring them together and carry them forward. The result was \\"Let It Be\\".<br />Although it ultimately didn't work to salvage the band, it is a remarkable work of art in it's own right and probably laid the foundation for their final, and what many consider to be their finest, album, \\"Abbey Road\\".<br />It still surprises many people when they hear that \\"Let It Be\\" was actually recorded before \\"Abbey Road\\". It is somewhat surprising to realize the contrasting sounds of the two albums are due, in large part, to the band's efforts to sound raw and live with \\"Let It Be\\" and their apparent acceptance that they wanted to end with a smoothly-engineered masterpiece such as \\"Abbey Road\\".<br />But getting back to \\"Let It Be\\", it is widely known and acknowledged that John, with the agreement of the band, wanted that raw, live sound to dominate the album. This led to the \\"rooftop\\" concert. It is a testament to the talent of the individuals involved that they could sound so cohesive and play so well in the cold and damp of those rooftop recordings. \\"Get Back\\", \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" (not included on this disk), \\"I've Got A Feeling\\", \\"One After Nine-O-Nine\\", \\"I Dig A Pony\\" all were played during this concert and much of the recorded material was mixed into the final versions released on the album.<br />In watching the film recorded of the band in the studio, those sessions were very loose and off-the-cuff, incorporating covers of old rock tunes; some Beatles tunes, some other covers. None of the arguing reported during the recording of the \\"White Album\\" was evident, but there were glimpses of friction or tension in some of the scenes on film. Overall, it appears that they are either having some fun or bored stiff, with little in between.<br />All of this relates to the sound of the album in that there are diverse directions in this collection of what amounted to over 30 hours of tape that sat for months, waiting to be edited. And while some of the material does sound raw and live, Phil Spector's handling of much of the material ended up making it sound polished and engineered. Not that either one, in itself, is a bad thing, but it speaks to the dysfunction that was going on in the band at that time. Paul has been quoted as saying that he didn't care for the orchestration of \\"Long And Winding Road\\", despite the fact that it may have been the biggest hit from the album. Some younger people might be able to relate the wishes and problems that the Beatles had with the sound of the album to the way Kurt Cobain felt about \\"Nevermind\\"; which he felt wasn't raw enough and was over-engineered, too polished.<br />Having said all that, it is actually my opinion that the diversity of the album is a perfect union of the talent involved and the divergent attitudes of the individuals. From the rawness of \\"I've Got A Feeling\\" to the polished beauty of the title cut \\"Let It Be\\", this album and the project surrounding it became the last public glimpse of what many people consider the greatest rock band ever.tle in between.

B000VM9Z8K|4.0|This is the third book I read from Sophie Kinsella and I just love the way she writes.  Once again this book captivated me and gave me what I needed...some laughs, some love, a bit of action and a lot of relaxation.  I love how Sophie describes her characters as strong females.  I hate romance books that make women look like a sad version of 1800`s helpless and hopeless women with old values and morals.  Sophie Kinsella`s main characters live in the present, they are independant yet still feminine. I just love the description of the mother always using the dogs as an excuse to avoid certain subjets...I personally know people in real life exactly like that. I liked the book, it was a little bit predictable and maybe unrealist at times, but like all the other Sophie Kinsella books, but I just love the way she writes the stories.
B004NGYXIM|5.0|Mana has released an excellent listening CD. When listening to this new music from Mana you can not help but to concentrate on the lyrics. The most excellent singing from the group's lead singer Fher are on this CD and his vocals are more captivating on this work than in others they have released.<br /><br />This album is more alternative rock than danceable. The tone is very serious. The musical arrangements seem to try to express the heart of the lyrics sung.<br /><br />The cover of this CD from Mana illustrates perfectly the songs on this CD. Dark at times, Light in realization of coming to terms with what is being sung and the bird in flight like as if symbolic of a new direction. Very different from other Mana CD's.<br /><br />The songs seem to be tied together somehow. Mostly the tone and feel of the overall CD. This work does lack from lead guitar work. If I can compare this CD to another group I would say Pink Floyd without David Gilmour. Excellent CD.

As the album was being recorded we all heard snippets from what was to come, but i never predicted that the final result would be this good.<br /><br />In my oppinion Wasting Light is their best effort to date, every song is a winner, the Foo Fighters sound is stamped all over this album, big catchy choruses, crunchy guitars, massive drums... This album will take them to legendary status, up there amongst the biggest bands on the planet (maybe they are already there, but this will secure it)<br /><br />Even my music snob friends rate this album.<br /><br />This is a MUST get.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|It has begun!  The much touted HBO miniseries A GAME OF THRONES arrived with Episode 1, and though the entire series cannot be judged on one episode, this initial hour has all the promise of an involving and visually stunning adaptation of the 1996 George R.R. Martin series of books of adult fantasy fiction titled 'A Song of Ice and Fire'.  The 'game' is played by seven families - Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn, and Tyrell - and what we find in the initial episode is a taste of the intrigue to come.<br /><br />In this first episode Lord Eddard Stark (Sean Bean) is the patriarch of House Stark, one of the major noble houses of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and ancestral rulers of the North. Near the castle of Winterfell, Eddard's children discover a dead direwolf and five of its pups still alive. As the direwolf is the symbol of the Starks, Eddard allows each of his five children to keep one of the pups as pet. A sixth pup is discovered a short distance away from the others. It is a mute albino, and this one is given to Jon Snow (Kit Harington), the bastard son of Lord Eddard Stark. King Robert Baratheon (Mark Addy) , Eddard's childhood friend, journeys to Winterfell with his family to ask Eddard to become Hand of the King, the top advisor and military commander in the realm, due to the death of the previous Hand, Lord Jon Arryn. Eddard's wife, Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley), receives a letter from her sister Lysa Arryn, stating that Jon Arryn's death was a murder plotted by Queen Cersei (Lena Headey) and her powerful family, the Lannisters. Though reluctant to leave his duties and family, Eddard is convinced by his wife to accept the position in order to investigate Jon Arryn's death. Eddard's middle son Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead-Wright) is engaging in climbing Winterfell castle's walls and towers accidentally sees Queen Cersei and her twin brother Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) having incestuous relations. To protect their secret affair, Jaime throws the boy out of a tower window.

0792843584|5.0|I realize \\"Heaven's Gate\\" is a punch line, as well as a punching bag. Critics lined up to take shots at the film. Perhaps it's my inner-cowboy, or that I'm a large fan of Kris Kristopherson's song writing and singing, but I found the movie entertaining and interesting. Michaeal Cimini has become a whipping boy, and he was responsible for massive cost overruns, but the filming was beautifully done. Admittedly, I enjoy \\"westerns,\\" but I found nothing wrong with this film. The location was incomparable (near Kalispell, Montana). For those who say it's too long (3:40), I say, \\"Pack a lunch.\\" Enjoy the film for what it is--an American classic.<br />Jim Campbell

There's a veritable army of them out there now, small but growing, no doubt in response to the continuing erosion of legal aid availability.<br /><br />That these venerable and authoritative two volumes we have come to regard so highly, with the separate paperback books for forms and procedural tables, are accessible as much to the layman as the practitioner is good to know because it gives us confidence.  It's indicative of the work's logical layout and plain speaking, and the plain English approach of help to all.<br /><br />As the editors point out, the work functions as a guide, to the bringing, defending and appealing of proceedings on all three litigation tracks and is an indispensable source of reference for all practitioners and members of the judiciary, whether in the High Court or the county courts.  Certainly, the objective of providing `comprehensive guidance in as clear a way as possible' has been amply achieved in this latest edition for 2011, so thank you again Butterworths and LexisNexis.<br /><br />The book presents three main parts over two hard-bound volumes, with Part I dealing with rules and procedure (in particular with Civil Procedure Rules and Protocols); Part II with the general jurisdiction of the courts and Part III, with the special powers and procedures set out under particular statutes.  There is an especially useful section on `Developments Since the October 2010 Reissue of the Civil Court Practice'.<br /><br />An impressive feature of the Green Book is the ease with which you can look things up in - comparatively speaking - when in a large hurry if you have to.  The main volumes contain a list of key references and there are detailed indexes in each volume averaging a couple of hundred pages each.<br /><br />The full set includes two additional volumes containing respectively, `Forms' and Procedural Tables' also indexed in detail.  As you would expect, there are copious Tables of Statutes, Civil Procedure Rules, Rules of the Supreme Court, County Court Rules, Other Statutory Instruments, Practice Directions and Cases.<br /><br />For 2011, here is comprehensive guidance indeed - and, as if all this were not enough, there is an accompanying CD Rom.  The law is stated as at March 2011 and there is one tip for all: read the `How to Use Section' right at the beginning as it really will explain the incoming tide- we wish we had done that some years ago!th Part I dealing with rules and procedure (in particular with Civil Procedure Rules and Protocols); Part II with the general jurisdiction of the courts and Part III, with the special powers and procedures set out under particular statutes.

B00064WSNW|5.0|IF you are a hardcore Crimson Fan, then you are not reading this and you already have this album. If you want to taste this band for the first time, know that you will get a shiver from the experience of this unexpected spice. Cut in the dangerous eighties, this particular album is remarkable for many reasons, one of them being that the roaster of this album's outfit is the closest thing to perfection. Every cut is delicious and every musician plays here heroically and yet effortlessly. The signature of this collection is one of elegance and lust. You just feel like dancing from the get go. Bill Brufford feels real frisky and naughty on this album and I know that every percussionist out there keeps this album in a secret place. If after listening to this album you don't become a fan of the band, I know that you will be a fan of this album.

Or, to put it another way, putting the client first!  Successful retailers have done it for years; now the professions have to do it - and a good thing too.  Very simply, putting the client's interests before your own will eventually generate repeat business and ultimately attract more clients.<br /><br />As both a solicitor and management consultant, the author, Heather Stewart, points out that, a client's expectations of, and attitudes towards, legal services have changed significantly in the last 25 years.  Equally, adds the author, `the various elements of the Legal Services Act 2007 (LSA) will have an even greater impact on the marketplace and the way in which legal practices are regulated when they come into full effect in 2011'.<br /><br />As if all this were not enough, Stewart also foresees the day when legal practices can be owned by non-lawyers and attract outside investors, the result of which is that `the marketplace will change forever'.<br /><br />Underlining her point, she enlists the aid of a seasoned observer of law firms and lawyers in quoting Professor Richard Susskind.  His recent re-edited book `The End of Lawyers?: rethinking the nature of legal services' has created quite a stir internationally and no doubt scared a lot of lawyers on both sides of the Atlantic into dragging themselves kicking and screaming into the technology-based, customer-centric 21st century.<br /><br />As boosting business revenues by offering and providing perceived value is the very practical aim of this book, the major relevant areas are covered, including marketing branding and client service... motivating employees... and managing relationships, expectations and value.  The vexed questions of financial management are also dealt with in detail, from value and pricing to managing finance, billing and risk management.<br /><br />Clearly, Client Services for Law Firms meets an urgent need on the part of many a lawyer for expert advice and guidance in such matters as marketing, management and of course, client service -- a need which Law Society Publishing has addressed admirably in the timely publication of this clear, succinct and erudite book by an acknowledged expert in this field.entury.

160059672X|5.0|All I can say is that this is a fabulous book put together by a very talented artist.  The instructions are clear, the photos are beautiful and I want to make each item!!!  This was a book well worth waiting for.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is a great book. I enjoyed it the moment I picked it up. I can't wait for the next book. The characters are mesmerizing and developed wonderfully. The background of Cambridge  and the colleges in Cambridge are painted in a desciptive and wonderful fashion. This book pulls you in a doesn't want to let it you go. The author develops her story and characters in depth. Really found it delightful. The secondary characters are like the cherries on top.
B002GY9F9K|4.0|This show is very good entertainment.  I enjoyed it thoroughly and will also get Season 2.  It has humor, intrigue, and is worth the time to watch it.  The characters become more gelled as the story unfolds; they are likable and very interesting, given their different skill sets.  A warning:  there are some brutal episodes to which I wouldn't subject children.  One reason I enjoyed the show is because it takes me out of our modern times and into a world of people who have been trained in arts that are mostly no longer available to us.
B0000025CP|2.0|First off I am a huge Judas Priest fan. I consider Screaming and Painkiller some of the best albums ever...of any genre but compared to those albums this one sounds like a demo. It's obvious the \\"Priest\\" sound was being solidified and still in the works which is why I say it seems like your listening to demos rather than a finished album.     Either Halford learned to control his instument better or the engineer and producer didn't know how to capture him because as blasphemous as it sounds his high notes get annoying on Stained Class. When Halford goes high on Devil's Child on Screaming the effect is mind-boggleing but on Stained Class it can sound like cats fighting.     Sorry to say but this album is only for hardcore fans or to complete a collection.
1551113082|4.0|I read this for the first time for class. The extra stuff in the beginning allows you understand the context more and better analyze the text, (if that's what you're looking for). Otherwise its still a great book overall.
B0013V33DG|5.0|I'm really enjoying this opera, and so are my friends.  It's amazing to me that I can get the captioning in so many languages.
B001E45XT4|4.0|I understand those who question the sub-par quality of these headphones. The build material really isn't that great, and it is mostly made up of cheap plasticky parts. But... remember that these are 20 dollar pair of headphones. Corners will be cut in order to price it for as cheap as it is.     The sound quality is inferior to that of a good pair of headphones, but it isn't bad by any means. The mic works fine and it does its job.     These headphones aren't as comfortable to lets say, my Sennheiser HD555s but I can game on them for about an 2 hours before my ears start to hurt.     Overall, I will give these headphones are solid 3.5/5 but since I cant give half a star, I will give it the benefit of a doubt!
B003L20ICE|5.0|The movie [[ASIN:B00008979D Roommates]] starring Peter Falk, Julianne Moore and d.B. Sweeney is probably the best and real movie Moore has ever done. Roomates also had a wonderful message in it about a loving/caring grandparent(it will brings tears and laughter.) A must see!!!     This movie also has an important message that is worth noting. The world needs to stop being so hypocritical and judgemental. This movie has a great cast with some super stars on their way.    See this movie... live and let live.    Vi ses!
0670022411|2.0|I had high hopes for this book, but should have put it down within the first 50 pages.  It took half of the book to get the characters out of the library! And they didn't even have the spellbound manuscript!  All I could think of is the author is setting me up for a sequel.  That's pretty sad when you just start to read a book.  I want the current book in my hand to give me something to think and talk about..standing on it's own...not leave me hanging so I will buy the next book.  So Ms. Harkness...sorry...no purchase again from me.
B004G6009U|5.0|Since John Lasseter took over Walt Disney Animation Studios, a trend of quality has been noted in the features released since his commanding. Disney Animation Studios has a rich history and was one of the best (if not the best studio) in the animtion field. But since the 2000s, the studio became less and less succesful with awful movies that not only did not resonate with audiences but also were box office bombs. Since Lasseter took over the studio, only four films (Meet the Robinsons, Bolt, The Princess and the Frog and Tangled)had been released but each one of them are compelling and have pushed the studio up again. Following the phenomenal The Princess and the Frog (which also set the return of glourious hand-drawn animation into the studio), Tangled became Disney's 50th Animated film and I'm happy to report that is a sensational film that proudly fits that milestone.<br /><br />Struggling almost 8 years in production and costing over $260 million, Tangled had a very troubled production. Formerly knwon as Rapunzel, the title was changed in order to appeal to boys and to draw more money from the box office. While the title change is somewhat a debatable decision, it seems it worked because Tangled became a major box office success earning almost $600 million in receipts. Although the title was changed and the trailers showed a \\"contemporary\\" story, make no mistake: Tangled is a tradional musical fairy tale and is a really good one.<br /><br />I won't tell the plot here but let me tell you that the movie has a lot going for it: a compelling and likeable heroine, a brave and funny hero, adorable animal sideckicks and a memorable villain. Rapunzel is a very strong, free-spirited young woman who is easy to root for, the same can be said for Flynn Ryder the thief with a heart of gold. Pascal the chameleon and Maximus the horse are really funny and Mother Gothel is a very amusing villain. The animators and the voice actors have to be credited for doing such roundable palpable characters.<br /><br />The animation is simply amazing!!! It's the first time that a CGI Disney film can be up there with the Pixar catalogue. The humans are rendered marvelousy and the sceneries are breathtaking (specially the lantern sequence). But what struck me the most was how amazing Rapunzel's hair is. Is so beautiful and believable that really adds to the picture value.<br /><br />The score and the songs were done by legend composer Alan Menken and his new lyricist Glenn Slater. While the songs are good and serve their purpose in the film, they are far from memorable. They are not the best Menken has done and they are not at the same level as others like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast or Aladdin. Still the ones that I really like were \\"When will my Life Begin?\\", its reprise and of course the Oscar nominated \\"I see the Light\\" (which should've won the Oscar).<br /><br />Wrapping up, Tangled is an excellent film with outstanding animation, great characters and nice songs. An excellent Disney film.<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br /><br />Unsurprisingly by now, Tangled BD looks absolutely spectacualar. A lot of things can be said about the transfer but let me tell you that this disc is demo quality and will completely blew your mind. The same can be said for the 7.1 DTS-HD MA track which is dynamic, clear and potent.<br /><br />The DVD also boasts a fairly impressive transfer for SD and a good 5.1 Dolby Audio.<br /><br />Bonus Material:<br /><br />You have some deleted scenes, two storybooks openings, a 50th animated countdown (which is great), a making-of featurette, two extended songs and 9 teasers.<br /><br />While all the material is great, the making-of featurette feels really promotional and too short to be entirely valuable. I was hoping for a more compelling documentary that will talk about the music in the film, the anination and the production overall. Overall they are entertaining pieces but Disney could've done a lot more in the specialfeatures department.<br /><br />Sneek Peeks:<br /><br />You got some interesting Sneek peeks like:<br /><br />The Lion King: Diamond Edition (Coming this fall!!!)<br />Winnie the Pooh (in theaters July 15, same day as Harry Potter)<br />Cars 2 (in theaters June 24)<br />Dumbo: 70th Anniversary (not release date but is definetely coming this year)<br />The Incredibles on BD (already released)<br /><br />And more that for me are not worth mentioning. Also is worth noting that in an insert that came in the box, The Fox and the Hound: 30th Anniversary Edition and TFATH2 are also listed in a 2-movie collection 3-disc combo pack which will include a BD and a DVD for the original film and one DVD for the cheapquel. This set is going to be released this September.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />Tangled is another example that Disney is recapturing its magic again and delivering good quality animated films. With stunning video and excellent audio and a good (if lacking) assortment of bonus features, Tangled is a must-own title on BD. This set is great for the majority of us who won't buy 3D crap and doesn't care for digital copies.

031261246X|5.0|Mark Russinovich's Zero Day is a fun and entertaining novel. It reminds me of Ken Follett's many WWII spy novels: interesting character development, intertwining storylines, a little bit of romance, and a lot of action.  This is definitely a book that gets you hooked from the beginning and although you're left completely satisfied, you're sad when it's over.    Zero Day is an engaging journey of a terrorist cyber-attack through the use of a virus intended to leave the western world in a state of chaos.  I enjoyed the multifaceted narrator viewpoints as the plot reveals itself and Zero Day approaches.  Not only was the novel an entertaining read, but it made me more aware of current software and operating system vulnerabilities causing me to think twice before skipping over my \\"Run Norton Anti-Virus.\\"  I recommend this novel for anyone who wants a fast-paced exciting vacation read.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|Your new versions are crap, sir.  Please consider the majority of us who want the originals simply restored.  No enhancements needed.  We want the movies we loved and grew up with.  I will not buy this and hope no one else does either.  Thanks.
B001VNB54A|1.0|Unlike the Band of Brothers series, this series paints a very negative picture of the war and our Marines that fought for us.  Virtually every episode focuses on a Marine doing some either stupid or dishonorable.
B00005KHJR|4.0|I'm certainly glad I bought this because the extended version can't be rented anywhere. This movie is a musical, a tragedy, a comedy, and a bit of a masterpiece.
B001BTG3OQ|1.0|When the flash works, it's the best but it overheats quickly and turns off. I've used this now on 2 weddings and it quit both times after only 15 or so shots. It overheated both times. Thank God I had my second camera (Canon 7D with 430 EX II flash) as a backup. The Canon camera & flash got me through both events without any problems. I gave up using the Nikon 300s as my main camera because of the SB 900 flash unit. Different batteries gave the same results. If you only take a few pictures and leave several minutes between shots, you'll be fine, but if you need a flash to capture all bridesmaids and bride walking down the aisle, the chances are pretty good the flash will overheat and shut down after 10 shots or less especially if the church is large and dimly lit. I'm looking into the Metz MZ 58324N 58 AF-2 now as an affordable replacement. The only other option for Nikon users shooting weddings is the Quantum QF8N Qflash Trio with battery pack, which is out of the price range for most photographers. Wedding and Event photographers, stay away from this poorly designed flash, it will let you down.

0316069884|5.0|I am a huge fan of this author.  I loved his two novels, and so looked forward to this book.  Even though I knew it was non-fiction, his writing style is so entertaining, I was sure that he would have a unique perspective and presentation.  I was not wrong.  The preface alone is enough to make you love this book whether or not  you are a carnivore, herbivore or omnivore.  Foer basically says that, if you choose to eat meat, you should be aware of the choice you are making-ie.,  what goes into putting that food on your plate.  This background he explains in great detail, with references to published studies, experts in the field, and through interviews with everyone from PETA activists to Ranch owners and slaughterhouse employees.  At the end of the day, what we choose to nourish ourselves with is not only a moral choice, but an environmental choice.  Foer doesn't stand on a soap box and try to convert everyone to become vegan or vegetarian, but he gathers and presents sufficient incontrovertible evidence that how we currently raise animals for food (factory farming) is unhealthy, inhumane and unsustainable.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Well researched and put together. Everyone should see it because we are doomed to repeat the past if we are not informed and this is just one way to get some of the information. The downside of the movie is there is no call to action at the end, basically they paint a picture of what's wrong with the system that lead to the meltdown and how nothing significant has changed but then leave us feeling upset by this with no where to go.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Loved this second book in the series - would have loved it even more if it hadn't taken so long between books. I'm hoping the third one comes along a little more quickly!  I highly recommend this second book to anyone that enjoyed the first one.... and I recommend them both to anyone that hasn't been introduced to Rothfuss yet - what a treat!

B003HKN52A|4.0|Ok. Don't get me wrong Elvis On Tour is a excellent documentary of the king of rock and roll. A full 15-day city tour while filming in 1972. But there is something missing here. Oh yeah, Full length concerts of this tour in it's entirty. But no. What do we get instead just the movie. We don't even get at least on how the film was made. Now i already know what EPE interprise is going to do next but out a 2 or 3 DVD box-set of the original 93 minute film and 2 or 3 concerts in full to get more money out of us. Well, they should have done that on this release or at least the blue ray version. When will they ever learn. Never, i guess. Elvis would have blown his top if he found out his fans we're being suckered into this crap of a such dvd release. Now mabe i am being a little to harsh but i know some of you all or really pissed right now along with me because of this dvd release. Elvis fans deserve better than this. This film was more than just a footage acts of live material it was a 15-day city tour that filmed several if not all of the concerts for this movie. ah well. At least we got the DVD. But still. It deserves a better release than this. EPE Will most likely release more On Tour after the fact.
B00005B4GT|5.0|Amnesiac isn't your older brother's Pablo Honey or the Bends.  The guitar driven alt rock that defined Radiohead took a back seat and the band moved in new directions on this album.  The album is rumored to have been recorded in the same sessions that produced the Kid A album, albeit the tracks reserved for this album were less commercially viable.  However, that should only peak your interst, because Amnesiac contains some of the most experimental and challenging tracks the band has to offer.
9889979942|5.0|I met photojournalist Tom Carter during a long trip in China in 2006. Being myself a professional travel photographer i quickly became interested in his work and this project. We were in the little and stunning UNESCO town of Pingyao.     Months later, after years of work finally this book was published. A wonderful, fresh and diverse portrait of the huge country, where words leave space to hundreds and hundreds of colorful images of people, places and emotions. A kaleidoscopic view of China through the eyes, the smiles and the tears of the people of this controversial country. A beautiful and recommended coffee table book, thoroughly reasearched during years spent travelling in every single state of this immense country, trying (with successful results!) to go past the usual cliches associated with China.
076115678X|5.0|I am completely in love with this book! I talk about it all the time to people who I know have curly hair but straighten their hair all time. I like my curly hair but never really accepted them and after reading Curly Girl, I can say I'm on my way to doing so. Really great book, with tips I had heard of but also some newer info I had never known about. My favorite part of the book is the personal stories from different people and how they felt about their curls before going natural! So if you're looking to embrace your curls and how to get them looking their best, this is a great way to begin.
B004N66XYE|2.0|The original Upstairs Downstairs was filled with characters you could care about, and it had all kinds of  true-to-life stories that involved the characters. The character development and acting was superb.    However, the new version is a huge disappointment. The characters are shallow and don't make me care about them at all. Even Rose, the excellent parlor-maid in the original series, is a disappointment. Her acting is stiff and her character is just plain uninteresting. The same with the other actors..stiff and boring.    After the second episode, I have no desire to see the rest!
B004EC5IUW|3.0|I'm a huge fan of the original series, which was an uncompromising personal artistic statement by its director, Hideaki Anno.  Despite its enduring popularity, it was not a series that pandered to a mass audience.  Those who say it fell apart at the end are sort of right, but the later release of the two movies \\"Death and Rebirth\\" and \\"The End of Evangelion\\" - which Anno has said restored his original vision for the series ending - redeemed that ending and properly completed an artistic masterpiece.    The two \\"Rebuild of Evangelion\\" films released so far are kind of an unnecessary update to the original series, condensed to the point of losing much of what made the original story so special and with alterations that in most cases seem gratuitous or even random.  This is even more true of Evangelion 2.22 than it was of 1.11.    For example, in the original series, the Eva pilots were all matched to a particular Eva unit, and there was a good reason for that (without getting into spoilers).  Eva pilots were physically and mentally incapable of piloting any Eva unit other than their own.  However, in Evangelion 2.22, pilots and Evas are mixed and matched seemingly at will, and new pilots and Evas are introduced that didn't exist in the original series, which are then mixed and matched too.  Unless both the reason and means for this are explained in later films, this seemingly destroys one of the central plot points of the entire series (the nature of the Evangelions).  There are many such examples of changes to the plot that some may not even notice at first, but which drastically alter what the series is all about.    Speaking of the characters, they've also been updated.  The main characters in the original series were all very different but all very rigid in their philosophies, and this lack of self awareness is part of what helped drive the plot forward and also one of the themes of the series.  In Evangelion 2.22, the characters universally mellow to the point that there's not much difference between them.  It's like the end of the Wizard of Oz; Shinji finds his strength, Asuka finds her heart, Rei finds her humanity.  That's nice, and probably something a certain segment of fans wanted to see, but it's going to make the later films (there are 2 more scheduled) a lot less interesting.  Also, there's a new character and Eva pilot named Mari, who at least in this film is completely disposable.  Meanwhile, Shinji's classmates, who played a major role in the series, play no role at all in the plot of this film and simply take up screen time that could have been used to better develop the plot, or Mari's character.    The film is beautiful to look at - like Evangelion 1.11, it maintains the visual style of the original series while updating almost every shot to CGI.  It may not be obvious in every shot, but many shots were created in CG and then processed to look like film, with a judder effect.  On the other hand, there are a *lot* of \\"fan service\\" shots in this film, which may be good or bad depending on your point of view.    I won't give away any spoilers but the ending of the film also leaves me wondering where they go from here, and how they're going to manage to fill out two more complete films.  They're basically already halfway through \\"The End of Evangelion\\".  I think they simply tried to do too much in 2 hours of screen time.    Overall, as a big fan of the series, it's nice to see these characters again and it's nice to have something new going on, but if you felt the original series was flawed, the current film series is even more flawed.  And while the original series was more or less one man's artistic vision, the current films feel more like filmmaking by committee with maximum box office receipts in mind.
B00000JXVK|5.0|Great Racing action despite the goofy soundtrack and bits,I like The Harleys and Like RoadRacing(not really in there)but I can't complain since the flattrack racing is just as good and close.

B004QYZATW|1.0|I was expecting a whole lot more from this movie.  Minus the beauty of Angelina Jolie Voight, the movie was very lethargic and ultimately predictable.  I know there is a CSI Effect in movies now, but the reconstructing the burned note was ridiculous (I speak from 13 years police experience).  I knew as soon as she met him on the train he was indeed Alexander.  A Bugs Bunny plot is more engaging.    This moving gets the big ONE thumb down.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I'm not going to lie. This review hurts a bit. In the last 10 years, NOTW was one of, if not the, finest work of fantasy I read. TWMF is a pale moon-cast shadow to it's predecessor. While still better than most of the fantasy flotsam out there, the expectations for Kvothe's continuing saga were perhaps too great to find level footing. The story is captivating, but less so. The hero is far more human, but much less convincing. I expected TWMF to really flesh out our Superman and begin to bring his legend into sharp relief. Instead, we spend 100 pages meandering about for bandits largely doing nothing, 100 pages in the arms of Felurian largely doing nothing, 200 pages in Ademre, again doing nothing. The first half did not advance the story nearly as much as it should have, but it was more interesting. The last half of the book could have easily been shaved by 300 pages. In a nutshell, he sees one of the Chandrian from afar, has some sex with one of the fae and learns how to keep a 10-year old girl from beating him up. In one sentence, I've given you the meat of what took 400+ pages to tell. I was so let down. I'm not seeing the development of the character that was so masterfully handed out in tantalizing doses in NOTW. TWMF was not great, but held its own to about the point where Kvothe left the Maer. It's all downhill from there. I can smell the winds of the fantasy faeries lifting our hero from the enchanted land of the trilogy into the muddled waters of the quadrifid or pentad. I'm unconvinced that the suddenly overwordy Rothfuss can pull our story to a close in book number three. It will probably take four or five to finish which wouldn't be bad, but for the downturn of TWMF and the wildly unnecessary four-year gap between volumes. At this rate, George RR Martin's Ice and Fire series will seem prolific. First half gets 4 ½ stars. Second half gets 2 ½ stars. 3 ½ stars overall.
1599218011|5.0|I loved this book, read it from cover to cover, I finally found someone who eats the way I think you should eat and she is not so strict about PH like some other books I read, I really enjoyed reading it and sent it to my sister and recommended it to others. I always buy my books at amazon, they are the best prices, if I see it in another store, I go home and order it from amazon and save on the price.

B002ZG98Z0|2.0|I was a big fan of the show, and I enjoyed the first movie.     I was not a big fan of this movie though. I did not like the way it portrayed Big and Carrie's marriage. Carrie is upset that they don't go out to fancy restaurants all the time. When Big comes home with takeout she gets upset. I just can't believe how much money is being tossed around without a second thought. Eating out, getting takeout every day, that's so expensive, especially in NYC. And I hated Carrie's reaction to Big wanting to relax at home. Not every day has to be spent out partying and getting drunk. What's wrong with cuddling on the couch? It doesn't mean you're in a rut, or that you're boring as she implies. And Big asking to spend 2 days apart every week? for me that would be the end  of the marriage
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game.    What can be said about such a much-read and -reviewed topic?    I enjoyed Orson Scott Card's vision of the future, where survival of the human species leans not only on combatting the bugger threat, but developing a system of population control, orbital colonies, and planetary habitats. More so, however, I truly enjoyed Card's opinions on utility and utilitarianism demonstrated in the narrative.    Ender Wiggin, as we know him, is a five or six year old boy at the beginning of the novel. Despite his young age, he demonstrates more maturity than a well-travelled, experienced, world-weary man. He knows he is a tool, and will be treated like one by the government agency tasked with sharpening his edge. He is also extremely aware that this sharpening process requires time, and more so - pain, of both the most excruciating physical and mental nature alike.    There is a powerful message here, something that goes beyond the realm of the characters, the plot, and the setting.     While I won't tell you how to feel about it, I encourage you to read Ender's Game, and allow it to probe what you consider right and wrong.    You never know when the buggers may arrive.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|The Production and the direction were phenomenal.....It is a rare occurrence when a truly great movie hits the screen and this is one of them....I saw a few negative comments but after reading them I realized that those were the kind of people who think that \\"Something about Mary\\" was superb so pay no attention.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Watched the full season on TV on AMC when it aired last year. Great TV series, not completely focused on mindless zombies, also has a good storyline to follow along with, (so far). So this is great to watch with your partner or spouse, as it is not your usual run of the mill gory zombie show, although there is plenty. ;v) Character dynamics are good, acting is pretty fair considering some of the talent is fairly new to the screen. I liked it enough to buy the Season, but i am a horror/zombie fan to begin with so. Figured it would be great to watch commercial free.     Aside from this product itself, was seriously bummed out when i found out we had to wait until this year's AMC Fear Fest for Season 2 to begin.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I just finished watching this movie - don't usually watch animated movies. However, I've never watched an animated movie this well done.  Going by what else is out there, maybe I never will.  Apparently, there are people out there (or at least one that I saw) who didn't like this movie.  So...they're not human, and they're FOR SURE not robots, so what are they?  They obviously should not be allowed to reproduce.  Too late now - oh well.      Anyway, everything that needs to be written has been, so lets just say I was absolutely stunned - watched it with my mouth open. I just couldn't believe the wonderful minds and talent it took to make this movie.      OK, now my real reason for writing.  If these are reviews of moviemaking, why let people ruin a movie's rating by reviewing stuff like the box it came in, the art work on the box, didn't like the shrinkwrap, etc.  While some of the issues are legit, like receiving in bad condition or late or whatever, I still don't think this is the forum for that kind of review.  Why don't you folks handle these issues with Amazon?  Amazon has never ripped me off - they have always handled any issues in a timely and satisfactory manner.  If you kids still insist on making your whining public, maybe Amazon could have two catagories - one for moviemaking and one for customer service issues.      By the way Amazon, feel free to compensate for my ideas - love your service, Babe!
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Perfect gift for my husband. He loves to watch this and I could not have found it at a better price!
B003ZSH606|3.0|Warning: this review is after only 1.5 listens....    I'm a long-time Jamiroquai fan.   For me, tracks like Stillness in Time (the extended mix with the salsa outro especially) and Just Another Story were a brilliant mix of funk, soul, and world music, which is what sucked me in and made me a fan.  As the years progressed, the band became Jay and the focus became trying to get to the top of the pop charts and getting played in the dance clubs, or so it seemed.   There have always been hints of the \\"old\\" Jamiroquai in subsequent albums, but things got progressively polished to a high pop-dance sheen.  Sometimes it worked for me, sometimes it didn't, but I've remained a fan overall.    The sample tracks that I heard from RDLS just didn't grab me, and I feared that the pop monster had finally swallowed Jamiroquai whole.   While this doesn't stack up with the first 3 albums, for me it's at least AS good as Dynamite and Synkronized, and definitely better than A Funk Odyssey.  I'm not going to say that this album is a return to form, but I will say a couple of things it has going for it:  1) Greater bench strength - there's not a track on the album that I hate, which hasn't happened since Traveling without Moving I think.  2) Stretching out a bit - some of the songs use odd time signatures, switch gears in the middle, and generally take some risks - there's very little here that is radio-friendly in my opinion.  The experiments don't always work, but at least he's trying.  What it doesn't have:  1) Even a handful of songs that make you want to replay them right away.   The only one that has stuck with me is \\"Two Completely Different Things\\", which is really one of those warm soul major-key shimmering-guitar tracks that I am always a sucker for (see: Seven Days in Sunny June).   Other than that, there's plenty of agreeable stuff, but nothing that makes you go \\"damn that was great\\".   So while the diversions from the pop template are welcome, they aren't necessarily inspired either.    So,for the reviewers that say this is the best Jami album in a long time, that's probably faint praise, but I tend to agree.  For the people that say that this is a lazy attempt that isn't worthy of the name Jamiroquai, I disagree with them but I see the traits that make them say that.       Overall, I think if you are a long-term fan of Jamiroquai that loves the Stevie Wonderish 70's soul sound and have been on the fence about picking this up (in the U.S., this is not a straightforward decision due to the import price), I would say go for it, you'll be happy you did in the end.  If you're new to Jamiroquai, probably best to start someplace else like Return of the Space Cowboy or Traveling Without Moving.  If you're the type of Jamiroquai fan that really likes the dance-pop stuff....you'll likely think this album is kind of boring.
B004P9FAK2|1.0|They only put the extended cuts on 1 & 2 as a way to make collectors buy this whole cash grab DVD series.    There are no extended cuts of the films on 3-6. Save your money.    You already have these on DVD and don't need to spend 30 bucks to see a bunch of silly \\"making of\\" videos that will be very much like the ones you've seen before.
B00006CXSS|1.0|Very disappointed simply because I can't pick up half the dialogue (especially over the gunfire in most of the scenes).
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|For years, whenever someone does something amazing, awesome, and wonderful, I have said that they have \\"fired their laser\\".    Yet again, the Foos have fired that wonderful laser of theirs.     Even though they have released lackluster albums from which I never thought they'd recover, they have, once more, dazzled us with their skill in rock. This is undoubtedly their best album since my favorite album of all time, Colour and the Shape, and Wasting Light goes toe to toe with that, too. They took what they learned from their last 2 albums, and combined it with what they do best; alt rock. Suddenly, we're going from a song that deadmau5 remixed to classic Foo to hardcore punk, and it never gets bad. In fact, not one song on Wasting Light is bad, not even one lets down, not a single track is not a good song. It's awesome.    All in all, if you don't already own this album, HURRY UP! You're missing something special.

0670022411|3.0|I had such great hopes for *A Discovery of Witches*, having read glowing reviews and raves of \\"it's an adult's Twilight!\\" Imagine my disappointment, then, when the book turned out to be an amalgamation of Twilight, Harry Potter, and a little Possession, where the sum total is much less than each of its parts.  *Spoiler Alert!* You know things are bad when the hero of your adult fiction romance book is even more of a prude than Edward Cullen. Come on, Ms. Harkness, even Edward Cullen, King of Literary Chastity, couldn't wait to bed his bride. Add to this a near obssessive description of every morsel the characters eat and drink, lengthy descriptions of which pair of leggings our heroine is wearing, and a whole Dr. Seussian page or two dedicated to our heroine waiting for her man to appear (\\"I waited on a chair. Then I waited by the door.  Then I waited outside!\\") and you've got a book that is full of unrealized promise....and filler. That being said, I still want to read the other eventual books in the series, if only to find out the resolution.
0312323867|5.0|The first book I read by Emily Giffon was SOMETHING BORROWED. After thoroughly enjoying it I had to get other books by her. So I ordered SOMETHING BLUE as well as others. SOMETHING BLUE is a continuation of SOMETHING BORROWED, although it stands on its own as a great story. I don't think you have to read SOMETHING BORROWED to enjoy the book. Again, this is a book that I couldn't put down. Are there any better ones than that?
B002APU580|1.0|Just awful. The Bennett family is portrayed as low rent trash living in a grimy, disheveled house. including a pig being led through the house. Jane Austen's Bennett family was provincial but had a throughly respectable living situation. They were gentry not hillbillies. Keira Knightly uses her usual set of smirks and grimaces to portray Elizabeth Bennett's agile mind. Bendy lips do not convey wit. Matthew MacFadden is too old for Darcy and Keira Knightly. Keira Knightly acts like a spoiled and head strong young teenager not a complex, captivating and independent thinking young woman. Austen's Lizzy is nowhere to be found. It makes Darcy look like a bit of a creep when he ardently confesses his love for the adolescent acting Lizzy. Even worse is the \\"romantic\\" ending when Darcy  further expresses his love for the newly wed Elizabeth. Keira Knightly returns his coy drivel with all the giggly enthusiasm of a schoolgirl crush. The scene feels like we are eavesdropping on a teacher who has run off with his student.  The technical aspects of the film are even worse. Poorly written dialoque, abrupt advances in the storyline  make the plot confusing and unconvincing. The only saving grace is the beautiful photography. Otherwise a waste of money and time.
0743517830|5.0|The product arrived in good time. There was a slight confusion with my order, and the seller was very communicative, prompt, and helpful in facilitating the transaction. I was pleased.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Excellent quality. This is the same as the box set on sale in the UK but for some reason it was about £10 cheaper to import it than buy it here. Highly recommended. The suits at the TV channel should never had cancelled it.  Just another example of them not knowing a good show when they have one.
1604443502|4.0|Down and Out in Paris and London, Orwell's first published book, is a masterpiece that depicts with clear, honest language, the true condition of the urban poor in the 1930s. Structured more like a memoir than a novel, the first half describes the conditions of the poor in Paris, the unnamed narrator meets a series of down and out (though rarely less than eccentric) types in dingy Paris hotels, and eventually finds employment as a Plongeur - dishwasher, in a series of hotel restaurants. This gives him the opportunity to experience life as an unpaid drudge. Working the same dirty repetitive job, poorly paid, no union to protect him (the reason for this lack of representation is clearly explained in the book), gives the narrator scope to explain the mind sapping routine of the manual worker. He concludes with a rallying call to arms about the pointlessness of the Plongeur's work - how he cannot even claim it is socially useful. All he is doing is serving (usually badly and inefficiently), the desires of the wealthier clientele that frequent the hotels, often themselves being ripped off in the process.<br /><br />The second part of the book is devoted to the author's native England. There, he frequents similarly low life condition in the spikes and hostels frequented by tramps and beggars in Kent and London. He meets Bozo - a tramp and philosopher and several other low lifes, their stories each unique and fascinating such as the fellow old Etonian, drunk on cherry brandy, expensive brogues poking out of the filthy hostel bed sheets, but all united by a desperate, ruinous poverty.<br /><br />Orwell is unsparing in his description of filth, discomfort and squalor of the tramps' lifestyle, and is magnificent on the details - the practice of picking up used cigarette ends to try and form a miserable cigarette of their own, the hand to mouth existence of the pavement scrievers on Embankment, and the evolution of street slang.<br /><br />His evocations of life literally on the breadline (bread and marge, or cheese was the standard tramps' fare, many were little short of starving), are harrowing. In Paris he explains that there is a certain liberation in only having two francs in your pocket as you can't plan more than a day ahead. How far Orwell was genuinely reduced to this condition we should question. Biographers refer to the stipends he received from family members, which allowed him to pursue, relatively autonomously, his writing career. His destitute nature may have been largely simulated to gather material for his book, rather than a genuine reduction to destitution. This doesn't devalue the book, but perhaps accounts for it not warranting the full 5 stars, given that an account from a person who genuinely faced lifelong poverty would have that extra harrowing bite to it.nd marge, or cheese was the standard tramps' fare, many were little short of starving), are harrowing.

B004L49K20|5.0|DD is back again with an excellent album.  You can hear the early sound of DD which was the best generation of the group.  I can feel their energy, good melody and fruitful arrangement again!  They tactfully add some music arrangement from their famous songs to make the fans excited and refresh their good old days memory.  I would recommend Girls Panic, Being followed, and the title song All you need is now.  BTW, if you bought the US version, please also buy the UK version.  The package is quite different and special although I still think if they put some recent photos of the band would be better.  You know it is always good to see your old friends.

B001UV4XI8|4.0|After the disappointment of HBP, I wasn't real sure that this would be a fitting windup to the HP films.       For the most part, DH1 is a noticeable improvement and a return to the standard set by HP1-4.  There's some dropped stuff (Harry not in disguise at the wedding), some unlikely continutity problems caused by the Cuaron films (look, the Burrow arose from the ashes !)but especially relative to HP6, this follows the story well without amy \\"helpful\\" additions.     The biggest disappointment in the deleted scenes is the cuts of scenes with the Dursleys.  the scene in the movie (Vernon staring at Harry staring at Vernon) would have ben much more powerful with the inclusion of the scenes with Dudley and Mrs. Dursley.

B003VANOFY|5.0|I purchased this headset last week and have been playing games and watching movies with it ever since. The audio quality (especially the bass) is superb and allows for immersion into all the audio playing. The microphone audio is crisp and clean, and allows for adjustment of your voice using pitch and morphing. The noise isolation is so fantastic, I couldn't hear anything other than the music playing (so well I couldn't hear family members yelling at me for something!).    I recommend this headset to anyone who plays games or watches movies and wants a great audio experience, wirelessly.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|Fast paced, good fun read.  Some have complained that it's overly technical ... I fall into that category myself so for me the best thing about this book was that it deals with reality in the technical field.  It doesn't make up bogus technical scenarios to support the plot, it uses real, existing technical issues that the computer industry has to deal with today to produce a story which is quite feasible.      As far as cyberthrillers go?  It's a great romp from beginning to end.  Thoroughly enjoyable, recommended.
B004LAIU4I|5.0|Paul Simon doesn't crank out releases the way he used to but always pops up every five years or so with a new album,with different results of course. But one thing that can always be guarenteed is an overall high level of quality and he isn't about to give up on his talents as one of America's most revered songwriters. A lot has happened in the world around Simon during the last five years since he released an album and on this recording,which reunites him with his classic 70's producer Phil Ramone on an album that contains the same sort of strong melodies and unique mixtures of different rhythmic stylings while still presenting another new concept that actually says something about where Simon sees himself in the world and the effect those observations are having on the psyche of others.<br /><br />  \\"Getting Ready For Christmas Day\\" sets a great tone; a chuggin uptempo folk/soul rocker featuring the Reverand JM Gates and his congregation in the backround as Simon speaks of the joys of the holiday set against.....say soldiers spending yet another year overseas in whatever war is being faught. On the zydeco styled rave up of \\"The Afterlife\\" to the full on return to South African pop on \\"Rewrite\\" the theme becomes clear on this album; that the kinds of issues Simon saw around him in the 60's and 70's have not disappeared but more become so enormous they've gone out of people's notice almost entirely. But there's no cynicism here either as slower,more melodically anthemic tunes such as the deeply spiritual \\"Love Is Eternal Sacred Light\\",\\"Amulet\\" and \\"Questions For The Angels\\" deal directly with those seeking answers to their questions more from on high than within themselves.<br /><br />  This poetic outlook on the similarities to two generations facing something somewhat similar sociologically comes to a head on the title song,which musically ends the album the way it begins while making it clear that Simon is more than aware of what's going on around him and isn't quite the old singer-songwriter fossil stereotype some of his contempories seemed once in danger of becomming. So here we have a conceptually/lyricall rich and potent album that presents an array of different songs that take new and exciting production and rhythmic spins on ideas Simon's explored,and on some he hasn't and it does in fact emerge as one of his strong recent albums for that very reason. It's been a long time since a new Paul Simon album was really much of a cause of excitment with me because they seemed to have a hit or miss nature from song to song. On this one there isn't anything like that and it's worth just about any music lover to hear it.t clear that Simon is more than aware of what's going on around him and isn't quite the old singer-songwriter fossil stereotype some of his contempories seemed once in danger of becomming.

0956251579|4.0|Not the usual genre of novel I would select but a gripping novel that keeps the tension right until the end. Well written, unusual in it's perspective and in the voice of the 'narrator'. Complete characters that you can believe in. I was a bit frustrated with the main protagonist at times in the same way you watch a horror film and think 'don't go out there you silly...' but the story does enough to explain why she acts as she does.    If you like pyschological thrillers and or crime fiction, you'll definitely like this. Just don't read it at bedtime with the doors unlocked!    All in all a great debut novel, something a bit different from an author who has clearly mastered the art of great story telling.

142311339X|2.0|1)  Spelling, punctuation, and grammar errors run rampant throughout the whole book.  This may not bother some, but it certainly makes reading it aloud a nightmare.  The editor should be fired and sent back to 3rd grade.  Such errors are frustrating and inexcusable in my opinion -- it ruins the whole flow of the book and the credibility of the writing, despite decent storytelling.    2)  Of course, this may sound prudish...but this one had far too much emphasis on amorous longings and desires.  Children who enjoy the mythology, adventure, and storytelling don't need to think it's normal to obsess about how to get someone to kiss you (although, I do get that Aphrodite is involved in this).  Perhaps it would have been more enjoyable to make this idiosyncrasy appear humorous, but the author is actually trying get readers (young girls, at that) to identify with this main character who swoons throughout the entire book.  Sorry Mr. Riordon, but there are more to girls than that.  Your other female protagonists were far more admirable.    3)  Again...prudish...but, do you really need mild cursing or \\"pseudo-cursing\\" in a book?  It certainly doesn't add anything positive.  The intended audience is children - they'll get plenty of exposure to the delicate art of swearing eventually, so there's no place for it in a child's book.  If you don't want your kid to use it in normal conversation, it shouldn't be coming from the good guys.    Because the storytelling is still enjoyable enough to keep us interested, we will probably read the next installment.  I just hope it's more pleasant to read.  So...get a new editor and bring down the infatuation a notch or two.
B004GCPJDQ|4.0|Just to balance out the reviews here, I wanted to share my own experience. I've had this for two or three months at the office, and it's worked flawlessly. The only drawback is that the charge doesn't last much longer than a day, so if I forget to rest the mouse on the charger in the evening, it's usually run down the next morning. No big deal, really, and beats having to always keep two sets of batteries in charging rotation. I'm even ordering a second one for home!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|If I were stranded on an island and could only take one book with me, hands down, this would be my choice. This story doesn't just motivate you to run, or to get more active. It makes you realize how much \\"extra\\" we have in our lives. We've gotten so far from our basic roots that I think we forget what it is we have evolved to do so well... run. Give it a read. If nothing else, it's an entertaining story.

B0007TKNCY|4.0|Director Howard Hawkes used Cary Grant a lot in pictures and this is one of his first with the Katharine Hepburn/Cary Grant team -- their other one that year being \\"Holiday.\\"<br /><br />The DVD I saw had an audio track with Peter Bogdanovich, who directed \\"What's Up Doc,\\" a 1972 film which is a homage to Bringing Up Baby.  Lots of useful info !<br /><br />Plot:<br /><br />Susan is a crazy gal who hangs out at a golf course.  Not clear how she got there or why she was attracted to Cary's character, an absent-minded scientist who seems more interested in dinosaur bones than living a life.  Anyway. David (Cary Grant) is about to get married to Alice, a woman who shares his introvertedness and dreams of being a top museum in town.  She'd rather David stay and work on getting an endowment from a Mr. Peabody, who will be playing golf that afternoon.<br /><br />And so it goes!<br /><br />The vignettes are all set-ups for the audience to see the growing interest from Susan to David, how David wants nothing to do with her and how she, being somewhat eccentric, wants to keep him from going to New York and get him to fall for her.<br /><br />Oh, and there's this leopard, that is a tame one from her brother (\\"who tends to be vague\\") who gets mixed up with a wild leopard recently escaped from a circus wagon, which Susan had let out thinking he is \\"Baby\\", etc., etc.  You get the idea.  Who's Baby?  Her leopard!<br /><br />Much of the humor comes from major misunderstandings between the parties and the slapstick that peppers the film.  Some I'm sure were simply outrageous to 1930s audiences.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|This series was so hard to quit watching! I could sit down for hours...just to see what what going to happen next! I would buy this again in a heartbeat! One of the best purchases I ever made!
B0030Y11XS|5.0|With governors and congress alike calling the country bankrupt, nothing could be more apropos than this movie.  An entertaining explanation of how big business conspires to lobby government to legislate and enforce policies that benefit big business at the expense of the middle class.    Although Moore dramatizes certain aspects of the financial crisis, much of what he reports here is backed up by outside sources.  It's depressing, but Moore gives the way out - democracy means that if all the little people use their votes, they can ensure their future is not bought out by lobbyists.
B001AQR3IU|3.0|All discussion about the movie itself aside, I was disappointed by the quality of this disc. I have the DVD and have been slowly moving my collection of DVD's to Blu-ray versions. When I saw that Stardust had finally hit Blu-ray, I jumped at the chance to get better quality. Unfortunately, though, this Blu-ray doesn't look any better than the upscaled DVD. I fully believe there's some digital slight-of-hand going on here. I suppose you could lay down any type of video on a Blu-ray disc and call it, \\"Blu-ray,\\" since you're referring to the media not the video. Anyway, this doesn't do 1080P justice. If you're upgrading your movie collection, don't bother with this one. If you've never seen the movie, you should really see it.
B004GYY714|5.0|I'm not sure if I can think of a single thing wrong with this app.  Radio from all over the world! And it play flawlessly.  Must have applied in my book.
B0045NXMJE|4.0|This romp pits a group of subterrean folks-misfits is not really the right word-against well-connected interests in a very unfair world. The gadgetry and Parisian backgrounds (mostly in non-tourist venues) are a rich canvas for the antics, however improbable, of this troup. The characters are mostly believable and well-drawn. The movie's only flaw is that the subtitles are not complete. I can't comment on accuracy since I am not a Francophone. But there are several segments when the characters are singing or speaking and the subtitles are absent. Most subtitling of foreign films for Anglophone audiences is poor quality and it's this kind of carelessness that turns people off from subtitled films they would otherwise enjoy. If this movie were carefully dubbed in English it would have a much wider appeal to Anglophone audiences.
0553579908|5.0|A Clash of Kings picks up right where A Game of Thrones let off, and the story continues with all the pace and plotting of the first book. Excellent read!
B00063EMJ6|5.0|Wow!  \\"Down by the River\\", \\"After the Gold Rush\\" \\"Ohio\\" \\"Heart of Gold\\", and   \\"Old Man\\" just swept me away to another time! 1969-71!!  I loved the other songs as well, but the songs listed are what really attracted me to the CD.  Neil Young rocks!
159420229X|4.0|Fascinating....you will come away from this book ready to dive into this world.  The author makes the reader believe that anyone can learn these methods and he does so in a fun and creative, story-telling way.  Now, don't get the book and expect to have learned everything that he did but it does give the reader a start and some insight into this new (old actually) world.
B00005614N|5.0|As I broadened my taste and experience of music in middle age, this was among the first of my jazz CDs. It seemed like a safe choice at the time. It has proven to be way more than that. The collaboration on this CD and the circumstances of its recording are a solid chunk of jazz history, as are the performers, including the band behind, beneath, and propelling it all. The performances are wonderfully pleasing; the choice of tunes deeply satisfying and, in some cases, revelatory. The music from this CD constantly cycles through my iPod and only on the rarest of occasions will I advance to the next selection (some hours of some days, you're just not In The Mood, you know?). But it is guaranteed to bring a smile every time I listen - like 99% of the time. Go for it; no regrets.
B004BJMEO6|4.0|This is the best recently made movie I have seen at the moment. The story line was beleivable and most people would be able to relate to all the characters in this movie as someone they may know in real life.    The movie dealt with a range of topical issues. They were well portrayed by each character. Most lesbians will also feel deeply connected to Peyton and her cycle of feelings for Elena. The longing and struggles she faces for loving Elena are clear, even without words.    And....what a kiss. Best kiss between lesbians on screen in any movie I have watched. You can almost feel the passion from these women radiating off the screen, red hot. Well made, well acted, GREAT cast.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|If it weren't for the lesbo sex I don't think people would have been talking about this movie so much.  Natalie's character is not very likable nor believable (anyone that fragile would not make it in the competitive world of professional ballet).  Not an original screenplay in terms of themes and I found myself fast forwarding thru quite a bit. Is this movie about someone buckling under the pressure for love, for work, or is she seriously mentally ill?  The movie can't seem to make up its mind.    The music is great though.  Good ol' Tchai really knows how to deliver!
0670022411|2.0|The first 350 pages of this book is like forplay that ends in disappointment. I was really enjoying the book till *****SPOILER ALERT**** the lead characters got together then the whole novel peters out and becomes boring.  I have never read a book with such a stark difference in the middle of a book, its like the author got drunk and finished the book as an after thought or maybe she sobered up when she needed to be drinking to get her inspiration. What the most disappointing thing is at the end of this book,600 pages NOTHING is resolved!!!! REALLY!!!! Talk about being frustrated!!!! Maybe greed made her do this so she would hope people would buy a second installment of the book. What a waste of money!!!!
B004L3AR0K|4.0|Jake Gyllenhal's and Anne Hathaway's performances and charisma made this a great watch for me. They are both compelling and beautiful to watch. I liked the story too, it was different from your standard Rom-Com fare, with Hathaway's character struggling with Parkinson's disease, and Gyllenhal's good-time boy having to grow-up to deal with it. The drug company sub-plot got a little heavy-handed, as did some of the psycho-babble speeches (\\"tell me 4 good things about yourself\\" she says to him at one point - a little too self-help-workshoppy to feel real.) But still a good movie, and certainly a step above your average romantic comedy.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|I like how they package the 4 in one and you really feel like you getting your money worth but you need to use the coupon from the website if still available
0887307280|4.0|I had heard great things about this book.  Although it was interesting and I could pull some great information from it, I did not feel it gave a very broad scenarios.  It seemed to be very wordy with more of a fictional feel to it then reality.  I give it a 4 star because it was well written and was able to gleen wisdom from it.
B004SS0884|2.0|I have been a fan of Britney's work since she burst out onto the scene in the late 90s.  Her first 2 albums were great and set the standard as to what we should expect from the pop princess, but sadly, every album since 'Oops!' has been a step down from its predecessor.  After her meltdown and she went from being the princess of pop to the princess of tabloids, Britney's work has taken a dive.  First was her comeback album \\"Blackout,\\" which was a pretty decent record when compared to \\"Britney\\" and \\"In The Zone,\\" but then something went wrong and her producers were like \\"No--Britney's NEXT album, \\"Circus\\" will ber her true comeback album!\\"  And in a little over a year \\"Circus\\" was released and it was probably her most overhyped album to date, at least until \\"Femme Fatale\\" hit the shelves, which also feels like a comeback album.  The only song on this album that I can even listen to is \\"Hold It Against Me.\\"  I've not even been able to force myself to listen to the entire thing (It took me 2 years to finally be able to listen to all of \\"Circus\\").  She probably has some of the highest paid writers in the business and this is the only crap they can come up with?
B003G4IXA6|4.0|The sound quality overall on this vinyl record is fantastic and very warm. The cd version is brighter and slightly harsh. I sat in front of my stereo in the sweet spot and listened to all 4 sides. It was something that I haven't done in some time. I am a guitarist so I am appreciating Slash's playing and tone more than a casual fan I suppose. My only disappointments were that the album cover was delivered slightly bent in one corner and that the first song on side 4 sounded crackly right out of the package. I have never experienced this on new vinyl. I inspected the record carefully and cannot find any scuffing or visual defects, so I am wondering if the defect is on all pressings.<br /><br />I buy and support any artists that I enjoy that release vinyl pressings. I am very pleased that vinyl is released again and hope that everyone that enjoys the format will continue to make purchases to keep vinyl alive a little longer. I plan on ordering the Van Halen catalog next month. I hear that they sound awesome!
0756405890|3.0|The lead character in this book suffers from quotidian behavior.  As do we all (sigh).  But the author intimates that this lead character, Kvothe, has lived an exceptional life.  A storyteller is taking three full days to transcribe his life story.. doesn't that seem to mean that there is a great life story to tell?<br /><br />I enjoyed the book.  At first I could not put it down.. life with a troup of entertainers, his parents... they are killed by the Chandrian (of which, nothing much for 400 more pages after their dirty deed).  He struggles to survive alone, in woods, and later a city.  He comes to a great school, where his genius in music and magic make his way.  He has a chip on his shoulder, makes enemies, finds love.<br /><br />And the book slows down.  And Kvothe becomes just another putz, unable to articulate his great love.  Rather than Romeo and Juliet, we get Yawnio and Sleepiet.  Even the woman in question notes that Kvothe talks too much, and I would add that the author writes too much, with no payoff.  When a character spends multiple pages looking around town aimlessly for another character, the author has lost his way.<br /><br />But the book is pretty interesting, the strong setting and excellent development carrying the reader through these long, sorta interesting parts.  Sorta interesting... long, but pretty good.<br /><br />What makes this a sad assessment is that after page 200 I thought this would be earth shaking good, not just pretty darn good.  Kvothe's fatal flaw, his arrogance and willingness to be dishonest in the service of what he deems is right... this fatal flaw, which could make for interesting problems, gets swamped by detail and becomes annoying, rather than tragic.<br /><br />By the time the Chandrian are defeated, Kvothe will have spent 1100 pages talking about how he finally kissed the girl, walked around town looking for things, stole his way into the Archives, played a lute to pay for oatmeal, and such.  I bet Frodo had to do lots of annoying every day stuff too (wash his handkerchiefs, buy new waistcoats, brush his hobbit toes).  Life is too short to take Kvothe through each quarterly exam!<br /><br />Wil I read book two?  Maybe, probably, if someone else lends it to me.  I would have purchased this in hard cover after page 200, but now I will wait to steal it from my sister when she gets it.  So, a good book falls a notch short of great.lots of annoying every day stuff too (wash his handkerchiefs, buy new waistcoats, brush his hobbit toes).

B003CRM6QO|4.0|At the time of its initial release, \\"Flash Gordon\\" was a huge flop (except in the UK, where it stands as one of the all-time most popular films). 30+ years later, it has become a camp classic, and this latest Blu-ray version offers the best presentation of this early 80's charmer.<br /><br />Sam J. Jones (recently of \\"Stargate SG-1\\" fame) portrays Flash (although his voice was dubbed), and comes off as the archetypal buff and confident hero of the old-time movie serials. Surrounding him is a host of British screen talent (Timothy Dalton, Topol, Brian Blessed), along with Max von Sydow, whose scenes (especially with Jones) really carry the film.<br /><br />Colors in this newest remastering are vibrant, and the sound mix is good (the classic Queen soundtrack is one of the film's highlights).<br /><br />This film really captures the look of the old 1930's Flash Gordon serials, and the director should be commended for sticking to this vision, despite its apparent commercial limitations.<br /><br />Bonus features are sparse (the UK edition does have a director's commentary).<br /><br />For fans of the film, or of 80's sci-fi, this is a worthwhile upgrade, and it will keep the Flash mythology going forward until the next video format comes along.
0756404738|5.0|OMG!! It was amazing! PLEASE write more as soon as possible. I can't wait for more. Truly one of those most lovable character I know.
0805086846|5.0|In a word, \\"Wow!\\"  I had a hard time putting this book down! It was hard to close the book after finishing it - I wanted to read it again! Needless to say, i started looking for other similar works.  It will challenge you to examine yourself and your beliefs about history, and will most likely change the way you view the history of our country.  It brought me a greater appreciation for \\"the other side of the story\\" when it comes to history, and caused me, in many instances to truly question who was really more \\"civilized\\".  After seeing the \\"Indian Wars\\" from both points of view, I gained a greater understanding of how, many times, both sides fell victim to \\"national responses\\" to the \\"actions of individuals\\",  And how both sides were susceptible to making the same false assumptions or misunderstandings.  I was also greatly impressed by the number of Native Americans that were smarter and wiser than they were given credit for, and I was saddened by the fateful resignation that so many gave into.  It was like they knew that they were fighting a battle they could not win.  This book should be required reading for all US History classes!

0007202288|5.0|I had first read the Narnia books as a young man, then together with my wife a few years ago, and now to my children.<br /><br />These books are special and wonderful and few children's books compare to Lewis' classic.<br /><br />I recently re-read The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and was moved to tears (again!). This book is worth the read at any age. The story is compelling and dramatic. The characters are rich and possess real human dignity. The subtlety and suspense make the book an easy and fast read, yet impossible to forget.<br /><br />Unlike most children's literature, The Chronicles of Narnia--and The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe in particular--treat both the children and adults with respect and grace. The children are young and sometimes impatient, but brave and decent. The adults are respectful and thoughtful, not dismissive or clueless.<br /><br />Lewis' Christianity is clear from start to finish, but this book is not preaching; neither is the content forced. Lewis artfully weaves his plot and characters into the larger narrative of the Christian story. This is book is fantasy, adventure, suspense, mystery, and Gospel.<br /><br />I urge all readers (of any age) to enjoy these books! You will not regret it!
0060751967|2.0|I think the overall concept for this book was cute. A vampire losing a fang and needing a dentist, and a dentist (and vampire love interest) who is afraid of blood. Even how he lost the fang was a pretty funny premise. But after they meet, when Romance's usually take off this one fell apart. Other reviewers summarized the plot, so I won't here. Overall the romance was massively underdeveloped/inexplicable. And the ending just sort of wooshed everything into a quick ending without any real reason for why. I don't know if this is a spoiler, but one \\"bad guy\\" - who is introduced in the last 20% of the book - in the end just sort of shrugs and walks away instead of going on with the conflict he manipulated to occur. I agree with the other readers, this wasn't one I couldn't put down, in fact I did several times. I'll check out the reviews for the subsequent books in the series. But this one was weak. Check out Alexandra Ivy if you want a funny vampire romance series - highly recommend [[ASIN:1420124811 Embrace the Darkness (Guardians of Eternity)]].
B004LFO0O2|5.0|Angles is another great album from The Strokes, this time showcasing more of the rest of the band's song writing capabilities. Every song is different from one another, they're all good. Songs like Macchu Picchu and Under The Cover of Darkness are very easy to get into and sing along to, however others like Metabolism and Taken For A Fool take a couple listens or so to get the feel of. Two of my favorites are the electronically haunting Games and sweet and gloomy Call Me Back.    This is definitely an awesome album, just don't go in expecting the same old Strokes from back in 2001. They've moved onto something new and something equally as good.
B004289ZW0|4.0|I have tried using this on an iPad, PC, and Android.  Its accuracy is pretty good and is within 2 meters most of the time.  I am primarily using it out in the country and it might be susceptable to scatter in urban environments.    The iPad, which is why I bought it, links up instantly and works right away.    The PC for some reason won't lock in bluetooth mode, but if you connect it via USB it will read the NMEA data being transferred.    The Android device doesn't want to link up and sees it as a bluetooth audio device.  I am sure it would work if I could get the proper bluetooth profile, but I haven't dug into it enough on this platform to make it work though.
B001FAZYOQ|5.0|This CD was much better than I expected, because I've never heard a great live Bowie album before. The difference here is this release has just the right amount of rawness. Mick Ronson sounds incredible throughout and Bowie is in very fine voice. The harmonies are great and the mistakes make it all seem very real. Ronson wails on the 10 minute \\"The Width Of A Circle\\" and Bowie does an excellent tribute to Lou Reed with \\"Waiting For The Man\\". A nice added touch was when Bowie had to vocally recreate the sound effects of \\"Space Oddity\\" due to limited technology back in 1972. \\"Space Oddity also began a very nice acoustic set in the middle of the concert along with \\"Andy Warhol\\" and \\"My Death\\". There are many highlights, but probably the best was the encore...\\"Rock N Roll Suicide\\". I highly recommend this CD!
B0034G4P7G|4.0|It took me a while to finally get around to watching The Social Network. It's award nominated and the critics mostly loved it. So what took me so long? Well, watching how Facebook got started just didn't seem that compelling to me, but ultimately the movie was fascinating.<br /><br />Jesse Eisenberg is a great pick to play Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Whether or not the portrayal is accurate I have no idea. But as far as I'm concerned, by the end of the movie I felt like I knew Zuckerberg personally and I felt like I tagged along with him while he went from Harvard genius to Facebook Founder & CEO. Kudos to Director David Fincher as well for taking a potential bore fest and turning out one of the best movies that I've seen this year.<br /><br />I think a common misconception is that guys like Zuckerberg are \\"lucky\\". As in, \\"Man, why didn't I think of Facebook\\" lucky. Like if you thought of it first you'd be a billionaire. If you had any illusions (or should I say delusions) that simply coming up with the idea first would have made you rich, you will not be so confident after watching this movie. Zuckerberg was/is a computer savvy, cut-throat entrepreneur that makes Donald Trump look obsolete.<br /><br />I had no idea that one of the creators of Napster was involved in making Facebook succeed. However, while Shawn Fanning is renowned as THE Napster creator, he is not the character played by Justin Timberlake in the movie. Timberlake plays Sean Parker who indeed was one of the Napster pioneers along with Fanning. So just in case you were wondering, there's my trivia moment for this review.<br /><br />Great stuff in The Social Network. It's genuinely interesting even for a guy like me that does not even have a Facebook page.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I finished this book because it was given to me as a gift - but it was a struggle.  There is not a single compelling character in the book.  The two main characters are either boring or obnoxious.  The story is trite - another reviewer said \\" it's Romeo and Juliet all over again\\" It was the same plot but with poor writing, no story, and a lot of pages.  I know the supernatural and vampires are the flavor of the month, but don't waste your time on this one.
B002DMJL9E|5.0|I have always LOVED this movie and now that it's in Blu Ray is all the better. This is the BEST of the 48hr series. The Blu Ray tranfer is excellent being that the movie is well over 20+ yeras old.
B00005TQKQ|5.0|The Sony V825CLD 8MM camcorder head cleaner saved the day.  I just shot a friend's wedding and was transferring the video to DVD when the picture turned to snow.

If you still own an 8mm device I strongly recommend grabbing one of these while you still can.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book tells it like it is.  It's not pretty, it's not a \\"happy\\" story and some may shy from some of the not so polite language however, it is still a book I think all Americans should take the time to read, especially anyone who has an \\"opinion\\" on the war in Afghanistan, our military and how it should operate ....especially anyone who is basing their opinion on what they hear in the regular  media.    Even with the language, I think it should be on all American HS and College reading lists.  The book is well written, easy to read, heart wrenching, honest, informative and inspiring.  If anyone wants to start a discussion on pros and cons of our military, how it should be run and what soldiers should or shouldn't do in the battlefield; if they are not experienced, I'm going to tell them to read this book before I even begin to carry on that conversation with them.

B002G1YPH0|3.0|I liked this heatsink for in those very hot rooms and other environments. HOWEVER!    Its size makes it limited to full size cases ONLY, otherwise it will be too tall to fit inside.  It has only ONE direction, so make sure your case has a top exhaust fan for it to direct itself to, otherwise you'll be venting the CPU heat into a top mounted power supply. I would prefer if this was redesigned so it can be mounted in any direction so it can be aimed at the rear exhaust. Also because of its facing, for those annoying cases that are backwards, it will end up venting into the video card from the bottom, again the need for it to vent out the rear.    So great for very hot locations, but the two downfalls of SIZE and FACING.    Jim.
B003Y5H4SO|3.0|If you thought a movie set in a phoneboof was a strange idea, here comes one about a group of people stuck in an elevator amongst the presence of the Devil. The movie kicks off with a suicide of someone jumping out of a sky-rise building window to their death. From where the person jumped from is the building that contains an elevator that has stopped in its tracks, and maintenance and security can't seem to find what's wrong with it to get it going again and free the 5 people stuck inside of it. However, one of these people happens to be Satan, and along the way you can bet blood will be spilled. The entire movie is not set within the elevator tho, there is outside communication with security and the superstitious religious man who helps explain to the audience what is supposedly happening, as well as a couple of Philadelphia defectives and a bunch of other people around the building area, so the whole movie is not just set in a claustrophobic small room.    The premises of the thing is pretty much what you would guess it to be, it's a \\"which of them is the devil\\"? sort of slight mystery, and the outcome is not all that highly predictable, as my girlfriend and I where betting on who it would turn out to be, she may have guessed it correctly, but that comes down to you have a choice of about 5 people to guess from, or think outside of the box.    Overall, it's not a bad movie, but I really don't think it's one to watch again once you know the outcome. I wouldn't really recommend you buy the movie unless you have reason to really want to, it's really just a decent rental, that you should be satisfied with, but yeah, to watch it again, I don't think there is much replay value.

B0038BBA4I|5.0|Amazing!  They are fantastic!  It might be because I listened to them incesantly while going through a relationship trial, but either way their lyrics speak to me and their music lights a fire in me.  Cheesy? Maybe, but it is the only way I know to describe what I feel.       They have such rich sounds made by their stand-up bass, accordian and their other instruments that are unique for such a young group.  Buy it now!!

B0019CB5T8|5.0|The Exorcism of Emily Rose evokes the best of a psychological horror movie in the format of a court room drama. At war are two sides of America (though the events on which this tragic story is very loosely based occurred in Germany) - The fundamentalist Christian America sincerely believes in demon possession as described in the Bible, versus the scientifically minded America that looks to natural explanations for mental disorders. Beyond that this is a great story with excellent acting and spooky cinematography without resorting to shock and gore. Highly recommended as long as you aren't expecting another Exorcist sequel.  In a way, this is a very scary movie, though not in the same way as the Exorcist or a slash film.  (It's interesting to notice that different reviewers do not agree on whether the movie favors the scientific interpretation of events or the spiritual interpretation. I believe the film makers have left it up to the viewer.)
0385342047|3.0|Sophie Kinsella writing style is still as funny as ever as she weaves her latest Shopaholic book. While the conflict in this book is probably the silliest one yet, it still is fun. While reading it, I still would stopped and think of how extreme Becky was acting and that the relationships in the book seemed somewhat far-fetched at times, like Becky having all of these connections that work out--ie Tarkie and Danny..etc.. While Luke I thought in this book was more himself, I still could not imagine Luke Brandon allowing himself to live with Becky's parents, but he seemed more like Luke from the earlier books rather than the last two books. Becky is back to her usual tricks of lying and hiding--and describing clothes we can all only dream of! Kinsella's book is a reliving book for any shopaholic looking for a break that won't break the bank! I still do not think this book is as good as Shopaholic and Sister, but better than Shopaholic and Baby. Enjoy!
1400052181|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot is a story long overdue.  In parts, it was fascinating, heartbreaking, outrageous and frightening--but ultimately uplifting.  Skloot's book is actually several different stories, and she weaves them together seamlessly.  There is the story of Henrietta Lacks, her family, her cells and the ethics involved in medical research.<br /><br />Henrietta Lacks was a 30 year-old black woman when she was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1951.  Living in Baltimore with her husband and 5 children, she sought treatment at Johns Hopkins University Hospital.  She died 9 months later.  Before her death, her doctor took samples of her cells--both normal and cancerous.  The cells were given to Hopkins researcher, Dr. George O. Gey.  Gey was not only able to keep the cancerous cells alive, but they actually started reproducing--the first time this was seen in human cells.  Gey was generous with these cells and before long, researchers from all over the world were using Henrietta's cells (now called HeLa) for research.  Many scientists claim that HeLa cells were the most important medical breakthrough in the 20th Century.<br /><br />Over the years, HeLa cells \\"helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, and Parkinson's disease; and they've been used to study lactose digestion, sexually transmitted diseases, appendicitis, human longevity, mosquito mating, and the negative cellular effects of working in sewers.\\"  They've been exposed to radiation, and used to test \\"steroids, chemotherapy drugs, hormones, vitamins, and environmental stress...\\"  They've been sent into space and used to test cosmetics.  They've been used to study genetics, they've been cloned, and they were used to create hybrids.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office lists over 17,000 patents using HeLa.  Today, HeLa cells have evolved into a multibillion dollar business.<br /><br />It wasn't until over 20 years after Henrietta's death that her family became aware that her cells were still alive, being used for research and making companies lots of money.  When the author was 16, her science teacher introduced Skloot to Henrietta Lacks and her cells, although he didn't know much about Henrietta.  So Skloot decided that Henrietta's story needed to be told.  But Henrietta's family had major reservations about Skloot and her motives and at first, refused to work with her.  \\"It's not only the story of HeLa cells and Henrietta Lacks, but of Henrietta's family--particularly Deborah [daughter]--and their lifelong struggle to make peace with the existence of those cells, and the science that made them possible.\\"  It also seems terribly wrong to them that while many have become rich off their mother, they are poor, uninsured, and can't afford the drugs that were most likely created using HeLa cells.<br /><br />The Immortal Life also deals with medical ethics, consent, medical experiments on humans, cell ownership, and who has a right to profit from your cells.  The tissues taken from Henrietta were taken without her consent.  Some of her cancer cells were injected into unknowing patients in medical experiments.  There have been gains made over the years to protect patients, but there is always a battle between patients and researchers when changes are proposed.<br /><br />The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a book that will haunt you long after you're done.

0890090572|5.0|In the very first review here on Amazon, \\"customer\\" describes the various merits of this particular edition of Sherlock Holmes' stories; I won't repeat his excellent comments.<br /><br />Instead I'll talk about these most entertaining novels and stories from one the great writers of detective fiction.  From our first encounter with Holmes in Conan Doyle's introductory novel, A Study in Scarlet, we are fascinated by the uniqueness of Sherlock Holmes's eccentric personality, his incredible intelligence in all thing related to crime and its detection, his total dedication to his craft and his constant research into the smallest details concerning the criminal mind and behavior, and the enormous resources of energy and determination he calls on to solve problems that frustrate and baffle Scotland Yard.<br /><br />Holmes is a consulting detective; that is, he is the man police and private citizens turn to when normal agencies of the law are baffled by seemingly inexplicable criminal behavior.  What makes Holmes special is not only his vast knowledge concerning crime and criminals, but also his incredible powers of observation and deduction, which he uses in every story to the amazement of Dr. Watson, his good friend and helper, and the various detectives of Scotland Yard who come seeking his help.<br /><br />Conan Doyle is a fine writer who wanted to turn his attention to other literary projects and so he decided that Holmes would die at the Reichbach falls in a final meeting with arch enemy Professor Moriarty -- The Adventure of the Final Problem.  Fortunately for us, the reading public would not accept the death of their favorite detective and put pressure on Conan Doyle to write a final volume of stories about the greatest detective in literature.<br /><br />Many years ago PBS Mystery televised many of the great stories with Jeremy Brett, now sadly deceased, as the definitive Sherlock Holmes.  Readers who loves the stories in The Original Sherlock Holmes are almost certain to enjoy Brett's portrayal of the master detective in DVD's available on Amazon.  Highly recommended.of the master detective in DVD's available on Amazon.  Highly recommended.
B002IFT1ZA|4.0|Please note: As of thiis date, May 17, it turns out that I haven't been able to do weekly updates, primarily because this review would become unwieldy. I think you'll find that the descriptions of the episodes included here should be enough to decide whether this is worth watching. My conclusion? Yes, although I'm finding significant differences in the apparent ages and characterizations of some of the people - compared to the book.<br /><br />When I started this review, only the first episode had aired and I've continued to update this review - up to a point - and plan to do a summary of the overall series eventually.<br /><br /> This series is based on the first of four books in the George RR. Martin series, Game of Thrones. Other titles are A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, A Feast for Crows, etc (see link below). The corruption and betrayal that will ensue between the Stark and Lannister families is obvious - although the full details are, of course, yet to be revealed. Movie adaptations of books have their pros and cons and this series - so far- is no exception. Clearly, plenty of money has been spent to create a realistic sense of the time and place. You can almost feel the chill in the air and the sense of danger is palpable from the start. It does not take long for graphic violence and sex to appear.<br /><br />After seeing the first episode, I went back and reread part of the book and that episode did stay true to the events in the book that were covered so far. For those unfamiliar with the book, it could be confusing to keep track of the various families. Also, the television version is quite graphic when it comes to sexuality and violence. This is not a family friendly series but then...would anyone familiar with the books expect it to be?<br /><br />The setting and political intrigues between the various noble families is clear. The tight script and editing made the sex scenes stand out while the depth of the novel and character descriptions took second place. But the first episode was still very riveting and I'm eager to see how the series progresses.  [[ASIN:0345529057 George R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones 4-Book Boxed Set: A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, and A Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire)]].<br /><br />Update: As the series proceeds, as might be expected, tensions increase and loyalties are tested. Young Bran remains in a coma, with his life hanging in the balance. By the end of the latest episode (thus far), keep an eye on Bran. Again, plenty of graphic nudity combined with cruelty. And of course details from the book have either been tightened or eliminated (how on earth could a series capture the vivid descriptions of the author?) So I've downgraded my expectations somewhat.<br /><br />Kudos do have to go to the producers and directors of the HBO series for allowing each character to be introduced and evolve, perhaps a major aid to those unfamiliar with the book.<br /><br />But back to the series....Jon Snow, the \\"bastard son\\" is off to join the Night's Watch. Ned also leaves while Dany (Daenerys) is taught the sexual techniques which she hopes will please her new husband. There are hints that their relationship has the potential to grow deeper, although that is far from certain as the episode ends. Because I'm working hard not to include too many spoilers, I'll only add that some viewers may find at least one death in this episode to be distressing while another is not unexpected.<br /><br />Catelyn continues to reject Jon as she remains by Bran's side. But she can't prevent Jon from showing his affection for Bran before he leaves. The teenager, Joffrey, appears to be wooing Sansa Stark successfully - until they run into Anya, fencing with the butcher's boy. Joffrey bullies and taunts the boy and things come to a distressing climax (again, trying to prevent spoilers). Meanwhile, the direwolfs are proving to be more than just pets, with far greater insight and power than imagined. There is a very touching scene involving one of them as well as a painful event with another.<br /><br />At several points, the Dragon's Eggs are shown, building momentum. This time around, I watched with a friend who hadn't read the book. He was completely hooked by the end of the episode. Again, would love to hear others' take on the show so far. These are only brief recaps of each episode and I can't include every crucial plot development or this review will soon become far too long. I hope I've included enough to intrigue you.ne of them as well as a painful event with another.     At several points, the Dragon's Eggs are shown, building momentum.

B000067CPX|2.0|I am a consummate RHCP fan.  May not have been born one, but I am gonna die a fan.  However, my attempts to like this CD have fallen flat.  I am willing to give the Chili Peppers the benefit of the doubt; as I understand that it is necessary to branch out and try new things.  But since when does that mean they have to bore us, their fans and audience?<br /><br />This album is what happens when one of the band members, Frusciante, is hyped to the skies for his genius, and forgets that he is actually in a band with three other people.  Often I have heard people say, \\"Thank God for John Frusciante.\\" Look, the man is a great musician, but that doesn't mean that his forays into the pop idiom are great ideas.  It's like Frusciante suddenly discovered that songs have harmonies and melodies; I'm thinking, great! I am so glad you've learned to appreciate and write melodies, but please stop using this new found knowledge to bore us fans to death.<br /><br />There is only one noteworthy song on this CD, the gorgeous \\"Midnight.\\"  Honestly, I have forgotten the rest of the songs as soon as I hit the EJECT button on my CD player.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour, people, go buy Uplift Mofo Party Plan or Blood Sugar Sex Magick if you want to hear the Chili Peppers before they decided to let John Frusciante run everything into the ground.
0670022411|1.0|The author of this book had a simple plot line, a romance story. Not really about witches and vampires, more about unobtainable love.    Instead of following it, she introduced needless characters, brought out many, many unfinished conflicts, and in the end never resolved the mystery of Ashmore 782. It was a damn shame because this book is 579 pages of bad writing.    Don't read it!
B004G6009U|5.0|I tried to resist \\"Tangled\\", I really did. I've been entertained but somewhat underwhelmed by Disney's animated films for at least ten years or so. I found Disney's marketing campaign for this film somewhat annoying, especially their unwillingness to title the film \\"Rapunzel\\". I was very angry at Disney for changing from hand-drawn animation to (mostly) computer animation. There are other things, but I'll stop there. Needless to say, I was at Defcon 2 when the lights went down for \\"Tangled\\", ready to see yet another example of Disney losing its magic. Well, I was wrong. I love this movie. This may be my favorite Disney movie since \\"Beauty and the Beast\\". I apologize for the cynicism, Disney. \\"Tangled\\" is simply magical!<br /><br />Where do I start? The animation is absolutely glorious! The backgrounds are so lush and beautiful, the characters are so vibrant and expressive. Every facial expression (well, HUMAN facial expressions - I don't think I'm in a position to comment on the accuracy of Pascal the chameleon's facial expressions) is absolutely convincing. Look into the eyes of Rapunzel or Flynn at any scene in the movie and you see their emotions reflected there perfectly. I know the eyes are the window to the soul and therefore critical to making an animated character seem alive, but the animators have outdone themselves (and everyone else) this time. And don't get me started on Rapunzel's hair! Amazing!<br /><br />The story is terrific, too - I can't remember the last time I laughed so much in a Disney film. Rapunzel is spunky and adorable, Flynn Rider is a sarcastic thief with (of course) a heart of gold, a hilarious horse named Maximus, a pub full of comic ruffians, a suitably sinister villain named Mother Gothel-  all great stuff! The romantic development in Rapunzel and Flynn's relationship is done extremely well, too, and never feels forced. We all know it's going to end happily, but getting there is such a joy in \\"Tangled\\"!<br /><br />\\"Tangled\\" seems to have been somewhat overlooked (though it was still a half-billion dollar success worldwide) when in theatres last fall, and so I really hope that it finds the audience it deserves on Blu Ray and DVD. Disney has returned to form and made a tremendously entertaining fairy tale musical. If you have not seen \\"Tangled\\", then I dearly hope that I have convinced you to give it a chance. You will not be disappointed.oked (though it was still a half-billion dollar success worldwide) when in theatres last fall, and so I really hope that it finds the audience it deserves on Blu Ray and DVD.

B004SBX112|5.0|Finally the update is out for this great game. Rovio (the app maker) took the blame for it being delayed. However the lack of communication from amazon app store was horrible. The amazon app store has its own twitter feed and they can't even update that or put a note on their home page.  Also Amazon customer service rep. had no info. about why the update was missing or late and when it would be on amazon - useless. I will say that I order books and other stuff from amazon without any problems it is just their app store that sucks! Rovio did a great job of apologizing and keeping in touch with everyone through their twitter feed so thanks for that too!
B00000JQ0E|1.0|I love the songs as you can hear them on the CD. Beware of listening to the vinyl on a good HiFi rig, however, because it's awful. It's compressed, oversaturated, and just sounds awful.    To be honest it's the same as Led Zeppelin on vinyl......love the songs, but the vinyl version either points out how terrible the recordings were made, or some other limitation in the process.    Boo to Amazon for not differentiating the medium as the reviews are recorded (I doubt that 875 people reviewed the vinyl version). I would give the songs 4.5 stars but the vinyl 0 stars if it were possible.
B004SS0884|5.0|Britney has given us another top notch album. Britney is no longer involved in her creations. She does not dance, does not sing, does not give interviews and has not penned any of the tracks on this Cd.    Even though I am upset we have lost her I can not deny that this album is amazing.   Every track (including bonus tracks) can be listened to straight through repeatedly.     The songs are fun and make you want \\"go-o-o-o\\" out somewhere and party.     Soon to be Massive Singles:  INSIDE OUT  I WANNA GO  UP and DOWN   SEAL IT WITH A KISS      If possible I would give more stars. This CD will be a classic forever.
B00382X4XC|4.0|First - I am a devoted fan of the Dio-era Sabbath stuff. When I learned that the Heaven and Hell title was going to get the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" treatment I was overjoyed. The remaster job sounds great (not that it needed much improvement!) so, Here's my beef with the project: I was disappointed with the content of the bonus cd. Of the 7 tracks there are 2 \\"live\\" Heaven and Hell, and 2 \\"live\\" Children of the Sea, both sub-par recordings. When the \\"Deluxe Editions\\" started appearing a couple or three years ago, it was a ggreat idea - classic albums being given the special treatment, the remaster job, the bonus material - but somewhere along the way the labels started thinking \\"just grab a bunch of anything you can find and throw it on a second disc - they're buying these Deluxe Editions like crazy!\\" So what should be put on the bonus disc, you might ask? Songs that were recorded during the session and not used for the album, alternate versions with different arrangements or different lyrics or lead solos (The Alice Cooper box set offers a LOT of this, and so do the Roger Glover remixes of the Deep Purple Anniversary editions of Machine Head, Fireball, and In Rock - TOTALLY worth it). The bonus material  for \\"Eternal Idol\\" was awesome: the original session with Ray Gillen singing before Tony Martin replaced him and re-recorded the vocals, as was \\"Seventh Star\\": bonus disc was a live show with Ray Gillen singing before abruptly leaving the band. THAT's good collectible stuff. The labels are getting lazy and just churning stuff out there to turn a quick buck because the earlier Deluxe endeavors went over so good. I'm afraid that is what happened here with one of the greatest albums of the genre. I have this Deluxe Edition and am glad i do, but only because it is the Dio-fronted Black Sabbath masterpiece known as Heaven and Hell. And it was a masterpiece BEFORE the Deluxe Edition. Get with the program record labels... we WON'T keep buying your expensive mediocrity. Wanna do something we can appreciate? Release the Hammersmith Odeon show in it's entirety....THAT would be impressive and worthy of RJD and his memory!something we can appreciate?

0307595862|5.0|I'm a big fan of Jo Nesbo and I found The Snowman to be the best book in the series so far.<br /><br />Since so many others have summed up the book so well, I'll just say that this is one scary, shivery read. I love Harry Hole, the wounded hero, and find his struggle with his personal demons as compelling as his search for the killer. I also loved that the book kept me guessing. Just when I thought I had it all figured out, I found out I was wrong. This kept me turning the pages as quickly as possible, definitely a page-turner for me.<br /><br />The Snowman is not a book for the faint-hearted, so cozy mystery readers beware, this is not the book for you. Thriller readers will definitely love it, though. It's chilling and guaranteed to send a shiver down your spine--even if it's 90 degrees outside. I loved every tension-filled, scary moment.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next book in the series. For me, this is the ultimate compliment I can give an author. Please keep them coming!

B0015RFCZ0|5.0|I've seen this movie 5 or 6 times. I absolutely love it. If you have an ounce of creativity in your being, you will love this movie too. The storyline is amazing.<br /><br />A young orphan boy tries to find his parents. He ends up lost/homeless on the street. He is taken in by a pied-piper of young street musicians, who lives in a run down abandoned building. His parents had a love-at-1st-sight experience, but were pulled in different directions. I won't give the storyline away, but his mom didn't know he was alive. His dad never knew he existed. The boy knew that his mom and dad loved him and were trying to find him. He felt the only way he could find them was to create music so that they could hear it...and then they would find him.<br /><br />I really appreciate how this movie takes you through several different levels of art/music: amateur, sophisticated,  orchestra, rock, blues, self-taught, refined, gritty street, gospel, etc.<br /><br />Parents: I don't feel that there are any more \\"rated R\\" moments in this movie than you might come across while watching a typical prime time show on TV. The artistic and emotional value of this movie is great enough to allow your tween/teen to watch.

B00498YZH8|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I rented this movie. I find a variety of genres interesting and I try to keep an open mind.<br /><br />This movie is very gritty and hard to watch from start to finish. It is not a simple, typical story about backwoods redneck bumpkins. It has a very interesting story line. The teen doesn't have time to worry about herself - she has less than a week to find her felon father or lose the shack that she lives in with her younger siblings and mentally ill mother. She goes through several situations that a man should be dealing with, but she has no one to help her. You won't get any satisfaction in the end - there is no real happy ending. She is never rescued or comforted by a love interest.  I liked the movie because I felt like I was watching something real...it wasn't sugar-coated. There are a couple of disturbing violent/morbid events. Forget all of the typical stories about rednecks living a hard life, smoking cigarettes, sleeping around, etc. These people are one gene above wild animals. They only have two speeds: #1. What's in it for me and #2. Anger. I thought this was a very well-written script, great acting by all, and great directing.<br /><br />If you'd like to watch a movie that will take you from the emotional lows of a hard life to highs of triumph, watch \\"In the Pursuit of Happiness\\".
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|I'll get the one major negative about this book out of the way first: it sorta beats the reader over the head with anecdotal evidence about its topic. Someone needs to tell the author that the plural of \\"anecdote\\" is not \\"data\\". Fortunately, it ALSO extensively cites published scientific studies and reputable professionals.     The book consists of two parts, which correspond to its title. The first part is about why we get fat. It provides extensive discussion of two primary points: that excessive consumption of carbohydrates is the cause of fatness, and that losing weight by counting calories and exercising doesn't really work very well at taking off or (especially) keeping off the fat. (As any fat person can attest.)     The second part was most interesting to me: what to do about it. It begins with a relatively extensive but quite readable discussion of how the body burns and stores the nutrition it gets from food. This is very important to understanding the rest of the book. It's also very informative - my doctor has been talking to me about things like HDL and LDL choleterol, or triglicerides, and almost all I knew about them was that he told me they were good or bad and gave me some numbers. After reading this book I understand what they are, what they do, and WHY they're good or bad, which helps me to take control of my health.    It then discusses, in terms of what the reader just learned about their body, the biochemical mechanism of what causes people to gain fat and lose fat, demonstrating WHY carbohydrates make us fat, and what other negative health consequences come from eating too much carbohydrates - including diabetes, high blood pressure, high bad cholesterol, low good cholesterol, gout, and increased chances of heart attacks and cancer.    The book then proposes a solution - a diet based primarily around eating meat. (It explains that vegetables can be fine too, and that different people can eat different amounts of carbohydrates while losing, orat least not gaining, fat, but these are incidental and not the primary topic of the book.) It then examines what the implications of this proposed diet are biochemically to demonstrate how it works, and then it discusses the health implications of this proposed diet to show that a diet consisting primarily of fatty meat (the book is very clear that eating nothing but lean meat is unhealthy, and that fat is required) can be surprisingly healthy.     It also examines the question of how, if we know that the standard \\"count calories and exercise\\" diet doesn't really work, some people lose weight that way. It argues that they lose weight because in reducing their overall calories they are also reducing their carbohydrate intake, and losing weight because of that, not because of the starvation and exercise they are torturing themselves with. The implication is that a reduced carbohydrate diet is actually the ONLY way to lose fat, and that calorie-counting diets only actually work if (and because) they approximate a reduced carbohydrate diet.    I found this book to be simultaneously helpful and disturbing. It's helpful because it significantly contributes to my understanding of my own health and my ability to make informed decisions about my diet. It's disturbing because it plainly shows that most of what we're taught, and indeed most of what I've been taught all of my life, about nutrition is plainly wrong, and the truth is almost completely opposite. There's a brief part in the book that both made me laugh and really shook me in which the author carefully lays out (apparently as an extreme example to demonstrate his case) why we would be healthier if we replaced all the carbohydrates in our diet with an equal amount of lard.    I'm recommending this book to all of my loved ones and urging them to please read it right away.
B004WMKSH2|4.0|This is a typical Harry Potter movie. If you've seen the others this one falls right in line. Of course, the storyline has matured along with the actors.<br /><br />The Harry Potter series is all about dark, mysterious, magical things. Hence, some of the scenes in this movie are in the dark woods, in dark castles, etc. The scenes are not bad, too dark, etc. It's suppose to be that way. It falls right in with the script/storyline. Some of the sound effects do drown out the speech and you can't hear what's being said, but you get the gist. This movie is fast-paced, and is full of action and mystery. You get more info about the characters, and there are a few new elements. I enjoyed the background story about the Deathly Hallow men. The characters warping in and out reminds me of \\"Inception\\", but it works well.<br /><br />This movie has a bit more violence, sensuality, tragedy, and death than the others did. I wouldn't let young children watch this one - it might be a bit disturbing for them. There is also alot going on - they may have a hard time understanding what is happening.

B004L3AR0K|2.0|I rented this movie because I had heard good things about it in the media. But it was a sad disappointment. While the story had potential for deep character development, the movie failed utterly to do so. Instead, it was plagued with superficiality. The director seemed more interested in the over-abundance of sex scenes (just add some cheesy music, and this  movie easily becomes soft-porn) than with the lives of his characters outside the bedroom.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I have been a very casual fan of the Foo Fighters for years. I've always loved their singles and a few other random album tracks, but by and large, I have always thought that their previous albums always contained a lot of 'filler.' I always thought Grohl has great talents for writing a memorable, rockin' song...it's just that usually the full albums weren't as consistent as a lot of other bands I love. I'd have to say, they have finally done it - Wasting Light is a solid album all the way through. Every single song is solid and memorable. This is above and beyond their best and most consistent album of their career thus far. Great album, and I recommend it for any rock fan! Love the big warm production, too. Much respect for recording to tape...though the mastering for the CD is a bit louder/more limited dynamically than it probably should have been...still sounds great!

B001PB3RU8|4.0|I am all for earth-mamas getting their Kate Bush on, and \\"Lungs\\" is one of the better efforts in that style. Florence Welch has the kind of power Neko Case delivers, along with the mystical feel sometimes displayed by Lilith Faire types like Sarah McLaughlin. And like Kate Bush or Sin&eacute;ad O'Connor, there are those indescribable moments that quirk \\"Lungs\\" into areas you wouldn't expect it to go.<br /><br />The initial attraction has been \\"Dog Days are Over,\\" a forceful declaration of emancipation that has a universal resonance to it. With Welch's booming voice raging atop a aggressive track, \\"Dog Days\\" is pretty near irresistible. Yet there's no way that the single prepares you for the strangely punky \\"Kiss With a Fist\\" or the booming blues mayhem of \\"Girl With One Eye.\\" Welch sings everything with a flamethrower intensity that sometimes makes the album a bit too monochromatic vocally, but when you get her snarling out a lyric (from \\"Hurricane Drunk\\") that goes \\"I'm going out, I'm gonna drink myself to death\\" or she tones the firepower down a touch on \\"Between Two Lungs,\\" you get the feeling that Florence and The Machine might have some staying power.

0810982862|2.0|I think that, honestly, this book doesn't show the design process for Avatar. It only shows the final selections of designs and it does it in very superficial way, I mean, how many drawings and designs the artist should have developed to achieve the final results.   I expected to see tons of drawings, maquettes, 3d models, sculptures and all that I found was some digital matte paintings all of the landscapes of Pandora (the planet of the story).  I bet this movie had a greater artistic process that the one shown in this book. Its a pity  we will have to imagine it.
B004EPYZP8|4.0|The film critics I've read have done an unusually good job discussing The Lincoln Lawyer, as I saw it.  I will just hit the main points about the movie, pro and con, that made an impression on me.  Overall, I thought the movie was well-acted, well-produced, and entertaining, even if limited by what might be called a good TV-caliber screenplay.    The movie drew me in at the very start when the Lincoln town car of the title and its driver turned out not to be the phony Hollywood glitz I had expected but a seedy image that fit the movie perfectly.  (One amateur review's complaint that the car somehow failed to serve its purpose simply because the title character drove around in other vehicles at various points is silly.)  The well-acted characters and unusually dingy L.A. settings generally felt authentic, as far as they went.  Matthew McConaughey fit naturally, smoothly, and effectively into the lead character of Mick Haller.  Haller is a slick, shady L.A. criminal defense lawyer who gets results for his low-life clients, even if things do not always turn out for the best.  Haller runs into serious problems, suffers blows from them, does not act always and mindlessly cocky (unlike the annoying, one-note young prosecutor-on-the-make in the movie Fracture), yet draws on enough strength, ingenuity, and resourcefulness that his confidence rarely fails him.  This made him fun to watch.  Sometimes, he stepped over the line, but not so far as to throw believability to the winds.  The story was basically interesting and tied up fairly neatly.  In fact, it is quite an accomplishment to make a mystery thriller that was generally this entertaining and satisfying without going completely over the top, the way so many of these kind of movies do (such as The Firm, Final Analysis, Just Cause, Guilty as Sin, General's Daughter, and the Ashley Judd films Double Jeopardy and High Crimes).  Lincoln Lawyer was refreshingly free of exploitative, sensational scenes used to gin up cheap shock value, horror, suspense, or titillation.    At the same time, I have to agree with the critics that the movie's story and characters do seem familiar.  Although workmanlike, including the courtroom scenes, well-handled by McConaughey, the movie lacked the sparks of imagination, originality, intricacy, and electricity that can sometimes come from films like this.  It did not really hit the high notes that make watching not just enjoyable but exciting.  The writing, while good, seemed more like a script for a high-quality TV show than theatrical film.  And some of the supporting characters, especially Haller's ex-wife and the bail bondsman, were badly under-developed and pasted on, wasting talented actors in nothing or contrived roles.  Haller's interactions with his ex-wife were not convincing.  Similarly unconvincing was the degree to which he felt a crisis of conscience about the way he represented a past client in light of newly discovered information from representing his current, rich-boy client, accused of trying to beat to death a woman he met at a bar.  Haller had more practical and selfish reasons for resolving the current case the way he did, without delving so deeply into soul-searching and noble motives, which seemed ill-suited to the rest of the movie.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I absolutely love the Kindle app ever since I first got on my old iPod and now that I have it on my Mesmerize, I love it even more. Kindle makes it easier to get books without having to go to a bookstore. My only gripe is that I wish Amazon had a Kindle option for every book that they offer.

B00000373U|5.0|It has been seven years since Elliott's supposed suicide, an event that has propelled him to mythical heights with fans. Elliott released five full length albums, the third being Either/Or. This is the final of his lo-fi acoustic albums and is regarded as the pinnacle of his songwriting. His transparently thin voice has plenty of room to travel and isn't suppressed by the claustrophobia of heavy instrumentation. The lyrics are raw and revealing, devoid of diluted dreams and sentiment, providing an accurate depiction of contemporary love and loss. In the late night alcohol influenced ballad \\"Between the Bars,\\" Elliott sings \\"Drink up baby, stay up all night/ With the things you could do, you won't but you might.\\" Elliott's mastery of the acoustic guitar is evident in the inventive chord structures and progressions throughout the album. His considerate strumming carries the melodic vocals and contributes to the seamless transitions between thematically diverse tracks. Alongside his Oscar nominated track \\"Miss Misery,\\" many songs from Either/Or were included in the Good Will Hunting soundtrack.
0060936223|5.0|Patty Smith the \\"Godmother of Punk\\" can write?  Oh can she!  This is not only one of the most honesty memoirs I have read in a long time but it is a roller coaster ride from heartbreak to joy as you turn each page.  It is a poignant love story, an inner look at an artist's inner emotional life, and one of the best books I have read about what it really meant to grow up in the sixties. I know because like Ms. Smith, I did so.  This is not just another self-confessional about sex, drugs, and rock & roll by some ex-rocker that already litter the bookstores and newsstands.  This is a thoughtful, thought-provoking, and almost poetic look at love and life from one who experienced both to the fullest.
0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell's book, Outliers, is a fascinating assessment into the way we think about success. Entering into the book, I fiddled with the question: Is success netted or predetermined? After reading Gladwell's many arguments, I was left with a conclusion fitting for me, and after discussing my findings with others, who have read this book, it became clear Gladwell masterfully calculated his writing style and voice to speak and relate to one and all in a \\"made-to-order\\" fashion. A rhetorical strategy seldom used but exceptionally effective. Chapter by chapter, I was engrossed into his usage of statistics and logic, quarreling with the idea of people gaining success merely by being born into privilege (financial, intellectual, pure unadulterated luck). This speaks volumes to the heiress shopping with daddy's credit card that has no limit or expiration date (Paris Hilton), as well as, to the struggling college student, attending classes full time and working a 40+ hour week (Me). It changes the viewpoint of working hard and fighting to survive, beating yourself to death with extra shifts and a never ending supply of Ramen Noodles, all while chasing a dream promised but never delivered. As pessimistic as this may seem, Gladwell delivers a claim sure to wake up the rich and encourage the poor. There is a fortitude instilled into our minds after Gladwell shares his personal story, a tragic account of poverty and degradation. And through all of his pessimism and depressing findings of success being predetermined, he challenges the unpriviledged to not be the statistic, but instead, to fight to be the exception.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|I've never been a fan of Portman, but in this movie she was fantastic because she actually dared to do some acting.  Maybe the storyline itself was the influence, as Portman's character had to do some real internal dancing as well to fill both aspects of the role she'd been cautiously chosen for--that of both the White and Black Swans.<br /><br />Gripping from the beginning without a breather, this movie makes the most of all its cast, but I'd expect nothing less from an Aronofsky production.  Thankfully this wasn't the usual ballet-snoozefest; I never dreamed a dancing film could be so dark.

B003L77GG0|4.0|Yes, this was choppy at times, but haven't most of the SV seasons for the past 4 been choppy? Here in ten, Clark sort of gets back in the groove and begins to take on the seriousness that is needed as he transitions to Supe. The special FX are getting better every season and this looks especially good on a High Def TV. Enjoyable, still not tops like the first few seasons were. We have high hopes for this final season though showing right now and the last few episodes should be the best ever.

B002JM1VJG|1.0|I would not recommend purchasing this DVD. The picture quality is terrible. I have the 93-99 collection on DVD, which shares some of the same videos. The difference in quality is pronounced. This DVD has a grainy picture quality that would be surpassed by VHS. What a disappointment. These are some of the most notable videos in the history of music videos. They deserve a much better treatment. Hopefully a remastered video collection will be released at some point in the future.
0307593495|5.0|Kurt Wallander is getting old and being honest about it. His own mortality is reflected in the death around him, and in the birth of his granddaughter.  Politics is more foregrounded in this novel than the others; people who have lived through the wars of the 1960s up through the collapse of the Soviet Union will appreciate the inferences of just how nasty international espionage was, how over-the-top, how stacked with illusions.  The unlayering of a political murder in this novel is also an unlayering of the melancholy Wallander.  It's a moving book, and one more example of how the borders of crime fiction and \\"mainstream\\" fiction have become blurred in a world that is increasingly criminal.    According to the author this is the last Wallander book.  I hope that Wallander's daughter, Linda, will take the baton; and I hope the aging retired Wallander will be kept as a character and fatherly adviser.     A great read.I think it's his best.
B0029LHWFO|4.0|It took me a while to read this book, despite the good reviews. In fact, I just finished it (2011). Jack Cashill's accusations of plagiarism prompted me to look at it for myself. Apparently, it's not enough for Obama to advocate fascism/socialism and kicking bunnies in the stomach. He's also got to be a terrible person. How effin' juvenile. Cashill charges that Bill Ayers actually wrote the book. I've got Ayers's Fugitive Days waiting at the library and I hope the Cashill comes in by the time I finish it so that I can go over the specific argument.    Reading over the comments, it strikes me that people's political views, left and right, affect their perception of the book. Those who get \\"Obama hates white people\\" differ from my own reading. I admit I'm on the left. However, I have never thought the President walks on water. Nevertheless, I want to say something about the book as a book, rather than as a political litmus test.    First of all, it's a rather curious memoir, in that you don't find out a lot about Barack Obama's inner life. One senses a characteristic reserve, displayed also in his interviews, an unwillingness to give away too much. Indeed, he seems far more interested in other people than in himself. Indeed, he's much more penetrating of others. He tends to see things through a sociological, rather than a personal lens, despite the recounting of personal experience. The personal gets filtered through the sociological. People are often seen as instances of general problems.    The prose is better than usual from a politician, and thoroughly consistent with the language of Obama's early speeches. In fact, more than a few passages in the book sound like parts of speeches. However, this is a politician/lawyer's default genre. My favorite section was his account of his trip to Kenya to see his father's extended family. There's no romanticizing of the place. Indeed, Obama recognizes the dangers of such an attitude. But he doesn't swing to the other extreme,either. He tries to take a realistic look at his family and at Kenya.    Most important, however, is the narrative's overall movement. Obama begins as a stranger to himself, which is probably another reason why he doesn't reveal a lot. At the time, he probably didn't know a lot. The book is a search and negotiation for identity. To Obama's credit, he has plenty of opportunity to settle into some preset world-view. In fact, the temptations are pretty great. But he's honest enough with himself to realize that they ultimately won't satisfy him. He has to work out his own salvation. By the end of the book, he may not have arrived at a final triumph, but he definitely has turned a corner.

0385533829|5.0|I have some friends who bought the normal book and it didn't have any pictures or illustrations, well it does have some illustrations but they're just like pencil lines and simple drawings which discouraged me about getting the book. So, I then decided to buy this one and it's just great. Totally what I was expecting. It's very heavy first of all, the pages are glossy or poster like material which really boosts the picture quality and the text is of course wider and eye friendly, easy to read.<br /><br />I've heard and seen online that the book is pure BS because it deviates too much from reality because Masons do this or that differently or some other stuff is pure fantasy. Well, I, as a Mason can say that \\"For your eyes only\\" kind of situation, some things have to be either omitted or D. Brown did not include bc he does not know/cannot say everything about Masons. The rituals as written on the book are something like that but it is just a preview for so to say.<br /><br />Finally, and this is the most important thing. Remember that this is of course a fictional story based on true places, events and all that sort of stuff.<br /><br />The story is awesome (although haven't finished reading it) and the illustrations really drag you deeper into your imagination.

1555175163|4.0|A readable, concise bio of Ip Man: reverential, descriptive, with anecdotes that reveal his personality, approach, and philosophy. Ip Man is a unique individual but also a full-blown archetype of the old-school Chinese martial arts grandmaster: proudly Chinese, rather traditional, a lettered renaissance man (equally skilled in Chinese calligraphy), well-mannered, genuinely kind, charming, and extraordinarily skilled and effective despite a small physique (which strengthens wing chun's message about its effectiveness against larger opponents). As a morality tale, I especially enjoyed the late anecdote about how Ip Man strove, in his later years, to impart his full skills to selected students and how one student showed his care for his Sifu who was under considerable strain.    Authored by son Ip Ching, there is much personal credibility, though more critical readers may notice (and, I suggest, forgive) the usual hagiographical biases. On the latter, hagiographical inclinations are a common feature of the martial arts biography genre, and Ip Man's historical stature in the wing chun world means that in the vast majority of bios out there, he can do no wrong. That said, to my knowledge and research, Ip Man is the real deal, much loved by students for his class and kindness as much as he was admired for his skill.    [Disclosure: I am a dedicated Jeet Kune Do martial artist, not wing chun trained, but I have a deep respect for wing chun and consider it the mother art and the original soul of Jeet Kune Do. I approach the Ip Man literature with much respect and also objectivity.]
B004PEJ1H0|2.0|Not sure exactly what I was expecting, but as a fan of both New Order and George Michael, I jumped at this before ever hearing it or anything about it. Best described as a loungy/breathy version of True Faith, a la \\"Songs From the Last Century\\" style.  Remember his version of Roxanne? About the same here. Not my cup o'tea, but all things considered (GM's personal history, the lyrical content and the Comic Relief angle), I'm assuming tongue was planted firmly in cheek as he warbled through this one. If you're inclined to buy it for any reason other than simply contributing to a good cause, I'd recommend sampling it first.

It has everything you need in a book and it is one of those page-twisters that you will find very hard to put down. I recommend this very very very highly!
B003X73QA8|5.0|I really like Arcade Fire in general, being a fan since Funeral.  But this collection has really turned me on.  I love concept albums and this is the best in years with coherent conceptual and musical themes throughout the album. There are ponderous melodies and foot stomping tunes that tell the story of growing up in the suburbs.  While the album is not without a few flaws (some unnecessary repitition) anyone who likes good alt rock in general, and who likes Arcade Fire in particular, will find this album to be a real gem.
0316017922|4.0|Read _Outliers_ and become the next Bill Gates! (maybe)     This book is a much longer version of the old adage: \\"Luck (or success) is where preparation meets opportunity.\\"     Yes, but how much preparation? And how do you find the right opportunity? Gladwell's answer: about 10,000 hours of practice should prepare you for that moment when opportunity comes-a-knocking (i.e. Bill Gates put in 10,000 hours of computer programming, the Beatles put in 10,000 hours of stage time before getting a record deal).     This opportunity arises from a hodgepodge of culture, birth date, time period, and where someone is \\"from.\\" For example, of the one hundred richest men on the planet (ever), many like Rockefeller and Carnegie, were born in mid-19th Century America (1830-ish). Random? Gladwell thinks not.    These men may seem like \\"outliers\\" (freaks of nature who just got lucky), but really they were both in the right place at the right time AND they also put in a heck of a lot of hard work. When the industrial revolution began, they were primed and ready to become millionaires. Similarly, if you happened to be born around 1955 and you had a family who encouraged you to study (a lot), and you had unlimited access to computers (as a teenager) and you enjoyed computer programming (a relatively new phenomenon), you could also be like Bill Gates.     The only downside is that if you want to jump on the \\"outlier\\" train, it seems you must have some sense of clairvoyance to know when (as Tasler said in his review) the next industrial revolution or silicon age might arise, otherwise you might waste 10,000 hours on the wrong bright idea (8 Tracks anyone?).    The best part about this book is not even the seemingly researched, poignantly delivered anecdotal stories, but the fact that Gladwell makes it feel like he's writing just to you. Hockey fan? He's got a story for ya. Aviation junkie? Rock and roll aficionado? He's got you covered too.     Essentially, Gladwell wants to make you re-think the definition of success. Some questions came to mind:         -What if we acknowledged each other's cultural differences rather than shove them under politically correct rugs?       -What if we built relationships and encouraged each other to put in 10,000 hours of work towards our passions?        - What people had equal access to preparation and opportunity?     Read the book, join this discussion, and let's never stop asking the hard questions...

B001FB5634|2.0|&lt;Spoilers below><br /><br />This was a very different movie, with the father in the movie quietly narrating the tale. It had the unusual atmosphere, and the music, and you'll definitely be entertained watching the movie wondering what's going to happen. It had the gritty realistic nature viewers claim they are hungry for, and the film certainly makes one appreciate what we have, and despite all the terror it has a positive ending. . . but I have to give the film a negative review. Perhaps I felt it was contrived (which it certainly was - watching it again and looking back on it), but the main problem I had was probably the son and how whiny and helpless he is.<br /><br />Another reviewer on my friends list, a radical of sorts, claims the main problem in society today is this darn (unconscious) white male hero myth. I suspect he's being facetious, or pretending to be jealous (cause I suspect we're taught you become a hero by defending women and people of color). At least white men get to be the hero. This movie had the hero watching out for his son. Not sure he's really even a hero. At one point in the movie his son asks him, \\"will we always be the good guys\\"? The father tells him something like, \\"We'll always be the good guys no matter what\\".<br /><br />When the dad is holding a man he's surprised, at gunpoint in the woods, the guy tells him, \\"I bet you only have one or two bullets left\\", \\"I don't think you'll shoot me\\" \\"You've never killed anyone before\\". Then he makes his move on the dad and dad shoots him. I think this was a matter of getting from point A to B. To where his dad shoots the guy. If he made a quiet, Clint Eastwood move on his Dad, we might identify or feel empathy for him. But it was really stupid, when you think about it. Twelve years after nuclear war, almost everyone and everything is dead, cannibalism is rampant, and the guy tells him 'I don't think you'll shoot, I don't think you've killed anyone before'? How is it he thinks the dad only has two bullets left?<br /><br />There's a line we do take seriously, I suspect. When they're running away, from the household of cannibals, while one of their victims is banging on the roof of the basement, trying to get out, I think you can barely hear them angrily yell, \\"Get back down there\\", \\"Where do you think you're going\\".<br /><br />Later the pair stop in the woods, with his father saying, \\"I just don't like this\\". The camera looks around and we can't see anything, but they're going to travel back anyway. Fair enough. But then a hoard of cannibals noisily attacks two screaming young girls, just where we were looking. Fortunately (in the feeding frenzy they are in) none of them notice the boy and his son. It's not as if the 'zombies' jump out after the girls (and the girls aren't hidden, either), it's as if the camera jumps, like in a 'vogue' new age zombie-slasher movie.<br /><br />When they run away, the dad has to carry the kid everywhere. Can't twelve year old kids run? You'd have to be Hulk Hogan or someone, in tip top shape, to be able to travel faster carrying a child like that. Don't children even in first grade have gym class and foot races?<br /><br />It makes sense in the movie that the boy has grown up, after this apocalypse, because no 12 year old nowadays would be as meek and clueless as this boy. The boys purity or whatever might have been interesting, making a point of comparing him to kids nowadays, but I don't think the film took that angle. Maybe it was trying to turn us into kids that are more innocent, but I doubt it. It would have been interesting, too, if a brash 12 year old of today would have been exposed to a desperate world like this on camera. Most 12 year old kids would adapt to a world like this pretty quickly, I think. The average kid seems to almost want to be living in such a free-for all post-apocalyptic world like this.

B004L3AR0K|5.0|When i went to see the green hornet i saw this movie on the list. I had no idea of what it was about. When it came to dvd i saw it at the libary and picked it up(Just Outta Curiosity). I Watched it last night and was blown away on how good the movie was. I thought it was going to be one of those just sex all the time movies but i was wrong. It has an intense story about to people who are trying not to fall in love and do. Great movie, great story great actors. If you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B00004RE7D|5.0|The Search For Spock takes up where The Wrath of Khan ends with the photon tube used for Spock's disinternment sitting on the Genesis planet, thanks, in part to Khan. After getting back to the Genesis planet, a battle with the Klingons, and blowing up the Enterprise. Spock's body is taken to Mt. Sileya on Vulcan and is reunited with his Katra, which was placed in the good Dr. McCoy. This is an xtremely well acted and directed movie, I believe directed by Leonard Nimoy himself.I originally saw this movie when it came out at the Panama City, FL mall theater.[[ASIN:B000I3W1XS Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]
0316056863|5.0|The book was very funny, insightful and interesting. My brother looked concerned as I burst out into laughter for the 37th time. But what I found most surprising was that it was really kind, particularly towards the end. The only problem I had with Bossypants, was that I felt like there was more to tell. I hope Tina writes another book.

B002ZG99QS|4.0|I tend to make my reviews of products with hundreds of reviews brief since there is little to add to the existing ones.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this film has fabulous production values, great acting, wonderful action sequences, but a plot that is so thin as to be nonexistent. This movie almost fell in the same category as the wretched \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\". What redeemed it in my eyes was the way the actors made the most out of the material they were given to work with. Jeff Bridges is particularly impressive in a dual role. The plot is nothing more than a few cliches strung together - growth of a rebellious son of a famous father under pressure, a monster created by a modern Frankenstein, fallen hero redeems himself at the final moment, etc. Surely the screenwriters can do better?<br /><br />But ultimately the acting and action kept me involved. Recommended, but Shakespeare this isn't.
0316056863|5.0|I read this book in 4 days.  It's hilarious and flows really well.  If you are looking for the typical memoir book, this one is not for you!  Her stories are a little all over the place but her storytelling is hilarious and if you are a Tina Fey fan then this book will make you love her even more.  I laughed out loud throughout this entire book.  This is  great book and would be a great gift also!  BUY IT!
B003XKPPOU|5.0|I just purchased The toy story 3 (Four disc bluray and DVD combo + digital copy), my bluray player can play the Bluray movie nicely, but when I insert the DVD version to my bluray player, it say the region was wrong, so I have a  question,  does the region code for bluray and DVD not the same ?  If not Why it is in the same package ?
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am on day 22 of level 1 and I couldnt be happier with the results!  After day 3 I could start seeing changes in the mirror... day three!!!   The workout is quick, but it is balls to the wall.  Its hard on the joints, but work through it you will be happy you did.  I hated Jillian in the beginning and swore she was not human.  But now Im totally used to her quirky little sayings and I feel motivated by her not annoyed.  My plan is 30 days on level 1, 30 days on level 2 and 30 days on level 3.  I have a long way to go, but Im excited about it.    Day 22 results:  I have lost 8 pounds and 11 inches!! 5 inches in my chest, 4 inches in my waist and 3 inches in my hips!!    I did not buy the DVD, I am viewing it for FREE on my OnDemand channel with my local cable company thru the FREEZONE.  If you have an OnDemand channel, go check and see if you have Exercise TV on it and then there will be a Jillian Michaels tab with several of her workouts.. for FREE!!!   I read in many other reviews about how you have to watch 10 mins of infomercial crap first before you can workout and I think that is super crappy!  Major flaw on behalf of Jillians company.    I would and have been recommending the 30 Day shred video to my friends.  If your like me and need instant results to stay motivated- this is the workout for you!
0385338724|3.0|Sophie Kinsella is not my most fav romance writer. I ve read \\"undomestic goddess\\" and \\"Can u keep a secrect (translated version)\\". The general impression is, not much sex, the hero's character usually underdeveloped. And the writer has such a thing against ambition, business, success...etc. She has a point there. But I feel that the view is somehow lopsided.    Nonetheless, I enjoyed reading her books, with laughs. This one is not one of the best though, mainly becoz it started too slowly. In the first five or ten chapters or so, I felt a strong impulse to drop it, to forget abt it, becoz it looked just like some silly gal's nonsense day dream. It also developed quite slowly. Of coz I wanted to know how it happened, but I din think I have the patience to go through another twenty chapters to find out!    However, it turns out a lot more gripping as one important character (J) came out. I finished it a lot faster than I had expected. Despite of many comments that the dramatic changes in Lexi was unbelievable, I found the story quite convincing. It felt good when towards the end, everything had an explanation.     And I have to support the many roles, whom have been called \\"annoying\\" in another review. I found each of them lovely in a certain sense. Even Amy, who was annoying indeed, was a funny character at the same time.    I d recommend this book if u have plenty of time. I think it s a great idea and plot. But I feel it cld be much better done in a more compact way, that s to say, the story cld be told in fewer words......
B0001I561E|1.0|PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!

0156030306|4.0|Although there is no getting around the fact that the short story upon which this novel is based is much better, this is still a fabulous tale about the mind, fabulously told.  Latter-day readers will draw parallels with Forest Gump, but of course this tale came first.  The story is told from the point of view of an adult with the IQ of an eight- or nine-year-old boy. Selected for an experiment that *may* increase his intelligence,  the boy begins journalling his thoughts.  The reader experiences his meteoric rise to genius status as told in his own words, which become increasingly erudite with each passing week.  The question of whether emotional maturity and intellectual maturity are at all correlated may seem a bit of a foregone conclusion, but the reactions of those involved in the experiment to their new creation are nuanced, as are those of the experimentee.  Any science fiction fan should have this on his/her bookshelf, but it is an  important enough work that others who like to think outside the box of everyday human existence should pick it up, too.

This dvd will provide you with a front row seat for an amazing Styx experience! Don't miss out!
B002RVZV9K|5.0|An interesting and insightful look at three very individual guitar stylists. If you have any interests in how things are done behind the scences or the thought processes put forth by musicians, I highly recommend this DVD. Highlight moment (one mentioned in an earlier review) Jimmy Page playing the chords to a classic Led Zep song and the look on the faces of The Edge and Jack White,is priceless.
B001LF347E|5.0|Channel surfing late one Friday night with only reality shows to watch (ugh), there it was, MERLIN!!!!!! I became totally enchanted. The superb actors bring to each and every scene that special something as they entwine themselves in their relationships.  Its just awesome!!! I have gotton soooo many people hooked on this show.  We NEVER want it to end.  This show NEEDS to be on a main network station...it is just toooo darn good to show up here in the US on the SYFY channel at such a late hour. So if you actors are reading this, thank you so very much for bringing this fine show to this Grandma...I LOVE IT!
B0019X3YXM|1.0|The French director may compose the movie in an unique matter, but felt a bit messy. His transitions were too off, sometimes quick and sometimes slow. The humor was a bit off taste. At times that's what made it feel slow.     And I must mention, good movies should almost never be remade.
B004SBX112|1.0|is it always going to take this long to update? android market got an update already. Amazon offers a lot but if slower updates are a result, I'm not sure if its worth it.
B004LUS390|5.0|Incredible amount of options. Great quality. Low price. I really couldn't ask for more. I love it. The only limitation is what you bring to the table. Having the feature of layers is worth it alone. The most recent update does cause my Evo to force close but I'm not going to count that against them. We'll see if they get it figured out. I don't want to come back and write a nasty review. If you're considering it, don't hesitate. You won't be disappointed.
0670022411|3.0|This is a long, long read. The heroine is conflicted about using her magical abilities. The action begins when a vampire witnesses her using magic to get a book from a shelf, yet later in the book all her attempts at magic are clumsy and inept. Diana's qualities and abilities in the book are so inconsistent that it drove me mad. If you are new to the genre, this may be the book for you. If you've read a lot of vampire fiction, you will note that it is a mis-mash of plots already written by Anne Rice, Katherine Howe and Stephenie Meyer, with a time-traveling twist already explored by Diana Gabaldon in the \\"Outlander\\" series.    By making Diana Bishop's character an expert in medieval alchemy, it's difficult to relate to her at all. The mysterious manuscript she finds is never completely explained, the supporting characters' backstories are only covered as last-minute expediencies, the murder of Diana's parents is explained in a tediously convoluted way and the novel wobbles it way to an unsatisfying ending. As in many romance novels, the \\"she's strong-willed and hard-headed/she's a fainting flower\\" ploy repeats endlessly. While I really wanted to like this new author, finishing the book became an exercise in perseverance. I will most likely read the next installment, but I hope Ms. Harkness is able to focus more clearly. This book had a lot of tantalizing threads that just weren't pulled together. Perhaps the book would have profited from better editorial advice.

0316069353|5.0|I love Michael Connelly's books.  My favorite, of course, is Harry Bosch.  But Haller is a close second.    I have a problem with people who rate the \\"book\\" one star and then complain about the Kindle price.  It makes it look like the book itself is bad.  There should be a different way to deal with this.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|I have been wanting a multi-tool for awhile now. After learning the Bear Grylls was teaming up with Gerber to make one I knew I had to have one. Well I bought 2. One for my wife who is always in need of a good multi-tool at her job in IT and one for myself.  These are very well built and have just the right tools I was looking for. I have used every tool except the Lanyard which is kind of useless at least once. The design is great you can use the tools without having to open it, all the tools lock in place, the spring loaded needle nose are great. I have heard from a few people who thing the price is too high but I think it is just right when you consider how well made and durable the tool is plus it is a Gerber so if the the tool breaks they will fix it for free.

B001UV4XI8|4.0|Most people can read the Amazon write-up or other reviews and already get to know the gist of this movie and what it is about. I will not write a full page review like some reviews so lets get down to it. Things you need to know if you didn't already know these facts.<br />1. Yes, this is a slow paced movie. It is build-up for the final battle. (An entire movie, mostly bent around one task)<br />2. Some character you like/love will die. Nuff said there.<br />3. Some scenes are definately NOT for young children. (Bellatrix scene interrogating Hermione is a good example)<br />4. Ron...What was he thinking? I don't think a friend, especially one who has been through so much, would act this way. But...that is a personal observation. Would have liked to see more bonding. Not in a weird way but in a best friends way.<br />5. Not enough Harry and Ginny. I don't know why but they just seem so right together.<br />6. 146 minutes folks. It is a kind of long movie.<br />There isn't a lot more to say other than I found it fully enjoyable through multiple viewings over the weekend and as long as you know some of the facts, I hope you will enjoy it too. A must buy for the fans. A must rent for anyone else who might just be following the story.
B002ZG976U|5.0|This is one of Cher's best. Excellant movie to watch. It has a real story to it.I would watch it again in a heart beat.
0316069353|5.0|Yay!  Connelly's back.  I was a little disappointed in his last book \\"The Reversal\\" but \\"The Fifth Witness\\" really delivered.  Though I still prefer Harry Bosch over Connelly's Mickey Haller character Haller is growing on me.  I absolutely loved the ending though you pretty much know there's a twist coming Connelly put a great spin on it.  As others have already pointed out there's a lot of legal detail in this book but personally I enjoyed it.  The best part of any Connelly novel is how real he makes the characters especially the main protagonist.<br /><br />4.5/5

B004G600A4|5.0|After several years of ho-hum animated features that took 2nd place to Pixar's annual masterpiece, Disney finally came out with a top-notch animated film in the same mold as Snow White, Aladdin, and the Little Mermaid.  And they based it on Rapunzel, probably the most famous fairy tale that has yet to be adapted to the big screen.  Being part comedy, part suspense, part romance and part musical, this film contains all the keys of a Disney classic.  The music is great, both the soundtrack and the singing.  The animation is great, and looks like a hybrid of Pixar's CGI and Disney's traditional animation.  The film itself is quite long for a Disney cartoon, and is probably too long for younger children.  But for everyone else, it is great.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|I was at MSG for one of the shows and this collection captures the event well. Some have complained about Winwood taking a back seat to Clapton, but in reality his voice was a step above Clapton's and his mastery of the keyboards was synergistic with Clapton's guitar.  The two just kept pushing each other to a higher realm of musicality and the DVD and CD captures that.  I think they played 3 shows at MSG and the one we went to was just a wonderful experience.  Now, others can share in that wonderment.
B003H9MSPG|4.0|This gun is a great choice for modders in my opinion not for those who want range right out of the box. The reason for this is that it has the same internal design as the nerf raider and recon so uses a smaller tube design than the longshot. If you want to have a gun that shoots great for you right out of the box this isn't the one but i think that once a person is willing to put a little time and about a dollar into it it can be a really good gun. This is because the longstrike is one of the easiest guns to get into and to mod where the longshot is much harder to work with and find the material to use.  Once modded (all I did was take out the air restrictor and add a peice of velvet padding), it shot a measured 80ft. This is all that is really needed in an indoor arena battle anyway so I think that the benifits of a good gun that not only looks good but shoots 80ft. out weigh having to put a little time and effort into it.

044656740X|4.0|In my view, this book wasn't an attempt to be a blueprint on how you get rich.<br /><br />I believe that one of the best things that this book has to offer is that it challenges you to think differently than you likely do now.  It gives some decent examples in the common thinking patterns of a rich person and a poor person. When you think about it after the book points it out, you discover that there are indeed stark differences in how money is handled and their general attitudes.<br /><br />I personally didn't care for the diagrams in the book, they didn't really help me out all that much.  But what I took away from it is a new outlook on what constitutes an asset and a liability, meaning if it doesn't make you money then it's a liability (this includes your home and your car even though they are considered assets on a spread sheet).<br /><br />I'd honestly say if you pick this then use it as a springboard to reading something that you're intersted in for making some money (stock market, real estate, etc.) and don't expect it to be something that's going to teach you how to make money in any given field.
0896898288|5.0|I do not understand the statement that this book isn't diagrammed.  It couldn't BE more fully diagrammed for each block - with fabric images too.  All one needs to do is enlarge the block to the size you want.  Should the author agree to come do that for the Buyer too?    On the content, it is wonderful.  It made my heart ache for the earlier days in our Nation, when'Farm' women knew how to do all of the home arts, and when mothering was an esteemed and precious way of life for children and families.  Every effort was being made at that time to promote the 'City' woman and to get people off the farm, no doubt so gov't and big business could take over the land AND the lives of it's citizens.   This book is about a Contest that asked Farm women to write essays on whether they would have their own daughters marry Farmers, based on their experience.    As you read it you will find a common thread... true and devoted married love, diligent hard work for their family, reverence for God and a contentment and joy in life and being self-sustaining and well educated writers who did not come out of the Public School System.  I can't tell you how many pangs I suffered as I read the essays and realized how far our Nation has fallen... abortion, Day Care, cancer from microwaved plastic encased meals because Mom can't cook from scratch any more, children who spend their lives on concrete and learning to not talk to strangers or fearing molestation, illiteracy and crime... I could go on but I won't.    It hurts my heart to see the loss we have suffered as a people in our nation... loss of skills, but more of true love and family devotion as a way of life.  I count this book a treasure, and because I sew all of the patterns are easily made up using the precise and full color diagrams that the author provides in the book, let alone the CD.  I would highly encourage anyone to get this book simply to read about our Nation's life in a sweeter day and time.

0316017922|4.0|Gladwell creates a story-telling conversation with the reader as he integrates various pop-culture references.  Whether his depiction of Bill Gates, The Beatles, or even hockey players is relevant to you or not, he connects with his audience.  This connection is so eloquent that he makes you feel as if the both of you are old friends swapping stories of what you know.  While he is sharing many historical life-success stories, he inadvertently challenges his readers to think about their own success.  How many hours have I accumulated toward my dream?  Am I an undiscovered outlier that has beaten many odds?  This self-evaluation came as a great surprise because when I started this book, I thought he would be preachy or tell me things I already knew.  Actually, Gladwell recognizes the many challenges or advantages we are all offered while struggling to realize the dreams we work so hard for.  Even if the stories of hockey, IQ's or The Beatles' do not reach you, when you set the book down, you will have a realization of your own and recognize the many effort in your own life. You might even calculate the hours you have put into your own dream like I did.  Outliers greatly surprised me with its message and I encourage you to read it and recognize your own success story!

B004IFYN2Y|4.0|An excellent combination of true life thriller and drama \\"Fair Game\\" portrays what happened when CIA Agent Valerie Plame Wilson was \\"outed\\" after her husband Ambassador Joe Wilson wrote the New York Times editorial entitled \\"What I Didn't Find In Africa\\" questioning the discovery of material to make nuclear devices which provided part of the rational for President George W. Bush going to war in Iraq. What's fascinating about this dramatic thriller is that it recalls films like \\"All the President's Men\\" in terms of its matter-of-fact presentation and the reaction of our government to try and minimize or discredit people doing what they felt was right.<br /><br />The resulting fall out (pun intended) resulted in his wife being exposed as an agent, putting those under her supervision and those she was trying to help as part of her ops at risk all for political gain. The result was that even Wilson himself faced accusations that he was lying for financial gain in the process. The resulting pressures nearly drove them apart destroying their lives all for the sake of saving face.<br /><br />The film directed by Doug Liman (\\"The Bourne Identity\\") and written by Jez and John Henry-Butterworth but based on the book by Plame benefits from strong and authentic feeling performances by Naomi Watts as Plame and Sean Penn as Wilson.<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition of the film features a strong looking, sharp transfer. Colors don't exactly pop but they aren't meant to here--the film is true to the original theatrical presentation in that regard but detail remains razor sharp throughout the presentation of the film. Audio is quite strong although keep in mind this is primarily a dialogue driven drama.<br /><br />Unfortunately the only special feature included on the Blu-ray is a commentary track by Plame and Wilson and while it is a welcome addition, it would have been interesting to have licensed some of the news footage of Plame's actual testimony about the events that transpired. The duo admit that it's a bit weird commenting on a drama based on real life that they lived through (since there will be a certain amount of fictionalized elements to make it work as a film). It might have been better to have both of them discuss the making of the film with director Liman and comment on the process of life vs. film.<br /><br />An engrossing drama, \\"Fair Game\\" reminds us all that there are real casualities when personal reputations are attacked as part of a political cover up. I imagine that your reaction to the film may be influenced also by your politics as well although given what occurred it shouldn't. What was done to Plame, Wilson and those that depended on them was wrong.<br /><br />Recommended.weird commenting on a drama based on real life that they lived through (since there will be a certain amount of fictionalized elements to make it work as a film).

1439177783|4.0|This journey is an intimate and raw one. It's not a literary work, and is a story you will have heard many times before, the healthy diet that transmogrified into anorexia and bulimia. I read it because I was curious about Portia's life, which to me seemed perfect especially her time acting on \\"Ally McBeal\\". I enjoyed and would recommend this book, even if you have little interest in disordered eating as it's more a tale of discovering and accepting who you are, and for Portia this was coming to terms with her sexuality and how her family in particular reacted to this news. A great read, go on and grab a copy!

B000000OF6|5.0|I knew exactly what I wanted and Amazon provided it for me.  The price was unexpectly low for what I was getting and I was thrilled about that.  I love Queen and play this cd in my car every day.  Great job, Amazon and I will continue to buy from your site.

B002ZG4Q5W|4.0|The StudioCanal version of Kurosawa's \\"Ran\\" looks for all the world like a DVD, a slightly fuzzy one.  I don't recall how the original film looked (I did see it in a theater back when it was released).  Possibly the film was deliberately not intended to look like finely photographed Hollywood products (I'm thinking of Peckinpah's \\"The Wild Bunch\\" on Blu-Ray as a recent example).  Anyway, there are video enthusiasts who can better judge the picture quality than I can.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray is an enormous improvement over the original DVD version (which was horrible).  I haven't seen the Criterion Collection DVD version.<br /><br />Kurosawa's film itself is spectacular, a meticulously plotted catalog of brutality, betrayal, revenge, and loyalty, some of it misplaced. Almost everything that's in \\"King Lear\\" and more, especially a lady who is a better schemer than any of the men.  The film's open, unpopulated landscape with isolated castles looks real enough, but is very much Kurosawa's own construction, as is the crucial final battlefield.  Kurosawa's ability, even with a generous budget, to create castles and burn them down, and to deploy brightly color-coded armies (yellow, red, blue) is astonishing. Fire arrows, massed musket fire, an abundance of horses.<br /><br />The film is justifiably considered a classic.  Despite its stunning visuals, it is not an action film in the sense that \\"Seven Samurai\\" or \\"Yojimbo\\" are.  The fighting is not entertaining and you don't see warriors' skills; mostly, you see slaughter, good mens'lives wasted.  A particularly violent slaughter is set to low-key music by Takemitsu.
0399250573|5.0|This is by far the best book of the series and one of the best books I have ever read. I would recommend this for anyone who loves reading spy novels.
0812550757|2.0|This item was advertised \\"like new condition\\", the book had a corner cut off and the pages looked weathered and aged (they were discolored). I would not buy a used book from this supplier again
