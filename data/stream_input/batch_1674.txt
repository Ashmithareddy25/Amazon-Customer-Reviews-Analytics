0380730405|3.0|This book is in a class by itself.  A classic romantic suspense??...possibly I guess.<br />I found myself not becoming fully interested until about Chapter 16.  From there out, the book relived a vivid nightmare for some characters.  Surpise after surpise, which kept my attention.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|its pretty good. downloaded it to my kindle fire to kill time before class and its great for that.  easy to lose track of time though
B002MGIIZE|5.0|They did a good jog on this one. Much more information about the story line.I iwsh had this information when i first saw this movie. I love this movie and have several copies of it. This makes a nice addition to my set.Thanks Amazon for haveing it in stock.....
B008XG1X18|4.0|love pinterest. The app force closes on both my kindle and my droidx2. if the developers could fix that problem I'd definitely give this 5 stars. Even with the force close problem I am so addicted to the craft ideas that it really doesn't bother me.
B009FZZK8I|5.0|We LOVE The Walking Dead series!  It's one of the best shows on tv (and I don't even like zombies!).  Great storyline, characters are well-developed.  We look forward to every episode.  I'm not a horror fan AT ALL, but this series is different.  You can get so engrossed in the story that you forget there even are zombies at times.  My teenager was watching a marathon (before AMC was pulled on Dish) several months ago, and I happened to walk past the tv, got interested in the dialogue, and wound up watching the entire series up to that point.  Been hooked ever since.  It's that good.<br /><br />To my fellow Dish grumblers ... I can sympathize with you.  We had a massive revolt and a threatened mutiny at our house when Dish dropped the AMC channel over the summer.  Honestly, TWD is the ONLY show we watch on AMC, and since we are still under contract with Dish, it makes no sense for us to switch providers right now.  I have called Dish numerous times over the past few months and complained.  I've also written AMC and complained.  Dish finally offered us a free Roku and $35 credit on our bill so we can watch the entire season of TWD via streaming.  If you're a Dish customer, this is certainly worth looking into.  You do have to wait until the next day to watch the latest episode (which is a minor inconvenience), but we were able to do so with no problem.<br /><br />*For those having trouble finding the episodes* - scroll down to where it says, \\"Watch other episodes from Season 3\\".  I do think the way Amazon has Season 3 listed under the \\"Inside the Walking Dead\\" preview is very confusing for folks who aren't familiar with how this works.<br /><br />Whether Dish and AMC ever come to an agreement is anybody's guess, but if you're a Walking Dead fan and a Dish subscriber, I would highly recommend you complain loudly (to both AMC and Dish) about this being settled.  You have a voice and it does matter since you're paying for their services.  I'm aggravated with both parties, so please don't think I'm taking either side.<br /><br />Regardless, we are able to watch the newest Walking Dead episodes as they come out.  Amazon's Instant Video service worked great for us.

B00846REIS|4.0|It's keeping me entertained!  There are several ladies at my office that have an \\"unofficial\\" book club and we started with the \\"50 Shades\\" series.  This book is right along the same story line.  Can't wait to get to the rest in the series.
B000FC1MM8|3.0|Was slightly disappointed but read it through.  Will also read another in the futrue and judge whether to buy the next book
0920668364|5.0|Now I am sending this book to my grandchildren (really, though, to their parents).  I had read this book to my children.  I still cry when I read it.  This is a beautiful book.
B007ROGI5S|3.0|This is the first book of the author's that I have read and frankly I was expecting more. To say the book is not good is unfair; but it is yet another predictable tale about Black female force in a hostile white dominated culture. Morrison's writing is powerful, but not exhilarating or thought provoking. It is almost like a sermon about what we already know. I discovered nothing that I have not seen in the many television adaptations of her work, and easily guessed the outcome based on these. Once I finished the book,I more or less forgot about it in a day or two.
0060775858|5.0|The words in this book create a beautiful soothing bedtime reading routine for young children.  I enjoyed the many, many, MANY times I read this to my kids.  The artwork is as lovely as the text.
1569242739|5.0|My husband and I are vegan and for his birthday party this year, instead of making a vegan cake for him and getting everyone else a store-bought special, I made a vegan cupcake buffet and used three different recipes from this book. I made the Green Tea cupcakes, the Banana Split cupcakes and the Toasted Coconut cupcakes with the coffee/coconut frosting.  Not only were they all super-cute and fun to look at all lined-up buffet-style, but the taste was phenomenal!  I had three different people come up to me and tell me that these were, hands down, the best cupcakes they've ever tasted.  What I love most about that statement is that the guests didn't even qualify it with \\"best vegan cupcake\\" but simply BEST.CUPCAKE.EVER!  The Green tea came out exactly as the picture shows it.... so pretty!  The coffee coconut was a hit with the adults and the banana split was the all around favorite.  I am so glad I bought this book!  I can't wait to try them all!
1594744475|4.0|Cute, adorable lunches that will make your child smile? Sounds like a good idea, but may be more difficult in practice. I picked up this book from the library on a whim. My teenage son has lunch at school and would probably die of embarrassment on the spot if he opened up a lunch box to saw a bunch of little rice ball chick staring lovingly up at him. My (now married) college daughter would probably name the chicks and refuse to eat her new friends. If you have the time and energy - and if your child would appreciate your efforts - then this book is a great place to start. Obviously, you can substitute items to meet your dietary preferences and, with experience, you can develop your own friendly food critters. If you, like myself, are just intrigued by the concept and will not be actively bento-ing, then this book is worth getting out the library.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I found this to be the ultimate love story. The explicit sexual content is what a woman in love does to keep the love of her life happy and fulfilled.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|When I read the first book, \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\", I could not put it down and was so pleased that there was a sequel to it! Almost finished with the 2nd of the set of 3 and will be moving on to the final book in the trilogy.  I really think that there should be a movie made on this awsome story!<br />Tawas
B001CDLATE|5.0|First of all, if you have not seen the movie, do so. This was shot I believe in 70mm film and has some stunning imagery. The blu-ray serves it justice. This is one you'll want to have in your collection.<br /><br />I looked for this DVD for a few years before it came out on blu-ray previously having owned it on VHS. One of my top five in my collection.<br /><br />Recently I have noticed that there are cheap blu-rays being sold in minimal casing and all that. This is a quality product of a great film.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|We waited through the summer madness over The Avengers, had heard the hype, some friends saw it and liked it so we were excited to watch it on our new HDTV.<br />We had seen all the previous super hero movies that were building up to this one. A lot of action without enough story. Each hero fights each other then they come together to fight a super, arch-villan.....like I said...lots of fighting not so much story.
B004GBIE3Y|3.0|Better than I expected, but certainly no surprises. Good for a Sunday afternoon rental. Also: People in the nuthouse are never this beautiful, sexy, alluring, or fascinating. Ever.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Shwew that was a good series. all three were impossible to put down. I read all three in three days!
B00992CF6W|3.0|crafting tables and chests don't work, and when peaceful is off, nothing happens, I DIDNT EVEN SEE THE CLASSIC CREEPER waste of seven bucks
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie looks great in 3D. This is one of the best comic book movies made. When I pre-ordered this movie it was $25 but went down to $20 on the day of release, Amazon refunded me the difference. I will be pre-ordering all my movies on Amazon from now on.
B009OA57MI|1.0|you should not get this game it sucked .do not get this app it will start to cloth up it sucks
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I could not stop reading! book one was great but book two was even better. sexy love scenes and lots of suspense! Eva is a spitfire in this book!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Excellent movie, there are to many idiots putting it down with bad reviews just because they don't understand it.
0671027344|5.0|I read this book 8 years ago for the first time.  It was touching, emotional, and real for me.  I cried the first time I read it, and cried the second, third, fourth- and even the fifth time.  There's no way to describe how it can make a person feel, but this is an amazing book that should be read by anyone and everyone, of any age- because we have all felt like Charlie at times.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This is an excellent book from JK Rowling as a first novel for adults. As a huge adult fan of the Harry Potter series, this lives up to every one of my expectations! Worth every penny!

B00026WU7I|5.0|This is Dylan's best and smartest album he ever did. the lyrics drip with rich poetry, and his singing is at it's peak.<br /><br />Tangled Up in Blue tells the story of a guy and his troubles through a certain period of time concerning a woman he loved.<br /><br />Simple Twist of Fate is the sad story of a man who was picked up and dropped by the best woman he ever met.<br /><br />I'm not gonna go through the whole tracklist, but this album is very musical, poetical, and all around a good listen.<br /><br />One more worth mention is Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts. it is the best story ever written. poetical or not. the Jack of Hearts is the best character ever. I hope this review was helpful.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was an enjoyable read about some of our very best doing a great job! Thanks for writing about it!
0525953728|5.0|I really enjoyed how the author talked to you in the writing. My brother is in the military and it is facinating to learn new things about all the things they really have to do to fight for our freedom. Loved the book :)
B000R7GKQE|5.0|The season got here swiftly and was exactly what I was promised. It works wonderfully and was in great condition.<br />Plus the show is amazing, but that's beside the point.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|An extremely engrossing and fun read...been a while since I was caught up so wholly in a good story. Sexy, fantasy, and a bit dark. Bought the 2nd and 3rd book right away and was disappointed when I finished them.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Basically what the title says. Got here quickly and everything works great and all the parts are there and barely scratched. In good condition for being used and for a great price.
1423140605|5.0|My kids are in constant demand of Rick Riordan's book. I love his style also! This Mark of Athena has everything in a book you could want. I love all the action. It's really hard to put down... that's the only draw back!
B006RUJST6|4.0|I thought this was a well written book that kept me hooked right from the beginning. I didnt know what a \\"slam\\" was before reading this book. It makes you laugh and cry. I have recomended it to several people already.
B005DC68NI|4.0|This book is an easy read with tons of helpful advice for a notice self-publisher. I've read a couple of these and this one has quite a bit of info I haven't seen elsewhere. Well worth the purchase!
B0063B2C5G|5.0|Bones has a very dynamic cast with a great plot in each of the shows. I only wish that season 7 was available for free- we have been paying to watch every episode out of our intoxicating obsession with it. There are always new serial killers to follow and of course, the love story between Bones & Booth and Angela & Hodgins and make it more exciting and romantic for me. You don't just enjoy watching these seasons, you actually learn a lot about psychology and anthropology, \\"anthropologically speaking.\\"

0743297334|3.0|\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is Hemingway's first novel.  It has some first novel problems, namely issues with structure in certain places.  There are digressions that really aren't that important, and as hard as the author tries to understate matters, some things are beaten into your head and other details, important details, are surprisingly easy to miss.<br /><br />But the thing that makes this so complicated to review is the characters' overt anti-Semitism and utter unlikeability.  One wonders if this combination of being unlikeable and also anti-Semitic is some accident, or if Hemingway really wanted to make clear that the only characters with even the vaguest sense of honor in the book are Jake, who tolerates the Jewish character, Cohn, and Cohn himself.  At some point, Brett even points out that the rest of the characters are even worse than Cohn despite them making so many digs at his religious background.  One wonders why Cohn even wanted to associate himself with this crowd.<br /><br />But one wonders even more which side of the fence Hemingway came down on.  The novel is based on his own real-life experiences of a trip to Pamplona, so we have to wonder which of the characters really reflects him.  Did he hate Jews, and doesn't realise how unlikeable and hateful his characters are, or are they a means to show the inherent contradictions of the idle aristocrats of the 20s expat community?  One wonders indeed, and it is quite uncomfortable for a modern person to be left wondering along these lines.<br /><br />That said, the writing quality is excellent and is in the typical no-nonsense Hemingway style, but this can be a very emotionally complicated book to read, especially for a Jewish person.  Read it because it's one of those books one ought to read, but don't read it expecting to really enjoy it.
0525953728|4.0|Great book.  I like how the book lead up to the main story by using examples of past missions.  The author also uses terms that are easily understood by the reader.
B0087UN94E|5.0|This album is another breath of life gift from a real human being who knows his vulnerability and honesty is what makes him rock as hard as he does. Every time I listen to Americana I'm more glad to be alive. Thanks Neil.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Used Pinterest before this and found out there was an app. Glad to find it because it's better than using the web.
B002GHHHL0|5.0|I have yet to get to receive this dvd and have been waiting almost two months! I lie this movie but wish i only hd it to watch! My son has been waiting to get this movie too cause itsone of his favorites!
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of Alien. I never was interested in it. What little of it I've seen seems pointlessly violent and filled with stupid choices on the part of the humans involved.<br /><br />I went to see Prometheus with NO idea it had ANYTHING to do with Alien.<br /><br />That being said: the movie is pretty good story-wise.  The story could have been an excellent stand alone beginning to a completely different universe.  In fact, I was actually annoyed when 'Alien' pops up for the first time in a form that non-fans would recognize in the LAST 3 MINUTES of the movie.  Geez. 0_o You could have warned us.<br /><br />I like the movie itself, but it raises more questions than it answers.<br /><br />Also, the humans here make tons of equally stupid choices to those I saw in the snippets of the original alien movies.  (See the Survivalists Quiz 2.0.  That explains most of them.)
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I enjoy playing the game and it helps pass the time.  I will recommend  it to my friends and family  members.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|In much the same spirit that Mario Vargas Lhosa writes, Cloud Atlas was crafted with multiple stories that were and weren't connected to one another.  Stories each offered their own personalities to the overall effect, but were still within their own context when placed next to one another.  This is a very entertaining book, though some may find that the arrangment of several stories to be confusing.
B009329ZF2|4.0|\\"Battleship\\" is a enjoyable movie that should be watched for it's entertainment value alone. There are a lot of plot holes and the [[ASIN:B001FVSZAK Battleship]] game tie-in is just cute, but there is plenty of action and special effects to make this a \\"popcorn\\" movie night standby.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: the movie centers on gifted, but under achieving Navy Lt. Hooper (well acted by Taylor Kitsch), who is facing a less than stellar future. Things definitely change when scheduled War Games get interrupted by alien invaders bent on establishing a foothold in Hawaii.<br /><br />Over analyzing why the aliens didn't use their vastly superior technology in different ways will take the fun out of this feel good movie. I choose to just enjoy the premise, likable characters, good action, and great special effects.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I've enjoyed  playing this one several times through. It has a good storyline. The only short-fall is a lot of back &amp; forth within the story to complete a task. It leaves it open-ended for a sequel. But I look forward to the next one.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Good movie. Interesting plot line and twists. Main characters personality leaves you wondering is she has a split personality. The characters are forgettable, it's the story that makes you want more.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|Lee Child's books have gotten progressively worse.  I promised myself I would not buy any more of his novels after the last one .. and wish I had kept my promise.  His books are now so boring and predictable.  Further, the story line is unclear .. and not sensible.  The characters are not well developed -- and not very believable.  Yikes .. terrible book.  Can't believe it is on the best seller list.  I am certain that there will be other disappointed readers.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I'm pretty sure this author wrote this book when she was love struck at the age of 13.  I don't know of any guys who talks like Travis.  He has some serious issues.  I think the main thing that irked me was all of the nicknames used - Pidge, Mare, Trav, Cookie, Abs - give me a break.  I finished the book and I read it quickly even though it was a 400+ page book but I was rolling my eyes the entire time.  Not the worst book I have ever read but definitely not worthy of 5 stars. I'm glad it was a library book.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I purchased this book for my kindle and couldn't stop reading! Really interesting subject matter and masterfully written. There are some disturbing scenes within the book that unfortunately happen every day. It makes you think.
B000066C6Z|5.0|This is a classic comedy created by the same people who brought you Airplane and Kentucky Fried movie.  If you like sarcastic slap stick comedy, you will love this movie.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I didn't want Prim to die. I didn't want  Finnick to die. But it made the story what it is. Amazing. And I really hope there aren't worse games to play than the Hunger Games.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this game is loads of fun. i just cant stop playing. the graphics are stunning, so colorful and clear. i love it.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Good mindless fun and doesn't cost you a ton of quarters. Great for my son to playor watch while we are in line or waiting for something to start. You can pick it up and put it down in seconds.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Being an action and suspense fan, this movie didn't sooth my savage beast. It started with a bang but began to slow about midway. It became close to boring and the ending was not satisfying. The commercials for this film depicted scenes of treachery and blood lush which enticed me to see it. The film did not delivery. It was fun to watch for a while and worth the 4.99 rental from Amazon but I wouldn't see it again or add it to my library.
B0099G3I96|5.0|This album is a great return for No Doubt. A more mature album but still has elements of Tragic Kingdom and Return of Saturn.
B003204MQS|4.0|The movie I purchase (Paranormal Activity) was a good movie from my point of view ..however the picture was blurry.The movies need<br />more clarity.. what good is it too watch a good movie if it's not clear ..you guys need too work on that ASAP!!!.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I can't believe this EXCELLENT game is free today. We usually never get one this good. The game has great graphics, story line, and music. It's like a heavily upgraded version of BeJeweled (but way better) Highly recommend this game to anyone
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is really well made. Nice graphics and smooth game play. Very good app especially if you like the match 3 type of games.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|easy to play. takes up time<br /><br />it makes you think a little to make the moves.<br />nice little match 3 game.
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|I enjoyed this while it worked.  On DX2 it would crash between each level, but save progress.  Then after finishing the hidden picture game it will crash and not save progress.  Looks like it would be a fun game if I could play it.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a fun game but many of the ads are not from the USA.  I used up my clues quickly.
B00006879E|4.0|I went to the Amazon music store planning to buy Maroon 5's newest release. I still might do that. But so many reviewers were praising their first CD - Songs About Jane - that I decided to purchase that one instead. I've actually just started listening to Adam Levine's music since I began watching The Voice on TV. So, I was amazed by how many of the songs on this CD that I actually was familiar with. I've played it many times and the music keeps on entertaining. I liked it so much that I bought another CD and had it sent to my best friend.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Once the issues with the kindle edition were resolved and i was able to finish the book. it was better than i could have hoped for. this cliff hanger is going to be hard to deal with for another year though.
034580404X|5.0|I have enjoyed book one and moved on to book two now. Im sure all will be just as steamy in the next two books. I have let a co-worker read the first book and was told it was to steamy to read at work. LOL Good Read

B0097EWK3A|4.0|It was pretty good, now I'm waiting on part 2. It kept me interested and on my toes. I'd suggest it to my friends easily.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this novel.  The author has a great concept of seeing the life of this couple through the eyes of the husband, the wife and her diary.  The build up to the \\"twist\\" was really well done, but the ending seemed rushed.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A good wrap up to the trilogy.  Moved very quickly and did get somewhat confusing during the last battle sequence.  All in all a good read.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Love your app, keep up the good work. Looking forward to the next version. Download it, you will not be sorry.
0316228532|4.0|In J. K. Rowling's book Casual Vacancy, we experience the author's release from the restrictions of writing for children. As many authors and actors eagerly admit when they get to go to HBO, it is a relief to swear brazenly and discuss all sorts of questionable topics and not worry about censor.  Rowling's teenage characters exercise great hostility and disillusionment towards the adults closest to them as adult failings are literally advertised one by one. Rowling also takes on the tension ever present between the haves and the have nots and brings up the topic of entitlement so much part of the current presidential debate in the U.S. The novel is a serious look at reality.<br /><br />One of the reviews here on Amazon compared J.K. Rowling's novel to Mapp and Lucia. J. K. Rowling writes more seriously than E. F. Benson or Jane Austen. I don't think Rowling's book carries the delightful humor of E.F. Benson or Jane Austen.  I can't say I enjoyed the foibles of the people I met in Rowling's village as I enjoy the doings of folks E.F. Benson and Jane Austen portray. Rowling's novel will make a great dramatic movie, with a message.  E. F. Benson and Jane Austen create villages and worlds you can return to many times and laugh again at the same jokes and take pilgrimages to Rye and Bath to catch a glimpse at the worlds the authors drew on to write their novels.  Of course, E.F. Benson and Jane Austen are wonderful because their worlds are not so real.
B00684J49U|3.0|While Amazon.com is wonderful about returns, I am now in the process of returning my second Grey's Anatomy Season 8 DVD set because of damaged DVDs. It is disappointing to be in the middle of watching a tv series and be unable to play an entire DVD, all of an episode, or chunks of various episodes, because of damaged DVDs. The quality of the DVDs is what bothers me. Amazon.com is one of my favorite sites for online shopping because their policies are so good. I'm just disappointed that I have to wait another week or 10 days to receive the third replacement set of DVDs. One thing I learned since my last return...don't rush to return the damaged set until you have watched ALL of the replacement set. I could have swapped out DVDs and possibly have had one completely good set between the two. This time I will wait to return the damaged set until I am sure all the replacement DVDs work. Amazon gives you 30 days to return the damaged item without charge.
B008K8U13K|4.0|I was very skeptical about buying a 2D platformer on the Kindle Fire due to the touch screen controls. I'm really glad I took this chance because I have really enjoyed the game so far.<br /><br />The on-screen touch controls are very responsive and to be honest there have only been two or three times where I was touching the wrong area of the digital controller and died as a result. The game is very playable with this control method (I've played the game to the final boss, haven't beaten him yet). You can also change the contorl method to motion movement. You can tilt the Kindle Fire left and right to move Sonic. I used this method for one level and really didn't like it. It worked and was very responsive but it just wasn't for me.<br /><br />One of the things I really liked was that the game saved very often. There are 4 zones and each zone is broken up into 3 levels and a boss battle. After each level or boss the game saves so you can always pick up where you left off if you have to leave or the game crashes (which has happened to me about 3 times). You can also go back and play your favorite levels at any time.<br /><br />This is by far my favorite Sonic game of all time and I will totally be purchasing Episode 2 after I fully complete this game.<br /><br />The reason for 4 stars out of 5 is due to the crashes on the Fire (although I found that if I turn my Fire off and back on it runs a lot smoother). Also due to the lack of Gamecircle support. I have a Fire HD ordered and I really wish I could move my save file to it when I get it. It's not a big deal to start the game over from the beginning but it would be nice to not have to. The last reason is due to it's lack of controller support. The Fire HD supports Bluetooth and the ability to use a Bluetooth controller with this game would be amazing.<br /><br />Overall I love this game and strongly suggest you check it out for yourself.
B001DF68MA|3.0|I had to return this product back to Amazon. This child bike seat did not fit the 2 mountain bikes that we were going to use it on.<br />One bike has a frame size of 15.5\\" (medium size) and the other a has 13\\" frame (small size). Both bikes have a straight seat post and slanted top tube. There just wasn't enough room to fit the child seat in between the back of the stem and the tip of the saddle after the saddle has been pushed as far back as it will go.<br />Other than that, the seat looks well built and plush.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very good Bible app.  I would recommend it to anyone....  Great reminder system and is very User friendly in general.
B004EPYZXU|5.0|This was a terrific, overlooked movie.  I've seen it six times now (twice in the theater, and four times on DVD, plus all of the bonus footage) and have to say that it is one of my favorite sci-fi/horror movies of all time.  Very, very well done, from the acting to the cinematography to the direction and everything else.  If you like the concept, ignore the bad reviews and give it a shot.
B009FZZK8I|5.0|i just watched episode1 of season 3 - really amazing. it's more raw/violent and grittier than ever. the characters are starting to show the strain of being on the run with death at every turn. can't wait for the rest of the season!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is one of those books though while purely fiction will leave you hot , bothered & wanting more !
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing! It really lets the general public know how bin Laden was killed and about the inner workings of the SOF community. I will forever recommend this book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was awesome. It was definitely a step outside of the genre that I normally read but once I got into it I couldn't put the book down. From start to finish it was a page turner.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I found this game to be challenging and fun although a little repetitive.  It works well by showing simple levels in oeder to build toward the more difficult levels.  I found a few levels I haven't solved yet.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was awesome. It was definitely a step outside of the genre that I normally read but once I got into it I couldn't put the book down. It was a little slow starting off with Book 1 but after you get through the beginning you are totally hooked.
B0099G7KDQ|2.0|Very diaspointed with this album.Love Sigh no More, but this album seems flat and bland. The album lack the soul and creativity of the first.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was awesome. It was definitely a step outside of the genre that I normally read but once I got into it I couldn't put the book down. From start to finish it was a page turner.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I read this book because I loved the Harry Potter books.  This book is not nearly as well-written or easy to follow, nor is is nice to read.  There is really not a redeeming person in the book; there is no joy; there is no real redemption.  It is sad and depressing to think that everyone in the world has such serious problems as those that JK writes about here.  I finished it, but had to force myself.
B009NBSEXM|5.0|Emma and Snow are taken prisoners by Mulan and Sleeping Beauty. Regina gains her powers and forces Henry to come back to her home. Sebastian (The Mad Hatter) refuses to help Charming get Emma and Snow back and the seven dwarves discover if you leave town, you lose your Fairy Tale Land memories. And that is just the first ten minutes of the show. This episode showcases Regina's backstory with her mother Queen Cora and with Rumple. How Regina goes from a sweet young woman who just wants her freedom, to evil queen is a path that starts with Rumple. By the end of the episode, Regina realizes she cannot hold Henry hostage if she wants his love and sets him free to live with Charming. Charming talks the town into returning to their Storybrooke lives. And Emma and Snow get dumped into a pit prison with the last person on earth they expect to see.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best item ever give me the opportunity to read your bible anytime anywhere. Can't read, no problem your device can do it for you.<br />Love it.
B009OYTIXS|5.0|At first this show looks like a cross between the latest installment of Batman movies and the show Revenge. But I believe the showrunners are going to give us a thrilling ride that will set it apart from these well loved entities. Stephen Amell stars as the TV series comic book hero whose story will be told in flashbacks throughout the season. A billionaire playboy who loved the night life is on a boat with his dad and in bed on said boat with his girlfriend's sister, when they hit a bad storm. Oliver Queen survives five years on an island and is rescued by a passing fishing boat. When he returns home, his younger sister has taken over his party life, his mother has married another man, and his girlfriend and best buddy are friends with benefits. Queen takes it all in, but focuses on his master plan - taking back his city from the corrupt people who run it. Amell does almost all his own stunts, and the show itself has great production values. It's a fast paced first hour with an unexpected twist at the end. Look for John Barrowman in future episodes.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I just don't get it.  This book is only about sex.  What they do is sex, sex, sex.  I don't think they love each other.  The story is boring...
B009QW5LYS|5.0|Alicia is trying to win an internet lawsuit when Eli warns her that a reporter (the fabulous Miriam Shor) is about to print a story about Alicia and Will's affair. It turns out the story is about Peter and a campaign worker, and Alicia emotionally relives Peter's previous betrayals all over again. Kalinda continues her S&M relationship with her husband, while helping Eli determine if the campaign worker is telling the truth. And Rita Wilson is back as a lawyer trying to get Nathan Lane (as trustee) to intervene in Alicia and Will's case. A great episode with a great ending.
B0095T3H2U|1.0|I thought this movie was boring, stupid, and quite frankly a waste of time.  My daughter and I couldn't even make it through it.  I was very disappointed, I expected a lot more.
B009QWNQ8Q|5.0|Snow recovers from her whack on the head to discover Cora talking to Emma, and immediately goes into protective mother mode. Both ladies get a surprise when the leader of the lost island literally throws them a rope to get out of the pit. It is Snow's old friend Lancelot, and he is glad to help Snow, Emma, Mulan, and Aurora continue on their journey. When an ogre attacks Emma, Snow slays him with an arrow to the eye and the ladies reach their final destination - Snow's castle. The magic portal tree is still there, and Lancelot shows up to help carry the tree back to the lost island. At that point everything goes awry, and Snow and Emma are back to square one. Back in Storybrooke Henry is being hardheaded, and Charming has to save Henry from his own reckless actions. Sebastian (The Mad Hatter) finally reunites with his daughter Grace, and Charming teaches Henry sword fighting, while an old foe watches from his car. There was too little Regina in this episode, but the thought of Regina and Cora going head to head somewhere down the line is extremely tantalizing.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|Cinder: Book One in the Lunar Chronicles was a surprise. Who would have thought that another variation on a worn out theme could be so engaging? The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where cyborgs are second class citizens and a beyond beautiful moon queen can nullify free will with a glance. It's hard to describe the events without spoiling the thoroughly intriguing, fast-paced plot. Although technically a young adult book, I have recommended it to a host of friends and family of all ages. Unfortunately, the Kindle version of the sequel is not available, but I'll be the first to buy it when it arrives.
B007THA4FI|3.0|This was a decent book, not nearly as entertaining as her Harry Potter books.  The problem is that her characters were too cartoonish and none had any redeeming charachteristics so that you wanted them to do well.  It was a bit disappointing.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This makes it so much easier to know how much real time I have to enjoy my kindle before charging it.
B0098VXBIA|1.0|I am not even quite sure why this was a movie. Nothing spectacular happened. I've heard better jokes from people that I don't even like while I eavesdrop on their conversations in the kitchen break room at work. If you just feel like staring at Cameron Diaz being fit, Jennifer Lopez pretending to be but a humble photographer, Elizabeth Banks be beautiful and radiant as usual and Rebel Wilson not given a chance to be the witty, scene-stealing girl we know her to be -- then by all means rent this piece of cinematic failure.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Katniss pregnant?  I did not see that coming.  Looking forward to the last book.  I can't wait to see if Prim becomes a fighter or healer.
0800141660|5.0|The Dashwood sisters (Emma Thompson, Kate Winslett, Emilie Francois) and their mother (Gemma Jones) are left in a precarious position when Mr. Dashwood (Tom Wilkinson) dies and the bulk of his estate goes to his son from a previous marriage (James Fleet), who allows them a very small stipend on which to live.  In a society where women are denied autonomy, they must rely on the kindness of in-laws and pray for advantageous marriages.  Nevertheless, Elinor and Marianne hold on to the hope that they will marry for love and not merely economic gain.<br /><br />This engaging and moving film, brilliantly acted, functions for much of its length as a scathing indictment of a time when the circumstances of talented and intelligent women were almost entirely dependent on the men in their lives.  However, it becomes complicit in this unfortunate social institution (spoiler ahead) with its ending, in which the sisters achieve happiness by marrying the right men.  Nevertheless, I had become so invested in the characters that I wanted them to have their happy ending and didn't much mind that the form it took actually undercut a major theme of the film.
B009B51K9U|4.0|Uno! really reminds me a lot of Green Day's 1994 album Dookie. It's got a similar feel sonically and lyrically. The majority of the songs on the album are straight up pop punk so fans of more progressive Green Day material (ex. American Idiot, 21st Century Breakdown) may not enjoy it as much. Overall it's just a really fun album with the band going back to their roots.
0316044695|5.0|If you have any interest in history, or what's happening right now in America, this book is a great choice.  It is super easy to read, but gives you a different perspective on what our armed forces are going through.  Whether you are for or against war, it doesn't matter.  This book will give you a look into a world many of us don't know.
1439170916|4.0|I found this book after I was diagnosed with lung cancer and I found it to be a fascinating read.  Cancer has an interesting history.  I have not found another book that is more comprehensive in describing cancer and the development of our understanding of cancer's history, biology and treatment.
B0091REZMW|4.0|interesting game. kinda slow at first but so far it definetely challenges the brain.  good hidden quest with plot app.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest easily occupies 3+ hours of my life per day. I love it!! I have found so many great ideas, recipes and DIY projects.
B004X60QE2|5.0|Eureka season 1 was not the first season of this series  I bought. After seeing the show on television, I bought the first season I ran across which was season 4.0. I enjoyed it so much that I decided to go back to the first episodes and see how it all began. The characters are likable and the plots are unique. The writers definitely stepped outside of the box.
B001QJUX24|3.0|This was a great movie, although it was suppose to be the story of Cynthia Ann Parker's re-capture, it did not cover the entire story as I was told it would.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|it works like a bream it is very easy to use wish I had it years ago I use it for work andnkit save me lots of time
B009QW7HMC|5.0|The start off to season 3 left me wanting more. I don't think it could of been any better. The story took an amazing twist. Very good character development and a perfect ending to episode 1. I can not wait for the next episode. I'm not going to spoil the episode for anyone. But you have to watch it for yourself! I was highly impressed and kept at the edge of seat!
B007TK77QE|5.0|With great interest and excitement I began this first non-Potter from Jo Rowling, and it did not disappoint. Both sad and entertaining, it is a social commentary on small town culture and the danger of taking oneself too seriously. Jo has that knack of familiarising you so well with a character in such a short span, that even if you cannot like them, you empathise. One cannot help but become involved, rather then just merely objectively viewing the story as a whole. I hope she keeps writing. I for one, am sold.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Not only does this game make the famous 3-match fun with its vivid colours and unique items, but there is a storyline behind everything you do. let alone that i love Greek mythology and the history does come alive.  If anything you're playing to complete a puzzle and learn some mythology along the way. love it! nice easy play and good instructions when you level up.  great FAOD, amazon!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Admittedly, this was my first venture into hidden object games. But I'm a sucker for mystery games, and Enigmatis proves to be well worth the time and money. It's mystery adventure with an engaging storyline, clever puzzles to solve and clues to piece together. At no time did I find the it boring or tedious. The sound and graphics enhance the dark atmosphere. Playing in expert mode, I found the game sufficiently challenging and fun all the way through. You'll enjoy several hours of gameplay in this one.  Enigmatis made me an instant Big Fish Games fan. I've already recommended it to my friends. I can't wait for the sequel!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I really like this great little app. it has a bejeweled like game and a neat little stotyline. a terrific choice for free app of the day
B008ER9QKG|5.0|It took me a while to get used to the new staging but by the end of \\"Das Rheingold\\" I just loved it. The performances are all at least very good with Eric Owens as Alberich and Debra Voigt as Brunhilde being particular standouts.
B0026OE2NY|3.0|I have no idea what to think about this documentary because you sent me a copy set for the wrong region.<br /><br />So thanks for nothing.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|This is a great movie, lots of twists and pretty unexpected turns. I loved it. It actually starts off pretty slow but once it picked up, it took off. I really enjoyed this movie.
B000PC0SPU|4.0|Having known these beautiful knowledge about the function of the brain, I could convey it to my students to help them making good and efficient designs in the Faculty of Architecture - MTI. Cairo.
B0081L391C|4.0|The end threw me off in a not-so-good way. I did not want or need to see Johnny Depp's face in this movie.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I was excited to get this series.  I watched it all in a day or two.  One of my disks had a small issue but nothing I can't live with.  Shipping was fast.
B004CEUEWE|1.0|This is one of those movies that is so derivative, you can literally start listing the films that Affleck lifted ideas from. Thief is one of them for sure, Heat is another, Ronin, so on and so forth. At least in those movies, the characters have personality and the audience can like them. The characters in The Town are absolutely unmemorable and unlikable. Even bad characters can be sentimental. Affleck just didn't try to make this film better. It's contrived, in every way imaginable. I can't believe so many people like it too. They must not have a Netflix account. Expand your tastes in film, people.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|fun but you must not update it get annoying ads and offers dont get this app it will take your fun get cut the rope instead :)
B009GEEMLY|5.0|fun, exciting. Utilized each character with their strengths. This movie is good for most ages. The young probably will not get some of the terrific humor.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a good version of the classic game. you can change the background and the deck of cards. you can also have the game finish for you if you get all the cards open, i really like that action
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice App got all keys needed for a plain calculator. Good size keys Really easy to use. Highly recomend it.!!!!!!!!
B001I8A76A|2.0|The problem with this album is that there's one real party song, and the rest of the album's kind of a downer. It doesn't give an arch or story to itself so it's just not as good as some of her other albums.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|Delirium was great!  Once I started it, I couldn't put it down.  It was easy reading and pulled me into the book with the characters like I was going through it myself.  I read it so easily, I was into the sequel in a few days (and I hold down a steady job!).  It's a must-read!
B000QRIGLC|4.0|The book was quite interesting. Each time I put it down (Kindle version actually), I looked forward to the next opportunity to read more. I enjoyed hearing the stages of the training and then especially the experience in Afghanistan. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was all the swearing in the book.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I have read all of the Harry Potter series and loved them . This book is boring at the beginning and gets worse.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|By far the best book I 've read in a while. Great storyline...interesting characters.  Fans of Steven King will enjoy these books. I have definitely found an author to add to my list of favs! Well worth the price.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Very entertaining. I'm enjoying every minute of play. I definitely recommend getting this game.  Hadn't played in a while, forgot how much fun it is.
B0051HNMTI|5.0|I enjoy this app so much that Im actually going to buy it! (Ive NEVER bougt an app before) Its simple, direct, and, if done propery, feel like you did a good workout in 5 minites!
B008XG1X18|5.0|very easy to use... I love being able to see all the categories and things I've pinned. this is as easy to use as pulling up pinterest on my Pc.
B0036UO56G|5.0|I had seen this before, years ago.  I loved it then and I love it still.  Now that I own it, I'll watch it over and over.  Great acting, great singing and a real tear-jerker!  Don't miss this one!
B00008QSA5|4.0|Good CD, I liked most of the songs. Compared to today music it did seem to date itself but that was to be expected.
1401233791|4.0|DC smartly re-printed this storyline to coincide with the release of the new Batman film [[ASIN:B004LWZWGA The Dark Knight Rises (+Ultraviolet Digital Copy)]]. The prominent villain of the movie is a character called Bane, and this massive TPB collects the first appearances and origin story of that character. Whether you've seen the new movie or not, you'll enjoy reading the original Batman story of Bane's creation and rise to power. (The new film does a pretty good job of sticking to the origin of the character, while editing things a bit to make the story more grounded in reality.) The book's stories are mostly written by Chuck Dixon, who is also the creator of Bane. The book also showcases the \\"replacement\\" Batman, Jean Paul Valley - a character who originally went by the name of Azrael. If you are interested in reading more about the origin of that particular character, I would recommend picking up the book [[ASIN:156389100X Batman: Sword of Azrael (Prelude to Knightfall)]].<br /><br />As I mentioned, this book is enormous and will take you some time to completely read through. You may be able to find a copy at a local library, but I still think this is an excellent addition to your own home library. Artwork is done by a variety of artists, so the overall look of the book isn't consistent, and the artwork is not terribly impressive when compared to the great artwork seen in comic books of the present day, but what else are you going to expect from stories of twenty years ago?<br /><br />I do have one minor complaint. These days, when you purchase a new comic trade, you pretty much expect the story to be printed on high-quality paper. That isn't the case with this book. Rather than being printed on high-quality glossy stock paper (like the other classic Batman story [[ASIN:1401232280 Batman: No Man's Land, Vol. 1]] that was recently re-printed), this story is printed on the same paper used in the DC Showcase series of collected editions. This was disappointing, as nothing looks as vibrant as it could have, and I think this paper is likely to degrade more quickly. I suppose it was done to keep the cost down and increase profits, but it feels a bit like a diss to the fans who are likely to pick up this book.<br /><br />If you enjoy this book, make sure to pick up the second part [[ASIN:1401235360 Batman: Knightfall, Vol. 2: Knightquest]] and third part [[ASIN:1401237215 Batman: Knightfall, Vol. 3: Knightsend]], as well.s nothing looks as vibrant as it could have, and I think this paper is likely to degrade more quickly.

B000002VMH|5.0|Diva is another top 20 all time CD for me, if I had to go to an island with only a few CDs, this would be one.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Kept my interest and it was pretty true to original storyline. I would recommend it to others to see if they like adventure/mystery/action
B0016OMFNY|5.0|I bought it when it came out and I still love it. No bad songs here. This is a treat.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I loved the album Babel. It is exactly what I expected out of Mumford and Sons and I couldn't be more happy. Also, this album cost me a total of $5.99 because I had a $5.00 credit towards any Mp3 purchase so that was a plus!
B000001EG6|5.0|this Elton John live is a top 20 all time live album for me. What a gem. If you don't have this you are missing something.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was captivated by the book and enjoyed the twist at the end. It makes you really think about the characters.
B00007FOMP|5.0|This Marvin Gaye masterpiece is top 5 all time for me. Period. One of those if I had to choose albums for a small deserted island.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|Bob Dylan has gotten a bit more gravely of voice and but the poetry is still the same. As you get older the topics may change as they have with Bob,but the intensity is still there.
B000002HEM|5.0|I love this live performance. Agree with a reviewer who puts it up there with some other classics \\"Live at Leeds\\" \\"Frampton\\".
B008XG1X18|5.0|so easy to use and convenient. love it! perfect for when you want to just use your phone or tablet.
B008Y5OW20|1.0|This album is terrible!  Jeff's singing is tired and lacks the lift his songs have provided in the past.  It is unfortunate that after the many years of waiting for another Jeff Lynne solo album that this is the best he could do.
B007ZMAL32|5.0|I like Sabaton for their melodies and the singer's voice, as well as the subject matter they sing about.<br /><br />Carolus Rex was a trip through Swedish military history, set to some great music and powerful vocals. I liked the departure from WWII, and found the spotlight on Swedish militarism very cool and interesting.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|This is a great album, and if I keep listening to it in the car I am gonna get a speeding ticket.
B007G51UV0|1.0|I used this motherboard for my new I7 system.  everything when super smooth for the initial startup.  No problems for the first two days.  Then I noticed that web sites started to take longer and longer to load.  First thought it was Comcast.  I then did a speed test and found that while my download speeds were normal, the upload speed was terrible.  I installed a NIC card from my old machine and my speeds were immediately restored.  The motherboard has an on-board network plug that I was using.  This part of the board failed first.  The next day I lost my sound.  Tried reloading drivers, removing all components and reinstalling, you name it I tried.  Tough to play games on my gaming rig without sound.  I didn't mind solving the network issue with a NIC card, but for what I paid didn't feel I should have to buy a sound card.  Called ASUS support and they verified the board to be faulty.  Called Amazon and they credited my account right away (hats off to Amazon).  Repurchased a second motherboard.  I like Asus and while this board was working, it was great.  So I am going to give it another shot.  Will update with replacement experience.  Too bad after spending almost $1800 for my new rig and hours setting it all up I have to go thru this trouble.  I had my case all setup looking great with my wire management, very proud of my work, and now I have to tare it all out.  Remove my CPU heat sync, clean up the thermal paste and start all over.  Meanwhile I have to wait for the replacement.  Not very nice.  Oh yeah I now have the privilege of taking the time to send the broken board back just to ensure my refund.<br /><br />**********************<br />UPDATE:<br />I have lowered my rating to one star.  This board has a premium price tag so you would think that all the options on the board should work.  I have tried 3 replacements and all had the same problem with the onboard gigabit LAN connections.  Great download speeds but no upload speeds resulting in very slow web page loading.  Amazon was great in taking everyone back free of charge and sending me a replacement.  I will continue to use Amazon for shopping because of their great customer service,  Asus on the other hand is another story.  As you can see below Asus responded to my first review and asked that I contact him.  Well I did just that and waited for a response.  Had to send a second email to get a reply back.  His efforts to help solve my troubles were less than satisfactory and in the end he stop his communications with me.  So after numerous attempts to get a fully functional motherboard and lots of practice reinstalling all my hardware I have less than a perfect board.  I'm done with attempting another replacement.  I only hope as time goes on that I don't lose my sound again or find another option I have yet to explore not work when I want to use it.<br /><br />********************<br />UPDATE:<br />Attempted to update BIOS to current.  Three hours and a ton of blue screens of death later I got lucky.  After repeated attemps and being forced to pull the CMOS battery to recover the Bios screen I got lucky.  Was about to give up and return this board for a new and different manufacture.  I am tired of fixing this and have decided to throw in the towel.  Its up and running very well now, but what a long journey to get here.<br /><br />It doesn't matter how nice this board is now that its up and running.  The pains to get here out weigh its benifit.  Buy a different model or use a different manufacture.  If I didnt know as much as I do about building a PC I would not have been able to get this running.<br /><br />Asus P8Z77-V Pro<br />I7 3770K<br />Hyper 212 cooler<br />Samsung 830 256 SSD<br />EVGA 660Ti SC 3GB<br />Corsair 1600 16G<br />Seasonic X750 gold<br />Asus optic drive<br />Corsair 550D case<br />Asus 25\\" LED monitor
B0092W59VW|5.0|Heard these folks on NPR, then listened to them on Spotify. Immediately went and downloaded \\"Algiers\\" and \\"Carried to Dust\\". Both were a source of delight for hungry ears. I have been listening to these cds off and on for the past two weeks and wow. Just wow. Both are great cds.
B008I3R2VG|5.0|Just a straight solid album from the Killers. Once again, the new album has a different sound than the rest of their portfolio, but manages to still proudly proclaim that this is a Killers album.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is fun. I enjoy the twist of a match 3 with dropping artifacts to the bottom to complete.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I really liked the story in this book and thought that the characters were well developed. Worth reading for sure.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|Ridley Scott takes us once again on a dark journey to an alien planet that may be even darker than ALIEN.  Not only is the planet ominous and foreboding, but the space vehicle itself offers little refuge from the outside world.<br />Initially planned as a prequel to the ALIEN franchise, Scott decided to explore the origin of man, constructing a bold scenario to offer one possibility.  Parts of the script seem convoluted and while Noomi Rapace generates some thespian fireworks, Sigourney Weaver's Ripley is too iconic to compare.<br />PROMETHEUS  is a visually stunning movie and the creature effects are fascinating and repulsive.  Michael Fassbender as the android David is excellent and Charlize Theron oozes ice as the evil corporate entity.  Logan Michael Green and Idris Elba lend good support, while Guy Pearce is unrecognizable in a small but pivotal role.<br />Two more PROMETHEUS films are planned which may answer some of the unanswered questions in this film.<br />PROMETHEUS is good film making that is also thought-provoking.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Although it was a pretty pink color and case was very sturdy and durable i was unable to use it for the kindle i ordered it with... The new kindles are bigger than the old one's and so i am stuck with a case that i coould not use. On the brighter side, it was a good buy and maybe i give it to some  one for an x-mas gift.
B00887490Y|1.0|Don't let the marketing fool you.  THE TALL MAN is not a horror movie.  Its really a pompous and contrived social commentary on the haves and the have-nots and not a very good one.<br />Set in the Pacific Northwest in a dying mining town called Cold Rock, the story focuses on the disappearance of several children, possibly the victims of the town's resident boogeyman, The Tall Man.  Jessica Biel continues to prove she is an actress of limited skills, wandering through the film like a wayward zombie.  Even good actors like Stephen McHattie, William B. Davis, Jonelle Ferland and Samantha  Ferris seem listless and disinterested.  Even after suffering the film's plodding pacing, the supposed \\"twist\\" at the end doesn't pay off.  THE TALL MAN is ultimately a misguided attempt to bend genres that fails miserably.
B008FQ1O1K|5.0|Wonderful book - insightful and easy to read. I love Mitch Alboms ability to convey deep important life lessons in such  an easy to read interesting fictional tale.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I thought it was great . good puzzles and a great story line. some of the stuff is a little harder than others. but all in all it is a great game
0307887448|1.0|The more I think about this book, the less I like it. Which is too bad because as far as I can tell I am the target demographic for this book.<br /><br />This is the story: The hero, comes up from nothing in a dystopian society and on his wits ascends to a better position and then goes on a quest for fortune (spoiler: the hero finds the gold). Bad guys are bad, okay?  But luckily the hero has a magic bag of tricks that allow him to complete his quest and overcome the not very thrilling or scary jeopardy he finds himself in.  In the end he gets the girl and teaches us all an after school special lesson about how appearance don't matter, it's what's inside the person that counts. That's the entire story.<br /><br />The rest is chock full of often unreadable detail of various pop culture and geek/tech references from the past 40 years. The author couldn't even be bothered to fill in fake details for things between 2010 and 2045, he stuck entirely to the 80s and 90s and mostly TV, movies and video games.  If internet culture memes got together and wrote a book it would be as empty and colorful as this was: all referential and no actual content.<br /><br />I wish I could make a compelling case that the author was mirroring the hero's journey on the stories he so often references (Star Wars, The Matrix, LoTR), but he doesn't even do a good enough job of storytelling to make that even the least bit likely.  I wish there had been some genuine puzzles and riddles for the reader to try and undo as they read along. It was just such a flat, not nuanced, black and white, good vs. bad story that I'm shocked at the number of recommendations I got to read this. It works, I suppose, as adolescent escapism sci-fi, but it lacks any real hallmark of good sci-fi.  It does not make you think, nor give much opportunity to explore or question what you already know.  There's no commentary or insight in this story, in the continual pop culture references, in any of it.<br /><br />The writing is bland at best, stilted at its worst points (which are mostly endless exposition).  If Cline continues to write, I hope some sits him down and explains what \\"show, don't tell\\" actually means. The myriad pop culture references would have been infinitely more enjoyable if it was just lines from books and moves and hints that would allow me to piece together the sources, rather than the author c&p-ing the entire Wiki entry in 80s TV and movies into the text.  Bleh.<br /><br />I guess I'm just really disappointed by how much hype this book has gotten. There's no suspense, no drama, no mystery, no actual romance, nothing thrilling, titillating or curiosity inducing in the entire story.is bland at best, stilted at its worst points (which are mostly endless exposition).

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was highly intriguing and unashamedly critical of the government and those in charge.  Great to read and highly recommend
B0085MNZ66|4.0|Cute little handheld logic game.  Challenging after the initial \\"training\\" levels.  Each section introduces new twists to keep it interesting.  Sometimes difficult to maneuver on a small screen with a finger.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The relationship between Ana and Christian is one of lust and true love. Two individuals deeply committed and dependant on one another's sincere passion for each other. You see the characters grow and morph into beautiful people wanting more...  II loved every moment of this book (and entire trilogy!) Looking forward to the movies. =)
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Fun game not to hard. So far lots of fun best game of it kind out there i got it free
0307730697|5.0|Have read many books about SEALs.  This book is one of the best books I have ever read. Period. I do not like to read. This is the first book where I found myself unable to put down.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great book! Pulls you right in and gets you engaged in the story. I love all of Ken Follett's books, especially the Pillars of the Earth series. This one looks to be just as great. Can't wait for the next book in the series.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I don't know what I expected, but was rather sad after reading this book. I expected so much more.  The writing was fine, and the intertwining of the characters was good, but just too English for me, I guess. My personal opinion would ask that the author should stick to fantasy. I am glad I read it but will not be on my re-read list.
B001W79MB8|5.0|I bought this expecting an entertaining, action-filled shonen flick, but what I got instead was something that was much stronger than I had anticipated.<br /><br />While it -is- very classically shonen, the characters are surprisingly deep and three-dimensional, and I found myself caring about them - even the villains. The story isn't incredibly original but it does have a few ideas, and it serves well enough to show the characters in multiple lights.<br /><br />The animation is absolutely gorgeous and fluid, particularly the fight scenes. The backgrounds are beautiful enough that I would happily hang them on my wall, and even weather effects are done very well (the snow is especially well-done).<br /><br />I would like to give special attention to the music, because not only does it fit every scene it's in, it enhances the entire movie and the emotions each scene brings out. Fierce drums get your adrenaline flowing and string and wind instruments alternately bring you into the world and pull on your emotions to bring you further into the story. The music during the climax is particularly stirring, and you'll find yourself turning it up multiple times.<br /><br />On the subject of sound, I watched the Dub, and I was quite happy with every voice actor and the effort put into each performance. Of special note is that the boy is played by an actual child rather than an adult woman (as is often found in anime), and he puts in an impressive performance - I learned he's the son of two voice actors, so I suppose it runs in the family! I didn't listen to the Sub, but I don't think anyone will have a problem with the Dub at all - it's all very professional and full of care and emotion.<br /><br />Overall, I'd suggest this movie to any fan of not only anime, but action movies in general. It's an enjoyable ride that will pull you in more than you think, and after it's over you'll find yourself wanting to watch it again - that sort of pull is exactly what makes a movie worth owning rather than renting, and I'm definitely happy that I've added this to my collection.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Finally a FAOTD that is cool and has no crazy permissions!  Playing on my Kindle Fire for about 45min now with no problems.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book continues the Hunger Games Trilogy (Second Book).  It is lengthy but worth the read if you enjoyed the first book.

0316227706|5.0|I've already made the decision that most of my friends and family will be getting a copy of Underwater Dogs for Christmas this year. Regardless of whether or not you're a dog lover, you can't help but to smile as you flip through this book. The photos inside range from hilarious to something that could be considered fine art. The owners of the dogs photographed must be forever grateful to have such amazing shots of their pets. Well done, Seth.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This was one of the most epic movies I have ever seen.  I must have watched it a minimum of 10 times.  I am Awestruck!
B008476HBM|5.0|I read this for the umpteenth time on the PC Kindle, and the formatting seemed fine to me, so maybe it's been sorted by now. Either that or I was so bedazzled by the story that I simply didn't notice any problems.<br /><br />A librarian once remarked to me, upon my commenting how few people were in the library that particular day, that if people had to pay to gain access the line would be around the block. This seemed to me to display a wise understanding of human nature.<br /><br />Just because something is free does not mean it is worthless, any more than there being a guarantee that something costing a lot is bound to be valuable. The reason this book is always free on Kindle is that it is long out of copyright. This fact alone shows that it has stood the test of time, along with Jane Austen's other novels.<br /><br />Many people shy away from reading so-called classic novels. They feel that they will be full of long descriptions or such dated language that the narrative will be impossible to penetrate. To anyone reading this book for the first time, therefore, the writing will be a revelation. It is perceptive and witty in its social commentary, and full of interesting, sympathetic (and sometimes unsympathetic) characters who remain forever in the memory.<br /><br />The story itself is the great-great-great-grandmother of all romances, even predating Jane Eyre, which so many people liken to Mills & Boon or Silhouette romances. The heroine and her hero are real, flawed people rather than cardboard cutouts. When you consider that Jane Austen's settings and characters genuinely reflect her own time (the late 18th/early 19th century), rather than being researched in modern times, there is added interest from both cultural and historic perspectives.<br /><br />If you have never read this novel, regarded by many as the writer's best, please don't pass  on it this time. Not only is it a wonderful experience in itself, but it may open for you literary doors to other fascinating worlds that you have kept firmly closed until now. If you have already read it once, of course, this review is preaching to the converted, for you have probably done so several times, with its charms only increasing with every reading.cinating worlds that you have kept firmly closed until now.

B003YUC2FE|5.0|My son loved these movies. Not only did he love them but the entire family loved it. These movies will be loved for a long time. Thank you
0345522478|5.0|I am very selective about the works I read because nothing upsets me more than purchasing a book and not making it past the second chapter before giving it away.<br /><br />That is definitely not the case with this book!<br /><br />Growing up, I read a lot of science fiction (mainly Heinlein) but never really got into the fantasy books until I joined the Navy and a friend lent me his Dragonlance Chronicles.  I never strayed outside of the world of Krynn until Riordan came along with his Percy Jackson/Heroes of Olympus/Kane Chronicles.  From there, another friend practically begged me to read the first Dresden book and by the time I finished with the third book, I bought the whole series right then and there.<br /><br />Well...after my second read-through of that series, I was thirsty for more of modern day fantasy cloaked in reality type books.  On a hunch, I purchased this book and wow, was I amazed!  I'm not even halfway through book one and I've already bought the entire series.<br /><br />Hearne does a fantastic job challenging the reader with exposure to Celtic mythology.  I've stopped a few times to do some independent research on the subject just so I can better understand the storyline (everyone is all too familiar with Greek, Roman and Eygptian mythology).  Besides the Dresden Files, this is the only other book that has literally gotten me to laugh out loud while reading it.<br /><br />I'm having a hard time forcing myself to slow down and really enjoy the book but it's so engrossing that I usually end up reading five or six chapters when I have a strict one chapter before bedtime policy.<br /><br />In my opinion, Hearne has hit a grand slam with this book and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of this series.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|This is a very handy app when you need to jot something quick.  It is also helpful when you need to use nonstandard characters.  You can incorporate small drawings and such.
B006ON41FC|3.0|I love this game but does it really half to be this much mony. I think it should be free.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Great movie! A must see for this type of movie.  My kids and I really enjoyed the action and special effects.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is awesome I'm only fifteen so I guess it depends on how old you are and what kind of games you like
B008BIZ06M|3.0|I got \\"lucky\\" and scored this album for $5.00. Well to be more specific anyone who pays more than that would be considered unlucky because it only has $5.00 worth of good songs on it. Half the album is great and then there's 3 songs that I have to say WTF. 1.) Track 6 'Cruising California' feels like a parody on the \\"my hump my lady lump song\\", if you like that kind of garbage you'll like this song. 2.) Track 8 OC Guns, again comon guys this is awful, half the song is in Spanish, the beat to it feels like a mix between Mexican and American R&B, definitely not what I'm looking for in The Offspring. So, if you're one of the, apparently many who like Offspring's mainstream stuff like 'pretty fly for a white guy' you'll probably enjoy those 2 songs. Moving on 3.) Track 9 'Dirty Magic' actually, this song is awesome, so why pick on it you ask? Because, it's the exact same song and as far as I can tell version as the song Dirty Magic on the album Ignition. Overall, I like the album and I deleted the 2 songs I hated from my mp3 list.
B008PNBU30|3.0|I have never considered an entire TDG album to be 5 STARS. Sure, they have great singles; Home, Riot, Never Too Late... but once all the singles are burned up, what's left is just filler -- enough to get the singles on an album. Tracks like \\"On My Own\\" and \\"Drown\\" aren't bad... they're just not that good. That's what this album is, not bad, just not that good. It's like all the songs you were never crazy about, jazzed up, polished a little, accompanied by unnecessary synthesizers, and stuck together on \\"Transit of Venus\\" (huh?).
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|love love love i was only going to give it a quick try now an hour later and im still playing. give it a try and you'll  see for yourself.
B008XG1X18|4.0|its the best thing ever. its so so so so so so so so so so so so so so good.: - )......
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy this game. Its a great way to pass the time. I would recommend this game to someone who loves to play card games.
B008VBYN80|2.0|stopped working once I got to a certain point in the game. I uninstalled; installed and had to restart from the beginning.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This movie is one of my 10-year-old daughter's favorite movies.  She laughs out loud all the way through it.  Great message, great singing, great characters is spit of their flaws.  Sprited and hilarious take on Rapunzel.  She never gets tired of it...actually, neither do I.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love the book it made me mad could not put it down and would read it over and over and over
B0098VYKSA|5.0|Loved the movie. Great video and audio quality. No streaming issues. Wonderful customer service when needed. Spoke to someone who's actually from my country...
B003BW0CB6|5.0|The reversal is a very intense courtroom drama with plenty of mystery and good investigative techniques. I  found it hard to put down as the writer keeps you interested thru out  book. I enjoyed it as much if not more than the Lincoln Lawyer.
B009AJDDQU|1.0|Trite and boring. This movie should have and could have been very interesting. The dialogue was extremely contrived and the screenplay was very poorly executed. Having such a profound concept on which to base this film, I feel that the writers fell short on almost all fronts. This movie ended where it began, taking the audience nowhere.
0061142026|5.0|I read Stardust two years ago, and really loved it. I don't know why I haven't reread it sooner. It's an amazing fantasy, and though I said I haven't read much adult fantasy (in my review of The Magicians), this is probably considered an adult fantasy. Stardust reads like a fairy tale or fable. It's the story of young Tristan Thorn, who lives in the town of Wall, named for the wall separating it from Faerie. Tristan will do anything to win the cold and beautiful Victoria's heart, even fetching a fallen star from Faerie. But everything, including the star, turns out to be more complicated than he imagined.<br /><br />I love Gaiman's descriptions, I love his characters, I love everything about this wonderful novel. It may start out a little slowly, but it's well worth a few hours, and is one of those amazing fantasies that have such a great feel to them (like The Neverending Story or perhaps The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho.) I would recommend it to everyone who's looking for a short but sweet read.<br /><br />You can read all of my reviews at my blog (novareviews.blogspot.com.)
B004XN3FHA|5.0|Very happy.  I ordered the 800 lumens version listed on amazon but it came as the updated version with the 860 lumens output.  Nice suprize.  dont know why i never had a nice flashlight like this but will never not have one now.  well worth the money, thing is like a spotlight.  good to keep in the car too in case some weirdo comes up to you at night you can totally disorient them. Cant believe they can make a flashlight that is this small and bright off of AA batts. Awesome.
0451232852|5.0|Just one of those books you can't put down.<br />I didn't think he could pull it off again,<br />after Pillars of the Earth and World without<br />end, but he did.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Brilliant film. Not a lot of objectionable material. Not a family movie at the same time. Certainly depicts corrupt systems as corrupt systems. Liam Neeson is awesome. His dialogue is awesome. His brain is awesome. Want to watch it again.
B00005JNQS|4.0|While the story is very predictable, I have always been drawn to the artistic side of the animation. Beautiful colors and sets. If you can get past the cookie cutter plot you will find a rewarding film with a good message that most kids love.
B000NQRE1E|4.0|I recently watched \\"titanic\\" in blu-ray, and was very impressed. I was taken to the world of titanic, and felt more involved. The picture is wonderful, and the audio captures the music, sounds of the sea, and dialogue of the characters in a outstanding manner. The special features include  2.5 hours of never-before-seen footage, deleted scenes, interviews, and more. A treat for lovers of \\"titanic\\".
B00004XPPB|5.0|Always put off watching this one for whatever reason. Well boy was I blown away. This movie is right up there in the Good Fells, Godfather I & II pantheon.<br />Al Pacino was perfect as the low level gangster. He kept is overacting in check and was phenomenal. Johnny Depp and Ann Heche were also excellent.<br />Great movie! I only wish I had seen it sooner!
B00005M2CP|4.0|I gave the set four stars because the movies themselves are great.  The video transfer was not very good.  The packaging says they're in widescreen format and they don't appear to be.  I recommend getting the Cappolla Restoration.  I wish I did.
B00007BKVC|5.0|Another movie I never got around to watching. The photography is stunning and Susan Sarandon is excellent.<br />This movie has held up well and probably could have been done today and still worked.<br />Even Harvey Keitel is great in this one as the lone good guy in a sea of creeps.<br />Ridley Scott did a great job on this one!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|best User friendly calculator I have found. please don't ask for so many words to describe a simple app such as this.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|Has all of the elements I love, great, interesting characters who stretch themselves personally, good back stories, a loveable protagonist and some delightful maxims explored along the way.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Somehow there are two ads that keep show up even after uninstalling this program for a pool game and a racing game. I guess I need to buy an adware program now.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Amazon recommended this based on previous books I'd read. I was a little skeptical, despite all the positive reviews.... But I was up for an adventure. It was well worth it. Book 1 had me hooked! The storyline is interesting and moves forward well, and importantly, the characters are well-developed, multi-dimensional and I found myself reading on and on just to find out what happens to them. I can't wait to read book 6, the prequel.
1423165691|5.0|After Randomly ordering this with my average load of school books I was not really sure of the quality that the book would be. I got it in the mail a few days ago and I cant stop looking at it. If you are an animator or an artist You should really consider buying this book. It does not have any writing or descriptions in who how or what is going on in each page but it does give you an abundance of original Disney roughs. This book is exactly what it says it is, A \\"Sketch Book\\" But it is filled with sketches from some of the most talented Disney artist in their prime. It shows the underlining Art of what makes Disney movies.  I highly recommend this book.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I would rate this game 5 stars but there was no instruction on a few levels and it took a bit to figure out.  All in all, it's a great way to pass the time and great FAOTD.
B0083Z614S|5.0|What can I say?  It's a classic.  If you didn't get a chance to read this book as a child, or to a child, read it to yourself now.  I don't re-read books as a general rule, but I will read this one again.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|3rd time watching the movie. Kids and I just love it, can't wait for part 2. Great gift for my son who can't stop acting like The Hulk..
B008I34ZFW|5.0|Ok, yes, this wasn't a major block-buster film, it was a B film. But it was an AWESOME B film. I loved it, I loved how just ridiculous it was and thought it was an excellent political commentary to boot. If you're a movie buff, you must see this. But you really have to appreciate how BAD some movies can be and how some movies are awesome for being so bad. Definitely worth buying for me, I'll watch it over and over. Nazis in space who have never seen a black person vs Sarah Palin as president. <--Genius!
B004J4X32U|5.0|I can't recommend this book more highly. It is very straightforward and practical and most points are backed up by evidence with good explanations. I have tried some of the recommendations with my toddler and they really do work. Moreover, the book gives me a sense of peace about how to deal with tantrums and bad moods effectively (compassionately but with clear limits), and to view difficult family moments as opportunities for learning. The principles work for adults too!
B009NQKPUW|2.0|First: the sets and special effects are beautiful, so praise goes to the artists and tech creators. That said: Humans this stupid would not have lived to carry their genes into space! And except for the robot, the inarticulate actors chosen as \\"scientists\\" would have been better cast as members of a futuristic motorcycle gang. Someone else (one star) has gone to great lengths to detail the scientific stupidity of the script. Why, when the filmmakers obviously had a gigantic budget to work with, did they scrimp on professional consultation? Prometheus could have been intelligent and thought-provoking - even moving - were it not for the ignorant script writers. It's pretty hard movie to sit through without cursing at the screen if one is a natural scientist or archeologist (as i am), as none of the basic protocols are followed - or even the dictates of basic common sense! In spite of all this, I thought the movie's premise was exciting and fun, and I even liked it overall by what I thought was a rather graceful end. But hold on! Scott (?) just couldn't resist a final, totally gratuitous, gross scene - proving that all these years as a director have brought little maturity.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is a great time waster and it is good if you are a creative person it has all kinds of ideas from food all the way to tattoos
1476712042|5.0|I didn't have high expectations for this book.  I just read 50 Shades Trilogy 3 X (and listened to it as well - both are great!).  I just read the Bared to You series (so far).  While worth reading, Bared to You is about 50% of the 50 Shades Trilogy.  The people have to resonate in a believable way and I suppose in my favorite books/series, I fall \\"in love\\" with the couple. Sounds strange, but I guess that's true - very few authors can get me to really buy into their characters. I won't forget 50 Shades, I won't forget this book.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is just that - unforgettable - it's not super long, and not extremely detailed (I still wonder exactly what Abby looks like)the things Jamie McGuire says about Abby and Travis resonate and ring true to me...they sound exactly like people I know and yet have their individuality.  This is not a cookie cutter romance and some parts of this, break my heart.  I can't wait until her next book \\"Walking Disaster\\", due in 4/13 which is Travis' point of view!! It will be great!!!!! (Stephenie Meyers really made a mistake not finishing \\"Midnight Sun\\" (Edward's POV) what she had written was awesome!  WE WANT THEIR POV!!!!  I buy very few books anymore, I purchase ebooks and Audible (if I love the ebook, I buy the Audible version and always, always hear things I don't read for some reason....worth it!).  But, if I love it, like this one, I have to own it...in physical form and I'll buy this one.  Definitely worth it, you won't forget Pidge and Trav!
B00910Y1OQ|1.0|I was downloading it at 11 30 am then it is 4 30 pm now so that's five hours.  I hate games like this I haven't even got to play it so they need to fix that and yes if you were asking I do have wifi
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I was completely addicted to this book. I had planned on using it as a \\"spare time\\" book to read during slow times at work, waiting for school pickup, etc but instead I found myself absolutely glued and finished it in just a few days. Someone called it an adult hybrid of Harry Potter and Twilight, I loved all those books and I would have to say that description is fairly accurate. But that should not deter you from reading this, that description is only more proof that this is a must read!
B00499K9E0|5.0|It's twelve hours after watching the third episode of the first season and I still can't stop thinking about this show.  I don't have the patience or attention span for television and movies - I get bored easily.  Unfortunately, the generous 90 minutes accorded to these episodes passes all too quickly.<br /><br />Visually, this is beautifully done - not only are the transition shots amazing, but the camera angles are carefully planned - we're seeing exactly what the director wants us to see.<br /><br />The characters are equally well thought-out.  Sherlock is completely believable - he could easily be a caricature, but he makes sense - his emotions and logical world work.  (High-functioning Asperger's is my guess.)  John is perfect as the ballast - he pulls toward a more compassionate view, but he's not a man of words.  The writers get the relationship between these two men exactly right - this is not touchy-feely, but the depth is there.<br /><br />Finally, I truly appreciate British violence standards in their television programming - people are killed - quite often, and sometimes in rather awful ways - but we don't have to see it.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi picolet has written another masterpiece. It was always with regret that I put the book down! For weeks after I read this the content haunted me and certainly gave the reader lots to reflect upon ....

B0098VYCCE|4.0|Enjoyed this rendition of a classic. Was a little hard to follow in parts but other wise good. Will watch again.
1432794426|5.0|\\"Defending a King\\" has even more behind the scenes stories than before. While her respect for Michael Jackin's superb outgoing entertaining ability along with his reticent private persona and philantropic ways can arguably lead to this book being charged to be one sided, Dr. Karen Moriarty has unapologetically wanted it thus. She quotes F.Scott Fitzgerald, \\"Show me a hero and I'll write you a tragedy\\". This is a book that Jackson fans can trust as they look for more information. This is a book for people who enjoy biographies of all kinds.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I know that many people did not enjoy this movie because of major plot holes and whatnot. But I feel it leaves an openness in the movie for each individual to think a little deeper about the meaning.  If you're looking for something to shut your brain off to, you'll miss a lot, and have a bad time.  The visuals are insanely stunning, and the work of Michael Fassbender is phenomenal.  The music really sets the tone of the movie.  Give it a shot, turn on your brain, and enjoy.

B004ZJZQBK|4.0|++ STORY & BACKGROUND ++<br />Wanted is a film based very loosely on a comic book miniseries of the same name. If you go in as a fan of the comic expecting a perfect translation, then you will be disappointed.<br /><br />The movie was heavily modified from its comic book roots to be tailored for the mainstream audience. Some of the characters, such as Wesley & Fox, were created with Eminem and Halle Berry in mind and their personalities reflect this while other characters either switched places or were molded together. Some of the changes are significant such as leaving out a more detailed explanation of the fraternity, the super-villian angel, etc.<br /><br />The movie does stand proudly on its own merits. It is filled with many action scenes and tense interactions between the characters.<br /><br />++ ACTING ++<br />The acting is what you expect in a film. They play up Angelia Jolie's sex appeal including advertising a scene where you briefly see the naked backside of her character for a split moment who, turns out, was a butt stunt double.<br /><br />++ QUALITY ++<br />The quality of the film is an excellent transfer let it be on DVD or Blu-Ray. I do enjoy the slow motion bullet curving in the 3D edition of the film.<br /><br />++ DISC EXTRAS ++<br />Depending upon which version of the film you pick up, there can and are plenty of extras for you to be had from extended scenes to an alternate opening.<br /><br />++ CONCLUSION ++<br />A definite must have for any film buffs collection especially if you are a fan of action/adventure films.

B003VANOFY|1.0|I've never had a headset break so quickly before, and I try my best to take care of my electronics.  This headset, within the first month, had problems with the microphone arm losing its ability to maintain a position.  Over time the arm actually cracked and I've just recently had to replace the headset less than 10 months after receiving it as a gift.  I tried to contact Logitech support while the problems were first emerging, but they keep ridiculous European hours which makes it quite difficult for those of us who work for a living to get in touch.<br /><br />In addition to the problems with the microphone arm, the sound quality on these was less than impressive.  Periodic audio distortion, drop outs and artifacts throughout the course of its life made this unit less than ideal.  I even had the headset adapter within 1' of the headset and the audio issues persisted.  It wasn't interference from other sources, as I tried turning off every bluetooth, wireless, cell phone and other RF device in the house and the issues still persisted (and we're well out of range of our neighbors' wireless networks).<br /><br />Ultimately, for the price, I am extremely disappointed.  Logitech was always my first choice for gaming gear, but I can't say I will buy another Logitech headset after this.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I was so confused at the beginning with all of the character names that I kept rereading the first 50 pages.  After I let go of that and just started reading, they all came together anyway and the pages started flying!  I could not put it down.  I look forward to the next 2 which I am told are even better!  Must read!
B007HGPBRC|3.0|I have always respected Christophe Hitchens' intellectual honesty and his keen insight into the human condition.  It takes great courage to write about your life when you are facing terminal cancer, and I found many of his thoughts to be  helpful.  He looks death squarely in the eye and does not attempt to hide his feelings in platitudes or religious escapism.  His courage in facing death is laudable, but the decline he experiences and documents is sad and somewhat depressing to me.  It is still hard to lose a great person.

0321714113|4.0|The C++ programming language is big, powerful and painful to master. But it's a wonderful language, both for industrial and academic use. The \\"C++ Primer, 5th Edition\\" is exactly the same. It is a big book, with a lot of information which is not always easily presented. But it's a good book and it appeals to a lot of programmers.<br /><br />The \\"C++ Primer, 5th Edition\\" is not a book for those who just started programming. It is for those people that know the basics of programming and wish to learn how to program C++ the way it's supposed to be. The language is presented in depth, along with all the new features that come with its latest ISO standard, C++11.<br /><br />Object Oriented Programming principles and practice, Generic Programming, Containers, dynamic memory and advanced type support are also all there. Everything is presented in a clear way with a lot of examples and several exercises to get you started.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />1) The summary of \\"Defined Terms\\" at the end of each chapter is a very handful guide on what was presented in the chapter and it greatly assists in both remembering what the chapter was about and as a quick reference.<br /><br />2) The book builds slowly on each concept; object oriented programming and generic programming are reintroduced multiple times in different depths.<br /><br />What I did not like:<br /><br />1) No mention of threads, atomic instructions, memory model or anything remotely close to any of those. This was one of the biggest additions in C++, at the very least an honorary mention should have existed.<br /><br />2) Template metaprogramming is only mentioned once. Yes, it is a difficult subject that few people pursue and even fewer master. But it is an integral part of C++ that will become more and more common in the future. It requires at least its own paragraph or appendix to very briefly explain what it is and where to find additional information.<br /><br />3) The Boost C++ libraries have driven up to a point a lot of the C++11 features. It is a collection of high quality, experimental C++ libraries that is developed by an active community of C++ enthusiasts. Those same people participate in C++ standardization committees that defined the ISO C++11 standard and will produce the next standards. A simple reference, maybe in the same spot as template metaprogramming, would definitely make a useful addition.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the book. Would I recommend it to a new programmer? No. But it is surely on the top of my list for programmers that want to succumb to the call of the C++ Programming Language.p to a point a lot of the C++11 features.

B0001WGDXA|4.0|Here is great music-making that runs the risk of colliding with a sharp change of taste. I can't think of anyone today who would dare to perform the Brahms symphonies with such heart-on-sleeve romanticism. For many listeners Bernstein's cycle from Vienna will seem overwrought. There's a basis for that reaction. At this period in his career he tried to wring emotion from every bar of music; when he succeeded, audiences at his concerts felt that he came closest of any living conductor to recreating music as if it was being composed before their very eyes.<br /><br />But this intense involvement works less well on records, in part because we attend concerts with more sense of occasion than when listening at home. These CDs can sound overcooked, and some tempi are undoubtedly slow. In the Fourth Sym., for example, Bernstein is slower in every movement than any of my versions by Klempeerer, Karajan, Carlos Kleiber, and Furtwangler. I don't own Brahms done by Celibidache or Knappertsbusch, two committed slow pokes, but Bernstein is in their vicinity. This breadth allows us to revel in the glorious sonority of the Vienna Phil. At the same time, the conductor has space to bring out expressive points, as Bernstein does constantly. Which isn't to say that the lyric line isn't allowed to flow; the mood is often surprisingly inward and reflective, while at other times, as in the first movement of Sym. no. 1, there is a wrenching effort to dig into the bowels of the earth, as it were.<br /><br />If you already connect with such an intensely personal style, Bernstein's Brahms cycle will appeal to you. There is no other conductor outside of Furtwangler who approaches these scores with such a heated emotional charge or who brings out so much struggle and suffering. But if your ideal is Mackerras, Szell, or Harnoncourt, all Brahmsians of a cooler breed, this cycle might be unduly emotional and intense. I predict that it will grow in stature as Bernstein's public persona recedes and the interpretations speak for themselves, and for a lost romantic tradition.the interpretations speak for themselves, and for a lost romantic tradition.
B0053KWDES|2.0|Forgive me if I am being picky but when you buy a gizmo to improve the sound of your music player you expect that it will perform like a champ, sorry Fiio this amp is just ok nothing to brag about, and what really drive me crazy is a constant hiss at low volume. Consider that you are using headphones and by default you are maximizing your sound quality to be able to hear things closer and with much higher definition and detail. Well in the piano passages that background hiss really kills the music enjoyment.<br />For all Iphone users I found an app ($2.99) made by BBE pro that really can help you fine tune the sound in a more melodic way some how reconstructing part of the sound lost by the compression of the recording and bringing it to a warmer tone, more punchy and vibrant and the best of all is that the app will let you fine tune the output just the way you want it, now that is a better solution instead of buying a amp.
B005VR9328|3.0|As a longtime, dedicated Roots fan I've noticed a pattern lately; release one near perfect LP, then release a haphazard, slightly lackluster effort as a followup. \\"Undun\\" belongs in the latter catergory. After the stellar one two punch of \\"How I Got Over\\" & \\"Wake Up\\" in 2010, this comes as a bit of a letdown. My major problem with this LP is that it doesn't quite cohere,the individual tracks are okay but don't sound like they're meant to share album space. This is not a 'concept' album its a collection of singles strung together with little thought given to flow, continuity or narrative structure. There are some fine moments scattered throughout but on the whole, this is underwhelming. Black Thought was once the best emcee in the game but here, he sounds workmanlike and downright bored on some of these warmed-over tracks....where's the fire?<br />I'm also a fan of brevity and keeping things short and sweet but for a short LP, this seems bereft of any real ideas, the last 3 or 4 tracks could have been left off completely and not been missed. Perhaps this should have been released as an EP? I will continue to support the band but gentlemen, its time to rediscover and follow your muse and cease with the half-hearted, filler laden product disguised as 'art', your true fans deserve better.
B007SGM084|3.0|If I had bought only the first book I would never have bought the other two. The story in general reminds me of a Barbara Cartland novel - innocent, virgin, average young woman meets wealthy, handsome man with some dark secret who initiates her in love and sex. Add some (very light, honestly) BSDM action and that's pretty much what the series is about. Both main characters are too extreme to be believable - Christian is just TOO rich, beautiful and sexy; Ana is too clumsy, inexperienced and sometimes downright stupid. The number of sex scenes is ridiculous and I started skipping them after the 5th or so. That said, and considering I bought the 3 book bundle, I read the trilogy really fast and was interested in knowing how it would end; the ending didn't disappoint but was very predictable. I think it is an easy read for someone who is not expecting depth and just wants to have some fun.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I thoroughly enjoy this game.  It has fun challenges and does not have too much pressure to buy stuff from the store with real money like a lot of games these days.
B000SEFNMS|4.0|I could not put this book down.  This story was well written and helped you understand Chris McCandles mind set and the reasons why he lived his life like he did.  Being a mother I can't imagine the pain I would feel to lose a son in such a way, especially having been estranged for so many years prior.
0307949508|5.0|This is another installment in Larsson's Millennium trilogy, and I must say that it might be the best of the bunch. It is smart and exciting, but also includes a more realistic portrayal of the emotions of those included within the story. IT moves very fast and is never slow at all. I would suggest it to anyone that is wanting to read something that meets all these requirements. Also, you can keep up with some favorite characters if you bought into the trilogy as well. Get it and enjoy!

You will love the twists and turns on this season 2.
0307341577|5.0|First time reading a book by author. Title was very appropriate. It was a very dark novel and probably not for everyone. Characters while not particularly likeable were very well developed. It was a real page turner with a slam bam ending.  Am currently looking forward to reading her current best seller \\"Gone Girl\\"
B0095R76EW|2.0|This was an \\"ok\\" movie in my opinion.  It basically shows the best scenes in the preview.  It drags out and the ending is pretty obvious.  But, it's good for a low key night as long as the expectations are low.  That's my two cents!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|fun and an addictive game. I have played this game on my Pc. So glad I downloaded the free app for my Kindle Fire.
B005S9ELM6|5.0|There's not one dull moment in Argo, from the opening scene of a mob taking over the US Embassy, to the final white-knuckled trip to the airport. What a story!  It's so well and deftly told, the viewer is not conscious of the passage of two hours.<br /><br />The entire cast is excellent, portraying the nuances of terror, the single-minded fanaticism of the Ayatollah Khomeini's henchmen and the mind-numbing US bureaucracy (\\"So is this the best bad idea you've come up with?\\")with equal conviction.  Alan Arkin and John Goodman are splendid as the cynical Hollywood team behind the Argo caper and provide some much needed comic relief (\\"\\"Ar, go f*** yourself\\" is a running gag).<br /><br />I don't know who the actor is, and am too lazy to look it up, but the Iranian security officer who questions Mendez et al at the airport is absolutely brilliant.  Well, everybody is, and so is the entire movie.  During the closing credits, when actual photographs from the hostage incident are shown alongside corresponding stills from the movie, and the actual State Department IDs are shown with the actor playing that role, it's astonishing how accurately the movie mirrors reality.<br /><br />And yes, Canadians are the nicest people on the planet.<br /><br />For suspense, a step back to the 1970s, an heroic story, and a shining example of how for once, the US got something right, Argo is perfection. If this movie doesn't walk away with every Academy Award it's eligible for, there's something wrong.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Even though this is JUST a soap opera, I am in genuine love with Downton Abbey.  I think Season #1 got even better, and more over the top, with even the old trope of someone (sort of) coming back from the dead!  (Sorry, guess I should have given a spolier alert...haha.)  Anyway, the cast is an absolute dream, which their multiple Emmy nominations and wins prove.  You have to give it an episode or two to let it get under your skin!

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is the thinking person's soap opera, for sure.  What I love about Downton Abbey is that it's complete mind candy, and yet because it's on PBS you manage to never feel bad about watching because you convince yourself you're doing something good for your brain.  This is the best show on tv.
B004LP3AYI|2.0|This is an excellent book. It is very well written and the story pulls you in. The only trouble with this book is that there are an overwhelming number of typos. Every single instance of 'than' is replaced with 'that'. Incorrect usage of a/an is common and extra or missing words are on almost every single page. It is incredibly jarring to be reading and encounter a few (1-5) typos per book. This is unacceptable. The only reason I gave two stars was because it is otherwise very well written.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Solid match 3 puzzle game with an mythology twist.  Excellent sound, beautiful visuals, and responsive controls. Definately worth the money and even better for free.
B000SEH80I|5.0|This is an awesome book. My wife and I had been in marriage counseling with a PhD for a year when this book was recommended to us with the caveat of \\"It may not all apply, but see if some of it fits.\\" We arrived at this point after doing sort of the standard marriage counseling stuff and trying many different things in therapy when the counselor started noticing things about my wife's childhood and the way she was raised that he suspected may have contributed to an inhibited sexuality and inability to prioritize the needs of her own family in relation to the family that raised her. There were also issues with her parents' inability to relate to her (and the other adult siblings in her family) as an adult and parent which were causing significant problems in our marriage.<br /><br />I thought some of this was 'normal' and I was just being a jerky husband at times for not wanting to be around her family a lot and wanting to focus on her and my son apart from my in-laws, but I was really struggling. At times I'd feel very confident that the relationship governance I was seeking would be beneficial for us as a family and at other times I'd feel like a jerk for telling my wife exactly what I thought about how her family acted. I didn't feel like I had any kind of example to point to about how to manage the situation. I had trouble putting a lot of my emotions about it into words without it being a contention point in our marriage. This book spoke volumes to me in the first few chapters and really validated some things I was feeling and struggling with as a husband, a father and a man. I found myself highlighting sections that sounded almost like direct quotes from my in-laws. I couldn't put the book down because I felt like this author had been watching videos of the dysfunction in our extended family events for some time.<br /><br />My wife has been reading it and has already put some tools from it to good use. I finally feel like our marriage is getting the air it needed to survive.<br /><br />This book was probably the best thing that happened to our marriage and I was able to use the tools in it to help my wife navigate some very sticky family drama recently. She was also able to put the approaches in the book to good use in order to help out her sister who has been struggling and has been in therapy for a few years.

B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I was skeptical about the new Hawaaii Five-0 when I first heard about the new show (since my parents are huge fans of the original and own the DVD's for each season), but I am SO glad I tuned in and gave this series a chance! I love the relationship between the four main cast members, especially the banter between Alex O'Loughlin and Scott Caan. (Some of their \\"carguments\\", as they have come to be called, are classic!) It's been fun to see the rebirth of the show and a lot of the original characters from Five-O. But this is the 21st Century Hawaii Five-0, so don't expect it to be a replica of the original. The new Steve McGarrett is much more hands on than the McGarrett made famous by Jack Lord -- mostly thanks to hunky Aussie Alex O'Loughlin and his Navy Seal persona. Scott Caan brings a fresh face to the character of Danny \\"Danno\\" Williams, who is much more outspoken than the original and willing to disagree with the Boss (O'Loughlin). Daniel Dae Kim as Chin Ho and Grace Park as Kono fit perfectly into their roles as well. And I especially love any scence graced by Taylor Wiley as Kamekona! Hawaii Five-0 is packed with fast-paced storylines, plenty of action, beautiful scenery and a fun glimpse into the personal lives of the four stars. (It was mentioned on one of the DVD extras that the only thing that may have really been missing from the original was a real peek into the personal lives of the cast, and I completely agree. I love seeing these four great characters away from Five-0.) IMHO this is one of the best shows on television! Give it a chance on its own merits and you won't be disappointed.

B000UX6THK|5.0|When Twin Peaks aired on television, none could have predicted how the murder of Laura Palmer would move not only the town's citizens, who knew Laura as a generous and good-hearted teenager, but also millions of viewers. Indeed, over thirty episodes, they would discover a community of five thousand citizens who hide, behind closed doors and curtains, dangerous secrets. With the investigation done by the FBI agent Dale Cooper and the Twin Peaks sheriff Harry Truman, they uncover those same secrets and try to answer the one-million dollar question.<br /><br />Who killed Laura Palmer?<br /><br />Though the main characters are Agent Dale and Sheriff Truman, Twin Peaks is an ensemble show since each episode narrates a complete day, which includes the lives of Twin Peaks residents, and the Laura Palmer investigation. For each episode, we witness characters' pains and joys of their lives, but we slowly find out that Laura herself was not who she was and that dangerous forces haunt the woods of Twin Peaks. Not only that, we also witness an awesome romance between Audrey Horne and Special Agent Dale Cooper, which gave to its actress Sherilyn Fenn the success she deserved.<br /><br />As such, the show itself can switch emotions very quickly, going from drama to comedy, then towards pure terror. As such, the show is not your usual drama-investigation-soap opera. Even the music that Angelo Badalamenti did completely differs to what was done in the eighties and today. It haunts your heart as tunes like Falling, Audrey's Dance, Laura's Theme, and the Woods' Theme play in the background.<br /><br />Though my favorite characters were Dale Cooper, Audrey Horne, Andy, Lucy, Shelly, the Log Lady, and the whole Palmer family, I have to admit that the most unforgettable remains BOB, played by the excellent Frank Silva, set dresser for the pilot and a David Lynch collaborator whose scenes in the show have spooked me for days. Especially the short ones he did in certain episodes.<br /><br />About the other special Features, I appreciated everything this DVD set offers, although I wish they could have shown the funny Sesame Street parody of Twin Peaks.<br /><br />As a final note, to everybody interested in Twin Peaks, it is important to know that the show's broadcaster, ABC, horribly mistreated the series. As explained in the making of, ABC was uncomfortable with the show narration and shocking content, especially coming from the director who did Blue Velvet, movie that shocked the public and industry with its sexual and sadomasochistic scenes. But what really unsettled the ABC bosses was the sudden popularity of a show that they had no hope in the first place. So they forced the creators to reveal the murderer's identity in the middle of the second season, which they unfortunately did. This was a foolish idea since it hurt the story's plot device and forced the creators to come up with less-spectacular storylines. As such, the Laura Palmer story goes for seventeen episodes (pilot included) and remains the best of what is in Twin Peaks. Of the last thirteen episodes, they feel to me like a jumble of good ideas that don't hit their full potential. Of course, the Windom Earle events are great, but what happens with Little Nicky, James and Irene, and the Pine Weasel doesn't strike the same chord as Laura Palmer's story. And with what happens with the Audrey Horne/Cooper romance, I prefer to stick with the first seventeen episodes who make a complete series by themselves. Speaking of that Audrey Horne/Cooper romance, Kyle MacLachlan explains in the making-of why he asked the storyline to be dropped. However, I tend to believe more the explanations Mark Frost, Bob Engels and Sherilyn Fenn said, especially after seeing on YouTube interviews with Sherilyn Fenn, and the \\"2011 Twin Peaks Convention Q&A Dinner Meeting\\", where Sheryl Lee and Lenny Von Dohlen talked about a certain cast member I will not name, but whom they found unpleasant. And to me, I think stopping that plotline due to some behind-the-scenes conflict hurt the show as much as the revelation of Laura Palmer's mystery. Especially since that romance was supposed to be the next major plot line of the second season.<br /><br />So why the Five stars even though I think the last thirteen episodes are not up to par with the first seventeen episodes. Because the setting and universe this series presents remains unique and light-years to what is done on television. It also offered the chance for shows to tell their stories like movies instead of the usual talk-talk in television, and Twin Peaks, even years after its unfair cancellation, still remains in the collective mind of the public, of its fans, and of the industry. Indeed, shows like The X-Files, Lost, Desperate Housewives, Once Upon a Time, Riget, the Killing, movies like The Blair Witch Project, and video games like Alan Wake, Max Payne, and Deadly Premonition owe a lot to Twin Peaks. If there is one thing that makes them different from Twin Peaks, it is that they never repeated the same mistake that Twin Peaks did.<br /><br />God knows what would have happened if the show had been done either in syndication, or on cable channels like HBO who started to bring out excellent series like Tales from the Crypt. Maybe Twin Peaks would have had its third, and probably final season, done.topping that plotline due to some behind-the-scenes conflict hurt the show as much as the revelation of Laura Palmer's mystery.

B003PIS5XI|5.0|i WATCHED THIS MOVIE MANY YEARS AGO AND I THOUGHT SOME OF MY GRANDCHILDREN WOULD LIKE IT, I WAS RIGHT..THEY LOVED IT.
B008BIN9EW|2.0|The game is focused almost exclusively geared to online gaming, and the online gaming (if lucky) will have lag.  I would prefer more solo play options.<br /><br />The game play itself is fair, warranting a 3 or 4 star level (for the cost of the game).
B007THA4FI|2.0|J.K., what were you thinking?  A mundane book with unforgettable boring characters in a trite story.  That her characters are unforgettable is usually a good thing however, this book was so trite and depressing I wish I could forget the characters...unfortunately they stay with you long after the story is over and not in a good way.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My very young grandchildren like the bright colors and birds. A great game for those rainey, dreary days or those Dog Days of Summer in Texas. Excellant for hand to eye coordination. The giggles and belly laughs are priceless! Thanks for offering the Angry Birds game for free Cheryl
0525953728|5.0|A outstanding book.All should read so you know first hand what our military does and the hardships they go though....
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|unless you want to spend money on coins you will find yourself walking away from the game and coming back to it.  addictive
B0088X7YMS|5.0|Considering this is the fourth entry in the series, it was done really well. the CGI was crisp and elaborate. a pretty decent and unique story. soundtrack is great, featuring some of the music from the original score. this entry is definitely a good gateway to future sequels. the return of the 3 main characters from the first movie is truly a welcome surprise. all other new characters really have personality as well. a good movie, and I highly recommend it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't wait to finish this book! The author is indeed an excellent writer that keeps the reader engaged, invested in the characters, and on the edge of your seat. I cared about them all!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Definitely a page turner . couldn't wait to read book three. this series is a must have. looking forward to her next books!
B005K17RU0|5.0|works great.  I have had no troubles with it even while traveling across the U.S. If I had a connection I got the Local weather just fine.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|A nice chill game to pass the time with. No complaints thus far. Has a lot of levels. I recommend it definitely.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I saw this on you tube and have ordered 2 from Amazon for gifts.  Amazing performance and the gifts were a hit.  It would only be better if I were there.
B007SGM084|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book! i couldn‘t put it down once i started, i would read it again in a heartbeat.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|fun game for short games or longer ones.  well worth the few dollars I paid for it.  always trying to better the last score.
B009FZZFME|5.0|Waiting 24 hours for the season premiere stinks...How disappointing!!!!!!!!!! I agree with all the other fans who have been sent here by Dish... Now I just hope the straming works well in HD without glitches...I may cancel Dish soon as well....and what about next season???????<br /><br />UPDATE:  Ok. so it took me awhile to get it...thanks for all the comments...To clarify...Walking Dead is the best TV show out there...DISH, I apologize...thanks for the ROKU player and for fixing the AMC thing quickly...mea culpa...
B008G8SFGO|5.0|You will not be disappointed.  If you are a hardcore KISS fan (like myself) don't try to compare this album to previous recordings, appreciate it for what it is.  Enjoy!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I was wondering why a match-3 game would have such glowing reviews until I actually played it. I am thoroughly impressed by the quality of this game. To be honest, I can't think of a single thing against this game, though I do wonder what will happen once I complete the campaign (will there be any reason to continue playing after that?). The graphics are outstanding and the sound is quite exceptional. I normally play all games with my tablet muted just out of sheer habit. I happened to leave the sound on during this game and I am quite glad that I did so. I especially like the voice-overs in between levels and find them quite interesting. Much to my surprise, the background music did not wear on me at all, even after several hours of play.<br /><br />A definite plus to this game is multiple profile support. Finally, I can show my friend a game without him having to continue from where I left off. He can create his own profile that doesn't interfere with mine at all. I wish more games were like this.<br /><br />The one point that I am not quite sure on is the price point. Is this game worth $5? I'm not sure yet. It is difficult to compare this with other similar games because it is exceedingly rare to find a game of this quality. Without playing through the entirety of the game, I can definitely say it worth at least $3. Ultimately, I'm guessing that its worth will depend on replay value. For $5, I want something more than entertainment for a day. I will update this review when I finish the game and can determine replay value from there, but, for now, I have some homework that needs doing. ;)
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|smooth and well polished. the graphics are nice and the game runs with no errors or glitches.  the story and the challenges ,in addition, help to make this one of the best faotd so far.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|There were times when I almost stopped reading but then the next paragraph would suck me back in. Now I am off to read the second one.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Take a failing franchise, rife with amazing backstory, and fan enthusiasm. Put it in a pot and take a huge dump on it.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I really enjoyed it couldn't keep my hands off it.  which it had more games .  My daughter loved it also.  Need more games and more birds .
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game. it took a little while for me to figure out the fishing but I finally got it.
B005HCI72O|3.0|Still enjoying the yarns, but not as gripping as the earlier novels in the series. Jamie has become a predicatable cutout; the female characters less so, the history still interesting. Hey - but I read it all and bought the next one!
B00005K9QP|5.0|This is one of the better Blues Rock efforts of all time going all the way back to 1966. The album pretty much launched Eric Clapton to God status and on to his next project Cream.<br /><br />&#34;Backed by a solid rhythm section that included future Fleetwood Mac namesake John McVie on bass and drummer Hughie Flint (who would go on to form McGuinness Flint with former Manfred Mann guitarist Tom McGuinness), Clapton had the necessary support to let his imagination fly. Mayall was a strict bandleader, demanding a lot from his players but here he lets Clapton become the superstar he had the potential to be.&#34;<br /><br />Clapton's innovative style combined with Mayall's voice, piano and harp made this an instant classic.<br /><br />The Bluesbreakers on the other hand did well but unfairly didn't climb to the top rung of the ladder like Clapton did. Mayall definitely has reached God status in his own way and that was by churning out cream of the crop blues for the last 50+ years, not too shabby. Mayall is nearing 80 years old and still going strong.<br /><br />All of the songs are great, not a weak one in the bunch. Solid lyrics, great instrumentals and the first true guitarist album of all time. Clapton took this one and has been riding it ever since in all its glory. A true classic.
034580404X|5.0|You will NOT be able to put this book down!! it is an AWESOME trilogy!! Trust me...it is NOT written  by a 5th grader as some of the reviews states!! I really hope you take my advice and read this book...if i could give it more than 5 stars..i most definately would11 very addictive and hard to put down. Yes some of the reviews posted say its nothing but porno on paper... but is really nothing like that...many couples who need to rekindle that spark in your marriae...this is the boook to help!! i will say though that this trilogy is NOT a TWEEN book!! i hope my review helps you and that you enjoy it!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a strong ending for a fantastic series.<br />I admit the ending was a hard one to read but when does war ever have a very happy ending?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not a reader but everyone said, you have to read this book. I broke down and read it and couldn't believe how disappointed I was when I had finished the it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This author is fantastic!  I would say that this book is by far my favorite in the series. Peeta Mellark is so adorable and strong!!! Don't want to spoil it.<br />A must read! like right now!!!!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I normally don't write amazon reviews, but Hugh Howey claims to read every single one, so I thought, why not?<br /><br />First off, do yourself a favor and buy the Wool Omnibus, because you'll be hooked!  A unique take on the popular dystopian theme, the characters are well developed.  I found this to be a modern Brave New World by Aldous Huxley.  I don't mean that Wool is a retelling of Brave New World, but (just an example)where as the population of BNW is obviously and purposefully divided into hierarchical social caste system, Wool allows the readers to pick up the subtle societal details on their own.<br /><br />Wool is  a solid read in the fact that characters and setting well described, it has an interesting concept, and I didn't find it the twists predictable.<br /><br />I can't wait for the series to continue :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great read.  I only read the book after watching the movie so there were a few spoilers but I was still surprised at how much emotion the book could still invoke.<br /><br />I'm glad I read the book instead of just relying on the movie, the book is FAR better than the movie!  Read the whole series!!!
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|You need to read this book; it will take very little of your time.<br /><br />It explains why you beat yourself up and can help you to stop. It can help you to like yourself.<br /><br />This book can help you find peace of mind.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Jack Reacher once again proves he is the man<br />Nice twist in this one and some of the action in the end of the book catches you off guard<br />A good read
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game its like a version of super Mario brothers. I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!! its so fun n I play this game all the time
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Rented this on amazon and was happy for a) a 48-hour rental and b) a quality movie.  Even if you're not a Marvel fan, there's some good stuff on here.  Loved some of the Hulk's humorous scenes (Hulk and Thor was hilarious!).
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|This movie should be seen by everyone, made me feel so ashamed that our coloured people were actually treated like this for a very long time. great characters and it stays in your memory long after the end. definately not to be missed
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|I watched this movie a couple of months ago and I fell in love with it. First, I have always been a fan of Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey. I believe the movie has a great casting, great settings, plot and a wonderful message, We are not alone in this world!! Althought this movie is about finding life in the outerspace, it doesn't involved aliens, machine wars or any overrated science fiction. The movie as simple as it may seem is actually Awesome.
B007TK77QE|5.0|This book holds your attention all the way through, although with so many characters i did sometimes get confused as to who was whom sometimes, but very good reading
B0098VYCCE|4.0|This was a great movie,Charlize Theron as the witch stepmother was just down right frighting. She deserves every award she wins for her acting skills, I fear for anyone with a stepmother like her. I hate the way the movie ended though, maybe they left it wide open like that to make room for the sequel. From the rumors they are not going to use Kristen Stewart, that would be a shame because I would like to see the battle between the Huntsman and William for Snow's heart.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Thank You. Fast service and excellent copy. The movie was in great condition. Me and my family enjoy watching the movie especially since we all loved the books. :)
000746603X|4.0|I had been looking forward to reading this book since it was first announced. It's entertaining, but also strangely disappointing in terms of not living up to high expectations - those expectations having been raised simply by the highly intelligent and articulate nature of the author. The tone of the text is rather academic and sedate and it rather lacks the passion and wit that has typically been present in the author's interviews, articles and letters. It is as if it is the product of a therapist coaxing the facts of a story out of a patient for a clinical document. Much of the story has been documented elsewhere in detail, drawing upon interviews and texts, but there are a number of personal insights and revelations that do expand upon it. I do think that the book suffers from being too condensed and edited. Many key milestones in the author's career and development flash by in only a few lines when they warrant far more detail and exploration. In fact, the book could well have been twice the length and split into two volumes to do its subject greater justice. The style of the narrative is to a degree confessional in its accounts of the largely self-destructive lifestyle that the author has frequently led and of the strain that he subjected his wife, family and friends too. However, the emphasis is on documenting that lifestyle and not really clarifying or exploring the motivation or reasons for it. The portrait the author paints of himself is at times quite uncomfortable. Whilst his audience eagerly awaited his and The Who's recordings and performances, the flipside of producing and maintaining those triumphs seems to have taken a very heavy toll on his relationships with those closest to him and the question that is left hanging is really one of whether the artistic and commercial successes have truly been worth the cost of the damage that he has inflicted on himself and others. Given the author's tendency to recycle and revisit his work, I hope that this workwill one day be revisited and expanded in such a way as to give more of an insight into what makes him tick and what motivated him to do his best work. Until then this is the book to read.
B00136RYXG|5.0|I like the song, the group, and the album. I don't know what else to say. I really like the album.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I just wish you earned more coins at a faster rate. Coins and very expensive to purchase. I would like this game better if it had more coins.
B005721Y7Y|5.0|WARNING SPOILERS! This is an excellent movie, arguably one of the best movies ever. I recommend it to anyone.  The characters are interesting, dimensional and not boring. There's moments of comedy, romance and action, as well as excellent twists and turns in the plot. The character of Lester is brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey. In fact, all of the characters are well acted.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is such a great read!  I could not wait to see how the story would end and Suzanne Collins did not disappoint.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the series.
B000I186FW|5.0|WARNING SPOILERS! This is an excellent movie, arguably one of the best movies ever. V is a intriguing, influential mastermind. The movie itself is the same way. I recommend it to anyone. There's moments of comedy, romance and action, as well as excellent twists and turns in the plot.

B004YM6JI2|5.0|I noticed alot of people complained about this season and was surprised!  I thought this season was very good, it was packed with action but still had the drama with the brothers, and the cliffhanger at the end of the season really surprised me.  I would have liked to see more of Castiel but hopefully he will appeear more in Season 8, cant wait!!
B001H1SVO8|5.0|WARNING SPOILERS! This is an excellent movie, arguably one of the best movies ever. There's moments of comedy, romance and action, as well as excellent twists and turns in the plot. The movie itself is very influential and the film itself is quite visually stunning. I recommend it to anyone.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|a good amount of hack and slash plus there are goals to be met for decent reward. love it very much
B002MGGM9I|5.0|WARNING SPOILERS! This is an excellent movie, arguably one of the best movies ever. There's moments of comedy, romance and action, as well as excellent twists and turns in the plot. The relationship between Donnie and Gretchen is cute but it also keeps tension. I recommend it to anyone.  The characters are interesting, dimensional and not boring.
B000W91RUG|5.0|\\"The Big Bang Theory\\" is the funniest show I've ever seen!  What else can I say?  I laugh so hard I end up crying.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat. I didn't know what to expect next. Very interesting & entertaining.  Also, an unexpected ending
B004SDSSFY|4.0|I didn't INTENTIONALLY download this application, however, I was charged, so I am keeping the program.  I was disappointed I was not able to transfer the license from my Blackberry over to this application, but dem da brakes!  The program works as just like my desktop so to me it's seamless.  Good product!
B008XBCJ34|1.0|Thanks to their exclusive deal with 1 hardware company i couldn't buy this when i cared most about the film. I bought the extended blu ray and<br />won't be springing for it again.<br />It's just not that good.
B00932A2MC|4.0|Watches this mooe with me 9 and 11 year old little brothers. Was actually pretty good and entertaining. I liked it very much, but it's more of a rental than a purchase if you ask me
B007IXWKUK|5.0|All three of the books were wonderful, I liked the last one the least I hope E James writes more
B005KR6OBM|3.0|I dont know how to review this product. I LOVE big bang theory, but for the price they sell it here on amazon, its an insane rip off. I wanted to buy the complete season here but its not worth it! Google it, you can find much better deals.<br /><br />But talking about the product itself, its great. I love the plot line of Big Bang Theory, and throughout the seasons, I have really grown a connection with each character. The show is very witty, nerdy, however humorous and cute. There are not many sexually jokes compared to a sitcom say New Girl, but throughout the seasons it progresses. I love the amount of comic book jokes, nerd problems, for example... nerds not getting a chance with girls.<br /><br />This show is definitely for the little more intelligent, even I dont understand all the jokes they make and I'm a freshmen in college. Hopefully as the seasons continue and I grow wiser in science, I will understand more, laugh more, and fall in love with the characters even more. This show really is an amazing one, one to definitely give a shot.
B007YH3DV0|5.0|Exactly as I expected, Brand New Hunger Games paperback set.<br /><br />Great book series really hard to put down.<br /><br />Brand New, Nearly perfect condition and arrived several days early.<br /><br />No Cons that I can think of.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Don't subscribe to your reviews, people can't help but show their ass on the internet.<br /><br />I loved this book. You didn't? Too bad, so sad. Go troll somewhere else.
B008OJ291W|5.0|First up, the songs on here are 5 star, that's why my review is 5 star.<br />The songs here, however, are not improvements on their originals - would that make the originals 6 star? maybe<br /><br />When you replace orchestra (WHAT YOU\\"RE KNOWN FOR) with synths it doesn't improve a thing. Maybe Jeff should have called this project Electric Light Syntheziser.<br /><br />I get what he's doing. He's funding his retirement.<br />I don't dislike re-recordings provided they don't replace originals. Really you get the bonus of being able to listen to the original whenever you want and also have the option of the new stuff. I'm all for it<br /><br />I don't think the songs here are updated for today though. They are straight re-recordings of the old material. What's lacking here is 30-40 years of touring experience and growth in the songs. Other bands that have toured constantly would bring a live sound into re-records, taking the evolved song and putting it on tape for a new feel. These songs haven't changed. This album should have been one of reworkings, not re-recordings.<br /><br />No song here sounds better or even on par with it's original.<br />Mr Blue Sky is pretty good though. Nice and bouncey and perhaps the highlight<br />Evil Woman sounds OK. Pretty close in sound to the original<br />Strange Magic is pretty close in sound to the original also<br />Don't Bring Me Down (original)is my all time fave ELO song and here it just loses something. It needed to be rocked up. The Don't Bring Me Down - Grossss! just doesn't cut it here.<br />Turn To Stone again, is pretty close to the original. No surprises here. My wife's fave ELO track<br />Showdown was never a favorite for me. Sounds pretty good here. Again, close to the original<br />Telephone Line is a bit of a let down. The song have lost its heart. The chorus is so uninspired now. Sad.<br />Livin' Thing was always top 3 fave (the other Calling America)is a bit of let down. The chorus has lost most of it's feeling.<br />Do Ya, sure I've always liked it but I think Jeff rates it a bit too highly. The version here is no improvment.<br />Can't Get It Out Of My Head is perhaps the biggest let down here. It's lost its soul and gained a heap of synth. I'm glad I fell in love with the original before hearing this one. I don't even really like listening to this one as it makes me sad and not in a good way. Listen to the Jeff and Richard Tandy version on youtube. Sooooo much better and has some feeling to it.<br />10538 Overture is perhaps the only song that has a better 'sound' but it still isn't a supieror recording. The 'sound' of the oiginal was part of it's charm.<br />Point Of No Return is very mid 80's ELO sounding. I'm not sure where this one comes from but it's a nice enough track.<br /><br />Opportunity missed here I think. Each song should have been refreshed, redone, not just re-recorded karaoke style.

B0088WGBC8|4.0|This is an action packed thriller about a rogue spy very much in the Bourne tradition.  If you liked the Bourne movies you'll like this one too.  The plot is pretty straight forward and does not have many surprises but the action sequences are what make it worth watching. Enjoy!
1616960922|5.0|Excellent and novel (the adjective, not the noun), but overpriced for a paperback novella (~170 pages, and in relatively large type).

B0071XO8RA|3.0|Interesting enough to read, however did not live up to my expectations.  The reviews I read were so good on this that it made me excited, however was let down by a lack of action and adventure.  I just finished reading the hunger games series and was expecting Wool omnibus to be better, but it's not.  There are several parts that are slow and dull.  It's worth reading, but not better written than the hunger games.

She shares a more mellow content in this album with her audience while still maintaining her aggressive \\"I will be heard!\\" attitude.

B0053JJLLC|5.0|I'm a fan of Crichton and was not sure what to think of this book since it was finished by another author.  There are a lot of writers out there (think James Patterson) who have created what should be called book factories that crank out novels written by others that don't hold a candle to the original author's work.  However, this is the real deal: it is a real book that Crichton couldn't finish that was completed by an author who tried to do it justice.  I don't think it is the best thing that Crichton ever wrote, but is certainly better than some of his weaker works.  Actually, it was quite a page turner and I enjoyed it immensely.
B009AJDDQU|4.0|Well, with almost 650 very mixed reviews already on Amazon for Prometheus, there is more than a fair share to help you determine whether or not you should be viewing this via Instant Video, renting or purchasing the DVD. I opted for Instant Video and I think that the movie is so good that I should have purchased it to put in my Blu Ray collection next to my [[ASIN:B0000VCZK2 Alien Quadrilogy]].<br /><br />Prometheus is a must for fans of the Alien franchise. It takes a more philosophical turn than the action-heavy Alien movies, but that's what makes it uniquely great. And don't get me wrong...there is ultimately plenty of action. It's just that Director Ridley Scott and his writing team decided to throw in the \\"all important\\" controversial questions: Evolution created Man? God created Man? Both??? Prometheus takes a ride down this slippery slope that is sure to get the ire up more from the pro-religion crowd than the scientific crowd.<br /><br />I'd be surprised if there's anyone here that already isn't aware of the movie's premise, but basically here's what you get: Some scientists/geologists/archeologists discover a clue on Earth to the beginnings of mankind that takes them to a planet/moon that will be familiar to Alien fans. There, they hope to have \\"the all important question\\" answered. And you know--by at minimum watching the trailers--that the crew get a lot more than they bargained for than just answered questions.<br /><br />The acting is awesome and the special effects are top notch. I was glued to my seat. I felt that the movie moved at a quick pace, and I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of the just over 2-hour flick.<br /><br />Is the movie flawless?...Heck, no. And if you've already seen the movie and you have not read the 1-star review on the front of the Prometheus product page here at Amazon called \\"Take the Scientist's Survival Pop Quiz v2.0!\\" on September 23, 2012 by Arthur J Bullock Jr, it is worth the short, accurate and amusing recap of the movie's major holes. If you've not seen the movie, I'd stay away from Mr. Bullock's review due to the spoilers involved.<br /><br />My take is that Prometheus fits in as an outstanding, unexpected, unique and unpredictable prequel to some of my favorite movies ever made.major holes. If you've not seen the movie, I'd stay away from Mr. Bullock's review due to the spoilers involved.<br /><br />My take is that Prometheus fits in as an outstanding, unexpected, unique and unpredictable prequel to some of my favorite movies ever made.

0062183591|3.0|\\"The Honest Truth\\" was a disappointment. It seemed to be a take-off on Ariely's awesome \\"Predictably Irrational,\\" the book that introduced me to his simple yet brilliant studies into why humans behave the way they do. In \\"The Honest Truth,\\" Ariely shows (with results from studies and personal experience) endless variations on the theme that we all cheat, but only a little. We cheat and lie more when we feel cheated. We lie and cheat more when are stressed. We cheat and lie more when other people are cheating too. We lie to ourselves when we have an interest in doing so. We cheat less in the presence of supervision or a reminder of proper morals. And on and on.<br /><br />There was one new area of interest. Ariely began with a critique of the SMORC (Simple Model of Rational Crime model of human behavior. This model posits that human beings make rational calculations about whether to cheat, lie or steal. The decision to rob a bank balances the likelihood of riches against the possible punishment for getting caught. But having brought up the prospect for proving or disproving this sensible approach to explain behavior, Ariely for the most part abandons it.<br /><br />With \\"Predictable Irrationality,\\" Ariely hit a mother lode of popular sociology. With \\"The Honest Truth,\\" he has mined that lode dry it. Sadly, I have grown tired of the micro studies that explore every aspect of cheating. I got the general idea and was bored with its endless variations. In only one case (with marital infidelity) did Ariely generalize from his studies to explain puzzling human behavior. This was in marked contract with his previous work, which gave the reader insight into the troubling financial scandals (like Enron) that were rocking then nation.<br /><br />\\"The Honest Truth\\" might be eye-opening for a first-time Ariely reader. But not for those who have read his work before.
B00992CF6W|4.0|If you want a mobile minecraft game, its here its a lot like the xbox version minus a few details. You do not get buckets and canot make most of the things you can. Its also a lot smaller world. The only lava world had to use the seed nayn. All in all its noot the best but for the price it was worth it.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This movie was better than I thought it would be with great action, and good special effects. As far as comic book movies, this must be one of the best. Aside of Batman of course, he's the man!
0425263908|5.0|If you liked Fifty Shades you will defintley love this book.  I have also read the second book Reflections to you.  Both books were great. Can't wait until the third on comes out in December have already pre-ordered.
B00881VLCE|5.0|my 4 year old loves it just as much as I do. great free puzzles. I use constantly in the car for my daughter or for a fun time killer for myself
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|Got these for my daughter's second birthday. She loved them and played with them. We keep buying more pieces for Lego Duplo, but these baby animals really caught her imagination. She is now three and has spent hours with them. She speaks for them, makes jungles for them and has the zookeeper take care of them. They were even part of a jungle rescue scenario involving her Lego Duplo dinosaur.<br /><br />She even uses them to spell out their names - or rather 'they are spelling out their own names'. ;) Next year her fingers will be strong enough for the big kids Lego pieces, but I know these animals are still going to wander around whatever worlds she builds.<br /><br />Given the low price and the high imagination usage, this has been worth every penny - it has added value to her building block world.
B00992CF6W|5.0|worth the money.its a mini version at a mini price.if u don't have any other version the price is perfect.if u have Pc or xbox it is overpriced cause they should give somekind of discount to u guys.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Very good read; Rowling is obviously capable of stringing a lot of detail behind the plot.  I was not aware of this kind of ability to craft a novel.<br />The plot is gritty and real, and the delivery is powerful.  This shows an intimacy with the material that is probably unexpected, but it lends strength to the work.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I am loving match three games. I have been playing games by Playrix and have not been disappointed yet.  Have a kindle fire the game is great on it. So if you like match three games you won't be disappointed with this one.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|Its supposed to be \\"science\\" fiction not science absurdity. When the \\"scientist\\" takes off his helmet 30 minutes into it you know things are going to go down hill. I would say a 3rd grader would know better than to do that. Needless to say the CGI and locations are impressive, that's pretty easy now days, but really almost anyone could improve the story. A child could have improved the story. The monster had to get on board, the way it does that is just beyond belief. Suspension of disbelief is part of any movie but this one... stretches that to absurd levels. Almost as if they tried to write a script in a week for a 125 million dollar movie. Why the hell would they do that? Totally sloppy. I mean really REALLY sloppy. Did they mix up pages from the round file? Story makes no sense even from the creation point of \\"mystery\\" view.<br /><br />I'd almost rather they used the entire time to fly the camera over Scotland and Iceland which are so beautiful in their harshness. Forget the \\"science fiction\\" just give me visuals of the beautiful landscapes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have the full version of MC on my PC but wanted this version to take with  me. It isn't as compleat as the PC version but my Android doesn't have the capabilities of my PC either, I do hope they update it some but Idon't think my tablet  could handle the full version.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I hoped this movie would be at least acceptable but also thought that the weekend special price made it okay to stop watching if it was not so good. It was really good and the cast was fantastic.
0679731725|5.0|After reading Never Let Me Go I should have assumed that this story would be just as heartbreaking, but for some reason I was optimistic. Mistake. Of course it's absolutely beautiful, it's witty and charming and provides a beautiful picture of English culture. Basically if Carson from Downton Abbey wrote a memoir, it would be this book.<br /><br />But mixed in with this charm is an undercurrent of sadness too strong to ignore and too subtle to make you stop reading. From the butler's family life, to his committment to a Lord who makes all the wrong choices, something about the story is sad on such a deep level you almost can't grasp it. One review calls it \\"beautiful and cruel\\", and I can't think of a better way to put it.<br /><br />What astounds me about Ishiguro as an author is how well-crafted his stories are. He gives away exactly the right amount at each turn to keep you intrigued and confused, until you hit that one moment of realization (which, turns out, isn't even at the climax of the story). There's almost two separate arcs: the arc of the actual plot and its climax, and the arc of your understanding as a reader. These books are so controlled, the prose and the tone is absolutely flawlessly at odds with the subtext.<br /><br />I think he's definitely become one of my favorite writers this year, but I'm a little afraid to read any more of his books just because they evoke almost too much emotion.
B0011TMGKG|5.0|I love all the Lazaze toys for babies and this one is as cute as they come.  My grandbaby loves all the little tags around the head and there are plenty of teething rings for him to chew on.  It also fits really nicely over the handle of his carrier, stroller, car- seat.  I love this lion.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best video game I've ever seen. I have it for the PC. And also the Xbox 360. And I've Had it for the Kindle accouple of weeks.  This may cost $7 but it is worth it.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|this movie didn't get the best reviews at the theatres -they were really wrong - it is really hilarious with Tom, Alec and Russell. Too funny.  Also the music was great - Tom can really sing, what a surprise. Catherine Zeta-Jones was a great surprise with her singing and dancing.  Loved it all.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is basically a dreamboard platform. You post all the things you like and other people can share your idea. I love it because I used to buy cardboard for dreamboards all the time,  spend hours cutting and glueing but now... ive saved trees and time. Its also a lot easier to find.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Call of Atlantis is one of the best Amazon FAOTD that should not be missed by anyone who is a fan of match 3/puzzle games.  It is a gem of a game,  and extremely fun!
B0081L37Z0|5.0|This movie is the best around and no one is going to ever hold this movie down. I would not change one thing about this wonderful movie.
B002VX3RCW|5.0|Once more, a terrific product from Lazame.  Their baby toys are so colorful and fun for little ones.  They fit to well over the handles of car seats, strollers, carriers.  This one has lots of chewies on the tail and the 'knight' is in a perfect place for a young baby to grab easily.  The feet make crinkly noises which my grandbaby loves and the tags on the saddle entertain him for ages.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I love Ken Follett's books, but I didn't love this one.  If you are a person my age, 85, you have lived through this book  I remember everything about those years, so it was boring.  Also, the skipping around is a little disconcerting and the difficult names.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So awesome &lt;3 I really love the app. Not glitchy. Works wonderfully. I use it all the time. Easy and fun.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|The more practical way to keep sharp your knives. After a couple of months using it and still working just fine. With the stick i can sharp my serrated pocket knife pretty well. Great product.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read all the books in the trilogy and enjoyed it a lot! Very romantic and well written. I would highly recommend this!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Good read, I am a retire Vet of 22 years in the Air Force I worked for Gen Creech during the  Iran hostage crisis and saw the pain in his face when he went to Dover to receive are falling  Airmen after the Iranian released them. He said this would never happen again and he was right..He was instrumental in starting the Rapid Deployment Force which was the precursor to what we have today all of the services special forces working together to protect what is in the interest of the United States.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|I really thought this book would be entertaining and detailed. It was a big disappointment. It was a bore to read for the most part. It was obviously heavily edited by the author's military bosses. The entertainment value was zero.
B009FZZFME|3.0|I don't fault Amazon and the agreement they have. That's why it is an average rating. Amazon could do a better job of making the air times more prominent. I am sure their agreement is a 'non-compete' sort of thing that doesn't allow it to air current episodes at the same time as AMC. I am VERY disappointed with Dish. I called to cancel and they made this seem like the perfect solution. They didn't mention that they don't air concurrently with AMC. When my contract is up with Dish in July '13, I will cancel. Until then, this delay thing will have to work. Booooooooooo to Dish!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great great great! well worth the read. Actually read in 2 days couldn‘t put it down. oh what will be next?
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book has a very captivating story of love and loss. GET IT NOW. random six words that i need to put in.
B006OV7RQ4|1.0|Most of the movie is a recollection of trauma of a girl. You wait for some explanation, development and conclusion, waiting for the ending. And like in some cheap paranormal or horror movies, the surprise is that ...there is no explanation, no development and above all, NO ENDING.<br />A total waste of time.
B005LAII8K|5.0|Everybody is entitled to their opinion but to say this movie is one of the worst movie ever, that's just utter nonsense (As some of the reviews say). In fact, this movie is brilliant from start to finish. Everything is interconnected, well thought-out, and the ending is beyond what I could ever wish for. The last time I was so amazed by the ending was in \\"Sixth Sense\\" and \\"Unbreakable\\".
B002ECQQZU|1.0|I ordered this movie from two places trying to watch it on my big screen TV. All I can do is watch it on my computer. Didn't watch it. It was on TV on Spike a day later.Paid $9.99 and I think $2.00 for the movies. Not to happy.
0385336810|5.0|I was hesitant to read a book by an author I have not read before, but I am glad I took the risk. I could not put it down. It was a cute, fun read. My only complaint is that I finished the book too fast :) The plot is a little predictable, but I loved reading about Emma's little misadventures. I would love to see this story continued.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Another amazing book by Rick Riordan. Just as great as all his previous books, i loved it beyond belief!!!!!!!!!! We got to know annabeth alot better,see percy from other peoples perspectives and gather information from the past. I would suggest anybody 6+ coud read it.
1936850028|5.0|This was a thoroughly entertaining read full of insight and humor into the collective minds of the cross country ski community.  The bonk, rollerski crashes, training partner camaraderie, the daze of race day, it is all in here.  If you are a skier, you can read along and imagine yourself right there, and if you aren't a skier (and you should be), you can get a glimpse into the mind of a skier.<br /><br />I raced a lot in high school and took a long hiatus.  I'm signed up for my first Birkie this year and I can tell you the fever has already hit and its 131 days to race day.  This book didn't do anything to reduce the fever, but I enjoyed every page.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This is a typical match 3 but has really vibrant colors and an extra &quot;match the artifact&quot; at the end of each level.
B00976NY6A|3.0|this is a lame attempt for such a long wait. maybe the next one will be better. just doesn't have the ballz of their previous music.
B0098VYKSA|2.0|It just drug on, and on, and on. There was so much potential for the story to get good, so I hung in there till the end, but it never did get good.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Like action? Liam Neeson kicks butt!! You are gonna love it! Matter of fact you are going to want to get Taken 2 when it is on DVD.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|A very good read. A book you have to read, a book which descibes the fact that even if you come from the most bizarre family/background you can survive and eventually obtain a decent and satisfying life.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|I know its free but only ten songs sucks and whenever I try to download the other version it says error in trying to download. and this version is ok but could be better
B003UD7JEE|5.0|Wow, I am so happy that I was bored enough to check out an episode when I saw the previews for this show.  I got hooked while watching this nonstop on Netflix and purchased both seasons just now.  I really wish that they would advertise this show more as a lot of my friends never even heard about Nikita before.  I love how it is so unpredictable with so many twists that keep my eyes wide open wondering what is going to happen next.  I am really good at predicting movies/shows but with this one I am clueless as to what will happen next.  Even things that I WANT to happen do, like certain people who get killed or who joins the good side.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I purchased this for my 9 year old, and now find that the whole family from 4 year old to my husband and me enjoy playing it.  I like that it makes the kids think, and of course, who doesn't love Perry? We subsequently purchased similar games from Disney, which might be more detailed.  Wish the graphics around Perry were a little more fun.  Other than that, we've thoroughly enjoyed it.
B003L77G06|5.0|Tired of Reality TV?  Want some actual writing and acting?  If you missed the early episodes or (like me) just love them so much you can watch them again and again, this is a must buy.
B004X4QW42|5.0|This was a fanaminal action packed movie!; with enough action to match the story. Not too much of either one.  the first Ip Man movie is good; but in my opinon, The second one is the best. More fight scenes in this one and as i mentioned above, The story line isn't  overtaking the fight scenes.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this fun addicting game its to much fun u cant or don't wanna put it down!!!!!!! :) (:<br />#100&trade;% Addiction
B004SIPAJG|5.0|A delightful journey watching a champion dancer being pulled by by competing forces: his overbearing mother who thinks she knows what is best for his career; and his heart, which pulls him away from the expected norm and launches him to \\"dance his own steps...\\"  Paul Mercurio is fabulous as Scott Hastings.  The ending dance alone is worth the price of the film!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I'm still in love with this show :) I love all the characters still and it always intresrs me. I also love that I watch the episodes through Amazon. I do not like watching commercials on tv or through cbs website (which is worse then tv. I either watch on a computer, xbox 360 or playstation 3. Anyway, I hope there are some Tiva moments soon, would be awesome! :)<br />Anyway, great season so far. Excited for the next episode.
B005EHILV4|4.0|Great little mixer, I use it to rip vinyl from my Technics 1200 into Garageband on my MacBook Pro 13\\". Unfortunately the 13\\" Macbooks only have a single audio in/out so I needed a way to input my signal while still using my headphones to monitor. This mixer was the perfect solution as it lines audio in via USB rather than through a 1/4\\" pin where I need to plug in my headphones. Haven't had any problems and the sound is great. Ideally it could use more EQ's on the board but I can adjust that in Garageband before mixdown. Recommended!
B000G73U5Y|5.0|The Definitive Collection from Steeley Dan is a great CD which, in my case, replaces the one my former girlfriend failed to return.
B009AJD5E0|3.0|I am going with a three because the intensity of Alien and Aliens was not there. Additionally, the twists of plot were not sufficiently strong enough to meet expectations. Finally, this was the time to tie up loose ends, answer questions from the predecessor movies. It didn't even attempt to answer it's own questions and indeed seemed more intent on bashing Christians for their faith than horrifying movie goers.<br /><br />Lots of great computer graphics, yes, but this is a Sci-Fi HORROR movie and frankly I never jumped. It was NOT horrific. I have to hold Ridley Scott accountable because he clearly knows what works and what doesn't. Hollywood has got to separate itself from politics. At least they didn't bash or blame George Bush - something a lot of flicks still do to this day.<br /><br />The cast was fairly seasoned, yet the acting was more horrific than the \\"horror scenes.\\"<br /><br />The scenes with the greatest potential for real horror seemed to be abbreviated. Showing me odd, gross, weird, disgusting things does not horror make. True horror makes one jump, maybe yell out an expletive, throw their popcorn barrel and/or turn away. The problem is this movies never drew me into the scenes like Alien and Aliens did. In those movies, I was right there with the crew, horrified, running, screaming; as the aliens moved in.<br /><br />How do you know when a movie isn't working? You find yourself checking email while the movie runs in the background.<br /><br />Was it worth $3.99 rental?  Yes. The novelty of it being the prequel to Alien makes it worth seeing...once. Would I own it? NO!<br /><br />The rental did include two bonus features at the end, after the credits --that was a nice extra.<br /><br />The best scenes were the opening scenes of Iceland and were probably worth the $3.99. Gorgeous land, that! Incredible.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Thanks for reading my reviews.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|I love Jack Reacher novels but this one fell a little flat.  It starts out as a real page-turner and keeps building but never seemed to reach the climax I was expecting.  The end of the book made me feel like Mr. Child just got tired of writing the book so Jack Reacher wanders off into the sunset.
B003G4W49C|4.0|OSC's Ender's Game is a great expansion on several intriguing ideas that he put forth in his award winning short story. The book takes an interesting vision of the future, adds several very likable characters and produces an enjoyable read that transcends the sci-fi genre and appeals to a wide range of readers.
B009AJDDQU|1.0|I had high hopes but this movie was just cheese. If you can overlook the hard to swallow plot and illogical actions of the crew it felt like a bad bad remix of the alien movies.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not quite as good as the first, felt a little like a repeat. nonetheless excellent story. cant wait to finish the next book.
B002JC9RMY|5.0|This is one of the better made movies in recent time.  Mr. Wong is one of the best directors and it really comes through on this movie.  I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Martial Arts.
B0031Q0XCA|4.0|Good movie with surprising ending, not your typical hollywood love story. Good price, easy to view via Vizio TV with Amazon app.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Works smooth on my phone and is fun.  Got it on the free app a day but thos would be worth buying.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is a great book. It leads you right back to the first book in the seiries. Love Ken Follett
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I really looked forward to this film, for several reasons including the fact it was a prequel to one of the best movies in my collection. I saw the display at the theater last year and had it on my list to buy from that point on. I don't do many movies in the theater. I prefer to buy them later on Blu-Ray and save the money. It's cheaper to own most movies than to take my wife and myself to the theater, and we can watch at our leisure.<br /><br />While I was waiting for delivery I started reading some of the reviews and found out it left a lot to be desired. It was a good movie, and since I no longer expected it to be on the same level as Alien, I enjoyed it. I try to watch movies for the entertainment value alone, and if it is something I really enjoy then go back and watch to see if I can find deeper meaning and mistakes. Knowing some of this movies mistakes ahead of time made it a little harder to do that, but, it made me understand I should not expect quite the movie I'd planned to see.<br /><br />That being said, it was a good movie. It was entertaining, it did have some character build out. The affects were great, it was fun to see the ship design, the image of the \\"Engineer\\" in his control seat with his helmet on that matched what we saw in Alien on the crashed ship. The shape of the ships, the development of the creatures as they assimilated DNA from their hosts. Even the corridors in the base brought back images from the Alien movie.<br /><br />I recommend this movie, BUT, I recommend you sit down to watch it without the assumption you will be blown away like the first Alien movie did. If you approach it looking for an entertaining movie, you should enjoy it as well.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is the first trilogy, in fact, the first book I have read that enchanted me in so many ways. Not my typical type of reading and a \\"first\\" for me too. :) I sure hope to hear more is to come soon.

B007MNV5WU|5.0|Graphics are great.  New views for \\"angry birds\\".  Fun to use, though sometimes the birds go shooting off into empty space when I mean them to hit an object.  My grandson who is 6 can do different things with the birds, than can I.  Hmm.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Very intersting book.  The end was a little abrupt for me but it did wrap up very nicely.  Good writing holds your interest and keeps you guessing.  Definitely recommend.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I did not buy this item for myself, but for my grandsons ages eight & six.  They simply love it.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|At first, I thought I would not finish it. Just another melodrama about the old south. However, the story was good and I enjoyed reading it because, once I accepted that it was just \\"a story\\", it was engaging. It did give one mild insights into that world. I would recommend it to someone as a vacation/beach book. Every book does not have to teach you something. Reading is a pastime, as well.

030758836X|2.0|... only because a Hollywood Ending is already written into novel. Great suspense and buildup, only to succumb to one of the worst endings in literary history. I'd have given it one star if not for the fact that I must give Ms. Flynn a little bit of credit for really luring me in -- I read the book in two days because I really couldn't put it down. Now I see myself never being able to stop putting it down -- in the other sense of the expression!

0316228532|1.0|After watching Rowlings on TV interview, was very anxious to get book from local library. Put name on the waiting list and hurried to library once called.  There is NO WAY I can make myself finish reading the dull, dreary, depressing book.  Only half way through I have taken notes and there are 47 characters thus far! I have really, really tried hard to get into this book.  I stopped to come read reviews here to see if it was just me.  Thank goodness I'm not going crazy and others feel as I do.
B007U4DIM6|4.0|BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA 3 is defintely a movie for young kids. Adults without kids may find this movie too silly to be enjoyable yet BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA 3 is full of charm and some humor for kids of all ages. Papi and Chloe are back with the kids and their \\"humans\\" have gotten a job in a very posh Beverly Hills hotel that caters to both humans and dogs.<br />BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA 3 is good natured and fun. It does go overboard in camp with dogs in costumes acting and talking like humans. Of course, that is the charm of the film. There is also a good lesson here for kids about accepting others who are different. The lesson centers around little Rosa, who is the runt of her parents' litter. She is small in size but huge in heart and dedication and will prove that dogs of all sizes are equals.<br />This would be a fun movie to watch with young kids. I imagine the joy and wonder they would experience watching dogs dressing and acting like humans. It is less appealing for adults alone but I had my share of chuckles. Certainly, the scene of Chloe doing a piano recital (and a darn fantastic one) in front of an audience was priceless--that scene alone was worth watching.<br />Although this movie was direct to video, the quality is A+ and it seems like BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA 3 should have been a theatrical movie. Families are eager to find cute movies for their kids to see in theaters.<br />BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA 3 is the perfect movie for kids and for families with young kids. This is a great movie for adults to enjoy with their young kids on family night.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Fifty Shades of Grey was very easy to read.  It kept my interest all the way through.  It was very sexy, which is what I expected.  It isn't for someone who gets embarassed by bad language or sexual content.

B0098VYCCE|2.0|The trailer made it look like a great movie. But it never got off the ground. When it ended, it left no thoughtful perspectives, no lingering emotions... nothing. A walk thru an uninspiring landscape.

B007LE2VDM|5.0|I was just in Vegas and saw her perform with Jason Mraz. I bought her album right away. Touching lyrics, perfectly composed melodies, brilliantly vocals. She's even better live. If she comes to your town, do NOT miss it!!! Every song on this album is a masterpiece. Period. If I had to pick just one song, I'd say The Lonely, but it's difficult to pick a fav. BUY IT! Do it! You will not regret it!
B008J34466|5.0|I love P!nk, and this album is as true to her amazing style as all the greats!  The fun lyrics meld with her voice so well and the collaboration between P!nk and Nate Ruess of Fun and Eminem where perfect pitch choices.
0451232852|5.0|I just finished reading this book and can't wait to start the next one in the trilogy. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to read and likes history. I am personally not a big fan of reading about history but this book tells what happened in the perspective of people experiencing it first hand. From the soldiers on the front line to the couple seperated by international border, this book has it all.
1611761565|5.0|There are not words to express the gratitude that could ever tell the team how fortunate this country is to have people in our country that are so determined in their missions and guard our freedoms in this country.  God bless them all. This book gave me insight to a world that is experienced by the courageous and the brave, our military gives me hope in a very dark and dangerous world.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I loved this movie! I was really looking forward to watching this since I didn't get to see it at the theater. On my 3D TV it was awesome! Most 3D Blu-ray's, with the exception of Tim Burton's adaptation of Alice In Wonderland, that are in my library, are great viewing and have a rich depthness to them. However, they are not as \\"good\\" as at the theater or from the 3D channels I get from my satellite provider-which are the BESt; with the exception of this movie! The plot, acting, directing-everything-was the best of any movie, 3D or otherwise, that I have seen all year! I am so glad I purchased this item!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Good theme but unrealistic. I was't engrossed so it took me longer than I expected to read. overall I'm interested in reading more
B004WGIXX4|5.0|It's been awhile since I have seen a chick flick and I was plesantly surprise by this one.  Every girl loves Ashton Kutcher and he did not disappoint in this.  Good story line.....the title tells you what to expect but it was still entertaning with a few surprises.  I have never really be a Natalie Portman fan but I like her in this.  Also Mindy Kaling is one of my fav comedic actors (I loved her in 40 yr old Virgin)  This film is in my top fav now :-)
B005S9ELM6|5.0|The Iranian Hostage Crisis has been over for more than 30 years, and for those who don't remember that time in history, it was a prominent domino on the path that led to 9/11.  Ben Affleck's direction of this true story is a compelling look back at that important time in U.S. history.  Mixing in news broadcasts, newspapers, magazines, and real-life people along with the actors in this movie, the film delivers a suspenseful and fast-moving 2 hours (an estimate only, don't harp if I'm off by a few minutes) that seem to go by in about an hour.  Affleck himself is at the center of the movie, but downplays his role and goes into the character without glamour or fanfare.<br /><br />This was an excellent movie, and one that I recommend strongly to just about anyone.
0062086529|4.0|Great book.  The hard pages are great for little fingers.  Gave it 4 out of 5 stars only because the illustration is not overly bright/entertaining for little ones.  However, it's a great little imagination story, and we like it.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to come to the android tablet.  My boyfriend has it on his Ipad and I loved playing it.  This game has hours of playing fun and gives you enough time to get through the screens.  I love playing this game!  You'll need to come up with different parts of the world and create a new one similar to it.

0385344333|5.0|Jack Reacher doesn't look for trouble. The retired Army cop with no home, no fixed location, not even a change of clothes, wanders the country minding his own business. But trouble always seems to find him - and it is always those who bring the trouble that wind up getting hurt.<br /><br /> Lee Child experiments with the basic Jack Reacher from time to time, usually successfully, sometimes disastrously when he ventured into politics and again when he spent way too many pages proving that he wasn't too good at writing sex scenes for Reacher.<br /><br /> \\"A Wanted Man\\", however, is almost pitch-perfect Reacher.<br /><br /> Reacher is a big guy, 6'5\\" tall. At the moment we first encounter  him, he is standing by an expressway ramp, his thumb outstretched, his clothes dirty and his nose visibly broken.<br /><br /> It's early winter in Nebraska and it appears unlikely that anyone would want Reacher as a travel companion.<br /><br /> But a car with two men and a woman stops for Reacher.<br /><br /> Not many miles away from where Reacher hitches a ride, local Sheriff Goodman and FBI agent Julia Sorenson are investigating the murder of a stranger in an abandoned water pumping station. We learn that there is a huge aquifer underlying the Midwestern states and that this pumping station once pulled water out of it. Though no longer in use, its pipes go straight down into the water. The story begins to take on added dimension as it is revealed that the State Department, the CIA and the FBI's counter-terrorism operation all have an interest in this apparently pointless murder.<br /><br /> Okay, now you can read the dust jacket and get all the information I've just given you.  I don't like dropping spoilers, so I'm going to stop talking about the details of the story.<br /><br /> It doesn't take long before Reacher is dealing with questions about his benefactors.  At the same time, Goodman and Sorenson are being faced a rapidly changing situation. This is pure Lee Child - the man plots well and constantly produces plausible surprises.<br /><br /> Within a hundred pages, Child takes Reacher (and, through Reacher, the reader) through some very clever gyrations - with lots more to come.<br /><br /> Happily - and I don't this is a spoiler - there is no sex in this novel. Lee Child simply doesn't write very good sex scenes and he seems to have learned his lesson. Unhappily for many Reacher fans, including me, he doesn't kill, maim or hurt a lot of people until close to the end. Reacher's violence and the ways he deploys it are a big part of Reacher's appeal as a character.<br /><br /> Characters, by and large, are well-defined. The main characters are developed in depth, for the most part, and the minor characters get as much depth as the story requires.<br /><br /> Things start getting complicated but never to the point of silliness.<br /><br /> Ultimately, of course, Reacher figures out all the big and little mysteries and triumphs over the bad guys.<br /><br /> If you haven't read a Jack Reacher thriller before, you can start with this one. If you're an old hand with Reacher, I think you'll appreciate that Lee Child did an excellent job here.<br /><br /> I polished \\"A Wanted Man\\" off in two nights and enjoyed every page of it.<br /><br />Jerryplots well and constantly produces plausible surprises.<br /><br /> Within a hundred pages, Child takes Reacher (and, through Reacher, the reader) through some very clever gyrations - with lots more to come.<br /><br /> Happily - and I don't this is a spoiler - there is no sex in this novel.

B007THA4FI|5.0|Definitely not Harry Potter, but just as engaging for adults.  And it is for adults only.<br /><br />Think Love Actually without all the good-Christmasy vibe.  The Casual Vacancy takes real life and puts it into the perspective of several families entwined together through work, school, and civic duties.  It is life, nothing is fair, and we all just plod along doing our best to live it--with the occasional fantasy, back stab, paranoia, and utter disagreement, to put it lightly.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book better than 50 Shades. Gideon Cross sounds more normal \\"sexually\\" he's not into all that whips and bonding stuff like Christian Grey. He sounds even yummier than Christian Grey oh boy!
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|A basic match-three game, appropriate permissions, decent graphics, contrived &quot;story line.&quot; A very hard sell at five bucks, or even two bucks, considering the competition.<br />Too bad the developer had to resort to flooding the app with obviously fake five-star reviews.
1455502758|5.0|There have been so many beautiful reviews, especially the one from \\"Red on Black\\", that it seems superfluous to add another, but I will do so, simply to pay homage to the man who will always in my mind be \\"The Great Christopher Hitchens.\\"<br /><br />He is no less great in his final book, despite having been transported across the border from \\"Welltown\\" to \\"Tumortown.\\"  The wit and humor sparkle, clever as ever.  The honesty is blatant, even to the point where he reproduces an extremely ugly comment from a website of \\"the faithful\\", a comment which maintains that Christopher has cancer in his \\"throat\\", which is \\"the one part of his body he used for blasphemy.\\"  Sorry, Mr/Ms Faithful, but the cancer was esophageal, and Christopher stresses this.  It would be impossible to commit blasphemy with one's esophagus, which is the passage down which our food travels.  He realizes, however, and says so, that his lifestyle which included much smoking, drinking, and burning the candle at both ends (which \\"casts a lovely light\\"), was the most probable cause of his tumor, and there is a half-rueful crossness with himself for not being more aware and careful, given that his father had died from the same cancer.  In replying to Mr/Ms Faithful's utter nastiness, he refers to his \\"so far uncancerous throat\\" and assures us that \\"that is not AT ALL the only organ\\" with which he has blasphemed, and that he \\"shall continue to write polemics against religious delusions ...\\"  \\"In which case, why not cancer of the brain?\\"  Very well put, Mr Hitchens.<br /><br />In spite of metastases, side effects of chemotherapy and radiation, excruciating pain, false hopes, unwanted advice, various pneumonias, and the terrifying and intermittent loss of his voice, he remains clear, argumentative, playful, and finds room to gently tease about Blaise Pascal's 17th century \\"wager\\" regarding faith and death.  He also has a bit of serious fun in proposing a \\"cancer etiquette handbook\\" which could make for lessawkwardness between those living in Welltown and those in Tumortown.<br /><br />His refutation of the frequently repeated (usually attributed to Nietzsche) \\"Whatever doesn't kill me makes me stronger\\" is neat and comprehensive, but he interestingly includes one possible exception to his \\"emerging rule that Nietzsche was to be distrusted\\":  The short period when he found himself psychologically stronger, in that he \\"began to take on the role of morale-booster.\\"  This palled after a while, when he realized that the bluffing on his part was not making him or anyone else stronger or more cheerful.  The view that an outcome to severe illness can be affected by morale, he intimates, belongs in the realm of illusion.<br /><br />The final chapter of jottings is, as \\"Red on Black\\" writes, the most affecting part of the book.  Still clear, still deeply thoughtful, the brief lines and paragraphs indicate his weariness;  an almost total lack of physical strength.<br /><br />Thank you, Christopher Hitchens, for sharing your life and thoughts so generously with the rest of us, for teaching us much and well, and for the delightful example you gave us of living fully.  You are, and will be, deeply missed.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|Fifty Shades of Gray grabs you in the minute you start reading it.  I don't think its the sex that pulls you in, its the story.  Its a deep, compelling, dark, mysterious story with a character that is so uncertain you can't wait to turn the next page to find out what happens. The main character, Mr. Gray is not the type of man a woman would ever want to meet, but it sure is exciting to read about him.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone girl was a great story about a strange love between a man, Nick and his wife, Amy.  It kept the reader, me reading far into the night.  I really felt for Nick and the predicament Amy put him in and wondering if he would be able to turn the tables on her.  The ending was a bit to quick. I was hoping for more.
0553801473|4.0|I had read a great deal of reviews on here and as a result was apprehensive in buying the 5th book . After completing book 4 though I was like a rabid dog and needed my fix so decided to bite the bullet and give the 5th book a whirl.<br /><br />You should know that due to the severe negativity of all the reviews I went in with really poor expectations and quite possible could have enhanced my own pleasure of the book. That is, I was consistently and pleasantly surprised with the content of the book. I was even trying to figure out exactly why people were being so angry. Storywise, the book has a ton of heavy twists and small story-arcs. A lot happens to a lot of characters. Enough so that I was voraciously reading through and finished the book in half the time of the previous books.<br /><br />I think what really made people angry about this one though is that while a lot happens, very little comes in the way of moving toward the bigger underlying story arc of the book, which is the whole wights and their masters and what role the dragons will play, etc...I think this is ultimately what people are most annoyed about. The book was just as well written and in many ways better than the previous ones, but it lacks any real form of closure. It basically gives the reader the equivalent of \\"literary blue balls\\".<br /><br />That being said, i'm still lined up to read book 6 and greatly enjoyed the majority of this book and I think most fans of the previous book would to. Just go in knowing that you won't see much movement in the greater story arc.
1423140605|4.0|I love this series and highly recommend it.  That being said, you need to read (or re read -- its been a year since the last book) the earlier installments to fully understand what is going on.  The book alternates viewpoints among the main characters -- something the author has done in the past two books -- but with seven main characters this makes the book a bit choppy.  While I enjoyed the viewpoints, I wanted more depth-- the character development seems more superficial and less integral to the story.  The ending is totally -- well, if you read it, you can fill in the expletive yourself.<br /><br />Plot summary with spoilers:  The seven chosen demigods flee New Rome after a disastrous initial meeting.  They fly in Leo's spankin' hot war machine (susceptible to battle damage and lack of spare parts) to various points on their quest leading to (old) Rome.  The god's are mostly incapacitated due to the differences between their Greek and Roman natures.  Annabeth has a quest within a quest given to her by her raving mother Athena (who resents being Minerva to a homicidal extent).  The lucky seven heroes are looking for their friend (or frenemy) Nico who is wrapped up in the prophecy as well.  By the end the quest is largely a success -- with the next challenge being the surviving demigods hoping that their fallen (literally) comrades can somehow meet them at the Doors of Death.
B0053O89RY|5.0|I found this season to be as funny as the last 2 seasons.  The characters continue to keep you laughing out loud and the dynamics of this family makes it a favorite.  Just started catching up with Season 4-sooo good.
B0053O89KG|5.0|DVD cover sux, but castle/becket are awsome as always!!  They return in the fourth season after Beckett's shooting.  A witty game of cat and mouse played throughout the fourth season ending in a thrilling finale. Highly recommended.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|This was a fun movie,will it get an Oscar ummm no but if your looking for great looking men a time to just sit back and not have to think this has been done before and think again why cant anyone come up with something new then this is it.I went with other women but there were many men there also and we enjoyed the six packs,the tight rears and I have to say I wish they had showed more dancing then they did.I liked the story and I cant say enough it was just fun,will I be there to buy it OMG I will be right there so come on just watch and plan for a good time.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is very helpful. it will tell you what your battery level is without going to settings, voice how low your level is, and tell you how much time you have playing certain apps. (I play minecraft a lot so it comes in<br />handy.)

B008Y1YK9Y|2.0|I loved the zaniness of the original Men in Black. The sequel couldn't match the original, but at least had some funny moments. But I just don't get the decision to even make Men in Black 3. It's not as if the world was screaming for a sequel.<br /><br />Indeed, MIB3 lacks the humor of its predecessors. It tries to be a character story about Agent J and Agent K's origins. However, neither character is particularly interesting or worthy of a movie outside the trademark MIB humor. Agent J is just Will Smith being Will Smith, while Agent K is dour and humorless.<br /><br />MIB as a franchise just isn't about compelling characters - it's about alien gags. And MIB3 had surprisingly few aliens or alien humor, outside a bar fight in a Chinese restaurant and the main villain, Boris the Animal. Even the little cigar-shaped aliens only get a cameo.<br /><br />MIB3 is worth watching for fans of MIB, but it's a somewhat pointless end to the trilogy.
B0094JX07I|5.0|If you not a fan of Billy Talent I don't know why.  They're an amazing band, and I recommend them to all my friends and they fall in love just as quickly.  Check this album out and the previous you will not be disappointed.

B005O64VJQ|5.0|These four actors have such a great chemistry.  I also have Fierce Creatures which I love.  I wish they would make more movies together.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Fox has certainly treated the Alien franchise well. This DVD set is packed with special features, including commentaries for all of the films, deleted scenes, and making of documentaries for each movie.<br /><br />If you have a blu-ray player, make sure to get the blu-ray Alien Anthology, with many of the same features and not much more expensive than this DVD set.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|The Hunger Games takes an intriguing concept \\"What if teenagers were forced to fight each other to the death?\\" and weaves an interesting, complex story based mostly on the book of the same name (which I haven't read). I was a little surprised how long it took to get to the game portion of the film, but it was time well spend. After the games began, the tension ratcheted up several notches.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't care for were the conveniently-placed voice-overs that changed the rules of the game at just the right/wrong time. I would have thought the director could have done better, but then again, the director is Gary Ross, who's one of the best, so I'm assuming he did the best he could.<br /><br />I recommend The Hunger Games, although it's not for the faint-of-heart.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|THIS WAS A GREAT BOOK!  All Ken Follett  books are good, but so far this trilogy (Fall of the Giants and now Winter of the World) was exceptional.  Can hardly wait for the final book of the trilogy.  These books are very informative, and explains a lot about history.  I like the fact that the 2nd book follows the characters created in the 1st book.  I recommend the book to all interested in history.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could read these books over and over again :) they are amazing!!! I recommend them to anyone over the age of 17

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I could not put it down. Very well written, great plot development and I didn't have to read the same details over and over and over again as in many other series. I am sad to say I have reached the end, but happy that I may actually get some stuff done when I'm not at work now!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was a great game and thanks to the hints I didn't get too frustrated. Even with the hints you still have to think. I thoroughly enjoyed this game.
B0009PAVI2|2.0|The pouches are too tight. it takes a bit of an effort to take it out and put it back in for 67mm filter
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|After sticking through season two, which was alot of looking for a little girl and standing around on a farm waiting for something to happen, I hoped that they'd pick up the pace a little with season three.  The premiere doesn't dissapoint!  Everything has been taken up a notch.<br /><br />In 44 minutes we watch the group try to establish a new home, meet new characters, and see how dynamics have changed.  After a winter on the road between seasons two and three, some people are closer together, some more distant.  The writing and acting are superb, able to convey those changed relationships with just a moment of genuine tenderness or a couple of lines of dialogue.<br /><br />The special effects are better than last season as well, with walkers (and walker takedowns) more impressive.<br /><br />Pacing was great in this episode.  The pauses where the group catches their breath feel the same way for you - a little breather before going back into the fray.  It ends with and INTENSE ten minutes that'll only leave you wanting more.  Strong work!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a wonderful interpretation of the modern-day teenager that reflects the different types of things that todays teenagers go through. Charlie was such a relatable character and made the whole novel seem like Charlie was one of todays teenagers. This book was so good, it is now my favorite novel of all time.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love this trilogy!  While it can be very explicit, it is extraordinary writing!  Ms. James ability to make you feel for the characters is beyond anyone I've read to date!  Look forward to many more novels!!!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book, Was it written the best, NO, was it crude, Yes ( to much for my taste) however if you can get beyond all of that, They story line was GREAT. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good read.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|This movie was more than just thrilling, it was absolutely a joy to watch.  I was literally scared silly during some parts of the movie.

B00011CZRE|5.0|**May be a spolier**<br />There is a constant rain over the big city as the movie is opening. Dectective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is getting ready to retire and get away from the gloomy city. Before his retirement, he is teamed up with a young, cocky, short tempered Detective Mills (Brad Pitt). Thier first investigation is of an obese man who ate untill he exploded. As they are investigating the obese man, they get called to another murder. On the floor next to the man was the word \\"Greed\\" writen in blood. The detectives get a call saying that there were plastic bits in the obese man's stomach. They go back to the obese man's house to do further investigations. Somerset finds marks on the floor by the refridgerator that match the plastic pieces perfectly. He moves it back and finds 'Gluttony' writen in grease on the wall. Somerset concludes that the murders are based on the seven deadly sins, and that there were five more to go. The detectives go back to do more investigations of the greed murder. They notice that a picture is upside down on the wall. The foreinsics team find finger prints that make out the words 'help me'. They identify the fingerprints and go to the apartment of the suspect. They find a man, barely alive, who was missing his tongue and hand. The wall above him read 'sloth'. Detective Somerset decides to do some research on the seven deadly sins and goes to the library. He gets a list of all the books of the seven deadly sins and a list of people who checked them out. He comes to the conclusion that a man named John Doe may be behind it all. The detectives go to the apartment to confront Doe, but he fights against them and gets away. They investigate his apartment and find thousands of journals on his thoughts in the room. They also find many pictures of his victims. They find a picture of Mills, when he was bombarded with the press about the murders. They conclude that Doe took them meaning that he had been that close to Mills. They find a picture of a prostitute who is most likely the next victim. Sure enough, they go to a club to find a woman murdered by a deadly S&M 'toy'.They get a call about a model who was found dead with the words 'pride writen by her. She was forced to either take pills and OD or live with a scared face. Being pridefull, she chose to die. John Doe walks into the police station and turns himself in. His hands are bleeding because he would remove the skin on his fingers so he couldnt be identified. After talking with his lawyer, he asked the detectives if they could take him to the two remaining bodies. He agrees that he would confess after. Wanting the confession, the detectives agree. The ending is mind blowing. Watch it to see how it ends. It's amazing.

B005SFR7YE|5.0|This 25th anniversary Cameron Macintosh production is excellent from the opening curtain... the Royal Albert Hall is magnificent and a perfect setting for this period musical/opera.  Staging, lighting, sets, costumes, dancing, orchestra, voices... all are top notch.  Some will think no one can surpass Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman in the original... Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Bogguss are excellent and interpret the roles beautifully.  After the final curtain call, the appearance of Andrew Lloyd Webber, past & present crews, and performances by Sarah Brightman and four former Phantoms (and Ramin) add a special, personal touch to a thoroughly enjoyable evening!  I've purchased 6 DVDs to give as gifts :)

0307959856|3.0|As so often the group was in two minds about a book. For some this was neither a decent detective mystery nor an effective sequel to an Austen novel. As a mystery it appeared unsolvable by tthe readers since the villain was produced from the margins of the narrative and anyway appeared to ill to commit the murder. As a pastiche to amuse Janeites it also failed since it lacked the original's wit and humour as well as her precise economical way of summing up character and situation. However some readers in our group thought this was the wrong way to judge the book, and that it should be regarded as a clever farce. Writing two centuries later than the original publication date of the novels with all the licence of a spoof, James was now able to to play with Austen's characters. So for example she reveals Jane's heroines to have been cunning minxes in catching wealthy men in their neighbourhood as husbands in ways that Austen had to cloak in maidenly modesty when writing for her own audience. James was also free to suggest that Wickham was less of a bad character than Darcy had painted him, and to provide a lowly back story to explain some of Wickham's behaviour. However supporters and detractors alike felt that the writing lacked the sparkle and the wit of the original and that this was not one of the best books by Mames.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app is great. Its very clear and easy to understand. This app is clean and safe. I no longer even go into my settings to see my kindle fire battery life, I go straight here. The only thing I hope would be added is how much time left until my kindle dies that's all. Overall its a great convenient app.
0316228532|3.0|I saw all of the Harry Potters movies and enjoyed them. The first few more than the last ones. I know people who have read her books and was told how wonderful they were, so I was excited to read a book of hers. She is a good writer but the theme of this book was not my cup of tea.<br />I know that the private lives of people can often hold not so nice secrets but to have so many bad ones in such a small group of people was depressing. Others may have a different take on this but I just did not enjoy reading it. I would try her again, with hopes of a better story line.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|Nice product for the money good size light weight and comfortable.  As a lineman I can wear this  watch while working as it pretty much stays out of the way.  As far as it's ability to keep time goes it gets me to work on time and home on time it is as accurate as I need it to be. Not having a battery to run down us another point in it's favor.  I think it was worth the money no complaints.

B0058YPL66|5.0|I recall a quote from C.S. Lewis about how Christianity was \\"myth come to life\\", meaning all the myths and legends and all its archetypes that we know and love as children are found within the Bible... yet have been proven to be real, unlike any other book of \\"myths, legends, and fables\\", and I can see this show showing us how storytelling can have elements of real-life.<br />As it starts, it almost seems to be an allegory between life and the magic of life, with the magic world going backwards in its storytelling (think the reverse of Christopher Nolan's Memento). Then, unlike the real world, which goes straightforward in its presentation, the magic world has a jumpy timeframe, so you'd have to notice subtle references to know where in the storyline you are in certain episodes. And, like the show Grimm, this gives practicality to each story we've known since childhood as well as extra depth to each character and scenario.<br />Some characters are pretty much stubborn (like Emma Swann) in their unbelief about magic, using reality (and post-modernism) as a tenacious excuse on why they don't believe, nor wish to believe, until something tragic would happen to them. Others (like Emma's son) have literally child-like imagination and faith that it's real.<br />Throughout the show, there's bits and pieces of different types of faith, yet none are explicitly mentioned, which makes it that much more flexible for anyone from any religious background to enjoy without feeling their feathers get ruffled.<br />And, honestly, I thought I knew from the start who the true bad guy was (go figure with stories), then that gets changed (oh, wait, practicality in life, it can be shifty), and I'll admit, Robert Carlyle is as much his true self in getting into character as he has always been in any given movie he's been in, so when he's Mr. Gold, he's quite the manipulating human, yet when he's Rumpelstiltskin, he's quite the animated character, like a mix of devious trader and hyperactive child.<br />Truly, this was one story worth getting into and wishing to never have to escape from.e child.<br />Truly, this was one story worth getting into and wishing to never have to escape from.
0316212377|3.0|I have been an avid fan of The Culture since I first picked up \\"Consider Phlebas\\" and couldnt put it down until I finished it. Like others I find the mainly utopian Culture far more interesting than the many dystopian scenarios in the genre.<br />This novel while a lot weaker than the first few gives a big clue to the survival of the Culture--I've always felt it implausible somehow that these omnipotent Minds bother keeping the humanoids about--but it seems that the humans perform a necessary function--a type of crosscheck for general meanness, snidiness and evil-- to keep the Minds from self-sacrifice in dealing with other species--and we also see how a species which didnt allow their version of the Minds to evolve can be ruled by surprising barbarity.<br />All in all though this is a filler in rather than a great read and wouldnt convince a new reader to try the other books, which is a pity
B009AJDDQU|4.0|Why would anyone who isn't a fan of science fiction movies or space explorations take the time to watch this movie and then give a very low score? I would never watch a political or romantic movie and then write a bad review if I typically don't enjoy these type of films.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the Alien(s) or Star Trek movies, you might as well give this a rental until you get a sequel.<br /><br />According to the Science Quiz given by the reviewer who hated this film (shown under most critical helpful review), I agree there were some pretty stupid choices made by the crew which I noticed right away.  But after hearing all the bad reviews about the movie, I have to say I was very interested in what was going to happen next. Given the fact that the movie ends with no real answers to my disappointment I have to consider the fact that I was interested and entertained throughout the movie. Especially the uncomfortable squirming in my chair during a certain scene.<br /><br />My only gripe is I wish they would finally provide answers and get somewhere in all the of alien/predator movies. There is an alien encounter, something goes wrong, people die, there is a survivor, end of movie. I want more answers even if they are fictional ideas just to make you think.<br /><br />I have seen everything out right now and didn't have anything else to watch. I was glad I rented this.

B008LZHA3G|5.0|Having no expectations at all, I even hesitated in buying the record. I do not feel that Dylan is getting better as years go by, unlike his most fanatic fans claims. His latter work is far from mediocer, but lacks the energy that earlier work was so compressed with. But with \\"Tempest\\" he has really managed to dig deep and create a new morning. His stern, sandpaperscrubbed voice and brilliant storytelling skills make this record one of the top ten Dylan albums of all time. Surely the best album since Time out of Mind. At a time when I thought I would never again be excited over a new record or even come close to the feeling I had when I came home placing Desire on the turntable feeling life was really worth living for, I´m now happy to declare; It´s not over yet!

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I'm a big fan of coming of age stories like [[ASIN:B009NNXUJI Revenge Of A Band Geek Gone Bad]] and [[ASIN:0609807900 Sloppy Firsts (Jessica Darling, Book 1)]]. PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER is one of the best of its kind. Actually, it's one of the best books I've read -- period.<br /><br />The story is really simple: the narrator, Charlie, writes letters to a never-named friend about his freshman year of high school. Through his letters, which read like a journal, you get to know about Charlie's family, feelings, triumphs and disappointments. Charlie is a great writer even though he's so young, so his words flow across the page like poetry.<br /><br />Though his year gets off to a rough start, things look up when he befriends two seniors, Sam and Patrick. Patrick is openly gay but is in a relationship with a closeted jock and Sam is a bit of a drama queen with whom Charlie falls in love. Through his writings, you get to know a lot about his friends, too, and I felt for them as much as I felt for Charlie.<br /><br />As the year goes on, Charlie's world opens up (he's exposed to drugs and sex and the Rocky Horror Show among other things), but he also has to come to terms with a terrible truth about his beloved late Aunt Helen. I was shocked by the reveal (I won't give anything away here) and wanted to give Charlie a hug.<br /><br />What makes this story so raw and heartbreaking -- and joyous at points -- is that Charlie is such a wonderful character. He's flawed and often makes mistakes, but he's so sweet and caring and truly wants his loved ones to be happy.<br /><br />This book came out in 1999 and takes place in 1991 so it's amusing to read about kids giving each other mixed tapes, but the story itself is timeless. Whether you're an adult who's survived her teen years or are a teen going through them, you'll take something away from this story and will be thinking about it for days.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|As with all the Reacher books,   a great read. I can't wait till the first movie.l can't see Tom Cruie as Reacher, but who knows.
8866130931|5.0|I discovered Moleskine products about 5 years ago, and  I always enjoy the look of the notebook, the quality of the paper, and the resistance.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Well done game. Match 3 games are one of my favorite type of game. Nice twist added to the concept. Graphic are well done. Looks great on my tablet. First match 3 game I have found that didn't force me to play with the tablet held in portrait orientation.  That's a big plus in my book. Happy to have gotten as the FAOTD.

B00526ZKYS|5.0|I love unique YA books like [[ASIN:B009NNXUJI Revenge Of A Band Geek Gone Bad]] and [[ASIN:0547995660 The Giver (Giver Quartet)]]. DELIRIUM was unlike anything I've ever read.<br /><br />Most dystopian novels deal with the government controlling society in some way. Delirium is fascinating because in this case, U.S. citizens are forbidden to feel love. At age 18, teens are actually lobotomized so that they can't feel any extreme attachments to friends, family members, pets .. and of course, a significant other. Instead, people are sent off to live life in an arranged marriage. Everything is decided for them in a way that's creepy and very [[ASIN:157500111X Twilight Zone]]. They're also told that love makes you sick and then die, so everyone literally FEARS love -- something that most of us take for granted.<br /><br />The narrator, Lena, is about to turn 18 and be \\"cured,\\" but ends up meeting and falling for Alex a few months before her birthday. Alex makes her reexamine her beliefs, the government's actions -- even her own family's history. Everything she's ever known is turned upside-down and she's forced to make some very difficult decisions. She's forced to grow up very quickly, which is difficult enough when you're a teen, but even more so when everyone in your life is literally against you.<br /><br />The ending is something of a cliff hanger and the lead-up to it was extremely exciting and suspenseful. Lena turns out to be quite the bad a$$! I cheered out loud for her and prayed that she would make it. This is the first in Oliver's trilogy, so be sure to check out the next book [[ASIN:1444722956 Pandemonium]]

0307474259|4.0|An excellent perspective on the complicated and confusing world of nutrition and dieting. A topic that is fraught with misconceptions and misinformation. The author goes to the crux of the matter and explains in detail how we can be misled into thinking we are eating the right foods, but end up still gaining weight. One should have an open mind when reading this book as it goes against conventional wisdom, much of it perpetrated by so called government guidelines. It's not so much the calories we consume but the amount of carbs in those calories that can ruin any weight control. But I do not entirely agree with the author as he sets out to explain that ALL fruits should be eliminated from the diet. I think that is a tad extreme and after looking up the carb content of berries, for instance, I just don't see how various berries such as raspberries and blueberries would affect the diet and gain weight. But I can certainly concede that many fruits should be avoided, ie bananas<br />A good solid book on changing your eating habits and creating a new lifestyle, based on many principles of Dr Atkins. A definite read
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|It was slow starting and the characters seem disjointed but as the movie progress the characters seemed more believable.<br />By the middle of the movie it came together and was enjoyable after.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|I saw the movie \\"Let Me In\\", not realizing that it was a take off of \\"Let The Right One In\\" I purchased this version to see what the difference was between the two. This version has more depth to it.  Without a doubt, it was EXCELLENT.  It still doesn't take away from the American Version.  I liked them both.  The stars in both films were a credit to their profession, and so young at that to have mastered such talent.<br /><br />This is a different kind of horror film. Its slower moving so that you can become apart of the characters feelings.  It has moments of sensitivity and of course the horrible nature of how a young girl survives.<br /><br />This is not a movie for those who are into the standard vampire movie of blood and gore and action filled.

B002ZG97RE|1.0|I hated the actors who protrayed the terrorists in \\"United 93.\\"  But, after I viewed it several times, I had to tell myself they were actors and I would never see them again.<br /><br />Even though I obtained \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" from Amazon--because Paul Greengrass directed it and I liked Matt Damon's acting--I wasn't interested in seeing \\"The Green Zone.\\"  I didn't know what it was about, but my review of \\"Bloody Sunday\\" touched a raw nerve in another reviewer, so I wanted to let sleeping dogs lie by not seeing \\"The Green Zone\\" at all.<br /><br />Then, Amazon offered a shooting script of \\"United 93\\" and I found out the name of the actor, Patrick St. Esprit, who protrayed Major Kevin Nasypany.  I found out on Amazon that he was in \\"The Green Zone.\\"  That's what made me buy it.<br /><br />Not only was Patrick St. Esprit in \\"The Green Zone,\\" but other \\"United 93\\" alums, opening with the head of the \\"United 93\\" terrorist.  And he had a major role in \\"The Green Zone.\\"  I also saw the actor who menanced the passengers with the \\"bomb\\" on \\"United 93.\\"  Maybe the other two were there in the grainy dark images.<br /><br />But Ben Sliney?  I thought he wasn't an actor.  How did he get cast?  That leads me to: why weren't more of the \\"United 93\\" cast in \\"The Green Zone?\\"  I was disappointed that Patrick St. Esprit didn't have a bigger role.  I thought he would have had a very big role in a war picture.<br /><br />I could also see the template of \\"Bloody Sunday\\" in the \\"The Green Zone.\\"  But this time Director Greengrass' film touched a nerve in me watching Americans kill Americans.  I could watch no more after the helicopter was shot down.  I couldn't get past that scene to watch anymore, so my review might be limited in many ways.
B007THA4FI|1.0|First, let me preface this with I loved the Harry Potter series.  It is hard to believe that this was written by the same author.  This book was a major disappointment to me. I have only stopped reading a couple of novels in my 64 years and this was one of them.  I made it about as far as I could.  Enough said.

B009QW7HMC|4.0|Season 2 forced its viewers to sit through hours of character development and \\"navel-gazing\\". That had to happen at some point in the show. The creators needed us to be invested in the characters. We needed to know everyone of them to fully appreciate what they brought to the dynamic of the show. I thought season 2 did this tactfully, interspersing enough action and death to keep viewers with even the shortest of attention spans coming back for more (of whom I definitely include myself).<br /><br />All of this to say, that this first episode of season 3 puts you right back in the thick of it! Action abounds. The stakes are higher than ever with characters suffering from depression, wounded hearts, and growling stomachs. If all you have are the people around you, people you might hate or people that have failed you, can you still work with them? Can you still be a family? And in light of the character development of season 2, you care enough to see if these questions are answered. Sure its fiction, but the facets of human interpersonal relationships transcend reality and are easily seen in our entertainment, even the most absurd kinds of entertainment.<br /><br />New locations.

B007VTVGAQ|4.0|The keyword in that title is album. This seems to be an album that fans are either loving or hating.  I only wonder how the fans are getting there...<br /><br />If you are a strong fan of Fiona, you probably already own the album, but all I can suggest is to not give up on it too quickly.  Of course, there is no guarantee it will ever grow on you.  This album is not as melodic as her previous albums, but that is more of a comment with regard to pop-like melodies that mainstream listeners of pop, rock, etc are used to.  The jazz fan in me (that has become a favorite genre of mine) finds this album has plenty of melody. It is just something that doesn't become apparent mostly due to some differences in the vocal melody, musical melody, and even some rhythmic differences that remind me of some free jazz musicians of the past. It is a loose analogy, however, so don't expect a jazz album.<br /><br />Now as I mentioned, this work is best when listened as an album, and it really fits nicely as a progression in her catalog, but it stands alone as well.  Reading the reviews there are many comments about the darkness and emotion in this album, and it is there.  But she has also matured in her song writing, and for all the anger that may be there, she knows how to control it, and she definitely shows she's not an entirely depressing person.<br /><br />Put it all together, and you have an album that fits nicely into her catalog.  Fiona has not put out an album that is a part 2 to anything she's every done.  She has evolved a bit with a relatively free approach.  As such, the complex melodies are difficult to grasp on a first listen, and they are leaving many fans with mixed opinions.  I'm sure many fans are forming opinions on a first listen, but if I had to do that I would have given this album 1 star.  It took a half dozen listens for my rating to go up.  Your experience may vary as may your preference. I only want to promote awareness of what this album entails.  If you count on a first listen to form an opinion, then I can only suggest you at least give this one a second.<br /><br />If you are on the fence, then I suggest finding a streaming source.  I'm fairly certain samples on this album won't work.  I don't even think you could download a track or two.  This album works as a unit, and none of the songs really stand out as you'd expect if you are looking for hits.  Perhaps knowing that will be enough to shape a decision on buying it or not.<br /><br />All I know is that Fiona Apple has never been the easiest musician to be into, and she hasn't made it any easier with The Idler Wheel... What I did find is that at least for me, additional chances, and not continually, have given me an appreciation of this album.  I still don't think it is a 5-star effort, but I do feel that it is a 3.5 to 4 star one.  I would guess that many of those who gave it a 1 to 2 star review after one listen would probably also reach a 3 star review with a little time, but as with any music, it boils down to your own opinion.t on a first listen to form an opinion, then I can only suggest you at least give this one a second.<br /><br />If you are on the fence, then I suggest finding a streaming source.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|It took me until after Chapter 9 to get into the first book.  Book 2, I already liked the characters and there was more plot.  I loved the email subject lines/closings, I even went back to read the ones I missed when I realized they were changing. Momentum was already there from end of first book.  Overall, I liked it and bought book three.
B00785P2QC|4.0|fun to play,  nice to be able to put the game down and come back to it.<br />only downfall is it takes awhile to get invest points.<br /> money adds up fast and so does energy.
B008XG1X18|4.0|force closes sometime, and there is some functionality that is missing. Can't change my board if I pin to the wrong one. would like to see that changed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is totally awesome and it keeps u playing for hours to come. It has you hanging on what you should or if your going to die.
B0091CWYQ6|5.0|While the E02i does suffer sonically when compared to it's cousin the E5, for the features it packs, it is a nice update to the FiiO line. It will dual amp and has a few nit picks here in there whilst using it but overal, it is a nice portable device to have with your smartphone. I do not know if it will work with other devices yet. Tell me in the comments on what ones you tried it with. But the controls work very well, it is a very intergrated product for use with a Smartphone and mainly an iPhone 4/4S to be exact doing operations smoothly and nicely. It has some nice bass boosting properties but the biggest point is just how it has a microphone for use in the car while using your favorite headphones as well. There are other things and annoyances and compatibility issues on using sensitive headphones, plugging in the E02i creating a pop(manual says to not have headphones plugged in, but hey, hard to follow) and also the tangly wires. This is not realy just even an amp anymore so I can't say to recommend it to an amp wanter. This is mainly a device for users that wants to be able to use their smartphones(or iPhones at the moment) for many of it's features and should be bought depending on if you want to use it for the voice control, amplification and all the other nice features that I have went through above.<br /><br />If you are looking for this as just an amp than look elsewhere. For the price, it's amp is a 7/10. Very average, sonically disapointing at times but with a nice bass that can sometimes make up for it. However for it's combined function, it is a 9.5 if not a very good device. It is solidly built and it's functions work seemlessly with the iPhone and Siri. The in line controls, and Mic are done very nicely and the bypass switch that I initially thought was redundant makes a world of difference.<br /><br />Full Review is on head fi
B000GCFO0S|3.0|This movie feels sloppy, the pacing the editing. It's like the director filmed way more than what made it into the final cut and lots of scenes were trimmed, or the editor was given bad direction from the director, or the editor just sucks. The movie is choppy, goes from being slow and drawn out to crammed with content. It seems like a three hour movie or couple of episodes of a show smashed into a two hour slot. Some of the visuals are really good, some not so much. The acting is not great, the story is convoluted and only makes sense in about the last 20 minutes of the movie at which point I felt unmoved since I didn't care about any of the characters. There is no beginning to this movie, it just starts and not much is explained like you are starting the second episode of a tv show having missed the first episode. Just not a very good movie, and yet it's still better than most video game movies. On Blu-Ray it looks really good. Since a lot of the film is dark, the black levels are deep and never murky, most shots are crisp in detail and when color is used, its vibrant and looks really good. The movie looks better than it is, the sequel does look better but I just can't imagine doing more with this series. Christophe Gans did an amazing job with  Brotherhood Of The Wolf and his upcoming Beauty And The Beast should be really good as well. Unfortunately his attempt at a Hollywood film is a bit flaccid and I can only assume those Hollywood Dougs had a big influence on the script and final cut of the film. For a horror film, the only thing that is scary is the terrible story this movie tells and is rivaled only by the flat acting.
1451662432|5.0|This book is an easy read, yet it provides a lot of insight on many things Arnold has done in his life. Love him or hate him Arnold has lead a very impressive life using his intelligence, discipline and dedication. The early chapters which describe Arnold's hard work in so many different areas at once can be very inspirational to anyone that doubts what is truly possible. I still have trouble being able to fathom how he managed to do so much before he was 25 years old which was long before he became a huge movie star. Arnold was quick to discuss his faults and not-so-proud moments as well as his successes in business and life. The book also points out that even someone who is on the top of the world isn't perfect and can make poor decisions like anyone else. For the younger readers he does use some \\"colorful\\" language at times, but in today's world it is nothing kids don't hear at school. My only wish is that Arnold would have written this book 15 years ago and this was his second book discussing the last 15 years.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Generally I do not like matching game, But looking at the reviews and being a Free App of the day I decided to give this game a try. What's there to lose as it free?<br /><br />I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of representation in this game. The graphics is very good and so are the sound. The controls works perfectly on Kindle fire as well as Galaxy tab 10.1<br /><br />The permissions are normal and no unwanted modules seen in the apk<br /><br />Permissions:<br />Storage - modify/delete internal storage contents<br />System Tools - Prevent Kindle from sleeping<br /><br />It is definitely one of the good free app of the day if you love matching 3 games. Grab it while it is free.<br /><br />Four Stars!
0060873175|5.0|I give it 5 stars as a bit of a protest vote..there are enough interesting facts about plants and bugs and all the other creatures that live beneath our feet that we will never see to make it a worthwhile fun read. Would be great for young adults to get them interested in the natural world.Give it a chance because it certainly picks up a quarter of the way or so in.
B008XG1X18|3.0|This app has issues opening on the kindle fire. It force closes about 3 times before it will open. But once it opens it's great.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|What a nice read - I couldn't wait to pick it up and read more.  The story was interesting, and not at all what I expected.  It was quirky, poignant, and uplifting.  Gives me hope for my old age - it's never too late!
B009O5CLZY|5.0|this game is awesome it is just like the one on ipod/phone I recommend it to anyone who has played the one on ipod or phone and has liked it
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Loved the style of Lisa Genova's writing.  One never thinks a person in their 40's or 50's would have Alzheimers...it is somewhat expected in elderly people.  The main character eventually accepts that she has a neurological problem.  She managed to hide her Alzheimers for quite sometime.  The story shows the pain affecting the family and person with the disease. Very moving.
0670023329|5.0|Wow!  This book really gets your attention.  What an amazing and sad story.  I am very happy that half of the profits go to the poor guy who had to endure all of this.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Like Cradle of Rome. Lots of fun. If you like match 3 games, you'll love it. Nice to get it for free.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Im happy this app came out. I am disappointed on how much freezes on my kindle fire. besides that super easy and wonderful app
B006IYFCIM|4.0|This is a very information book on how dishonest our society is. It's not alarming, but sad. However, this book does show positive light that we want to be good people, but just need reminders. The book has a very professional, and comical approach on dishonest people's tendencies. A very fun and interesting read.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|i love it! i can't stop playing! even my 3 yr old wants to play! lol she'll get her chance after I'm done! lol she is a smart cookie and the graphics are amazing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was a great way to end the Trilogy.  Enjoyed reading all of the Fifty Shades.  Could not put the books down, stayed up one night till midnight reading.  I'm glad a friend turned me on to the books.  Laters!!
B007VUA7VO|1.0|well I don't really know if I should get this app<br />at all because I don't want my kindle to shut<br />down.But I also want to get this app so I'm just confused!!!!!!!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Very good movie but it assumes that you know quite a bit about the characters. Watch all of the previous movies prior.
0525953728|5.0|This is a gripping story about the special op team that was tasked with the mission that killed UBL (Usama Bin Laden - Osama Bin Laden).  It gives a great background of the author's experience on joining the Green Team and getting the special training that allowed him to join the Navy's exclusive special ops team: SEAL Team Six.<br /><br />The author's goal is not to spill secrets (there is no secret information to be had in this book and he makes it clear from the beginning) but more importantly to get the story straight.  For a story that had been kept Top-Secret for months the team comes to discover that details of the mission begin to hit the airwaves within hours.  Dumbfounded by the amount of misinformation, the author shares the true story.<br /><br />I saw a \\"60 Minutes\\" feature piece about this book and it piqued my curiosity.  I wanted to know the truth.  Love him or hate him for sharing the story in \\"No Easy Day\\", you will have to respect this former Navy SEAL for wanting to set the record straight and honor his fellow team mates.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks this book may have been written as a political stunt or for monetary gains off of the sale of it's proceeds will also be disappointed.  It's clear at some points that the Team members respect the current President because he is their Commander in Chief but they do not particularly like him ... nor do they want him taking credit for a job that they did and leveraging it for re-election.<br /><br />Eye-opening and graphic ... a true military drama / war story with all the gore you need.  If you don't want to know how Osama was killed (graphically), this might not be your cup of tea.  On the other hand, if you want to know what it's like to be a Navy Special Ops guy and read a great autobiography of a Navy SEAL Team Six member ... it's a great read.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Accurate and easy to understand, the weekly forecast helps me plan out my clothing and activities for the week. I recommend this app.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|so far this is a fun game. forward, backward, and jump, plus you gather pinecones to throw. it crashed once so far on my kindle fire, but other than that no complaints!
B0056K4VRM|5.0|If you are even considering buying this, just go ahead and get it. I have loved Mozart and Walter for years, and the insight of the latter into the former is nothing short of magical. Walter, as always, and particularly in his last years, when most of these stereo recordings were made, always illuminates the mystical in the music in a unique way. He has an uncanny ability to inspire his orchestra - regardless of which orchestra it is - to share in his own deeply committed vision of what he sees as the music's message, and the dividends are especially great in Mozart's last three symphonies, as well as the requiem.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this incredibly cheap collection, though I suggest supplementing it with [[ASIN:B0013AWVEE Mozart: Symphonies 39, 40 & 41 \\"Jupiter\\"]], which are Walter's earlier mono takes of these late symphonies. While the stereo versions included in the set under discussion emanate a mysterious autumnal relation to the otherworldly, the earlier accounts feature more robust playing and a more intimately familiar response from Walter's own longtime orchestra, the NY Philharmonic.<br /><br />That having being said, I recommend this set without reservation.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|When the series \\"24\\" ended, I was completely lost!  To my delight, along comes Homeland - written in collaboration by Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa (the genius behind the series \\"24\\").  This pairing is able to create a gripping, edge of your seat drama that will keep viewers coming back.  With the skill of taking pieces of history and making it into a thriller drama for TV, we are introduced to 3 main characters who work with and against each other.  The personal dynamic is fascinating and Claire Danes plays a Bi-Polar, manic-ridden CIA agent.  Determined and completely consumed, she goes after her nemesis a US Marine POW (Brody) who has supposedly \\"turned\\" and could be working for terrorists.<br /><br />It's a gripping show that had me from the first episode.  My first exposure to Homeland was on a Sunday where I watched them as a marathon.  It was impossible to stop (much like \\"24\\").  We are now just in to Season 2 and the twists and turns are already beginning.<br /><br />The acting on this show is awesome and convincing.  Claire Danes' acting is mind-boggling!  There is a reason this show won the \\"Best Drama of 2012\\" at the Emmy's ... even beating out \\"Mad Men\\".  It's THAT good.<br /><br />Can't tout it enough!
B0098VYKSA|5.0|As a fan of fairy tales and myths, the movie was an adult version of the story. This darker version was interesting and entertaining and I would recommend this to any fan who enjoyed the Snow White tale as a child.
B008VBYN80|3.0|its a pretty good game as far as I can tell right now. cant wait to find out more about it
B009QW7HMC|5.0|I watch it online last night with some of the other online AMC FANS and I was blown away with all of the action. Lori is 9 months pregnant already, and Carl is taking charge already Hershely get's bit omg. How is he gonna deliver Lori's baby Andrea is sick. This season will be a force to be recking with. (watch it)
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I finished reading this novel 7AM this morning. I was actually a bit late for work, so you can infer that I did not want to put it down until I reached the end.<br /><br />I am probably in the minority but I am not a fan of Stephen King horror. Oh, he is absolutely talented at writing horror (The Shining scared the bejesus out of me, and I avoided hedges for months!) but it is the non-horror, stories like The Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile, that really shine for me. And this book outshined them all. It is the hope in these books and stories that I have come to rely on, and this book delivered that hope, as well.<br /><br />The novel had a fantastical base - time travel - but mostly it was about people, good and bad and simply evil, and how each person's life affects every other, and the world in general. Not an original premise, for certain, but treated here so well that you almost feel you're seeing it for the first time.<br /><br />Mr King writes with a sure hand. The words are comforting. He uses references you know. There are no 47 letter words used just to impress you (actually, writing like that tends to irritate me - if I want to learn new words, I'll read the dictionary) but he also doesn't talk down to the reader. Another reviewer put it quite right -- it is mature. The prose flowed over me like warm water in the shower.<br /><br />I was 8 months old when JFK was shot. I remember hearing my Mom tell stories of that day when we would see footage on TV during an anniversary of the shooting, how she was on Fifth Avenue in Brooklyn buying Christmas cards. So I didn't really live through Camelot but I lived through the aftermath of its destruction. But I can still appreciate the impact (just as those of us who lived through 9/11 in such close proximity can appreciate the impact of any national tragedy) and that led to a major appreciation of this book.<br /><br />Each chapter built upon the last, creating a driving force to move forward through the pages. Each chapter made me want to read the next and the next, like an inexorable wave. I'm not afraid to say (without any spoilers) that the end brought tears to my eyes. It was sad but eminently fitting.<br /><br />I enjoyed the novel from beginning to end. I hope you will as well.
B008XG1X18|5.0|LOVING THIS. ONLY PROBLEM IS ONCE YOUR ON YOU CANT GET OFF. IT IS FAST AND EASY TO MANAGE THRU. WORTH GETTING!!!!

B006Z7NTCI|5.0|Love this CD. I'm not much of a reviewer, but I know I can put this on and drift away pretty easily.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is sooooooo much better than block story,but if you like survival better than creative than block story might be better.I like creative better than survival,but I also think $7.00 is a little much.
B004BSFC46|5.0|I've had these for my now 5 month old for a couple of months and we have been happy with them.  We started with them when she was about 3 months old and just starting to find her hands and she was fascinated by the colors and noise.  As she started teething, she loves to suck and gnaw on them (it sounds pretty funny, actually) and I love that I can just throw them in the wash, though I do use a delicates bag and air dry to minimize wear on them.  Unlike a couple other reviewers, I have had no trouble with getting them on my daughter or having them stay on and shes been running about 50% on the growth charts.  Maybe if your little one has large wrists? Anyway, I think they have been money well spent!

B008PZ69T8|4.0|I liked this a lot and also gave one as a gift.  Most of the pieces on the album were great, but a few were annoying.
1476712042|3.0|I'm am totally conflicted on how to rate this book, because big chunks frustrated the hell out of me, while other areas I liked. Hence, the rating of 3, smack bang in the middle of scratch my head territory.<br /><br />So, I'll go through the good and the bad, alternating between the two:<br /><br />I don't tend to read books like this, in fact this might be my first New Adult Romance full stop. But I love paranormal romance, so I thought it was just a side step, something I'd enjoy. And I did sort of, but I think my main problem that held me back from really liking it (and it's a major one) was the character of Abby. She FRUSTRATED the hell out of me! I didn't like her at all, because I thought she was being mean to Travis a lot, and was quite selfish, leading him on constantly. Okay, it was fine for her to reject him at the beginning because of his rep, I get that, but when she finally got with him the drama after that was annoying. For ages it was like, she was SO great, he just had to chase her around everywhere (I didn't see why she was great, especially since she treated him badly), and when something went wrong it was always Travis's fault. Like the time she dumps him and then goes to his place to get something with America, and he walks in with a girl and she is mad at him! Like WTF? And America blows up at him and his cousin, again WTF? They had absolutely no empathy for the poor guy. He was dumped, he was moving on, but no, he had to abstain from sex because her royal highness hadn't given him permission to move on, but oh, she was allowed to do what she wanted. And another thing that really bugged me was when Travis beat up Chris with Abby's permission, because her \\"virtue\\" was denounced. And not with one punch, but quite a lot, yet when Travis punches another guy once and Abby gets the guy's blood on her she goes apeshit at him. Again, WTF? So, he isn't allowed to hit someone unless she gives him her royal decree? Another thing I couldn't stand about Abby, was that she was so judgmental of him (and others), going through a good section of the story feeling like Travis wasn't good enough for her, treating him like a whipping boy, and that he was just everything wrong, whereas she was the one who was wrong in my opinion. So, you can clearly see I didn't like her.<br /><br />Okay, now to Travis. I liked and understood him better, but he did go over the top with his violence, like WAY over the top when he beat up Chris just for a verbal slight on Abby's \\"virtue\\". I have been punched before (karate) and have seen guys go down for a lot less punching than what Travis did to Chris, and I believe the type of punching that Travis was doing (or more like committing) could've caused serious damage, yet no one helped Chris, no one phoned the cops or the authorities, and that was it, once the beating had finished there were no more consequences and Chris's role in the story was done. It really seemed incredibly over the top, unrealistic and contrived. Travis was generally an over the top character, but as said before, I didn't mind him mostly, and Abby did drive him nuts. God only knew why he wanted her, probably because she kept telling him no and he wasn't used to that, since every girl on campus threw themselves at him.<br /><br />Now to take a long breath, before the next lot................ Done. Now, I'll state some parts that I liked. The fight club scenes. I found those interesting, plus the drama with the creep pushing Abby against the wall, and the Vegas scenes. With the Vegas part in the story, that was one time that I could understand Abby's frustration with Travis, because he wouldn't listen, but still, she seemed to drop him way too easily and he didn't realise the seriousness of the situation. And the way America dropped Shepley too was way too easy. The women could be stone-cold bitches in this book. But I digress, overall America was fine, it was only one tiny section in the book that really annoyed me about her.<br /><br />The plot, I mostly liked this. At times I lost interest, but then the author threw in some things that I didn't predict, like Vegas. My interest perked up greatly at these spikes in the plot, and I did enjoy those parts. Also, the fire scene was thrilling, and had me really worried for one of the minor characters, because of his connection to Travis. I'm glad with how the author portrayed this bit. And the ending, some say it's to sugary and wraps things up with a pretty bow, all nice and tidy, but actually, I liked that she did this, it gave the book a nice clean ending, and I did want a happy one. So, all sweet on that frontier. Additionally, I liked Travis's family scenes, giving the reader a bit of background on him, and I liked his determination to get Abby back (whipping boy! and again, why dude, why?), but it made for interesting drama.<br /><br />Some people criticise the toxic relationship between Abby and Travis, but despite their character flaws, I didn't mind this part, because that's what the story was about. Plus, who wants to read a romance story where there isn't drama and it's all romance and flowers: I don't! So, no criticism on that.<br /><br />On a minor note, the writing style did leave me a little jumpy, and scratching my head at times. Overall it was okay, fine, and easy to read, but occasionally it jumped from one place to another without a transitional phase. Like, Abby was in one place then suddenly she's outside, and I'm wondering, what the hell, I thought she was over there, so I go back and re-read the part and yup, she was over there. We really need to be told that she's actually got up and left. This happened more than a few times, but not always, so just be prepared that occasionally the characters will move like Usain Bolt between settings.<br /><br />I'm going to round off now, and having looked over my review. Looks like I have a good amount of criticisms, but I wouldn't say to not read the book, because I did like parts, and I did finish the book, just was confused as to whether I liked it or not. Guess I'm sitting on the fence like with religion. My brain (and education) tells me it's illogical to believe, but my superstitions say you have to or your going to buuuuurn, lol. Just joking. But Beautiful Disaster was sort of like this, my brain was telling me this was something I really shouldn't like, and it had so many faults, mainly me not liking the main character, but the plot kept my interest, and stopped me from giving this book a lower mark. So, yeah, 3 is adequate for me.<br /><br />Would I read Travis's point of view with walking Disaster. Maybe, it might be interesting, although the only problem (and a major one) is that I know the plot and that was the main part I liked. But then again, looking into a guy's brain can be fascinating and I might get to understand why he went overboard at times. I'll see, maybe if it's on special, like when I got Beautiful Disaster.<br /><br />So, would I recommend this. Not sure. I think younger people will like it more than older readers, who have more of an understanding on life situations (though, not always true, depending on the person). For me, if I was younger I might not have been as critical, so it's purely a subjective thing. You either like it or you don't, and if you're like me, you're not sure :)r.<br /><br />The plot, I mostly liked this.

B009329Y30|4.0|Good movie. The movie had a great story line and characters that are identifiable. It kept me entertained and engrossed.
B008220C92|3.0|It's competently made, with incredibly unsettling music by Christopher Young, but I can't see myself ever watching this movie more than once. I'm not particularly scared of ghost children, and there wasn't enough of the Ghoul (the main selling point in the advertisements). I'm glad the movie doesn't completely rely on cheap jump-scares, and actually builds creepy tension throughout, but the surprise ending sorta ruined the whole movie for me.
B0087HT36U|5.0|It is angry birds without the slingshot.  It allows you to focus on the structure. There is less challenge in hitting what you are aiming at.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|While many agree that the post-synth era of ZZ Top is better but still not as good as the 70s, I'm not so sure.  I think Rhythmeen is way at the top of their list.  I prefer Billy Gibbon's guitar work in this era.  It always astounded me.  Anyway, that post-synth era has now probably drawn to a close with Mescalero.<br /><br />La Futura definately retains the best parts of post-80s-era Billy Gibbons' \\"fuzzy guitar\\" but also reverts back to the amazing work that ZZ Top did in the 70s.<br /><br />I'm not sure how people cannot readily agree that Billy Gibbons is the greatest American guitar player ever.  This album continues to demonstrate that.<br /><br />The songwriting is top notch and the album is concise, not the rambling overload of songs that was Mescalero.<br /><br />Production by Rick Rubin continues to astound.  He knows how to capture the best elements of band.  From Billy's vocals (like charcoal from the BBQ pit) to Dusty's bass rumbling in your gut, to Frank's amazing drumming tying the trio together, it's all there clearer than ever before.  Is there anything he can't do?  This album is genius and he is a genius too.  It's instantly saddening to realize that he will move on to someone else now.<br /><br />Regardless, I continue to look forward to what la futura holds for ZZ Top.<br /><br />One question remains . . . where is obligatory Dusty vocal?<br /><br />Long live ZZ Top.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Couldn't put it down...a great twist near the end. Scary, creepy, sad, thought provoking. Great entertainment! I will definitely check out this authors other books!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is to addictive to have. I have been playing it for two weeks now and love it. pop ups are the only downfall.
B009AJDDQU|2.0|Great effects.  Doesn't live up to the hype either in the mags or other media.<br /><br />I watched it twice.  Just in case I missed something important.  I didn't.<br /><br />Story disjointed.  Often I am thinking don't open the basement door and walk downstairs.  But they do. REALLY there is nothing scary about it unless you have not seen something coming out of ones mouth, chest or abdomen in other movies.<br /><br />The opening scene on \\"Earth\\".  Needs a bit more explanation. He opens up a can of poison and drinks it.  He dies.  The end. Rush week on planet X! I would think futuristic people capable enough to do DNA engineering would have rudiments of the scientific method down. But then again, alot of discovery's have been made when the scientist uses himself as a Guinea pig.<br /><br />Then the other part of the movie starts.<br /><br />It was so bad I don't even care to see the sequel when it comes out. Because this one did not interest me.

B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Wow...kinda funny how many good reviews happen when a game has very basic permissions! Hmmm....wonder why? Nice little match 3 game with non intrusive permissions. I always liked these games for the quick play.
0307477401|4.0|I have so enjoyed getting to know this detective. He is so human and far from perfect. I think this is the last book of the series. His ending is so sad, that I feel I have lost a friend. How is illness was illustrated was so realistic. I felt I was living it out with him. Great memorable book.
B00846REIS|1.0|I am not one to write reviews, but I felt the need too for this rip off of a book.<br /> Yes I read 50 shades and it was ok, so when I read a few reviews \\" If you liked 50 shades you will love this book\\" and so on, I felt the tug to read it. I got to page 2 and started rolling my eyes. Right from the start it was so close (as in almost word for word close) to 50 shades. Afer 3 chapters I have deleated the book! If I wanted to read 50 shades again I would have. I really expected something close to 50, but not this close. Perhaps if you have not read 50 shades you might enjoy this book because the only positive thing I will say about it is that the writing is a little better, but I had a really hard time getting past the similarities to enjoy it.
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|I've watched all the episodes, and couldn't wait to see this new one! WOW! What a start to a sweet season full of awesomeness!
B008XG1X18|4.0|the pinterest app is so so so awesome. I love pinterest. it is very very very easy to navigate site!
0345803485|1.0|What else is there to say?? This is the worst book ever written, period. I love to read a variety of different genres of books, and I am open-minded to the subject matter of this book- but Oh my Lord this was just beyond horrible, and I could not finish it. I tried SO HARD, but it was impossible. The characters are so unreal that it is hilarious, there is no plot, and it is ridiculously redundant. This woman is a genius- she figured out how to write just one page of words, and then scramble all those words around 500+ times in a row, and then somehow find brain dead editors and publishers to print this steaming pile of crap.<br />Not to speak ill of my good friends who suggested this, but it dawned on me too late that those people that I know that loved this book coincidentally were all the friends that do not read for pleasure normally. I believe that, to them, this was a really good book- because they have nothing to compare it to other that articles from US Weekly . I am thinking that this very well be the case with a lot of these extremely positive reviews, too. Just a thought....<br /><br />But, anyway, if you don't want to feel your soul slowly die, avoid this book.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|I read this book on a recommendation, and while I felt that it's pacing was a bit off; the story on the whole was quite good!  A large cast of characters, and interesting lead and an amazing dog.  What more could you want?  Definitely a lot of fun.
B00932IHGK|5.0|The show is really riveting, disturbing, and have been enjoying the first 4 episodes.  Many twists and many turns, very well done, and I do love all the characters.
0345803507|5.0|This book was well worth the money I paid for it! I bought it used and it looked brand new straight out of the bookstore when I received it.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I was exhausted after reading this book.  One minute they're perfect, the next they're a wreck.  I will still say it's a page turner and it did not stop me from being wrapped up in Gideon and Eva's love story.  Still lots of secrets to learn.  Looking forward to the next book!
B000OBYLVO|5.0|Great romantic comedy with wonderful chemistry.  One of my favorite movies and made me a fan of Jude Law and Cameron Diaz!
B00913DPW2|4.0|This is one of the best hidden object/puzzle games for kindle fire hd. I found it to be a real challenge because you have to unlock things in order to continue. For example, I couldn't pick up certain things until I found puzzle pieces. I am far from an expert at these games, so sometimes it was difficult to know what to do next.
B003Y8YXFS|5.0|IMAGINE is the best album ever created by the best song writer who ever lived. John Lennon left us too soon. We will never know what other great albums he would have created.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is by far one of the. best games out there. It has excellant graphics. I like slot games and usually play those because the three in a row games seem pointless, but this game has different levels and playing fields. For the free app of the day it is the best value. that amazon. ever had.

B004R8HPZY|5.0|Really sweet recording that has so many influences and, for sure, will appeal to a very broad group of folks out there beyond World Music lovers. Traces of the Grateful Dead/Jerry Garcia reeled me in and his unique background only made the journey more interesting. A MUST For anyone interested in going on a musical journey.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This mystery would make an excellent Hitchcock film if the Master were still around to direct it.  It is filled with fascinating and very troubled characters, and takes turns you will not expect.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is amazing. it very addicting. I no problems on my kindle. you earn things without having to buy anything.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|This is a decent alien type movie and is worth watching once.  At the end of the movie I was still waiting for answers to several plot ideas that never came.<br /><br />Why 4 stars?  I would rate this 3 stars at best for the plot and lack of answers at the end.  However watching this in 3D was an amazing experience and deserves 5+ stars.  This is by far the best use of 3D that I have seen.  Every scene looks great and has real depth through the entire movie.<br /><br />I will watch over and over again just based on how well the 3D was done.
B008N1V11U|3.0|The movie was phenomenal, but the game is not very good. Below I have a list of the Good and Bad of this game:<br /><br />GOOD<br />-The graphics are pretty good.<br />-There are different unique fighting styles<br />-The gameplay is pretty impressive<br />-It's open-world<br />-You get to drive the batpod<br /><br />BAD<br />-You have to purchase the batpod with real money<br />-You have to buy BATARANGS with REAL MONEY!!!!<br />-The missions are boring<br />-Controls are a little weird<br />-You have to use real money to buy equiptment even though you already paid SEVEN DOLLARS for the game!!!<br />-Is barely based off the movie<br />  -they mess around with the best lines in the movie and they make them sound stupid.<br /><br />Overall, I was pretty dissapointed with this game. If you purchased this when it was only 25 cents, keep it, but if you are thinking about buying it now when its back $7, do not buy this. It is waste of money. Just buy N.O.V.A. 3.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I love Ellen Degeneres on tv.  Somehow, the antics, dancing and quirkiness are not captured in the written word,but the book is good for a chuckle here and there.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Nicely written giving you the story of the Seals and background training interspersed through the book.  The book gives up NO secrets to our warfare.  A good read. If you like this book try 100 Feet Over Hell, the store of the forward air controllers during the VetNam war.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a great for a fun little piece of entertainment. truly entertaining and addicting. simple and easy to follow.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My grandson played this game almost straight thru until he finished. He loved it. Wish it was longer and had more levels but overall good game.
B005K01VZS|3.0|This is a warm & fuzzy recounting of two very different lives.  I wouldn't call it inspiring, but it was enjoyable.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book.  Very entertaining.   Keeps your attention. I  can‘t wait to read the next book.  Highly recommended.
1439190275|4.0|I first heard about low-carbohydrate eating by reading Gary Taubes's \\"Why We Get Fat\\". His argument for low-carb eating was excellent and I started looking around for more on the subject. Very shortly, I found \\"The New Atkins for a New You\\". It was exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />Where Taubes's book discussed the history and science behind low-carb eating, \\"New Atkins\\" was a step by step plan ready for me to implement in my daily life. That's not to say this book doesn't talk about the science/historical background, just that it has a different focus.<br /><br />If you're looking for a step by step plan, this is the book for you. For an even further in-depth discussion of the science behind Atkins, I would suggest \\"The Art and Science of Low-Carbohydrate Living\\". It is written by the same authors and is both incredibly detailed in its discussion as well as being quite readable by a non-scientist.
1582701709|4.0|\\"The Secret\\" came onto the shelves (and screen) at just the right time. It is the perfect combination of spiritual ideas and practices to get your started on your path to enlightenment... especially if you are just getting started. There are a bunch of 1-2* reviews saying how it over-reaches, under delivers, etc., but that is only true for those whose spiritual journey is already underway. In short, if you are just getting into the idea of spirituality, you SHOULD read this book along with [[ASIN:0985923202 something like God: Six Weeks to Spirituality]].
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|interesting game with beautiful graphics. just enough of a story to tie it together. can not beat the price point!
B00005B1W5|4.0|One thing you can't say about Yanni's music is it all sounds the same like it did in his earlier years. The old phrase that you hear one Yanni song, you've heard them all simply doesn't apply anymore. These pair of concerts done at the Taj Mahal and the Forbidden City were Yanni's follow-ups after the landmark performance at the Acropolis in his native country Greece four years earlier. But instead of doing the same ole-same ole bit, he expands his sound considerably focusing more on vocals, wind instruments and harder tribal sounding percussion.<br /><br />Aside bringing in his usual band and orchestral lineup including superstar violinist Karen Briggs, we also have reknowned Venezuelen flautist Pedro Eustache (who owns 600 wind instruments from around the world!), vocalists Vann Johnson, Alfreda Gerald, Jeanette Clinger and Catte Adams. We also get guitarist from Peru Ramon Stagnaro, which is somewhat rare for Yanni to use guitar in his music. This kind of lineup brings quite a different sound from his previous endeavors. The opening number Deliverence is an epic piece that just about showcases everybody and is an absolute WOW!<br /><br />The performances are bandied back and forth between the two concerts giving different backgrounds to them. One of the highlights is a song inspired by the famous bird called Nightingale that he dedicates to the people of China spotlighting Pedro using a very high register flute. The final number is a dance song called Niki Nana (We Are One) starting off with David Hudson decked out in an Aboriginal get up playing the didjeridu and puts on a rather humorous dance routine with Alfreda. The rest of the songs incorporate a wide variety of genres like jazz, classical, Latin and spiritual among others. My only disappointment as a former drummer myself is the absense of Yanni regular the stellar Charlie Adams, but Joel Taylor here does a good enough job.<br /><br />The DVD itself is certainly a step up from the poorly mixed Acropolis DVD that has a 5.1 mix that would make you cringe (see my review). Here the surrounds are well balanced but only serve for ambient effect which is fine, but you won't experience any real surround effects. Picture quality is about as good as can be with standard definition. Will there be any upgrades to Blu-ray with these two DVDs? Maybe, I don't think there would be much improvement with the video end of these concerts given the source definition. But the sound can be certainly improved upon and certainly needed for Acropolis.<br /><br />To say Yanni's music is diversified would be an understatement, especially now when his musicians are from almost a dozen different countries. Today, Yanni continues to explore with new sounds, styles and different instruments bringing in more edgier music. No longer the Muzak New Age label he used to revile and is now truly a World Music artist or Contemporary Instrumentalist as he likes to refer to himself. Keep on searching and discovering, Yanni!
1439102813|5.0|I've never been close to anyone with Alzheimer's and was NOT looking forward to reading this book on my book club list -- but I loved it! A wonderful surprise! I expected touchy-feely-sappy-sentimentality, but it is not like that at all. The author writes in a very sensible, matter of fact, intelligent voice that quickly captured my attention. And next thing I knew, I was in tears! It isn't written in an overly sentimental voice, but I was deeply moved by this story. I was crying on an airplane! I highly recommend this book to anyone who has a heart.
B0091REZMW|4.0|love it just wish energy would refill faster other wise its awesome. I'm totally addicted. play as much as I can
B008NR8YTQ|4.0|First of all, I like to respond to people who knock Gary Moore, on the basis of his Hard rock leanings, or indeed that he was \\"Not bluesy enough\\". Surprise Surprise, did we forget about Jimi? Was he ever anything less than that,surely not. Of course Jimi's absolute genius was also Funky, and spaced out.He was everything except country and pure Jazz, yet we know he deeply admired Stephen Stills and Clarence White, whilst as a child sneaked into Buddy Guy's gigs. Just imagine Little Jimi sitting before the young and mighty whirlwind Buddy and learning so much, absorbing all he could when he did not even know how to play at all.Buddy has also fulfilled every wish we could have of one the greatest exponents of electric blues.<br /><br />Gary Moore's fascination with guitar is similar to Jimi's but a world away in Ireland.Perhaps not so far in spiritual terms and whilst exposed to a more restricted songlist, he learn't that very well. Indeed well enough to be considered as one of the 5 or 10 greatest hard rock players ever, and in a space and time where there were hundreds of thousands of fantastic musicians.Gary's unimpeachable brilliance, awesome physical power so admired far and wide earn't him the respect of guitarists everywhere.You could see it,feel it,HEAR it. This was no featherweight touch with a flexi plectrum on light strings, this was awesome physical power and it sounded like Charles Atlas on the guitar.Gary's vast reserves of technical ability, accuracy and a special, Irish melodic gift that sprinkled his riffs with dangerous intent and solos with a melodic beauty so few Hard Rock guitarists have.Perhaps only SRV and Steve Morse have the same absolute physical strength, and sounded like they do.<br /><br />He moves to the blues and before our eyes trims it all away, so only the sparse structure remains.Penetrating and succinct solos with a haunted voice.Here we see Gary redefining his view of everything. He became blues, he lived it daily, helping people and never being brash or tacky with his wealth. He remembered who he was and were he came from. A musician's musician, and loved by so many punters. Like Rory, so deeply missed.<br /><br />How lucky are we to hear Gary playing Jimi's music with the originals, as they know how it should sound. Here Gary knows he must invariably play not just with power but with an Angelic touch and dig deep to get the Funk down man as Jimi does.It sounds fantastic and we miss you Gary, Mitch and Billy.
B002XZOZQA|5.0|This movie is such a classic. Music is great and<br /> seeing Michael Douglas at such a young age is an added bonus!  The dancing is terrific and it also has a tender love story that unfolds through out the movie.
B007XNAPNY|5.0|I absolutely love this video.  The Blu-ray disc produces a beautiful picture and the sound quality is excellent.  The only way to improve it would be to be at the concert in person.  I also like the way it was filmed - I enjoyed seeing the interactions between band members through different camera angles.  Highly recommend.
B0086700CM|4.0|love the way the main character looks like he is really running.  very real looking.  game is hard but doable.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|This album is rich and inspiring, love the music, songs and sound. Mumford and Sons is a true folk/alternative band with a deep resonating, understanding of their relationship to the Father.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|It has a story and a challenge. This is a fun game and plays well on my Kindle  Fire. Grafics and colors are fantastic. You will enjoy this game.
B0053O89RY|5.0|GET GET GET GET IT YOU WILL LAUGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH SO MUCH SO MUCH FUN GET IT. I LOVE THEM ALL AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM ON TALK SHOWS  THAT HAVE THEM ON THEY ARE SO NICE SO SWEET.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This is a great book, that i believe everytime you read you while find a new meaning to it. It is beautifully written, and has amazing one liners. It doesn't try too hard to be something, it just is. I think anyone reading this book would really enjoy it, so i highly recommend it!
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I remember watching the black and white Dark Shadows TV shows after school when I was young. Not too many programs can create such lasting memories as this one did. Yes it was campy and over the top BUT enough to be interesting and enjoyable!  I loved Angelique as she created so many problems for the Collins family and poor Barnabus. Johnny Depp does a FANTASTIC job as Barnabus Collins, he remains dead faced but uses his eyes and body language to create a wonderful believable vampire character. I will not go into all the details as others have, but believe me it is NOT a waste of money to get this DVD or Blue Ray. No you will not see Gore and excess vampire violence, Like the TV show, it tunes into the Family characters and issues they face. Mine you their issues are a bit different than most families, Vampires, Werewolves, Witches wanting to destroy you. But they do knit it all together nicely . The music was a great ride for anyone over 40, some very memorable songs which fit right in with the 60-70s theme. The fact that so many stars agreed to be in such a movie is a testimony to the Original TV casts creating this unforgetable story line. the ONLY thing I wish Tim Burton did was not FLASH the 4 Original TV characters on screen. They should have had at least a minute or two to converse with Barnabus, if only to say hello and thank you for inviting us to your grand party. It was VERY cool to see the Origninal Angelique, Barnabus, Maggie Evans and Quintin Actors on screen with the NEW Barnabus johnny Deep. i do hope that they do a sequel, It was a blast seeing this fun flim.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Good book...enjoyed reading it... liked the fact that it was not easy to figure out. Plot thickens as you go along!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have this Agamemnon on my PC, and was surprised to find it on the amazon market.I first bought the free version and compleated it quickly. Today I saw it as the FAOTD, and was overjoyed.It was worth it and I would pay full price.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|Kiss fans, although some of the most cynical and negative people on earth, will have no choice but to love this album based on its solid musical framework and incredible rock and roll riffs and enuendos! Paul does an amazing job in producing this record, and the guitars are loud and proud! Each time I listen to the array of songs, it just keeps on getting better and better! The song writing is classic kiss with catchy hooks and melodic solos....proving that they are just as good as they ever were in the 70's, 80's, 90's and so on. It's very refreshing to hear a real rock and roll record with no BS! A must buy for a true fan, or even a new one!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|its fun.  one of the more fun ones ive played.  just remember to use your android keyboard as it doesnt recognize others.

B009QW7HMC|4.0|GREAT episode, so why not 5 stars you ask?! Well I could have done without the \\"Kum ba ya\\" sing-along, as well I threw up a little in my mouth when Carol said the following to Darryl.<br /><br />Carol: \\"Pretty romantic. Wanna screw around?\\"<br /><br />All I say is - run Darryl RUN! We've had enough very bad soap opera drama in season 2, and well, if starts in season 3 then ...<br /><br />Finally, the writers gave the characters some survival skills -- 'bout time!<br /><br />Finally, the women folk are doing more than having sex, cooking, and making iced tea.! Season 2 made these women look like a Muslim's man wet dream [minus the burka]. My mother, grandmother and great-grandmother all knew how use guns and protect themselves, so what took these women so long to man-up. Heck, America was built on guns! Still is!<br /><br />Finally, there are actual zombies during the zombie apocalypse.<br /><br />Finally, Rick has become a true leader.<br /><br />Finally, little Carl is tough, just like the inner city street kids already are in any big city today.<br /><br />Really great episode, REALLY GREAT! Can't wait until next week. I'm hoping the next to be gone from the series is Herchel's other daughter, the useless blonde girl whose best skill is campfire songs. \\"We're surrounded by zombies. What should we do? I know -- let's sing!\\"<br /><br />Note: For anyone who thought the song was appropriate, just pretend like during that scene T-Dog pulled out a boom box and started playing rap music, then ask yourself if you would still feel the same way about the sing-along. Just saying ...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This cute app is so fun and addicting. I still love to drop quarters into this game whenever I'm at a fair or carnival. So to be able to play this on my Kindle Fire is awesome. Try it. You'll be hooked! Nice graphics and sounds. Never freezes.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've been reading fiction for a long time, and while the craft of writing can be learned, the instinct for what makes a good story seems to be just that- instinct.  A good story transcends genre and age groups. A good story is more concerned with my experience as the reader expecting to be entertained than the writer showing off his skill, and at worst insulting me.  Wool etc. is a great story.  Full of twists, surprise endings, sympathetic characters, and a world originally, thoughtfully and credibly imagined. Without hitting me over the head, the metaphor of our earth in its protective silo of atmosphere is well drawn, without bias, or agenda. I was grateful that the storyline actually ended (a trend in disfavor these days it seems), even as I hated to see it end.  I will definitely be reading more Silo stories.

B003TOMAPC|5.0|Although \\"Kick-Ass\\" is undoubtedly goofy in nature, it has a surplus of something that the majority of superhero movies lack- heart. There is one scene, during which the protagonist is engaged in a battle to defend a man who is being attacked by three others. He is outnumbered, outclassed, and clearly in over his head. He takes a wicked beating, yet he refuses to give up, and he sacrifices his body for the sake of defending a stranger. One of the attackers, mystified by the protagonist's seemingly irrational behavior, asks of him, \\"What's wrong with you?\\" The young hero replies (paraphrased), \\"There's three of you picking on one guy. And you're asking what's wrong with ME?\\" This scene, stunning in its ferocity and courage, perfectly captures the heart that \\"Kick-Ass\\" possesses.<br /><br />But let's not forget that this movie is also laugh-out-loud funny, particularly with the absurdities portrayed by the odd little man best known as \\"McLovin\\". Nick Cage's performance is also outstanding, but it's the young Chloe Grace Moretz, who is a force of nature, despite her diminutive size. I suspect (and hope) that she has a very bright future ahead of her.<br /><br />\\"Kick-Ass\\" is not only entertaining and fun, it also gets your heart racing, and stimulates thoughts about surprisingly deep subjects, such as bullying, society's oft questionable values, and the significance of family influences upon one's direction in life.
B007THA4FI|2.0|First book in some time that i haven't finished.  I read at least a book a week and after 6 chapters, i had to move on.  Hard to follow; and just not all that interesting!<br />Amazon Verified Purchase
0307990850|5.0|Lee Child's \\"A Wanted Man\\" is a true page turner. The plot is intricate and full of twists.  I did not need to know all of that, because I'm familiar with Lee Child's other books, and this one is a gem.  The 6'5\\" Jack Reacher is an intriguing character, and never stops proving his brain and brawn work together extremely well.<br />Mr. Child keeps you on your mental toes every page of the book! When I see he has a new book out, I get it or find it as soon as I can.
B00914JWSW|5.0|I've had this album a week and have listened to it several dozen times!  Just eleven songs, but what a collection!  One of the best, in my opinion, is Try to Win a Friend with such inspiring lyric and message and of course Barbra's just right intonation.  Every one of these songs is just perfect.  This is the first album in recent memory of any artist that I find I can just listen right through it without jumping back or forward to find one that stands out above the rest.  They are all just beyond belief.  And there are some cute spoken words between Barbra and musicians/technicians in the studio before nearly each song just for good measure.  IMO, Barbra gets better as she gets older (if that's even possible); she has tremendous range and passion which are evident in everything she puts out.  Once in a lifetime talent; so glad I lived in her lifetime.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|....it needs to be updated to the same level as the phone version. I love playing this game on my Kindle....but I love the 5-9 coin options and badges that the phone version offer.

She is the first artist that I know of that has brought the violin out of the orchestra and into the front-and-center hip hop band.  Her music has done much to make the violin \\"cool\\".  This CD has a full range of music and is well worth purchasing.
B005O745TG|4.0|Season 7 of HIMYM is another season of the typical relationship blunders, to the point that the love mishaps began to feel quite predictable.  This would be an issue if I actually watched HIMYM for that reason.  But I don't - I watch this show because the characters are over-the-top hilarious.<br /><br />In addition to the usual cast, this season also featured a very good appearance by Kal Penn.
184195392X|5.0|An enthralling, heartbreaking, uplifting, wonderful story of religion, faith, and myth. It begins as a colorful exploration and celebration of the characters of life - human and animal; the quirkiness, closeness, and necessity of family and friends, and nature; and the variety of religion and it adherents. All described marvelously through the awed and loving eyes of a young boy. A young boy who then has to make sense of tragic loss and horrible evil. Does religion arise from myth - a way to escape from brute reality? Or are myths only other forms of truth that religion and faith codify as a means to comfort and encourage us to live meaningful, hopeful, and love filled lives in the midst of cruelty and sorrow? It is the great mystery, beautifully explored in this novel.

B007FG9LIE|4.0|Everyone else has said it all.  I really liked Pines. If you like a little bit of mystery with a little bit sci-fi you'll love this book. I didn't see the ending coming!!!  Pretty good twist.

B008NEVP1S|4.0|Okay I admit I'm a complete Aimee addict so am anything but subjective.  So to me having another collection of such superior songwriting and vocals is just more of a very good thing.  But specifically, I think that Labrador and Crazy Town are two of Aimee's best ever.  Like many songs before, they just keep playing over and over in my head.  It irks me that Rolling Stone said \\"nothing new here\\" about Charmer.  More of Aimee's best, even if admittedly it's somewhat similiar in tone to what's come before, doesn't mean it isn't a worthy achievement and doesn't provide substantial increased enjoyment of a great artist.  And how about some recognition for a truly gifted song crafter.  The fact that Aimee can continue to pen lyrics that are memorable and unique, after writing such an incredible catalogue already over her career is really remarkable.  Aimee's a treasure, and Charmer adds to her luster.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I bought this watch 2 months ago, and it works absolutely fine. The size is perfect for a man who doesn't use his car and watch to look him big. (Actually it was quite difficult to get a non oversized watch) I would definitely not wear with a suite cause of the casual design of the band, but I don't wear suit anyways. The only weak point is the band material that will tend to fray... but I think it is still ok, and won't make a real problem. So far I have not had to wind it, everyday usage is enough to keep it go. That's the best watch I have ever had so far!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Loved it! An easy to understand, hard to master time waster. Would encourage other bored people to give it a try.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I read this book expecting it to be just as good as the others. i was not dissapointed. There were some great twists in the story
B0091REZMW|5.0|love it wish it was easyer to get the items needed to trade.beyond that its really fun and addicting.hope the updates continue to go good.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|No, this is NOT a work of literary genius. However the story is good and brings you in... It's not a big BDSM story that everyone made it out to be either. There is a small amount in the stories but not too much.<br />I personally fell in love with the demanding Christian Grey, Ana is a strong woman who I quickly decided was a great female lead.  I read all 3 books in 3 days and then read them again!<br />Give it a chance, dont go in expecting anything (I didn't, I thought it was going to be awful) and take it for what it is- an entertaining, sexy read.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|I must say I am not disappointed! Since I have DISH this is where I come to see the show. Now that prison! Talk about your fixer upper!  I know now that Lori appreciates the man she had, and Rick sees that she is the cause of him fighting with Shane, and the reason for him having to murder him.  And that baby may possibly be Shanes.  It's nice to see Carl being a little man!  Big turn around from being a little brat...and him and Beth are seemingly smitten with each other.  They all look like they need a good shower, that goes to show how intense the apocalypse is.  The day to day struggle for the necessities, things we all take for granted.  Maggie is just as bad ass as Andrea, she's fighting in there with the men.  And Carol is shooting! Yay! Nice to see her being useful outside of the homely home maker duties.  I don't think I saw T Dog in the opening credits still, its season 3, what's up with that?  Is he gone be full of one liners again?  And Oh yea, Daryl and Carol screwing around? Im not suprised if so. Andrea and Michonne, Im eagar to see what happens with them too! But good awesome show, can't wait to see whats ahead.

B009QW7HMC|5.0|It looks like The Walking Dead has really hit its stride with a superbly executed series 3 opener that doesn't waste any time at all. Months have passed since the end of season 2 and our group is short of food, ammo and conversation. All the soap opera squabbles are over, with Rick firmly in charge and everyone - including Carl - going for head shots on anything that moves and murmurs.<br /><br />Season 3 has also upped the zombie body count substantially and there are some inventive new zombie kills too. The comfort (and growing viewer boredom) with the farm is far behind us as the team have retreated into a prison where a whole array of new problems await. The prison promises some excellent twists and surprises for upcoming episodes judging by the trailers.<br /><br />The Walking Dead established itself as one of TV's best shows in the first season, then lost its way a little in the second, but is absolutely back on track. It's grittier, darker and more dangerous than ever before. The only question is -- who's going to get infected next?
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|this app sucks.its so misleading.i thought that it would b like a 1st person game but all u do is find the hidden object. its good enough 4 a free app but dont pay the $1
B00846REIS|3.0|This was a good story and held your interest but,....very much like the 50 Shades.  Yes, there are a few different people with different types of problems but, really?  How many young women go to the big city and meet a very rich and handsome young man under thirty who is very possessive, has psych problems, is also insatiable about sex and also, has a roommate?  Albeit, the roommate is a guy with his own set of problems.  All in all, it was a good read, quick and sassy but too much like 50 Shades.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|I was really looking forward to this movie. Love Charlize Theron and the advertising for the film made it look legendary. What a group of boring, horrible performances. I see many people reviewing this film say,\\"the special effects were fantastic. The actors didn't act but the movie was great.\\" Why would you want to watch a boring movie in which the actors display only slightly more animation than an ordinary person. Kristen Stewart has a grand total of maybe four facial expressions and does not always succeed in placing them in the right order. Chris \\"Thor\\" Hemsworth needs a trip to acting school, as his performance was also a snoozer. The seven dwarfs were not interesting in any way, except to wonder how in the hell they shrunk Bob Hoskins down to such a small size. The director is a first timer who was out of his depth with a story that required more complex writing and better character development. Save your money for better new releases like: The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, which actually has a great cast, a funny story and a director who specializes in creating independent cinema.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I pulled an ab muscle reading this book. Tina Fey is wildly funny and the stories she shares bounce around different topics perfectly. I would highly recommend this book.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with the movie for many reasons, but the movie is a true musical in every sense.  And the music is INCREDIBLE!  I immediately made a purchase!  I've found myself listening over and over and over to these songs, getting lost in their swoon and sweep, which are not only inspiring, but so deeply moving, and so very satisfying musically and emotionally.<br /><br />Glen Hansard is a brilliant song writer.  The songs are poetic, lilting, and drifting at times, and at other times I find them to be very strong and grounded; they are bold and yet very tender.  Then there are tunes that whisk you into an escape of lovely whimsical joy.  There is definitely Irish humor.  I've cried and laughed.  The guitar mixed with the piano and violins are perfect harmonious companions.<br /><br />As for Glen and Marketa, their voices are hugely complimentary in so many ways.  The male/female duo is PERFECT.  Glen's voice has a broad range and it's very strong.  Marketa's voice is sweet and soft; very feminine, and she knows how to harmonize beautifully.  She compliments him very well, and I agree that she tames him in some ways from being too overwhelming; perhaps too loud to be audibly palatable for enjoyable listening. They are lovely together.<br /><br />The songs are absolutely delightful.  I own both CD's (original soundtrack and Broadway musical)-- the original movie soundtrack as seen here in this review, is a more raw acoustic style and is a true following of all the music found in the movie by Glen HYansard and Marketa Iglovia.  The Broadway version is also excellent.  It's richer and fuller in sound because it is more instrumentally complex; there are more stringed instruments (violins, bass, cello, etc.), and there are more voices in chorus. However, the Broadway version is lacking some of the tracks found in the movie. Yet both are truly wonderful, and therefore, I suggest getting both if you are able. If I had to choose between the two, I would choose the original soundtrack to the movie and start there. But the Broadway version is certainly worthy of attention and applause.<br /><br />I am so thankful for this movie that was made and the music as well. What a wonderful breath of fresh air!  Thanks to all the producers, actors, and to Glen and Marketa! Such a beautiful creation you've made! BRILLIANT ARTISTRY!the original soundtrack to the movie and start there.

0062127241|3.0|I finished this book last night, I'm still trying to figure out why I didn't care for it. I'm a big Who/Pete fan, have been since age 14, (40 years ago!) and I had high hopes for this. After all, Pete has long been one of the best and most articulate interview subjects ever, his reviews of his own (and others) work have always been very insightful and (sometimes) humorous. In a nutshell: this book has to cover a lot of ground, 60 plus years, and it feels like big chunks of his life are just skimmed over. Personally, I was hoping to learn more about his approach to his music than hearing about his endless extra-marital affairs and real estate deals. It's just kind of ....ordinary. Too bad.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|This is an awesome movie. daniel radcliff is awesome in this movie. we all know him as harry potter but you just have to get past that in this movie. he did such a good job in this movie. he is going to be a good upcomming actor. this movie was not really scary it was creepy though. i liked the time they set it in. thats when this kind of movies are the best. the scene that got me was the crow flying in the window. that was the only part that made me jump. the creepy part was when dan sees that rocking chair go back and forth back and forth with no one in it. i would of been out of that place and never go back. this was a really good movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B0083EW97W|4.0|I liked John's edgier electric albums but this is a return to the softer acoustic stuff. There's a lot of nice music here along with the top notch musicianship to make this a worthwhile purchase. $5.00 bargain.

B0067TGSOK|5.0|I went in expecting a book about building a business for, well, 100 bucks. I came away with a fresh view on what I do and how it may be valuable to someone. Heck, they might even pay for it!<br /><br />It's hard not to think of all the ways you can build a small business as you read through this book. It's chock full of inspiring stories off all kinds that have a common interest, someone decided to charge money for what they do. The range of business models are interesting. Some client services, some digital goods, and even some physical goods. The bottom line is that it doesn't matter what you do. If you love it and are good at it, you can make a pleasant living doing it.

B00753MBHA|4.0|American audiences probably became familiar with Accept when they released their classic \\"Balls To The Walls\\" album, a metal classic that recounted AC/DC with the title track, but quickly dispelled any accusations of being a tribute band with said album containing stylistic variety that recalled classic European acts of the day, UFO, Judas Priest and Saxon, to name a few.<br />  After a long hiatus, Accept decided to reform, with a new singer and attitude that delivered their toughest album to date, \\"Blood of Nations\\".  The follow-up \\"Stalingrad\\" is sonically quite similar, produced by Andy Sneap, who gives the band a tougher tone that's a must in today's metal music.  The title track is just one gem, the whole album being a fine classic metal outing.  No black metal trappings, death grunting, or blast beats.  It's the metal style that reached dominance in the early and mid 1980's that made thrash possible.  Accept have toured recently with the mighty Kreator, fellow Germans who probably benefit as much from Accept as the old hands do from pairing up with one of Europe's, if not Europe's best thrash band, themselves being around now for going on twenty five years.<br />  It just goes to show that when something isn't broke, don't fix it.  Great solo work, rough but tuneful vocals and strong songs make \\"Stalingrad\\" one of classic metal's best offerings of the year.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|I WAS DISAPPOINTED BY THIS BOOK.  IT WAS NOT UP TO THE WONDERFUL PROSE IN HIS EARLIER BOOKS AND SEEMED FLAT WITH NO FLAVOR.  SHORT SENTENCES AND LACK OF COLOR.  SORRY IT WASN'T WORTH THE KINDLE PRICE.  BARBARA BEKKER
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This app is more than just another match three game. btw I'm running on a Kindle Fire HD. The graphics are crisp and clean. The story is interesting.

1469984202|4.0|Having just finished an absolutely awful book by an established author, The Edge of Nowhere \\"TEoN\\" by Elizabeth George, I found it refreshing to read Hugh Howey's sci fi story, Wool, which came in the same Amazon.com order. I showed my bias when the books arrived, starting in on TEoN (and slogging through to the end) while Wool patiently waited its turn. Days later I began reading the second-string-story, so to speak. The hook was sharp and the plot intriguing, so I raced through the first installment (not realizing when I bought it, or even at this point, what it was), and continued on, riveted, through the penultimate part. By that time I'd snooped the cover, the informational page near the front, and, just before the epilogue, Q&A With Author Hugh Howey, from which I learned: Wool was the first self-published, unedited (editored?) book I'd read, Mr. Howey believes in accountability (encouraging readers to provide reviews, and promising to read them) and the author has a sense of humor to boot, a refreshing change from the situation-with-Ms-George's story. Having become more informed about what I had, I raced through to the end. But about the story (Note: the following paragraph's plot synopsis contains low level, smallish spoilers).<br /><br />Wool is a story in 5 parts, each divided into a number of just-right-in-length chapters. It's Dead Man Walking from page one, the man being Holston, the sheriff of a silo, a gigantic sort of confined structure that exists mostly belowground. The air outside the silo will not sustain life. The leaders use lotteries to control population growth. Couple's that \\"win\\" are allowed to conceive within a certain time span. These take place soon after a resident's death, through natural or unnatural causes. The latter being generally due to a form of capital punishment called \\"cleaning\\" (the reason is revealed early in the story but I won't spoil it), for certain offenses including expressing interest in exiting the silo. Holston, we learn, plans to leave in part in order to join his wife whose corpse rests within sight of the silo's  uppermost section. The story becomes increasingly complicated after Holston's death, as the silo's long time mayor and deputy trek to the bowels of the structure to track down a prospective replacement. Several suspicious deaths follow on the heels of the trip and, as is typical, curious, skeptical characters try to make sense of what happened and why, get caught up in what's-really-going-on, and end up in a battle of good versus evil. Suffice it to say that there is plenty of action, cliffhanger moments galore and even some surprises along the way. My only complaints would be minor, on plot (which was the best part of the book): an overly quick, exceedingly lucky ascent; the existence of certain somebodies without another's knowledge; and okay, the tied up nicely ending. As far as the writing, it's, in two words: absolutely adequate, which is infinitely better than (beating a dead horse here) a certain established author's (afforded the luxury of a book tour while I imagine Mr. Howey hangs out in his house). I didn't find a single sentence to complain about, nor did I feel the need to scribble down anything noteworthy to savor later. In summary, great plot makes this sci-fi story a worthwhile read, which is the best self-published book I've read yet. Better: Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card, His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman, and The Book Thief by Markus Zusak.learn, plans to leave in part in order to join his wife whose corpse rests within sight of the silo's  uppermost section.

1250010489|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  As an aside it was also the first book I bought for my new Kindle.  Seemed like a no brainer!  Being a techno-thriller fan this book did not disappoint.  The technical accuracy that was brought to the story really helped.  It's very irritating to read a book and see big flaws regarding technology that the author obviously has no experience with.  An example is a submarine based book I read awhile back where one of the sailors on the sub was able to use his GPS to keep track of where they were.  Unlikely!  The only bit I found a bit annoying in this book had to do with the editing.  Daryl Haugen's last name kept changing.  At times it was Haugen and other times it was Hagen.  That and, yeah I'm being picky, a couple times the word 'passed' was used when obviously the correct word should have been 'past.'  I'll assume this may have just been an issue in the Kindle version and hopefully not in the hardback.  Still, I would recommend this book to anyone.

Once I saw the movie I had to find out what happened next so i purchased both the 2nd & 3rd book.  Having seen the movie I had a clear picture of the characters and that I loved..  The books came to life for me.  I am 48 yrs old and I could still relate to Catniss. I have my coworkers reading the books now.  they are as addicted as I was.

B0098VXE50|3.0|I rented the movie just for a weekend night with nothing going on. It was probably worth the $3 I paid to rent, but I wouldn't have any desire to see it again. Chris Hemsworth obviously did a fantastic job. Everyone else is so-so. The queen was a little over the top, and everyone bashed on Kristen's performance as Snow White. I honestly did think she was all that bad. Definitely could have had more lines as the lead role, but nothing was bad about her acting. All in all an ok movie with nothing to do. Worth the $3 to rent

B005LAIHY0|3.0|Love Alien and Aliens.  This just didn't do it for me. The FX were cool. The movie just tried to hard to move forward, be cool and intellectual. It seemed forced. Tried too hard to channel the first two alien films.  Won't buy it but will see the sequels.

B0054TK99E|5.0|I bought this HD digital version, season one and two and also ordered from Walmart's, season one on regular DVD ..and I have to tell you, before spending the bucks ,look at the DVD version, I think it's 25 % better but if you're doing it with Kindle Fire or another device, I totally understand the \\"portability\\" of the \\"WOLF\\"..ComicCon was in NYC this past weekend and Jeff(the creator of Teen Wolf\\" and Tyler Posey showed up).....Tyler's MAJOR STAR material now and that's all from this show..he has done other movies, TV but he really shines in this show...so happy they won the 10 million$ lottery to film in LA with tax write-offs...or I guess we would never have seen a season three ..BTW: with TWENTY-FOUR episodes,not 12 per season!!...and also with the DVD(there are THREE discs) you can view each disc straight through and press Play all and it will play all the shows on that disc...Amazon NEEDS to come up with an application that we can do that also if we buy a season because Hulu has it already , so it is NOT a huge KGB Government SECRET:-)...it can be done digitally..I'll look at all my \\"queued\\" shows one after another..you have to set that up in settings...but for me it comes down to the quality of the picture, the sound..and I looked at the Picture settings for the DVD and it's only 450p not 1080 and it's amazing...so I have both, I did not see the second season on DVD but remember ALL shows are available on MTV online, in HD plus I think extra interviews which I avoid at all costs...I don't NEED to know a STORYLINE, SURPRISE ME! I can also connect my iMac by a strange looking cable to my flatscreen and look at it that way too!!..WOLF HEAVEN!THREE ways to view the WOLF!....MTV::: they will take it off soon ,so look at them..and also the extras that are on the DVDs are not on Amazon's HD Digital and I know it's the studio and not Amazon's choosing!<br /><br />Cheers..<br />Tony(NYC)

0525952926|5.0|\\"Winter of the World\\", book two in Ken Follett's Century trilogy was another engrossing page-turner revisiting the families we grew to care about in \\"Fall of Giants\\". I learned more from \\"Fall of Giants\\" because I'd been quite uneducated about the first World War.  \\"Winter of the World\\", concentrating on WWII, didn't reveal new information on the atrocities of the Nazi's or the audacity of the attack on Pearl Harbor, but it did provide the perspectives of Follett's characters as they faced those historic times.<br /><br />The man can sure write an epic! I'm very much looking forward to the third novel about the Cold War which Follett sets up well in \\"Winter of the World\\".<br /><br />In the meantime, for readers who would like to learn more about Stalinist Russia post-WWII, I highly recommend the trilogy by Tom Rob Smith, beginning with the novel \\"Child 44\\".

B004XDYJRU|5.0|Since purchasing TuneIn Radio Pro (only $.99), I deleted similar apps from my tablet and phone.  This one radio app outperforms all the others. It provides access to perhaps thousands of radio stations worldwide, and all genres.  I especially like the ability to setup favorite stations, AND schedule/record station events in advance.  Schedule once and forget it.  Guess what???  By installing TuneIn Radio Pro on my cell, I am able to stay connected to my favorites stations as I drive, i.e., anyplace I go, even out of state.  No need for Sirius/XM radio, Tune-in Radio Pro offers most of the same stations and they are FREE, no monthly billing.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a great match three game. Beautiful design, nice color, good story. I just wish there was a volume control in the options but that's a nitpick especially on a FAOTD. Thank you, Amazon.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|I actually liked Prometheus as a whole. it wasnt the best sci-fi movie ive seen this year, but it was decent, and worth the price i paid for it.  ill tell you this much.. Noomi Rapace stole the show.  if it wasnt for her performance, i probably would have rated this film much lower.  but, she did a great job.  the rest of the cast, even charlize theron which normally does a fantastic job, were kind of lackluster.<br /><br />also, the film lacked that intensity factor.  there was only really a couple of scenes in the whole film which put me at the edge of my seat.  the rest was kind of meh.<br /><br />so yeah, it was a decent film.. one that i will probably watch again.. but i definitely see why the movie got mixed reviews.  its just from my perspective, it wasnt that bad.  but admittedly, Noomi Rapace is the primary reason for me liking the film.  without her performance, i too would have rated this film 2 stars.. maybe lower.
B000SEGSB8|5.0|Tony Judt was not only one of the most compelling writers of our time but almost every word in this densely packed book is worth reading carefully.  In it, he moved the center of what readers had come to think of as Europe well to the east -- so that it really is in the center,  and in many other ways, he looked afresh at the facts and found astounding new stories to tell.  If there is only one book you read about Europe in the 20th century, it should be this one.

0316227706|5.0|This is a must have for any dog lover especially those who have dogs who love water.  Seth has captured the essence of these dogs doing what they love to do.  It is a perspective that is rarely if ever seen; one of pure enjoyment of the game.  A great Christmas gift for that dog lover on your list no matter what type of dog they might have.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|it is very enjoyable and reminds me of the arcade games. I would recommend this one to people of all ages.
B008N5UX9M|2.0|Before I bought this album ..I was not expecting Iron Maiden type sound<br />BUT I definitely not expecting this either..<br />It came across really weak...<br />The vocal let me down and the music was really predictable...<br />I LOVE when bands and////or members of bands experiment with different genres..<br />Yet to me this is all too safe and no guts or glory  (((Cotton Wool))) Type music<br />I really gave it a good go I had it in my car stereo for a good 2 weeks...I just could not get into it<br />without cringing ... Luckily I was able to swap the CD with a mate..<br />Sorry but it was just plain disappointing....<br />I love maiden and to give you an example of band members doing different projects outside their bands...<br />Would be Serj Tankian I LOVE all his solo stuff nothing like SOAD but its still beautiful and honest..<br />British Lion might be honest but not beautiful....
B004XN3FHA|5.0|I ordered & purchased the Fenix TX41 after seeing the flashlight owned by a friend. The older one gets, the more light at night one needs it seems.  This flashlight is extreamly bright and PLEASE don't shine it into anyone eyes if you expect them to ever see again !.  I love that it uses \\"AA\\" batteries and I really don't have any complaints. Please read the instructions !  It states that with the \\"electronic switch\\", there is a slight drain on the batteries even when the flashlight is turned off, BUT if you unscrew the battery cap on the end by a 1/2 turn, this will disconnect the batteries, therefore no drain.  Again, the drain is next to nothing, but if you were to leave the cap screwed down for 6 months, I'm sure that the batteries would drain down a bit.  Murphy's Law says it will be dead when you need it !!  One other things, the battery pack slides out and I and my friend found that the battery pack seems to rattle back and forth just a bit, so I put two wraps of black-tape around the pack and it worked perfectly as a spacer and no more rattle.  You do receive a coupld \\"O\\" rings in the box, but they are for replacing the existing O-rings to keep the unit water tight and not to put around the battery pack .  I've only had this flashlight for a month, but I love it.
B008GVD6D8|1.0|Since 50 shades of Grey there have been several novels written that are shamelessly similar. I get it. People want more: There's a demand and someone needs to fill it. Kudos to the authors who meet that demand. Since reading 50 Shades I've been one of those readers looking for more. As a result I've read many of the 'copycats' and Sylvia Day's copycat 'Bared to You' is by far the best. Unfortunately 'Reflected in You' was a huge disappointment sinking to the standard of many of the mediocre copycats. Here's were I think Sylvia failed:<br />- The heroine is a mess. I know that's part of her character but she regresses instead of progressing as a character and this I don't understand. Why build up the lead as someone who is still fighting her demons and in general succeeding in book one only to bring her back to the bumbling mess at the mercy of her demons that she was during her lowest point in life. I just don't get it. She isn't someone I can relate to or respect. In fact, I want to tell her to 'GET A GRIP!' What shocks me most of all is that no-one in her life is being this voice of reason. They allow her to make mistake after mistake after mistake. She's bends to the will of Cross time and again and I hate that in a heroine.<br />- Cross plays serious mind games! I know many love him but he treats her horribly: pushing her away then pulling her back to fulfill his physical needs. It bugs me that Eva gives in and jumps to fulfill his needs because she's so weak to his good looks that she can't keep her legs shut. What's more he is a serious control freak? I don't think any self-possessed women would put up with his ridiculous demands. How can she stand it? I understand why he does what he does by the end but still all these problems could have been dealt with with communication.<br />- Nothing happens. Literally. They fight, have sex, he treats her horribly, they have sex, he treats her horribly some more and the novel is over. When will authors learn that a plotis NECESSARY! Sex and a good looking lead is not enough.<br />I know you're going to read it anyway and I recommend that you do but be warned...you will be frustrated by the books end.
0525953728|3.0|I guess my expectations were too high.  Parts of the book are very good.  But the Author should have stuck to the mission and kept his personal feeling about politicians to himself.  I'm still glad to have it in my collection of military books.

B0087ZFH9Y|2.0|Love the Pistols but I can't find anything here I hadn't listen to 10 or even 15 years ago [not paying nearly $162.00 for one unheard demo] and a replica of the God Save The Queen single no thanks.  Where's the good stuff like the live shows [Longhorn ballroom, the last winterland concert or even Japan 96 I know there are a few shows that were filmed and heavily booted] Where's the real love for this band I just see this another money grabbing attempt *nothing new* =( A super deluxe \\"swindle\\" indeed a true fan would avoid this expensive mess.  The Filth And The Fury film is a better value than this put together just for *Filthy Lucre*
0439023521|5.0|I loved this book, I couldn't get my eyes off of it, it was like a drug; very addicted. My friend went to see the movie and told me about it, she also told me that it came from a book. And as I am a bookworm I bought it. Ok, I started to read, it talked about this girl, Katniss Everdeen, and how she lives. And then I get to the part of the reaping and I was thinking \\"Oh no, oh my god, she's gonna pick Katniss,noo!\\" But then, poof \\"Primrose Everdeen!\\" KATNISS' SISSTER!!!!!!!!!NOOOOOOO!!! It totally broke my heart when Katniss said she wanted to be a tribute and then told her lil sis. that she had to be strong.<br /><br />What I loved of this book is that is has feelings, not like other books that narrate you a story but that in the second page you want to leave because you think \\"God, dis book's boring\\". But that doesn't happens with this book, you just want to keep reading and reading, addicted. So when I finished I bought the second and the third because I NEEDED to know how it ended. This book is amazing, it has love, action, suspense...There are ,literally, heartbreaking scenes like when Rue died<br /><br />I strongly recommend you to read this amazing trilogy, then of course you can watch the movie that is also thrilling. And if you don't like to read, then watch the movie, but the book is like 100.000.000.000.000.000.000.000 (I don't have a clue what's dis number name is but, you understand my point) times better than the movie. So if you're a bookworm like me...READ THE HUNGER GAMES!!!<br /><br />Kisses<br /><br />AnonymousReader ;)
B008XG1X18|5.0|awesome app will always keep it installed. I have been using Pinterest for awhile, glad it came to android. .
0307592731|1.0|the book they sent me was defected.it was not finished product.the edge of the books looks rough coz the every page was not cut  properly.
B003VANOFY|4.0|This headphone is pretty good for what it is intended for.  I'm not sure I'm hearing the \\"7.1\\" but it does give you a sense of sound coming from all directions.  I bought this one first but figured I didn't really need the wireless so I returned it and went with the G35.  It is essentially the same headset but wired (and it was on sale for eighty bucks).  For a computer headset, I don't see the need for a wireless headset since you are sitting next to your computer anyway (for consoles I can see wireless being better).<br /><br />Quality of sound:  The drawback is that the sounds are in 16-bit 44.1KHz and I believe only up to 96KHz.  This is plenty good and CD-quality.  I don't think the mini drivers in this headset can really make 24bit 192KHz sampling shine anyway - like a good amplified studio headset which will cost way more (~$500).  I have a Bowers&Wilkins p5 headset I use for two-channel stereo music and the G35 doesn't quite measure up to that headset when listening to music, but I didn't buy this set for music so it doesn't matter to me.  But that's a relative measurement, it's better than most headphones you can buy that are under $50 bucks I'd say.<br /><br />Mic:  Mic seems to work as intended.  There are some voice morphing capabilities, but I'm not really intrigued by it. All my friends are able to hear me clearly and to me that's the only thing that matters.  The mic is bendable and retracts into place fine (for now).<br /><br />Connectivity:  USB only.  So that means it's strictly a PC headset.  For those of you who don't understand this concept, I'll explain it a little bit here.  That means that the headset has it own DAC (digital to audio converter) built-in and bypasses your sound card.  So it doesn't matter if you have a Soundblaster or Turtlebeach or onboard Realtek soundcard, it doesn't use any of that.  It will operate as its own and recieve all the digital signal and converts that to analog signals.  In other words, you are buying a soundcard + headphone + mic.  If you're hoping to use the \\"quality\\" sound card you have in your computer, you should get a different headset - like the Razer Tiamat.<br /><br />Comfort:  I've used it all day playing FPS and it doesn't bother me.  It has a \\"replacable\\" head pad if you have a different head shape or what not.  The volume on the left cup is handy.  I don't liek the G-keys.  They are not \\"customizable\\" and you are limited to assign somewhat useless command for media applications.  It may come useful if you use it for voice morphing shortcuts.  I kinda hope it wasn't there because I accidently press on them when I put the headset on or take it off.<br /><br />Wireless:  It has good range, probably no more than 30 feet.  I didn't really hear any major \\"delay\\" and it didn't interfere with my wireless internet signals.  I just didnt' see myself straying away from my computer to pay the wireless premium so I exchanged it for the G35.  I really liked that Razer Tiamat, but I didn't want to invest in a sound card.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because it does what I want but it is not the \\"best headset\\" that is worth the real \\"retail cost,\\" but I bought it on-sale (the G35).  The Razer Tiamat sounds much better, but you have to invest in a good sound card so that's an \\"added\\" cost if you don't already have a good sound card.
B00866H7SS|5.0|Amazing read! Liked it better thank the 50 shades trilogy. Can't wait for the last book to come out! A book that gets you obsessed with the characters.

B005LAIHXQ|1.0|What a terrible movie.  If you feel the urge to see this film, borrow it from a friend or rent it - I think you'll be happy you didn't buy this one.
B000852GIQ|3.0|The CD has 3 nice songs, all the rest are average for my taste preferences.  This CD is not as good as Amelie's soundtrack.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Poorly written, and the alien thing at the end made it worse. A robot officer that goes out of his way to support an agenda, by his creator. Give me a break! I knew what was going to happen before it actually did. Sorry writing. Sorry that I wasted money to watch it. Though I didnt order it thru Amazon. Because it only streams in 2 channel audio. If were to have ordered it thru Amazon there would be even more bad reviews for it. Dont waste your time folks....

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone interested in navy seals<br />Special forces or the killing of bin laden, or all three! The only disappointment was the size of the book...but even that wasnt that short...overall very impressed and satisfied with my purchase
B006LSZECO|3.0|(Contains Spoilers) The idea of not really knowing another human being, much less a spouse, is intriguing which is what made this such an interesting story line. As a wife of 26 years, I must confess that even I who have had ample time to and have made a thorough study of my husband could not anticipate and manipulate his every move in such detail as to plan a murder around it.  Of course, with her masters in Psychlogy maybe Amazing Amy has unique powers of observation.<br /><br />Equally perplexing is how Amazing Amy is able to persuade so many others that multiple individuals in her life have become obsessed with and stalked her.  Other than her beauty, there are no details in Amy's character development that exemplify that level of magnetism or charm.  A woman who writes trite questionaires for women's magazines is so fascinating that others cannot help their obsession?  Is Amy really that Amazing?<br /><br />And, would a truly Amazing Amy be satisfied with boring old Nick, after pulling off the perfect crime.  A Nick, she was apparently so bored with before he began his affair, that she had ceased pretending to be Amazing Amy?<br /><br />The alternating narrator technique was quite effective in propelling the story along, but perhaps adversely impacted the flawed character development of the protagonists.
B0050IY61G|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Feel I leaned a great deal by reading. Have a 13 year old grand daughter who is high functioning AS. Can now understand much more about the 'what's & why's' of here doings. Not to technical mostly easy to understand.
0553801473|5.0|I just loved this book. As with all the others the only thing i'm thinking is where is the next one.  I cant' get enough of them. That's why i'm starting them all over i do not want to leave what i call \\"Arya's World\\". These books blow every other book I've ever read away.

B007SGM084|2.0|Was expecting a brilliant trilogy, V ery slow paced novels. Unless you are into this stuff, do not waste your time. Can not recommended.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Interesting story, though much more formulaic than Follett's best work (Pillars of the Earth of course). Good enough to keep me turning the pages.  I'll buy #3 in the series when it's available.
B008G12ERC|5.0|I will keep this simple. Each and every Muse album are gems. But gems come in different colors and shapes. The 2cnd law is no different. If you are alienated by it then you might want to move on to another band. It does not appear that these guys want to move backwards or become a \\"once was\\" band. They clearly are constantly evolving, exploring new territory and I will assume having a great time doing it.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Enjoyed this movie a lot.  Characters were well-acted.  One really did have to suspend disbelief, however.  The people of India are indeed wonderful and warm.  India has a rich culture, is exciting and exotic.  However, you will not find the streets of India as meticulously clean as in this movie (yes, I've been to India twice as a medical volunteer).  All in all, a fine entertainment.
B000KWZ7VU|4.0|Barenboim has never been my favorite pianist. But I've always known the feeling he's brought to music both as a pianist (I like his Chopin Nocturnes) as well as as a conductor (some of the Hindemith he's done is outstanding). A DVD collection of all the Beethoven sonatas by a single artist is vulnerable to all the same complaints as a cycle on CD: odds are you can think of someone you'd rather swap out on a specific sonata.<br /><br />But right now the pickings are slim, and Barenboim is \\"first to market.\\" That having been said, I can't really complain about the set. It IS, after all, a set. By far and away it has more ups than downs, and its downs aren't that extreme. He plays with a wide range of dynamics, brings the skill, and understands the pieces.<br /><br />There are complaints in the reviews about the visual choices; I hear them, but I don't think this set is for people yearning to learn all the fingering. You get a fine mix of hand work and facial expressions. You see the technique, and you get plenty of shots of right hands crossing over the left and vice versa.<br /><br />Yes, people complain about the close ups of beads of sweat, instead of hands. But let's get serious: this is a DVD! It's *supposed* to provide a variety of visual experiences!<br /><br />My only complaint -- and this is the reason for my only giving it four stars -- is that the master classes are bundled in. Some of us aren't interested in that. And if we were, I would prefer to have them include a coupon to buy them, or some flyer announcing their availability. I don't need to be bundled.
0316228532|2.0|You know, J. K. Rowling has a huge amount of talent, and if you use Tolstoy's definition of art as something that makes you feel as if you were right there, then Ms. Rowling is definitely an artist.  Yet I hate every character in her book.  They could use some magic all right, but there isn't any to be had.  It was an extremely depressing experience, reading this book, and that is because of the author's extreme gifts.  I noticed, incidentally, that she still most values the Gryffindor mentality.  Courage and loyalty still seem to be her most admired qualities.  But other than that, such human misery!  Well-drawn, well-observed, yes.  Enjoyable to read, well, I'm not so sure.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Had this on tape a long time ago, decided to purchase for my Kindle fire. Love this movie, very rugged and believable. Also have the sound track which I play all the time.

B008PCVGKI|5.0|Bad Pharma highlights serious issues with the way the pharmaceutical industry works today. In the book Ben highlights the problems with the industry from several angles, how the tests can be tweaked, how negative tests are not published, how you can make a neutral test appear positive by sub-dividing the goals and then emphasize the fluke positive one. He also shows how the medical journals are part of the problem and the issue with ghost written articles. He shows the problems with the regulatory side as well, for example the European Medicines Agency, their lack of transparency, and how they have effectively blocked access to critical data for researchers. All through the book Ben makes use of well documented examples, and all the issues highlighted are well documented and exemplified.<br /><br />The book is written in an easy to access language, and so it reads well. He does repeat himself a bit, so one more round of editing and cleanup before release would probably have been a good idea. Some readers on amazon.co.uk have criticised this, but I don't see it as an issue.<br /><br />You don't need to have a degree in medicine or a higher degree in general to understand the issues Ben highlights.<br /><br />Ben Goldacre runs the Bad Science website (badscience dot net) and has previously written the book Bad Science. Where Bad Science was an attack on quackery and pseudo science, and his website to a large degree has dealt with the same topics, this book is a critical look at the pharmaceutical industry. As such it ought to silence those that have attacked Ben Goldacre for being in the pockets of the Pharmaceutical industry over time.<br /><br />Ben Goldacre has done society a big favour by writing this book. I definitely recommend reading it if you want to understand more about how US and European health care works and what can be done to improve it in the future.
034580404X|5.0|There is a reason why these books are so well known. I read all three books back to back and loved them. It was so hard to put them down. If you want to read something fun, and different (and of course, sexy) then you need to read these book. At least give the first one a try.
1573225517|5.0|You read this book and feel it's about you.  An eerie experience. It's as if it's your own life, thoughts, experiences, face feeling inside the pages.  That's rare in any medium -- and when it happens you have to be grateful. This book is a like a series of cloud patterns that forms your own face.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|The acting was not that great and had an awful plot, but the special effects were engaging and entertaining. There are only so many ways you could skin a cat since we all know the story of Snow White.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book caps off the series--the ending was somewhat abrupt but well worth the read. For those of you who can't wait to find out how Katniss saves her world, this book will be the one to answer the question.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It started off a little slow but was well worth the wait....can't wait for the next book to be released
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Percy Jackson is the best book series I've read in children's literature. He is truly an inspiring character and a true friend. In this latest book I was very excited for Percy and Annabeth being reunited. Then they have to go on a quest with Jason, Piper, Hazel, Frank, Leo, and their coach.  It contains danger, surprises, a little romance, and just plain funny dialogue, in a way that only Rick Riordan can deliver. I was only disappointed at the end because now I have to wait until next fall for more Percy and Annabeth. I shall be patient.
0786838655|5.0|I read this to my grandson. Not only did he love it, but I enjoyed imagining the Greek gods in modern day America - very clever.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|I liked it more than all the individual movies because of the interaction of the different characters, plus it was sort of funny. Casting was good and, although I feel Edward Norton was the perfect Hulk, I enjoyed Mark Ruffalo.
B005Q6MJ8O|5.0|I remember reading stories by C.S. Lewis when I was a kid and loving them. I started reading the series with my grandson and am just as enthralled today as I was back then. Every child should read The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. It's a classic that never gets old!
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|Thought provoking. Makes you much more aware and invites you to question.<br /><br />It forces you to be definitive about your doubts surrounding the dogma of religion. For me, it was also the first time the \\"wrath\\" and the brutal nature of the God of the Old Testament  was made evident.<br /><br />I feel more informed having read it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pintrest is the best!!! I love getting on here on a regular basis.....I'm a college kid so most (all) of my free-time is spent here looking at new decorating &amp; fashion ideas.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I have fun playing eternity warriors 2 it keeps me busy. and I hope a lot of people would like the game to.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was a big fan of 50 Shades until I picked up Bared to You and now I am hooked. Reflected in You was by no means a disappointment as some series are. The characters are realistic ,fully mental and recognize it. I have already pre-ordered the 3rd book
B008220CC4|5.0|\\"Sinister\\" is great! This is how the story goes: A true crime novelist who discovers a box of mysterious, disturbing home movies that plunge his family into a nightmarish experience of supernatural horror.<br /><br />The cast led by Ethan Hawke (as Ellison Oswalt) is great. The directing by Scott Derrickson (who also wrote the story & screenplay) is great. The story & screenplay by Derrickson & C. Robert Gargill is great.<br /><br />The music by Christopher Young is great. The cinematography by Chris Norr is great. The film editing by Frederic Thoraval is great. The casting by Sheila Jaffe & Ruth Salen is great. The production design by David Brisbin is great. The art direction by John El Manahi is great. The set decoration by Sarah Dennis & Amy Vuckovich, set dressings by Evan Seide is great. The costume design by Abby O'Sullivan is great. The visual effects supervised by Jason Piccioni & coordinated by Diane Macke is great. The stunts coordinated by Rob King, Manny Siverio & Trampas Thompson is great.<br /><br />This is a great and well-made (also well-crafted & well-acted) horror film that is entertaining. This is another hit from the producer of \\"Paranormal Activity\\" & \\"Insidious\\". Interestingly enough, this could be a great double horror movie feature this year, right next to the fourth \\"Paranormal Activity\\", which is coming out on Friday (early Thursday showings, as well), of course. This is also one of the best films of the fall season and one of the best horror movies of the year. It is also one of the best original horror movies in recent memory.
B005LF9AOQ|4.0|I couldnt wait for the season to be available online so went ahead a baught it. No regrets, very very funny.

B0086700CM|5.0|This game is fun and addicting. I cant put it down! It is a non-stop exciting thrill that everyone enjoys. All of my friends play it too!
0062086529|2.0|I bought a number of books for my grandson for his 2nd birthday.  This book may be better suited to an older child as he took no interest in this whatsoever.  The illustrations are extremely simplistic and almost monochromic.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|The different challenges keep it interesting.  The dark atmosphere set a good tone for the story.  It helps that Halloween is just around the corner.
B0002KZAKS|2.0|I ordered two of them and both arrived within a week. I tested both of them, they sound quite good as the majority reviewers said (that's why I bought this !!!). And they are solidly built too, not one of the pretty light microphone that comes in with cheap karaoke machine.<br />I don't expect to come with it, so no cable is OK for me.<br /><br />Here is the BUT ...... : there is no ON/OFF switch, this really pissed me off.<br />But this is my fault, I should have read the 1 star review first.<br />The photo shows no ON/OFF switch, however this does not catch any attention.<br />And all seller seems to have trouble to say \\"this product does not have this, does not have that...\\" It only says what the product does have.<br />Oh well, I got stuck with two microphones without ON/OFF switch.<br />I can buy an adapter with on/off switch for microphone.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This book with it's six different stories chopped into eleven different parts is definitely a bit difficult and a bit confusing. I also think it's brilliant. The stories themselves are pretty good and a knowledge of different forms of literature is a must.<br /><br />I had just read Moby-Dick, so the grammar in the beginning was like second nature to me. The second story's language reminded me a bit of Jeeves and Wooster, even though the characters weren't nearly as likable. Then we get a '70s that slipped on like an old shoe. I think we've all read a book like it at some point. Next we get an absurdest story that made me laugh out loud. The next story is right out of Aldous Huxley and didn't affect me as much as the other stories, because it was TOO familiar. Finally we come to a post-apocalyptic story with a Hawaiian accent. The language was the toughest here about the flow of the language eventually made the going easy.<br /><br />Now that you got that far, you start right back down the other side of this mountain of a book. It's like hitting a ski slope back through time through the rest of the book.<br /><br />The stories are pastiche after pastiche, and that is fine. It sort of pulls you out of the novel once in a while and reminds you that you are reading a story. I don't consider that a bad thing. That's very popular in postmodern fiction and I really enjoy running into that in a novel. The writer also criticizes his own writing throughout the book, which I believe that average critics would hate, but I really enjoyed.<br /><br />What I absolutely love is that it is six interlinks stories. I've read plenty of meta-fiction and this is a meta-fiction with more layers than I've ever seen. The stories are pretty good, but the whole of the book is epic. It's big, it's complicated, it's full of stories that seem very familiar and I loved every minute of it.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Very entertaining for my granddaughter - Great story and lots for her to enjoy.  I like how I can just rent the movie as needed with my ROKU device.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I love the music on Dylan's new album Tempest, it includes all his trademark styles and more. We have whimsical Bob, we have love song Bob, Blues Bob, dark Bob, enigmatic Bob, storyteller Bob, and tribute Bob (to John Lennon). Dylan can more or less do what he likes anyway, producing his own songs under the pseudonym Jack Frost. My only regret is the paucity of information in the sleeve. No-one pretends to understand Dylan's wild and poetic imagery fully, but I wouldn't have minded the lyrics of the songs to muse over at my leisure. Apart from that, Ab Fab, roll on Bob!
B00003CXPD|3.0|The photography and the acting is wonderful, (the acting that is) if you could understand the dialect.  I swear this film should have been released with subtitles.<br /><br />The movie mostly was the expression of the actors, occassionally a word I could understand.  I have no problem hearing, I could hear a flea fart.  I would like to have had the sound track cleared up or sub titles.<br /><br />The premise of the film as best as I could tell is that an artistic boy (child) in a poor working class neighborhood<br />doesnt work well to be exact not at all.  I found one scene in particular really hard to watch.  The scene involves<br />Billy's  gay friend and Billy dancing in the boxing ring.  All of a sudden he is discovered by his father who just looks like he could kill the boy.  Then Billy goes in a wild dance pulling out all the stops, its as if he dancing for his life.<br /><br />I could have loved this film but with the dialogue I'd have to give it a 3 out of 5
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|this is a moving tale of tragedy that is handled with love and lies and truth.  It struck a chord in  my heart because my 1st grandchild was born with severe Goldenhar,a disease.  She endured every sling and arrow that cruel and unthinking fools can throw.<br /><br />It is with astonishment that I write to say that she is engaged to be married next July.  For me,  Wonder is a winner.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Another super fun installment in the Percy Jackson adventure! I loved getting to hear from Percy again and meet new characters too. The introduction of the Roman camp kept things new and interesting. I'm just as hooked on this new series as I was on the original.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Well I definitely shed a few tears at this movie.  Ok, maybe more than a few, but give me a break, it's a touching story about a dog.  Who wouldn't cry?  And even better, it's loosely based on a true story.<br /><br />When Parker finds a puppy on his way home from the train station, he doesn't intend to keep it.  But when no owner turns up, and he develops an attachment for the Akita dog, he adopts himself a pet.  Hachi is very close to Parker and as he grows he begins finding ways to see him off and meet him at the train station everyday for Parker's commute.  But Hachi's loyalty is put to the test when one day, Parker doesn't come off the train.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Hachi: Played by Chico, Layla and Forrest<br />Richard Gere: Parker Wilson<br />Joan Allen: Cate Wilson<br />Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa: Ken Fujiyoshi<br />Sarah Roemer: Andy Wilson<br />Jason Alexander: Carl Boilins<br />Erick Avari: Jasjeet<br /><br />I think each person (and dog) was picked appropriately for their role.  The dogs were all marvelously trained and wonderfully cute, and I could feel the stirring and want for a dog as a result.  Alas, I would only adopt an adult dog rather than buy a puppy because of how I feel about rescues, but they were undeniably cute and my cats would never forgive me anyway.  So no dog for now.  Richard Gere as Parker was also very good and I could really identify with him and his love for Hachi.  They shared a very close bond and you couldn't really tell it was a movie relationship instead of a real one.  The other characters don't feature as much, but I did really like Jasjeet and his concern and care for Hachi.  A very redeeming person and he was played well by Avari.<br /><br />There isn't a lot of action in this film.  No intrigue, suspense, etc.  It was a story of loyalty and that's all that was needed.  Simply seeing Hachi's life was enough.  And they even filmed it as though some of it was through his eyes without trying to make it seem from a human's perspective.  It was just Hachi, as a dog, seeing what he was seeing and reacting to it.  And I liked that.  But I also liked the family and their interaction with Hachi, and Parker's devotion to him.  The fact that I used up half a box of tissues isn't even a problem.  If a movie is good enough to make me cry then there is no way I'm not going to adore it.  That being said, if you can't handle hard topics, you may not want to watch this movie.  But any animal lover will be able to understand and relate to it.<br /><br />As said before, this movie is sometimes shot from Hachi's view, which is interesting.  It's not quite black and white, but there is an absence of color but it seems realistic.  Not that I know what a dog sees, but this could definitely be plausible.  The rest is standard filming and it wasn't too shaky or anything, it was just there to capture the film.  And the music was also in the background.  Parker was a professor of music, but it's mostly light calming music and it fits into the background to set a backdrop, not to be the main focus.<br /><br />Fantastic movie that really captured the life of a wonderful dog.  Even though it was only loosely based on a real story, the themes of loyalty and love are well presented.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012spective.

It seems like two different names for the same condition.  In any case, if you are female and suspect that you are a HSP you should probably take the Aspie test:<br /><br />[...]<br />[...]<br /><br />And/or read this great -- if long -- Aspergirls blog post about women and Asperger's syndrome:<br />[...]<br /><br />Whatever name you give it, it's be a difficult road so best of luck to everyone!

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett never ceases to amaze me.  His depth of research into various periods of history just make everything come alive so vividly it's as if you were there.  I knew when I finished the first of this trilogy I would have to read all three because his characers are always so fascinating.  I have read some of his other books and one day I will make it my \\"bucket list\\" to read them all.  These books will capture you from the first chapter to the last.
1476712042|3.0|This book was captivating and entrancing the same way an accident on the freeway is. Or the way the TLC Show Here comes Honey Boo Boo is. It is utterly addicting and you can't look away but when you are done you can't remember why you were so mesmerized. For me, Beautiful Disaster was a complete hot mess of a book but I still couldn't put it down. When I was finally able to stop and look back the book though the story was only okay.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster follows the story of Abby Abernathy and her best friend America who travel far away from their hometown to attend college. Abby is trying to leave her past behind and find \\"the right\\" kind of boyfriend. This plan is crushed completely when she meets Travis Maddox a total player who is also involved in an underground fight club on campus. Abby does her best to avoid Travis but he is the roommate of America's boyfriend and after losing a bet with him she can't really avoid him any more.<br /><br />The relationship between Abby and Travis is completely wrong and unhealthy. They are abusive, terrible to one another, there is constant miscommunication, and it was a relationship neither of them should have been in. But the two of them somehow make it work and I found myself rooting for them despite all of the odds being stacked against their favor. I think if the relationship had been a healthy one this book would not have been nearly as addicting as it was.<br /><br />Random Rant: I am a little bit tired of reviewers saying that the reason they don't like a book is because of the unhealthy relationship (e.g. Fifty Shades of Grey, Beautiful Disaster, Twilight). No one wants to read about the good healthy couple, everyone wants to read the crash and burn story that someone ends in a happily ever after. So while you may have disliked a relationship I want reviewers to give more reasons for their dislike of the book and not just rant about how these types of books are setting bad examples.<br /><br />Now that I got that off my chest I feel like I can continue. One of the reasons I wasn't able to give this book more stars was because of the ending. Beautiful Disaster ends in a nice shiny Happily Ever After and while most people like these (myself included) I felt like the end, in this case, was a bit of a cop out. I wanted more after all of the craziness Abby and Travis went through but was left going, Ok so I guess they are staying together...good for them? I couldn't muster up the energy to care about their relationship they way I had in first half and middle of the book.<br /><br />Overall, Beautiful Disaster was a completely addicting read that I enjoyed but had a few problems with. For me it was just an ok read, nothing special, nothing too bad, I remember the story over a month after reading it so I guess it did something right but I'm not sure I will ever have the energy to reading Walking Disaster the companion novel that tells the same story from Travis's POV.<br /><br />Thank you Netgalley and Atria Books for allowing me to review a copy of this novel.hat off my chest I feel like I can continue.

B007L3BMGA|4.0|A brilliant author who researched well.  The music equally enjoyable and captivating - together with the story line, I was spellbound
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am totally consumed by the Fifty Shades trilogy. The best books I have ever read. Most romantic love story. Erotics are a huge plus. Puts the spice back in most marriages:) CANNOT WAIT FOR THE MOVIE(S)!
B0083Z614S|5.0|Its been a long time since i read this book. it warms your heart and is a joy to read!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Who would have thought that this book would be such a page turner.  Couldn't put it down.  Gives insight as well as information.  Read it for better and for worse.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|dvd came super quick. I just finished watching every episode of this great show and everything worked. no scratches or skipping. super pleased!!!
B0046W5E0Y|5.0|We have watched this at least 20 times.  She loves Tinkerbell and the gang.  She has watched the first 3 of these movies and looking forward to seeing the 4th; however, I believe this one will always be her favorite.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is definitely on my top 5 list of sci-fi books. Everything about it is intoxicating and it stays fresh and unpredictable. You never become bored of any character because the perspectives change so often and you can be inside the minds of many different characters as the story progresses. The author creates such a believable world and many well rounded characters that I have nothing to criticize. Simply perfect! If I could erase my memory and re-read these books, I would! I bought the Molly Fyde series immediately after I finished reading Wool. The price is a rip off to the AUTHOR, so don't hesitate =)
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|This app was cool, until I updated it 10 minutes ago. It totally uninstalled my game and took me back to level 1. Not happy!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was an awesome game! Sad it was over but made the weekend great fun! recommend to anyone who loves a good mystery!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Wild is a great story, was so easy to find myself in so many parts of it even tho I have never even been on the \\"trail\\".  Made me proud of how strong women are or can be.
B004CURZFC|3.0|Some nice animation, however I had something of a hard time visually telling the characters apart, and when they were in battle it was hard to tell which side was which at times as well.  However, a nice story of bravery, courage and character.<br /><br />Not a movie I would like to watch multiple times though and I just don't see this being a favorite for the kids to watch either...but good to see once.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Read this after it was recommended by a friend.  I was surprised at how emotionally invested I became in this story.  I found Beautiful Disaster to be well written and the characters of Abby and Travis to be very complex and well developed.  If you're looking for a book to get caught up in, I highly recommend it. The Underground Fighting and overall violence seem to be a theme in these Contemporary Romance novels, as I recently read another that centered on the same themes. I can't wait for the next book!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book from start to finish. Christian Grey and his Fifty Shades....Best book I have read so far. I was a little worried before ordering because of some of the other reviews, but I am glad I decided to order it anyway.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|I freakin love this show.  Been watching from the first day back when Rick was in the Hosp.  This season is starting off very diff from the past two seasons.  The group seems to be more of a tactical swat team instead a bunch of scared lost people.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Our book club read the book.  We found it full of life lessons and synchronistic examples.  We would recommend it to everyone.
B000002OG5|5.0|This was the original one my husband was looking for, and this will be prefect for him to listen to driving in the car.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVED THESE BOOKS! I couldn't put them down! Read all three in 1 week! Lost a lot of sleep! But was worth it!
B001QKSWOE|5.0|It was a wonderful, fun time from Janet Evanovich as I expected. She never disappoints! I enjoyed \\"Spooky\\" like sitting with an old friend and visiting.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I do not understand why on earth this book is so popular, it is far to repetative, and terribly immature,i had to give up after five chapters.

B008XG1X18|5.0|Love Pinterest, it's my newest addiction.  The app has forced closed on me a couple times, but well worth the wait.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|The music and graphics put Bejeweled to shame.  This is the best free app of the day in recent history.  I can't say that I regret my purchase.
0316228532|5.0|I warmed slowly to the book at first but by the end I thought it was genius. I was amazed at the raw emotions, abject poverty, and despair she talked about and yet it is supposed to be a dark comedy.  I work with kids (and their parents) who are socially comparable to her characters from \\"the Fields\\" and I felt it too realistic to get much humor from it. It is also a story on race and political issues and that part was funny but at the same time, I felt, a window into the sad reality of how social climbing and power can be so very corruptive. Overall I was captured by the characters.<br /><br />Also, I've just come off a few years of detective series - John Sandford's Lucas Davenport series, James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheaux series, Lisa Gardner's DD Warren's series - you get the picture. I kept waiting for action or mystery to start and it didn't happen. Yet, I couldn't give the book up. I was drawn into the characters and like a town member I wanted the gossip and what would happen next.<br /><br />What I found genius about this book is her insight into people's underlying pain and motives. From the most pathetic drug addict absentee mother to one of the town's richest, most successful doctor's, you see their inner struggles and feel that everyone is flawed in their own way. So like I said, I was captured by the characters but sadly, I found NONE of them likable or redeemable until the end.<br /><br />I think Rowling shows she can write way beyond the HP series and her writing is subtle yet powerful. I definitely recommend it.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|I don't know who would break up with Ellie Goulding, but someone did--and the heartache is heard in the lyrics of almost every song. The melodies are great, and the beats are heavier than those in Lights. I'm really digging Ellie's darker side.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I found this book as well as book 1 hard to put down.  I enjoyed this book and am now almost finished with book 3.  I am only disappointed there are not more in the series.
B004GK2B6Q|4.0|This movie was a last minute choice after searching for something all of us were interested in. As it turns out, the story and animation was worth the every moment. The time we spent watching was filled with silence as there were no groans from anyone about why did we have to watch this movie. I would watch again without hesitation.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|The trilogy was intriguing; creating lots of anticipation and emotion - giving an insight in a diffferent world.  Definitely not to be missed!
1906694176|1.0|I was dissapointed from the beginning in this, the 3rd of the trilogy. I found much of the story simply unbelievable. The sexual situations don't ring true to me. And the factual information surrounding the workings of the Swedish Secret Police, and it's many departments and secret departments within departments all seem so contrived. Editing is needed-much of the detail he offers simply does not move the story forward. And lastly, the lengthy description of the trial is very poorly done-no trial in any civilized country is conducted with lawyers who go from arguing to 'testifying' as was done in this trial. Booooogus!
B001A4LYN2|5.0|This story reminds us of the emptiness of man left to his own devices. Regardless of how it looks on the outside the inside of every man is a black hole of never-to-be-satisfied desire. Our peace and fulfillment come when we bring our appetites I to some civilized order and learn to manage our desires. Great great story.
B0090EIC3Y|1.0|I was super disappointed. I'm a big Cohen fan and this movie was straight up stupid. I watched 30 minutes which felt like 30 hours and stopped wasting my time.
0307711773|5.0|My son and I have listened to the audio book several times since buying it in June. He will listen to it at least once a month. He enjoyed the Percy Jackson series and loves the new series with Jason and the other romans. He can't wait for the Mark Of Athena!
1609611543|5.0|I heard about the book via an email advertisement and decided I would check it out. I purchased the Kindle version first and then a hard copy from Amazon.<br />I was amazed and horrified by the information I read in Wheat Belly. I have changed my food intake as per the book and it has and is making a healthy and wonderful improvement in my life. I am no longer on diabetic medication and my blood pressure has dropped significantly. I highly recommend the book Wheat Belly.
B001NLL0RW|4.0|This was a great read.  Since I'm 73 I sometimes get lost in the people/situation switches, but it is only for a few minutes.  I especially like his reviews as to what's true and what's not.
0307712508|5.0|I don't really know how to describe this book.  My favorite genre is historical fiction & in a sense this was like that, but without the fiction.  It is an important story and lesson in ethics that should be required reading for future scientists and anyone going into the medical field.  But I think it is important reading for us \\"average Joes\\" as well & I know that I now really scrutinize anything I am being asked to sign by a doctor or hospital.  It also made me very glad that in terms of medicine, I don't live in the 1950s.  I really wish that there was a fair way to compensate the Lacks family for what they went through.  At the very least, I think Johns Hopkins should offer to provide free medical care to the remaining children of Hentrietta Lacks.<br /><br />I hope to see other books like this from Skloot in the future - I'm sure it is an area brimming with subject matter.

B008J9EYFG|4.0|Beth Orton's voice is ethereal, magical and haunting. This is such a beautiful album. Just got it today and am enjoying each song as it unfolds. It's soothing and intricate. Really lovely.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I started playing Coin Dozer a few weeks ago and got hooked playing for hours on end.  I had almost completed getting all the prizes plus a whole lot extra.  I completed 2 of the puzzles ; needed only 1more swing to complete the rewards part.  I had over a thousand coins. and my Kendle would not charge anymore so I was given a new Kindle and when I started playing again I had to start all over again.  I am so dissapointed.  It took so long to get where I was.  I can't get my coins to build up and I lose half of my prizes before they get to the bottom.  It will take forever to get back where I was.  Why can't the progress transfer like it did with several of my other ongoing apps?  I would love to finish this but don't think I can spend dozens of hours to do it. it's just too frustrating although I do love the game and would give it 5 stars otherwise.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Typed my observations as I played this game on my tablet resulting sadly in about two dozen unsatisfactory remarks.  For a few examples:  requires too many screens to start actual gameplay / text popup overlays annoyingly ground graphics  / will not allow fast consecutive matching (each match must start or complete before next one effective) / woman's voice irritating in its fake comments / sound effects not interesting (of half dozen games exactly like this that I have played Bejeweled has best audio and most inspiring or rousing comments on successful moves) / full canvas space not utilized fully or esthetically  / features such as Map make little sense, and worse that Exit does not exit game.... I rate this game a high 4 and can see how folks who have not played similar games may rate this game higher.  I judge it Excellent for a first user, though for me with minimum six like games under my belt, it comes in average. Yet so much work went into it (certainly nothing scholarly) I will still give it a high 4 to encourage the producers to fix issues.<br />  For reviewer here on Amazon who rated it Low and complained of high ratings, may I add this photo that shows it at iTunes very highly rated?  You will get same result if you copy and paste name of game into your search engine and in front type \\"review\\".  My search today said: 1,055 votes and star rating at 4.5 at least at date shown of Mar 23, 2012.
B001AYENBM|1.0|This was a good movie at the theatre (4stars).  So, I wanted to see what this alt ending was like.  My opinion is that this movie is good until the ending; LAME.  It seems to dislocate the continuity and consistency of the film.  How would one feel after destroying all humans and creatures on Earth.  And when his best friend dies, he goes postal.  Anyway, was his escape a dream Or was his escape just a result of his mind fracturing or diverging.  So was the woman and child real or were they internal conflicts; his way of saving yet sabatoging himself?  Is there a right or wrong answer?
B0049J2CKE|5.0|I have two boys age's 3 and 5 years old. Once we played this for them, they had to watch it over and over. Kids loved it and we did not mind the kids watching it. Nothing bad to say about the movie.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I never get disappointed when it comes to Criminal minds. I am very pleased that \\"JJ\\" is back. I missed her when she got off the show for a while in the sixth season.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I can say without hyperbole that this is my favorite app. It has so many choices of sounds that don't sound tinny or digital. I really appreciate the timer. It is very customizable. It is pretty. It really does help relieve my insomnia.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I thought this would be a goofy app but it is addicting and fun. Its easy to add friends that play and has beautiful artistry within the game. I find myself playing this game daily.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|great story line as well as the interaction between all the characters...can't wait till the next installment and the next thor movie as well
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|Love the game but since ive gotten to the Church to go down into the &quot;secret passage&quot; it wont let me enter. Cant even back up to get out of the view of the doors. Wouldve really liked to finish the game but apparently that isnt going to happen :(
0316228532|5.0|Bitter, sarcastic, delicious, nasty. This is J.K. Rowling you don't know. Ghastly, loving, disgusting, bleak, sensual, murderous, lusty. This is J.K. Rowling you never read. Real, human, mundane yet complex and heartbreaking, The Casual Vacancy is a story of one man who did more by dying then he did by living, a story penned over an idyllic English town that is all sparkle on the surface but rotten guts inside. Or is it? What J.K. Rowling did here is take the grit of ordinary life and elevate to the heights of beauty, with all of its daily drama, dirty politics, gossip, abuse, neglect, rape, violence, drug addiction, bullying. The list goes on. Rest assured, every aspect of our imperfection is touched upon, and masterfully at that.<br /><br />I wanted to read this book so badly because of all the negative reviews I'd seen. And, I loved it, loved it, LOVED IT. It's brillance is hidden in scenes of husbands and wives chit-chatting over a breakfast of toast that might seem boring to an untrained eye, but upon further examination reveal layers and layers of elegant humor and satire that got me laughing out loud. Above all, it's real, and in that - it's touching. It's tightly woven - every little detail ever mentioned comes into play, from a peanut allergy to a watch. And it exposes the reality of every day crimes that might be too much for some to stomach, but made me cry, because I grew up like that. On some pages it was too close to home, too close.... yet I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Read it. You will be blown away.
034580404X|5.0|OMG I love it, I kept reading all night and hardly left the book in chapter 11 to sleep @9:30 am.<br />Can't wait to finish it tonight and to read the other 2 book

B005VW4Q70|5.0|I like the acoustic guitar and the latin rhythms.  The download was fast.  The diablo rojo track was the track that I was looking for, but decided to get the whole soundtrack instead.  I was pleasantly surprised.
B003297I1U|5.0|My son loves construction trucks and had asked for a crane for his birthday.  I was hesitant at first because of the price, but I am SO GLAD I bought this.  My son (6 years old) absolutely LOVES this and he played with it for a week straight before touching any of his other new toys.  Its very sturdy and realistic and you can actually lift things with the little crane.  I will be buying another Bruder truck for sure!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun and hard all in one game. I would recommend it because it worth it to get the game. I just love it. it entertaing. it worth it .

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I simply loved this book! I read it in one night. The characters were so real and I  related so well to their crazy and beautiful connection!
B008G8SFGO|4.0|Before I get hit by the Self appointed KISS Police, I do like Most of MONSTER. The previews I heard on amazon were<br />what caught me, so I decided to buy the most appealing item available at the time, which was the lenticular case (<br />the 3D insert and Booklet ) at Best Buy. KISS ONLINE clearly advertised the Best Buy version as having a extra<br />track. What happened on release day is that you clicked on the kissonline link, no info suddenly, and then the<br />bestbuy page changes, and no page for the disc summary on best buy. Kind of weird? Maybe, but definitely a little<br />bit of a false advertising. Anyway, I am not the only person who noticed this sudden ommission ( Maybe iTunes<br />complained about the lack of exclusive deal). The Booklet in the Best Buy item is quite good actually. I plan to<br />get the extra albums, unless they get pulled. But I have been expecting a return to the 70s feel,since the<br />statement by Paul and gene to this effect. The strongest songs in MONSTER are by Gene, contrary to what some have<br />said. The basic album is I think pretty good, but its like the 80s feel revisited, and Gene is there ( if you<br />followed the statements at the time in Kiss releases, there were Statements to the effect that in the 80s, Gene was<br />not on this KISS planet, and so not contributing, well, I guess MONSTER is the 80s album is what we get when Gene<br />contributes. It is great, but I still think HELL AND HALELUJAH is not the best. After hearing MONSTER I went back<br />to SONIC BOOM and I did kind of like the album more, so I think thats the album that required multiple listens to get into. Some people get too defensive. I still think that this is the Paul and Gene Show, and they are great. Eric<br />Singer is a great drummer, and I like him better than Thayer, since Singer has the more credibility since his<br />public comments had indicated that he wanted his own makeup and ID. Thayer on the other hand, has no redeeming<br />values, since he is a hired hand who is an Ace clone, who has never said that he wanted his own makeup, and his<br />playing in the Monster vein, assuming they are his solos and not Paul, are just so similar to Frehleys lines. Good<br />Album, gene is the standout, I still hope that they go back to the 70s style and do what they do best in that<br />style, which is a totally awesome individual musical sound that no-one else has ever done, together with the show<br />they can still do. Long Live the 70s, the original KISS.<br />  I will get the extra versions of the album and add images and comments as I get them.
B009OYSURI|4.0|This was a great episode, I almost didn't recognize  Kim Wayans or McKenzie Phillips, they were great.  However I miss Emily, The new girl is good, but she's not Emily Prentiss, I love the show because they have strong women that don't have to show skin to get notice or play super cop women, they seem real. I was happy that they brought JJ back.  I like agent Hotchter.
0553582038|3.0|While the previous books in this series had me glued, this one I had absolutely no problem putting down.  It just isn't as interesting, suspenseful nor entertaining as the ones before.  Too many new characters, too much going on, scattered storyline, nothing or nobody to \\"root\\" for.  I forced myself to finish it and although I REALLY want to love the next one (Dance with Dragons), from what I read in the reviews it's more of the same.  Perhaps the author is looking to extend the storyline to keep the tv series going?  I'm not sure what happened here, all I know is that it's lost the power that existed in the first few books.  I believe this series has \\"jumped the shark\\".
1416550534|3.0|I almost stopped reading and had it not been for the fact this was a book club choice - I kept going.  Then to my surprise the book began to pick up and ended up being very interesting.
B00968THRE|5.0|Ellie Goulding released her new album Halcyon, and predecessor to her hit album Lights, on October 5th. It is not uncommon to see an artist fizzle out after a highly successful first album. This is not the case for Goulding. Halcyon shows a more mature Goulding, and shows that Goulding is here to stay.<br /><br />Halcyon is a time in the past that was peaceful or happy. The choice of Halcyon as the title of the album is incredibly indicative of the tone of the album. The song speaks of loneliness and struggles of love, but states, \\" It's gonna be better.\\" This is the theme of the album. Despite the fact that life can be difficult, things will get better.<br /><br />\\"Anything Could Happen\\" and \\"My Blood\\" stand out as two of the top tracks on the album, garnering the most popularity on iTunes. There are many gems on this album, and no doubt people will love and favor other tracks. Ellie has kept herself fresh in the music industry, and if Halcyon is any indication of her future it is looking bright.
B009A3NGF4|4.0|They didn't disappoint with this album.  Not quite as good as the previous but still really good.  Every song is worth listening to.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love it. I have found so many fun things. thank you for helping me plan my life and favorite things!
B000FA5SMK|3.0|I am getting a bit tired of the hero's (John Corey) smart-alec remarks on everything said by others. In moderation they were clever and funny. But too much becomes cynical. Less is more.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|It is very convenient for me. I have the ability to view my saved files and documents anywhere at anytime. I can make share folder(s) with other people to view. Very Good!
B0067QPVJ6|1.0|I dont usually write reviews but I had just had to shout about how bad this movie is,there is just no point to it,all it does is try & explain what happened at the norwegian camp that we saw in the 1982 version,why? as you watch the 1982 version unfold you realise that what is happening is what happened at the norwegian camp,that was the idea,that being said I sat back half expecting to be at least mildly entertained but no chance,all the tension & genuinely creepiness of john carpenters classic is just not here,there was nothing original & it was just plain boring,if the 1982 version never exsisted this movie would be on the sci fi channel. I saw a couple of people say that they always wanted to know how the axe had come to be where it was,are you kidding me? talking like it was a true story,jeez.I just cant believe how so many people rated this 5 stars,im actually quite envious of those people,wish I was that easily pleased,this movie is terrible,plain & simple,avoid at all costs.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Room: a novel is a compelling story through the eyes of a child. A woman teaches her son the safety of a world she  wants to remember. But once in the ‘TV‘ world, how can a boy learn that what was real is not real, that there is more beyond Room?
0143116738|4.0|As someone who didn't discover my own passion for writing until my late forties, I really appreciated Ken Robinson's The Element: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything. He makes some obvious (yet scathingly honest) observations about worldwide education systems as we know them--systems that are based on an industrial, assembly-line model of conformity and take a \\"fast food\\" approach to \\"quality control.\\" Robinson notes that this approach mandates uniformity, emphasizes a miniscule number of academic disciplines (most notably language and math) and squelches creativity. He advocates a more individualistic \\"Michelin\\" approach that would set a high bar for educational performance and excellence while allowing individual schools to determine the ingredients that would best serve its curriculum needs and decide how to attain its educational goals as circumstances warrant.<br /><br />I especially loved Robinson's illuminating discussion of the \\"Pro-Am\\"--those individuals whose creative outputs are sufficiently accomplished to be considered \\"professional\\" in quality, but who, for whatever reasons (most notably, the need to earn a \\"real\\" living and the small odds of doing so through solely artistic endeavors), cannot pursue them full time and are thereby labeled \\"amateurs.\\" His discussion of how creative outlets for self-expression can actually enhance one's tolerance for--and performance of--more mundane income-producing jobs rang especially true for me.<br /><br />I also appreciated his candid treatment of several other uniquely human concerns, such as the fact that we load our bodies with mass-produced crap, fail to exercise them, and then wonder why we are ill, depressed, and dependent on pharmaceutical drugs. I was shocked to learn that suicides account for more deaths worldwide than \\"all armed conflicts\\" (although he does not clarify during what time period), and that the World Health Organization now counts suicide as the third highest cause of death among people aged fifteen to thirty. This fact should serve as an alarming wake-up call to the world community that something is fundamentally wrong with our collective approach to life, and yet little attention is being brought to bear upon this critical issue.<br /><br />Robinson also highlights the fact that we alter the earth's ecosystems with impunity to serve our short-term economic, industrial and technological needs, then bury our heads in the sand when the obvious results--most notably climate change--manifest before our very eyes. Robinson quotes Jonas Salk's observation that if we managed to eradicate the entire insect population, all other forms of life would be gone within fifty years. And yet, if the human population were to disappear from the face of the earth, within fifty years all other forms of life would flourish. What does this rather sobering statement reveal about us?<br /><br />And then there's the equally somber fact that we are propagating our species at an alarming speed and with utter disregard for its inevitable consequences. Did you know that the world's population, just one billion in 1750, took until 1930 to double? And yet, we added another billion people by 1970 (thereby increasing our numbers from two billion to three billion), and doubled that figure--to six billion--by 1999? According to Robinson, we are estimated to add another three billion people to the face of our small planet by the middle of the next century. Where are all of these people going to live? What will they do for work--or for water? Clearly, we have got to get our population under control and stop having so many children if we want there to be anything left of our planet for future generations. The irrefutable and inevitable outcomes of our collective reproductive experiment are simply too chilling to be ignored.<br /><br />But The Element is far more than a depressing expos&eacute; of the sad state of the world and its educational and economic systems. The Element is aninspiring testament to the rich diversity of our personal and collective human intelligence, and a plea at both the institutional and individual levels that we discover and nurture our unique talents and passions for the ultimate good--and indeed survival--of the human race. My two biggest complaints with this book are #1, that it contained a rather high number of typographical and grammatical errors for a professionally-published book (whoever read my library copy before me corrected them in pencil!), and #2, there were too many so-called success stories about people who hated or dropped out of school. If you're not an especially big fan of the Beatles, you won't appreciate Robinson's many references to them--over a dozen in all. But apart from these minor shortcomings, The Element is an important and highly relevant nonfiction work whose crucial lessons can benefit us all.ing testament to the rich diversity of our personal and collective human intelligence, and a plea at both the institutional and individual levels that we discover and nurture our unique talents and passions for the ultimate good--and indeed survival--of the human race.

0062082353|5.0|This is an excellent book written about, and by, a true American hero. As a former combat tested Marine - with other family members who were/are Marines, and one who was a Navy SEAL - I think Chris Kyle really nailed it with his descriptions of the combat experience and the true cost to the family back home. Having been on both sides of the deployment fence, I salute a true American patriot who continues to share his experience with those that are on the front lines of America's defense every day. God Bless Chris Kyle, his family, and his colleagues.
0439023521|4.0|The Hunger Games is a stunning tour de force that sweeps you away to another time and place. The author is an expert at creating such a fast pace that hours pass before you look up from the book. My only criticisms are her use of the first person present tense, of which I'm not a fan, and the strong similarity between this book and the famous Japanese movie, Battle Royale, which appeared years before this trilogy.
0061120073|5.0|I love reading memoirs and I love reading about different time periods. Though this is classified as fiction, it is about the author's life growing up in Brooklyn in the early 1900's. This book spoke to me and gave me a deeper appreciation for what I have.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This is the second book in the Hunger Games trilogy.  If you liked Hunger Games then you will probably like this one as well.  It continues with many of the story lines from the first book, and introduces a rather darker aspect of politics.  And it has more exciting games - and not just in the arena.<br /><br />These books are a pretty easy read - easy to put down and pick back up (although there are places in the book where you will not want to put it down).  Overall, I recommend this, especially to Hunger Games fans.
0425263908|4.0|This one is way better than Fifty Shades. It's still major Mommy-porn, but without the S&M. Will definitely read book 2.
B008KGPEQG|4.0|I found this memor very interesting in many sections and a bit boring in others - but the interesting parts really make it worth the read.  It is like a dairy and jumps from one subject to another.  It is very touching to follow his aging process and he can write beautifully.  At first it was disconcerting that he uses the second person (you) instead of the first person (I) but it quickly seems very natural.  I orginally had a bit of trouble getting into it and put it down for a while but eventually went back and then I enjoyed it.  I can definitely recommend it as it has many profound insights into mortality, aging, family, etc.
B005LAJ212|5.0|This is a great dvd set if you like/love the show. I watch it with my best friend and we even got our boyfriends into the show and they want to watch it just as much as we do.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|This is a definite upgrade from the previous release, Sonic Boom.  It has a much more authentic quality and fits perfectly in the KISS album collection.<br /><br />This album has some definite highs and some definite lows.  I will give a quick track-by-track analysis.<br /><br />Hell or Hallelujah - Great representation of the Monster album.  Great pick for first single.  It's got a great riff, strong bass-line, thunderous drums, and Paul sounds great.  The chorus hook is quite catchy and it makes it a KISS Klassic!<br /><br />Wall of Sound - Awesome Riff!!!  The riff is heavy and catchy and is definitely a personal favorite.  Wall of Sound has some of the qualities of some the songs of the Revenge album.  Gene vocals sound powerful and his lyrics are quite cool!<br /><br />Freak - Not my favorite.  I understand it as a song that maybe a teen could relate to with the themes of indivuality and what not, but it seems a bit pretensious and a tad corny.  It's not as catchy as the first two tracks.<br /><br />Back to the Stone Age - It's corny, but in a Alice Cooper kinda way.  Catchy riff and solid drumming and Gene does a couple of powerful screams, similar to the one he lets out at the end of Deuce.  Not too shabby for a tune that could potentially be the next Flinstones theme.<br /><br />Shout Mercy - Cool Song.  Catchy, Groovy, with a lot of swagger.  Paul sounds awesome.<br /><br />Long Way Down - Best song on the album!  Paul sounds excellent and his lyrics are awesome.  All the riffs are great and they make the song flowy yet groovy.  Eric Singer makes good use of his cowbell.<br /><br />Eat Your Heart Out - Can't get into this one.  It's kinda lame from the get go and never builds momentum.  Definite filler song.<br /><br />The Devil is Me - Gene sounds mean in this tune.  Heavy and provocative with some thick guitar work.  Potential KISS concert staple song.<br /><br />Outta This World - Tommy, you are not Ace, so don't try...<br /><br />All For the Love of Rock and Roll - Sound like a John Cougar Mellencamp song...I can't get through this song without getting a bit of nausea.  Not a KISS song in my book.<br /><br />Take Me Down Below - The lyrics are hysterical!  Similar to something off of Rock and Roll Over or Dressed to Kill.  The guitar riff has a straight forward AC/DCish quality, but it makes for a great, hooky tune.<br /><br />Last Chance - The Party Song!  Definitely would work on a party mix!  I could dance to it!  Great final track.<br /><br />In closing, Eric and Tommy need to stay off the mic and not try to be the Peter and Ace carbon copies.  If their songs were deleted, this album would be superb.
1843913720|5.0|I don't think I've ever read a book where the title so sums up what the book is all about. The story is set in Sweden and is about the life and adventures of our hero Allan Karlsson who on his hundredth birthday climbed out the window of his old people's home and disappeared.  He then sets out on a journey where he steals a suitcase which turns out to contain a fortune that was paid over to a group of bikers by a Russian organized crime syndicate as payment for a drug deal. There then follows an unlikely but very amusing story of drug dealers trying to track the money down and the police starting a nationwide hunt for Allan after a warrant is issued for a triple murder. As the book progresses,  Allan collects a motley crew of really interesting but flawed characters plus an elephant, that somehow all manage to stay one step ahead of the police for much of the book. The book is also interspersed with flashbacks of Allan's life and how he inadvertently managed to be in the right place at the wrong time and helped influence a number of events and changed the course of twentieth century history.<br />This book is pure entertainment as far as I am concerned. I wouldn't say I was finding myself exploding into fits of hysterical laughter as I read the book. However, I found myself smiling as I turned the pages and couldn't help but chuckle at some of the situations that Allan and his group of friends found themselves in. A great feel good book that I would recommend to anybody.
0316228532|3.0|I tried to read this book with no preconceived ideas about what JK Rowling might write. Judged on its own merit independent of the HP series, this book is DARK. Rape, drug addition, seriously disturbed characters,viscous family relations, compulsion disorders around pedophilia, self inflicted cutting... this is not a light read. There are more messed up teens and parents in this small town than seems humanly possible. If that's the point that everyone is a hypocrite and has a hidden agenda, then she made that point well. That being said, the writing was sharp, the intertwined lives of the characters well conceived, the depiction of the town was vivid, but I found that I had to will myself to finish the book, mostly because there are really no sympathetic characters in the whole lot of them. You end up alternating between feelings of intense dislike mixed with pity for most of the characters and that fact kept me from really enjoying the book. I feel like I survived a 3 day ordeal just by finishing. My conclusion is that JK Rowling is a very perceptive writer with a sharp grasp of people's character flaws, but deep down I wished she'd touched upon some redeeming features of humanity. I felt like I needed a shower after finishing this book. Sure, she brings up many important social issues but you have to prepare yourself for a bleak few hundred pages. Whatever comedy there is more along the lines of \\"funny/sad\\" not funny/funny.

0446563048|4.0|I love Zappos and continue to be \\"wow'd\\" by their customer service and playful spirit.

B007THA4FI|4.0|I have just read Casual Vacancy and while I enjoyed it some of the english words were confusing. I am waiting for the next book by her.
B003AJUHKQ|4.0|The CG animation look cool but distract from this classic. They're style doesn't fit with the rest of the movie.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|What can I say. This game is fun. Nothing techie about it. Just simple mindless bliss. Fun Fun Fun Fun Fun!!!!!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Nice twist on the usual gem matching games. Having a goal of moving target tiles to the bottom is refreshing. I can see it getting to hard pretty soon; but a challenge is good.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|i had seen nothing but great reviews on the knife so I ordered one for my brother,  but like it so much I got one for myself and what a monster it is,  one ton of heft so belt carry is so so, seath is nice but something to lock it in  would up it's value like with my k-bar sheth, I butoned some realy hard dryed out wood in my back yard and it did a good job but the coating was showing some ware and some chiping showed on the blade tip, but hay the wood was so dry I might as well have been cutting through a rock. a few swipe of sharpining stone and it came right out.<br /><br />would I recommend this knife to a friend? Yep! although I have come to the conclusion that it would surve a better knife in a bug out bag if anything, not a great belt carryer so you may want to head for sometghing like SCHF3N or somthing in a Kbar. all in all a hugh high value knife
B0072OFM28|5.0|Absolutley love the whole saprtacus series, so did my wife. So said about Liam McIntyre. We will miss you brother and thanks, God speed (we salute you) . My sympathy to his wife and loved ones. Seller was great. Arrived on time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is fun but a little much money.  they will make a creeper amount of money. I am sick and play the xbox version of this game. Thanks for reading (-:
B007THA4FI|4.0|There's a large number of characters and that you get to know as each chapter or section moves on, this is enjoyable, you become involved in people you can believe in. The build up of the story is slow and precise, soon you're living in the fictional world and are less and less surprised as the characters unfold. My only disappointment is that the end came - well, too close to the end. I'd have liked to approach the end of the story more slowly, to have had more time to revel in it.<br /><br />This is a long book and a complicated cast of characters to relate to, it's not a quick, easy airline read, it's a holiday book that requires time and concentration. And it's very enjoyable.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I love these books. Amazing stories, amazing characters. A fabulous author. So grateful to have found such an awesome series.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I love historial fiction- if factual and well written.  Ken Follett is a master at this.  I would have liked a few more words about whar happened at Midway, as that battle was probably the turning point of WW2.  Also I think the starvation in St. Petersberg, the siege of Stalingrad and the tank battle at Kurz could have been fit into the story.  All in all  I loved the book and at times found that I could not put it down.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|One of my most favorite books, why... because I need it, and it lifts me up, and helps me capture the attitude I need, to move forward, we call it inspiration, thank you sir!<br /><br />I am not per se a writer, but anyone who does creative work, can get the lessons and inspiration from this book, it is one of my favorite books.  The Road Less Traveled is the other one, but for a different reason they are unique with how they seem to speak to the mind and heart.  I read this one repeatedly to reawaken the attitude I need to overcome \\"resistance\\".<br /><br />Vanquish \\"resistance\\" and make the world a brighter place, by inspiring others by your humble unrelenting example.
B004TTHLBE|4.0|Every chapter on my Kindle Keyboard begins with this:<br /><br />\\"There is video content at this location<br />that is not currently supported for your<br />device. Caption for this video is displayed<br />below.\\"<br /><br />If there's a caption, then I don't need to know about the video, at all. And I certainly don't need to be reminded that there's video that I cannot watch AT EVERY CHAPTER.<br /><br />The original content is a book; don't irritate me with useless additions every 30 pages.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's 5 stars, minus one star for bad editing/publishing.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Lengthy and satisfying. A good level of difficulty so as to be challenging without being frustrating. Worth the buy for sure. Looking forward to the sequel.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Interesting topic, and perhaps all the personal history was needed, but that made the reading choppy. Certainly the Seals are an impressive group with a proud record.
B0098WWEH8|4.0|This new album holds up to the Grizzly Bear standard. I've listened to it countless times now and still love it.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I got it as the free app of the day, and it's great and pretty for being free. Not sure I would pay $4.99 for it... maybe $1.99... Overall smooth game play, nice graphics, and no bugs so far. A good buy.
B009FZZFME|1.0|Normally, I would be getting my Walking Dead from AMC directly...however circumstances beyond my control have left it to Amazon and they have failed miserably. If I buy a TV pass, then I should be able to watch it the night they premiere, not some 4 minute documentary on how they made the zombies. REALLY? This blows!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book gives a lot of insight as to what constitutes the makeup of a Seal and how they took down Osama bin Laden.  Very interesting read.
B008EL25LE|3.0|I actually liked the variations on a match three game even tho the bugs drove me nuts. the replay factor is good but it's a short game.  make sure you select more and do a profile first.  it took me too long to realize that you can pick your active and passive powerups for each game. if the price was lower I would have rated it 4 stars.
B0095R64AO|3.0|It had its funny moments, but was just too long.  If not for Jason Segel, I would not have given it a chance.  He was hilarious in Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  Much better movie than this one.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Too many characters,  plot is confusing and doesn't seem to flow together with all the different scenarios going on.  Lost interest<br />but will finish it eventually.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of my absolute favorite books, hands down. Makes you feel every emotion possible and it's an original story. I feel like even though the story is told from the point of view of Charlie, the main character, that you still get an idea of what every other character is like as well, and I love that.
B009CPEOC4|5.0|Katy perry, is a wonderful young artist who proves to be the next Madonna ! In the film she plays as herself and shows how it all started to just karaoke in a bar to trying to get a label for her career.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Not really a story line, nothing to solve, just go from level to level matching 3jewels games.  Good graphics seems stable, not excessive permissions, pretty big though 45meg.. Knowing Amazon,  this is going to be the best one we see for a while
B008B11R1Q|3.0|Nice music. I did enjoy the XX's debut more. Coexist had a bare-bones feel to it. Even so, it made me feel all feely inside. The singers have sweet angel voices. If I have trouble sleeping, I'll listen to the album.
B008XG1X18|4.0|i love pinrest. app awesome. easy to browse. better than mobile site.<br />it does crash on my kindle fire sometimes.
B000M06K5C|4.0|Fantastic album. Sweet vocals and amazing instrumentals. The CD has an overall cool, chill vibe. I would recommend it. Drive while listening at night. It will change your life.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was not going to read the fifty shades books but someone I work with asked me if I had read them and I said no. She then said I really needed to read them and I am glad she did.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Our entire family 12-42 loved this movie. Including one female - me!  :)I didn't know a lot of the Marvel comics before, so you can still enjoy without having the background.
0316227706|5.0|Have seen the photographer's photos online and ordered a few copies right away knowing I would give them away as gifts. It has been a hit with my animal lover and photographer friends. Makes an amazing gift.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|It is dark version of Snow White, definitely.  It wasn't horrible, didn't have much language. Not something I would watch again, but didn't regret renting it.  May have regretted paying the high price of seeing it in the theater.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I hadn't read anything from Blake Crouch prior to reading Pines.  As a first introduction to this gifted, complex and slightly twisted author, I didn't know what to expect.  As the story moved deeper into the absurd and creepy, I found myself genuinely concerned for the protagonist, alarmed at his suffering and turning each page faster and faster to make sure that he ended up ok in the end.<br /><br />Since discovering Crouch, I have read several others of his books voraciously.  I have NEVER read horror before and don't care for Stephen King, etc.  But Blake has a way of humanizing the characters so well that you are compelled to like them even when you know you shouldn't.  Even the most grotesque, evil characters make a connection with the reader in a way that makes you cheer for them.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I was expecting a lot in the form of clarity when purchasing this set and Lucas went above and beyond and exceeded my expectations.  The picture quality of this set is truly amazing.  Of course the sound is also superb.  If all you care about is seeing Star Wars looking and sounding better than ever before then get this set.  If you want more than that then just read other reviews since there are so many negatives because of \\"They didn't include this\\" or \\"They didn't fix that.\\"
B008MEM24S|5.0|As a fan of both Agent P and Where's My Water I was excited to try this theme game. It does not disappoint. Thoughtful fun with a nice dash of Phineas and Ferb humour. Turn on the Party-inator and let the good times flow (through a vaccum tube, of course)!
B0098VXBIA|3.0|It has a few cute moments, but for the most part, the film is very blah.  I am glad I watched it, but if I never saw it again, that would be okay with me.
B008MJGQ0O|4.0|If you've been listening to John Abercrombie for a while or have even a smattering of his considerable output over the past many years, especially as a leader, this one may strike you as something different.<br /><br />I heard an anecdote of the brilliant young turk who played for the master and played the score note for note flawlessly. When the master played the same notes the music came to life in a way the young man could not duplicate. When asked the difference the master replied: You don't love every note. On this release John Abercrombie and Joe Lovano do love every note.  Nothing is wasted, nothing is forced. It is contemplative. The tempos are all slow to moderate, though never ponderous.<br /><br />The last collaboration of these two that I'm aware of was on JA's 1999 \\"Open Land\\" where Lovano put in an appearance with John's working quartet of the time. This outing gives the two a chance to interact directly and share their love and respect for the music.<br /><br />John is still playing guitar with his thumb, a technique he adopted in the mid-90s and has not abandoned since. (And he has never come off sounding like Wes.) That soft attack has possibly never been better balanced than in this interplay with Lovano's rich, lingering sax. But JA's guitar is so soft in the mix, if  you didn't know better, at first hearing you might take this for a Joe Lovano release with JA sitting in.  It almost sounds like John, so often the leader, wants to take a back seat, let the guitar come to the music from below and let the sax sail over top. Too often in this recording I find myself wondering \\"Where's John?\\" He's so low in some parts of the mix Joey Barron's light cymbal taps almost drown him out. That may be the \\"something different\\" in this release and I find myself wishing for just a hint of the dynamic of the earlier collaboration.
B008RYN44U|5.0|This is the greatest album No Doubt has ever created since 1995's Tragic Kingdom. With a suprisingly new sound and message in the songs, No Doubt still has the same fun and animated lyrics only Gwen Stefani can deliver. This will be a CD you will want to listen to over and over again.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I would never have picked up this book, had it not been for my 13-year-old nephew, who named \\"The Hunger Games\\" his favorite series of all times. I'm a fan of literary fiction, weaned on Jane Austen, so what are the chances I'd be hooked? Well, I stayed up until 3 a.m. to finish the first installment and bought the next two immediately. Amazing. Katniss Everdeen is one of the strongest and most memorable female characters ever written, right up there with Elizabeth Bennett. Fortunately, there's no silly romantic ending to this tale. Katniss doesn't have time to date--she's too busy trying to save the world.
B0053O89RY|4.0|Modern Family is a great show, one of the best on TV at the moment IMHO. I thoroughly enjoyed the first two seasons so naturally I would want the third. There are definitely some memorable episodes this season. Phil and Cam remain my favorite characters and my least favorite, Luke, seemed to noticably improve. However, I wouldn't say season 3 is on par with the previous two, and I'm not exactly sure why that is. Perhaps it's the change in the actress who plays Lilly, maybe it was due to Cam & Mitch and Phil & Claire getting into arguements practically every ep, or perhaps it's just that I enjoyed more eps in the prior seasons than this one; I don't know but there it is. I would recommend this show to anyone who likes good old-fashioned family television because there's something for everybody in it, especially if you've seen at least some of the show already but not yet S3. I can say that this is the season that 'stole the show' as it were with awards, and also why they all received a salary increase for season 4; I just hope they can keep up the quality.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The fact that a book becomes a runaway bestseller tends to make me avoid it (just stubborn that way), so \\"Hunger Games\\" was never on my to-read list. And then my 13-year-old nephew named it his favorite series of all time. So, in order to keep in touch with the younger generation, I started reading. And stayed up until 3 a.m. to finish. And ordered the next two books immediately, finishing THEM in two days. It's hard to describe how a combination of \\"Survivor\\" and \\"Lord of the Flies\\" could be such a gripping adventure, especially for a Jane Austen fan like me. All I can say is, \\"Hang on!\\"
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|more entertaining than I thought it would be.  I didn't realize I could sell prizes until I stumbled on that option by accident, so maybe instructions would be helpful, but other than that a fairly enjoyable time waster
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Kids with cancer? What a gutsy book. Loved it. Funny (in a gallows-humor kind of way) and beautifully written, especially considering that the author is a 30-year-old man, speaking as a 16-year-old girl. I will long remember Hazel Grace, Augustus and Isaac. Hint: Don't try to finish this book in a public place, such as a doctor's office, or people will wonder what's wrong with you (and why you're crying).
0316017930|5.0|This book was really interesting.  There were so many different stories throughout the whole book.  References to Rice Paddies, the smartest man in the world (IQ wise), Bill Gates, and the author's own story (to name a few).  I though the author did a nice job of reference studies/research done in conjunction with these stories - not to mention the information is provided if you want to go read the research yourself.<br /><br />I was already starting to read a book on the \\"10,000 hour\\" principle, although it was a harder read.  This book is easier to read.  Some of the chapters do reference earlier chapters, but I think you can jump in at any chapter and get it.  The version of the book that I purchased also included questions if you are part of a reading group.<br /><br />I'm not going to get in to the details of exactly what he covers because I don't want to spoil it, but, I'm sure you have looked around at people near you and thought \\"How did that guy become a Manager?\\"  \\"How did Donald Trump get all that money and be where he is?\\"  \\"That guy is super book-smart - why is he in that position?\\"  This book may confirm your theory, and if not, you may look at those people differently next time.<br /><br />I recommend the book - in fact - I may pick up another book from this author.<br />Enjoy!
0316212377|4.0|It's 25 years since Iain M Banks introduced us to the utopian \\"Culture\\" series of sci fi adventure books and \\"The Hydrogen Sonata\\" is the 13th in the series. One thing Banks does particularly well is to make his books completely accessible as stand alones, explaining the concept afresh each time without going over old ground for long time fans, of which there are many. In many ways, this is a good introduction for those who have yet to discover the joys of this excellent series because it's far more linear than some. He sometimes leaves even hardened \\"Culture\\" addicts struggling to work out what's going on with alternative realities before bringing them together, but there's little of that here.<br /><br />At his best, Banks brings exciting plots, dry and sarcastic humour and thoughtful observations of a socio-political nature about how civilizations manage themselves and about faith in particular as well as looking at the benefits and losses of progress. All of those ingredients are here, with the main theme, following on from his last book in the series \\"Surface Detail\\" which was concerned with what we might term hell, turning to something he's addressed before - the \\"sublimation\\" of a civilization, the Gzilt, whereby they leave the real world in exchange for immateriality. Heaven if you like.<br /><br />Naturally this is a momentous event as a whole civilization ends its existence leading to partying before hand and scavenging for the technical advances afterwards. When a secret revelation threatens this process, self-interest and war aren't far behind.<br /><br />And yet for all that, it left me less enthusiastic than I was expecting and it's not, for me, the best of the series. In fairness people will debate strongly which book they like the best and the first one they read will often sit fairly high up on the list and it depends a bit on which aspect of the books appeals to you most. What's strange is that one of the things I love most about the books is the humour of the sentient ships and there's a lot of that here. In fact, the Culture ships feature rather more strongly than the often do in the books. While they do offer all the usual dry sarcasm we have come to expect from them, and many come with some terrific names (although even here they are less imaginative than usual), something just didn't seem right with the overall balance.<br /><br />Perhaps it's relative lack of \\"human\\" (bio is a better word) characters to contrast with and perhaps it's just that the story isn't quite as exciting as usual. In fact, it's all a little predictable how things are going to work out. It's a very enjoyable book, as ever with Iain M Banks, but it just didn't have that \\"I cannot put this book down\\" quality that he often evokes.<br /><br />There's still much to enjoy though. The title itself relates to one of the few bios who is trying to complete a piece of music perfectly before she undergoes the sublimation. Popularly known as \\"The Hydrogen Sonata\\", its full name is \\"TC Vilabier's 26th String-Specific Sonata For An Instrument Yet To Be Invented\\". If that's your type of humour, you will very much enjoy the \\"Culture\\" series.<br /><br />It's far from an unlucky 13th for the reader. All the ingredients are the same and it's good, but somehow the ratio of components just isn't quite right somehow. Despite the theme, it isn't quite \\"sublime\\", although few do space opera better than Banks.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I don't understand the negative reviews of this book. I can imagine readers who don't enjoy reading Reacher novels, but don't understand why Reacher fans wouldn't enjoy this book. It is lean and to the point. Reacher is hitchhiking, Reacher gets pulled into a situation where his unique skills are called for, Reacher takes care of business, Reacher walks off into the sunset. Sure, it follows a formula -- that's the whole point of these books.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This was kind of slow getting started but the more you read,the faster you turn the pages...I admit I enjoyed the book somewhat,and I loved the twists & turns which really kept the reader guessing;HOWEVER,the ending is so abrupt,its like the author just got tired of writing and suddenly quit....Don't care for that type of ending...so,OK book but left you frustrated with the end.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game.  some strategy is required with a little luck thrown in.  can't beat the heartbeat acceleration when you get a puzzle piece or a level up.  a+ on this one
B005COO1X6|4.0|I admit I have a love/hate relationship with Stephen King...sometimes I love his stories,sometimes I hate them....this one is a winner...held my attention from the get go...Kept reminding me of Christine...Way to go King!
B009AJDDQU|1.0|Haven't seen the movie. It would never run over my roku even though it is a model Amazon claims will work. The customer service is ill equipped and had no idea how to get it working and then they promised follow-up that never was sent. When it works it works, when it doesn't Amazon has no plan to help.
B0091THDOM|5.0|Not exactly sure about the reviews stating it doesn't fit the new iPhone 5.  I have the new iPhone 5 in the white and I have this exact sleeve in the cell phone pocket of my purse.  My iPhone 5 fits this sleeve perfectly and the \\"helper tab\\" is elasticized to help pull the phone out of the sleeve if need be.  This sleeve is very nicely made and I'm very pleased with the my purchase.  I'm a person that loves a naked iPhone and I particularly love the protection of a sleeve when carrying it in my purse.  I chose the distressed brown color and think it's beautiful.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|The title should be plural. The story builds to a sort of lone wolf metaphor at the end, but it takes place in a world dominated by real wolves; blood-thirty beasts who hunt and kill mercilessly a small group of testosterone-filled oil drillers stranded in the middle of a cold and snowy nowhere after a plane crash. It's a tale of survival, albeit a familiar one, held together not by precious dialogue or clever plotting; the men just trod along; but by a mesmerizing sense of impending doom created by the technical know-how of director Joe Carnahan. He fails in his characterization of the wolves; they seem unrealistically menacing with their sudden horror-movie-like attacks; and directors need to learn that movies like this don't need family flashbacks; we can assume that people who are stranded in the woods and probably going to die soon miss their former lives; but he does well with the people, namely Liam Neeson as leader John Ottway.<br /><br />marcellee.com

B000FC1HBY|5.0|This whole book series is simply amazing. Well written, good character development, twisting plot lines that make you want to shout and cheer all at the same time... and I love that the little bit of \\"fantasy\\" isn't overdone so it's believable. I am seriously impressed with the series, and book 2 is my favorite of the first 3.

B009AJDDQU|5.0|This prequel was one of the best ones. It truly explains so much. The idea and thought that was put into this and brought together especially from all of the other Alien movies to also include the Alien vs. Predator movies, was very well done. I never thought about something like this. Fun, suspenseful, and exciting, great film, definite recommendation.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is by far the best Marvel Super Hero Movie yet! It was fun for the whole family, we had to rewind some parts just to watch them again because of how good they were. I love the combo pack, you get so much out of it for your money, it is well worth it. I would recommend anyone to order this copy over any other.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|This movie was just terrible.  Even if we'd been able to stream it for free I would still be here writing a negative review...alas, I paid $4 for this stinker.  The previews did a fair job of \\"selling\\" the movie, but, honestly, the two scenes in the previews that made us chuckle are not even funny when seen in the context of the movie.  Johnny Depp is brilliant as Jack Sparrow (and in so many other roles), so we hoped that that same subtly smarmy charisma would be evident in this movie.  Sadly, there's nothing subtle about his character, Barney, in this film...he's just plain smarmy.<br /><br />The violence (Barney is a vampire, after all, and he does feed on people) is unnecessary and decidedly NOT funny.  Yes, I get it...it's a dark comedy.  And it is dark...it's just not very funny.  If Barney's disregard for human life was intended to add depth to his character in some way, then it failed.  Instead, it made me just not like him much at all.<br /><br />I was also suprised by the sexual content...nothing graphic, mind you, just inappropriate for younger kids.  I came within seconds of turning it off and not allowing my 14 yo to watch the rest of the movie.  Under current \\"standards,\\" the movie isn't exactly rated R, but it's just too offensive to be comfortably in the PG-13 camp.  It saddens me that the \\"powers that be\\" in the MPAA consider material like this suitable for kids as young as 13!  And I'm sorry I can't provide any solid examples from the movie...I've just spent the past two days purging it from my head. =D<br /><br />So unless you are a HUGE fan of the Johnny Depp/Tim Burton/Helena Bonham Carter team, I suggest you skip this one.  And certainly don't let your kids (mid-teen or younger) watch it!
B007THA4FI|3.0|I enjoyed this story but found the number of characters confusing especially in the first half of the book. Still worth the read  !!

B008NB0SQO|1.0|As much as normally disdain these types of \\"reviews\\", I feel consumers should be warned that this upcoming Blu-ray will feature ONLY the shorter Theatrical Cut of \\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\\". It will NOT feature the song \\"When Love Is Gone\\", which I feel is critical to the character development of Ebenezer Scrooge. I, personally, will not purchase this film again until Disney restores this scene to future releases of the film, starting with the Blu-ray.<br /><br />I have given this a 1-star review so that studio will recognize the disservice that they are doing to fans of this film - but the film itself deserves 5 stars. If, and when, Disney releases the complete version - it will be deserving of the highest possible praise.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have always liked playing this game. It is pretty entertaining and can't get bored from it. This one provided by Amazon with its partners is a great value for me to use on the go. It has several options and strategy versions that I can go on for hours playing it.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|it's remarkable that this bold, authentic and progressive collection from DK should be tagged as commercial. She could make so much more money churning out more middle of the road classics for fans that can't get enough of the more mainstream jazz arrangements, and DK could stifle her creativity and adventurous spirit for that reason. If you want to understand this collection you need to understand T Bone better and listen to other people he has worked with, it's a journey worth making and gives the right context for this collection, which in my view is a masterpiece of Americana and takes up where The Girl in the Other Room left off. You can play me anything she does and I'll want to come visit again :-)
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well written.  It appears to provide a good account of the mission to find and capture Osama Bin Laden without making the author appear as the hero.  He is basically telling the story to ensure the correct story is told versus the incorrect accountings that have been published by others without first hand knowledge.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very intriguing.  Couldn't put it down.  At times it made you feel a little uncomfortable, but you got by that with the good story line. Would definately recommend.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|well worth the $. can be graphic at times so careful if you play with kids looking over your shoulder.
