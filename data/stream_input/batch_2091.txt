B005C9YZKU|5.0|I have always loved nature programs and grew up watching Nature, Nova and the such on PBS as a kid. My brother owned a VHS set of another nature series narrated and presented by David Attenborough back in the 1990s so I already knew David does a wonderful job of narration. When I came across this limited edition I knew I just had to have it. My boyfriend bought it as a Christmas gift for me soon thereafter.<br /><br />As appearances go, this globe is a great conversation piece all in itself. It comes in a clear plastic box. Upon removal from the packaging, opening the globe you see all of the discs partially raised up in their individual sleeves placed in their own slots. Even while opened it has a visual appeal to it that one can appreciate. The inside of the globe top has a scenic view of the sky, peering up through the trees. The detail of this globe is something I am proud to own, as a dvd collector.<br /><br />As for the dvd's themselves, the footage speaks for itself. Absolutely spectacular! I played these dvd's on my surround sound system and was completely blown away. The crashing waves, the wind, the sounds of nature and all of it's fascinatingly diverse creatures left me not only in awe but it gave me a more profound respect for the natural world that is all around us.<br /><br />The vibrant colors, the sound quality, the care for detail not only from the dvd's but the globe display itself all come together as a wonderful package that I would absolutely recommend to anyone who appreciates nature and appreciates quality decor items that add to a room's &#34;personality&#34;, so to speak.<br /><br />And nothing beats the narration of David Attenborough!<br /><br />I highly recommend this limited edition.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|I have always thought the idea of zombies to be stupid. The concept was lame, impossible and cheesy at best. When my boyfriend &#34;made&#34; me watch zombie movies I did everything I could to hold back laughter. It was just that dumb, in my opinion.<br /><br />Then one day this new television show began to air called The Walking Dead. The hype, to me, was just another zombiefest riding on a new generational obsession. Check back in with me in 15 more years when the next generation hypes it up again. Like waves on the beach, fads do come and go. Come back, go .. wash, rinse and repeat.<br /><br />Then my Mom watched the show. I felt defeated. Outnumbered. I now had two people pressing the issue telling me to tune in. I didn't wanna .. and I didn't do it. Season One came and went. I don't know how it happened but one day during the long Summer break I gave in to my boyfriend's persistence. I sat down with him and watched one episode of the Season One dvd set I had bought him as a gift. Then another episode, then the third .. I realized that day there was something different about this zombie craze. But I still resisted!<br /><br />Weeks went by and I did not pick up where we left off. Eventually though, I found myself flipping through cable channels at night or on the weekends and would see The Walking Dead reruns on. I would just keep it on there .. you know, for background noise. By the time season two came on I was hooked and had been highly anticipating the return of Rick and Shane for weeks.<br /><br />I now watch every single episode the moment they come on. The first night of this most recent season my cable provider did not offer us AMC due to a contract dispute (yes, I was one of the helpless victims caught in the middle). I found myself hitting &#34;refresh&#34; every five seconds trying my best to get AMC's one-time free airing of The Walking Dead to load on their website for those of us who were with the ill reputed cable service provider. While I missedthe first 20 minutes of that episode, I found myself laughing at my desperation. Of all things, I was freaking out over not getting to watch zombies.<br /><br />By that following weekend, I canceled service with my cable provider and switched over to a competitor. The very next day I found out my former cable provider finally cut a deal with AMC and they got my zombies back. I didn't care, though. I was more than happy to go elsewhere to a provider that would not take away my zombie show due to their own financial issues. I cannot risk it .. not ever again!<br /><br />As for The Walking Dead and what keeps me on the edge of my seat for more .. I cannot get enough of the characters, the story plots, the emotion. While the possibility of zombies can still be passionately debated (I still laugh at the thought) what took hold of me and jerked me right into the vortex of what can only be described as one of THE best television shows ever is the way these people become a part of your life. No, I'm not setting a spot at the dinner table for Rick (although i would love to!). All the important elements that make for amazingly wonderful television and entertainment is right here within this show.<br /><br />For the first time since I was a kid I am excited to tune in and watch a show that is so worth my time and my love. It really doesn't get much better than this.

1616550414|5.0|I wanted to give the book 5 stars, I know that many may already know that it does talk about Skyward Sword more than any of the other games but the book still offers a lot of drawings and insight into the Zelda games and their history. I even learned some things I didn't know and I'm huge fan of the Zelda series and have all the games (except the two Zelda games for the Gameboy color the Oracle of Ages and the Oracle of Seasons which I hope are offered on Virtual Console for the 3DS eventually if they are not already). The book is very well made the pages are thick and the images are vivid with color, and whether you are new to the series or not I believe you would enjoy this book for the price it is.

B009VB97EY|5.0|Okay seriously, I refused to watch this movie for the longest time.. I was like oh no, this is so silly. But I gave in cause it was steven soderbergh so I had to watch it, twice ! ha..  I liked it a lot. Really enjoyed this film. From the acting, to cinematography, the look and feel. And holy smoke the performances of these 'strippers' where really nice to watch. Magic Mike blew my mind, he really danced amazing. I thought it was a great film. Its nice to see finally men taking off some of their clothes instead of women.<br />Yep, I can recommend this film !
0399536108|5.0|I purchased this book The Art of Non-Conformity after hearing rave reviews about the World Domination Summit Chris had founded & organized. After browsing his website & understanding that his mission aligned well with mine, I couldn't wait to pick up his book. I opened the box, sat down & read front to back until I was complete. I found myself nodding yes throughout the entire work, while also scribbling down questions and considerations to mull over later. This was a thoughtful, well written work, & I insist everyone read this book, just to get a peek at what can be possible.

B009NYF2ES|5.0|I give the movie itself 5 stars, but I remember getting the DVD and the sound was tinny and flat.  It was 1972, I know, but many movies at this time have way better sound. A musical with bad sound is, well, not so great.  Maybe it was just filmed that way, I don't know.  So, has anyone bought the new Blu-ray version, and how's the sound?  Please comment.
0765325950|5.0|Have long awaited the end to this series, and was not in the least bit disappointed. I found Brandon Sanderson more than up to the task of completing this beloved series, even going so far as to say he breathed a bit of life into it as well. I now consider him one of my favorite authors, and have read and will continue to read everything he writes. The story wraps up nearly prefectly, all loose ends are tied up, and doesn't sugar coat the consequences of the last battle at all. Absolutely worth reading, though I imagine any wot time reader would need no review, as they have probably already read it.
B006VKKAWQ|5.0|I have always considered Toscanini to be the ultimate classical conductor, which very few others can approach. However, many of his records have been very difficult to find.  This collection of remastered CD's is superb!  The producers of this set have done a great service

0893860468|5.0|Its difficult to find words to describe the depths to which this book will take you. In a nutshell, this book teaches you to be your own guru. It teaches you to trust in yourself, that you are the ultimate reality. For those READY to ingest the seeds sown by N. Maharaj, you will NEVER be the same. Take note... this book is very deep! And one can easily get lost by his words... it even amazes me a man with no formal education can come up with such profound depth !! Take your time when you are reading this book... its one of those books you can literally meditate on EVERY sentence he speaks. I get goosebumps reading it. No one needs to convince you this is a realized man. To be frank...out of all the MANY books i have read, N Maharaj is probably one of the very few people that i believe was TRULY realized ! That said, i also need to state this might not be a book for every. Some of the concepts raised in this book requires that you already have a certain level of understanding (spiritually). for example i see this book being useless to someone who has never meditated before or doesnt know the real meaning of meditation. Hearing N Maharaj talk about things such as silence will mean nothing to the the reader. That said, i say read it anyway... to understand this book you must put its words in action. I send you love...and wish you well on your journey.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|This book has a wonderful plot, great characters and I could hardly put it down. Many details on japan in the time of the samurai which may or may not be historically accurate, but at least some of them are. Highly recommended!
1616550414|5.0|As soon as I heard there was an English version of this coming out I had to buy it for my little brothers. They both were ecstatic when they opened up their gifts. This book has not only beautiful pictures of just about every character worth noting in all of the Zelda games but it also has a lot of information that one would not normally see. They both commented that they loved the section on enemies not included in the game, and my youngest brother is really into graphic novels and loved the one included at the end of this book.<br /><br />Pros-<br />Great visuals<br />Everything you would want to know about Zelda<br />Sturdy well put together book<br /><br />Cons-<br />They waited until 2013 to make the English version<br /><br />For the price you should get this for any loved ones who are Zelda fans.
0765325950|4.0|A mixed bag... After all of the torturous years following the story and its infinite supply of characters the author tries to tie up the loose ends and give us some sense of closure. The execution is not always masterful but it is relatively satisfying. Loose ends still abound and many may feel that their favorite characters deserve more attention than they received.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is a fantastic book. I fell in love with Lincoln and all the other main characters. I was ashamed that I knew so little of the story beforehand, but reading it has invigorated my interest in history and current affairs. Thank you Doris Kearns Goodwin!

B008Y5OWMK|5.0|Is Heaven's Gate the worst movie ever made? Absolutely not! The history behind this massive studio &#34;failure&#34; is content enough for a movie, but that's another story.<br /> Heavens Gate, at it's best, is a sweeping, grand and often beautifully shot epic film. It has an able cast, a terrific score, and an engaging storyline. At it's worst, it suffers from some technical problems, not the least of which is the sound recording during various portions, and a somewhat muddy storyline, The original length is what began its failure. Cimino was forced to cut the movie down initially which served only to amplify the somewhat difficult to follow storyline. Word of mouth about this initial cut snowballed the disaster into an avalanche...and the rest is history.<br />But do not dismay, what you have here in this restored version is the original intent. I think it is, in fact, a masterpiece, a flawed masterpiece, but still a tremendous movie. Yes, it will take some time for the movie to unfold, but it is a worthwhile experience.

B00A81MV3U|4.0|If you want to get rock hard abs from laughing, fall in love with endearing characters with personality disorders, and learn how to salvage your sanity all at the same time, Silver Linings Playbook will give you the game plan you need. This unconventionally charming comedy is clever and shocking. The characters are as lovable as they are deranged, and the overall message is sweet.<br /><br />Pat Solatono (Bradley Cooper) has lost everything after a bipolar breakdown sent him to a mental institution for eight months. Once he gets out, he clings to positivity, determined to rebuild his life and salvage his marriage despite a restraining order. He moves back in with his concerned but loving parents. His father (Robert DeNiro) wants to use his obsession with Philadelphia Eagles football to reconnect with his son, while his mother (Jacki Weaver) wants to use her Sunday football snacks to fix the situation.<br /><br />When Pat meats Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a hot mess herself, she throws Pat onto a different route to recovery. When she offers to help him contact his wife in exchange for helping her on a special project, silver linings show up in both of their lives.<br /><br />I'm not knowledgeable about personality disorders myself, so I would be easily fooled if Bradley Cooper's performance was subpar, but Cooper apparently immersed himself in a ton of research to accurately portray his role as a man fighting his bipolar disorder. He was quick and witty and his character was as unfiltered as tapwater. His research paid off as his portrayal of Pat was seamless.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence was the perfect misfit by his side. She dominates every scene is was in. Her scathing humor was powerful and believable. But at the same time, she allows the audience to catch glimpses of her sweet and tender disposition that underlies her harsh exterior. She adds playful dynamics to their relationship because while Pat is concerned with rebuilding and bettering himself, Tiffany has accepted and embraced all her flaws and shortcomings.<br /><br />The greatest thing about this film was how it created humor from circumstances that would be irredeemably dysfunctional in the real world. That breed of humor straddles a feeble line between being hilarious and being offensive. Silver Linings Playbook nailed it. I laughed at scenes that would have caused crocodile tears in other movies. The humor would have been delightful on its own, but to make it especially brilliant, it's symbolic. For every scene of panic attacks, physical altercations, and verbal abuse, there was humor- a silver lining.<br /><br />I left the theatre feeling a little bit insane, only because I felt so sane. I feel like the next time I'm crippled by real pain, I will be able to find something beautiful about it. Maybe we could all use a few weeks in an asylum. Maybe the people there know something we don't know. Maybe they're better at seeing silver linings.

B00A2LOAKI|4.0|Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2 tells the story of how Bruce Wayne must confront the Joker, save Gotham City and go toe to toe with the Man of Steel. It's a great plot with twists and turns, good voice acting and superb orchestra. Some parts of the movie made me scratch my head.<br />Is it me or does Batman as the years go on become more stiffer and emotionless. (Huge spoiler alert) Alfred dies at the end, do we see any sympathy from Bruce Wayne.<br />In this movie, Superman is portrayed as an obedient dog, doing anything the President asks him to do. No questions are asked just done. Is this really Superman?! President says go stop the terrorist attacks, Superman says okay. It's hilarious. (Minor Spoiler Alert) Superman throws the nuke in space thus saving the day. The bomb detonates with Superman in the middle of it. Then Superman becomes a gaunt figure, falls to the Earth, then soaks the energy from the planet, and becomes normal again. That looked really cool, but what just happened?<br />Joker is a twisted, psychotic individual. In most of scenes we just see Joker killing people for no reason. In the scene where Joker enters the love triangle, he just shoots everyone. There are more creative ways of showing the dark side of Joker without having to be a mindless killing machine. One other scene was when Joker was battling Batman, he almost killed him, but the man of steel couldn't.<br />In the end it's a cool movie with some minor flaws.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it was great because it is available on my kindle fire. I have played this game before on other devices and this is fun!
0345536886|4.0|Am a big John Grisham fan, am used to his fast paced, gripping kind of tales. I was disappointed because I expected more. The 2012 novel,The Racketeer was fast paced and a real thriller. This one is more light, more on the side of a comedy. The final chapters were nail biting and great. It was dragging so much in the beginning that I almost felt like stopping. But I kept going as I thought tone may change but did not. Maybe it's the expectation. If a unknown author had written this it might have flopped. Am reading The Appeal now and it has all the ingredients of a tough novel.

B0084U0IEG|2.0|I thought Atonement was wonderful, so I expected more from McEwan than cheap plot tricks. I had to read all the way through a novel in which the female narrator sounds like a male, only to find out...well, I won't spoil it totally for you, but I found the whole thing annoying and not about anything in particular.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Though my wife thought the graphics were \\"blocky,\\" I liked that the simple geometric forms helped speed up rendering for the game. These blocks are, however, nicely colored and textured so it's not totally minimalist. My son is enthralled with this and the game's resemblance to another well-loved product (LEGO) is a plus. When you download this and open it for the first time check on the options. In my case, I disabled the \\"angry mob/creepers\\" function as I didn't want this to frustrate a budding builder before he got the hang of it. In this way his handiwork wasn't destroyed before he could proudly show it to his parents.<br /><br />Other reviewers noted the steep price (compared to other apps) and I had my son purchase this with his allowance (the money received went to his college fund). He doesn't regret the purchase at all, which is an extremely positive sign.

I wouldn't have started the series if I'd known this.<br /><br />If this doesn't bother you then you will love this series.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|The album that established The Offspring. This band's principal Greatest Hits are in this album, and other songs the which you can't miss
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is a fun game that takes more strategy than it seems when you first start to play it.  Great for all ages.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Great action movie with an all star cast. I liked this one better than part one. And you don't have to have seen part one first to understand. Skip the first one and go straight to part 2.

B004J4WLB4|4.0|I am enjoying this book. I like the back and forth progression of the story. What is disturbing is that there are no physical descriptions of the main character. You never really get a sense of her presence.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault In Our Stars deals with two young cancer patients--and so much more.  It is about the love between parents and their children, love between teenagers, and love between friends. It is about the grief that precedes loss, and the grief that follows.  It is about thoughts of the possibility of immortality, and the possibility of annihilation.<br /><br />In these and in so many other situations, John Green gets it right. In the last eighteen months, I have lost my father, mother, and husband to cancer.  Improbably, I have also fallen in love. Every few pages I was highlighting a line or a paragraph because the words expressed so precisely how I felt and what I thought.<br /><br />No wonder Time Magazine chose The Fault in our Stars as its #1 novel of 2012!
B004G606K8|5.0|I read this series back in the late 80's when at that time, the landscape of fantasy novels was relatively barren.  Then again in the mid 90's when I first started playing DnD.  My last reading, just this month, I found it aged better than I remembered and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

0802473156|5.0|It's pretty early in my reading of this one to give an extensive evaluation of it. We're reading it and believe it has some merit for couples and will help us to look at each other differently, learning to keep in mind how we each respond to love [in our own &#34;language&#34;].
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me guessing the entire time. It twists and turns and ended at a place I never saw coming. Amazing writing. Language is VERY strong, however. Just a warning if you're someone who doesn't like cursing.
B00B10ENBA|5.0|Bought and watched the first day it was released on Amazon. Great movie with an excellent cast. Bonus features were insightful.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Great book!!! The whole story line was a lot different from the movie!!! Loved it!!! The Tin Woodman was the best in the book.
B00A65FYG4|5.0|Utterly brilliant. I have to say tho, Daryl Dixon is my absolute favorite character! Cross bow weilding, motorcycle riding bad ass with a heart of pure solid gold if you ask me. Watching him feed the baby just made my heart melt.<br /><br />This show is NOT just a horror show. It is brilliantly written with character developement that puts it in the realm of instant classic. Even folks who hate or dislike horror will be roped into loving this show because it so beautifully asks the questiona,<br /><br />\\"What would you really do, if you had to? Who would you really protect, if you needed to? and how far would you go to protect the people you love, and create a real life for yourself and those people?\\"<br /><br />Utterly brilliant, poinient and scarry at various moments. Heartbreaking at other moments.<br /><br />I will say, if they kill Daryl off, i donno if i'll be able to bring myself to keep watching. I just love the character SO freakin much! But the show is brilliant. TRUST me, even if you arent a fan of horror - give it a shot! You wont be disapointed, you WILL be shocked and impressed.<br /><br />Sachi

B003TSEL7S|5.0|I LOVE LOVE this book. Rick Riordan is a great writer (one of the best) and you just must get this is you like Greek Mythology, adventure, action, and awesomeness. I would highly recommend this book. It's a 10 star book.
0143120530|5.0|If you want to not only learn but recall the information and put it to your best use possible. This book is an essential to your collection. I have read the book only once and I peruse it again and again. I learn from it as often as possible. It is a book that I will cherish in my collection and read again and again.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|This reminds me of the Disney TV shows when I was younger.  Very family friendly, with good life lessons and some laughs too.  I love the full series.  I am a big fan of the King Arthur stories - while this story has veered off of the traditional stories they still remain entertaining and enjoyable.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|I've been a diehard Josh Groban fan for over ten years now, so I was eagerly anticipating this album, as Josh likes to take a good amount of time between album releases. I seem to be in the minority of fans who truly loved his last album, 'Illuminations', and I feel that this album seems more like his earlier work in comparison, which may have been very intentional based on the decline in sales from 'Awake' to 'Illuminations' and the massive publicity blitz for this release.<br />One of my biggest criticisms of his previous albums, such as 'Closer', was that they seemed like a musical hodgepodge and not a cohesive album. In my humble opinion, 'Illuminations' got the cohesive album concept down pat, and really opened up a new, more authentic and challenging direction for Josh and his music, particularly with the emphasis on Josh's songwriting in English. This one seems like a regression in comparison, and definitely a musical hodgepodge.<br />The album opens really strongly with \\"Brave\\" and the fantastic \\"False Alarms\\", and then seems to go in a bunch of different directions.We have a Broadway cover (\\"Falling Slowly\\"), a traditional Irish air (\\"She Moved Through the Fair\\"), an Italian duet with Laura Pausini that wouldn't seem out of place on an Andrea Bocelli album (\\"E Ti Promettero\\"), a Stevie Wonder cover (\\"I Believe\\"), and many of Josh's own compositions.<br />\\"Un Alma Mas\\" was one of the highlights of the album for me; having Arturo Sandoval adds a whole new dimension to the song, and as a Spanish speaker, I'm always appreciative of Josh's work in Spanish.<br />Along with the musical hodgepodge criticism, some of the arrangements don't seem to match up with what the songs are saying to me. \\"Happy in My Heartache\\" is about the end of a relationship, but is strangely upbeat, and \\"Below the Line\\" tackles the huge issue of poverty and malnutrition, but the arrangement seems almost tropical and out of place for a song that deals with such a serious subject.<br /><br/>'All That Echoes' doesn't convey the same depth of feeling and authenticity to me that 'Illuminations' does, but I still very much enjoy Josh's singing and songwriting, and I will always be a diehard fan of his. That being said, I think he's shown us glimpses of the true depth of his talent, and we're getting fewer of them here. 'All That Echoes' is a good, but not great, album. I would still very much recommend it for the individual songs though, if not a cohesive feeling album.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent writing and character building. Hugh knows how to put you right in the story. Great read.<br /><br />Looking forward to the other stories.

B000TETKA8|5.0|I love David Bowie and have had many of his albums,cassettes,cd's etc. Had this one on CD-lost it to Superstorm Sandy! Got the download and played it right away-if you love Bowie-you'll love this music!
B002RV01Q8|5.0|Enya's well known hits and personal picks from all her studio albums to date.(Between 1986-2008). I'm sure listeners and fans alike will find plenty to rave about in here. Serious fans may wonder why some of their personal favourites were omitted. As a long time fan I have some favourites from other albums and B sides which did not make it here. Enya, her producer Nicky Ryan and lyricist Roma Ryan picked their favourites from their oeuvre to populate this compilation album. Get the Deluxe version-CD + DVD if you wish to experience Enya's music in all its audio and visual glory. The full, previously unreleased version of 'Aniron' with its lilt at the end, composed for the Lord of the Rings soundtrack-The Fellowship of the Ring is worth every cent. This version shows just how much fans and listeners missed out based on the soundtrack's edited version. Forget that one, take this version on any given day.<br /><br />For casual listeners, the standard version minus the DVD and a shorter track list will make a compact introduction. However, be forewarned, you'll end up so enchanted by the music, you might end up seeking out this deluxe version and every Enya release out there!
B000HWZ61Y|1.0|What a shame and a waste of money. The sound is so compressed on this remaster (in the name of making the CD's as loud as possible) that the dynamics are simply lost. The music sounds so suppressed and lifeless, including the bonus B-sides. As a Def Leppard fan since 1981, this is really disappointing. While Hysteria is not my favorite Def Lep album, it is still enjoyable, especially with the 4 main studio B-sides, but not on this remaster.<br /><br />When I first listened to the CD's they seemed fuller with more low end. It seemed great...at first. I started to wonder why I began listening to the remaster less and less over the last couple years. Then I dug out the original CD and CD singles. I realized how instruments that jumped out on the original now just all blend together on the remaster. Drum hits that popped out before are softened and now in the background along with every other peak. The definition is gone.<br /><br />A perfect example is the great ending of Women. On this remaster, nothing jumps out. It is no longer the awesome climatic end to the song that it is on the original.<br /><br />Even the B-sides are very adversely affected and not enjoyable at all like they are on previous CD single releases. Tear It Down is so much better on the promo CD of Women or the CD single and CDV single of Animal, which also has the full extended remix of Animal. On this deluxe set, the last section of remix is inexplicably missing. They simply cut it short.<br /><br />The drum intro to Ride Into the Sun sounds so dead. All the life is sucked out of it.<br /><br />Feel can be hard to describe or pinpoint, but the feel and excitement of albums are destroyed by this kind of mastering that has become the norm for new albums and reissues alike. That feeling that made you pump your fist to the original will eventually (or immediately) disappear with this version.<br /><br />It makes no difference how loud or full the CD sounds compared to the original. When they eliminateall of the peaks, the music overall loses its power. All of the accents are gone.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the record companies (and sometimes the artists) simply want their discs to be as loud as possible. The only way to do that is to compress the music by lowering the peaks and bringing up the valleys.<br /><br />If I posted this review when I first got this remaster it would have been as glowing as some of the other reviews here. It's easy to think initially \\"it's bigger, fuller and louder\\" but over time you'll wonder why you just don't enjoy it quite as much anymore. The punch is simply gone.<br /><br />Much if the time, the levels on this remaster are so maxed out that the level indicators on my CD player are all lit up to the max continuously for extended periods without moving up or down. You don't need to be an audio engineer to realize that nothing can stand out then. Everything is just mushed together. The level indicators should move up and down throughout a song. If you remember the old cassette decks that had those meters, they always bounced up and down. That's how it was in the recording studio when they recorded these tracks on the master tapes. That's how it is on the original CD's. The tracks had dynamics. This remaster has eliminated all of the dynamics of the originals. Parts of songs that used to be loud compared to other parts are relatively reduced in volume and there's no longer those big contrasts.<br /><br />If you don't believe it can be that bad, for a great example and side by side comparison, search YouTube for a video titled<br />\\"Loudness War is killing music\\" (not my video) and you'll see and hear what I'm talking about comparing Dire Straits' Money for Nothing original CD vs. the remastered CD. It is the exact same effect as on this remaster.<br /><br />Stick to the original CD and CD singles. It seems tempting to have all of this on 2CD's, but it is a waste of money and useless when you can't enjoy the music.<br /><br />Here's what to get instead:<br /><br />Hysteria -the Hysteria regular CD (which is still in-print and has the original mastering as of now).<br /><br />The main B-sides:<br /><br />Tear it Down (87 mix)- this is really killed and bland on the deluxe set, all the energy is sucked right out of this awesome track and the drums are completely buried. Get the '87 US Women promo CD, Animal '87 CD single or CD Video single. The Women promo often shows up on eBay.<br /><br />I Wanna Be Your Hero (87 mix) -available on the Hysteria '87 CD single. This is another one of my favorite tracks that has been decimated. When the heavy part kicks in, it created so much energy. On the remaster, it just falls flat. The heavy part isn't loud enough compared to the mellow intro because everything is too maxed out.<br /><br />Ride Into the Sun (87 mix) -also on the Hysteria CD single. This heavy song is also killed on the deluxe set. Compared to the CD single, the drums in the intro sound dead, like cardboard boxes being hit.<br /><br />Ring of Fire (87 mix)- available on the Armageddon It '87 CD single.<br /><br />That's all the really necessary and killer Hysteria B-sides. The extended mixes are ok for a listen or two, but they're not better than the album mixes. Release Me is really a joke B-side with one of their roadies doing deliberately awful vocals. Joe does not do any lead vocals on it. The live stuff is ok, but not really necessary. If you really want the extended mixes or live tracks, they are all on various CD singles.<br /><br />Here's some other compressed remasters I've wasted money on that should be avoided. I listened to these for a long time before I realized what was missing from the music. This is by no means a complete list. More remasters these days are overly compressed than not. Simply, these are some of the ones that I own and am really glad I never ditched the original CD's. These are albums that I love and do not just casually listen to:<br /><br />AC/DC:<br />All Atlantic and Sony remasters<br /><br />Anthrax:<br />Among the Living Deluxe Edition 2009 remaster CD/DVD<br /><br />Black Sabbath:<br />Ozzy years Black Box<br /><br />Def Leppard:<br />Pyromania Deluxe Edition<br />Hysteria Deluxe Edition<br />((I haven't bought the Adrenalize Deluxe, but given the compression of the other 2 above, I won't).<br /><br />Helloween:<br />All Sanctuary deluxe remasters with bonus tracks<br /><br />Iron Maiden:<br />All 1998 remasters<br /><br />Journey:<br />All 1996 and 2006 remasters<br /><br />Metallica:<br />All the early CD's that were secretly remastered (they are not labeled as remasters; any with \\"EMI Ventues\\" on the back tray insert are the recent pressings that are remastered)<br /><br />Ozzy Osbourne:<br />Every remaster including:<br /><br />Blizzard of Ozz 2010 remaster<br /><br />Diary of a Madman 2010 remaster and 2010 Legacy edition<br /><br />30th Anniversary box set remasters (are the same as above)<br /><br />All 2002 remasters:<br />Blizzard, Diary, Bark, Tribute, No Rest, No More Tears, Ozzmosis, Ozzman Cometh<br /><br />All 1995 remasters (not the worst, but still compressed):<br />Blizzard, Diary, Speak, Bark, Ultimate, Tribute, No Rest, No More Tears, Live and Loud<br /><br />(All that's left for Ozzy are the original CD issues, which are the ones to get)<br /><br />REO Speedwagon:<br />Hi Infidelity Anniversary remaster<br /><br />Supertramp:<br />Breakfast in America 2002 and 2010 remasters (can't comment on the other titles).<br />However, the Japan-only 2013 Platinum CD is simply stunning. It sounds three-dimensional and incredible. That is how a CD should sound and it has received accolades along with other Platinum releases that Universal has done in Japan. (Note: if your CD player cannot play CD-R's, according to Universal, it won't play a Platinum disc).<br /><br />Van Halen:<br />All 2000 remasters<br /><br />Whitesnake:<br />1987 (self-titled) Deluxe Edition 2010 remaster CD/DVD<br /><br />1987 (self-titled)/Slip of the Tongue Axe Killer label 2000 remaster 2CD<br /><br />Here I Go Again The Whitesnake Collection 2CD of Slide/1987/Slip<br /><br />Hope all of that helps. You have been warned. Don't waste your money on this remaster. Get the originals if you really want to enjoy this music the way it should sound.<br /><br />If you think this remaster, or the other remasters listed above are great, like I used to, seriously just check out those eye (and ear) opening videos mentioned above.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|I love what the producers of 300 did with this movie! I wonder why this movie wasn't hyped? Not sure if WB was afraid of over hyping it too much. But frankly I hope they continue the saga. Awesome slow mo's and graphics!
B002QXIMY0|1.0|What a shame and a waste of money. The sound is so compressed on this remaster (in the name of making the CD as loud as possible) that the dynamics are simply lost.

Drum hits that popped out before are softened and now in the background along with every other peak, making for a very generic modernized sound. The definition is gone. Frantic cymbal crashes no longer really crash. My favorite part of Skeletons at 3:44-3:49 is a prime example of how Charlie gets totally lost in the bland sonics of this remaster.<br /><br />Feel can be hard to describe or pinpoint, but the feel and excitement of great albums like this are destroyed by this kind of mastering that has become the norm for new albums and reissues alike. That feeling that made you pump your fist to the original will eventually (or instantly) disappear with this version.<br /><br />It makes no difference how loud or full the CD sounds compared to the original.

They don't differ much from the album tracks. The alternate lead is cool, but not as good as the album version. The DVD is cool. However, I read in another review here that the quality isn't improved over the VHS. I don't have the VHS so I can't confirm this so the DVD is my consolation prize basically.<br /><br />This is a 1-star version of a 5-star album. Stick to the original single disc CD with the original mastering since it's still available. There's not a bad track on Among and the original is much more enjoyable to listen to.<br /><br />Here's some other compressed remasters I've wasted money on that should be avoided.

0765325950|5.0|If you are thinking about picking this one up, make sure you start with book 1 (eye of the world). I love fantasy, and this met my needs. It is very innocent, the main characters are conservative small town kids who take love and marriage very seriously, which may be unusual in fantasy. It was a great journey, and this book really brought it all together.
B0086HGW42|5.0|I intended to buy The A Team song, after listening to it on a radio show. Hearing the rest of the songs on the album I decided to get the entire album and didn't regret it.<br /><br />Ed Sheeran's songs enfold a lot of emotion and have a fantastic rhythm. The songs differ from each other substantially and I’m constantly surprised, as though listening to them for the first time.

B007FTZDN8|5.0|I love TED talks, I used to watch them on Youtube, then Netflix, then downloaded them for mobile, and less battery consuming, viewing. I can almost guarantee that there is a talk that will interest the most educationally-adverse individual out there. Plus, I can download them to my kindle, use the bluetooth to play the audio through my truck speakers, and watch them while waiting in the car. (*alternatively you can simply download the audio, which I suggest if you plan on driving while taking in some TED.)
1936891026|2.0|I honestly do not know why or how this has so many five star reviews.  First thing is first; this is not a book.  It's a bloated inspirational pamphlet.  It's about 120 pages, with most pages only containing one or two paragraphs.(not-so-cleverly aping the style of Sun Tzu's The Art of War)  I like the writer's concept of \\"The Resistance\\" (a.k.a. writer's block)  However, from early on he begins injecting a lot of very generic and pseudo-spiritual buzzwords and phrases.  Some parts of the book come off almost like Scientology indoctrination.  I'm sure there are a lot of people who found this a great motivational tool, but I'm sure they would have just as easily gotten the same fulfillment from reading \\"The Secret\\" or anything Tony Robbins has written.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is so heart felt. An amazingly true and blunt story of the horrors of cancer and of people who live c with it. This book is simply amazing.
0470913029|3.0|While the author mentions Omega-3 and Ocean food he completely ignores the Aquatic Ape Hypothesis which is the basic source for the argument on Omega-3 and ocean food, and bases his book on the Hunter Gatherer Hypothesis.<br />He also attacks the use of salt, sodium chloride. According to the Aquatic Ape Hypothesis our ancestors spent millions of years in a semi-aquatic environment, which means that they spent a significant amount of time in ocean motor, which is loaded with many salts and minerals, including sodium chloride.<br /><br />Miguel Melgar

B004SBS8LA|4.0|A lot of fun to play, the monkeys are interesting characters!! I usually play a few levels a day to past time.
B0086700CM|4.0|Fun game. keeps you on the edge of your seat. Once you master it, it's a lot of fun and you don't want to stop playingit.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game makes me want to just freak out it is so awesome I cant stand it  if you like the awsomeness of trying to survive in the night when all sorts of monster try to kill you and in da morning u go and build the awsomest house or sand castle or snow manchine then buy the freaking gameee
B0054TKAZW|4.0|I just enjoy stories of this nature and like how easily I can purchase and view them via Amazon. Try out an episode.
B00B2EWNWG|5.0|I've been a fan of Asian Martial/acton movies and this one is a rare find. Everything's fantastic from cinematography to visual effects.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Awesome hidden objects game with a twist. Can't wait to play it again and the second one. Would definitely recommend you to buy this game
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game.  Can't get very far yet but it's fun trying.  Grandkids love it also.  Fun to play awhile then come back later.
B00ANW33CM|4.0|By looking at the pictures I see two of the biggest complaints right away!  It's not flat &amp; it's timed, otherwise why would a pause button be needed??  So, if that's what you want theirs hundreds of pretty good free ones all exactly the same!<br /><br />So, the game play is a little more exciting than a flat board but the controls were too difficult for me to figure out &amp; get used to.  I played about 7 games before deciding to review it &amp; earned 3 stars, the Max, on all of them so it's not impossible.  You can touch tiles even if they aren't facing you if you  remembered which one it is.<br /><br />If the movement of the board was better I would like this game 100%!  I knew what I was getting when I installed it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a fun game for all ages and i love it.If your worried about it not being scary for kids under 5 then just make sure you have them play creative instead of survival because survival does contain monsters.Other than its a great game and i love to build giant houses.This game so worth 6.99!
B000YXMMAO|5.0|I love this album. Not my favorite radiohead album but still amazing because hey, it's radiohead. I would buy it again
B0043RSK3K|5.0|Everybody in the U.S. should be required to read this text.  Many people have a very one-sided, overly-glorified viewpoint of  U.S. history, when in reality we are a country that has been largely shaped by capitalism without much thought for any harm these ventures might do to other countries, peoples, or cultures.  It is a history of greed and special interests.  While I don't want to hate on the U.S., I also think it's important for a citizenry to be well-informed of ALL aspects of their history, not just the good ones.  Such awareness can guide wise actions towards future change.
B004OA2G0E|5.0|I bought a record player mainly because i wanted to listen to radiohead on records. I'm not too into this album though. Hopefully their next one will be better
0307950654|1.0|One of the reasons P and P is among the most enduring books of all time is that the main character, Elizabeth, is a great character.  She is intelligent, witty, strong willed, and willing to go against social conventions of her day.  However, in Death Comes to Pemberley, Elizabeth is little more than background decoration.  The plot could be summarized without mentioning her at all...she plays so little a role.<br /><br />This might be forgiven if the  novel were an engaging mystery, but it's not. It is dry, and bereft of the wit and charm of P and P.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|This is a game that seems to interest children.  I suppose it is good for a person's hand-to-eye co-ordination, but it is rather senseless otherwise.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I have only used this a few times but it works perfectly as long as you follow the on screen instructions
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I thought that this series was most interesting.  The actors do a wonderful job portraying their characters.  The setting where the story takes place are extremely well done and seem to be authentic.  The costumes worn by the actors also seem authentic, and often make one wish that we were living back in the era when these clothes were worn.  The mixture of happiness and sadness in the story line makes this series very interesting.
B007SGM084|5.0|I chose this series to see what all the fuss is about, and while it is definitely hot and steamy.. the more I progressed in the trilogy, I actually found myself skimming those parts in order to get back to the real story of Ana and Christian. Some of my favorite bits are when they flirt and tease via emails. The author does a beautiful job of describing the characters feelings like the hope and fear when one of the characters ends up in the hospital. I'm so glad I took a chance on these.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|It's ok. It was a decent movie. However somethings felt forced, like the woman with three breast. There were no mutants etc, so don't know how she got in there. The action sequences were hit and miss some seemed way to slow. But I'd watch again.
0375422307|5.0|History, comedy,...just so interesting for any one of any age and any kind of back ground or interest.  Loved reading it. Loved every page and
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This movie was AWFUL avoid at all cost. Especially if you have children.<br />This movie has about everything you wouldn't want in your living room, feces on the floor, teddy bear sex etc<br />This movie is garbage it needs a negative rating.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very good game that I enjoy when I'm bored or just waiting for something. Once you have played this game, it's like you can't get enough. You can go against your Facebook friends high scores. There is always a challenge when you play subway surfer.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is every fun and my daughter just loves the horses and taking care of them. App works great on my tablet.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It is not my favorite game because it doesn't let you do very much and that bothers me because you don't move a lot and I like to move the people and in subway surfers I can't do that as much as I want too and so by that matter is not the best game in the whole world or even for me.
B009AMANBA|5.0|The great thing about \\"Lincoln\\" is not so much that Steven Spielberg directed it (which he did a great job) or that Daniel Day-Lewis starred in it (he did a phenomenal job!), but that the writing (by Tony-winner Tony Kushner) is so spot on when it comes to the details. Sure, it's got all of the political mumbo-jumbo, but I loved that it also showed the very complex portrait of Lincoln, the man. From his troubled relationship to his wife Mary Todd (Sally Field) to his jokes with which nobody seemed to get because of it's dark and thinking humor. It might help the viewer to know going into this movie that the story here centers around Lincoln's struggle to get the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution passed (which would outlaw slavery), and is not a full biography picture (bio-pic). Tommy Lee Jones shines and marvels as Republican Congressional leader Thaddeus Stevens! The best thing about Spielberg's films is the humanity that shines through -- not just from the actors but also in the way he blocks and shoots scenes (i.e., there's a scene in [[ASIN:B00005JLSB Catch Me If You Can (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]] when Leonardo DiCaprio hugs his father, Christopher Walken, and there's a simple shot of Walken's hand on the back of DiCaprio -- it's a simple shot that conveys so much emotion about fathers and sons without any words being said). This alone is why Spielberg seems born to do what he's doing. This was not my favorite of the year, but it was definitely one of the top films!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome. i love the tour around the world,the holiday addition and the characters. i thought u did awesome.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|A lot of diehard fans of the original Broadway musical were awfully skeptical about the actors' singing and cinematic interpretations of a musical they have loved and adored for years. And I was one of those same fans. However, let me put this to rest right now. The film version is just as good as the Broadway musical. There are pros and cons to the cinematic version. One pro is also a con in that the singers can really emote better with their voices and faces, making the film seem more real; however, their voices sometimes go a bit too soft -- although it is a very minor occurrence. Another con is Russell Crowe's singing voice as Inspector Javert. Now, I know his songs are extremely difficult to sing, and Crowe does have a singing background, but his voice just didn't \\"wow\\" me like the others did. Still, he did OK. Samantha Barks as Eponine (one of my favorite characters) was fantastic and really honed the character she'd been playing since 2010 at Westminster's Queen's Theatre. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the villainous Thenardiers did OK, but they just couldn't hold a candle to Alun Armstrong and Jenny Galloway's performances. Hugh Jackman retains his theatrical chops as Jean Valjean and has the power to both sing and heavily emote, making you believe he is the tortured, reformed man of God; also, I loved that director Tom Hooper cast the original (to me) Valjean, Colm Wilkinson, as the Bishop. But the heavy hitter here -- the Academy Award-winning performance -- is that of Anne Hathaway. If you've ever read my blog or heard me talk of her, you know I'm not the biggest fan of hers. Then, [[ASIN:B004LWZWGA The Dark Knight Rises (+Ultraviolet Digital Copy)]] came out and I had to admit she did pretty well. Now, with that plus this performance, I'm eating crow. She was spectacular. Her performance while singing \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" was the best acting -- and, at the same time, singing -- I've seen in a very long time. There's a moment in the song where she's about to hit a high note and you see her convulsing, almost hyperventilating, and think she won't hit that note. But she does. And the fact that all of the actors sang live on set lets you know that she's got talent. If she doesn't get some kind of major award for this role, then awards will be useless. A great musical and a great movie; director Tom Hooper has a great eye for cinematography and some of the most simple shots in the film come in at the right time and are magnificant to look at. The musical is all here (in the film) in its entirety -- singing and all! (Slight note: the only lines cut in the film is at the beginning of \\"Beggars at the Feast\\"; I guess the filmmakers wanted to be more politically correct, so they cut out the verse that contains: \\"Here comes a prince/There goes a Jew/This one's a queer/But what can you do?\\") Overall, this is one of the best films of the year as well as one of the best movie musicals ever. Even better, fans, it's all in here -- all of the music and sing-talking, as well as the underlying message of how our actions can touch and affect others -- \\"to love another person is to see the face of God\\" and \\"even the darkest nights will end and the sun will rise.\\" Just make sure you use the restroom before going into the movie ... since it clocks in at just a shade under three hours.ere she's about to hit a high note and you see her convulsing, almost hyperventilating, and think she won't hit that note.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|A good game that I have played every day for a long time. You will not want to put it down because you will be obsesed with getting coins!!
B005LAII62|4.0|This one definitely surprised me! In a year that was completely anti-bullying, one of the most prominent stories to feature this storyline was \\"ParaNorman\\" (from the makers of [[ASIN:B003UAKE9Y Coraline]]), which is about a little boy who can see ghosts. He doesn't mind being different but it's the living that he has a hard time dealing with. His most commonly used phrase is \\"I just want to be alone.\\" However, when he is handed the task of preventing an infamous witch's curse on his town, he learns that having friends has its advantages. And when he confronts the witch at the climax of the film, no better dialogue has ever been written in regards to bullying and passing on hatred as your legacy. A fun film that's just as much of a life lesson for adults as it is for kids!
B00992CF6W|5.0|diapointig that thrers no up date<br />were is the up date but I still love the game man wool man but werewolf the up date
B008ZVNC2O|2.0|Clearly not up to his previous standards. I am very disappointed.and would not recommend this at all. What a waste of talent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I started playing this on my nephew's Kindle and was quickly hooked.  Fun music, pretty good graphics and cute characters.  The quests are easy and I wish it didn't take so long to build up coins but I still play far more than I should!
B0017VT5E8|5.0|I rented this movie because it was advised by a fellow Film Student. Overall, I thought it was a good movie, but I feel like I need to know more about the films being put out by Hollywood to make an intelligent judgement.
1400052173|5.0|This book is amazing.  As a cancer survivor myself, I cannot begin to imagine the pain of losing this amazingly strong lady to this horrible disease. I experienced many 'ah ha' moments during the reading of this book.  It should be required reading! Definitely a must read.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|It's easy to use, works as advertised and generous with storage space. Highly recommend this one for sharing photos with friends.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The humble reader of the thriller genre has very few demands and merely looks for a few basic qualities in a book:<br /><br />-It should have a complex but non-convoluted plot<br />-It should have characters who are believable and 'empathy worthy'<br />-It should have simple chapters,sufficient twists and stick to the point.<br />-It should be a page turner<br /><br />'Gone Girl' has one more endearing quality : it is written brilliantly with a very original and stylistic approach that makes it one of the best written books of 2012.<br /><br />The story starts with the disappearance of a housewife and the chapters cleverly alternate with a first person narrative by the husband after the disappearance, and the diary kept by the wife before she disappeared. The dates of the diary slowly creep towards the day of the disappearance and then the story takes an unexpected turn (the desired plot twist).<br /><br />Ironically, had this book been written by a male,it might have come off as demeaning,misogynistic and patronizing toward women. But the gender of the author sets this bias aside and makes this high voltage book hard hitting,visceral and most importantly believable and not just because the author's picture resembles what the main character might have looked like !<br />If you are looking for a fast moving tale with a deliciously extraordinary variation of a 'he said-she said' theme, don't let this book be gone before reading it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|good,but it's a little glitchy...I turn and it tales a second or two....but otherwise I think it's a pretty good game. I like the setting.

B0023SDQB2|5.0|The main characters are vivid and interesting.  I felt compelled to read the second and third volumes of the trilogy!  A great read!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|You've written another book about a very difficult subject, with flawed characters, and filled it with emotion and romance.  I loved the characters, they'll stay with me.  I'm sure this will be a book that I re-read, as very few books can pack this much emotional power.  Keep writing and I'll be sure to continue buying your books!
B0087JTAKW|3.0|The book was interesting. But by the time I finished, i had to ask myself, why did the author write this. What was his point? I got the message of the book. But I still felt... unmoved i suppose. It was okay.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is such an amazing series. You'll be completely drawn in. Very well written. By the 2nd book in this series I was already checking if anyone was making on movie on this cuz its so good (Ridley Scott bought the rights, so cross your fingers). I couldnt stop talking about it to everyone.<br /><br />You wont be dissappointed. 5 books for the price on one, what a deal, and its great!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses but have never been able to have any of my own. Apps like this allow a person to have a &quot;pet&quot; they normally wouldn't be able to. It's fun and a trifle addicting too.

B0022W6L6G|5.0|Look, if you're from the 80s (mostly), you really have to get this disc.  There are many iconic bands from the 1980s and FM is one of them...there are so many songs on here that you will recognize and the one or two that you don't...well, who cares.  I challenge you to find another album with as many great songs...enjoy...highly recommended...

B00571F26Y|5.0|In a nutshell - life changing.  I was diagnosed 'pre-diabetic' about 18 months ago and my doctor recommended a low glycemic diet.  Not surprisingly, I thought I was eating healthy, and with normal weight for my size / age, a bit confused by the diagnosis.  A few visits later this book was recommended by my doctor.  I have implemented all the advice in this book, along with adopting a 'primal' 'paleo' diet.  Within 12 months, all my numbers returned to normal levels (sugar, LDL, triglycerides, etc). My whole family is now realizing the benefits of being 'wheat-free' and eating whole foods in its stead.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY HUSBAND FOR CHRISTMAS. HE LOVES OLD WESTERNS. HE HAD A GOOD TIME WATCHING THIS.  I RECOMMEND
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Pay close attention to the dialogue.  The motivation is clever.  The cast is terrific.  The beginning talking heads from various government agencies create a bit of a muddle, but otherwise great action and fun.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|FUNNY.  EMOTIONAL.  LOTS OF FUN.  I LOVED THE BEGINNING AND I LOVED THE END.  I WOULD RECOMMEND.  I LOVE BRITISH FILMS.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|I ordered this because it is popular with the young crowd and I wanted to see first hand what the attraction was.  I found it rather graphic and mature and cannot suggest it to younger teenagers.
B001GNFT1K|5.0|This is one of my favorite TV series.  The movie is a nice complement to the the TV series.  I like having the extended cut.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A sad story like all stories about abuse in an orphanage.  My heart goes out to those who suffered at the hands of such heartless caretakers.  I so wanted James to feel the love he so desperately needed and deserved.  Even though the words at times were to understand, due to the Irish dialect, I still found the book to be an enjoyable read.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|Love the girls and the movie.  I like that they include details of each of the lady's lives.  The scenery is beautiful.
B008J1QFLU|5.0|Greetings from set #3130 in Sweden!<br /><br />The folks at Decca are somewhat cryptical when using concepts as \\"Pure Audio\\" and \\"Lossless 24 bit audiophile quality\\". Anyway, the Blu Ray disc in this set was sampled at 48 kHz / 24 bit. This is better than 44.1 kHz / 16 bit which is offered by the common CD, but cannot be compared with newer recordings on SACD or Blu Ray audio. To my ears, the Blu ray disc included here sounds marginally better than the CDs included in [[ASIN:B0000042H4 the set released in 1997]] (which was a huge improvement over the original CD release, remastered in 1985). Because the original tapes are now too fragile for a new remastering, Decca used the 1997 remaster for the present release. An interesting question is therefore which sampling frequency Decca used for the remastering in 1997. According to a well known hi-fi magazine, the remastering in 1997 was made at 48 kHz / 24 bit, that is, the same technique used in this set.<br /><br />In 2009, the Japanese Esoteric company released a SACD version of the Solti Ring (1000 copies). That SACD of course was 1 bit / 2.8 MHz. It was sourced from the 1997 24-bit / 48 kHz masters, not from the analogue tapes, so the signal had to be converted. Therefore, the SACD is not likely to be better than the BD in this set (in fact, one reviewer says it is inferior). And because of the state of the tapes, it is probably not possible to have a better version in the future, than the BD included here.<br /><br />Despite the relatively small sound improvement, it is not possible to give this set less than five stars, because of all the extras that are included, and the nice package. If you own the set from 1997, however, and are not interested in the books and extras, I would think twice before investing in the present set.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|It was just alright.  Better than TV reruns.  Brolin did a great job of being the young agent K.  That was the best thing about it.
0307744434|2.0|I read this book as it was a book club choice.  I found it hard to follow, and not to my liking.  I did not like the science fiction aspects of it.

B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Read the book in one day. If you like murder mysteries this is definately one to check out. Looking forward to the next in the series.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My kids and I love to play the game. We take turns to see who can get the highest score. The game has reset without warning. Our multiplier was up to x26 yesterday and then it reset to x1 and the characters we had unlocked were gone as well. It is a fun way to pass time other than that.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Obviously this is a pure novelty purchase. Lego's are expensive and this is no exception. I still love these because I have been playing Minecraft since it was in alpha stages. The blocks are quality just like other sets. Who wouldn't like to build some Minecraft stuff in real life?
1440503257|5.0|This has a bunch of recipes that I have had in the past, a few that are just given a new twist and several new to me recipes.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I'm using it as a daily food log, and journal of personal events. I add photos, and additional notes to really capture and log all the details of an event.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|easy to keep up on the weather. Fast and convenient for those on the go to know what the weather will be
B000W7JWUA|5.0|While it may seem that Settlers of Catan is a basic straight forward game on top, the dynamic changes drastically as you must trade and be on your toes as you expand your Settlement across Catan. Every move is dramatic and has consequence that could make you either a target or a friend. If you are new to this game it will take a bit of adjusting to how each move is conducted but once you have those details down, the game progresses smoother as you play. I wasn't sure when I bought this, but now I am sure this is a game I will be playing for years to come. And since there are expansions for the core game alone, you have unlimited re playability.<br /><br />Have fun and stay frosty...!
B00136JOVG|5.0|I had to get this album. I just love him. I love his music. I really dislike writing reviews for anything
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I have read several other books and like Nelson's style. While they are fiction he uses real contemporary situations and places that are relevant and informative today.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|Good for quick notes. Not the worse that I have used. Good for quick and short notes. Still use on occasion.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|A great little game<br />I downloaded it for my young niece and decided to give it a try for myself. So far I am enjoying the game and graphics.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|Never worked on my cell phone. It would force shut down and never fully loaded on my cell phone. Maybe my phone was at fault not sure.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This show actually does a good job depicting life in ones late 20s and early 30s living in Manhattan. Sure, some of it is a bit over the top, but it captures the energy and randomness of NYC. Much more so than Friends.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I think the is the best of flynn's novels. If you are going to choose just one get this one!
B000Q76K24|5.0|Loved this movie.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Dark places is a great twist and turn novel and you do relate to the main character. I enjoy this author.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I've read everything  Martin's written on ASOIAF and by far this is the best book. I believe it's the longest book in the series and the most pivotal one.<br />Brace yourself for the red wedding, you won't be ready for it, no matter how many spoilers you've read or heard.<br />Above all, enjoy the ride!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Sharp objects deals with many mental disorders especially cutting and being a hypochondriac. I enjoyed the intertwined stories. Love this author.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love to fill time with this game...and It can be very addicting at night when you want to go to bed!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|You really don't have to take my word. You don't know me. I understand. I'm not out for injustice.<br />I just don't want to see other people taken advantage from.<br />Please understand that I'm not out for vengence. However, I played \\"Ice Age Village\\" and spent money on good faith because the game was fun.<br />Only to find that:<br />GameLoft will squeeze every cent you have from this \\"Free App\\" or any game they sell. And yes, I said sell, and they don't care who they hurt.<br />You also have to realize that 99% of the people who give this game a 5 star rating,,,,work for Gameloft. The 5 star rating does not represent a true representation of all the players who play this game.<br /><br />Here is a sample post from a forum about the problems with GameLoft and their games.<br /><br />Re: How many happy/angry customers towards Gameloft? PLEASE VOTE<br /><br />\\"Gameloft has no intention of providing adequate support. It's not needed in their business model which is based on constantly releasing new games / updates to get new income streams from new customers. Support for existing customers with bugs and issues is an unnecessary expense which only impacts Gameloft's net income negatively. Because these \\"frustrated\\" customers don't spend money on the games anymore.<br />Gameloft has no intention of providing bug-free games either. Same argument as above and another unnecessary expense which can be avoided. Because obviously getting the bugs out of the games would require more testing and therefore more time, resources and costs and would delay time to market of the game / update. And this means delayed income! And higher costs and delayed income is not good for a (short term) business (model), believe me.<br /><br />And I don't accept the argument \\"that it is software and software always has bugs\\" either. The game software behind these games is rather simple and it would be absolutely doable to release games/updates without major bugs. Other gaming companies can do it.....<br /><br />And just think about it. Games always work very well at the beginning and lower game levels and are very addictive. Players start to spend money and give positive feedback on iTunes and Google store etc. And later when you encounter the problems and bugs, you have no way of changing your feedback again. And iTunes and Google don't care really either because for them Gameloft games are in the free apps category.<br /><br />Comes close to a scam in my opinion, and Gameloft knows this and that's why they give you free gems if you complain.<br />And we players are happy again when we get a couple of free gems, we play again, we smile again ... and nothing ever changes.\\"<br /><br />There are posts here on this forum from US players who have actually gotten their money back via their credit card legal departments after disclosing this business model.<br /><br />And if you wonder why these kind of post are not being deleted from this forum? Very simply much better players only express their negative feeling here on this forum, hardly anybody reads it anyway, compared to the same posts possibly released on the web or maybe even iTunes and / or Google store.
0978545095|5.0|Meet alla my expectation.<br />The story of  Vivian Maier is interesting and quite unusual in the history of photography.<br />She deserves more and more albums.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|We had recorded Rio on our tv and our grandson just loves it. So, we ordered one for him at Christmas so he could watch it at his home too.
B0052YAKS6|5.0|I was impressed that I enjoy ALL of the songs on this album - normally when I buy an album, at least one or two songs don't stand out to me.  I can listen to this album all the way through without any desire to skip a song.  The songs differ enough where I don't feel like I'm listening to the same song for the whole album, and the different guest vocals each add something to the dance beats they accompany.  My particular favorites are \\"Little Bad Girl\\" and \\"Titanium,\\" but really, I love the whole thing.  Very upbeat and catchy - definitely provides good motivation to move!
B0044XRIMW|5.0|I have twins 3yr old girls and they adore musicals and this is such a good movie with no bad words or or bad influences it is not crazy tv its very mellowing and soothing to them.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|This app does not work on the Kindle fire you cannot see the download button to download songs I have tried everything.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Totally happy with this charger. It's shallow depth makes it fit my cars cigarette lighter socket easily. A problem with some other chargers.<br />I read when buying this product, someone didn't like the fact that there was &#34;another light on my dash to distract me.&#34; Your cigarette lighter is in your line of sight? Way off to your right and below your line of sight is a distraction? Stop driving then, or. put a piece of duct tape over it. Get creative and make it a custom fit. I like the light.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|easy read, sad and poignant at the same time.  i enjoyed the book very much and would recommend it to anyone
B0064O927I|1.0|This must be the worst watch ever, the touch interface is so unprecise!<br />I brought it back to the store (Geneva), and they gave me back somebody else his watch!?!<br />Worst watch and worst costumer service from Swatch. .
B005S9EJ46|5.0|Wonderful concept of a &#34;chosen&#34; retired life!  It is fresh and new.<br />The characters were outstanding and their development throughtout the film rewarding.
1439152802|5.0|I have read all of her books, and this one is my favorite.  This book is full of surprises, right up to the end.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|This is a British mini-series about a modern woman who switches places with Elizabeth Bennet of P&P...just in time to meet Bingley and Darcy...and the story takes a different route than what Jane Austen wrote. It's funny and cute, nothing too epic or deep. Elliot Cowan makes a very swoon-worthy Darcy. I'd seen the mini series a couple times before, but I gave in and bought it because of him. Since it was a mini-series, it is several hours long, but it is enjoyable. If you like Austen adaptations like Bridget Jones or Austenland, British actors, and yummy Elliot Cowan, you might like it. Now I have talked myself into watching it again because Darcy's smile is a wonderful thing.
B001ANSS5K|2.0|I liked the beginning. It grabbed you, things were happening.  Then it reaches a point where nothing happens. This could have been a great short story or novella, instead it was painfully stretched into a novel.  I initially skipped over some parts, then felt guilty and went back and read them, and then regretted not skipping them.
B007SUW24W|5.0|Not many CDs today that I can listen start to finish without skipping songs.  This is one of them!  Bought several to give to friends.  Upbeat, good driving music.  Very talented singer songwriter!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This series has by far been the greatest surprise in my recent reading history. Very good story, very addictive. I spent several nights reading way later than I should have because I could not put it down.
B003XRELEI|5.0|I loved it.  It was smart, funny, sad, touching ....perfect. I like the penis measurement quotes too.  Overall a great read
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I use this all the time. I don't use the stand feature too often, but sometimes I do and I really like the case. Easy access and good protection. It's so handy.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I just purchased my kindle and decided to try making. I like this very much and it works good on my kindle. I would recommend this to anyone who likes challenging games.
B001608R5I|5.0|Ok, we all know the Raconteurs (if you don't , you really should give them a look) and know that this is a great album from head to toe, its really good and an everlasting pleasure to listen; The vinyl comes in a triple-gatefold kind of deal (really nice actually) in which you can see the cover photo complete. The album contains 2 black LPs, both in their individual plastic shrink wrap and they both run at 33rpm (despite what the amazon description said). Included are four big photos (around 8 1/2\\" I think) including the band members, one for each. In conclusion, if you love vinyl and the band and you have some extra cash lying around (lets face it, it is pricey but worth it, try to buy it cheaper if you can) , I would definitely recommend you to give this a try.<br />Hope this can be helpful and thanks for taking the time to read!
B00006879E|5.0|This is the best compilation Maroon 5 has ever done. Every song is worth listening to.  I loved it so much that I had to go on the Internet to find out more about the Jane who inspired the album.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This is a great continuation of a great story. Martin's writing is as inspiring as it is intriguing. I feel his inspiration will strengthen the works of many future authors.
B004TI1WME|4.0|I have tried other calculators that didn't have the tape feature but didn't like them.  With Office Calculator Pro,  I can go back and check my figures to see if they were correct instead of entering and running the entire calculation again and wondering if the new calculation was correct.
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|Springsteen makes it work with another wonderful cd.  Even though alot of his music might sound the same, each song is always unique.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|Looks good here in Tiger Nation. Fits my Kindle Fire just fine<br />I would recommend to anyone with a similar ebook
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Rebus needs the work; Scotland needs Rebus detecting; and I simply need Rebus to read about.  Hopefully Ian Rankin will keep writing Rebus books until Rebus dies.  Even with Alzheimers, Rebus' mind/world would intrigue and challenge me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the whole series from Collins. I cant wait to see if they will make Catching Fire into a movie with jennifer Lawerence as Katniss.
1844137872|5.0|A fun collection of some of Banksy's work. Very enjoyable book, worth it just for the quote on the back from the Metro police!
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|We watched this movie together as a family movie one day..it was really cute! My daughter and I both enjoyed it ..and had quite a few laughs(after the sadness). I would recommend this movie.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is not like any boring game this is fun and active so be sure to concentrate because you don't want that cop to get you
B006LSZECO|2.0|The book started out very good but dragged on forever.  The ending left me very disappointed.  In the end the husband looked like an idiot.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game!this game is awesome. Recommend you to play this game is the flower of Tuna and t he was<br />Faith

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The thought of 20 hours in the air was depressing so I got Threat Vector  - all 800_ pages as an ebook.  I have to say I went from start to finish between Sinapore and Los Angeles. Its entertaining, fast-paced, inventive and makes the hours fly by putting you in the book's moments. A perfect companion!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Have onlyu played a few times, but it is neat to get a 'best' score and then hand it to my teen son and say \\"Beat that\\" (close but not faster yet).<br /><br />My younger daughter is not fast, but has enjoyed it so I can see it as quite fun for anyone.<br /><br />It takes about 10 minutes to completely finsh a game (best time was about 6 minutes so far). younger kids wil take much longer, but will still have great fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game I feel that this game should be able to get a huge amount of time put into it so that you can really get to know your horse.
1451673442|5.0|A must have. 1 little lesson a day, like having your own personal guide in your everyday life.<br />I love you Rhonda Byrne, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!!
B005LAII12|5.0|Mostly everyone loves one of Seth Macfarlane's shows. So, Ted was a sure thing. I found it Hilarious and couldn't wait for the DVD release. I found the extended version even funnier.
B009NX88JU|5.0|Great sound track, fits the movie perfect. I find it very easy to lose myself as the story unfolds. Highly recommend
B008RTE08E|4.0|Magical Mystery Tour was conceived by Paul McCartney to lift the Beatles out of their funk after the death of Brian Epstein. Not meant to be a serious movie, more of a fun ride through the country side with cameras. At least they looked like they had a fun time acting in it.
0525953728|5.0|i like the book, is quite interesting and thrilling! i recommend you the book if you are warfare books fan!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|The CD is basically the original Let it Be without Phil Spector's &#34;wall of sound&#34;. I find Let it Be better without the &#34;wall of sound&#34;. Also, it comes with Fly on the Wall, a 20 minute CD that is basically the Beatles messing around with their instruments.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This game is great I got it for my tablet first and this time was for my new smart phone.
074322454X|5.0|What I liked about the book is that it focused on more soldiers. Also, the book told the \\"true story\\". The Book's stories were moved around for dramatic effect in the miniseries. Back to the book, it was written well and I enjoyed reading it very much.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very addicting and fun.<br /> I loved this game.  Good graphics and engaging scenes. I liked the story line and had zero issues with game play.  Highly recommend this for casual or more advanced adventures.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Now, everyone knows that season 2 of The Walking Dead is a bit slower than season 1. Season 2 introduces Hershel's people and is the lost of a few but I think they could have summed up the searching for Sophia in 2-3 episodes, not an entire half-season. Otherwise, love the show and can't wait for the rest of season 3.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This game is so fun and the dragons are beautiful, and it is so neat that you have to use your brain to figure out which ones to breed to get a certain kind of baby.  My only complaint is the Gold factor.  PLEASE, please Team Lava be a little more user friendly to ALL your fans.  At least, allow more than 3 friends per day to give you Gold!!!!!  Or if a player plays with 30 or more friends dragons per day, give them GOLD!!!! Thank you!!
B002ZG980U|4.0|Inception is one of those movies you have to watch 2-3 times to get it. I'm not gonna say it's one of favorites, but it's a nice movie to have when nothing's on television...
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I loved the house.  I would buy it and live in it if I had millions in spare cash and a desire to live in Los Angeles.  The house was the real star of the show.  In the show, Murder House has a fascinating history and it was interesting throughout the series to learn of its history, the people who died there and the resultant ghosts in the house.<br /><br />Jessica Lange's performance as Constance is amazing; the character is so complex, half the time I wasn't sure if I loved or hated Constance.  The character of Moira was equally fascinating and contradictory.<br /><br />Overall, this show was full of dark frights and dark humor.  Thaddeus in the basement was absolutely horrifying and compelling at the same time.  Marcie the realtor and Larry the Burned Man both made me laugh.<br /><br />On the down side, too much focus on relationships, their downfalls and failures.  Hayden was extremely annoying.  I didn't love the doomed teenage romance story line so much, although I know it was one reason for the shows popularity.<br /><br />I won't be reviewing American Horror Story:  Asylum.  I hated it!!!!  I watched the first three episodes and gave up on it.
B003ELKNH2|3.0|My dad told me a scene where a soldier takes out a NVA soldier in the dark with a grenade launcher. So, thinking that was really cool, I wanted to buy it. When I did and watched it, I was bit disappointed. The plot is slow and really weird. Also, it's just Redux, it does not come with the original.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My kids love this game and I don't mind them liking it. It keeps them thinking and they can take it with them every where
B000EHSVS2|5.0|This movie is a great movie on General Patton during World War 2. I think the movie is great because of Francis Ford Coppola's screenplay and GeorgeScott's acting. Great Movie!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a interesting game. Much like jungle run. THE GAME IS REALLY FUN AN  IT IS FREE. The game has many fun things to earn and learn.
B003ASLJPY|5.0|Being the counterpart of Flags of our Fathers, I really wanted to see it. This movie showed up Flags of our Fathers in my opinion. I would recommend this for anyone that liked either the book or movie of Flags of our Fathers.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was amazing. I have always loved action book, like the maze runner, but none were as good as the hunger games trilogy
B005CA4SJW|5.0|Being the biggest fan of the Walking Dead I know, I had to buy the special edition for the great price of $20. It came with commentaries, documentaries of the making of, and the 1st episode in black and white. I have watched the season 2-3 times over and plan to watch the entire series for the 3rd season midseason premiere. Great job AMC!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun,every one I know has this game I u don't have it GET IT know fun fun fun!
B001NHNG64|5.0|My son's friend turned me on to the Jack Reacher series. I'm trying to read them in order.  The first book was very, very good.  This one is better.  Now it is on to number 3.
B009VB97EY|2.0|My girlfriend really loves the main character in this movie so i decided to be nice and rent it for her. Its not really that great of a date night movie. If you dont have a vagina, then it wont be a good movie at all. She seemed to like it, but i was miserable sitting through it.
B00B6SIT0S|5.0|Depeche Mode is as awesome now as in their younger years. This single is great and the b-side is no less as great. I'm a huge fan.
B001MEJY8W|4.0|This was only the second foreign movie iv ever seen, or at least second movie not in english, and it as great. Its bloody, violent, and its got a pretty unbelievable story. I thought it was a great buy.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|What a fun story. Accidental Las Vegas quickie marraige , seen the accidental weddings before but by far this one was most fun. Loved the characters. Like romance? Go for it.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The app works exactly as represented: a fast, basic, large-buttoned calculator. It lacks complex mathematical functions and high-exponent input but you don't really need those all that often, do you? It's supported by advertisements up on the top because, hey, the author wants to get paid and that's cool.
B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|This is a beautiful, beautiful work. Riverside have outdone themselves with this one, and it is well worth the long wait between albums. I will be soaking this one up for a long time to come. There's really not much more I can say that hasn't been said in the thoughtful, well-written reviews by Gentlegiantprog or JP.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I adore this movie (and book). As for getting it on instant watch...quality was great. No sudden pauses for buffering or anything. Very happy.
0307455874|5.0|This was also a gift for my Mother.  I have not read this book,  but plan to.<br />I was happy that it also arrived in perfect condition,  and I would not hesitate to purchase more books<br />through Amazon.com
0765325950|5.0|This, sadly, is the last volume of the Wheel Of Time. It broke my heart when i heard that {James Oliver Rigney, Jr.} Robert Jordan had passed. I have been following the WoT since i was very young. I saw the first book on the bookshelf in 1999 when i was just six years old. I picked it up and read the book. I have been an avid reader since then, even begun writing several of my own. The Eye of The World began my Great Hunt(Adventure) that sent me spiraling out into the massively expansive world of fantasy fiction. In 2007 when Robert Jordan died i wondered wether or not the next person to take The Wheel of Time into their hands was going to hit the nail right on the head, or horribly mangle the nail when they should have never thought to pick up the hammer. Well, to all of you WoT fans, i think i can honestly say that i couldn't have done a better job with finding the right person that Harriet had. Brandon Sanderson hit the nail with the passion of a Aiel Dancing The Spears(Reference to series if you have not yet read it) and did as fine a job as one could have done without being Robert Jordan himself. I give this book a five star rating ONLY because i am limited to five stars. I have one request to those who read my review. Please refrain from reading this book if you have not yet read the first thirteen in the series. thank you.
1400082773|5.0|This was also a gift I purchased for someone else.  It was for my Mother,  so I will have the opportunity to read this book.<br />It arrived in perfect condition,  and I will purchase more books through Amazon

B00B2V66VS|2.0|great follow on to original. However, it need control work.<br />-sometimes doesn't recognize tilt left and right on zip line.<br />-carries over swipe right being recognized as jump straight bug from original.<br />-jumps can be delayed by 1-2 seconds causing you to jump when you don't want to or run into walls.<br />-upgrades appear to late to act on them and jump to get. them<br /><br />version not on sync with that of google play store
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book is amazing. This is my second Colleen Hoover book and I will be reading more! This book made me cry!
B0067LY4WG|3.0|I am not an expert on Leonard Cohen.  I'm catching up to his music backwards.  Sort of.  I became a huge fan after the Live in London album was released.  The tunes are classic, for sure, but in particular, his guitar player for that concert knocked me out.  Very Jerry Garcia-esque, which I'm into.  Anyway, I'm not sorry I purchased this album, and at the same time it didn't knock my socks off.  ***The song writing, as always, is fabulous....
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard is very easy to use and makes typing on my touch screen much easier. You can make changes in the style, color and layout which makes it more fun to use. Would highly recommend this to anyone.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like the ease of using this app. living in the Midwest out weather changes often and I am able to keep on top of it.
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|I like Big Fish games and after a few glitches I was able to download it on my Kindle with the help of the great people from Amazon.<br />I was in the 4th week of Bronchitis and my attention level was almost nil.  I decided to try the game and it was addictive.  Besides having a great colorful format, I found the puzzles easy enough not to get frustrated and complicated enough to present a slight challenge.  Of course I'm only on the first few and maybe they will get harder.  Either way, it was a great way to pass the time in my sick bed giving me something to do other than concentrate on my cough, body aches, etc.<br />I did a few &#34;challenges&#34; but my memory and concentration was not up to par so I skipped many of those for now.<br />I think it is a good way to pass time when you are sick, waiting on flights, bored in a hotel room, etc.  The pictures are very colorful and the designs are equally interesting.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent plot; very well-written, good editing with few typos &/or errors of any kind; well-developed characters; happy, satisfying ending. Thanks
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Just as good as the first one. Can't wait for the next - wish it was sooner. Happy reading to you.
B00A812HOS|4.0|Unknown Mortal Orchestra's self-titled debut was a surprisingly fresh and original psych-pop gem, filled with oddly danceable rhythms, fuzzed-out guitars, and playful, almost whimsical lyrics courtesy of lead singer and songwriter Ruban Nielson--all with a rather soulful vibe that set it apart from other modern psych-rockers. 'II' expands on that sound by adding even weirder, funkier beats and time signatures, as well as darker, more introspective lyrics, resulting in a uniquely tripped-out album that borrows from the past while sounding utterly unlike anything else out there, past or present, with an overall vibe that somehow manages to be both downbeat and upbeat at the same time.<br /><br />The first three tracks show just how much ground this band can cover in a short span. \\"From the Sun\\" is a freaky, isolation-themed song that, despite the dark, deadly-serious lyrics about loneliness (a recurring theme on the album), is still nearly impossible to not bob your head to its hip-hop beats. \\"Swim and Sleep (Like a Shark)\\" rides along on a simple, steady rhythm and dreamy, noodling riff that's become embedded in my brain, while the excellent 'So Good at Being in Trouble' sounds like a lost 60's Motown song, complete with soulful lead vocals from Nielson.<br /><br />Other highlights for me include the hypnotic \\"The Opposite of Afternoon,\\" with its wobbly, curlicue guitar lead, as well as the laid-back, atmospheric grooves of \\"Monki,\\" a mind-blower made for headphones. \\"Secret Xtians\\" closes the album on a mellow-yet-funkified note, capping off 40 minutes of some of the best and most unique psych music to reach my ears in quite a while.<br /><br />Whereas many modern psychedelic bands are content with aping the classic 60's garage \\"sound,\\" with throwaway, reverb-drenched lyrics that get buried in the mix, Unknown Mortal Orchestra acknowledge their influences while looking to the future, with lyrics that are original, at times even moving, and it seems to me that they're just now really hitting their groove. I for one can't wait to hear where they go next.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game because you don't have to be connected to the internet or wi-fi to play it so its great for the doctors office
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is fun and great to pass time. It is kinda hard to move up though. I. Would overall say 5 and tee recommend it to anyone.
0788859544|5.0|came quick, priced ok, was cute and made great christmas gift for lil girl, great quality and was very happy
B004J4WNL2|5.0|My son was an introvert, and this gave me unique insight. I have shared this book's ideas and with many people. Very good read. I wish it was required reading for  all teachers
B008NW67E0|4.0|Not quite as good as Sigh No More, and the sound is very similar -- nothing extremely different.  There are some tracks on this album I like a lot more than most on Sigh No More, such as &#34;Below My Feet&#34; and &#34;Lover of the Light&#34; but there are a few I skip over pretty often.  Still one of my favorite bands!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|If everything I order from goHastings is in perfect shape like this item,I would recommend them to anyone making an online purchase.They haven't failed me yet.If you're like me and missed the on-air broadcast,this is the best way to catch up.Original story,top-notch acting.
B0017R5UA0|5.0|I can honestly say that Fleet Foxes/Fleet Foxes was and is the best album of all time from one of the best bands of all time (may it rest in peace).  I'm really upset that Fleet Foxes broke up and the individual members started doing their own things.  Don't get me wrong, Father John Misty is one of my favorite bands now, but none of their individual acts compare to the power that is Fleet Foxes.  I love both this album and Helplessness Blues, though this one takes the cake.  It has more songs that I will constantly listen to, no matter what mood I'm in, without skipping over them.  It's amazing that it also comes with the Sun Giant EP!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Very good story line! The acting is also very good. I am looking forward to hopefully seeing the Season 2 of this show offered on Amazon.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Mumford & Sons really out-did themselves with this first album.  Every song is a work of art and really gets you fired up.  After listening to it I have been trying to purchase tickets to their nearby concerts, but they sell out in the first few seconds of the online ticket release.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|As Spock would say, \\"fascinating.\\"  Reminded me of the very early days of computer gaming, I.e. \\"text adventures,\\" and many of the Sierra games that followed.  Very enjoyable, and if you aren't old enough to remember those, try this for a \\"retro\\" experience - but keep in mind that the sound and visual quality are vastly superior to those old games!
B00536OCZA|5.0|The condition was described perfectly (Used: Like new really meant it had never been opened and was still in shrink-wrap!).  It was shipped in a timely fashion and is one of my favorite albums of all time!
B007VUCAVO|4.0|It's nice to see your battery level at a glance. The app is simple has a clever look to it.
B007PVHMCG|1.0|Legos are educational without a doubt.  Logic, math, problem solving skills, creativity...all used with legos.  And they are fun!  They don't break easy, and you can create entire worlds, buildings, vehicles, animals....endless possibility.  Minecraft is just digital legos....an open world building block program.  Don't get me wrong, it's addicting and fun... but at it's core its a world full of 4x4 lego bricks.  So here is my issue, why praise something in Lego treatment, when it's already legos?  Marvel I get...something not legos, becomes legos.  Ninja Turtles, same deal it's novel, and cute.  But taking 1 4x4 lego brick from a generic lego box, and sticking that exact same brick with a box labled \\"Minecraft\\" is insulting.  My child has tons of legos, and plays minecraft, and he's been building minecraft sets with his \\"normal\\" legos for the last year.  Now he's freaking out and hounding me to buy this set, and guess what? He already owns it 3x over.  Legos>Minecraft  Labeling legos as Minecraft is a cash grab and lego should be ashamed.
B000002AGN|5.0|What else is there to say? The late Dave Brubeck's masterpiece, A real gem that should be in every home.
034580404X|1.0|not even received the ordered book. if you do not have in stock then why selling and hold my $
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I would never have considered that a series about the help in an &#34;upper crust&#34; English home many years ago would be of any interest to me at all. After watching the first two in Series 1, I was hooked. The acting is extremely believable. It is also very interesting to watch their world change(as it certainly did in real life) and how these people dealt with it to remain relevant. Their customs and formality are foreign to me and therefore interesting. It is well worth the time to watch it and learn also.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is awsome there are zipplines ,mines,and lots of coins. I would suggest this game to any one its cool
B007IXWKUK|4.0|yea... this book is really hot and its something i could share with my friends that are girls... but see... the thing is this is not a reality... this kind of relationship i meant to say... its not something thats basically out there in a day to day prspective... but most people are really interested in the ones who are mostly normal... i just highly doubt that there would be a person of that young of an age whos that rich... i mean come on! get real!! all i am saying is that its a hot book but not meant for reality  purposes... it turns people on... but wheres the moral to the theme!!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|An addicting follow up to Game of Thrones that doesn't seem to lose any steam, and whose author plays ruthlessly on the reader's natural desire to keep main characters alive and well.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I believe that every child has had someone in their class who was this child -be it retardation, physical deformity, extreme poverty or just really awkward.  And the lesson is always the same.  An interaction with a \\"wonder\\", makes us a better person.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have read this book in exactly 8 hours..<br />I just couldn't let the book away..<br /><br />there are moments in this story that made me cry..<br /><br />This is the kind of book that remains with you some time...<br /><br />I would love to see this book on the big screen
B008602KQI|5.0|pretty cool movie... i havnt read the book, dont judge, but its still a cool movie... easy down load ...
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great story.  Having been involved in war from a different vantage point (strike/fighter aircraft), I find Chris's experiences unique and inspiring.  RIP.
B003Y5H574|5.0|I really liked this movie... very cute rainy day type movie... but it was worth the purchase... ... ... ..
145210655X|4.0|I got this for my husband for Father's Day last year, and he loved it! Our toddler likes it a lot, too, and he likes to point at the pictures and narrate them now. It's a fun gift for any Star Wars &#34;nerd&#34; in your life who has little ones. :~)
B000YHG72E|5.0|best movie ever... ok maybe not the best movie ever but it is a pretty awesome movie... i have to watch at least once a month

B0066WJLU6|5.0|I like this app. I wanted an app where I can get a flashlight so I can read in the morning or at night when everyone is asleep. I agree with the top review. You should totally get this app! Buy now!<br /><br />Bye!
030746363X|5.0|I learned a lot from this book.  Followed the diet and exercise in book and was pleasantly surprised with the result.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Loved it. Kinda sad though. But happy Amanda's son lived because of her true love Dawson. And she can feel his heart beat every time she hugs her son
0345803485|5.0|Love this Trilogy so much! Can't wait to watch the movie.  Every woman deserves to read this book at some point in their life!!
B004S5FW1U|5.0|Quirky, bittersweet and thoroughly entertaining. A very different boy meets girl story with a silver lining. The story has been substantially changed for the movie, so read the book first.
0345803507|5.0|Love this Trilogy so much! Can't wait to watch the movie.  Every woman deserves to read this book at some point in their life!!
B0043VDIAG|4.0|Typical chic lit fromNicholas Sparks. A little bit of intrigue and a lot of schmaltzy romance. What more could a girl want!<br />Perfect sunlounge literature.
B00846REIS|5.0|I would recommend anyone to purchase this book after reading Fifty Shades of Grey!! Absolutely love this book and author.
0740748475|5.0|I purchased this as a surprise for my husband. HE LOVES IT! All his boy friends ooh and aah when they catch a glimpse of this awesome set. Good quality. A must have.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|What an absolutely wonderful book.  I laughed, cried and connected to this book deeply.  I read it on my Kindle and ordered a paperback for a friend.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|The author captures you from the beginning of the book and you don't want to set it down. On to the next one.
B0081SPK0I|3.0|You know the idea is great and is fun and graphics are cool. But touchy controlls and so much going on kind of wears on you after a bit but give it a try you can always remove it if you don't like it.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|The best puzzle game out in our country in my opinion. I think it's as good as minecraft. . .
B007FJFDXS|4.0|The game itself takes some practice but it is kind of addicting as you play.  I like the way it works but at first I was ready to throw it out the window.  So don't give up its a fun challenge and a great time and mind killer.
B000W1V7K4|5.0|Much better than the second movie and enjoyable eye candy for all people and a great plot. Well acted and hilarious final airport scene.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|To me, Downton Abbey is a &#34;cool&#34; version of Pride & Prejudice. Yes, it's a lot of relational drama, but it's done so incredibly well (and to me, more interesting) in comparison to Pride & Prejudice. As a guy, Pride & Prejudice seems to be a bunch of women walking around talking. That's it. Downton Abbey is different in that it shows what's going on in the servants' area as well as with the lords and ladies, and the plot and character development is even better.<br /><br />Season 3 continues this trend and doesn't let up. The issues that began in previous seasons are continued (some finalized), and new, interesting issues arise. The acting, character development, and plot development continue to be top-notch. I'm looking forward to finishing this season and waiting on the next.<br /><br />A note about the TV Pass: I think it's worth it if you're a huge fan of the series, and could be considered a discount from having to purchase an entire season later, but it's not an incredible deal. A little bit of a deal, but not spectacular.
0679720200|5.0|I used this book in a graduate school course and was delighted with the story. What a great non-English/American piece of literature.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Although I feel this was not very well written, this book was quick read an  enjoyed the concept of Mr.Grey.

0812979656|4.0|This was a required book for an undergrad class. The author is a great writer and the book was of decent quality.
B00005AXKF|2.0|I wanted it for the DVD player at school where I work and it doesn't work on it - it will play on the computer - so not sure what the problem is.
0385474547|5.0|I used this book in a graduate school course and was delighted with the story. What a great non-English/American piece of literature.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|I really loved Born To Die and this is a great follow to that.  A bit more mellow, but still that beautiful haunting voice tone and great songwriting.  5 stars.
0321701763|5.0|I got this to use in a digital photography class. The book is very helpful and easy to understand at a basic level.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This is truly an absolutely awesome timeless love story.The historical aspect lends the characters an unforgettable place in the genre .<br />This is not my first time reading this BOOK and I have already recommended it to my friends.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The blu-ray version is crisp and clear. The movie itself is superbly acted and a thrill for any Batman lover.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is such a good game I would recommend it to anyone aged 7 and above. If I have no games to play I will always play this one it is a really good name
B0027MJU00|4.0|Gruesome, tragic, well thought out murder mystery with a successful surprise ending. Told from a variety of characters points of view. Kept me engaged to the end. I recommend this book to murder mystery lovers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is one of the best game out there. You get to be chased by a dog and a police officer. My favorite about the game is that they upgraded it to Rio!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|First book Mr King has written that was a good read in a very long time. Was not scary but really good.
B00782O7NE|1.0|I was unable to play DVD in Australia due to the UltraViolet Digital Copy!!!!  Can anyone help to make it clearer when purchasing DVD from the States
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My kids love it, I even enjoyed sitting down and watching it. Would definitely recommend this movie for all the Tinkerbell lovers.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I play it all the time. I love that I only need to tap a card and it usually goes where I want it.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|this was our first 3D movie and we loved it, it works well.  Some movie sequences are made to demonstrate the 3D capabilities and they do look awesome.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Had there been test-to-speech and had this been loan-able, I might have given this book 5 stars. At least when I first thought about buying it there was no TTS. Now it looks like it has TTS. Good! But still not loan-able. For the price that is ridiculous! No, it didn't have those amenities when I found a way to borrow it anyway; nor was it my kind of book. The whole series is man-heavy; war, blood, and an attitude that isn't of man's realm is less than. The females that were strong in their own right were never allowed to fly in their own way as they were still possessions of the male society. Dany and Arya were as close to being a unique beings as this world would allow.<br /><br />But in spite of my complaints, this was an excellent series. The author was amazing. The world he created was real, the characters so well developed that I feel I will miss many of them as friends. How he kept track of their voices and points of view amazes me.<br /><br />Even so, am I glad I am finished with this series? Yes! Um... except for the fact that I have to wait to find out what has happened to all of the people I did learn to care about.<br /><br />Is it worth reading? Yes. Is it worth the praise? I don't think so. If a book or series is to be a classic I think it should move the world to want to raise above war and self-centered machismo. This series has not done that. But you make up your own mind about it and we can agree to disagree about what makes a classic.
B00AE2IJIE|1.0|rented the movie on the Amazon to watch over the internet, however it would not play, it may not be Amazon's fault, maybe my smart TV not being very smart......we did not try customer service yet to fix the issue
B005LAII12|4.0|I bought this for someone as a gift.  He loved it, said it was hilarious.  As long as you have the right sense of humor for this type of movie, it's funny.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|It's a cute movie and has a good moral in it as well. Always love movies that teach values at the same time as entertaining children. Bought it for my nieces and ended up enjoying it myself as well.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|If you like Kelly Clarkson's music, I think you will enjoy this CD.  It's got all of her hits and a Christmas song.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Amazing movie, one heck of a deal at only $3.99 for the Black Friday special. I'd been wanting it for a while now and finally got it. Now the rest of my family can share the zombie love!
1934030597|5.0|Easy to read and understand with a sufficient quantity of illustrations and pictures so that the experienced home mechanic or bold newbie can repair/adjust just about anything on a mountain bike. It's up to date enough to cover hydraulic break maintenance and repair. Well done, Zinn!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I love this app. I use it all the time when I buy an album from Amazon or just anywhere and put it on ACP and it works so well and all the music that I put on there always goes straight to my phone and it is just a great app for that type of thing. It makes my life easier.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am enjoying playing solitare because it is a fun, interesting and relaxing way to unwind while playing this game.

B004ZGI2KK|5.0|Great movie.  You will never guess who it was.....no, I'm not going to tell you.  You have to watch it for yourself.  Great cast and very suspenseful.  I liked it a lot.
B009O2XY12|5.0|It takes alot of concentration to get the bubbles to pop where they are supposed to - lots of fun

B0074QGGK6|5.0|Inspiring. I really enjoy and found useful ideas here. It is a little too short but is very well written.
B005PK553C|5.0|This is a really creepy, scary show.  At times it is rather hard to follow, however it is worth watching anyway if you like that sort of thing.  One of the creepiest shows I've seen in a long time.
B004GVUPFE|3.0|I generally like these types of games, but I didn't like that the piece you had to move out was a square, or that there were a mixture of shapes.  It made it more challenging and frustrating.  Could be good for some people though.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This edition of LES MISERABLES is very readable and a good translation.  Thoroughly enjoying the book.  I would recommend it to lovers of literature.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|I haven't bought this particular CD yet, but I love the song. It sounds good. Pop with an orchestra. I hope to someday get a violin because of this song.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Once again,I liked every bit of this artist.If this artist comes to Australia.I will definately go to their concerts.<br />Very Very good

B0071XO8RA|4.0|I loved this book, had to buy the next omnibus collection at once. It was really hard to put it down until finished.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|it is pretty good..... i don't  go on it that much but when im bored it gives me something to do.
B005LAII1C|3.0|I was expecting more humor.. The concept is fine and the actors are really good, but<br />I laughed only once. I realize this was more adult themed, but not a movie I will keep, sorry to say.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is insanely awesome.I love this game and its a game to die for.<br />All you need to know is this game cannot be beat. Go have fun get this app if you want to have fun!!!!!!
B007KOYEOC|3.0|The book is not one of the best pieces of literature that I have ever read that's for sure, but unfortunately you get &#34;sucked&#34; into it and need to know what happens at the end of the trilogy.
0375842209|5.0|I read a lot of crime and mystery novels, but this one is a bit different! Its the only book I have read that talks from Deaths point of view! Really great!
B008DYZKQE|5.0|I purchased this for my six year old. She loved it! It was a fun read. I overheard her reading it to her brother, so its a keeper.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Ben Affleck did an awesome job at acting in this movie. I recommend this movie to absolutely everyone who enjoys war movies.
B007WFTFG6|2.0|You get one page for &#34;free&#34;.  If you want more you have to pay.  If the whole app is not free, they should just tell you up front.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|If you like super hero movies, you need to see this movie.<br />If you love super hero movies, you need to own this box set!
B004YW4L5K|3.0|This book and this author had been so highly recommended to me, I figured that I had to give it a read. I feel like I struggled through the book, almost like I was forcing myself to enjoy it, but was ultimately, truly rewarded it in the end. American Gods will create opinions and thoughts on some heavy topics -- it's a great book to talk about with others who are reading or have read it -- regardless of whether such ideas are valid by the end. There are some great themes in the book, Gaiman just may not have taken them to the full potential. Maybe the new HBO series will as it's slated for six seasons (this book does not have six seasons worth of material). As my headline says, I didn't enjoy reading it but I'm glad I read it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Beautiful! The best original seriest i've watched in a long time. I stongly recommend it to anyone that likes the older royalty days.

B005LAIHXQ|5.0|This film truly completes &#34;Full Circle&#34; the Allien saga...Having said this I would love to see another prequel w Noomi Rapace arriving in the planet of the giants.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|We downloaded this game for our 10 year old Grandson and he loved it. He played for at least 3 hours and didn't want to even stop for dinner.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Book 3 is awesome.  Takes turns you would never anticipate.  Fast moving, great storyline.  An awesome read.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical type novels and/or fantasy novels.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Great twists and turns.  I enjoyed this book.  A three star for me means definately worth reading but I wouldn't rave about it.  Most books I read would fall into this catagory.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|If your on the go this App is really nice for browsing Ebay. I use it alot when I dont have access to a PC
B00992CF6W|5.0|Sorry I accidentally put my opinion in the name box. I LOVE THIS GAME! It scared the crap out of me.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|This book is an inspiration. To know that someone can be so low and come out on the other side is heartwarming. It's a really good story!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Another excellent and well written book. It's amazing to see how he came so far with the love of a woman.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best  Masterpiece Classics.  My wife and I have really enjoyed watching all three seasons of this series.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|Jane Austen is very clever and as I read her books, I just waited to see what she or her characters would say next.<br />`
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoy Downton Abbey mostly for the costumes, hair, setting, and scenery. The story line, I have to admit, draws me in and keeps me wanting more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun. I like how u can buy new characters and boards.it's fun when u get new people. Over all I really like this game.
B00846REIS|5.0|Wow.I am now addicted. A must read.<br />Sylvia day..is amazing. I absolutely love how complex both the main characters are. This book puts all erotica to shame.
0385535147|3.0|Malcolm Bannister is halfway through a ten year prison sentence for money laundering, a crime he only technically and innocently committed.  When a federal judge is murdered, he senses an opportunity to obtain his freedom, because he knows who committed the crime and why.  Rules 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allows for a prisoner to be pardoned or have their sentence reduced if they can solve another crime.  His first challenge is getting the attention of the FBI, but eventually he is successful in negotiating his release from prison if the man that he accuses of the murder is indicted.  What appears to be a reasonably straightforward and only moderately interesting story becomes a lot more interesting when it becomes apparent that Malcolm has an entirely new agenda of his own and that his release from prison is only the first step of the plan.<br /><br />This had the potential to be a very interesting story but it is let down by the absence of characters that we care about and by the padding that stretches it out significantly longer than the storyline warrants.  There is a low level of suspense throughout, but not enough to maintain your interest as we follow Malcolm's everyday activities.  Malcolm himself - the narrator for the majority of the book - is never anyone who came to life for me.  The early chapters establish his back story and arouses our sympathy for him, but after that he just becomes a bit of a cipher who narrates everything with a sense of detachment.  His love interest (who emerges in the second half of the book) is equally bland - long legged, big breasted and good at running errands.<br /><br />The book held my interest, but only just.  Started very well but then got bogged down too deep for too long.
030758836X|5.0|You THINK you know what this book is about. You THINK you know how this story is going to progress. You're probably wrong because this story is filled with tons of little surprises and twists. Gillian Flynn keeps them so well hidden that you'll never be expecting them to happen. I picked this up because I have heard raved reviews about it. And it's true! It's an easy read- but don't read it before bed. You'll be having twisted dreams.

B0092QITO2|1.0|If there were an option for no stars, I would have selected that. This blu-ray disc has NUMEROUS audio dropouts through out the movie when using the TrueHD audio selection.<br /><br />After contacting Sony Home Entertainment Customer Support, they insisted that my blu-ray player needed a firmware update. I then contacted Sony Blu-ray Player service, noting that Sony Home Entertainment stated my player needed a firmware update for my Sony BDP-S560 blu-ray player. Sony support stated there is no firmware update for this issue.<br /><br />Not only is this happening with Sony's own blu-ray players but several other brands as well. I find it HIGHLY unusual that this is the only blu-ray disc out of the hundreds that I own that exhibits issue and it is not the fault of the disc.<br /><br />Sony began a disc exchange program but stopped offering the replacements. Apparently the replacement discs that Sony were sending out exhibited the same problems.<br /><br />Since Sony seems unwilling to address the issue with this defective disc, I returned the defective blu-ray movie.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's addictive.  I can't get enough of all the fast twists and turns.  You have to think fast while you're jumping and ducking.  I am always tripping or getting smoked by the flame or falling over the waterfalls or just the edge.  The gorilla is humongous, and when he catches up to you he shakes you like a rag doll.  It's awesome.

B003QSJVV2|4.0|This was a fun movie to watch for someone who likes cool cars and medium-action. Nicholas Cage gives a typical Nicholas Cage performance. There are some good chase scenes, some cool-but-not-over-the-top action, and it's not super violent or anything. There's also some nice lighthearted humour to keep things real.<br /><br />Overall, I give it 4 stars because the plot was pretty thin, and Angelina Jolie, despite being on the cover, plays a relatively insignificant role.
B005DKLPRE|4.0|I didn't buy this box set right away since I already own all the albums (multiple versions), but after reading the interviews with Johnny Marr, and the reviews on this site, I decided to spend the money.<br /><br />So, I own; the original Rough Trade pressings; the original US Sire pressings; the mid 2000 Rhino reissues; and, now these new Johnny Marr remasters (Why someone needs 4+ copies of the same record is a different story...).  I purchased the vinyl box set, and sat down to really compare these pressings.<br /><br />Equipment: Rega P3 table w/ Ortofon Bronze cartridge; Moon 340i Integrated Amplifier; B&W DM604 S3 Loudspeakers; and, a pair of Sennheiser HD800 headphones.  For this test, I utilized both the headphones and loudspeakers, and had the same results.<br /><br />For the sake of keeping this simple, I'm going to lump this into three separate categories: Original 80's presses; Mid 2000's Repress; and Current Remaster.  The original Rough Trade press sounds better than the Sire, so I am just going to really focus on the Original Rough Trade press as my 80's original.<br /><br />First up: The Queen is Dead - &#34;Frankly Mr Shankly&#34;.  I chose this song because Andy Rourke's bass tone is simply incredible, and the song does have a bit of variety.  On the Original Rough Trade and mid-2000's Rhino repress, his bass tone sounds identical across presses; it's clean, crisp and has that warm sound that is prevalent throughout this album.  The guitar work, drums and vocals sound pretty much identical as well across presses.  This is the version of the album I grew up on.  Now, on to the new remaster.  The first thing I noticed was the Rourke's bass tone has changed.  It has lost a bit of that &#34;edge&#34; it had in the earlier mixes, and is slightly less pronounced than before.  With the case of this album, I would prefer to listen to either the original Rough Trade or mid-2000s repress.  It's almost as if someone decided to turn the bass down on this album (I wonder why...)<br /><br />Next: Strangeways, Here we Come - &#34;A Rush and a Push and the Land is Ours&#34; & &#34;I Started Something I Couldn't Finish&#34;.  I decided to listen to these two songs back to back.  Honestly, I had a hard time picking out differences between the Rough Trade and mid-2000's repress.  They both sound great, as these are the versions I've heard the most.  When I put on the new Remaster, I could actually hear a subtle difference for the better.  The separation of instruments is more pronounced, and overall, it just feels &#34;fuller&#34;.  It had more &#34;umph&#34; overall, and when played loudly through my loudspeakers, it really shined.  If I had to pick a version for Strangeways, it would be the new Remaster.<br /><br />Next: Meat is Murder - &#34;The Headmaster Ritual&#34; & &#34;Rusholme Ruffians&#34;.  I started with the Rough Trade press, and then moved to the mid-2000's repress.  Between these two, the biggest difference was the volume level.  The original is definitely quieter (this was before the &#34;loudness wars&#34; ruined record mastering), but that isn't a bad thing: it just means you have to turn your amplifier up.  The Mid-2000's press was a bit too bright and loud.  I then put on the remaster and was glad to hear that that volume was restored to a normal level.  It was slightly louder than the original, but in no way was it as loud as the mid-2000's press.  If I had to pick a version here, I would go with the new Remaster since it most definitely sounds warmer/fuller, and the most noticeable difference is that Morrissey's vocals sound so clean.<br /><br />Last: The Smiths (debut) - &#34;Still Ill&#34;.  My favorite track off this album.  I started with the Rough Trade press, and then went to the mid-2000's press.  Between these two, the biggest difference is volume.  The latter is a tad louder (just as &#34;Meat is Murder&#34; was), but still sounds good.  When I put on the Remaster, what I noticed was similar to &#34;Meat is Murder&#34; above.  Morrissey's vocals sound smooth, and Rourke's bass is actually a little more pronounced in this mix compared to earlier (which is surprising!).  Marr's guitar is also a bit more pronounced in the mix (which is a good thing, since it was hidden by Morrissey's vocals during parts of the song).  They didn't change the way the song sounds, they just made it sound better.  Overall - I would pick the Remaster for this album.<br /><br />(Sorry, I didn't feel like going through the compilation albums, or &#34;Rank&#34; one by one, but the Remasters all sounded great.)<br /><br />Conclusion: If you don't have any of the original LP's, then this box would be a great way to pick up all the LP's at once.  If you have the original Rough Trade pressings (and they are still in good shape), then the price of this box might not be worth the subtle differences I was able to pick out.  I was hoping that the changes would be more noticeable, but unfortunately the differences I was able to hear were minor.  Yes, they are there, but for $225, I can't say if it was worth it.  I will keep this set since it is nice to have audiophile vinyl that doesn't have the use/abuse of 20+ year old records, and these will be the records I pull out to listen to when I have chance to sit down and really listen to these albums.#34;Meat is Murder&#34; above.

B003DZX44I|4.0|+ 5 Stars for the Movie<br /><br />Obviously, this is a great movie and it really is especially beautiful on Blu-Ray.  I love getting to see the extended version with the song “Human Again.”<br /><br />- 1 Star for the Special Features Layout<br /><br />The special features are laid out in a very unusual format.  Some of the special features are on the main disc with the film and the rest are on a second disc.  But there doesn’t appear to be any logical explanation for why it is divided in that way.  You click on a special feature documentary and it tells you to put the other disc in.  I had to switch it back and forth several times to get though all of the special features.  Sometimes the very same menu branch was split.  There is a guide in the case that is supposed to map out the special features on both discs, but I didn’t find it all that helpful.<br /><br />The special features themselves are very nice, but it would have been much better if all of them (with the exception of commentaries, etc.) were on one disc.

B0042VJ1PI|4.0|This second book in the Nikki Heat series is so much better than the first.  The characters are beginning to develop into something more like their &#34;Castle&#34; counterparts and the story is more complex.  Someone definitely put a little more time and thought into writing this one.  Totally worth the read for any &#34;Castle&#34; fan.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|My daughter read this story in school then they got to watch the movie. She bugged me for a year to get it for her and finally found it. She was sooooo excited! Grab the kleenex....you're gonna need them!
B002PEP4SC|3.0|Didn't seem long enough or in-depth enough.  Felt more like reading an episode of &#34;Castle&#34; than reading a novel.  I know the characters aren't supposed to be exactly like their &#34;Castle&#34; counterparts, but I still couldn't help trying to imagine the show characters saying the things the book characters were saying, and it frequently didn't fit (especially the Beckett/Heat character).  Once I convinced myself to stop expecting that, it got easier to read.  But still the whole book felt like an afterthought.  I must not be the only one to feel that way, because I've now read the rest of the series so far and each book gets more complex and the characters become much more &#34;Castle&#34;-like.

B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Inside A Discovery of Witches is the beginning of a good story, but to read it you also have to endure pages and pages of useless information.  One picks up a book to escape the boring and mundane of every day life, but it seems none of that was left out of this book. I feel like I know every stitch of clothing the main character has, including the ones she didn't wear, while the \\"action\\" parts were nondescript. I find myself wishing I'd borrowed this book from the library for sleepless nights as opposed to spending the money I could've easily bought several more enjoyable books with. Nonetheless, I still give it three stars because, though it was a slow read, I would've enjoyed the actual story if it weren't muddled with so many details that made the book drag.
B00AVTMCYW|3.0|I have not read \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower,\\" so I have no basis as to how the book compares to the movie. That said, I feel that this film suffers the same symptoms as many a book adaptation: far too many elements stuffed in to be dealt with adequately in the space of a film. Many people on here have already mentioned a lot of the good points, so I would just like to point out some of the things that didn't sit well with me.<br /><br />First off, I would like to say that I really did enjoy the first half of this film and I was drawn in by the characters far more than I expected to be. To be honest, I tend to avoid films about adolescence because I often feel isolated by them. So many high school dramas involve hard bodies in the their early or mid or late twenties and are all about their wild sexual endeavors, making high school seem more like some supermodel Beverly Hills coke party. Unfortunately, my high school experience was not like that at all: riddled with anxiety, insecurity, disappointment (and not much of anything sexy). So this film opened as a very pleasant surprise, showing very realistic characters with legitimate angst and problems that I and probably many others could relate to. The teens of the film, particularly the leads, are embodied through great performances by very gifted young actors. I found myself smiling often, feeling their pain and enjoying their triumphs.<br /><br />In the second half, however, I felt that the film almost completely lost its trajectory: certain issues got dragged out far too long, there were scenes that went nowhere, and story elements completely abandoned. There were even times when the film completely lost its realism and delved into pure fantasy. (Warning: spoilers)<br /><br />Here is an example: at the beginning of the film, Charlie mentions to Sam that his former best friend committed suicide. This of course causes Sam concern and she and Patrick officially welcome him into their group. After that scene, thesuicidal friend is never, ever mentioned again. I would think that of all the things that trouble Charlie's mind throughout the film, this friend would surely be one of them. Does Charlie ever wonder what his old friend would think of his new friends, what he would have been like in high school, what he would say about this or that? Does Charlie feel that he might possibly have prevented his friend's suicide and how he might have done it? If these things are on Charlie's mind, the movie never says. He does, however, think often on his deceased aunt and the possibility that her death might be his fault. I really feel that the movie should merely have focused on one of these defunct characters and left the other out. Couldn't he just have easily have told Sam that his aunt had died recently? I think that would have been much more consistent.<br /><br />The second half of the film is primarily focused on Charlie's attraction to Sam. He likes her, maybe she likes him, but she has a boyfriend. He likes her but later he has a girlfriend, which complicates things further. They share many special quiet moments together and even kiss once. Will they end up together, will they not end up together? Does she like him, does she not like him? This is so drawn out over so many similar scenes even though the conflict itself is pretty thin and it is perfectly obvious what the end result is going to be. Even with its focus on the alternative lifestyle of misfit adolescents, this film chooses as its main conflict a typical Jane Austen love game of \\"will they end up together or not,\\" hence qualifying it as a mainstream Hollywood film like the billion and a half others I have seen. Focusing on this issue again and again does not develop the characters any further, it is just teasing an attraction that everyone can see is there and is obviously going to be fulfilled in the end. I feel that there were far more interesting turns the movie could have taken and far more interesting issues itcould have explored. For instance, the character of Patrick. Here is a gay teen who has to deal with the difficulty of finding love in a homophobic environment, something many a gay teen could no doubt relate to. After a very ugly breakup with his closeted boyfriend, Charlie tries to console Patrick. Patrick, in his grief, suddenly kisses Charlie full on the mouth. Charlie then mentions that he hangs out with Patrick quite a bit more after that in the following days. But wait a minute! Wouldn't your gay friend kissing you full on the mouth have some kind of impact on your relationship? Would it make your relationship stronger, would you understand each other better, would it make things more awkward and uncomfortable? The movie does absolutely nothing with this. Relationships between gay friends and straight friends (at least of the same gender) has very seldom been explored in movies, and I personally would have found that far more interesting then the typical Hollywood footsie between Charlie and Sam.<br /><br />Speaking of Patrick's closeted boyfriend, this is where I felt the movie really abandoned reality and went into fantasy. Patrick gets into an all out fight with his boyfriend in the middle of the school cafeteria. Two of the boyfriend's big jock buddies hold Patrick's arms while a third delivers merciless gut punches. Sam tries to run to his aid but is held back, so Charlie...Charlie apparently blacks out and when he comes to, he finds that he has knocked two jocks twice his size out cold. Are you kidding me??? I assume that the blackout must have been where he momentarily turned into the Incredible Hulk. This, for me, was just fully unrealistic. Bullying is a difficult fact of life that many an outsider has to put up with, and I have no doubt that millions of victims have had many a fantasy about laying out their stronger, dumber tormentors. But how many have ever actually done it? How many people can honestly say that they knocked not one, but two of these brutes unconscious? While it likely has happened before, I would say that very few of us would truthfully be able to relate to that experience. Charlie could certainly have tried to stop them, maybe even have succeeded in stopping them, I just wish it would have been done more realistically without the burst of super strength. And after such an amazing feat, wouldn't he be a school hero, a school legend? Well, it is enough for him to get his friends back, but otherwise everyone just seems to kind of forget about it...<br /><br />As the film unfolds, we see Charlie progressing more and more, becoming less of a wallflower, growing as a person, as a writer, confessing his love and apparently finally ending up with Sam and just as the movie seems that it is about to wrap itself up...a full relapse into depression and suicidal tendencies. This sudden change comes almost at the end of the film and to me it fit in very awkwardly. I thought if he was going to rebound into his depression it should have happened much earlier in the film and been a bigger part of his character. Why, after all the progress he made, does this suddenly happen? As he gets therapy, we learn that his relationship with his deceased aunt may not have been fully appropriate, kind of like Sam's prepubescent trauma with her dad's boss. Though the story seems to sympathize with these characters and their struggles, it tries to shove in this sort of uncouth, 1950's psychoanalytical explanation of why they are such \\"misfits.\\" What makes someone an outsider? Being intelligent, being artistic or creative. NO, they were molested as children, of course! That just really seems like a cop out to me; an overly simplistic answer to very complicated issues. When you do not fit in it would almost be nice to have something like that to pin it on, kind of a free pass, but for many the answer is not so easy.<br /><br />To sum up, I really do understand why people like this movie and I do have to praise them for appealing to the kids for whom high school is not so fantastic. As I said, the actors gave it there all, they developed things well in the first half, but to me there were a lot of problems and let downs in the second half.

B00AGKHEUI|3.0|There's not much new from the first Rumours Deluxe set released a couple of years ago was fine. Disc 3 has pretty much the same darn stuff.<br /><br />I would prefer they had only Rumours tracks and in proper sequence for the 2nd disc. The disc just seems like filler. Obviously they didn't think it would be a good release on it's own!<br /><br />Fleetwood Mac, Rumours, and Tusk double-CD deluxe version released a couple of years ago were wonderful. Why don't they do the same with Mirage? Tango In The Night? or even older great albums like Mystery To Me, Bare Trees or Future Games.<br /><br />All in all, this feels like a greedy marketing grab. I'm going to pass on it.

B00AIBZM40|4.0|In theaters now, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Raven Devanney bravely went to see a screening of the new thriller/chiller, \\"Mama.\\" This PG-13 rated movie isn't for everyone, but if you are a fan of horror, and like to be scared silly, you shouldn't miss it. Though not the most original film, it packs a heavy fear-factor for every ghost-loving movie goer.<br /><br />Mama<br />Reviewed by Raven D, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic<br /><br />\\"Mama\\" tells the story of two young sisters, Lily and Victoria, who are abandoned in the woods for five years. When the girls are found and taken into custody by their uncle and his girlfriend Annabelle, everyone begins to wonder how these toddlers could have survived for so long on their own. The girls' strange behavior leads Annabell to believe that the girls weren't alone in the woods after all, and in fact, a troubled ghost called Mama was caring for them. But when they leave the forest, they don't leave Mama.<br /><br />I really enjoy this movie. It is definitely scary to watch, but when it is over it doesn't leave you feeling afraid. I'm convinced this movie is a mix between \\"The Woman in Black\\" and \\"The Possession.\\" It has a very similar ghost with the same motives as The Woman in Black, and has the same creepy bugs from \\"The Possession.\\" The ending is especially similar to \\"The Woman in Black.\\" No spoiler alerts or anything, but you think all will be fine but it's not. I guess you shouldn't go to a horror film if you're looking for a happy ending.<br /><br />I like the cinematography, and the use of lighting and sound track, to set the ominous mood for this film. The dull colors and grey wash of the scenery really helps the spook level of the movie. The one thing I have a real problem with was the animation of Mama's face in the last few scenes. This is supposed to be the height of the horror, the film's climax, but Mama's face is so unrealistic that it pulls me out of my horrified trance and I am no longer scared.<br /><br />My favorite character is Annabell (Jessica Chastain), because she isn't too enthusiastic about suddenly having to take on a motherly role, especially since the girls have serious social problems. Her boyfriend, the main caretaker of the kids, gets seriously injured, leaving Annabell in charge. I love watching her relationship develop into love for Lily and Victoria, and when Mama comes to play, she does a wonderful job showing her fear.<br /><br />My favorite scene is in the very beginning of the movie, when it shows how one-year-old Lily and three-year-old Victoria end up in the woods. It is a very twisted scene, but I like how they show the girls adapting to their new surroundings. They adapt through crayon drawings on the walls, which is very creative.<br /><br />I give Mama 4 out of 5 stars because it is definitely thrilling, but since it is so similar to some other films in this genre, I have to take a point away for lack of originality. I recommend \\"Mama\\" for ages 13 and up because of its intense content. If you're into anything Horror, Thriller or ghost related, then you'll love Mama so go check it out!<br /><br />Raven's video review available at kidsfirst dot org.character is Annabell (Jessica Chastain), because she isn't too enthusiastic about suddenly having to take on a motherly role, especially since the girls have serious social problems.

B008WCP2KG|5.0|The acting is awful (everyone but Channing, of course). But the dance scenes are to die for!!!! I actually saw this movie 3 times in theaters- I know, a little much. But it was worth it.
B009IJJ8UM|5.0|Johnny Lee Miller's characterization of a modern day Sherlock Holmes in \\"Elementary\\" is the best character portrayal on television today. Miller inhabits the role so thoroughly his portrayal as the heroin addicted, socially belligerent, crime sleuthing genius is by far the best drama crime series character since Vincent D'Onofrio's enigmatic performance as NYPD Detective Goren in the now concluded long running series Law & Order Criminal Intent.    In fact Miller is so good in the role I believe safe to say this may be one of the best drama characterizations in the history of television ranking with the likes of Peter Falk's Columbo for sheer mastery and loss of self within a role.    No matter how long the series continues to last, we are witnessing something that will stand the test of time and each individual episode stands alone as a complete viewing experience that can be watched again and again for more subtleties in each of the character portrayals. This is rare in television.    The use of well placed contemporary music in concluding scenes is especially effective in creating a mood and a feel of something that more closely resembles the ending of a movie than that of a television show. One is left with endings of power and completeness that are uplifting as well as whimsical, sudden and dark. No matter how they end you want more.    This show must be extremely challenging to write for as evidenced by Holmes' rapid fire, protracted, and complex dialog that has yet to wane throughout the entirety of the nascent series. Not to mention multiply layered interactions between characters, and stories that work exquisitely well in keeping one guessing, and finally an overall developmental arch between the lead characters that is exciting to anticipate. I'm rooting for these two.    I don't know how long this level of mastery and complexity can be maintained but I hope for a long time to come. No matter what, watch closely now, you are witnessing something brilliant.Greatness that comes around very, very, rarely.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Dexter is such an amazing show. I'm never disappointed. I've already placed my pre-order for season 7! This season is pretty differeent because it going into religion, which Dexter obviously could care less about. But it's still jsut as interesting. Unfortunately, I heard that season 8 might be the last season. :( Please say it isn't true!!!
0553328255|5.0|My daughter loves Sherlock Holmes, so this was perfect for her.  She likes her Kindle, but she really likes being able to hold the book she's reading.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It does the job and nice that it's portable. If you looking to really sharpen all you knives at home this is not it. However, it will get blades sharp to get things done. Speically if you in the field and need to sharpen you blade.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I love Daniel Craig and he does a great job in this new movie!  Lots of action, romance, chase scenes and believable scenarios!  Highly recommend!
B001EN71CW|5.0|If you haven't watched Firefly (or Serenity), please stop reading this review and go watch it. Now. You can thank me, and tens of thousands of Browncoats, later.<br /><br />-dr
B00B3MN65K|5.0|Classic Josh Groban but with a maturity that has finally found it's own identity. This is where he wants to be, straddled between multiple genres and with no clear theme for any album he puts together. Just GREAT songs that move you to want to listen over and over again and which compels you to own the whole album because you find there are multiple favorites among the tracks. This fits with who Josh Groban has been all along. Without Producers having such a heavy hand at steering the image of who he is, he is now producing this material on his own and this album is his best work yet! Where the melodic scores of \\"Illuminations\\"(his previous album) were dark and somber \\"All that Echoes\\"'s melodic scores are upbeat, happy, and beautiful. There is something for every type of Josh Groban Fan in this album making it comparable to his self-titled debut album \\"Josh Groban\\". There are slow pop songs for the easy listening crowd, in \\"The Moon is A Harsh Mistress\\" and \\"Happy in My Heartache\\" and \\"False Alarms\\"; edgier themes in \\"Hollow Talk\\" and \\"Below The Line\\" for the pop listener that doesn't go for sappy . For the classic Romantic \\"Un Alma Mas\\" and \\"Sincera\\" are flawless Josh Groban in his perfect command of languages. His choice of covers was impeccable in Stevie Wonder's \\"I Believe (When I Fall in Love it will be Forever)\\"and Webb's \\"The Moon is A Harsh Mistress\\". Worth buying for sure and spreading the word back to those who were less enthused about his previous album!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved the book,it was in my book club and we've been passing it around. I actually learned<br />quite a bit as well. really kept me turning the pages,hard to put down.
B005WYFLNU|2.0|I have no complaints with the product, stickers are sturdy and my 2.5 year old loves playing with it.  The content though is horrendous. Seriously, a beauty pageant and wedding scene? I'm used to all the princess stuff but this was over the top. Can't we have some scenes with kids going to school or playing in the snow or something? Disappointed in Melissa and Doug for this one.
B00338QENI|1.0|Very disappointed not a good read,sample was misleading for me. I kept reading in hopes it would improve<br />actually skipped pages just to get to the end.
B007BZM30M|5.0|Enjoy listening to this song as a single purchase for my collection.  Listen to it often and like the song.
B000002G0P|5.0|One of my favorite albums. The music is not that of a rock band - although it rocks hard - but of a brilliant composer. The messages of the lyrics are deep to the point they demand heavy introspection.
B00867GHS8|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite videos on Blue-Ray 3D! It has such great quality and looks amazing on a Tv with 3D capabilities. It also looks much better than 3D in the theaters.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|The movie was good, a tad predictable, bt I don't know a movie that isn't anymore. Really enjoyed it it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|great game to pass the time and my daughter can't get enough lol. this one is a must have for parents
B005Z271Y6|5.0|What a disc!  The sound quality at the Royal Albert Hall is stunning on my surround sound system.  Adele's rendition of the Bonnie Raitt classic &#34;I can't make you love me&#34; is better than Bonnie's!  Simply stunning vocals and Adele's band is spot on.  The engineer who mixed this disc is a genius.<br /><br />This has become a reference blu-ray disc for my system.  I have tested a number of tweaks (like isolate it sorbothane hemispheres) using this disc.  It's that good.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A great show, interesting characters different plot lines and in a time where class made a difference. It's hard to believe that people were this small minded.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|A pretty good app to have on your smartphone to access documents, PDFs, excel sheets, etc. I have tried other applications and they do not always correctly resize or format the file to something that is viewable. So I have this application on top of others to make sure I can access all the general files that I receive. It is pretty easy to use and compatible with most files which in my opinion are the key features that make it good to have.
B001E45XT4|4.0|When I bought this headset, I was a little low on cash. I needed them because I was and am an avid player of mmorpgs. The sound quality was on par with most headsets. Enough to make you feel the music, but not enough to really get you into it. Voices came across crisp, as my voice came across the mic as &#34;clear-ish&#34; with only occasional problems with static. However I don't believe the static had to do with the mic.<br /><br />The only quarrel I had with these was the fact that after wearing them for 2+ hours (I play WoW and our raid groups run for 4+ hours at a time) they made my ears hurt. Not the ear drum, but the outside ear. I had to constantly re-position them after a half hour or so.<br /><br />Would I recommend these to other mmorpgers? The simplest answer = Yes. If you are on a budget and still need to be able to communicate and listen to others in an easy manner with a headset that you're not to worried about.<br /><br />If you have a larger bankroll look deeper in spending $20+ for a set of Turtle Beach (which I use now) to be in the utmost of comfortability.
0765325950|2.0|what a boring ending to such an exciting series! It feels like many people are giving this book a positive review just because they have stuck with the novels over the many years. It felt as if the writing style and rhythm of the final installment deviates form that of the previous novels. This is an ending for the sake of having an ending.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it needs immortal powers but it just takes all your coins away other than that I LOVE it .it ROCKS!!!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Can't believe this was #2 on the NYT bestsellers list. I found myself skipping over so much of the book....looking for some great plot. The message about sexual abuse is valid but it was such a lame, juvenile story.
B000803PKY|4.0|The DVD audio disk sounds spectacular. Sounds are all around you. The regular CD sounds better than the original CD did when it first came out, but some of the crowd sounds, especially before running on empty begins are edited out and I don't care for that.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|We started watching season 1 on Netflix.  We had to figure out how to access season two without getting cable.  My brother told me about Amazon.  This is a excellent way to be selective in what shows you watch.  This show keeps us on our toes.  I cannot wait for the next episode.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Absolutely love this new interpretation of a classic. Fantastic characters. I have watched them over and over again. Come on Season 3!
B0074V3712|5.0|I approached this book with an acute interest in early human life and a recommendation from a friend, but, as someone who went to film school, I was worried that my high school-level knowledge of the natural sciences would be insufficient in fully understanding and appreciating the book. Fortunately, this was far from the truth. Wilson does a fantastic job of thoroughly exploring the origins of human social structure, often acting as a storyteller without sacrificing scientific depth or facts.
B004132HZS|5.0|So glad my daughter found this one. Great characters; fantastic take on the classic story. The only problem is waiting for the next season.
6305428050|5.0|I love this movie that was made during the 80s. It is not like some movies today. it is clean cut and funny.
1616614609|4.0|Very enjoyable two player, but it takes a bit to figure out.  Read read read... and then read more online.  Its more fun if the player can hold a bluff and are able to match wits persistently.  :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love  this  game! It's so much fun, especially when I'm on a long drive. It's challenging enough to hold my attention, and becomes quite addictive after a while. I've got all my friends playing it too now.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|My alarm clock broke and I don't feel like buying a new one. I thought why not just look in the app store and see if it has any alarm clocks. I didn't know which one to choose.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I like Clancy books, especialy the Jack Ryan Novels, and I look forward to more.  When is the next one comming out?
B00A8ECU24|5.0|definitely a fun game if you like my little pony- the little character improvement games get a little repetative but its good all around anyhow :)
B009IEXKXI|3.0|While I enjoyed the book, it was a bit too predictable, the author didn't take the time needed for a good ending, and the book needs better editing.  The grammatical and other errors interrupted the flow of the book and that is annoying.  Why is it so hard to get a book proofread properly?  Definitely not a 5 star book - I find it really strange that there are so many 5 star reviews.  For 99 cents I got my money's worth in entertainment...but I feel that the book could have been a 4 star read with some fine-tuning and proper attention paid to the ending.  Even with a predictable conclusion to the story it would have gotten a 4th star from me if it just wasn't so abruptly concluded.  I kept going back a page to see if I accidentally skipped forward.  One minute you are in the midst of the resolution, and the next you are months or years into the future with a 20 second scene and bam, book is over.  Odd.  I think he got tired of writing this story or had a deadline to make and added a page or two to the end and moved on to the next project.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is an amazing book! Can't wait for the movie! I sure hope the movie is half as good as the book.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Liked the previous efforts -- all of them. This one is dull. One-third of the way through and still just setting things up. Boring. Corey, as other readers know is purposely insufferable but this time it is so over the top that it goes well past irreverence to the point that you want to skip over his dialogue. DeMille has made him into a pathetic hack. There is no mystery, surprise  or real humor.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Back when this first came out, I was skeptical at the concept/story.  If you like Family Guy, you'll like this.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Poorly written and sometimes hard to follow.  I learned little that was not already in the newspapers.  The author should not quit his day job.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This was a great climax to the many disks that preceded it to create the Avengers series. I was not sure how the new Hulk character would fit in with this group but he was a hit over and over again.
B0098VXE50|5.0|This movie is amazing .. I love it the best movie ever you are awesome for making this movie god bless
B000L212HC|5.0|If you are a big fan of Chistopher Nolan as I am you don't want to overlook this movie to complete your collection of his works.
B00782O7IY|2.0|From the looks of it, this is a very popular movie.  In addition, it is supposed to contain the subtleties of French humor.  So we were extremely disappointed by the whole experience:  it is ridiculously melodramatic (a love story across the divide of success), everything is exaggerated to the point that it edges out all humor (the dog is the best character of all), and the plot is nothing but stereotype (a has-been struggles and gets a chance through the girl he once helped by chance).  For the life of me, I can't see why anyone would think this is an artistic masterpiece.<br /><br />This is a complete bore, never hits a good emotional note, and not funny.  Not recommended.
B001RXB4FY|5.0|I discovered this band at Rock on the Range last year and wow have I been a fan ever since. I will keep buying more of their albums till I have got them all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. Subway surfers is a super fun and addicting game that really keeps you wanting to play. I would definitely recommend this game, especially people who love temple run. Subway surfers is like that, but 10x better. Completely worth buying.
B004EPYZV2|4.0|I think this should be the last in this series. The characters are getting tired and need to be put to rest and a new series started.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|in my opinion it is better than the first one. because you add so many more aspects to the game
B0068FYZ3Y|5.0|I bought this just to keep upgrading my DVD collection to Blu-ray on movies that I watch often. Really glad I picked this one to upgrade because its better in BD than ever.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|It still get tears when I watch it.  The special effects are still off the hook and I still get chills when the ship hits the iceberg.  My Dad, an old coast guard, told me the sound of the ice sounds just like the ice breaking when he was at the North Pole.  6 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009YP9L7U|1.0|There are several sense from the famous FSoG. Same story line just mixed up a little. Flow of the writing was sometimes hard to keep up with. I would not recommend this book if you have read Fifty Shades of Grey trio.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|An inspirational documentary about Sixto Rodriguez, a humble, and hugely talented, poet and musician from Detroit. Also an indictment of the music industry, but it's done subtly, by the music industry execs themselves. Rodriquez, an exceptional poet and musician, has lived a simpler-than-simple life as a hard laborer. I saw him on 60 Minutes a couple of months ago, and on the Jeff Probst show within the past week, where--when asked about his lifestyle now--he said he lives below his means. Even now. (People still do that? Who knew.) If an artist knows his/her passion changed one person? A rush. Finding out that you personally influenced the downfall of Apartheid when you didn't even know your music had made its way to South Africa? Description-defying. Bigger than Elvis, bigger than the Beatles, bigger than the Rolling Stones, but only in South Africa? It's a mystery. Where did his royalties from several distributors here and abroad end up? As of last week, he still didn't know. This one-hanky production--I was smiling, too--left me reinvigorated about people in general, and definitely a Rodriguez fan. I hope his story encourages people to pursue their own creative passions...whether or not they know anybody is listening, reading, watching.
B0081BU42O|5.0|And a plethora of other large words. I loved this novel.  9 more words required to submit this review - DONE.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|Worked for a couple days then told me I would have to download more to get it to work... deleted!
B0001GL3K4|4.0|Love this movie! Just kind of a feel good chick flick around the holidays. I would recommend this to anyone who likes romantic comedies.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have not had any problems with the game and love having more games to work for. Such a variety.
B002ZCY7SW|4.0|It's okay.  I liked the CTU unit set-up much better.  You can tell that season 8 would be the final season.....nothing left to the imagination.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Thought this game would not be all that great but it had turned into quite an addiction. My boyfriend and I are constantly trying to beat eachother's scores.
B001J9AQA0|5.0|Love this!! So happy I purchased it. Love more than just &#34;Breakeven,&#34; which is the reason I bought this album.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its like I'm playing my cello while riding a rainbow with my pet unicorn while he is playing handbells when I play this game. you can guess it pretty awesome
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best temple run game ever. The zip line,cart,and bigger monkey. Just makes this game even better than I could imagine.<br /> Must get game. You will never be bored again!!!!!!!!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS is my favorite show, but unfortunately, I don't get to watch it every week.  It's great to be able to see the show whenever I have the time, without the stupid commercials, through Amazon Instant Video.  Then I can keep up with what's going on with my favorite characters on the show, namely Gibbs!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a great quick read.  So many ups and downs it will keep you guessing what's next.  But through every twist and turn you have Sky and Holder.  Two great characters!  A definite must read!!
B005U9QVPE|5.0|This is a pretty dark Jim Henson. It's a great story but has a lot of strange characters. It's kind of like the muppets meets the neverending story with a dark twist.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This was a great, quick read.  Can't wait to see the movie.  I'd like to read Mathew Quick's other books
B00932A4XE|5.0|This was a good movie but it didn't quite hit the real funny bone. It tried very hard to be really funny but just didn't hit the mark. Worth watching though.
0061692034|1.0|I heard a woman on NBR rave about this book.  I was so anxious to read it and it was such a boring, slow moving read. Who are the people that decide that a book is a hit?  They really blew it this time.
B00B9366VO|5.0|This was AWESOME. Dave Grohl is a fricking Rock God, he did a really good job on this and i enjoyed every minute of it. This is something would watch again. The history on of all those bands was very interesting and i learned things i never knew. A+++++++++
B009AMAM9S|5.0|Watching this film created in me the rarest of cinematic experiences--the immediate desire to see it again.  Today I'm buying this DVD.<br /><br />This film was often dismissed for facile and formalist reasons.  Like any actually serious art (as opposed to the critics' fave du jour), Cloud Atlas challenged its audience's expectations.
B005IQZB14|2.0|Great story. Cheryl Strayer spends a lot of time weaving her history through out her journey. I was left hanging when the story ended though. I wanted to know more about how her life turned out. A chapter on this instead of a few paragraphs would have been perfect. I was also a little surprised how candidly she discussed her heroin use.
B000002O4X|5.0|Had owned it previously and wanted a new copy. I really love the music from this movie. I play it often.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a fun and engaging game that will rank up ther with Anry Birds Star Wars for me.  Its a great free game that anyone would like.
0061906220|5.0|This is the first book from Pete the cat we purchased and it was my mistake we bumped into it... But I absolutely love it and my girls who are almost 3yrs old memorized the book! Its a great way to remember colors, and its a fun book!!
B008J34466|5.0|I love Pink and she just keeps putting out some great music. I really enjoy listening to this and cannot wait to see her in concert in March!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I liked the style of Vince Flynn, he lets the reader join in the strory by allowing the use of imagination, and forethought. well done!<br /> Alan
0345803507|5.0|Need I say more? I couldn't put this book down until it was D-O-N-E! Then, I passed it along to friends and even my mom .. lol
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This was an excellent read. It was fast paced and kept my attention. I liked the style and the characters. If you like adventure then you will love this book.
0345803493|5.0|Need I say more? I couldn't put this book down until it was D-O-N-E! Then, I passed it along to friends and even my mom .. lol
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very good and realistic app. It is fun for older and younger people. It never gets boring
0345803485|5.0|Need I say more? I couldn't put this book down until it was D-O-N-E! Then, I passed it along to friends and even my mom .. lol
B005BGBPBG|4.0|I liked this movie when I first saw it - I particularly like its stars, Ginnifer Goodwin and Kate Hudson. The character played by Ginnifer has to grow some courage in this movie - and that journey is what gives this movie its hook.  It definitely is a feel good romantic comedy. Kate Hudson doesn't develope a wide range for her character, but havent we all known people like that? In the end all is as it should be. Even though that doesn't usually happen in real life - it can happen very satisfactorily on the screen - and isn't that what movie magic is all about?
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This was the best book I have ever read. Most people have read, been told, watched (on TV) the actions of US Navy Seals but never do you hear of their lives outside the uniform. The writer gave you an insight to what made CPO Brown FEARLESS. I have recommend this book to everyone I know.  BRAVO ZULU to Mr. Blehm on his work.
1451620829|5.0|I have always been a fan of KISS and especially Peter Criss. His music and KISS's is the best. The book did shock me a little bit, with the details of his out-of-control life, but i loved the book as he was honest about everything the good,bad and the ugly side of stardom. Especially about his deep love for his lovely wife and extended family. He has turned his life around and i can't wait to buy some more of his albums. Thank You Amazon.
B00683JK9K|5.0|This is a great buy, lots of great quality pictures and 4 options for difficulty, you can also choose to have rotate on or off which adds another level to the game. I love this puzzle pack and defiantly recommend it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It really draws you into the way of life that these people had. I love that you get the views of the servants as well as the aristocratic family.
B00BB9PVQM|5.0|listen if people believe this to be gothic they need to pay attention its all about a story perffffect casting good vs evil thing is great i believe that what see in the news isnt half as bad as what we can see on tv if you watch alot if real tv shows they show more and its real if you cant stomach the truth on how our society is today this show isnt for you!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I'm hooked on hidden objects games and by far this one has been the most interesting and challenging.  I truly recommended it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game<br />If ur not good at temple run this game is for u<br />Its great for children<br />I love love it<br />1 of my fav games
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It`s super addicting, I'm  surprised I didn't play until midnight last Saturday.<br />I love Carmin`s outfit it's not just chartreuse,  it's also kind of like a turquoise, and the feathers, OMG, it ties the outfit together, and I love how fast the game gets after a while. I was so flabbergasted when I had enough to unlock Carmin, after I did I played for hours! Again, I LOVE this game.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is sooo cool n fun. I love it so much. My only issue is that i can only play for a haf hour or so before my energy runs low. I also wish there was a faster way to get gems. I cant even afford to buy gems bcuz u dont get enuf. Very cool game tho.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|For anyone who likes history, Doris Goodwin is your author.  I had trouble putting down this book once I began.  There is always such good research in Goodwin's books and she allows the reader to visit the main subject in his informal best.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|I love my movie. I can't wait till I own the whole collection, which should be very soon. You could say I'm Smallville obsessed.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|A meaty book.  Over 600 pages but I have learned so much I didn't know about the interaction of our past presidents from Truman forward.  It sheds a revealing light on Nixon, and gives Herbert Hoover a bump-up historically.
B005PTYP70|5.0|I grew up watching these movies, can't believe I own them all now. I love Tom Cruise, except as a Vampire...lol.
B004UFEJW6|4.0|Science fiction or extreme military film on human stupidity. Worth watching if only for the lovely Connie Nielson or for its special effects 15 years ago.
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|I was so excited to hear that the Kindle Fire finally got this game so I downloaded it but it would lag and freeze for a few seconds which made it difficult to play. But go ahead give it a try just remember my review about the lag. (P.S I undownloaded it)
B0090O07S2|4.0|This is quite well produced, yielding an entirely acceptable picture and sound. My personal opinion, and always a Jim Morrison issue, is that perhaps had the cameramen not spent so much time photographing his crotch Morrison would not have become so enamored of his own &#34;equipment&#34;. He also would have keep his welcome at a number of venues!
B009ZQTD7Q|1.0|I watched this film shortly after reading the book. I absolutely loved the book, this movie cut too much from the book and changed a few key aspects. I spent most of the movie shaking my head.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I have already reviewed this show, having loved it in London and also Melbourne.(i was in the audience on the night it was filmed). We are all absolutely entitled to differing opinions, but I feel the need to comment on 2 of the one star comments.  1). I thought it was wrong to discuss the full plot without reference to a &#34; spoiler&#34; alert.<br />2)  Andrew L-W personally approved and guided the production, proclaiming it to be the version he envisioned.<br />(thats what he said to the audience on the night of filming). It is, I believe, to be the official version to tour the UK and, ultimately, Broadway.  Pretty powerful stuff - some people didn't like it, but the creator does!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|It was great to finally get some answers from the book. Good read. Cannot wait for the next book. Good job.
B0029O0BLS|4.0|Until recently, \\"Sphere\\" was my favorite book. I read it in the mid-90s, when I was a teenager, and was ecstatic when I saw they were making a movie. Sure, the movie's slow as heck, but the atmosphere is extraordinary. I don't know what it is about this movie. I can't say I can watch it over and over, but it is worth watching at least once. Elliot Goldenthal's music is perfect for the film, as well. I couldn't have asked for a better adaptation of one of my favorite books.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|A great live performance from one of the world's greatest rock/blues band. I wish they would tour more often. 28 years is a long time to wait for a live performance from Zeppelin, but it was indeed worth it!<br /><br />My favorites: Good Times, Bad Times, Black Dog. No Quarter, Since I've Been Lovin' you, Kashmir and Stairway to Heaven.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book has a great storyline and I couldn't put it down! Highly suggest this book if you are looking for something you can't put down.
B004C0WVP6|5.0|I have 4 of these in a FreeNAS box, they have been running 24/7 for over a year with the occasional power off for maintenance when I moved. Couldn't be happier and I'm actually surprised by the amount of negative reviews. Crazy thing is I bought these locally on sale for $69 each before the flood in Thailand. Looks like prices are still not back to normal...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun, addictive, and challenging! Very worth the while=) just click that download button!;)<br />I would definitely play this anytime. I absolutely love the themes!!! =)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I enjoy this game. Great graphics. The horses are good looking and even feeding time shows up well. I really really like it.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Downloaded this free piano master game to my kindle.<br />have enjoyed playing it,  I would recommend for any age group.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|ADELE WILL CONTINUE TO BE A FAV OF MINE...SHE HAS A VOICE I ONLY WISH I HAD, AND THE HEART I KNOW I HAVE....SHE BRINGS ME AROUND WHEN MY SADNESS DROPS IN...BUT THIS COMPLETE CD IS AWESOME...I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|These books are &#34;romance novels&#34; and nothing more. Poorly written and their only redeeming quality is that they concern sadistic sexual practices!  Apparently a lot of people disagree with me because they were bestsellers.  The first book in the trilogy was more than enough - but three books like this were extremely tiresome!  Let's face it - there are only so many ways to have sex even if it is sadistic and painful and it doesn't require three books to describe it!
B00A80SHFM|4.0|Love the music.  Just disappointed there are a few songs missing.  Wish it had included them all.  But all in all, I am satisfied.
B0028KF4M4|5.0|I love Dexter, and couldn't find this particular episode anywhere free online. Video quality was good through Amazon, and it was nice to be able to view it instantly from my computer.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved it. I love period pieces. I always take in the backgrounds & see if there is anything there I would decorate my home with. I have bought many a furniture item or as my husband says WHATKNOTS from shows like this. Love the Victorian. Can't wait to see the whole thing.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|Great Xbox style controller none of the problems other users got except the dead zones but that was in the Menu bar and not much of an issue
B008FYZIVY|5.0|If you enjoyed season 1 and season 2 you will enjoy season 3.  Very memorizing, costuming is spot on, LOVE the players, LOVE the castle it is filmed in.
B009YU62H2|4.0|Nothing groundbreaking here, but so good to hear new music by Soundgarden.  A solid album from Soundgarden is better than most of the music out there today,  Cornell still one of the greatest rock vocalists ever.  They've definitely been away too long.  Good to have them back.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|This is a fun game.  Starts to get really challenging at level 5.  I highly recommend it to people that enjoy mactching games.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Fun and challenging but unable to find all the hidden charms to complete the game.  I'm Still working on that.
B000X2H8G4|2.0|This item has feedback interference more often than other brands I've used before in the past is not good for hearing impaired!
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Needs more explanation of how to create the vehicles but is challenging.  I am not real fond of this game.,
B001D07Q9E|1.0|Not within region.  Should have been told in ad.  I had to return it.  So disappointed that it did not work in Kansas
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This Angry Birds release starts easy and gets more difficult as you go.  Good addition to the Angry Birds library.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My sister made me get this game because she is extremely addicted to it. I found that I also love it and it is addicting (except when you have to wait for a dragon to hatch). Another thing is that you don't need a Facebook account for this app you can just bypass it and continue to play.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|This is a fun Birds game and challenges you to find that perfect spot to clear three stars.  Good fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE subway surfers it is so fun I love the graphics its a  really really fun game!!:)It cool because u can do so many cool things on it like u can buy different people!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun because it just like temple run but much more fun! You should buy this game because it awesome and it is free
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|this apps takes all of the music you have downloaded with money, and all of the songs and videos you have downloaded by using a free app! Amazing
B008AWBQGW|5.0|I have alwat been a fan of Lynyrd Skynyrd...There music is very down home...the Southern Rock is, my kind of music.
B007V65R54|5.0|Makes statistics understandable ---- no small feat.<br />Covers politics and sports making great comparisons...<br />Written in a very casual and comfortable style--- an easy read.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|It's a great drama, with good twists and likable characters. I especially love Saul and crazy nutty Carrie. Best TV show in a while.
859037985X|5.0|The book is just what you need, no matter you program in Lua for a long time or you just need something to start programming in it. It starts with basics and evolves deep into most advanced topics of language. My interest in this book was mostly to read about changes from version 5.1 to 5.2, especially C API part. And i got what i expected. I'd recommend this book to anyone who use or plan to use the Lua language. The overall quality and completeness of the feed of information in book is fine. Roberto Ierusalimschy is one of Lua authors, so it's no wonder. I use Lua in my projects and it's very extensive and delightful experience. Recommended!
B004EPYZOO|1.0|Many of the older DVD's are  Subtitles with SDH, which means TV Guardian will NOT take out the fowl language-this is a do-not buy for me and after recieving I threw where  it belongs,,in the garbage
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Very nicely designed and manufactured. Lots of thought went into the arrangement of straps and zippers/belts and such. Easy to use and it can really accommodate a lot of equipment. Pleasant to carry on reasonable length trips.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|I liked the horse and the game (except I didn't want to buy gems). But on my Kindle Fire, the game would get stuck on the first loading screen after playing the game just a few times (same day). Even reinstalling didn't help. I gave up on oit.
B00683JK9K|4.0|Don't believe people complaining about pieces going missing. If you leave them on a big chunk of the puzzle and accidentally grab  the big chunk, it will come to the front covering the little piece. You just have to move the big chunk out of your way temporarily to find missing pieces.<br /><br />Other than that its pretty user friendly: select picture, select number of pieces, start. I love that it has an option to only show edge pieces.<br /><br />My only complaint is that there is only a fairly small selection of pictures for just one category, seasons. They are pretty, but I'd like more variation.
1603427244|5.0|This is such a great book ... and I never knew it existed!  Soooo many ways to cast on and off, depending on the place in your project.  For 40 years I've been applying only one cast on and one cast off ... look what I've been missing!  I feel like apologizing to all the projects that didn't look 'quite right'.<br /><br />There is another book that says over 200 ways ... but I suspect that's a bit of overkill ... I mean,  TWO HUNDRED?  This little book is just perfect ... and small enough to tote around with you without feeling encumbered.  Highly recommend!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|She watched them in power mode.  Just watched one right after another.<br /><br />From my perspective it was:<br />- Very clear video.<br />- Very clear audio.<br />- A truly great experience to view.<br />- A bit more fast paced than some of the other BBC type things she likes to watch.<br /><br />Other than that nothing to add.  But my wife does suggest it to everyone looking for something new to watch.
B00A9X9VAI|5.0|What a great film.  So excited to own it.  One of the best time travel films ever made.  The best &#34;future&#34; film since Blade Runner.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|She watched them in power mode.

B000JMKTLO|5.0|Wow. This was a great book! It took me a little time to get into it, to care about the characters, but once I did, I was hooked! This was such a good book, such fantastic twists and turns! I found myself putting off everything else so I could go to my room and read!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|For all you haters, I LOVE this game. It's an amazing game that's a little bit harder than the first one. But, hard is good. So listen up you haters, this is a great game.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I thought the writing was excellent but the story line was really out there.  The ending was unsatisfying in that Flynn left her main character in a hopeless situation that was bizarre to begin with.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game i think is so fun u get to take care of pets by feeding them , playing ball ,  and washing them . It is definitely 5star worthy
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Although I was a bit skeptical because mainstream sci-fi movies tend to miss the mark, this movie was well done and had a great plot along with a surprise ending. They also somehow made Joseph gordon-levvit look exactly like Bruce Willis which was pretty cool!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I don't write reviews. But this adaptation of the Holme's mythology is remarkable. Can't wait for the next episode. Evan the seeming old cliche plots get unexpected twists. And Holmes and Watson are an amazing casting coup. Wonderful.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I could watch this non stop!  Unfortunately I do have to go to work.  Love! Love! Love!  Walt is the man!
B00A80SHFM|4.0|You'd be able to hear the songs from the film in order and they have excellent quality too. Listening to this CD brings you back to the film. What I wished for is the Little Fall of Rain by Samantha Bark which is not included in this CD and thus my 4 stars only. That song during the film was excellent that it made me wonder why they would exclude it in this CD.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Husband loved the series and he is happy to have this product. The clarity and sound is great. I would recommend this product.
B003BKF696|5.0|besides the quck shipping and good price this album is a real winner!  A killer band with a killer release here.  Many great songs, not just BLOODBUZZ OHIO, which is what attracted me tgo this band.  This is a killer album!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have the original Temple Run game and like it a lot but have never gotten really good at it. Temple Run 2 has a few more tips and tricks right at the beginning making it easier for me to get further in the game before splatting into a tree or jumping to my death off a cliff. This game makes me laugh out loud as my guy runs through - or into ;-) - the various challenges. Total guilt-free entertainment!
B000UJ48XG|5.0|I love beirut's &#34; the Rip Tide Album&#34; so I decided to check out this one.  It is awesome and no let down.  The shipping was great, as is the price.  check this one out!
1476715904|5.0|After randomly finding and enjoying Hoover's 'Hopeless', when searching for something to read, i was hoping that her other offerings were just as riveting; i was wrong...Slammed (and Point of Retreat) is even better.<br /><br />Hoover has the ability to develop characters and plots that immediately drag her readers in and she, in my opinion, is as good as two of my favoured established YA and children's literature authors: Melina Marchetta and Ursula Dubosarsky.<br /><br />Slammed (and POR) is no Twilight (yay): it has substance; well thought out and believable themes and plot lines; and deeply developed believable characters. As a reader you'll be experiencing a multitude of emotions as Hoover gracefully guides you through Lake's emotionally tumultuous last year of high school as she experiences more blows to her heart than any young person should endure. Real life can suck and Hoover doesn't shy away from reality; her storyline and characters are so believable that one can't help but emotionally invest.<br /><br />Good literature, whether it be young adult, adult or children's literature is worth reading at any age and Hoover's works have the ability to reach across the age barrier and suck you in.  You won't be able to put this book and its sequel down; i couldn't! I'll be waiting with anticipation for Hoover's next offering because i know it will be worth reading.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun game! It is sometimes slow on my kindle but it doesn't really affect the way its suppose to be played.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'd never heard of Colleen Hoover before and found this book while randomly searching for something to read. I'm a fan of well written literature whether it be adult, young adult/teen or children's literature and i wasn't disappointed with Hoover's offering.<br /><br />Hoover has the ability to develop her characters and plot with deep dimension that can't help but invest her readers to the point of not putting down the book. I was reading till dawn; i just couldn't leave Sky and Holder.<br /><br />This book isn't just a love story, it's a slice of real life with twists and turns; i cried, I laughed, I smiled, I hurt, right along with Sky and Holder - only a well written book can do that.<br /><br />As soon as i'd finished this book, i went searching for more Colleen Hoover offerings...and i wasn't disappointed. Hopeless was a fabulous book, but Slammed and Point of Retreat are even better. This author knows how to write!
B00632HWOG|4.0|Really didn't need this for the cell but it was good for the kindle.  Makes it fit the screen and saves a little time with the whole process.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|I bought it for my daughter's boyfriend. He immediately said the speed was so much better when using this adapter.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|If you love a good Love Story this is the movies to watch. Vampire movies are usually gorey, but this puts a different approach on live no matter who you are.  It shows that different people, cultures and beliefs can learn to love and love deeply.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|I bought it for my daughter's boyfriend. He told me the speed improved a lot. If you are working on the computer a lot and use multiple devices, I recommend it.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille at his best. My favorite author and he doesn't disappoint.John Corey up to his usual sense of humor.A good read
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The book made you think about what people had to go thru in the South if they where not free and how loyal they where to each other. so loyal that they would die for each other.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|I downloaded the update and I look on and ALL MY PROGRESS IS GONE!!! I wish I could give it zero stars!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The book makes you think about having a person that cares for you can make all the difference in your life.
B001GMQE7E|3.0|... try as I might, when downloaded into iTunes Track 4 insists on appearing by itself<br />I just cannot seem to consolidate into one album!?<br />Other than that - this is superb piano, very relaxing
B00683JK9K|2.0|some people said pieces are missing, they are not and you have to find them, they are usually under the puzzle and you have to move it to the side to see em. this game would be much better if they had more puzzles
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|I cant believe how hard, but fun this game is.  I got it for free as the download of the day, and I wasn't expecting anything fun.  I cant put it down.  This app is worth paying for!
B007ZTLLMK|2.0|its interesting but unfortunately this type of game is not what i like to do these days and prefer other types of amusement on my phone
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game... Love it on my Kindle. I love the World Tour stuff and characters. Everyone should get this game!!!
006197806X|4.0|Lauren Oliver, unlike lots of authors, knows how to write a sequel thats just as engaging and fast-paced as the first book. I'm glad that she could keep her writing strong while still telling an interesting story--and let me tell you, this story was just that!<br /><br />The chapters alternate between 'then' and 'now'. It slowly gives away what happens to Lena in the Wilds, and at the same time, what's going on now. At first it was a little confusing, but I slowly got used to it. I think that it was much more interesting set up this way than in chronological order.<br /><br />You can really see Lena's character changing before your eyes. Alex's &#34;death&#34; has taken a toll on her, and it shows in both her words and actions. She starts out as almost like a zombie, and slowly, as she becomes accustomed to resistance, she grows into a strong, confident young woman. These 'then' chapters were critical in showing her character arc. It's funny how so little of the Lena we learned to love in DELIRIUM showed up in PANDEMONIUM. She's practically a brand new person.<br /><br />The one thing that bothered me was the horrible, dreaded YA love triangle. Don't get me wrong, I am all for love triangles. It's just that I completely love both of the boys--Alex and Julian--and so does Lena, so I have no idea what's going to happen in the next book. The last page of the book left me on the edge of my seat, and I'm eagerly awaiting for the release of REQUIEM next month!<br /><br />Lauren Oliver's writing style is so unique, so that if I read any of her writing, I'd know exactly who it was. It's lyrical and beautifully executed. Most of the plot twists were a surprise, but as I read on, I realized that they were necessary and exactly what needed to be written. I think that this book was paced perfectly. To some, it might seem a little slow, but I thought that it was perfect. All the characters acted realistically.<br /><br />I don't know if Lena substituted Alex's love in the form of Julian. He just seems like someone who Lena can close her eyes and pretend that she's kissing Alex. They spent so little time together--but all of that time was life-threatening and exhilarating--so I can honestly say I have no idea what Lauren Oliver is going to do next. There's no doubt that I will be picking up the last installment when it's published in March!
B000009ED0|2.0|But not this cd! I have become a huge fan of his music...my favorites are Rock and Roll Jesus and Born Free...but not this one.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Can't put it down! Just when I think I understand the characters... another twist is added. It is very entertaining with Flynn's engrossing characters and style of writing.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It had a bit of a slow start, but once you got about halfway thru it, it was really good.  I think this book would make a great movie.
0062238868|5.0|Chris Kyle was an American Hero who saved the lives of many of our men and women in uniform. He died doing what he has done his entire military career and subsequent private life, helping a veteran with PTSD. The same man that he was trying to help cowardly killed Mr.Kyle while at a gun range in February 2013. May Chris Kyle R.I P and thank you for your service to our nation. God bless the USA.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really good read.  I think it would make a great movie. I had a hard time putting it down.  Whoever said keep your kindle charged was totally right.
B004X8W4A4|3.0|The story is good, although a little short for my taste. It's filled with details that every Castle fan will enjoy, a lot of callbacks to episodes of the show.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|The connection was terrible, the movie slow which was a catastrophic combination that made the experience very unsatisfactory and tedious.
0345803485|1.0|After hearing about this book for the two years or so, I was hesitant to read it as I never read NY Best Sellers.  This book sucked.  I don't know how to say this any better.  The erotica or lack of was very elementary and just was not good at all.  I don't see what all the hype was about and I am sorry I wasted three evenings of mine reading this garbage.  Please save yourself some time and find another book.  This one sucked.
B007K3JCAE|3.0|Not to shabby action flick. At times the dialog is a bit hard to discern from the sound effects. I adjusted the center speaker volume up and dialed back the surround speakers and all is well.<br /><br />I think the best modern version of the Watson and Holmes adventures is &#34;A Seven Percent Solution&#34;. I also recommed &#34;Young Sherlock Holmes&#34;. Although not for the very young amoung us.<br /><br />The video qualilty in &#34;A game of Shadows&#34; was very good.<br /><br />The movie was fun to watch, although very predictable plot and expected action sequences. No big surprises.
B009CPES4I|5.0|Turn up the volume and be sure you don't miss the clever one-liners.  The movie is at it's best in the beginning...slows down just a bit toward the end.  But overall, a fun evening of movie-watching.
B004LZFWJO|3.0|I can not pass from the first level although I have scored above 3500, there is no access to choose the diferent levels
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was an easy to read, attention grabber. The characters are real and relatable yet so different from anyone I've encountered in my life.. I could not put the book down. It's a... MUST READ!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really liked this book. It shows courage and its a great love story too. Its full of action! This book is one of the only books that I have been able to read all the way through. Its one of those books that you pick up and never want to put down. I have read it 3 times already. This book is like the movie but it has a few extra parts. Im getting the 2nd book now.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Fun game. Some what easy to play and follow. Great clues that return fast ---not long time to wait.<br />Would recommend. Looking forward to a second game.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|First of all, I am editing my previous review, which can be seen below (at your own risk).<br /><br />Yes, the HD version is only available to everything but a desktop PC (which is still one of the stupidest things that Amazon has done), however, I was finally able to watch the standard version of this very entertaining movie, and what can I say--go ahead and check it out!<br /><br />It's got all of the same Bond action, excitement, espionage, romance, and surprises that you'd expect from any Bond film.  There's even a few clever nods to previous Bond films, which are not hard to miss.  I could go into more detail, but why spoil this splendid movie for you?  Five stars!<br /><br />**Previous review:**<br />Amazon.com will rip you off if you try to watch the HD version via the website's player.  They force you to watch the standard version, and that doesn't even work!  The standard version's link will take you to an Amazon.com 404 page, \\"Uh-oh, not found!\\"<br /><br />Again, we have an example of marketing at its worst.  They try to make it look as if you can watch the movie in HD on the site, however, when you click the link, they say, \\"Woops!  The HD version is only available to these particular devices that pay us money to have priority over people like you, the desktop PC user.\\"  Do not purchase the digital version!  I repeat, DO NOT PURCHASE THE DIGITAL VERSION!<br /><br />...there IS NO DIGITAL VERSION!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|The Dark Knight series was one of the better portrayals. Minor annoyances like the scruff voice, etc...But great overall. Definitely Recommended!
B004WJRF6C|5.0|When McCartney released his self-produced solo album in 1970 it's spareness, his self-sufficiency, and the genuine sense love it radiated touched me. For some reason, &#34;Every Night&#34; was running through me head and I decided to buy the CD. Glad I did.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|The crash scene in this movie is every frequent flyers nightmare. The fact that Boeing is in the news for issues with new plany and Sully's magical landing in the hudson makes this a movie that not only seems realistic (It is almos the exact scenario as Alaska Flight 261 crashing into the pacific going inverted)but the story line keeps you into the movie until the end. any negative review is just anti-Denzel. Do not miss this one.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I got the first game when I got into it but when I got the second one I also got into it but the next day I started the game it wont let me play so I re installed the game which fixed the problem but the same thing happened again.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love Mitch Rapp books and this one didn't disappoint either. Keep up the good work - look forward to the next
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read the previous twelve Mitch Rapp novels and this one is one of the best. An absolute &#34;page turner&#34; right from the start. When  I was done, I wanted more! Needless to say, I am looking forward Mr. Flynn's 14th edition of Mitch Rapp&#62;
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|A mostly pleasant gentle read with insight into the human psyche through various characters in the book. Enjoyable as well as a geographical jaunt through the UK
B00B2EWNWG|5.0|like all the action and the actors I had known before. This is good for all to see..lots of action
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever. Bad graphics but you could make anything you want craft weapons and a lot more. Definitely worth it.
B00AHQNHSY|4.0|Very good products.  Seems to play just about any sort of video file.  Tiny improvements needed......for free, can't beat it.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Loved the game. Wish it was longer. Challenging yet still fun. Graphics are awesome and places are fun to get to.
B007KDFWRG|4.0|I knew of Derek Trucks from his work with the Allman Brothers.  I hear a lot of Duane and Dickey in him but he has his own nuances which I really like.  I bought this album solely because I fell in love with &#34;Midnight in Harlem&#34; as I heard them perform it on Clapton's Crossroads.  Their performance prompted me to buy the Blu Ray of Crossroads and their Tedeschi Trucks Band Live CD.  Derek's solo along with his wife Susan's vocals are great, but Derek's solo truly moves me every time I hear this track.  I give that track alone 5 stars and it is now one of my all time favorites.  Tedeschi's vocals are good and I didn't realize how good she really is, I am now a fan.  The rest of the live album's tracks are good but not the level of 'Midnight', but then how could they be?  (My opinion only.)
B00499LTLM|5.0|What more needs to be said? This is the perfect adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes stories. It's witty, cleverly updated to modern times, and the casting is PHENOMENAL.<br /><br />LOVE IT.
B0015XHP3Q|5.0|This 3rd installment keeps you in the edge of your seat! lots of action and more! Two thumbs up! A must have.
B0041L0Z1S|4.0|I agree with most of the other reviews. If you love BBC and the recent Pride and Prejudice movie, this is a good choice.<br /><br />I do agree that it was a bit slow in the beginning and middle, especially as you're waiting for problems to resolve and for Emma to be reasonable already, but it was fun and pleasant.<br />Other versions of Emma I've seen make Emma seem a bit too mean-spirited, and I thought this version struck a good balance of making her just naive and a bit self-centered, rather than actually snotty or mean.
B0015XHP3G|5.0|If you couldn't get enough of First Blood, Rambo II will definitely satisfy your hunger for action! Plus it looks awesome on Blu-Ray
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Better than most horse games for my kindle. Slightly addicting. My big complaint is that it takeaway to long to earn diamonds,plus'and hearts. It takes so long that I probably will quit playing after a few days. It's too bad because otherwise I would want to keep it.
0425263908|3.0|The book was okay and it was written desent but I was hoping for more. I compare all adult books I read to Gabriel's Inferno and Gabriel's Rapture by Sylvain Reynard... In my mind I enjoyed the 50's series more then the Crossfire series.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It was very nice to wake up on time for once in my life always getting late to school and work
0425263916|3.0|The writing was good but I was expecting more.  After reading a handful of books the past 6 months I have been comparing them all to Gabriel's Inferno and Gabriel's Rapture by Sylvain. Honestly, maybe if the books had a longer stroy line ( add 50 pages or so) maybe it would have cured my need for more???
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I got this app thinking it would be like a virtual pet and boy was I wrong, this game takes forever to download and is very confusing. I don't recommend it.
0061122416|5.0|I understand why Will Smith loves this book. Outside of it being a great read the story is very inspirational and motivating. If you believe your life is suppose to be more than average give this book a read.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I probably use this app more than any other app I have. This is a must have for any one who travels or works outside. Weather at your finger tips. Another great tool. Thanks.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game if you are patient to wait tor the coins to build up.  no instruction so you are on your own to discover the ins and outs which can be half the fun!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I absolutely love this clock. Very easy to set up . Very easy to use and operate . The dimmer is great just slide your finger down the screen and the clock will dim. The alarm is so easy to set up. Great job on this program.
B000002H97|5.0|This is their best album hands down. I did not receive the free mp3 copy with this that I usually do with cds bought on Amazon, but I loaded it anyways so we are good.
B00AFWEPVI|5.0|Finally something that really works and I highly suggest this app to everyone to enjoy. Thanks for a great tool.
B009H442DG|5.0|I got this as a gift for a friend that loves these guys together. But the perk was that I got a digital copy as well for just the purchase from Amazon and I have gotten to enjoy the music as well.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|it takes up over 1kb of space, but other than that, i absolutely love this game! i mean you will have to play a few levels over to buy things, but you DO NOT have to purchase items you R/L cash! that i love
0783230079|5.0|I just love Elizabeth Shue so this movie was an absolute must. But overall, this is a great movie to watch with the family.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|The author makes what seems like a complicated subject easy just wish it was a little longer and had a few more examples
B00683JK9K|5.0|Okay I really like the puzzles. It is laggy and freezes on my samsung galaxy player. The samsung player only has 800mhz processor, so beware before download. No missing pieces. I found also that pieces did not even need to be flipped or rotated. That feature can make this puzzle way too easy. I did enjoy the classical music. I also enjoyed that it wasn't one of those apps that you have to make a lot of quick descions.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really enjoy the challenge and the different ways to play. I like the help button and that I can come  and keep playing.
1439130833|5.0|I like that it gives you a lesson for everyday to practice!! Definitely I would recommend for others to read.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|This movie was very cute. I was bored, and since I've always loved fairy tales I decided to rent it online. I was glad that I did.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This has been the most intriguing book series I have ever read. This is a definite must read for both men women and couples to spice up their relationship. Can't wait to read want this writer comes up with next.
0765325950|4.0|It is now over. After twenty years, and though Sanderson spent a good deal of time bringing this tale to a conclusion, this book made the epic last battle overly complex.<br /><br />I think almost every character that had lived through to this book had a line, a mention so you would know whether they lived or died, and most you would be able to fill in the blanks on what they were to do next. For some you had to extrapolate, while some characters died who you thought would surely live and some lived who you thought might die.<br /><br />Yet amongst those who lived, almost all our favorite gold shirts did, so some of the drama was taken away. And that there were so many to tell about, this last battle was nearly the entire book, so some of the complexity of plot was diminished. Where that had been what drove this series forward.<br /><br />When Jordan had gone from a trilogy (Remember when this was going to be a trilogy, and then four books, and then no more than five books...) the depth of plots became ginormous. It was what made the series so interesting. And here, the last battle, good versus evil, forces you to really and finally choose which side to fight on then. Get that battle over with and you can return to all the plans and doings.<br /><br />As we neared the end though, and in the prologue, you see that some things do not hold up and not enough attention is given to solving such matters. If food all over the land is spoiled so there is nothing to eat, people starve and they do so quite quickly. Sanderson gets trapped here and never really solves this. He seems to feed his army, but what of the many people who never left there homes faced with no edible food? They would perish. Logic says that someone should have called this out and some plot lines either laid down by Jordan or developed by Sanderson should have been cut.<br /><br />That they were not leaves that question hanging and makes me think that this was not tightly done. Nor the continued overrunning of the known world by the enemy forcing all the armies to one place. Yet for thousands of years the enemy has always been going to come at the allies from one direction and why not have the last battle where that had initially been planned. Generals will tell you never fight a two front war, and thus they must really hate a three front war. But one that has more than three should be impossible.<br /><br />That there is the last battle between the forces of men and others, and one between our uber-hero Rand, and the Dark One, would be more than enough. That so much of the climactic fighting had to be through a description that I found hard to relate to the two most powerful of spell casters meant to me that this too could have been worked on. I think back to TSRs War of the Wizards game so long ago. To a description by Katherine Kurtz in her Deryni books of wizards fighting and think that would have been much more relevant than how this battle progressed.<br /><br />If this was the way that Jordan envisioned his final struggle being portrayed, it also goes against many of the battles by those who could cast spells before. It goes against the sword training that Rand has related in his physical side. To me, it did not work.<br /><br />But again, it is over. Finished. I would have wanted more of the development of the characters, and less of this battle that had gone on and on and on. One day I will reread it all. Now, I can put it on my shelf and move onto something else.ng of the known world by the enemy forcing all the armies to one place.

B0060MYM7O|5.0|I no longer bother with writing reviews of any kind, however this Series is so beyond special, that I feel compelled to do so, if only to reaffirm the masses and wake the ones who have not yet followed this series.<br />The novel written by George R.R. Martin is already a timeless and treasured \\"Must Read\\" series of books (5 so far, with a 6th being written) is a fictional journey that has been loosely compared to the breathtaking adventures of Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit, but be warned this story is not for children. It is absolutely for mature audiences only. The HBO translation and depiction of this story is mostly accurate to the books (so far) and therefore most readers will be very pleased with the video interpretations of the novel, but I for one am very thankful for both.<br />The violence, nudity and sexual situations are NOT gratuitous and obligatory, but are very heavy at times. Aside from that I consider this series to be the best mature audience adventure ever and the story, characters, and cinematic landscapes will absolutely astonish and amaze the audience into loyal obsession.<br />If I had any complaint at all it would be that 10 episodes per season are not enough and the waiting between seasons is agonizing. Book 3, for example, will have to be told in 2 Full Seasons which means it will take almost 3 years to watch. I'm therefore assuming this entire story will take over 10 years to complete. I wonder if the audience loyalty is patient enough and especially I wonder if HBO is successful enough to complete it without running into budget issues like so many other series seem to do. It would be devastating to watch 50-70% of the story only to end it abruptly and prematurely leaving the loyal audience hanging (like they did with 'Deadwood', which I'm still upset over, due to HBO being unable to sustain growing actor salary demands and costs)<br />This concern however, is nowhere near enough for me to rate this anything less that a FULL 5+ Stars and consider it an absolute marvel of novel and theatrical entertainment.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|One of the greats. I have always loved this movie. The story is wonderful. Very happy it is now in my collection
1582701709|5.0|I have the video... But it is a great book! I would recommend this book to anyone for them to read.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|Obviously, the book needs to be read first, but I feel like this movie really lived up to the expectations of readers. The cast is so amazingly in sync with my ideas on the book and I didn't stop smiling the whole movie (except when I was crying). Truly worthy of my money and time.
B004A8ZWSS|3.0|I wished it had told me the case cover was a reprint of some sort. It didn't look very good and looks a little blurry. And some of the plastic edges are cracked. But the disc was fine.
B000I0RNVG|1.0|There are 2 DVDs in this set and one says Original and the other Director's Cut. But they are EXACTLY the SAME MOVIE !!<br />There was no quality control on this item and now I have to send it back .  If you order this you RISK getting ripped off.
B009NT4D8E|5.0|Oh boy i love this.....I really do. Gives hope to dummies like me who didnt know what to think when i 1st saw it. And after watching it 100 times i really can say i understand alot about the regular film.Now with the added information things are even brighter. you have a fan forever over this film 20th Century Fox. Please do a Prometheus 2 i want more information....An A+++++ from me...  PS. You WILL need a blue ray DVD player for all but one of the discs. That being said it is well worth the money.....
B00B47NO2O|3.0|I really liked the basic concept -- a brilliant but deranged serial killer has developed an army of sleepers who continue to execute his plan despite being caught. When you think about the potential of how warped it can get, it's a clever formula that pushes the boundaries of procedural cop TV drama.<br /><br />Unfortunately, rather than the main bad guy building a cult through religion or some political point of view, it centers around the writings of Edgar Allen Poe. Actually, it really centers around The Raven since the writers were too lazy to read anything else he wrote and have kept the references to what the average Fox viewer might have seen from a Simpsons Halloween special. And we're really suspending our disbelief here since our English-teacher-slash-killer has brainwashed his followers into very complicated crimes based upon some lectures on some arcane analysis of Poe's literature. Seriously? I'll buy into Homeland's brainwashed military hero turning to terrorism just because it's great television but this is like suggesting that readers of The Oatmeal are going to start murdering badgers.<br /><br />That aside, the show has quickly descended into \\"nutjob of the week\\" territory and the overarching story line of the season isn't going anywhere fast. Bacon's tormented brilliant-but-alcoholic-investigator character gets less interesting with every episode. The writers seem to have forgotten the alcoholism problem completely and now it's simply a cat and mouse game between the hero and villain who are essentially opposite parts of the same person. If Homeland became ridiculous when Carrie discovered she was crazy, The Following jumps straight into absurdity with the main character's supposed weakness.<br /><br />The crimes each week are really, really unbelievable. The followers show a near-telepathic level of prediction when it comes to breaking into people's houses and being able to act on highly detailed maniacal plans despite the main architect operating from a prison cell. It also reruns every horror movie cliche to the point where you know there's going to be a killer behind someone when they close the bathroom mirror. Although the extreme gore is there to make all this look very serious, I find myself laughing at each plot twist since I have as much luck convincing you to steal a pack of gum with this review as the killer has of making any of this happen through his Poe obsession.<br /><br />Basically, The Following just reminds me how mediocre network programming is compared with cable shows like Dexter and Homeland. There was a great idea at the core of this series that has been wasted and given the laziness of the plot, I'm not confident that I'll be watching many more episodes.g from a prison cell.

B00B2V66VS|3.0|love the game but I cant get in the game. its a fun game. I got to play it a couple of time but now I cant get in at all. it stinks.
B001N44BVQ|3.0|Mostly happy! Got here faster then i expected and the DVD was in great shape but some of the plastic on the top of the case was breaking. So the case is a little more flimsy and broken then i'd like for something i ordered in &#34;Good condition&#34; But other then that i guess i'm happy.
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|the 5 stars is for what is here rather than deducted for what is missing.<br /><br />Disc 1:  The Remaster<br /><br />to my ears, it sounds exactly like the 2004 remaster, which is excellent already.  the only difference is Silver Springs is added to the end of side 2 instead of end of side 1.<br /><br />Disc 2:  Live 1977<br /><br />the Mac now have 4 official live cds:  1980 Fleetwood Mac Live (the Tusk tour),  1997 The Dance (w/3 additional tracks on the Silver Springs single cd), a 2003 10 track bonus cd included with the 2 disc Live in Boston dvd & now this one.<br /><br />i am happy to hear & have these 12 tracks from 1977.  here is the young Mac at there prime.  later tours, they become more polished & the recording quality of course improves, but it's great to hear them young.  Oh Daddy & Songbird only appear here officially,  The Chain, Gold Dust Woman & World Turning are omitted from the 1980 cd  and Don't Stop 1980 is a sound check version.<br /><br />i like this 1977 Go Your Own Way better than the 1980 version because it's 1 minute tighter.<br /><br />i agree with other reviewers who said they would have liked to have a whole show instead of just 12 songs, but i have to accept what i can get.<br /><br />Disc 3:  The Demos<br /><br />This is where this set gets interesting and worth the price of admission.  Overall, the demos released in 2004 are rough mixes without overdubs.  Here, the demos are generally earlier takes.  Clear from this is that the lead guitar parts are usually added last.  I also offer my own subjective rating for the value of each track either for quality or how revelatory or unusual it is.<br /><br />1. Second Hand News (early take, acoustic demo), A, a true early demo of vocal & acoustic guitar.  already the energy of the song is here.  the 2004 is more like an early mix sounding much like the final song.<br /><br />2. Dreams (take 2, solo demo), A, lovely Stevie vocal with electric rhythm guitar, no drums. the 2004 demo again is close to the final song with the drums.<br /><br />3. Never Going Back Again (acoustic duet), A+, this is outstanding.  very interesting to hear Stevie adding sparse backing vocals.  also has a bongo track.<br /><br />4. Go Your Own Way (early take), A+.  the song in mid-development.  sounds close to the final but without the lead guitar.  the vocals are an early version with a very different \\"you can roll like thunder\\" in place of \\"you can call it another lonely day\\". the 2004 demo is a later alternate version.<br /><br />5. Songbird (demo), A, a simply lovely early take.  2004 rough is a later, alternate mix.<br /><br />6. Songbird (instrumental, take 10), A, piano track only.<br /><br />7. I Don't Wanna Know (early take), A+.  outstanding track with Lindsey doing the guide vocal for Stevie with electric rhythm guitar.  this track really reveals how Lindsey sculpts the songs of his bandmates.<br /><br />8. Keep Me There (instrumental), B, demo track here of an average unreleased song, but interesting because the last 90 seconds later becomes the end of The Chain.<br /><br />9. The Chain (acoustic demo), A, a major revelation here.  this is the Stevie demo of a generally unremarkable song which most likely Lindsey transformed into the powerhouse track of The Chain.<br /><br />10. Keep Me There (vocal), B, an unreleased ok song but again the ending becomes the ending for The Chain.<br /><br />11. Gold Dust Woman (early take), A, similiar to the final with an alternate vocal take and without overdubs.  the 2004 release has 2 more interesting versions, including an acoustic demo.<br /><br />12. Oh Daddy (early take), A, definitely a very early working demo where you can hear Christine calling out musical changes.  the 2004 demo more like an alternate take.<br /><br />13. Silver Springs (early take), A, lovely early take by Stevie.  already, it's a powerhouse here.  2004 disc has a later alternate version.<br /><br />14. Planets of the Universe (demo), B+, nice demo of an ok Stevie song not finished until her 2001 solo cd.  i like the demo better than the finished song.  it sounds like Rhiannon.  another take is on the 2004 cd.<br /><br />15. Dosen't Anything Last (acoustic duet), B, a short 1 minute demo of a Lindsey song with Stevie.  2004 cd has the solo demo with just Lindsey.<br /><br />16. Never Going Back Again (instrumental), A.  this beautiful song always sounds great as an instrumental song.  here it has the drum brushes.  ironically on the 2004 cd, the track is called Brushes but it has no Brushes, but is a more polished demo.<br /><br />so now we have 3 versions of Rumours:  1990 single cd, 2004 2-cd remaster & this 2013 3-cd remaster.  if u are just an average fan & already have the 2004 set there's no need to get this for any upgrade of sound quality.  the avid fan should get this for the live set & the new set of demos.  a casual & non-audiophile fan can get the old single 1990 cd for dirt cheap.<br /><br />for me, i'm glad i got this (didn't want to pay $89. for the set, so i won't get to see the dvd).
B00006I53S|5.0|I bought this lens because of Canon's reputation and my prior experience with their products.  I'll say right off that I am not disappointed.  Actually, I'm quite fond of it and it has become my primary 'walking around' lens.  As pointed out by numerous other reviewers the lens is quite capable of producing excellent images, especially stopped down a bit, has very good color fidelity, and sports super fast focusing with little of the 'hunting' that bedevils too many other AF lenses. The IS is a great feature too.  I'm generally not a big fan of zoom lenses (all my other lenses are of the fixed focal length variety) because of extra weight, mechanical complexity, and often compromised imaging capabilities.  However, this lens won me over because it doesn't cost a king's ransom (the \\"L\\" lenses come to mind) and is surprisingly light and small given its wide focal length range and decent low-light capabilities.<br /><br />But here's the puzzle.  As also mentioned by many reviewers, the lens suffers from \\"lens creep\\" where, when it is pointed downward and gravity has a chance to work, the lens will extend to its maximum 135mm focal length.  This will happen even faster, and with greater surety, when the weight of a glass filter and/or lens hood is added to the mix.  The practical result of this is that the lens, being fully extended, is more open to damage from accidental impact, and if you don't happen to be shooting at 135mm then you will have to re-zoom the lens every time you bring the camera to your eye.  This characteristic isn't a deal breaker for me, but it is odd that Canon hasn't come up with a simple fix.<br /><br />Regardless, I've become accustomed to the lens creep, and find the positive features and overall quality of the lens, especially considering the low price, more than enough compensation.<br /><br />Yes, I would heartily recommend this lens to a friend, albeit with a bit of a disclaimer first.
B00B19DMUE|2.0|The Possession is a film that's so formulaic that after 20 minutes you can predict not only what happens but who is going to die and in what order. The one good thing is that the child actors run rings around the adults in the film - other than that, you can literally set your watch to the events as they unfold in the film.<br /><br />The plot has something to do with a kid buying a box at a garage sale that comes with a hidden demon. Possession follows. There's the compulsory Internet Research Scene (IRS) to explain everything to the audience. There are rabbis who then fill in the gaps if you missed any part of the exposition. SPOILER ALERT: And then like every possession film ever made, it ends with a Very Religious Character (VRC) screaming at the demon to leave the possessed and for some reason the demon does. If anyone can write a possession film that doesn't rely on an IRS or VRC, I will personally buy you a beer.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Not the best thing I have read but it's up there. Great book, looking forward to see how the series progresses.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|It's a very nice book with lots of details but there is some violence and lots of big words which are harder to comprehend for younger readers so they may not understand the book. I actually loved the book. It was sad at the end but I thought it was nice that you got to see the dog`s point of view.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A well told story about devotion to loved ones amidst times of conflicting values with authority. A very entertaining read.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This is an honest and beautifully written novel.  The dilemma at its core involves death, yet somehow Ms. Forman has managed - through the appeal and strength of her heroine - to give the story a positive, if gritty, spin.  I loved it!<br />-Judith Avila, co-author of &#34;Code Talker: The First and Only Memoir by one of the Original Navajo Code Talkers of WWII&#34;
1609611543|4.0|I read this book and fund it very interesting.  I am not allergic to wheat, dairy and chocolate, so I had already given up wheat.  I am not overweight and didn't notice any significant changes.  My friend took the advice and said for the  first time in years, her stomach was completely flat.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is a must-see series for everyone. Rather than treat Adams as an icon, the viewer sees Adams, his wife and family in everyday life: their home in town, the farm, in their European venues. The viewer glimpses what life was like in the Colonial era and what the Founding Fathers actually risked. Makes the viewer wonder if such people exist in this country today. It is an eye-opener for those who think history is boring.

B0076DELIG|5.0|It's a bit difficult to review Harry Bosch books for the simple reason that it's almost impossible to believe that any mystery fan isn't going to read them all. It really doesn't matter what the story line is, whether this one is better or worse than another, or anything else. These books set the bar pretty high. Connelly is one of a handful of writers in this genre that you read, period. The readers biggest challenge is to find books that approach the quality of these because there aren't enough of them to occupy all of our time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its a fun game to play highly recommended I play it in my spare time good way to pass time
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Over the years I've gotten used to the exciting escapades of Kay Scarpetta, Benton, Marino, Lucy, and the whole cast of regular characters. Over the last several books, however, there has been an underlying theme or our heroine being under attack from persons unknown. It was cool the first time but is now getting a bit boring. The story was formulaic and when the &#34;bad guy&#34; was finally revealed he was so inconsequential to the story line that I didn't remember him at all. Still, a Cornwell book is always welcome and more entertaining than most. This is just not her best work.

Watching the movie reminded me of \\"It Takes a Thief\\" but on steroids. The cat and mouse game between Brosnan, Russo, and the police is superb. The multiple twists at the climatic scene is exceptional.

B004Z2TUGE|2.0|The only part of this movie I liked was the dog. If you want to watch a good show with teens, watch  Buffy. Buffy is way better. Better acting, much better script, lots of humor and suspense. This movie could have used a little humor, and I got tired of Sarah. I wanted Number Four to get up with Number Six, and Sam to get up with Sarah.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it is too easy to use. like like like like like like like it for my needings and fast, thanks.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game all my friends play but you should put something in so you can come back right where you left off.thanks for listening
B007BT0RKG|5.0|This app is a lifesaver! It enables you to download full detailed roadmaps to your device and have them on hand without the need for data usage or wifi signal. Excellent for wifi only devices or if you dont want to use excessive data consumption while travelling. I downloaded the three states closest to my home and no longer have to carry a big bulky paper atlas in the car. The maps are bright crisp well detailed and easy to read. The zoom function works better than web based map applications because there is no lag from waiting for the map to load. Super handy when navigating congested cities, you can zoom in to see all the easy to miss side streets in full detail. There is no route planning feature in the free version but it is available for a small fee in the pay version. Well worth every penny!

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely love this novel. There's a mixture of drama, romance, and occasional comedy. I felt like all of the char characters were well-developed and/or at least likable. The The actual characterization itself is also strong, with almost each person talking or acting in a different way than the others. I wish the vocabulary had been a little less simple, but in some cases, it was also realistic that way, because of a teenager telling the story. There are also a number of good quotes. This page-turner is a must-read.

B00B7G3NFU|5.0|A beautiful film telling a difficult story with such sensitivity and humor by a stellar cast. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it highly.
0385536828|3.0|While reading this, I kept thinking about politics and literature and how sometimes these two subjects nurture and propel each other forward and how sometimes they are at odds with each other and destroy each other. Unfortunately the big ideas of the book don't really come together in a pleasing narrative. Instead, I finished with an \\"oh well, that's that.\\"<br /><br />Still he's a fascinating author and watching him play with these ideas is interesting if not entirely rewarding.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I'm 67  years old and I play this game for too long! The game is a visual  challenge for me and a fun game for me to play with the grandkids who INSIST on using up the coins I'm saving foe.  Whatever!  Just too addictive

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not put this book down! I'm rarely surprised by big reveals in a book, and although the reveal crossed my mind, it wasn't until right before it actually happened. The characters were well written. I loved the thought processes of the characters during unimaginable circumstances. Best book I've read in a while.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey season 3 is everything that I hope it would be. Watching the first two seasons you fall in love with the characters. They do such a good job, that you can hate them too. There are twist and turn that you don't see coming and you want to know where it's going to take you.
0425252868|5.0|More the story of German ace Franz Stigler than American B-17 pilot Charlie Brown. Fascinating look at Franz's wartime experience. He didn't favor the Nazis, The Party, but his duty was to the Luftwaffe and Germany. The early German pilots believed in a code of honor; they sought to destroy machines, not kill men.<br /><br />When Franz came upon the horribly damaged B-17 slowly striving to get out of German airspace and back to England, he couldn't believe the tattered plane could stay in the air. He could see the dead tail gunner with the blood icicles on his guns. He saw the crewmen through the holes in the fuselage, tending each other's wounds. He saw the shock and fear in the pilots' eyes. It would be an easy kill, but not one he could have on his conscience for the rest of his life. Instead, he escorted them over the Atlantic Wall fortifications, keeping his countrymen from shooting them down.<br /><br />Germans and Nazis were not synonymous. A Higher Call celebrates the life of one of the honorable Germans caught up in a disastrous war not of his choosing.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Such an amazing book. Making the narrator the young boy starts out a bit twee, but quickly proves to be a masterful choice. I almost wish I'd known nothing about the book prior to reading it because of the mystery of discovering Jack and Ma's situation. Highly recommended this book.

B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|WOW WOW WOW.  This album is FANTASTIC!<br /><br />I've heard tracks from Tegan and Sara through the years and none really ever resonated with me. Then in the last few months, I started hearing remixes around of this amazing track called \\"Closer.\\"<br />I Shazam and discover its Tegan and Sara.  What a surprise! I don't remember them being this accessible before.<br /><br />Based on some blogs and noticing that Greg Kurstin helped work on this project, I got the full album.  Greg Kurstin did some of my favorite tracks on Kylie Minogue's X album and has produced some hot jams through the years from the likes of P!nk, Little Boots, Britney Spears, Kesha and such and I'm really looking forward to his work on the new Dido album coming out.<br /><br />Anyway, so glad I got this album.  I literally cant stop listening it.  Its been on repeat for several days and my top 3 fave tracks so far are, in order:<br /><br />Shock to the System<br />Now I'm All Messed Up<br />Closer<br /><br />The entire album is heart-warming, honest, beautifully song with really anthemic lyrics and fresh music to back it up.  5 stars and for now is my album of the year.  This looks to be a promising 2013 in music!

B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Maggie Smith stars as Jean Horton, an aging opera diva waiting for a new hip (again! same premise as Best Exotic Marigold Hotel) who has run out of money to pay for her incredibly gorgeous London flat and so has to move to Beecham House, opulent retirement home for aged musicians. She arrives to a standing ovation, to find that her ex-husband, a few old friends and one rival diva rank amongst the inhabitants of  the home.<br />Tom Courtenay is Reginald Paget, Jean's ex and is particularly wonderful and moving I thought. Billy Connolly is randy old Wilf Bond, there for comic effect (brilliant move Dustin) and Pauline Collins is perfect as the adorable but slightly demented Cissy Robson.<br />Don't believe some of the cynical reviews out there. This one is a keeper and will be purchased by me to pull out regularly when I need a little lift. It is not a realistic film (if you have spent any time around a real retirement/nursing home you will know what I mean) but it is not meant to be. It is meant to be an uplifting, inspirational film about how to age gracefully, supported by good friends and continuing to pursue your passions. Kind of like hanging around with the coolest grandparents in England!

B008220C38|4.0|I saw Anna Karenina this week with a group of girlfriends. Not having the time to go out afterward for our usual \\"gab about the film over coffee\\", I have been mulling it over alone for a few days now.  What did I think of the film? Hmmmm. I find it difficult to answer.<br />First of all, if you enjoy period drama you should definitely see this film. I can even say that I will purchase this on DVD to have in my collection. But I have to say that I want to see it again more for the spectacle and the costumes and the ingenious set design than for the story.<br />I will qualify this by saying that I have not read the book Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy, touted as one of the best novels of all time. I do however, really want to read the novel now. And I want to see the film again after I have read the book and see if I feel differently about it. That is a recommendation for the film right there isn't it?<br />The acting is superb. Keira Knightley does an amazing job as Anna Karenina. She is luminous onscreen and her descent into inevitable madness is riveting. Matthew McFadyen is wonderful as Anna's brother. Very odd to see he and Keira Knightley dancing together as brother and sister, having the image of Lizzy and Darcy from Pride and Prejudice 2005 stuck firmly in my head, but he is wonderful as the philandering brother. Jude Law is appropriately cold and detached as Anna's husband Karenin. But I don't think you will be emotionally attached to these characters because there isn't time for character development, even though it clocks in at just over 2 hours long.<br />But I really did like it. The music was lovely, the costumes were to die for. Oh, the hats and the veils alone are worth the price of admission. And I think that Joe Wright can now be viewed as a singularly talented director. This was a real risk and he pulled it off admirably.<br />I think my only quibble is the same one I would level at Joe Wright's Pride and Prejudice. These books are just too long to be squeezed into 2 hours. If he could have been given the length of a miniseries to do this, it might have involved me more in the story, as one who knew little of the plot ahead of time. But in the time allotted, this is a truly wonderful film. And if it gets a lot of us to read the book, what more can we ask?<br /><br />P.S. Try not to be too distracted by the familiar actors from other beloved films. Points to anyone who can spot William the ill fated footman from Downton Abbey in this. Much easier to spot Lady Mary (and Moaning Myrtle and Jane Eyre and Mary Maceachran and Elsie the housemaid and Jane Fairfax and...)squeezed into 2 hours.

0312611692|5.0|The author reviews the progress of socio-economic accomplishments in the Eastern and Western worlds so as to determine which of the two is likely to lead the world in the future.  After considering their history during the past 14,000 years he concludes that modern technology has more or less equalized the two and any difference between them will be irrelevant.  Neither will lead and - as is touchingly illustrated in a poem by Rudyard Kipling - Eastern and Western social developments will likely join in a fraternal union.  Alas, while this should complete the proclaimed task of the book, there is a big addendum:  To wit, this investigation has also revealed the unexpected predicament that the same technology, which has brought us such marvelous success, has at the same time landed us at the edge of an abyss. The reader hears about nuclear devastation and similar disasters (called \\"Nightfall\\") or, in the alternative, about \\"Singularity\\", an eerie specter that sounds even worse.  The race between the two may end as early as 2045 and you get the impression, either way that would be the end of human civilization the way we know it.<br /><br />Certainly, if you take the addendum seriously, it would deprive the first 95% of the book of any significance whatsoever.  Death is knocking on the door, so what is the purpose of questioning 14,000 years of history to find the future leader?  It would perhaps have been better, had Ian Morris curtailed his scientific predictions a trifle, but whatever your opinion might be, I beg you not to overlook the sheer pleasure of accompanying him on this travel through the centuries and millennia of humanity's growth toward modernity.  He will guide you through many cultures at both extremities of the Eurasian continent and you will be impressed by his familiarity with all of them.  You observe that beauty, wisdom and goodness are all human and can be found around the world, but regrettably so are outrageous brutality and mass murder.  What an intrepid job it was to weigh two distant cultures one against the other over the course of thousands of years.  The author has selected four quantifiable traits by which to roughly measure human progress even millennia ago so as to be able to estimate the changing ups and downs of their progress.  The effort to execute such rating system in a realm as chaotic, forever changing and helter-skelter as \\"social development\\" and do it in a plausible way seems almost insurmountable.  Never mind that some reviewers disagree on one point or another, for this is too complex a subject to expect uniform answers.  For those interested in the origin and evolution of the human race and their modern interpretation, reading this book should instead be one of sheer delight and a genuine intellectual feast.<br /><br />There is one final thought.  Our present global uncertainties resemble that of 100 years ago:  Had a European Union existed in the early 20th century, there would have been no world wars, no atomic bomb and no Holocaust.  Unification eliminates wars, cools nerves and promotes pragmatism.  This book points at all the justifications for us to unite under global law and to build a defensive unit to tackle oncoming global challenges.  Global federation has been a dream for centuries and has been exhaustively investigated for decades.  Its basic outlines are well known and it is a feasible undertaking.  The time is right. The history of human civilization is impatiently waiting for us to do what must be done.  Yet, this book touches on it only in passing and almost dismissively and is joined by many other recent publications that don't mention it at all.  Global federation is simply on nobody's agenda.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|The writers did a great job giving the original stories a modern spin. Great job to the actors too. The entire cast is awesome.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  It kept my attention the entire time and i loaned it to a friend who had the same thoughts.  I highly recommend this book (assuming you can handle the f-bomb several times a page).
B004JN1CW4|3.0|Of the three books, I consider this one to be the weak link. It has good rhythm but lacks argument and there are a few things you still have doubts about. It was a fun read, though.
0452295548|5.0|This book can be a slow start for those who don't wish to read the scientific introductory pages. But, as the author advises, come back and read it later. Just don't stop there. This book is a book about hope for anyone who has had, will have or is caring for someone who has had a stroke. Most importantly, it is about accepting your own unique self as valuable...no matter what state your body is in at any given moment. My daughter has inoperable cancer, so the stories are different and will end differently, but this is a book I return to for light when it gets very dark.
B000006IUQ|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE WITH LOTS OF SUSPENCE. MY MOM MADE THE WHOLE FAMILY WATCH IT BECAUSE SHE LOVED IT SO MUCH
B008B92U32|3.0|I don't know what age(s) this is meant for, but I (an adult) thought it would be funny to do a few of these and send them to friends/family, but they come out horrible (or maybe you have to be really really talented to do this correctly), either way, I was done with it after a few minutes, but my niece (5 years old) can't get enough of it.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|The sets where great and acting very good. Watching the film in 2013 is just as entertaining as it was at time of release. Only now it is retro. The story line is also good.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|surprisingly entertaining and involving for an adult watching this with their young teen. Characters were believable and story line felt real.
B0092G1O8A|5.0|Great entertainment. I liked the movie better than the book. The characters were perfectly cast. Once again, we see how the concentration of power in a central government leads to tyrrany.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Seems pretty accurate.  I like the 15 day look ahead.  And I like the weather advisory reports.  I usually use intellacast, but there is no app for that, so this works well.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|After numerous recommendations to read this book, I finally went into it with VERY high expectations (Not a good thing to do).. After the first 2 chapters were done, I was left captivated and needing each new word in this book more than I needed to eat. Not only were my high expectations met,but this book took those high expectations, grabbed them, screamed \\"You only though I was this good? How dare you disrespect me\\", then threw them away, all while it continued to dish out the finest book I have ever had the pleasure of reading.<br /><br />I spent 45min trying to physically insert myself into the book with hopes I could enter this magical world.. There was a point at minutes 23-27 where I'm convinced my left foot entered and it was the finest 4 minutes of my life.<br /><br />I am now on the process of creating my own oasis and you will be happy to know that I am almost near completion. While I don't want to give everything away, I promise you that this experience will be better than riding a 7 year old unicorn through a field of poppies while eating bacon and rubbing your nipples. You can expect this world changing device to be available at WalMart within the year.<br /><br />Oh ya, back to the book..... I would have to say that this book is the finest piece of literature.... No no, this book is the finest ANYTHING to graze this beautiful earth.<br /><br />Incase you are wondering, I recommend it.
B0055QYKQO|4.0|This is a very good motherboard. I bought it to use the FX-8350. I had no problems at all overclocking the CPU. Only rated it a 4 star because when plugging in my SATA cables the connection seems kind of loose as the cables wiggle around a little.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have already finished viewing all of season 3. It is the happiest and saddest of the three seasons. (I hope that Dan Stevens will forever be haunted by the knowledge that he broke the hearts of millions of fans).<br /><br />In the past, there were scenes in the Dvd's that were not shown on the television version. That does not appear to be the case this time. All the episodes are one hour instead of an hour and a half; nevertheless, all were great. I'm glad that I pre-ordered.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Woww, what can I say about this book? If you love - like I do- a good legal drama, this is a must read!!<br />It's such a page-turner ! i could put it down, yet I didnt want it to end. The charachter are so well written, you can actually feel their pain and angst. This isnt just another court drama about guilty or not guilty, not at all. This is also a heart-breaking family drama that keeps you gussing what would you do if something like this ever happens to your family.<br /> Must confess that may thoughts about Jacob's culpability keep on changing all throughout the book. The author manages to keep you hooked and guessing pretty much 'til the last pages. And the ending, wooow the ending was sooo. . . I mean, I didnt see it coming!! Was totally unpredictable, yet very realistic!! Cant wait for the movie to come out!! :D

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I needed an additional cable, as I keep one by the bed, in case I am reading and my battery is low, I can plug the kindle in and keep reading, and I have one that I keep attached to my computer, as I do not have wireless capability. Very pleased with both the product and the price.
0307474712|4.0|Great book! Starts off a little slow, but then you find that you can't put this book Down. There is even a movie!
B006LSZECO|4.0|interestingly written, many endings keep going thru your  mind as you readit.  The final ending was definitely the last I would have thought. In retrospect it fit.
B000002ADT|5.0|In my opinion, \\"Kind of Blue\\" is the definitive jazz album of all time. If you were stuck on an island with just one CD to your name, this would have to be the one. The tracks on this album will never get old. They are as relevant and accessible today as they were when this album was first cut. Miles can take a listener in a lot of directions, but all points begin with \\"Kind of Blue.\\"

0670022411|5.0|Love this book! Orginally read it on my nook but they took it away before I could finish it and the waiting list was too long so I purchased the book. Loved it, couldn't put it down! Not your typical witch book!

B001NEK2GE|5.0|Use it for WoW and it's great. I recently switched from a &#34;Clicker and Keyboard Turner&#34; to a real player. This is awesome for a lot of reasons but mostly for the joystick. Moving that way frees up several awesome location keys for keybinds. Ergonomics are great. (Warning: it will take you a little while to become 100% comfortable moving this way if you're used to moving with a keyboard....but worth the change)<br /><br />Haven't even started getting into the macros yet.<br /><br />Screen is nice but I don't use it much at all.

B003I55BIA|1.0|Perfect chemistry is a book that is among the many many trends of bad boy reforms for good girl.<br />Let me just say, it's incredibly unrealistic and stereotypical. For starters, it gives the impression that all latinos have to be gang members or unable to finish high school . Her use of spanglish throughout the book is not even used correctly which is more than proof that she didn't even bother to really investigate a lot of the words properly. A lot of the people are just stilted stereotypes out of some gang movie.<br />Secondly, gang member life is not at all the way it is depicted here. If he really was in a gang he would not look like an abercombie model. He would be so covered by tattoos that you wouldn't see his face. He would have to worry about a lot more things than knife fights, and it would be much more serious consequences from leaving a gang. If you are going to write about gangs, do it responsibly.<br />I will say I liked the characters , but was really insulted about being slammed in the face that he is mexican the whole time. Hello, he is capable of not speaking spanglish the whole time just to prove a point. If the guy was irish would he be saying dumb irish slang the whole time to get into character?<br />Please.

1451627297|3.0|I'm a sucker for Stephen King. When he is good, he is very, very good. He can tap into universal fears and convince readers that they are right to fear clowns, houses that appear \\"wrong\\" somehow, malevolent cats and dogs, and even inanimate machines (like cars) that seem to bear grudges. He can develop characters who come alive better than any living author I have read. He believes in an absolute evil that all must confront, both in themselves and outside themselves. When he is bad, he is not horrid, just hokey and formulaic. This novel leans toward the good side, but it is not among his very best.<br /><br />The subject here is not things that go bump in the night, but time travel. Jake Epping is a 35-year-old, recently-divorced English teacher. When his friend Al shows him a portal to a past time, 1958, he decides to give it a try, mainly to see if he can save a particular family, that of a GED student who has written an essay about the slaying of his mother and siblings.<br /><br />The hitch with this time travel is that when the traveler returns to his present and then goes through the portal again, back to 1958, time starts over, so that anything previously changed has reverted. When Al persuades Jake to go back in time to try to save President Kennedy from being killed by Lee Harvey Oswald, Jake first has to go back to re-save the student's family, before traveling to Texas to wait for 1963.<br /><br />The remainder of the book concerns Jake's time in a small town in Texas, where he falls in love; and his shadowing of Oswald, to be sure that he alone was responsible for Kennedy's death. And, then of course, the race to stop the assassination.<br /><br />This, then, is not so much an alternate history as it is an account of how Jake changes history. The conclusion is a bit surprising, and somewhat anticlimactic.<br /><br />Good Things: The story is absorbing and mostly well paced. The portrayal of Oswald and his wife Marina is convincing. The plot is logical, once the basic suspension of disbelief about time travel has been overcome.<br /><br />Bad Things: The level of character development is limited to only a few of the participants, thus failing to create total involvement. The novel is too long (831 pages)and should have been trimmed somewhat of details, particularly of the mechanics of the shadowing of Oswald. The love story seems very thin and tacked on.<br /><br />The Main Bad Thing for me, though, would not be noted by a non-Texan. King got the geography and culture of Texas wrong! With his (obviously extensive) research about Oswald and Dallas, he should have included a look at the map of Texas. Three times he mentions the odor of oil and natural gas in Dallas, which supposedly comes from the Permian Basin and Midland/Odessa. That's 300+ miles. Really? His fictional small Texas town is near Killeen, which is characterized as being in South Central Texas. Actually, Killeen is located in North Central Texas. A band of amateur teenage musicians from San Antonio comes to play at a party in this town. That's 100+ miles for an amateur band. Really? At the same party, with students in attendance, the high school faculty members are getting loaded on beer. Did King not know about the Bible Belt? This would never happen. Businessmen in Dallas are portrayed as openly wearing holsters and handguns to work. Open-carry has been prohibited in Texas since Reconstruction. The anti-litter campaign \\"Don't Mess With Texas\\" is mentioned. This slogan was not created until the '80s. I know this is picky, but if you have the money and resources of Stephen King, you should hire the people to do the research, even if you don't want to bother yourself.<br /><br />I would give this novel a B in comparison with the best of King's works. It is still a late-into-the-night, absorbing read.

1400069289|5.0|Great read, went through this book pretty fast. I enjoy non fiction/self help books and this is one of my favorites.
B00969GFFU|3.0|Franzen is widely credited with bringing realistic fiction back into vogue--straight forward story telling with no fanciful post-modern flourishes. He writes about families, with all their misunderstandings, hurts, secrets, and unresolved psychological problems. Evidently this resonates with many readers. I feel like saying to his characters, \\"Just GET OVER YOURSELF!\\"<br /><br />This is the story of the Berglunds: Walter and Patty, an environmental lawyer and his seemingly perfect stay-at-home wife; and their children Jessica, a serious over-achiever, and Joey, a charming manipulator. Other major players include Walter's best friend Richard, a feckless musician who incites in Patty a long-lived fascination and lust, and Connie, Joey's girl friend who immolates her entire self in order to bind him. Everything goes downhill fast, as the father finds himself involved in a seemingly environmentally friendly cause, only to find out that it is greed-based exploitation, and the mother yields to her long-repressed sexual impulses. This is all played out in the George W. Bush years, with much of the action centered around the \\"moral corruption\\" of the people and the time.<br /><br />So this is a family drama about people who screw up royally (literally and figuratively) mainly because they had really bad parenting. (Actually, all the parents had been fairly well-intentioned and nobody was tortured or deprived, but anyway.) All the characters are smart and analyze their feelings obsessively, but they still behave badly. What is missing here are real family love, some sort of moral code, less self-involvement. This may be a picture of a typical modern upper-middle-class American family in the 21st century, but it is not a family that I have ever known.<br /><br />Franzen tells a good story and keeps the reader's interest, even if the reader (me) is terribly frustrated with the selfishness of the characters. He inserts much reference to War and Peace, seemingly hoping to copy its template of family drama against the larger backdrop of historical events. He also rather obviously highlights many of his own pet opinions about environmental concerns and liberalism versus conservatism in America. Not that I am not in agreement with him much of the time, but his preaching did somewhat obtrude.<br /><br />This novel is an interesting read, but I don't agree with many critics that it was at all a great novel. It is too long, includes too much preaching, includes story lines left unfinished and others too needlessly explored, has implausible plot elements, and, finally, has no really sympathetic characters. I'm glad I read it, but I won't read it again.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It's always interesting to hear stories from those who were there.  This was such a monumental mission for US history...thanks for sharing the details.

0307352145|5.0|As a tech geek with strong introverted tendencies, this book was informative and empowering.  The insight into societal changes and its view of introverts vs extroverts was very good, and the physiological studies detailed were very educational (and definitely new to me).  It has become a &#34;book of the month&#34; for a bunch of us at work.  Recommended for all introverts and extroverts and everyone in between.

B0009XRZ9M|4.0|Me and my family watch this movie every Christmas. This has been a tradition we do every year. This movie is great for all ages.
0345535421|2.0|When I read the first of this series, A Game of Thrones, I said to myself that I might read the second, but if it was the same-old I would not read the rest. So this is the second. I will not read the rest. This was not even as good as the first one.<br /><br />In the first of the series, the king is killed and the kingdom is thrown into chaos. In this one, six different claimants for the throne scheme and make war with each other, culminating in a grand battle which leaves only three claimants. In the meantime, dragons have hatched, which allows magic to creep back into the land.<br /><br />This book has the problems of the first, multiplied. It is even longer-winded (969 pages). It is padded with detailed descriptions of appearance and wearing apparel, even in climactic scenes. (Every time Queen Cersei shows up, her \\"yellow\\" hair is described as \\"tumbling to her bare shoulders in thick curls.\\" I'm picturing Farrah Fawcett here.) It includes the menu of almost every meal. (While the final battle is going on, the women dine on broth; a salad of apples, nuts, and raisins; crabclaw pies; mutton roasted with leeks and carrots, served in trenchers of hollowed bread; and goatcheese served with baked apples flavored with cinnamon. Yumm!) It throws in a graphic gratuitous sex scene from time to time, plus multiple mentions of rape. (We are, however, spared detailed descriptions of the rapes.) One improvement--most of the grammatical problems present in the first have been cleaned up.<br /><br />Again, Martin uses the soap-opera style of narration: short scenes, one after another, from the viewpoints of eleven different characters. Thus the book starts with a 7-page scene in the life of 10-year-old Arya, followed by a 15-page scene about 13-year-old Sansa, a 17-page scene about the dwarf Tyrion, and an 11-page scene about 8-year-old Bran, before returning to continue Arya's story. OK, I get it that this lets the reader know that all the action is happening simultaneously, but it totally destroys any semblance of dramatic pacing.<br /><br />And what's up with all these children who act like adults? Three of the claimants to the throne are under 16, and one of them is leading an army. The 10-year-old slits a guard's throat. Really?<br /><br />To be totally fair, the basic plot is somewhat suspenseful, even as chopped up as it is. The dwarf Tyrion is an interesting character, even though he is the only one. I would consider this book to be third or fourth tier fantasy, behind such authors as Tolkien, Frank Herbert, and even Robert Jordan.<br /><br />Of course, Martin leaves all manner of enticing loose ends to encourage readers to buy the next book. I plan to save my money and read a plot synopsis on the internet.

B007W1BLN0|4.0|This true story keeps one just at the edge of another &#34;mental health&#34; movie in which the main character needs that kind of &#34;help&#34;.  Remarkable for it's honesty and for the cooperation of the young man's own family since the story took place.
0425252868|5.0|I could not put the book down.Tom Brokaw says these people are the Greatest Generation. It would seem that this applies to both sides in this war. All of these young men were really fighting for each other regardless of what side they were on. Both sides committed atrocities and both side carried out some honorable deeds.I found this book to be heart warming.

0061537969|5.0|I am not even a dog person and I LOVED this book. I picked it up not really knowing exactly what the story was about, just knew it was becoming quite popular. I was blown away, mostly because of how closely I related the story to my own life. I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did but being told from the dog's perspective made it that much more touching and heartwarming I also loved Enzo's personality!
0316228532|5.0|First some background. The first 3 Harry Potter books came out when I was in elementary school, so I got to grow up with Harry Potter. Now I am 22 and in college. Because I loved the Harry Potter series I decided to check out Rowlings new \\"adult\\" novel. I absolutely love it. Rowling's writing skill is unparalleled. I could picture and feel every scene in the book. I also never felt so many emotions while reading a book. You get to know each character down to their core.<br /><br />I won't get into the plot, you have to experience it for yourself.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|I purchased the digital copy for my daughter (age 7) after she saw the commercial for the DVD and just couldn't wait for it. She watched it twice in 24 hours, even though she has to watch it on the computer.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Everything from lighting through acting is far superior to what we have to offer series-wise. Hollywood:WAKE UP!<br />Not only is the setting visually stunning, as are the costumes; the acting is stellar. You are transported to a different time and place as the acting is invisible--these people ARE their characters. The writers really researched the period; you feel like you are there. I hope this show lasts a long time.

B004LWZWGK|3.0|Ok, it's better than most movies made, but if Rises is a 5 and Begins is a 4, than this is a 3.<br />Some good reviews out there about all the odd things about the movie, so I'll just mention one thing that probably bothered me the most.  After 8 years, Bruce is hobbling around with a cane like he's an old man who just got beat up last week?  Sure he may have sustained injuries that a normal guy would be like this without seeking treatment....but he's a billionaire.  And in this batman world of super gadgets, we're supposed to believe he hasn't gotten the best doctors in the world to either fix him or use artificial means to make himself more of a \\"bionic\\" batman?  By now he should have been back on the streets for years showing up every once in a while during the late hours to pummel some bad guy just so they know he's still around.

B004TPJMLA|4.0|This album doesn't necessarily knock your socks off the first time you hear it, but the rhythms, driven by the South American durms throughout the album, have a way of getting stuck in your ear. I mean that in a good way. It took several listening sessions over a few weeks realize that I was really, really enjoying it every time I heard it. The songs don't have quite the catchy hooks of some of Simon's classics, but they create a mood and a world that will suck you in and make you feel glad you're there.

B003VANOFY|3.0|Other than some occasional random reconnects where the headset decides my settings are wrong and need to be reset the headset is perfect.    It clamps to my head so tight that it cancels out sound in the surrounding area PERFECTLY. Cannot even hear myself talk correctly, it's like I have my fingers in my ears. This tiny drawback is counteracted by a setting in the software controls called \\"sidetone\\" where the mic feeds back your voice in real-time so you can hear yourself talk.    Really other than the weird reconnects that can happen several times in an hour or sometimes not for days the headset is wonderful, I love it.    Battery life of about 8 hours too.    EDIT: Buzzing problem that can show up a few times a day or not for weeks. I can make it stop but its scaring the s*** out of me. Seems like a hardware issue, would not recommend buying this headset.
B000002LQR|5.0|Damn-near perfect. Though, obviously not for children. At any rate, there very few contemporary artist can that touch on basic human rights and the struggle of relationships in the same work.

B009ERK1T0|4.0|One can ride around listening to it for quite some time. Though, not much for a playlist based hard-hitting music (regarding the struggle) and instrumentals.

B005C9YZIW|5.0|I think blue ray DISC is made only for this distinctive work of Art.<br />I love most of BBC documentaries and on top of their professionalism, the quality of sound and picture second to none....!!!<br />Wow, I come to respect the life and its surroundings so much I tend to watch it over and over again...  With the family...!!<br />Informative and helpful, awareness of surroundings...!!!<br /><br />Thank you.!
B004IZMQI2|5.0|I am not sure if I am supposed to rate the book or the quality of the download purchase from Amazon.  The book is good and the download was flawless.
B00683JK9K|5.0|I wouldn't pay for it but this is a decent puzzle app. Regarding some of the problems others experienced: you do have to double-tap to rotate the pieces, and it does seem that if your piece is not rotated correctly and you drag it to the edge of the screen, it will &quot;disappear&quot; (go back to the puzzle pieces on the right side of the screen.)<br /><br />You can always turn off the rotate feature if those things are bothering you.<br /><br />I like it. Nice graphics, different levels of difficulty. Nice.
B006OFN0SE|5.0|\\"J. Edgar\\" humanizes a man I can't stand.  After learning about this movie I was eager to see how Hollywood handled the homosexual rumors about Hoover.  The acting is good and the story believable. I learned about the tragic Lindbergh kidnapping and murder.  People were crazy long before Sandy Hook!
B008NW67E0|5.0|I bought this CD for my  Fiancé for Christmas.  He absolutely loves it!  Came packaged great.  If you liked their previous CDs, you will for sure like this one just as much, if not more.
B002ZG980U|5.0|This movie is really great!  Makes you think a lot.  I've watched it a few times and each time I learn something new.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This case is AMAZING!!!! I take it in the water with my son all of the time!!!!! The pictures come out amazing!!!!! This is my 2nd life proof case only because I wanted a different color!!!! The only downfall is that it does not have a place for a wrist band for when I'm in the water and not using it!!!!! But I would recommend this for everyone with kids, people who love to take Picts in water, and anyone who wants their phone protected!!!!!
B001GA1RFA|4.0|I'm a die hard John Green fan, so he could pretty much write anything and I would love it. The Fault in our Stars is still my favorite, but this was a great book and it makes you excited for Summer!! I would reccommend this book to mostly teens and young adults.
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|every time it gets too boring they make someone die! I found the episodes of this season either boring or sad
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|I JUST LOVE ZOMBIE ACTION MOVIES!! THIS ONE DID THE JOB! SCARY WITH LOTS OF ACTION! BUT I LOVE ALL THE RESIDENT EVIL MOVIES!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it its a great game<br />I think that we should svnx<br />lstart as ponys<br />because my horse is 3 years old already
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  It's such a different world than the one we live in and Katniss is such a strong character.  I recommend this and the whole series.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Different story line than most.Keeps you on your toes. It will keep you guessing til the end. Looking forward to next Michael Connelly book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is exciting and fun!!!!! It has cool characters too<br />..... I love this game!!!! The game after a little time changes themes which I think is cool!!!!!! Have fun!!!! :D
B005LAIISU|2.0|My kids loved it. For me, Ice Age was good for the first movie and all of the rest have been increasingly boring.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Could not wait to finish it because you cannot know or begin to predict the ending. Keeps you guessing. I enjoyed it.
B0026EWZMY|5.0|This album is one of my favorite. Lands itself right below animals and right above wish you were here!<br /><br />It's psychedelic, I love every song.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I could not put this down. The great detail that went into this book to describe the way of life back in the 50's and the 60's was incredible! Mr. King makes you really feel like your there. What a great story, and I dare those that are not avid reader to try this book.....and I swear you will be a reader after this book!
B000001ZS3|5.0|I remember this music from my youth, when it was virtually experimental. Still great for background music when I write or to chill.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved it<br />It was hard to put down.<br />On e of the best books . I have read in a long time
0979019710|5.0|I have read many personal development books in the last 3 years, this was by far one of my favorites.  Hal did a great job of laying out a plan for us to follow; if you are at all interested in starting your day out with major focus and with a feeling that you can accomplish anything you put your mind to then I recommend you get, read, and apply these concepts in your life.  I have been actively engaged in My Miracle Morning for a month now and have met some goals that I have been trying to meet for 3 years.<br /><br />I am going to be giving a presentation to many women in the near future on reducing stress; I thought so much of this book I purchased several to hand out.  Paying it forward!!<br /><br />Kuddos to Hal Elrod
B000IDGBWU|5.0|Absolutely love this movie the dancing is great. It is one of my all time favorites. Love how Baby shows Johnny there are people who will stand up for you when necessary. How the reality is we are all human and make mistakes. I can watch this over and over.  It's up there with Fried Green Tomatoes. I never get tired of it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator! Just what I needed on my Kindle Fire!  A must have and this one does the job nicely and easily!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This was a gift to my son for Christmas, per his request.  We watched it 2 times in a few days!  Great feel good movie.  Son was very happy.
B005T87QCI|5.0|It is amazing. I think that you should have atom free though other than that it's amazing. I haven't stoped playing it
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Well, when playing the game I really enjoy it! But lately the game has been twitching to where I can't even play, because when I swipe to to move it won't and I end up dying :( i also think that you should have power ups for the coins, to make the value more like when you have the power ups with the coin magnet,to make it last longer. Overall I absolutely am addicted to this game......I love it!
B0094ZJ7HO|1.0|Mostly boring. Two good songs though. The Long War Shuffle and McGreggor are the only songs worth owning. I was bummed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm sad for it to be over but I loved the trilogy. Ready to see the movies when they come out!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Really good album. I saw the show at Vegas and wanted the album. If anyone happens to go to Vegas I recommend seeing the show.
B0053O89IS|5.0|If you have not watched Bones, then you are missing a great series.  I have all of them so far, and will continue to purchase the Complete Series as they come out.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Great visuals,great format. I use this at least twice a day and everyone who has seen it wants it. Breakdown of minutes left by category is super useful.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Any story with John Corey is fun and exciting.  John Corey character is so entertaining with his sarcasm and wit.  The only problem I had with it was that it dragged a bit to get to the climax of the story.  Otherwise, it introduced interesting characters.  Makes you wonder how much is truth and/or fiction in regards to how government agencies operate with international governments.
1591396190|4.0|Interesting book with some fresh insights.... always good to read a new perspective.  I like the belief that the competition should be treated as being irrelevent.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I know the method is working,because it's exactly what I've been doing for about fifteen - twenty years. I'm not doing it anymore, since I do judo twice a week, and it's very demanding. I do kettlebels for workout, because I need to train more explosive to avoid injuries, but if I wanted to bulk up again, I would be doing exactly the things described in this book. For the last couple of years I became a hobby personal trainer, I did the course, read about 50,or more books about nutrition,periodisation, cardio, strength-cardio, circuit, core-stability, stretching, etc., took up olimpic kettlebell training, but I never actualy trained anyone. - Not for money, anyway.<br />None of the books I read states heavy training like 4 to 6 reps as hypertrophy training, it's always considered as strength training, more of neuro-muscular developments, than building muscles. The resting period is more of ATP-CP system-like, than lactic acid, which would be about 1 - 2 minutes max.<br />However, since I wasn't aware these well-known facts, I trained actualy the same way as it described in this book for almost two decades, and I have to say, I grew like a mashroom. That's a fact too.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|It's Tinker Bell, what can I say.  Get the movie and watch it, you too will become a Tinker Bell fan.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good game defiantly needs to be more interactive and more to do so it not idle when u are waiting for energy
B009CZTDE8|5.0|I love this album, it relaxes, excites, motivates, whatever I need.  I hope they do more instumentals!  Highly recommend to others.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game is so awesome and fun, I feel like bragging to my friends about it. I like how much they improved the two games. It made the other game look like a piece of s***. I think everybody should have this cool game. I bet you that Temple Run 3 is going to be even more fun( if that's possible)
B00684J49U|5.0|In love with this series. Can't wait for season 9 to be released<br />Is there will be season 10 also?
B003DT19F0|5.0|Am a big lover of Disney movies, especially Tinker Bell,  Your only as old as you feel. and this disney character keeps me feeling young at heart.
B007H1HQW0|5.0|This is a great bottle cutter.<br /><br />The secret is to score the glass well (but only once!), pour a small stream of boiling water over the score, then quickly pour cold water on the score. This will stress the glass. Keep doing it until the two peices separate. If everything goes as it should, you'll have 2 perfect peices (barring any blemishes in the bottle itself, such as thick spots/thin spots) that you can even fit back together for a water tight seal (as long as you keep pressure on them).<br /><br />I've had about a 95% success rate with this cutter and method.<br /><br />Something to keep in mind - beer bottles are made out of more recycled glass, so the odds of getting a clean cut from one are MUCH slimmer.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|i really love this show however the seasons are becoming shorter on amazon orjust being reduced to make one season seem like two pretty sneaky dont you think otherwise great show just stick to 22 to 24 episodes per season yyou should fine with return viewership if not oops?
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|This movie was not at all what I expected. It was so much better. I loved it, and I'm glad it's a part of my collection now.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I purchased this so I could download waypoint data to my Garmin Etrex GPS. I no longer have a computer with an RS-232 port. I plugged this into my USB port and everything just worked with no hassles.
B000086EOE|5.0|Creatively and instrumentally, this album is great.  The only flaw, IMHO, is Mr. Hackett's singing, much of which is a kind of atonal spoken baritone (never to be confused with Peter Gabriel's voice).  I enjoyed the Wetton vocals more than some of the other reviewers.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This show has everything great characters, actors, story lines, comedy. This TV show is a joy watching every episode each week.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I really enjoy this film; it is one that I could (and do) watch over and over.  Action packed, but funny as well.
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|difficult to navigate and very frustrating, especially compared to the PC version. I definitely won't use it and may delete it from my Kindle.
0300169787|5.0|Lovely and rich book. There are a lot of informations and pictures of fashion shows and collections. McQuenn was a genius.
B009439HEY|5.0|I loved the first genesis revisited, was excited when I saw this was a double CD, was not disappointed.  More room to stretch out here, like the 23:35 Supper's Ready.  Also less singing by Mr. Hackett.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I love Michael Connelly's books and this was so good I read it twice, but I have read many of his twice!
B00845MRKE|5.0|I'm a collector of Blade Runner items  I have all the versions and cuts including the ones in this package  This is a quality group of versions enhanced by the Spinner model. Worth getting even if you aren't a rabid collector.  Nice packaging too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a nice game to have.lots of fun!! Easy to play but really addicting. If you love temple run this game is for you.
1476712042|5.0|Oh My God! I just fell in love with Travis & Abby's story! Abby's such a likable character, she's sweet, smart, and has a wild side (past) to her. And Travis is all the Alpha male fighter hotness that you would expect him to be. But when he meets Abby, his transformation towards and for her is incredible. Who would have thought, in the beginning of the book, that Travis would ever be so kind, caring, and would fall in love so hard for Abby when all she gave him was mixed signals and a standing offer for a friendship only. This is a book EVERYONE should get to read, at least once. I was so hooked with it that I kept on re-reading a couple of times!
B007L6VR12|5.0|A stellar cast, and two of the most adorably awkward, dorky, mis-fit 12 year olds ever destined to rule the world.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|The book was well written and I continued to read even though I really didn't want to read it.  I don't like to feel sad and I felt at first that I would stop.  I continued and accepted the message. I just like lighter subjects.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Excelente acompañante para aquellos que hayan adquirido la consola del play station 3 porque solo trae un control y no es muy divertido jugar con un solo mando.
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|I love unique board and card games so I was instantly interested in this game. The reviews about it being really hard worried me because I want to win, not constantly lose but I do like to be challenged so I took a risk and got it.<br /><br />I'm really enjoying this game! I won my first two games on normal difficulty. Then I tried hard and it was extremely difficult, so much so that I continually lost or had to resign. Fortunately, I watched the help videos again and kept playing to fully understand everything. I eventually had a couple of lucky games that weren't impossible and finally won but several games were so difficult I didn't have any hope to win them.<br /><br />Still, I'm very pleased with this game and recommend playing a few, then rewatching the help videos to pick up on things you miss the first time.<br /><br />Oh and the graphics are wonderful, plus this game has a great spooky/creepy atmosphere. -Rachel
0345803507|2.0|Can't get myself to finish reading this one. I started & got stuck on one part where she does something that she knows Christian will go crazy on her (to later be remorseful and saying I'm sorry & stuff). I just don't know, I guess I'll finish it someday but I think the story line could have ended on Fifty Shades Darker.
B0034G4P4O|1.0|The film opens very nicely, with a lovely tribute to Tintin's creator, Herge, depicted as a street artist who does a portrait of Tintin at the flea market where he picks up the first model of the Unicorn. It's all downhill from there.<br /><br />The plot loosely follows the \\"The Secret of the Unicorn\\" for a bit, but works its way into other stories from the series, and deteriorates further and further into a cliched crap blockbuster. The plots of the marvellous original books, though far-fetched, had a sort of plausibility, and didn't try to overdramatise every single detail of plot and character. The characters were basically decent, with flawed heroes and villains who tended to be credible human beings (e.g. the Bird brothers gang) who could even show repentence. The film, in contrast, seems to be trying (too hard) to do the opposite in every respect. Red Rackham's descendant shows up in a sort of bizarre rekindled good-vs-evil blood feud, and everything builds up to a (yawn) spectacular climactic battle with dock cranes.<br /><br />A film, in short, which diligently erases all signs of originality in plot or character, so that we are left with the ridiculous bland, bombastic formula of any hollywood film. Keep your money in your pockets.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The book was not what I expected it to be but it was still very well written. Perks of Being a Wallflower is one to remember.
0765325950|5.0|Great ending to a great series. The entire book is nothing but adrenaline pumped action without a single dull moment. The only downside is the fact that the series is over but I am already looking forward to re-reading the entire thing.
B00AE2I4WK|2.0|Worst step up movie, second only to the first one. Boring. If you like romance and dancing though, it's not that horrible a movie, it could honestly be a lot worst.
0425263916|5.0|I was stuck on the Bared to You Gideon & Eva relationship and the 2nd book kept me equally hooked. I can't for Entwined now & I have to wait until summer. It's really a great romance filled with hot love scenes, much much better written than Fifty Shades of Grey!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the best story I have read in a long time.  I can't wait for the next set of books.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great book it keep me reading half the night<br />David.nwingle<br />I will tell my friends about this book and share it with them thanks for the great book
B007IX00ZC|5.0|Takes a pretty long damn time to ship anything to iceland, still I've heard this album already so I most likely will love it
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I honestly thought this would be a lame movie, but my friends' constant praise of this movie moved me to watch it, it's really good - way better than I thought; I highly recommend it.
B002O5M4SA|4.0|Love this movie.  Will always do.  Profound thought provoking reflections surface in the mind who likes to observe and learn from small things.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|One of the best and most creative works in a long time. I cannot wait until the next books are released.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I'm and in 8th grade and I love this calculator. Other calculators wouldn't let me do squaring with triangles which is what I'm doing in algerba now. This calculator saved my butt from getting a zap. For that I am forever greatful. :):):)
B000P6PVLC|2.0|For such a long movie, it sure didn't have much of a point.  Best thing about it was the Moroccan dessert scenery.  Lots of goats and goat women...  It was a waste of talent and time. My advice is to give this one a miss.
B004Y042N8|2.0|Many of the puzzles can be completed quickly. They are not very challenging and once you figure out what works for one of the puzzles you can apply the same strategy to many more.
B00881VLCE|4.0|This is a fun and easy puzzle game. You can make it as difficult as you like by changing the number of pieces that make up the puzzle!. As another reviewer stated it is easy to select the ads because they are right next to the well that the pieces are in. It is a good thing though that the pieces that are not being used can be placed back in the well until you are ready to use them. It gets four stars from me due to ad placement. It is otherwise a great game for the jigsaw puzzle lover.
B009X01C64|5.0|works great love the stand and rotate feature, i travel a lot so its nice to have on airplanes to set on the table
