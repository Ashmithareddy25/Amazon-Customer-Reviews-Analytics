B000VZY9OM|3.0|there are a few songs I liked the first 3 but the rest was and is just background noise.  your much better off buying his newest recording &#34;the next day&#34;

B0012HCASA|5.0|If you've seen all the movies and felt like you were \\"done\\" with The Terminator stories, give this show a try. It's excellent. Well constructed and acted. Summer Glau is especially excellent. Very sad it only ran two seasons.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|Cute and light movie about a girl with ambition in the morning TV industry who softens an old codger.  It's predictable but that's OK if you want something light.
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|un très bon blu ray de bonne facture,une très bonne qualité d'image et de très bons bonus,a recommander à tous les fans.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Every woman in business, or thinking about a career outside of the home, should read this book.  Some information was not new to me but the insights she offers were tremendous.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Absolutely awesome.  What an amazing story.  The background information, the geographic descriptions, the intensity of the mission.  All that said, there were many times I had to laugh out loud.  John Corey is crazy nuts and I love him.  He makes off the wall comments and I'm not sure why Kate puts up with him.  This was one of DeMille's best books yet because the subject matter, looking for the Cole bombing mastermind, hits us where it hurts.  The planning, execution,and secret mission details kept me on the edge of my seat.  There were many real facts about Yemen, the Cole, Muslim tradition, and psychological profiling of the hunted that I found astounding.  I could hug DeMille for this gift.  If you love DeMille, you will love &#34;The Panther&#34;, possibly his best book to date.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I have noticed that when the coins drop a lot of the time they are not counted right.  The game is ok but not fun when the coins drop and they don't get counted.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|This journey into the foster-cared for psyche was fascinating. Even though the heroine can be quite nasty, I found myself rooting for her success.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|What a long, almost bizarre road this band has taken.  From the early psychedelic-infused r&b, to their days as metal gods, to their present position of elder statesmen of hard rock, Deep Purple has maintained a high level of professionalism and musicality throughout the years.<br /><br />The 5-way split in songwriting credits does make it difficult to praise or condemn any particular member, although Gillan's lyrics often show a sly sense of humor.  There are some Genesis-like touches in Don Airey's keyboards, which enhance the music.  And Bob Ezrin's production evoke a variety of musical sensations, from the symphonic goth textures of \\"Vincent Price\\", to the smooth jazzy ambience of \\"Bodyline\\".<br /><br />It took 8 years for this album to be released, as the band is not getting any younger, hopefully it will not take another 8 for the next.
B00B4804KS|5.0|très grand film que l'on redécouvre avec plaisir,une conversion 3D aussi belle que celle de titanic,très bons bonus,a voir ou revoir pour les fans.
B00BLGZN1S|1.0|This movie is a pure insult to anyone who has ever worn the uniform.  The Sniper rifle the US troops have is German, which US troops would have thrown away.  Couldn't they find even 1 1903 Springfield rifle?  Then the whole thing went down hill from there.  The tactical moves they made were moronic. The military consultant should be barred from the movie industry.  Good WWII is \\"The Pacific\\" and \\"Band of Brothers\\". This move is the exact opposite.  It was as if they were trying to make it as ridiculous as possible.  The final straw was the low level bombing raid. Our bombers flew at over 25,000ft over Europe. That, along with the guy calling in air support from the P51's with a field walkie-talkie Left me wanting a double refund.<br />How dare they call it \\"Company of Heros\\" as the name commonly refers to the World famous Easy Company of the 506th regiment of the 101st AirBorne. If you are a Vet- do not watch this nonsense.  It will only infuriate you.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|I enjoed this newest Depeche Mode  Cd. Slower than I remember from past music, but still interesting, and sounding good/
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|So moving and intense that the philosophical tutorial captures you before you see it coming. Its messages will haunt you, stalk you, and inhabit your mind until you submit to the spiritual growth the story requires.

B00BB22GQM|3.0|Ok, so this came out as #1 Billboard albums for last week. Who knew that so many people even knew about Vampire Weekend? I have been listening to it on loop for the better part of two days now and I have to say that it grows on you with the 15th listening sounding better that the first. I'm finding that I hear different things in this music the more times I play it. For instance, what's up with the Witchy Woman intro on 'Hannah Hunt'? Does 'Hudson' sound a bit like a Danny Elfman soundtrack for a Tim Burton movie? The beginning of 'Step' could have been from St. Pepper's' and why include ALL of those bay area cities when one would have been fine? I'm not much for lyrics as I thought that 'Diane Young' was about 'dying young' every single time I heard it on the radio. Oh so many girls.<br /><br />The Vamps are a good band with catchy lyrics and songs that can fit into many different genres. I don't see this as a departure from those poppy ditties. They are still there as in 'Unbelievers', 'Finger Back' or 'Worship You'.<br /><br />So why 3 stars? This is a good solid outing. It's not earth shattering or something that hasn't been done before. Definitely worth the $10 bucks for a hard copy and Amazon lets you rip it and add it to your music files right away.
B00AYATBP6|5.0|Porcupine Tree leader Stephen Wilson's latest is like past music, moody, and dynamic at the same time. A good companion to his other solo efforts.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|I only gave it 4 stars because of the swearing.  It was a very well done movie otherwise - great acting, scenes, props, all very realistic.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|the game its fun an has alot of interesting dinosaurs ,tho it seems to be hard most the times expecially with the underwater dinosaurs or when u try to find newer ones,the missions are fun but complicated but all it be a awesome game.
B00CW665VI|4.0|I can't believe a woman wrote this book.  The perspective in the book is from a completely male (jack ass) point of view.  He is all self-involved until a woman with a bit of an edge, not to mention, education turns his world upside down.  It was nice to see him grovel.  Great job!
B0072X2NUS|5.0|Vince Clarke and Martin Gore are familiar with each other, and their music on this disk shows it. Good rhythms and great music.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|My 6 year old loves it. Easy to play and graphics are great. Would highly recommend this to anyone. It's cool.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Before you watch this movie, make sure to watch the first two Iron Man movies, Captain America and Thor. This will get you familiar with the characters and make for a perfect viewing experience. You don't need to see those other movies though, it is perfectly watchable without it, although you would miss some references, which aren't that important to the film anyway.<br /><br />You can't get much higher than this in terms of quality. The film is a perfect blend of action and comedy. It is great for all ages. Comic book nerd or not. I highly recommend this movie to people of all ages, especially families.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much. The author has a terrific sense of humor and I didn't want it to end :)
B00A9X9VAI|1.0|I saw this in the theater.  My expectations were high after seeing the trailer and reading the reviews.  I was sadly highly disappointed.  The trailer covers the first \\"half\\" of the movie.  That section of the movie is great.  It sets up the world and a very interesting plot.  The second \\"half\\" flips the bird to the first part so it can drag you away kicking & screaming into a completely different movie.  The rules of time travel are ignored and the plot setup in the first half is ignored.  It goes from being a movie about fighting who you might become in the future to a movie about whether its OK to go back in time to kill Hitler when he was a baby.  Even the transition to the second half is silly with scene straight out of Benny Hill.  The standard excuse people give for most positive reviews seems to be \\"Well if we want Hollywood to keep taking chances on high concept sci-fi movies then we need to support movies like Looper.\\"  I think that is the exact wrong attitude to have because all it does it ensure that the sci-fi movies we do get are all garbage like Looper.
030758836X|5.0|This is such a good book I have recommended it to several friends.  It was recommended to me and I couldn't put it down!!

B007Y36K46|1.0|the quality was so bad...there was a black and  grey screen at the top and bottom and the screen so that more than 1/3 of the tv was grey and black....don't order this movie though amazon

B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Gone are the days that would take me weeks to finish a 400 something page novel. I finished A Thousand Splendid Suns in 3 days. And there is nothing \\"splendid\\" in this agonizingly sad, depressing, horror-stricken story of women and children who are brutalized, beaten, and treated worse than animals, with a life that begins depressingly sad and gets progressively worse until you can't take it anymore, but you keep reading because the story telling is brilliant, and you - if not the characters - want some kind of revenge, but the author keeps you hungry, hungry for a simple taste of justice and a simple drop of satisfaction. He keeps driving his mad blood-thirsty wife-beating loathsome male characters - save for one - and you want to tear at them with a knife and finish them off yourself!<br /><br />Sooooooo, as you can see, it was not a happy book, and I'll not read the other stories by Hosseini at this time simply because, like Mariam, the truly sad character, said it so well, \\"what good does it do?\\" What good does it do knowing the heart-wrenching brutalities that go on still in the 21st centuries in countries like Afghanistan? What good does it do to know about it? What good is it to witness horribly wrong things from a distance but not be able to help?<br /><br />As for writing style, I loved Hosseini's story telling style. Being from Iran, the Farsi words that he throws at you are from my mother tongue so they had a particularly hard sting and their meaning went deep inside me, awakening distant memories of the horrific government of Iran that has more than its own shares of similar brutalities.<br /><br />Yes, indeed the human spirit does thrive and that is a beautiful thing to see, but oh goodness, if I had to go back, I am not sure I'd read this book to get an example of the human spirit thriving.<br /><br />I struggled between the 3 and 4 stars. Yes the book was GOOD, very good. The writing is exquisite. Sometimes he goes on and on about descriptions that I could care a little less about and I had far less interest in the politics of Afghanistan than I did in the characters in the story so those parts dragged on a bit but still, the story moved forward and kept me hoping against hope that there were be an ounce of happiness reserved for at least one character .....<br /><br />If you want to enter the dark, depressing, and lonesome world of the women in the Islamic regimes such as Iran or Afghanistan, go on and read this .... it will give you more than you bargain for! And remember, this work of fiction might as well be fact. These things do happen to the women in that world all the time.could care a little less about and I had far less interest in the politics of Afghanistan than I did in the characters in the story so those parts dragged on a bit but still, the story moved forward and kept me hoping against hope that there were be an ounce of happiness reserved for at least one character .....<br /><br />If you want to enter the dark, depressing, and lonesome world of the women in the Islamic regimes such as Iran or Afghanistan, go on and read this .... it will give you more than you bargain for!

B00BHMETKC|4.0|This is the academy award winner for best picture. Starring Ben Affleck. It tells a wonderful tale based on something that had happened.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It's been a great game and I did buy some gems when they went on sale. But it's not worth all that. If you have enough patience, you can build your bits and gems. Also, no one that I know plays. So I cant collect some of the gems that are only received that way.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Definitely an entertaining movie for a boring night at home. Lots of great actors in it & the stories are actually quite moving!  I love the true-to-life portrayal of pregnancy as well!
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Not much else to say but one of the best TV shows available on Prime, the acting is incredible and high quality streaming.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|This movie was about an hour too long. Very predictible, somewhat funny and dragged out beyond what it needed to be.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|Was very entertaining. Following everyone from scene to scene and how they would go from good to bad was interesting.
B00CL68NOG|2.0|I had high expectations for this movie... what's not to like with these two lead actors, Rogen & Streisand? I'd say they're usually two of the funniest in Hollywood. Unfortunately, this movie just didn't cut it. Way too slow.
B002436WFI|5.0|i read this book several years ago and was so glad to find this on dvd.  i have every book terry pratchett wrote, i so enjoy his writing. this movie is funny and entertaining for all ages. i especially like the camera and the luggage (have to know the story by book or movie to know what i am talking about).
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Almost like the book. There are many added scenes that were not in the book, but you can tell this was to tie in the movie with Lord of the Rings.
B0041KKYBA|3.0|It's intriguing. I'm not sure I agree with it all but it's thought provoking, and well put together. Certainly worth the time.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This is an all time favorite.  The ending is not predictable and yet it is amazing.  Highly recommended to adults.  Not for young kids due to sexual violence (rape) in the prison.
B002361MLA|5.0|Before I stumbled across this book I have been at a vipassana meditation retreat in Thailand. The book delivers exactly the theory of what I was practicing and achieved and realized in the temple. Thus I was able to relate to it 99%.
B008MLNDEO|4.0|I loved the movie, and the music is just as good and is something that I can take with me and listen to at anytime.
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|As usual the kids really enjoy these games and movies. I did not really pay attention, but my kids wanted to watch it over and over.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Great action movie. Tom Cruise kills it as usual. If you liked the earlier Mission Impossible movies, then you will like this one.
B005HED08I|5.0|It's fun to follow how the movies tie into the original series story lines. The original cast was great  thanks
B007HO392S|5.0|carrie blows me away with every album, there are always songs beyond the ones picked to be her hits that are awesome
B00003CWN3|5.0|My wife loves this movie!  I couldn't find this dvd until I searched for it on Amazon.  It arrived on the 1st day it was due.  The purchase was better than I expected!
B00499QUK2|5.0|The tongue in cheek dialogue and quick wit has kept me a fan of (good) British shows. To see a modern version of Mr. Holmes, is a delight for those of us who love good mysteries. And I suggest  to anyone that this Holmes and Watson is worth the viewing.
B00003CXAE|5.0|They liked it, but were in awe at how times have changed so much. Great deal on the movie. Yay.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|love this cd great compositions, great band instruments, great vocals, just great great great - hate having to do this to show how much i like a product if i didn't like it i wouldn't buy it sorry
B004G6009U|5.0|Prompt delivery by Amazon and this DVD is great!  We have Enchanted, Tangled, and Wall-E now, and we love watching one of these when the news stories are so bad we just want to get away.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Right away I could see that I was using a channel right in the middle of a crowd of other systems. It also showed where the empty channel was.
B00005JLSE|5.0|replacing vhs's when the vcr broke. What can one say about this movie except it is one of the best musicals of all time to me. at lease i watch it the most. everyone does a good job in the movie and i even watch it on my ipod at the gym as it is good for exercise. so i just had to replace my vhs and this dvd was excellent in all respects.
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|The book gave me a little more insight into the basic food pattern for this diet --&#34;Eat 500 calories for 2 out of 7 days per week.&#34; Does this diet work??  I've lost about 10 lbs  in about 7 weeks.  It's simple.  The 500 calorie days are easy -- just plan ahead.  I used to plan each 'every diet day' now I plan only two days per week. The rest of the week, I eat as usual.  The book did give me some ideas on what to include on my 500 calorie days. However, during the last couple of years, using the 'plate' method, I've learned to add more vegetables to our meals; eating healthier. .
B002QCD2QO|4.0|In the 1970s, the big horror movie that had everyone talking was The Exorcist, which, sadly, started the trend toward relying on special effects and gore to spook an audience.  Wicker Man is a much finer film with no special effects and no gore, yet it stands up much better than The Exorcist, relying on the suggestion that these happy pagans living their blissful life on their island aren't all they seem to be.  Ed Woodward is a hero to sympathize with, a highly moral (and devout) man who is completely out of his element among these people who, he suspects, have sacrificed a child and may be set to sacrifie someone else (guess who the intended victim is).  Christopher Lee (most famous as Dracula and Count Dooku) predictably turns in a fine performance as the suave but evil \\"lord\\" of this pagan island.  This may be too low-key for anyone born after, say, 1980, but adults should enjoy it.
0307949508|5.0|This book is a very good read, and I am over half way through it.  It is a great value for the money, and it is very intriguing.  I can't wait to get to the end and then get the next book!  It was delivered quickly, too!
B001AXU1CS|5.0|bought this to update from vhs when our combo player broke. this is a musical i never get tired of. the music is great. my dvd arrived in good shape and played well. a classic musical with songs i love. travolta and newton john were perfect.
1878424319|5.0|this book has changed my life! I will read it over & over again & always get something out of it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow. Don't read this if you are prone to depression. Read it if you like a good twisted tale. The book pretty much sums up why I hate public opinion.
0307383415|5.0|I really enjoyed this read, I think it will be a real relic-gem for my collection in years to come, as Obama's legacy develops over time. I found myself able to relate with many of the issues that Obama discusses in this book.
B000NIVJHM|5.0|a movie i have watched many times. bought this when my vhs broke and decided to replace all my vhs's. i rewatch this movie frequenly and it never gets stale. it speaks for something in the experience of my generation. but the music is timeless and filled with memories as is the whole politic scene depicted. loved it again.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The only issue thus far is when you get a new seed, it slows down.  Other than that it is great.<br />Installed on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1&#34;
B009AP2G26|1.0|The new characters are blah and they stretch themselfves to thin trying to cover to many things but end up covering nothing.
0316548189|4.0|my copy was in good shape, and this is another story that I think improves the quality of the character that reads it.
B00006DEFA|5.0|my vhs broke and i am replacing all my remaining vhs's. this is one of my favorite movies. as is mozart's music. won academy awards as it should have and is a timeless movie. i haev watched it frequenly and will again.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Cool series filled with chills and thrills!  The thrill-ride never subsides in this horror series!  I hope they bring it back for many many more seasons!
0142421715|5.0|Please keep in mind that this review will have spoilers for the first novel in this series, Matched. If you haven't read Matched, I highly recommend you read it before you read this review.<br /><br />After The Society has separated Cassia and Ky, sending Cassia to live with her family in the Farmlands and Ky to the Outer Provinces to fight the war against The Enemy, their love story seems hopeless. But Cassia is motivated to do whatever it takes to get to Ky, including sneaking onto a plane headed right for the front lines. When she miraculously gets close enough to where Ky has been, she learns that he has escaped to go search for her. As Cassia chases after Ky, she learns new things about Xander that further complicate this love triangle. Told in alternating perspectives of both Cassia and Ky, this installment of the Matched trilogy is full of adventure and helps the reader gain insight to Ky's perspective.<br /><br />I was surprised to find so many negative reviews for this book after I read it and thought it was better than the first in the series! So let me defend my rating, because I stand by it. I didn't quite believe Cassia's love for Ky in Matched which made it difficult to appreciate the story overall. In Crossed, however, Cassia and Ky are the central story and, as much as Condie tries to keep Xander in this love triangle, I don't feel that her efforts were enough to make him relevant to this book until the end. This helped me digest Cassia and Ky are a unit and get past my complaints about their relationship.<br /><br />Furthermore, despite Cassia and Ky almost literally going to the ends of the Earth for each other (at least from their limited perspective of the Earth), both experience doubts and see the limitations of their relationship in this book. This is refreshing compared to their teenage love phase. Both are maturing quickly and are looking further into the future than they had before. I thought that Condie was brave to give them an impasse that is difficult to compromise to prove how mature they are in their love for each other. It also gives a little faith that Xander might have a fighting chance!<br /><br />This book is full of adventure and exploration of a new world never before seen or experienced by Cassia. It also includes new characters that help uncover new sides of both Cassia and Ky that we haven't previously seen before. I guess some readers may perceive the Cassia and Ky's journey to find each other to be a bit slow, but I definitely didn't. I thought Condie did an excellent job moving the story forward with the landscape in addition to the poetry used in the first book. I only wish there were more illustrations of The Carving to help me better imagine what Condie was illustrating.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I loved Crossed more than I loved Matched, so if you read Matched, I consider this a must-read!! Full of adventure, love and teenagers maturing into adults. Good for high schoolers and advanced junior high readers! 4.5/5 stars - but I'm rounding up!
B00C061I3K|5.0|For whatever reason, Daft Punk is more than just music for me- it is emotion. They take my soul by the arm and say &#34;Hey, listen to this.&#34;<br /><br />Like a work of art, observing this album at different times affects you differently. When I first played this in my car in the afternoon, I was a little disappointed. I had expected an electronica-disco blowout. I felt that &#34;Get Lucky&#34; was the tip of the iceberg. It was, but not in the way I had imagined.<br /><br />I played this again later that night, using good-quality headphones. My impressions of this album changed instantly. My disappointment turned from the album to myself. As I headed to bed, I thought, &#34;How could I have thought this album was anything less than great?&#34;<br /><br />My second listen cemented my feeling about this album- the other morning, my girlfriend was playing this as she was making me breakfast (I am a lucky man, yes I am). I sat there in a beautiful aural haze as &#34;Beyond&#34; played. The down-tempo of this album was a perfect start for my morning and it carried me throughout my day.<br /><br />This album is not imposing. This album is not obvious in its greatness. It will not instantly impress you. It will, however, give you a greater appreciation for Daft Punk. They have crafted a fantastic album that everyone should give a listen to.
B004QBWU02|5.0|bought this recenly for my husband. a great movie but a bit exaggerated for those of us who lived thru this. male characters more fleshed out and that is a pity but that is the movie they made. all in all good memories of a by gone area. younger people prob would enjoy it too.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Christian Bale plays the best batman ever.  Only  thing I didn't like was seeing batman being tortured, but it was necessary to the storyline.
B00A6J9SM6|5.0|This is a great book that will help anyone wanting to learn the essential skills and tips to mastering PowerPivot.
B005LAIHGI|1.0|I saw it advertised on Amazon Prime; view it for free! Well, I could not watch it all. I keep on pushing Fast-Forward.<br />Basically, it proves that vulgarity can not makeup for the lack of a story. It is not funny either. It is just too gross and too stupid.
B0094MUA4Q|5.0|I am totally crazy about this series. I am not a fan of horror movies but I love this series.
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|One of the best horror movies I've seen in a long long time!  I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys horror movies!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really in that get to raise and ride a horse. You see we don't have enough space for a horse so the only way I can &quot;have a horse&quot; is through a game or a friend who has one.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I didn't read the size and was blown away at how big it was.  I'm actually glad I chose it over the higher priced Logisys Gamer Storm.<br /><br />It cools like crazy!  Extremely quiet!  I can't stress this one enough.  When I walk into the room I actually have to look at the computer to make sure it's on.<br /><br />The heat sinks are pretty cool to the touch even after over clocking my Phenom II X3 720 from a 2.8 gig to a 3.6gig. I like how it can be upgraded with a second fan on the other side of the sinks.  Also includes the brackets you need add the second fan if you wish.<br /><br />One drawback.  Crappy instructions.  You get a baggy full of parts and the instructs aren't great.  If you're a visual person like me, it's easy to figure out.  I have a Gigabyte motherboard and you actually have to pull the board to swap out the back-brace so this MONSTER cooler has support and a way to attach.  I'm assuming it will be this way with most boards because of the weight of this cpu cooler.<br /><br />Even with it's bad instructions, this is SO worth the money!!  Looks bad-ass if you have a plexy side and an LED inside the case too. ;)
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Purchased the soundtrack after seeing the motion picture.  It is sooooo good.  I listen to it again and again and again.
B00AJLHUA8|3.0|Was a little disappointed in this movie.  Was expecting more from it especially with the stars involved in this.  Cautiously recommend.
B00371XIJE|5.0|This movie had me in great floods of tears. I cried like a newborn baby. I couldn't stand every 5 minutes without busting out tears. This movie was beautiful! It made realize that this movie has the potential to cause world peace if it became more noticeable to public. I am glad I watched this movie and I HOPE more movies like this will come out soon!! Rest in peace, Hachiko.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|...but still not as good as the first season. The end was far too convoluted and tidy for me. Still, worth the money and definitely worth the watch.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Fast shipping, I love this movie combo, I've tackled seeing all 4 movies,  even the one with Shia le&#34;whine a lot&#34;
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This movie impacted me so that it was the beginning of a journey to become a vegetarian and a gardener. The more I discovered the suffering of those animals, the way corporations manipulate our food sources while killing us in the process in the name of profit did it for me. A must see.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|While this might be sacrilege in some circles, at times I enjoyed this soundtrack more than the original recordings. This was very well done. The songs were sung from the heart with great arrangements behind it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Overall great story with plenty of room for other books.  Very entertaining to toy with some of the thoughts this book leaves a person with!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|great game. daughter watches show and now loves the game. she loves building ponies houses and assigning jobs. the narration is a nice touch too. it tells the story as you go
159315724X|5.0|Totally got so much out of this book. I knew a lot of the things he was talking about but took in the information a different way that was even more helpful. I actually told my children they were going to read it.
B005SLS3VY|4.0|I enjoy the series and the plots which have kept my interest through out the book,,i recommend the book to your readers
B005IQZB14|2.0|This was a book club book for me, or I probably wouldn't have read it, but I loved the idea of following someone's story as they took on this amazing adventure, but this author was a piece of work.  She had no idea that everybody she encountered really thought she was an idiot.  She is the ultimate victim and can't get over herself.  Listening to her talk about her life was like nails on a chalkboard.  She never takes responsibility for any of the drama (mostly self-inflicted) in her life.  I loved Bill Bryson's &#34;A Walk in the Woods&#34; and was hopeful that this would be a book about a similar - maybe more serious hiker taking on another - more difficult epic American adventure. It's not.  It's a tale of a woman who has no idea what she is doing, going on a journey where she relies on the kindness of strangers to keep her alive and only by their graces and blind luck does she make it through.  She's a pretty disgusting person and I'm sorry now that I gave her money through the purchase of this book.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I read this in high school many years ago, but lacked the maturity to truly understand it.  I'm enjoying it much more this time around!
B0065RIJ3W|4.0|Very well written, all concerns regarding cost, weight issues, temperature considerations, space requirements, plants to grow, and fish to keep were covered in great detail. This is the only book I've bought on this subject and it has convinced me that I don't need to buy more.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|Its worth the money spent, i wish more locations were unlocked. Wouldnt change a thing about the app, i hope they keep coming out with more!
B0097GVJWQ|2.0|I would not recommend this for all ages.  It is pretty spooky with all of the satanic and demonic stuff in it.  I would not recommend this for a child.
0689835604|3.0|I gave this to my 1-year-old granddaughter.  She was not interested at all.  She kept trying to find something to press or squeeze to make noise, and when she couldn't, she gave it up.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time.  I even recommended it to my sister to read on her flight to china and she loved it too.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I had a Ms Pac man game and played it until it finally quit.  Good to see old game revisited and we don't need guns and shooting games to have fun
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|The game is very fun to play and self directed. The background music is soothing and calming. I enjoyed it.
B0053O89RY|5.0|The package was as expected. I have been a fan of Modern Family  for a while now, so I watched it already and everything worked perfectly!!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Considering that I was the director of a small facility for severely disabled children/teens with one in an iron lung...I emotionally was pulled into this movie hook, line and sinker.  Yes, I am a guy, and I have been a nurse for 30 years; needless to say, I wept at parts of this movie.  First off, I feel confident saying...only a guy can know the depth of longing for someone else, or in this case...someone... to do the touching down &#34;there.&#34;  Paint on whatever cultural and religions excuse for sublimation you choose and I am still saying it is where men live.  So...impossible not to relate.  Who isn't looking to find someone to accept who we are and be non-judgemental about our &#34;needs,&#34;  but add the challenge of a body that is anything BUT the marketed version of beauty and desirability; and, yes, you do start entering the domain of the sublime.  So the story is about... I am not sure there is a greater gift of caring about another human being.  This movie goes way beyond a naked Ms. Hunt and the focus on the physical acts of sex to how we accept and love ourselves so we can accept and love others. Anyone, yes, talking to you ladies, and my daughter, who &#34;hates&#34; themselves because they do not look like the models in magazines needs to think a minute or two about this type of reality.  Knocked my socks off.
0684857219|5.0|I owned this book before when it first came out.  I have no clue what happened to it so I bought it again.  A definite must read.  very informative and show some history in the sport.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Love this app - am a happy paid customer.  Numerous combinations, binaural options, &amp; can play in background while using other apps. SO jealous of folks who are getting this app free today! - contacted friends &amp; family specifically to be sure that they grabbed it today!
B001UG56ES|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie and should have purchased it instead of rented it!  Good for all ages.  Give it go!
B000000ORX|5.0|Sure Ms. Mitchell is a great poet, artist and musician, with a long history of evolution.  This is my favorite work.  I am at a loss to try to explain why, but I find myself playing a number of tracks again, and again, and again.  The stories float on syncopated rhythm melodies.  Let her tell you herself.
0736092269|5.0|This book shows everything I needed to see.  I know the exercises, but was great to see exactly what muscles are worked.
B000022TSY|5.0|This was always a great story, and presented in an unusual but great way.  A film that can be watched over and over, and always comes out new.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|it's good entertainment for when you have nothing better to do and are just killing some time in line or something.
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|I had a really bad time trying to keep up with this movie. At times I was asking myself why are you still watching this thing. I may be slow but this movie just left me in the dust.........I tried to watch it on two occasions but both were the same.......... over my head. I like a movie to let me escape into the story for a couple of hours, not test my ability to keep up with a movie that is way over the top. If you are looking for a movie that will let you enjoy the story and entertain you in the process maybe you should pass on this one............
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|If you take a lot of notes on different subjects, then you'll love this ap.  Easy to use, read only option, color coded groupings, and title cover or pages.  Change number of pages or how it's grouped, with back-up option.  Only thing I would change is that I would like to see option to truly arrange books the way you want instead of just preset ways, and a way to rearrange pages in notebook once it's written out.
B00003CXB2|5.0|This film shows so much going on in those days, and Lawrence's own actions were well beyond those that most people could even do, but he did them and came out okay - at least, up till his motorcycle accident.  The film is a big one, but is worth its size since it shows so much so interestingly and so well acted and shown to us.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a hard fun game that I play all day. The only problem I have is I don't know how to update it.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|I had difficulty finishing the book because of the disturbing imagery of torture and deprivtion. It is well written and certainly gives vivid insight into what life is like in North Korea.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|Wonderful part two of  a terrific trilogy .Great acting and dialogue.in a lovely setting.The chemistry between the actors is palpable.I loved every minute of it.
B009R659L8|5.0|I truly loved this book!  It is a typical Mary Higgins Clark novel.  I love her writing.  It has great characters and is one of her typical suspense novels.  I can't wait for her next book...hope it is about the Regan family.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Well written story of Alice's journey through diagnosis and the processes of Alzheimer's. It was heartbreaking and wonderful at the same time.
1574214276|5.0|After 'doing' zentangles for a while I found that I had completely 'left brained' it and was doing specific drawings. Not at all what had first attracted me to Zentangle.  This book has gotten me back in the groove, using it as a form of meditation.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Jennifer Lawrence was very good. I found the theme very simplistic and emphasizing violence. Violence pervades the stories and movies that young people are handed.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Good again. Matthew is always good but as a lawyer he is even better. Seen it and I would watch it again..
030758836X|5.0|I purchased this book on the advice of others who loved it.  It took me awhile to start to read it and once I did I couldn't put it down!
B00C0W08XK|5.0|I like this game because you get a good brain workout.  I recommend you start out on the easy level to get the hang of the game and then advance when you feel comfortable moving on.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is a fun read!  It is well written and the author leaves you never quite knowing what to expect.  The characters are well developed and truly damaged individuals.  It's an easy read and will leave you wondering what happens after the book ends.  Everyone in our book club enjoyed it and there was plenty to discuss.  I would highly recommend it!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|QT is an awesome story teller... and we should never forget all the despicable cruelty to our fellow human beings used as slaves.  Hard to watch some of the graphic violence... but the story is fab... QT doesn't disappoint with his usual blend of humor and horror.
0345803485|3.0|And now there will be a movie?  Really?  I found the characters to be unrealistic and pathetic.  I don't really understand how female readers find the male character appealing in anyway.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|Never really been into these types of games.  Just wanted to give it a try to see if I would enjoy it, but not for me.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|My wife talked me into reading this, and I'm glad she did.  I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Wow, what a great story.  I'm looking forward to reading the next in the series (SHIFT).
B00CNZ17DO|4.0|WTF?! I still buy CD's.  I do not download!! I hate it when the record companies decide to put bonus tracks on the download version or sell a deluxe version for a few dollars more than the regular version.  Stop wasting money and ruining the business and just put out the best version possible to everyone so we don't have to search for the one we want!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a great book, I'm interested in books like this a romantic kind of book, I do recommend this book:) it is a wonderful,keep me wanting to read more to see what happens next,romantic\love book<3 I do think a mature adult should read this...though it is not really something a child should or would like!
B00C2VIA52|3.0|Pro's<br />- great animations<br />- some good card art even though some pics are repeated for other cards<br />- pillage and quest system<br /><br />Con's<br />- card / rune prices are high<br />- some rare cards are game breaking especially if drawn early<br />- AI is feels based on large healthpool , and some crazy hero abilities<br /><br />Summary<br />Overall a fun ccg with great animations and challenging npc's. Yet is bogged down with some crazy powerful rare cards that can defeat most decks that lack them. Prices are steep for cards based on randomness. I wouldn't mind dropping the money for a booster system but for 2 or 4 random cards...<br />Just lvl up 3 characters for runes instead of buying single common cards to get your decks started helped me out.  Tip- pillage your way to greatness and run your missions.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|This is the first book in the Heroes of Olympus series by Riordan.  There are five books planned for this series, the series is a spin-off from the Percy Jackson series and takes place after the last Percy Jackson book.  I enjoyed the book, it was well done. If you enjoyed the Percy Jackson series I think you would enjoy this book as well.  You don't have to read the Percy Jackson series to understand what is going on in this book, however that series does provide a lot of excellent background for this new series.<br /><br />I listened to this on audiobook and really enjoyed it.  The narrator did an excellent job with the different character voices and with conveying the characters' emotions.  This book uses a different narrator than the Percy Jackson series which was a good idea for starting a new series like this.  I would definitely recommend listening to this on audiobook if you enjoy audiobooks.<br /><br />The book is told from three points of view.  Jason, Piper, and Leo all go to the Wilderness School for troubled children.  Jason, however, has no memory of how he got there or who he is.  Piper is the daughter of a famous actor and has a secret of her own.  Leo can build things, pretty much out of nothing.  All three of them end up at Camp Half-Blood and are sent on quest to help the Gods face a new and dangerous enemy.<br /><br />This book was a solid addition to the extended Percy Jackson world.  This book features a different set of characters.  It's a bit formulaic, but I liked the Percy Jackson books so I am okay with more of the samish type of story done in a different sort of way.<br /><br />All of the characters are very engaging, easy to relate to and interesting.  They all have a lot of depth to them and have secrets and mysteries they need to unravel.  As in the Percy Jackson books, all three of them need to figure out who their godly parent is.<br /><br />They go on a quest to free Hera from capture and along the way find out they are facing an enemy even more dangerous than the Titans.  I won't say a lot more than that about the plot.  As with previous books by Riordan there are lots of excellent action scenes and encounters with crazy and creepy mythological creatures.  There is a lot of humor throughout as well which makes these books a fun read.<br /><br />I pretty much liked all of the characters equally.  It was nice to have part of the story from a girl's (Piper's) perspective.  This should make the book a bit easier for young girls to relate to as well.  I enjoyed the characters' interesting powers too.<br /><br />As I said above the layout of the book is very similar to other books Riordan has written; the characters get a quest, fight an evil monster, travel, fight another evil monster, travel to beat a tight timeline and then confront a very big bad monster.  I enjoy the action and the mythological creatures, so I happen to enjoy the story even if it is similar in structure to previous ones.<br /><br />I love how this books builds on the Percy Jackson series some.  We do hear about the characters from the Percy Jackson series and they are in the story some.  They don't play a major part in the story, but they are there in the background and occasionally the foreground influencing events and helping out our new characters.<br /><br />Overall this was a very enjoyable and entertaining read.  I loved the expansion on the world we were introduced to in the Percy Jackson series.  I enjoyed the new characters a lot and found them interesting and easy to engage with.  I love the new plot and the new big bad enemy that these heroes have to face.  I also enjoyed the mythological fights and creatures that we run into throughout the story.  I definitely recommend this to fans of middle grade fantasy.  I also recommend to anyone who enjoyed the Percy Jackson series.  I can't wait to read The Son of Neptune now!emy even more dangerous than the Titans.  I won't say a lot more than that about the plot.

B005BGBPBG|1.0|wow this was painful  average of four stars?!?  i have to assume that there is a sweat shop full of studio interns somewhere in L.A. being forced to squeeze those stars out
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this. It kept me entertained! I would recommend it for readers a bit older. It does contain some graphic material.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Just starting to learn about tesla. An easy read for starters. Can't wait to learn more about this amazing man.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|I just love the original Hawaiian music in this film! I play it in my car and it takes me away to the islands.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|This film has a good storyline but it seems to drag on and fails to get to the point. I liked how there was some comedy  within the movie.
B008MM9630|5.0|The game has faults but it is still a good game. I can't buy diamonds or coins and it freezes a lot so please fix the problem.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this book. An excellent third book. I loved the ending. It was picture perfect. Would definitely read more books like this.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|ok this game is sooo much fun it has great graphics and its so entertaining, it was way worth the $2.99 that I paid for it. :) I just wish you could do more things with their hair other than that its great.
B0091REZMW|2.0|force closing and very frustrating. when it does work and not close it is very slow on my kindle fire. works great on ipad for my husband.
B0067EKYS6|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie, in contrast to the insipid and nearly unwatchable 1974 version with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow.<br /><br />Leonardo diCaprio is fabulous, as usual, and captures just right the cadence of speech and desperate fakery of the title character. Toby Maguire, what an inspired casting decision to have him play the narrator and third wheel, Nick Carraway! And Joel Edgerton, wow, I never knew he was such a great actor. He's been stuck for too long playing these action hero parts. Edgerton's subtle facial features were enough to communicate volumes. And then there is Carey Mulligan, perhaps not as inspired of a casting choice, but at least she isn't the neurotic and screeching Mia Farrow. Soft and sweet, but also useless and money-grubbing, Mulligan's version of Daisy Buchanan was still lovely and lovable enough to make one believe that a social climbing lying psychopath like Jay Gatsbay would fall for her, unlike the insane poodle that was Mia Farrow's version.<br /><br />A bit of a surprise, but highly recommended.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved the book, although parts of it were hard to read regarding abuse of children.  The main character is resourceful and triumphant  even after  a lack of nurturing and love all through her growing up years.  I know an amazing woman who had a childhood just like Victoria's and also has had a successful life.  The story has made me count my blessings again!!
B003K1EYM6|3.0|Exactly as ordered. sadly most &#34;stuff&#34; will not be displayed on my iPad through these connectors as &#34;not enough power&#34; is available to the adapters.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Consistently reverts back to posts from days if not weeks ago.  New posts are buried amongst old ones.  Not user friendly
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|This movie was better than expected - Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson really were the highlights. Wish the producers and marketing companies hadn't marketed toward only the Twilight crowd - the young, unknown actors were soooo much better than any of the Twilight actors/actresses. SO much better!!
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|This film was truly confusing.  There are 6 different story lines and attempting to keep them all straight was difficult at best.  There is a website that explains everything but it also ruins a first time watch with all the explanations.  Though personally I would rather have read the review and the explanations prior to watching the movie as the entire thing made more sense.  I seemed to be lost throughout most of the viewing.  It was fine once I knew what was actually going on.  The various characterizations were great once I knew who to watch for in which timeline.  I'd watch it again but it's not a keeper.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I ENJOY SCROLLING THROUGH ALL THE IMAGES AND FINDING PEOPLE THAT LIKE THE SAME THINGS I DO!<br />I LOVE IT!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|You ever see a film that you actually want to buy the DVD to keep? This is one of those films........Lets just say the acting, the cinematography, the directing actually EVERYTHING in this film was great. This film made my day.
B002RZZIXU|3.0|Confused story line but in spite of that it is readable and I quite enjoyed it. OK for a rainy weekend.
B002XXPNXG|4.0|I can relate to this: having a special time with another person, keeping every image fresh in your mind, and then being inspired to write a book. It's a realistic response. The characters were again very appealing. Both obviously saw the opportunity and seized upon it. I loved the way she kept reminding him of his flight and he kept replying. The ending was adorable in a very soulful way. This episode of their drama got a bit too cognitive at times. I felt like saying, &#34;Shut up and kiss the girl!&#34; But there remained a natural flow between these two that was very appealing.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|After the first level, the game won't run anymore on my Kindle.  It will launch as normal when you hit the icon, but then after the Marvel intro, it dumps back to the Kindle home screen.  Glitchy games are bad.
B00BEYYEE4|4.0|The movie overall is pretty good. There are definitely portions of it that I feel are just unimportant to the overall concept of the movie.. good amount of action and drama. Felt sloppy at times. Didn't detract from the overall experience.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Can't wait for Season 4.  But who can wait for October....ahhhh.  This season was very sad.<br />Who knew I would like a zombie show!
B002XXNSF6|4.0|The two main actors played their roles with a natural style that was irresistible. Many emotions were evoked. The ending was almost two impulsive. I mean, really, no phone numbers exchanged? No addresses? Nonetheless,it was very appealing.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|Long drawn out and extremely slow. Some great visuals but the trailers showed most of them. Wanted to like it, but very disappointed.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I really don't have a lot to say about this one. It does what I need it to do and then some. Actually, there are features on this app that I wouldn't necessarily use (like barometric pressure and visibility), but the layout is great and it even has moving pictures behind the weather information coinciding with the current weather conditions. I haven't had any issues with it. If you're looking for something that's going to do more than just give you the current temperature and a forecast, consider using this app.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|Cut The Rope: Experiments is a great way to kill time when you have a few minutes to spare. The game play is easy to learn but difficult to master.
8866137634|5.0|This works really well for having searchable notes uploaded to Evernote.  Now that Page Camera is available for the Android version of Evernote, it is even more useful.<br /><br />The one downside that I did not realize until after my purchase is that the notes you upload are not editable.  This is really more of a limitation of Evernote, and not the notbook itself.  Google Drive/Docs has this capability and I thought Evernote would, too.  Sadly this is not the case, at least not now.  Maybe this feature will come later.  The OCR of Evernote only gives a list of possible matches for your page uploads, it does not actually convert it to text.  So if you write &#34;coach&#34; in your notebook, and then upload and search it in Evernote, you might get hits on &#34;couch&#34; or &#34;cache&#34; or other similar-looking words.  EN will not turn your photos into an actual text document; once the photos are in EN, that is how they will stay, forever.  This is good enough for most of my uses, and the search function has been successfully returned results with good accuracy overall, even with my terrible handwriting.<br /><br />The notebook itself is nice and has a solid feel.  I haven't used the included Evernote stickers, because I'm not a 14 year old girl (j/k). But I can see how they would come in handy for some people with the auto-tagging functionality (Honestly the reason I haven't used them is because I don't use tags in Evernote very often, if ever).  The notebook is very classy, and the bright green highlights are actually kinda cool (originally I thought I would hate them).
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I could not put this book down. Jun Do's story is remarkable and the writing truly worth a Pulitzer. It was surprising to see how accepting the people of Korea were to their circumstances. The brutality of the government and the propaganda was disheartening but there are also some very poignant moments that provide some hope that the Korean people are no different than the rest of us. It is an extraordinary story told by an exceptional author.
B004DP9QFS|5.0|This one has a lot of features and provides more information than I expected. After all, I was just looking for something that provided the time for different parts of the world. The app gives solar and lunar information, the actual length of the day and night, and various other bits of information. Multiple settings options allow you to customize this application's map, clock, globe, screen, update interval, and location. TerraTime is attractive enough to keep it always on display (something that you could actually do with the Kindle Fire version).
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Fruit Ninja is a wonderful way to embark on your journey as a ninja. I haven't actually been able to test my skills in a real life fruit attack. However, I'm ready if it ever happens.
B0047YIHLE|4.0|Great Movies and its nice to have them in this set.  That being said, I did get a scare because the titles and packaging are not in English... but the movies are so it was ok.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This app works well with my Kindle Fire.  Easy to setup and use.  I was able to get my emails in no time at all.
B004LZF2LW|4.0|PolyClock World Clock is definitely a polyclock with the ability to display time information for multiple time zones, some of which you can choose yourself, and it even displays your selected zone on a map or globe (you can choose either one). There are several pre-set zones displayed that you could actually change or delete. You can change other features as well, such as the appearance of the time display and whether to use a 12-hour or 24-hour clock.<br /><br />I only gave this a 4 because the globe and map displays aren't particularly detailed and aren't very attractive (though if you change it to the satellite setting, it looks better).
B0056BMK6K|4.0|Purchased this book not expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised to find it useful, here and there, and definitely entertaining.
B005LMEB8E|4.0|I have her first two albums so I figured I'd get this one too while it was only $5. If you skip the first three songs then it's a pretty perfect album. I love all of that it has to offer from Together to For the Love of a Daughter.
B004X75RK4|4.0|It is fun to see people who are overbearing finally put in their place!  Enjoyed the dog and eagle scene.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I gave this as a gift so I have not viewed the movie but the recipient loved it. Seems like a great buy for the value.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Though real historical figures names are used, their relationships and timing of their place in the history of the Vikings have been fictionalized. If you suspend your knowledge of the history of the Vkings, this is a well written, well acted, enjoyable show. If any of you are interested in a real historical exploration of the Vikings and their conquests, read Hugh Montgomery's God-Kings of Europe series(available on Amazon).They did a great job casting,and writing this show. I can't wait for season 2!
193700788X|3.0|This book is written in the usual style but I just Hated how it ended, I wanted Sookie to end up with someone else.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Great show, fun characters, solid plot line.  The best of the &#34;star-gate&#34; shows.  I wish there were more shows of this caliper.
B009329ZF2|5.0|I gave this as a gift so I have not viewed the movie but the recipient loved it. Seems like a great buy for the value.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Katniss has become so weak and fragile and you can guess what's coming a mile away.<br />The story moves quickly enough but it drags on with the same recaps from the hunger games
B00AZRBLHO|3.0|As a blanket statement, I like the idea of trying to frame technical instruction around a narrative, and there are good aspects to this book.  If I'm to give critical feedback, there are two things that spoil the effort (though not to the point that I wouldn't recommend the book).  The first is that the initial setting is bedlam, and there are not enough people who know what's happening, and not enough people able to do what needs to happen.  That part rings true.  The problem is that I don't accept that by funneling everything to a kanban board is the be-all and end-all problem solver.  The authors are making a larger point about the similarity of IT processes to manufacturing processes, and that's also not a problem.  The problem is the way that the authors portray the inevitable train wreck as somehow the moment when they could take time to re-think their problems.  This doesn't seem reasonable.  To be sure, process re-engineering is an important and challenging thing, but they way it was described seemed a bit of a fairy tale, where up to that point the book seemed somewhat grounded in reality.  There are a lot of references to various Japanese business efficiency concepts, and while I don't discount them, they are not a magic wand.  On balance, I was able to glean some helpful concepts from this book, but I feel like it could have been so much better.
B000002B5L|5.0|I was born in the 80s and was a 12 yrs old when this album came out. Everyone in Brooklyn loved The Fugees!! I got this as a side Christmas gift for my husband last Year and it's such an awesome purchase. We listen to it ALL the time. Every track is good in my opinion. I wish music could still be fine quality like this. Lauren Hill is one of the best female rappers. None of today' rap music can compare. My item came in great condition also. If you're interested in buying this, just go ahead and do it already!!! :-)
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Easy to start and lots of fun time.<br />Can i make it to the next yard?<br />Start driving and you will be...
B0032CVAQQ|3.0|The messages and exercises are timeless, but it is a lot of overrated common sense.  It is practical advice if you have zero communication skills.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|WHAT WILL I DO WHEN IT IS OVER? SUCH GOOD ACTING.  THE WRITING IS SUPERB.  EVEN MY HUSBAND AND SON LOVE IT.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this period TV Show. I enjoy all the characters, as well as, the setting and plot. The castle is marvelous.
B000P0J024|5.0|If you love the Traveling Wilburys, and you probably do considering your here contemplating buying this CD/DVD set. It is a great collection of the best and hard to find rough cuts, great set. Worth it in my opinion.
B001QWBM62|2.0|Disappointed.  The volume is way too soft.  The operation is very difficult.  A friend who has an earlier model of the Zoom has tried this model and he is confused also.  He earlier model works well.  I am sorry I purchased this one.
B000001ESN|5.0|This disc was missing from my collection. Rush shows their amazingly tight musicianship from the starting track to the last note of the final track. If you listen to 2112  all the way through to Moving P ictures you can listen to this band finding their chops as you take the ride with them! I personally think it was their best period! The heavy keyboard period lost me a bit, but they are back with a vengeance  with Clockwork Angels! Saw them in Dallas back in November! Incredible!
B00000K3D4|5.0|A good family movie with a good moral point about wishing you or something was someone or something else. You don't know what you've got till it's gone. Very well done movie. Sad that everything has gone to CGI and true artistic talent is diminishing.
B008KTA64S|4.0|Based on reviews left by other Amazon users, I started listening to Gaslight Anthem with \\"59 Sound\\".  That is an excellent place to start, even though I already had the title track to this album.<br /><br />The more I listen, the more I think I like this album better.  I love \\"45\\", and \\"Handwritten\\" quickly made its way into my list of all-time favorite songs.  There's one track on this album that I don't just love, but it's so far down I think it would have been a b-side anyway.  It's short, but hideously repetitive, and not totally in the spirit of the rest of the album.  It's not a deal-breaker, because it can be flashed right past.<br /><br />Two thumbs up, highly recommend the album.<br /><br />(Not sure if it bears mentioning that I picked up \\"Handwritten\\" from Limelight at the movies.  It was their featured song one month.  In case anyone wonders if movie-goers pay attention to those things.)
B001AFF25W|5.0|What a great book on procrastination! The book is a very easy and quick read. The concepts are broken down and explained thoroughly. The is some repetition with the concepts, however, everyone is sure to learn something from this book.
B006RJTEIC|3.0|The script had the potential to make really good social commentary on where we headed through our continued reliance on technology, in the vein of THX 1138, but the cheesy effects, gratuitous nudity, and mediocre acting take enough of the edge off to spoil the effort. Still worth watching if you like 1984 or Brave New World style social commentaries.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I bought this because, of course, I needed it for my collection, but the price was great also.  Can't wait for the next ones to come out.
B006Z1XY7E|4.0|You're almost certainly going to have heard &#34;Somebody that I Used to Know&#34;, but there are a number of great tracks on this album.
B00908DDZM|4.0|Macklemore delivers smart rhymes over Lewis' often catchy production. Great up-tempo hip-hop as well as some food for thought.<br /><br />Very promising album--can't wait to hear more in the future.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I haven't finished it yet. but I'm really enjoying the creativity of S.King at this point in the book ,Bravo!
B004GYY714|5.0|This app is wonderful!!! I was listening to stations in Boston, Ireland, England and more. It was great to hear different music and news from all over. Must have WIFi to get it but is a great experience.
B007J2TMQ0|4.0|A book of amazing breadth..<br /><br />Aspects I particularly enjoyed were the manner in which the World leaders functioned, and bits I knew little about, such as what really happened in Crete, the war in Finland in 1939-40, and the Japanese incursions into China.<br /><br />We continue to hear much over the years about the Holocaust, and rightly so, but Beevor documents the more widespread bestiality of the Germans, Russians and Japanese during this war. As an example of this we certainly should not forget what happened to Poland<br /><br />I was often rather lost in the detail of many of the campaigns. Perhaps it is heretical to make this point, but I do believe that the wider audience would have benefited if the book as presented had been regarded a s draft, and smoothed out to a consistent level
B003TJR2HS|5.0|This works great for extending out of my lifeproof case.  No problems or issues after 9 months of occasional use.
B00BQHA0UQ|5.0|CD came on time in great condition. I love the music and so does my friend who I ordered this for. Would buy again
B001HN694K|5.0|Got this one from Amazon because it was cheaper here than anywhere else. I don't &#34;waste&#34; money on cable so we watch movies. This movie is an excellent watch.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It is written in a believable way and the characters are great. I have not finished it yet but am enjoying it so far
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have been using Evermore for years and have the apps on my iPod touch, android phone and kindle fire.
B000VEA38E|5.0|Great set of discs, well worth the price.  If you loved the Star Wars trilogy (original) then you'll enjoy having this in your library.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I typically do not care to write reviews on Amazon. But this album deserves it. Being a fan of Alice In Chains ever since I was a kid, I've been anticipating this album since about January. Seeing them live recently made me that much more excited. They have once again, in my opinion knocked it out of the park. There is not a single dull moment on this album for an AIC fan. Old fans love Layne Staley. New fans love William Duvall. Real fans love Alice In Chains. There are several stand-out tracks on this album, and I was pleasantly surprised to hear William Duvall sing lead on the song titled \\"Hung On A Hook\\". It's always great to hear Jerry Cantrell, but hearing William take the lead for once was very refreshing and it should definitely happen more often. Very exciting, though I wish his voice was mixed in just a tad bit louder. As a person who owns the discography, this one's right up there with their best work, and will definitely stay in my CD player for a long time. Bottom line, GET THIS ALBUM.
B00C061I3K|5.0|this is by far one of my most favorite Daft Punk albums. this album is really groovy giving it that 70's or 80's feel. Its actually so groovy my head decided to grow an afro. this album really gets me into that pumped stage and makes me want to roller skate down a 50 foot hill while holding a boom box playing this album. all in all. great album.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Holy battles.  In true Wheel of Time fashion, days last 600 pages, and a million loose ends finally get tied up.  This isn't the end of a fairy tale, however, and some old friends don't make it to the end of the Last Battle...but it is as it should be.  I am sorry to see it go, but it was a well written, slow churning war novel, with the grinding give and take of battles and never know how it will end until at last, it does.  It may not be THE end, but it is AN end.
B008645YEE|5.0|Great music from a great movie.  Listening to the CD evokes scenes from the movie in my mind as I listen.  I often find myself wanting to see the movie again after I listen to this CD.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|...Fun game...cool graphics...wish everything didn't cost so much...Will keep playing and see how the multiplayer function works right now I have no matches
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I guess this is &#34;supposed to be great&#34; because it's a little dark, and a major character dies in it. For me, something was missing. 'hard to put my finger on it..but &#34;Bonds&#34; used to be more fun than serious. A little preposterous is good (but not insanely so like the dreadful Pierce Brosnan episodes.) Perhaps too the first Daniel Craig Bond movie set the action/adventure bar just too high. The opening scene was so spectacular in the first one, that even the rest of the first movie was downhill from there.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|Pros: If you love Hawaiian music, this is as close to authentic as I've heard in a long time.<br />  And if you really liked the movie, you'll certainly enjoy this soundtrack!  It's melodic, realistically Hawaiian and soothing.<br /><br />Cons: I couldn't find any.  Usually a CD has about 2 things you like and 15 you don't? ... for me, this CD exceptionally had<br />  nothing I didn't like.  I can highly recommend it for your &#34;inner islander&#34;.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|The book is interesting and tells of the culture of the Irish in great detail.  The poor of Ireland have had a terrible time.
B003SI3URQ|4.0|One of many Disney's movie I really like<br />one of my top 15 Disney's movie<br />Now in my early 20's this movie never gets old.
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|I got into this book after looking for a new fantasy series and saw it on several lists. One thing that I will know is if you are looking for high fantasy, this has that in spades. It has magic, dragons, assassins, and many factions of different mysterious origin.<br /><br />However, I must note that others have pointed out this is a very complex series which although it feels like a beginning, it also feels as if you are in the middle of a story that has been unfolding for thousands of years. So jumping right in does take a little getting used to as you start to wrap your head around all the different characters and viewpoints. There are also many different ancient factions, unexplained races, and powerful godlike beings called Ascendants that you will have to make note of it as the book unfolds.<br /><br />That being said this is a complete 10 book fantasy series so you know that more will unfold as you continue, and there will be no waiting for that final conclusion.
0060899190|5.0|if you think you have problems or struggle with inner demons read this book and your mind will be swayed
B005OCFGTO|5.0|All the DVD's in one place. Exactly what I wanted and a KILLER deal. I love Harry Potter and was devastated when I lost my first set of DVD's. This was more than a replacement but an upgrade I love that all the DVD's are in one case it's perfect.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I like the part where Amanda reconnects with Dawson, Then she finds out he was shot and her son Jared has Dawson's heart.<br />So she still has a part of Dawson through her son.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved this book ... It makes you reflect and appreciate your life ! Thought provoking, wonderful characters...could not put it down!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I am a total pegasister, I LOVE mlp this is a great game for kids and adults who like mlp. the amount of gems and/or bits you have to pay for a pony is a little over hand , but otherwise it's a great game I recommend it.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I wish that I had not read this book. I was so disappointed I could DIE. I have loved each and every Sookie book. This one however just seemed like Charlaine was just sick of writing about Sookie and wanted to get her out of the way which I am very sad about considering how well she has written each and every other Sookie story. They have always had Heart, Soul and Body. This one had absolutely no heart and no soul at all :( I will not say who Sookie ended up with but I am sorry to say that it is an absolutely ridiculous end to a very Vital Sookie. Two of the very Very VERY Important characters are just shoved by the wayside and your guess is as good as mine of what becomes of them. My favorite all time character is basically a piece of paper smashed up and throw in the garbage! Charlaine I love you but do you really thing this was a good ending to such a wonderful saga? I say NO. If I would have know this was how you were going to end it I may have slapped you at your book signning. :(
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|As usual, this series is spellbinding.  I watch one episode after another.<br />I've watched all six seasons and now in the middle of season 7.  Just<br />hoping it will go on for several more!!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|alright movie and good acting from my man woody..if you haven't seen this yet you probably won't so there ya go
B003G4W49C|2.0|Poor writing and a predictable storyline left me wondering where all the rave reviews I've heard for years came from. Interesting enough not to feel like a waste of time, but nothing beyond that.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|Beautiful classic movie, so glad I bought it to share with my daughter! Everyone should at least watch it once in their life!
0684824906|5.0|Excellent book. After watching the movie, I just had to get more history on Lincoln. this book has fulfilled that

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is great...now I just have to wait for January for the 4th season. There are a lot of twists and turns this season, you will want to watch them all in a row!
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I've watched this movie at least a hundred times. This is when Will Ferrell graduated from being a comedian and became an actor
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Awesome game for my kiddo. Easy to play yet challenging for his mind. I would definitely recommend it for my friends kids!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I would like it more if each puzzle had a solution that did not require a shuffle and I'm not sure the more complex puzzles do.

B0023SDPS6|5.0|Everybody seems like people I know.<br />Craig Johnson creates some good, believable characters in some believable situations. This book is about us and our neighbors. living life.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|I enjoy the story, but find myself hating some of the characters. I know it is the end of the world and all, but every person carries an AK and they are not convincing as a military force. More aliens are needed and less teenage romance.
B009K86D86|5.0|This should be on the top of everybody's watch list! It's very informative, and interesting! I learned new things about our food industry!
B004UPALT6|1.0|It was a 3 way tie for worst acting, plot and writing.  I did like seeing the &#34;sexy&#34; 80 styles fashion again.  Couldn't believe there was actually a sequel made.  Thanks Amazon for including a fast forward.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|Today sees the re-release of Wings Over America, and a more perfect way to waltz into the summer season is hard to imagine. Maybe what I like most about it is the act of the artist actually giving a damn, and supplying fans with value for their money. Paul McCartney has yet to rest upon his laurels - he's still doing lively and long shows to loving throngs, and when he puts out product, it delivers on the promise.<br /><br />Originally released in 1976, Wings Over America sounds as fresh today as it did during the summer of America's bicentennial. That year, the three album set sold over 4 million copies, and landed on top of the Billboard Album Charts - it might not perform quite that well this summer, but it will stand as one of the best packages released in 2013.<br /><br />I recently saw Rockshow, the DVD filmed on the same tour, in a cinema and I was amazed at my response - it was like being 16 again. I was giddy with excitement, and every tune took me back to somewhere both familiar and great. The almost two and a half hour show never sagged, it sailed from beginning to end.<br /><br />McCartney successfully manages to make the argument that he may just be the most well rounded musician to ever grace a stage. His writing is easily equal to any, his singing is inspired and strong throughout, his piano playing is as good as any rock 'n' rollers, his bass playing is rivaled by few in any genre, and while he's always the star, he still manages to share the stage with his band, giving them ample opportunity to shine and when they are busy shining, Paul plays the consummate sideman. If anyone has offered a more complete package, I can't recall it.<br /><br />And what a band. Denny Laine, who supplied a multi-instrumental flair, an excellent voice, and songwriting skills to boot, had been pulled from relative anonymity by McCartney when the ex-Beatle decided to form a band and hit the road. Guitarist Jimmy McCulloch was recruited after Paul, Denny, and Linda had recorded Band On The Run in Lagos, Nigeria, and his fiery lead work is still a wonder to experience - McCulloch succumbed to a heroin overdose in 1979 at the age of just 26, and it's one of rock's strangest ironies that his most remembered performance is singing the anti-drug classic, Medicine Jar on the band's Venus and Mars album, an album nearly performed in whole on this live set. Joe English, an unlikely unknown is a marvel behind the drum kit, and also a fine accompanying vocalist. Rounding out the band is the missus - Paul's Linda, and her performances here are downright charming. Linda and Paul endured great criticism over her presence on the stage, but the result is still a remarkable live album and film, so damn the critics. The band is superb, they are given great latitude to display their talents, and they deliver in spades.<br /><br />Paul McCartney's performance is a wonder to behold - he makes it look so easy that one has to step back, watch, listen, then realize that what you have before you is truly a musical god. His skillset is indeed hard to match, and he has a great time displaying them. If anyone at these shows had more fun, it would be a surprise.<br /><br />As remasters go, this one is a huge success - McCartney's voice is captured in crisp high fidelity, as is the entire show. The guitars are punchy and vibrant - McCulloch is forever documented as an amazingly sharp soloist, and Laine's inventive versatility is highlighted as he maneuvers from double neck electric to bass to acoustic guitar, and piano. Maybe the coolest feature of the remastering process is the sound of McCartney's Rickenbacker bass. Sitting comfortably in the front of the mix, it becomes apparent that Paul is quite deserving when referred to by many as rock's best bassist. The separation is succinct, and the rich tone-fulness of every instrument is superb throughout. This should be textbook material for anyone who will ever mix a live record - it gets little better than this.<br /><br />There's no need for me to go into individual song performances, but I will mention that the Wings material has aged very well, and stands next to The Beatles classics quite well. There's no time in which the set sags - it starts on a high and remains there for the duration. Whether you were one of the original millions who owned Wings Over America, or  not, this remastered re-release is a winner. The remaster does sound better than the original CD release, and its crisp, in-your-face mix will have you smiling from ear to ear all summer long.<br /><br />Hats off to Mr. McCartney for showing that he still cares  - in a day and age when the competition for the entertainment dollar is at an all time high, the cute Beatle remains a stellar bargain.<br /><br />Special mention to the late Jimmy McColluch - this set reminds me what a gifted and special guitarist the young Scot was, and what the world lost with his passing. His playing here is phenomenal - the notes, the tones, his phrasing are all essential rock listening.<br /><br />Rock Guitar Daily with Tony Conley
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great period piece. Shows behind the scenes of class and national distinctions with history applications of war, high drama and intrigue.
1400069807|5.0|I am currently on a doctor-monitored weight loss plan that restricts fats, sugars and carbohydrates almost completely.  It consists mainly of meats and vegetables, and forbids the ingestion of just about every processed food in the grocery aisles.  The philosophy is that processed food is what causes obesity and, as a consequence, diabetes, kidney problems, fatty liver, heart disease, etc. etc.  After 6 weeks on this diet, I have lost over 10% of my body weight and reduced my body mass from obese to nearly normal.<br /><br />I mention this as a prelude to my impressions about this book.  It is spot-on with its indictment of the processed food industry as the cause of obesity in this country.  According to my doctor, there are two sections of the grocery store (meats and vegetables) that are worth shopping in.  The remainder of the store, with few exceptions, is dangerous to our health!  Between designing the fat/sugar/salt content to addict the consumer's taste (or \\"bliss point\\"), and the deceptive marketing tactics use to obfuscate the true nutritional contents, we have lost control of what we eat and what we want to eat.  The fast foods available to the public, not just through restaurant outlets, but ready-prepared foods in every aisle, are designed to entice our purchase, and return purchases.  We are no longer preparing food from \\"scratch\\".  It is far easier to pour a bowl of cereal than to cook up a breakfast of bacon and eggs (bacon and eggs are no longer \\"evil\\" while cereal is fortified with sugar, carbs, fats and salt so that it tastes good).  In the past decades we have forgotten how to cook, or have succumbed to preparing pre-packaged convenience foods designed more to outsell competing brands than to deliver a healthy diet.  PLEASE READ THIS BOOK!
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|As a fan for many years, this album is amazing.Its's a great balance of alt metal,melodic in your face vocal harmonies and great acoustics.<br />I mean wow, I heard the single \\"Hollow\\" I couldn't wait for more.<br />When I traveled to Charlotte,N.C to see them live at the Carolina Rebellion, WOW, i felt like it was the 90's with such an amazing crowd and killer performance.<br />But enough of me ranting about them live.<br />The new album is a must for AIC fans!<br />Layne would be proud of the new material!<br />And for the record, yes, he is dead and everywhere I go , I see \\"AIC is dead etc etc without Layne\\" is baffling.<br />As fans, I think we should at-least appreciate them coming out and blessing our ears with great music.<br />And William Duvall rocks as a front man and lyricist and such a down to earth person :)<br />All tracks are great but here are some notable ones where as you listen to each time, the energy within your brain craves more and more:<br />LAB MONKEY(watch out for that ear melting chorus\\"Had enough,I don't need you to stick my Hyde,Had enough,no more tears left for me to cry...\\"<br />THE DEVIL PUT DINO\\"S HERE(\\"the dev put dinos here,Jesus dont like a quuer,the dev put dinos here,no problem with faith,just fear\\")<br />PRETTY DONE<br />SCALPEL<br />PHANTOM LIMB(very dark with some killer riffs and backing harmonies)_
0956031609|5.0|I read this novel by Shamim Sarif in one sitting!  Simply put, I was transported into the depths of the story.  What an enriching story, and an enlightening story, told during an era of apartheid in South Africa.  To imagine and visualise a blossoming romance between two women at such an unforgiving time.  Beautiful and refreshing.  Just love it!!
B005LW5J9O|5.0|This book is the best explanation of the transition from the oppressive religious atmosphere of the medieval church  to the  Renaissance. It is history written by a master writer and teacher. It reads like a novel.  Highly recommended.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Wish the book had not ended so abruptly..... But maybe there was really nothing more to say. I will check other books by this author.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Couldn't put it down and enjoyed the brilliant way Orson made me see through the eyes of the adults and the kids.
1616550414|5.0|It's everything a Zelda fan could want. It is very based on skyward sword, but the other games are also representet. And it's the official timeline!<br /><br />It has tons of game art, and development prosesses. Must have for Zelda fans.
B009EQG80W|5.0|Self-evident, timeless truths well expressed. The psychiatrist's viewpoint was very interesting, even though I'm not convinced about everything he writes. Leaves room for the reader.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|After a few days of playing, so far is so good! Great graphics, gameplay's slow but not too slow. Recommended for any fan of the movie

B00003CXA6|5.0|My family and I traveled to Gettysburg after we watched this movie.  It brought it all full circle.  Jeff Daniels had so much passion in his role, I had to research his character more and more after seeing Penn.

B003VDY7XE|5.0|While some of the mysteries of the week are familiar to fans of other sci-fi/fantasy shows, the characters are fresh, the script is smart, and the show manages to genuinely surprise me. Not easy for someone who's seen every ep of Supernatural, Star Trek (all series), BSG, Buffy, DW, etc.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Captivating story, with interesting characters. This is definitely worth reading! The characters stay with you. This kept me &#34;turning pages&#34; far into the nights.

B008BU75IQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book but expected it to conclude this series.  It is not a<br />Trilogy. It is  a satisfying adventure.  How many more books do we expect?
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book was a fun ride from beginning to end. It was fun to relive my 80's upbringing with all of the pop culture references. The writing was excellent and the plot kept me staying up late to find out what would happen to my new fellow geek friends. I wish there was a sequel!
B0060D08JO|5.0|Great Movie! Must watch especially if you're a &#34;techie&#34; :P  Check it out... This is definitely a movie for the ages.
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|I ordered this DVD because I've always wanted to see Ringo Starr and his All-Starr Band, regardless of which version was on tour.  Most of the reviews were good, a couple were so-so and one was really bad, but I bought it anyway.  I love this concert at the Ryman.  One of the reviews said that the band members were just &#34;going thru the motions&#34;.  I couldn't disagree more.  I think the sound quality is terrific, the band, in my opinion, seems to really go after it hard.  It's obvious they're having fun, and the crowd was on fire.  If I had one complaint, it would be that Ringo didn't do &#34;You're sixteen&#34;, but he had a new CD to plug and did a couple songs from that.  One I though was pretty good, one I wasn't nuts about.  I love this concert and watched it again this weekend.  Loved Todd Rungren, Greg Rolie from Santana, Steve Lukather of Toto, Richard Page of Mister Mister, Mark Rivera, the sax player & percussionist, Greg Bissonette and Richard Page, the drummer and bass player, they were all terrific.  If you like Ringo, you'll love this DVD.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I found the movie interesting, and thought I might enjoy a more detailed story.  I have and the book goes more into Pat's mental illness.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|My grandchildren and their friends love the movie and so do we!  What a riot!  Great fun for the family to sit down together and enjoy a family movie with warmth and good values.
0316010669|5.0|Awesome book, really makes you think, uses fantastic examples, didn't want to put it down.  I'd suggest it to anyone!
0786670665|5.0|This book is great and has many tricks that Tommy uses. Many different things to practice in this book. Just remember buying and storing it on your bookself it won't make you play like him, though.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|very good show I liked the action and the new stars are good in their parts,,,Amazon did a great job having this on here
B000000OU0|5.0|I had forgotten how much I love their music.  This album has my old favorites plus some of their newer songs which I am also enjoying.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really good very hard to get characters tho its fast past and quit fun when you get the hang of it been playin this for a while on my kindle and whwat makes it even better is that its free yuuuuhhhhh!!!! :)
B009R659L8|5.0|I can't wait till a new book of hers comes out because I know it will be great and this one didn't disappoint.  Would definitely recommend to anyone who is a fan of hers and anyone else who has never read her books.
B004XISI4A|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and the rest in the series. The only downside was skipping from one storyline to the other although it did make me keep reading, trying to read the next part of each characters trials and triumphs. I am waiting eagerly for the next installment.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I LOVE this move and others by Hayao Miyazaki.  I am thrilled to add this to my collection.  I can't wait to get more of them.
B006C5FWH8|4.0|I have been enjoying this game for some time  Pretty good for a turn based 40k clone. Missions get a little repetitive with your foe but it seems the dev are making changes as things go. Only thing I'd like to see is to know whatever of missions my squad has done maybe I misses it.  Grenades would be nice enhancement.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Such a fantastic well written book. It keeps you on your toes throughout the book.  I could not stop reading it, its so addicting.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have enjoyed this mini series.  Can't wait to see the next episode.  The setting, plot and characters are all to be applauded.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|These battery's were delivered promptly, we're fully charged and reasonably priced.  I use these battery's  for wireless sensor night lights.
1609611543|5.0|Very informative it changed my eating habits and I lost weight, it also helped my granddaughter's asthma. My daughter-in-law also lost weight with out even exercising.
B007SGM084|5.0|Get ready to be up all night. This book is addicting. I absolutely loved it. It's a must read for every woman.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|There could have been a little more to the ending.  It was not a surprise, but it kind of trailed off without much fun.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|Definitly a guilty pleasure movie. Good mindless fun.  This would be a great one to watch with the girlfriends and have some wine. Lot's of fun with a few cringe worthy moments. Overall , a good distraction.
0446619078|5.0|Harry Bosh, Michael Connelly's fictional detective who has become quite famous, takes on another of the thrilling cases that are always assigned to him.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I did a little book club kind of thing with my 13 year old son and we picked this series.  It was really fun for us.  Great book and age appropriate for him and really fun for me to read as well.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|The game was amazing. The graphics were freaking mindblowing for a kindle game 720p 60hz. Multiplayer was excellent and by far better than the previous modern combats. The campaign was breath taking and amazing. One of the best kindle fire/kindle apps avaiable 5/5
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|This movie had me in a funk for days after I saw it.  A few casting choices of people who have no business in a musical keep it from five stars though.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Just a brilliant piece of music. I don't know what some people are complaining about. What more do you want? Layne is gone folks. He was a very special talent and is sorely missed, but the band has moved on and you should too. This is still very much Alice in Chains. It is a continuation of BGWTB, but is superior to that album in every way, shape and form. Traces of earlier albums can be found oozing out of every song and there are no duds, IMHO. And give William DuVall some credit. He's a terrific singer in his own right, and the impossibly rich vocal harmonies he and Cantrell create are incredibly haunting, almost channeling Layne's spirit at times. If you're an old-school AIC fan who is still skeptical, TDPDH should put all doubts to rest. Alice in Chains is alive and well, kicking and screaming.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I did a little book club kind of thing with my 13 year old son and we picked this series.  It was really fun for us.  Great book and age appropriate for him and really fun for me to read as well.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I now understand why this book has been on the best seller list all these weeks.  It is completely compelling, you have to keep reading. \\"Gone Girl\\" is a story that if you love books that keep you riveted and a little bit scared, this is for you.  I'm now going to order the other two books and if they are only half as good, I will still love them.  Mary Coates
B004J4WN0I|5.0|This series is so impressive that I bought this whole book, even though I'd already had the paperback, just for the short stories.<br /><br />I read this whole series back-to-back-to-back.  I can't even honestly say I remember which book contains which events.  The story is written with so much overlapping action that there is no good stopping place between reading sessions, not even between books!  The quips stay sharp and the action sequences never slow down.
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|I am not happy.  Great remake, but I was expecting an Unrated cut for blu-ray.  If the studio thinks they are double-dipping off me, think again.  I'm waiting on the Hobbit (extended cuts already confirmed) and I'm waiting on this too.  Stop being so damn greedy Hollywood!
B00B89WXYS|5.0|Every time i listen to this cd i think i have a favorite song and then i listen again and i have another one... Basically this cd is amazing each and every song!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazon On Demand videos are the highest quality of anything I've found - I'd recommend them to anyone; high quality, no skipping or freezing, and available when you need them!
B000ICXQU6|5.0|Juia played this one well.  True to life, yet not boring; the actors helped bring the plight of this town to life.  I loved the acting and loved the show.
B00BI745AA|5.0|Music is fantastic. A little too much close ups, but the overall effect is great. I enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />Ulrich Sander
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We (my family and I) have thoroughly enjoyed the first two seasons and are eagerly awaiting the 3rd season which we hope will be available soon.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|absolutely love this show. so sad that the season ended and can't wait for next season to start in the fall.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack Reacher never disappoints! Fast and entertaining read. I  have read all the Reacher books. Great action writing every time!
159315724X|5.0|Darren Hardy hit the mark on this book for sure.  I've read it a few times plus I've gifted it to others.  This is a must-read.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I think this was an amazing first book and intriguingly peculiar story. No need for me to outline the plot as many reviewers have already nicely described it.  I appreciated the author's descriptive writing style that took me on the adventure and into the setting. I thought the author's inspiration for writing this book was unique and I can't wait until the sequel is unveiled.
0679809015|2.0|We were very disappointed in this book.  The pictures are clear but the flaps are very thin and flimsy and more paper like which means that young children (a) struggle to manipulate them and (b) they tear and warp very easily
B000JMKTLO|1.0|So disappointed after reading &#34;Gone Girl&#34; first.  Thought it would be good.  Extremely creepy.  One book I'm sorry I read.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it on my phone, computer and my kindle and it saves it all. Great for sharing projects of all kinds it fits exactly what I need. I can work on something on my kindle then go to work on it on my computer and pick up right where I left off. I love it.
B00CVCG87O|5.0|The instrumentation from their debut CD \\"One\\" is intact. The changes in dynamics, lush atmospheres, syncopated rhythms and pristine production are all included.  New singer Ashe O'Hara has wonderful vocal delivery and his layered harmonies are engaging and really cause you to hit \\"play\\" right away when the music ends.<br /><br />Tesseract has had a few bumps in the road over the last few years but \\"Altered States\\" proves that through tribulations a strong group can become stronger.<br /><br />Chances are that if you are reading this you already know and enjoy Tesseract.  If you are on the fence about it, take my word for it: this is a sure-thing.  It will be your medicine today.<br /><br />Now, if they would please come to USA to perform live, that would be great.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Life of Pi was a good book.  Though it started out slow, it quickly captured my attention and had me so interested that I couldn't put it down.
B00CRMWMZ0|4.0|I love this album!  Very retro meets future music.  My favorite tracks are Get Lucky and Doin' it Right.  Daft Punk doesn't falter!!
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|This film had alot of twists and turns and Jude Law was great in it.  I'm not a big Catherine Zeta-Jones fan<br />but she was perfect for this role.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Acting by everyone involved was excellent and the story itself was riviting.  Serious, entertaining and educational all in one and all will love it
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is the best game that I have ever played. I saw it one day, and figured I'd buy it and give it a try. We instantly became addicted to it.  What you do is you're settling a newly discovered island and you have to build various things like settlements, cities, and roads.  Sound boring?  Think again.  It is by far the funnest board game I have ever played.  Also, I would definitely recommend the expansions. They add tons of fun to the game.  You might also want the 5-6 player extensions if you play games with that many people. All of that can get expensive after a while, but it is definitely worth it!  Out of five stars, I give Catan 25
B000KIRT6A|4.0|for the price it is nice. Only downside is no center stops to 'feel' so you have to be careful adjusting in a hurry or in the dark.
B00CLO3G54|5.0|very good movie, excellent acting.  i especially enjoy the two performances by the &#34;choir&#34;,  it is a very good choice for when you feel a little out of sorts or sad.  very uplifting!!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Like: Light-weight, simple, and compact.<br />Dislike: The stand is a little more complicated to get right than I thought it would be, but nothing major.<br /><br />Overall, this product was exactly what I was looking for. Just a simple cover for my Kindle that wouldn't get in the way of me using it. I like the simple design and I am happy with the color I chose (The gray with a black band).
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Great mix of musical style, tempos and trided and true JT music we have all come to love. A great buy!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book always had surprises and action to keep the reader interested, great book for readers who enjoy action and love stories.
B00BSBVLF8|3.0|We did not watch it all the way through, some might like it but it just wasn't what we expected or were looking for. The dynamics of the show, really didn't translate to the movie we felt.
0345529057|5.0|I read all of these a couple of years ago but when I watch the episodes on HBO, I get completely lost so I bought the complete set to re-read.  I have also have the last one 'Dragons.......&#34; which I haven't read as yet.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I started getting a little tired of the same wording. I was hoping for more. It's kind of like more of the same. Don't get me wrong. It's still a &#34;suck you in&#34; kind of read. Maybe if you really space them out between reads you'll forget that stuff. Otherwise, this whole trilogy is delicious. I wouldn't throw it away and I would probably read it again in the future. ;-D
B002VHI8J0|2.0|I found it very hard to get into this book. Just when I had got into it the story changed and I had to try to get into a new character and different time all over again - several times. I found it irritating.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This was a wonderfully written story. Absolutely fell in love with the characters and couldn't stop reading. This book really illustrates some of the processes one goes through when facing a terminal illness and the attitude choices one has. I definitely recommend this to any one.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|The game play is okay, for the most part. My problem is that the game always has a problem connecting to other ponies (I play on a kindle fire), so I can never get the heart gems. Fix that, and the game would probably rate four star.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have been surprised at all the different types of people that have read this series of books. Age, race, religion, background, upbringing...whatever. And now I understand why. This first book was very exciting to read. There were a couple of &#34;oops&#34; parts that distracted me. But that was VERY temporary. HAHA! It's definitely a trip to hear what people think of this book when you ask them &#34;So, how was it?&#34; LOL
B007T7MIR0|3.0|Does not open doc files.  Will uninstall and seek and find free viewer that does.  Ok for free app, I guesss.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|You guys should add more presets for the sounds (like studying, sleeping, and many more)<br />Or make the presets downloadable so that user have more of a customizable experience.<br />(please consider making these changes/adding the options)<br />This app is so useful, Thanks Ipnos Software!
B0059A149C|2.0|Very poor picture quality. Too many military inacuracies to count. No closed captioning. Too bad, it was a good subject.
B0079LJZG8|4.0|Unlike so many &#34;spy&#34; movies, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy features none of the car chases, gun battles, or naked women that have become stock-in-trade for the genre. Instead, you'll be treated to the intellectual side of things as George Smiley unravels the layers hidden within his own &#34;Circus&#34; as the British Intelligence agency is affectionately known. There's a mole, a double agent in the highest ranks and &#34;Control&#34; the head of the Circus is forced out after an operation goes horribly wrong. Although Smiley is sent packing with Control, he is soon recalled to find the mole by some worrying politicians. Smiley gets to pick his team, which consists of some reliable people, all well-played, and all willing to make the sacrifices necessary to get the job done. Smiley himself is a flawed individual, one willing to tolerate his wife's infidelity, his nation's scorn, his fellow spy-master's diatribes with hardly a ruffled feather. Smiley is brilliantly played by Gary Oldman. Oldman truly is incredible in this role, living up to my expectations developed from reading LeCarre's book of the same title. The movie stays as consistent as possible to the book, serving up the tedium of real spy work in huge stretches. No, this is not a James Bond thriller, but a rather a careful look at human frailty writ through the reality of the cold war. Enjoy this movie several times and keep it on the shelf.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|It is fun. It is fun to try to beat your score. I just like this kind of game. Maybe it's not for everyone.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Functions well, easily cleanable. Does need to be lint brushed on the fuzzy side once in awhile since it picks up lint, dust, and so on.
B0095P341S|5.0|We loved how they integrated (spoiler alert!).....  the Avengers.  I had no idea that they were going to appear.  Disney has really made the heroes come back to life and Robert Downing Jr. is perfect for this role.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|Good film, great actors, too many predictable plot devices. Loved the setting, though it's a cleaned up view of India.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Highly addictive. I love to see all of the categories and items that people pin. I love the art, DIY, and humor pins.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love all three of these books, I am sad that I have read them all and now I find myself wanting more of the fifty shades and more of Christian. These books are so hot...
1416550550|5.0|This is the first book i've read by this writer and i love her style and plot lines.  I am already dreading the story ending and will order more of her books!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|So many characters and so many threads in the story all woven together so well. I'm looking forward to the next book,
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a long time. I was extremely sad to finish it. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone. It is a true romance.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|The fighting scene in the open field was the best part of the whole movie! The Bella-Jacob kissing scene was the second best part! If you are a action/fight movie lover, this movie will most likely satisfy you.
B00BQ1D9IW|5.0|Great release from an extremely talented band.<br /><br />The song writing is what excels here. This is not metal in the modern sense but more of a late 70's style hard rock. Easily one of, if not THE best release of the year.<br /><br />Ghost brings a refreshing change to what has become a stagnant pool of noise metal.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Can't wait to get the rest the seasons! Love this show!  My husband even laughs when he sits long enough to see a few minutes with me.
1936594234|3.0|Parts of it were excellent, but parts I had trouble relating to my Christian beliefs.  Condition of the book on arrival was excellent.
B00A2DIW3C|5.0|Fascinating, funny, and informative reading.<br /><br />Having worked at Edwards Air Force Base in 1952 when the  X-1 was being tested,<br />I like reading about flight related subjects.<br /><br /> Patricia Conley
1421550644|5.0|Item arrived in perfect condition. This box set is an amazing deal for the amount of content! Less than half the price of the individual trade paperbacks combined, in a beautiful hardcover set in slipcase. Was out of print for a good 4-5 months from the original release back in November 2012, was finally available again recently, so I pounced on it. You should, too.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Love it!!!  Can not wait to get all the seasons that are out. This is funny, entertaining, and enjoyable. A little different twist to what has been on for crime fighting.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Awesome album! The song w/Julian Casablanca's is the s***! I was contemplating the purchase but it was well worth it.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|I chose the rating because it was a good book. I disliked nothing. I would recommend the book to a young adult.
B00B5A9FLY|4.0|I like this series very much.  It is full of adventure but is not gory.  It is definitely something the whole family could watch and it takes us back to the days of King Arthur and the knights.  It was great seeing Merlin when he was a novice magician and how he grew into his greater powers.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|A fun album with a lot of great tunes. Better listened to in order rather than shuffling around. Good times.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Ever since Purple Hibiscus, I have eagerly awaited the writer's novels. Half Of A Yellow Sun was my favorite. Was. This is like drinking cold tart lime juice that perfectly quenches your thirst... Sharp, smart, real.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I movies that conceptualizes unlimited possibilities. It was inspiring. I enjoyed the idea that we are connected through time. Loved it
B009AMAGQM|2.0|It IS possible to adapt a book to a movie. I've seen it done countless times with good to excellent results. This, however, is not an adaptation in my opinion. It's nothing but a terribly hacked version of the Beautiful Creatures story.<br /><br />Necessary characters were completely deleted or - just as bad - two characters melded into one. Characteristics of the characters were changed. Dagnabbit! Ridley didn't even have a single lollipop! Entire sections of plot were completely changed. Mainly - and with the most consequences for potential movie sequels, I believe- the ending!<br /><br />The reason I've given this two stars instead of just one... The actors and the locations. I think the actors did an excellent job, especially considering the pathetic script they had to work from. The outdoor locations were fantastic. Very much like you find here in the Charleston, SC area.<br /><br />I do think the indoor sets for Ravenwood could have been done much better. Simply changing the color of the entry/living room and strewing a few fall leaves around DOES NOT convey house's ability to change in order to emphasize an event or emotion. Would at least a carpet runner and banister been too much to ask for?<br /><br />So, if you haven't read the books, you might like the film.<br /><br />If you have read the books, you'll most likely hate the movie. Either don't waste your time/money, OR take it for what it is.....a basic plot concept (poorly) written by someone else.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A fun, entertaining mystery read with opportunities to change your mind several times.  It's all about control with a good bit of mental health insight
B00785P2QC|3.0|Too many times I have to post to Facebook or buy more points to complete a mission. Interesting concept though.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|FreeCell+ is a super Solitaire game... I've been playing a computer version for years. Learned new moves with this one.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like it very much.  It is much easier to use than my phone,  although I don't calculate much anymore.
B00BHNR1KQ|3.0|Not bad if there is nothing else to watch. I don't remember much but what I do remember was that it was an ok movie
B009AMANBA|2.0|Unfortunately I thought I was buying the book, so I was very disappointed when  I opened the package. To date I cannot rate it as I have not used it.
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|an excellent addition to my William Boyd library, when the author writes of one of the characters trimming her lawn with edging clippers. Very well written thriller and only whets my reading appetite for more work by Boyd!
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Movie was okay, which is the reason for three stars.  The Amazon digital download, accessed via Roku, froze twice, and would not unfreeze.  The first time we had to stop watching the movie and return the next day.  The second time, the freeze was only for a few minutes.  But this is the second movie we've rented and had these problems.  It seems to me that Amazon digital movies still need improvement if they want to compete with Netflix.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|I always loved uno when I was a kid. I was happy when I saw this app. Its actually pretty fun to play, even though its not the same as playing a real human being. I recommend it!
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|From all the low reviews I was expecting this to be awful, but this was a pretty good movie. Good acting, decent story line, some cool special effects, what's not to like.
B0036S4C6G|2.0|Half way through, have had a difficult time feeling anything for the characters.  Seems frivolous, just not my kind of book.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|This is the easiest way to lose weight.  no counting points, weighing portions, or measuring.  All you do is fast two days a week.  You don't really fast in the traditional sense.  You cut back on your calories - women 500, men 600.  That's it. The author says you should lose about 1 pound a week.  I have lost 12 in a little over 5 weeks now and it's soooo easy.  There are recipes in the last chapter, but it's easy to get your food from the grocery store.  I eat the prepared breakfast sandwiches that are &#34;lightened up&#34; with egg whites and turkey sausage.  The other days of the week I eat what I would normally eat.  While I thought I would be famished the day after fasting that's just not the case.  In fact, I find myself eating less, especially the &#34;fatty&#34; foods like cake and ice cream - I just don't have the desire to eat them.  Of course your results may vary but why not give it a try.  The only thing you have to lose is weight!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I got this game and was instantly addicted. For whatever reason, when I play this I keep finding myself saying &#34;one more and I'll go to bed.&#34; There are fun power-ups in this game that help you get more bingos. Its also fun to actually play against other users and not just a computer. Also, you get more coins each day if you claim them, so no need to buy them.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Short but entertaining, this game gives a great balance by presenting fairly challenging puzzles and , at the same time, providing just the right amount of hints.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|The crazy high punching combos really get you addicted to this one.<br /><br />Simple controls, but so much depth in the timing of the execution of all the punches.<br /><br />Loving the RPG-based graphics and the special eggs - rainbow goat is the best!<br /><br />Recommend to everyone loving crazy fighting combo making and fast and furious punching games.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|The acting was ok but - The movie was dark and blurry. I had been excited to see this but was disappointed in it.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|handy to have ready at any time that I might want to get a math problem solved in due time.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Great background on one of the greatest songwriting, vocal groups of all time. This video proves that even though this band went thru many key personnel changes, their music and vocal integrity has not only lasted thru four decades, but their popularity has gotten bigger. It's hard to think that they are touring again, I just wish I could afford to see them once more in concert. I'm pretty sure that this will be their absolute last tour, and it will be sad to see them retire once and for all. They will leave a big hole in the music industry that will be very hard to fill.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I hate face book, why should i have to sign up to play this dumb game. I hate face book.
0062119044|5.0|This novel astonished me.  It was a slow read at first, a little mundane with the occasional shocker.  Beautifully written and honest, it is the story of a woman who bears a child that she really didn't want, and who didn't want her either.  It is raw and heartbreaking.  The ending is surprising and devastating.  I would absolutely recommend this novel.
B00A757EFW|4.0|brings back memories of when we played that game with our grandchildren so many years ago before many of the tablets that we now use.
B001HBWY8M|5.0|This was really a cute movie, clean and refreshing, and something the whole family can watch together.  Although the ending was predictable, I didn't mind at all because it ended just the way you hoped it would!  Loved it.
1476712042|5.0|I absolutely loved my book, and it easily has become one of my favorite. It was impossible out down as the story was always taking twists and turns. At times the plot seemed a little unrealistic, but the whole thing was great besides that. I always valued the way Jamie McGuire chose to not describe the characters so you were forced to imagine your own, even if that did get a little frustrating. The whole thing was truly beautiful though, on top of exceptional and every other word with a similar meaning to \\"great\\".

B009H7SCMA|5.0|Gabriella by Alan Hardy is fast-paced, contemporary and fully modern - yet still totally classic - Vaudeville burlesque, replete with Benny Hill type brazen, in-your-face, no-holds-barred raunchy humor (or should I say humour).  It does, however, still have its fair share of unexpected twists and turns -- a couple of which caught me completely off-guard.<br /><br />The setting at a cricket match is fantastic.  The characters are so gauche and depraved in their actions, it's only logical that they would carry these actions out in front of a full compliment of spectators, many of whom are equally crude.  There, and of course around a poor old chestnut tree that must sit in a mudhole from all the bodily fluids that surely seep into the ground at its base.<br /><br />The insulting mockery of royals -- and the equally insulting ridicule of commoners -- gives the impression that it must be one very fine line indeed that Mr. Hardy straddles.<br /><br />Even for Americans who may not understand the game of cricket, the raunchy humor -- much of which is done by metaphor during the cricket match -- is still crystal clear.
0743289692|5.0|This is an exceptionally gripping story. It is also an important education for anyone who thinks that Islam is just another religion, morally equivalent to others.
1452105111|4.0|Great quality; Sturdy enough to be re-used for multiple parties in future. Didn't care for ribbon, so used narrow satin ribbon in 3 diff colors (a diff 1 for ea row of &#34;text&#34;). Wished there were a couple more animals from ea book, as this was for a &#34;Brown Bear&#34; 1st birthday party, and only a couple were Brown Bear animals, but I knew that when ordered.
0345409671|5.0|For me this is the best of any of the Vampire Chronicle's that I have read so far (I'm up to Armand the Vampire). This book should replace the bible I'd love to explain why in this review but I don't wanna spoil the book for you. Enjoy!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Used this app today during my morning Bible reading, meditation, and time of prayer. Using the meditation setting and customizing the sounds made it far easier to focus, even with a noisy 2 year old watching cartoons.
B00CRW2066|5.0|Just awesome. It is highly recommended that you buy this record. If you've ever liked any of their other work, I see no reason why you wouldn't like this one as well.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a great game with really challenging and creative puzzles. I just can't wait for the next one to come out. You guys are strip mining my free time away...but in .a good way yknow.
159463176X|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Hosseini's other books. I pre-ordered this one the second they announced it would be published, and timed the finish of my previous book to ensure I could start reading it the moment the package arrived.  This novel centers on the story of siblings Pari and Abdullah, born in Afghanistan, which I found hugely compelling.  I only wish the entire 400 pages had been devoted to them.  Instead, the book contains lengthy sections (some 75+ pages) describing the entire lives of what I feel like should have been minor characters: a Greek surgeon now living in one of the houses Pari lived in as a child, a child now living at the site of the family's original dwelling in Shadbagh, a childhood neighbor of Pari now a doctor living in California.  Each of these stories could (and, in my opinion, should) have been a book of its own.  However, formatted as it was as an \\"aside\\" to Pari's and Abdullah's tale, it was hard for me to \\"get into\\" these other characters.  For instance, I found myself checking how many pages I would have to read about the Greek surgeon before Hosseini would return to Afghanistan and Pari/Abdullah.<br /><br />The book made me realize that for me, Hosseini's most powerful strength is in bringing Afghanistan alive for those who will never be able to freely experience it.  I find his writings about Afghanistan to be some of the best modern literature I have encountered. (His two previous novels would earn a solid five stars from me). I don't think he does AS amazing of a job when writing about Greece or America. However, his storytelling ability is truly unsurpassed, and I will continue to eagerly await each book that he publishes.

B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this App. I love Pinterest and when I'm bored now I can just use my phone. the only thing I haven't figured out is how to &#34;pin&#34; from my phone correctly.

B00753MBHA|3.0|I may be alone here but I got such an old school metal vibe here...not a bad thing mind you but I'll need to run thru it another time or two to maybe bump it up in the rotation. Not saying I don't like it but my ears weren't quite ready for an older sound if you know what I mean.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Just listen, you won't be sorry you did!  A great choice of songs - if not always the artists I would've have picked to sign them.

B000N3ST9I|4.0|A Farewell to Arms is one of the greatest build up to chaos songs ever! See my review of Locust for the same feelings on this CD.
B00847KFDS|4.0|As a long time Fogerty/CCR fan, I was pleasantly surprised by this album. If you're expecting to hear Fogerty, singing his classic CCR hits, in the exact same arrangement as the originals, but with guest artists; that's not what this is and, if you're a purist, who's going to be offended by anyone other than John singing these songs, just don't listen. Obviously, his voice isn't as strong as it was 30 or 40 years ago, particularly on the high notes. But, for a 68 year old rocker, he sounds pretty damn good. I think fans should appreciate that, after all his years in the business, the guy still has the creative desire, and the guts, to put a new spin on some of the greatest rock hits of all time. He's done a great job tailoring the arrangements to the talents of his guest artists, and he didn't just stick with CCR's greatest hits. The standout tracks for me are, \\"Bad Moon Rising\\", with Zac Brown, and the Zydeco/R&B/New Orleans flavored \\"Proud Mary\\", with Jennifer Hudson and Allen Toussaint. A couple of personal favorites are, \\"Who'll Stop the Rain\\", with Bob Seger, and \\"Have You Ever Seen the Rain\\", with Alan Jackson. Seger and Fogerty are my two favorite rock artists and I never imagined I'd hear them doing a duet, and Jackson just does what he does and sounds great. The rest of it is nothing magical, but it's a pretty good listen. Overall, I didn't find anything to dislike, which is surprising because there wasn't much I did like about the Blue Ridge Rangers sequel he did a couple of years ago. If you're a John Fogerty fan, with an open mind, I highly recommend it!

B00CW665VI|5.0|I don't normally leave reviews unless I absolutely love or hate a book...and this book I ABSOLUTELY loved! There were so many times I caught myself laughing out loud because of Drew's inner monologue.  I really hope the author continues to write more books from the male characters POV.

B00CDT41RY|1.0|I was hoping for a bit of history but what this movie is all about is inflaming hatred.  There were gross historical inaccuracies, scenes that didn't match the story location, and travel time lines that would have required jet travel.  This is Hollywood rubbish at its very worst, designed to titillate, anger, and appeal to blood thirst.  There was no redeeming educational or entertainment value.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I personally do not use it.  My 5 year old wanted to get it on her tablet after she played it on her cousins phone and this is the only game she is interested in playing ever since.  Be careful though, because it is very addictive.  I can tell because my 3 year old can't stop playing it.

B00CLH1PHM|5.0|I'm not a short story person, but as a fan of Duncan Whitehead's THE GORDONSTON LADIES DOG WALKING CLUB, I felt I should give this a try. Like the best theatre, this short story is tragedy and comedy. Irony. A very amusing story if you HAVE read TGLDWC (which I highly recommend, by the way). Regardless of your having read the novel which is referenced, this is an excellent short story.<br /><br />Mr. Whitehead weaves a darkly lit tale, riddled with wit and introspection, which makes you mourn yet celebrate. Like GORDONSTON, the characters have their share of flaws, are wonderfully human and real, and sometimes too close for comfort. What makes one man a success, another just so close? In real estate, it's location. In comedy, it's timing. In life, the variables are too many to calculate. Before you finish entering the digits, someone else has pressed \\"enter\\".<br /><br />A sad but satisfying tale and I confess I laughed out loud at a few throwaway lines and literary/filmic references.<br /><br />It's not how you begin the race, but how you finish it. A triumphant finish, but not without its mourning, melancholia, and missed opportunities.<br /><br />Those who loved Gordonston should pick this up. Those who haven't, well, read both.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I bought this autobiography based solely on how many positive reviews it had.  I had no previous knowledge of who Chris Kyle was or what his story was about.  Once started, I was mesmerized by Kyle's tale.  I couldn't put the book down and finished it over a two day period.  As I read the final chapter, it finally dawned on me that this was the young patriot, murdered in March 2013 by a marine with PTSD whom he was trying to help.  Fabulous book.  True American hero.  Tragic, untimely death.
B003JQLHY0|5.0|This is very much like the one I had for over 12 years. It was a quartz model and I really liked it. When I broke my previous watch I checked Amazon and found one very much like it.  So far I am very pleased. Hopefully this model will last as long as my 1st one.

0307887898|5.0|A number of websites recommended The Lean Startup and I finally decided to follow their recommendations and read it. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Eric Ries provides a map on starting a business with concrete steps and strategies for executing a plan. He gives guidance on how and when to persevere with the initial plan or to &#34;pivot&#34; into another approach based on the results, or lack of results, arising from an entrepreneur's initial plan. Entrepreneurs need to learn what their market wants and to provide this and not some product or service that the entrepreneur thinks that the market should want or need. To do this requires building and testing a minimum viable product to determine the markets reaction. He advocates attention to innovation accounting to measure progress in the market's acceptance of your product or service and to avoid vanity metrics. Of all the concepts in the book the idea of what it will take to build a minimum viable product is the one necessity for which I didn't see any clear-cut guidance. I do not say this as a criticism of the book because the entrepreneur must use vision and judgment to decide what a minimum viable product or service must be. It is this product or service that starts the process of learning what the market wants that is critical to success. Simply building a product or providing a service because the entrepreneur thinks that the market wants it leads to failure. Ries gives an approach based on testing and learning what the market wants while conserving money and resources that gives an entrepreneur a better chance at success.<br /><br />This is a book written by someone who has experienced success and failure. He understands what it takes to succeed. I strongly recommend the book.

193700788X|1.0|This is the first time I have ever written a review on amazon. I am so disappointed in CH for the way this series ended. I really think she got burned out with this series and threw something together just to end it, which is so sad. Not only she let her fans down, she let herself down. She (CH) put so many years of writing this series, evolving these characters, I think all of us here, who enjoyed the series would have totally understood if she wanted to take 2 or 3 years to take a break, and came back refreshed to end the series.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert* DEA made no sense at all. I wasn't a big fan of Eric and Sookie being together at first, but in the end, I was really hoping that she would have ended up with him especially after all they have went through. She really had Eric go out pretty pathetic. In fact, he really wasn't in this book at all. I would have thought he would have killed Felipe de Castro and Freyda somehow to be with Sookie.<br /><br />Sookie ends up with Sam??? Where was the development to draw them romantically closer in the TB series? All this time, CH developed them as being friends. How about Alcide or anyone else where there was some kind of attraction going on? Did she put all the men of TB in a hat, and pulled out a name and said, \\"yep, this is who Sookie will end up with?\\" There was no mystery in this book, the villains were pathetic, especially the part where they kidnapped her in the van and the dialog that conspired between the three stooges. Amazingly stupid!<br /><br />For all of the lack of writing, plot, and character development, she could have just ended the book with Sookie arriving home to find a nuclear bomb in her house, the ultimate payback from Copley Carmichael and blow up everyone. The end indeed.
B00943SQCI|3.0|Liked some of the actor's performances, liked some of the special effects; story line didn't really do much for me.  Didn't like the ending, the female character turned out to be without honor.  &#60;shrug&#62;  Might have been a stronger, more likeable story with a different ending where she behaved honorably.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|watching whatever shows you pirate, you'll need this on your kindle. very helpful and its playback is really great. Yeah
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I voted three star because sometimes I play it and I struggle a lot its because when I read the construction I get it and it won't end the game.

B00846TTDG|5.0|I though this movie was exciting and on the edge of your seat gripping. It really takes the stand of military missions and brings into life.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Coolermaster is killing it with this air cooler. There's no other cooler in this price range that can touch its performance. The included fan and thermal interface are arguably the best at their price points, despite the unit being a push or pull only (1 fan) setup, unlike several of the larger dual tower pieces (noctua/phanteks/thermalright) that are more expensive and way larger. The kit is easily upgradeable to a push pull setup and performs excellently enough to overclock any modern cpu well. The only problem I have with the kit is the installation bracket. It's super hard to install it correctly sometimes and the screws are a bitch to put in. Other than that, I have no qualms with this kit. I've used it in several builds and it's been the best budget purchase I've had in a while.
B00CM6ZLG8|3.0|It really is a great CD, I was just expecting the rest of her songs to be like heart attack. Half the album is upbeat and the other is more sultry. It's not bad, I just would have bought the individual upbeat songs separate had I known.
B005UBNL0A|3.0|Overclocks well and gives pretty decent framerates. This chip is personally not too impressive in my opinion and you're better off getting a more expensive FX chip or just going all the way intel to get good frames. That being said, this is still a great budget chip contender for many.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is epic! I used to watch my Dad play this on his phone. I got the game and I say you get it to<br />:D
0812550706|5.0|Skip the movie and get straight to the good parts. Read this book. It will seriously change your life. I read it during high school at the recommendation of my friend and it gets to the heart of a lot of things that people who are intelligent are interested in: control, war, physics, metaphysics, video games, morality, ethics, politics, weaponry, science fiction, alternate universes, et al. There's nothing this book doesn't cover that isn't uninteresting and the story and plot of it are in the ranks of the best science fiction novels I have ever read: vonnegut, wells, heinlen, Philip K Dick, et al. This story is an instant classic and a must read for any sci-fi fan.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My 2 year old son loves this app. It is the first one that keeps him entertained for a good while!  Plus he loves popping the balloons or bubbles at the end of each puzzle!
B001DUDKEY|5.0|I love the story and it stayed close to the book.The acting was good.  There were great characters that you love to hate.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Really great album. It grows on you. You think you like one track the best and then a couple plays later you have a different favorite. Giorgio by Moroder is eerily beautiful. Giorgio sounds a bit like Arnold Schwarzenegger. The whole album is really chilled out and awesome.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I must say, I started watching this show because I was peer pressured into doing it. I came in with the lowest expectations. That being said, I was proven wrong within the first 2 episodes of this fantastic show. Was it the acting? Cinematography? Costume design? Music? Story line? Yes...all that and much more. HBO outdid itself. This show is fantastic.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|cannot stop singing all the songs!  Tooo funny and loved all of the cast!  Reccommended to anyone who loves to laugh!
B004LROUNG|2.0|Grisham nose-dived for me some time ago. Based on a few reviews, I gave this a try. It was not even average, he seems to have lost his touch or has become lazy.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|You can't go wrong watching this show!  Amazing and the acting is superb.  It is so interesting and I swear I should have lived during that time period.  The men on the show are also gorgeous ;)
B0087YYHZU|4.0|I got a chance to see this on film, and then immediately bought it on Blu Ray. Singing in the Rain is such a wonderful classic! Excellent songs, incredible dances,  an engaging storyline that even my 6 year old can follow without any difficulty. Although the quality is there,  it could be a smidgen clearer (but not  much).  The only reason I give it 4 stars is the fact that there's not a combo pack available, or a digital copy.
B004SIPA0A|5.0|I couldn't afford this when it first came out, and am happy to finally add it to my collection! All packaging and contents were in tact, and the cardstock wrap art was still present! Great deal!!!!!
B00CL68NOG|4.0|It was funny and the acting was good. The movie led me to plan a father son road trip next month
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|This film was well done and did a great job of reflecting the key scenes from the novel.  However, I am not sure I could have followed the story line very well if I had not read the book first.  The book includes five separate but related stories unstacked and restacked like nesting boxes which was challenging in its own right.  The movie runs all the stories in parallel and, at least to me, did not give the viewer enough context as to what was going on so could be frustrating.  I enjoyed Cloud Atlas more on second viewing and could appreciate what I think they were trying to achieve with the editing of scenes.  Reading the book first definitely enhances the film in my opinion.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|It would seem like all the singing would make the movie less enjoyable, but they did a great job. The emotions the actors put into the songs made the movie much deeper. This is one of the few recent movies i could watch again and still be awed.
0670014893|4.0|THis novel is le Carre's best since the Constant Gardener.  In this novel, he explores the British Government's relationship with an US-based civilian \\"security\\" company hand how the government's reliance on them goes terribly wrong.<br /><br />Compelling characters, believable situations and excellent dialogue add to the fantastic storytelling.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Compared to other recent movies, this is decent. However, it's not really a James Bond movie anymore. It's just another generic action movie that was saved by a talented cast. If you appreciate the old James Bond movies, don't watch this.
B0095P31L6|5.0|Rango was a enjoyable movie. It had a few words that some might not find suitable for kids 9 and under otherwise it was a great movie. We really enjoyed it.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael has outdone himself this time. The original song is great and his voice is just awesome, and album to be enjoyed by everyone no matter their age.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When I first realized that I was reading a book about kids with cancer, I thought that I'd been hoodwinked. I didn't want to be depressed. I was not depressed and neither will you be. Cleverly written and deeply thoughtful. I'm impressed.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|Something I don't mind watching with my kiddos. The comedy in this movie is something both adults and children can enjoy together. KITTY =)
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|While it is not unheard of for bands to replace their lead singer, it is never a popular decision and the results usually yield harsh blowback. AIC is no stranger to the criticism, however no band has been able to overcome the odds and earn acclaim afterword like this band either! Most of that thankfully is due to their style of a two voice melody band, and perhaps this allows for this continuation to be both enjoyable and successful. The production of this album is crisp, dynamic, and nearly flawless like albums from the 90's. It is the exact opposite of what you hear from other rock bands suffering from the loud wars situation. The songs are very fleshed out, from changing the melody midsection to layers of atmospheric guitars tracked over some of Jerry's best guitar solos I can honestly say I've heard from the band over 19 years. Layne is gone but the magic is still here, the songs are Great so enjoy them!
B00BEIN9VO|5.0|it's a great album,playing it all the time,love the vinyl copy, makes the party jump. The album came on time
B005V7UW3W|5.0|great series...<br />reminded me of my younger days with my daughter except I wasn't as scatterbrained as the mother!<br /><br />Bye
B0081FO2Q4|4.0|Great songs, but took FOREVER to download. Full album took like 20 minutes to load and I am very impatient
B009AMANBA|3.0|Politics bore me. However it was interesting seeing that it was the democrats that did<br />not want to free the slaves.
B001K3EXTA|3.0|The cinematography is incredibly lacking and cant even capture the splendor of the real life sets.  The acting is actually good by Waterston, Dern and Redford, but the screenplay just doesn't give them a fighting chance to be &#34;great&#34;.  The film seems to just plod through the novel as if it was forced to, think college assignment that lacks imagination or passion. It makes no attempt to challenge the viewer with the finer nuances of the novel and certainly doesn't honor the original work as a &#34;Great&#34; American piece of literature.
0670026603|5.0|Characters were well developed, felt as though did get to know them.  Could sympathize and empathize with them. Book was interesting from beginning to end. Most books take too long to get into.
B005C8ENI0|1.0|I found it very boring. How could anyone  include &#34;Lincoln&#34; in the title of this boring movie - was it to intentionally to mislead?
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Well done by Jennifer Lawrence and a terrific supporting cast.  Already looking forward to the second movie in the series.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|This is a very well-made thriller, but I didn't see the Oscar-worthiness of it. Good acting, period setting, taut script etc. But the narrative follows a very predictable arc.
B00COHIFQS|4.0|First off the streaming quality was excellent. Amazon has gotten even better at streaming than Netflix despite Netflix having been in the streaming business long before Amazon. The movie itself was worth wasting a couple hours. It had its jump out and grab you moments. Other than that is easily forgettable and will never reach a cult status following.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Highly recommend this film.  The relationship between the two main characters is a special, unique one.  This film has stayed with me.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|A retired CIA agent (Nielson) travels across Europe and relies on his old skills to save his estranged daughter, who has been kidnapped while on a trip to Paris.<br /><br />Solid role by Nielen, you can actually feel his anger throughout as a father, making it very believable in his role.<br /><br />The action is non stop and the story roles along well until the climatic ending.<br /><br />A solid movie and a great one to watch.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book read it in 3 days it was so good, 11 o'clock got to sleep now/ read next book
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Gangster squad is a movie about a secret crew of police officers led by two determined sergeants work together in an effort to take down the ruthless mob king Mickey Cohen who runs the city.  Although this movie is loosely based on the real story of LA police's takedown of Cohen, it is nevertheless an entertaining action film.  Maybe not a classic like other mob era films, this movie if taken for what it is, an action film is a good movie to watch.  Sean Penn gives an outstanding performance as mob boss Cohen and the rest of the cast is solid as well in their roles.  The movie is at times a bit uneven in both the plot, action and character development which detracts from it being a five star movie and a movie in a class of the other classics in this genre.  Going into this expecting an action film and you wont be disappointed, going into this expecting a true in depth story and you will be disappointed.  This movie is a worthwhile watch for what it is.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|This was a very beautiful, poetic and tragically told story. I had seen the movie first, so I was a little bit afraid to read the book, especially since I've been dealing with a bout of depression. I thought it would further upset me to read it, I was wrong. Susie Salmon was a character you wanted to live again. Her poignant heaven and visits back to her family were quite emotional.<br /><br />Probably one of the best moments was when the father had to explain to Buckley that his sister was dead by using the game monopoly. It's been a lone time since I've cried while reading a book, but this one demanded some tears.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It takes a while to get to the stage where u can build up a huge base, but getting there is fun and entertaining
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|Amazon.com allowed me to purchase Temple Run Oz from my Kindle Fire but it won't allow me to download it on my Kindle Fire tablet at all. I know it is compatible with Android tablets as I was able to download it on my Nexus 7 tablet. Very disppointed I couldn't get it on my Kindle Fire also.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I remembered this story and movie from many years ago and always thought Gary Cooper did a wonderful job playing York.  I loved the fact that the writer and actors were not afraid to express how God worked in Sgt York's life and made him the man he became.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Great performance by Tommy Lee Jones as a town sheriff who (with the help of a Civil War General) solve a murder he witnessed as a child.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I don't remember bad language or nudity in this movie. There was no shooting, explosians or even blood. There was talk of religion and God(s). Oddly enough it was a great movie with lots of action and beautiful sceanery. Suggested for all ages.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I really like Buble. I would rather just listen to him rather than watching him, he jumps around too much but his voice is beautiful.
B0090RSYVG|4.0|I purchased this keychain at the same time I bought an R2-D2 minifig keychain and I can definitely sat that this one has held up much better under daily use. The only part of the keychain that is showing any signs of wear is the cape (but really, that is to be expected). Other than that, I am in love with the detail and hardiness of this keychain.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|When I started this book, I was a bit wary.  I am not a fan of the fantasy genre, and I only knew of this book from the trailers of the movie, which I have not viewed.  Yann Martel masterfully takes the reader on one voyage with Pi, all the while taking the reader on a journey of his/her own.
B000ICKPOQ|4.0|I love watching this on Amazon, because some nights I can't sleep and I can watch 7 episodes in a row. Each episode is more entertaining then the last one.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|All I wanted was all eight movies and that is what I received. The DVDs are in perfect condition and the box is very compact. The movies were in great condition, no skipping or scratches. I would get this if you are just looking for the movies without any special features! There is a special features open on the main menu however it is very limited in its capabilities.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Couldn't put it down! From the very first page, I was mesmerized by the characters and their stories. A good historical perspective as well as real insight into the emotional toll of foster care.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I really enjoyed this read. A very troubled main character who grabs at your heart as she learns trust and love.
B009ZRY0IC|5.0|This is such a beautiful album! I love every song on it. Ben Howard truly has an amazing voice! I look forward to hearing more from him in the future.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved this book based on truth. How the two stories intertwine was interesting. And would certainly recommend this book. Read it
B00BFBBN3G|5.0|A really great movie! Also as a previously viewed movie, product was in extremely good condition. Good movie for kids.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|Not a bad movie. Wished it followed the book more. The special effects are good as well. I teach younger students. They have had the book read to them. Everyone of them would give it 5 stars.
0345803485|3.0|I wished that the writer would use more synonyms and antonyms to eliminate the redundancies and repetition like \\"oh crap\\", \\"oh please\\" and \\"exasperated\\". Trust me I've seen those words a lot it, bored me.<br /><br />The storyline was quiet slow i didn't know where it was going, i wanted more scoop on Christian's side of story. Ana was too dumb and naive. i wanted the writer to introduce \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" so that the story could be more intense and reveal the reactions of the characters.<br /><br />I liked that the sex scenes were very descriptive i could visualize it like a movie in my head! lol. I'm unto 50 Shades Darker and i hope the story develops and is much more better than the first! thats all :)
B003CSV7TK|5.0|One can never go wrong with Miracle on 34th Street~!  This movie is a classic.  I highly recommend putting it in your yearly watched holiday movies!!!
B004RLN3QG|5.0|Dust Bowl is one of those recordings where each and every song is a jewel.  There is nothing but excellent music here, played and sung at the highest level.  The technique and flare shown by Joe Bonamassa on the blues guitar entitles him to be listed in the top 10 blues players of the last 50 years.  His vocals are a perfect match to his guitar style.  I listen to this music frequently and I get a big smile of pleasure each time.  If you love the blues and rock, you will love this recording.
B002SYXCVK|3.0|Actually there are only a few songs on this CD  I like. Wouldn't buy this again. I guess I am not really a Sting fan.
1742200508|4.0|I've used my share of travel guides over the years and many are quite nice. Lonely Planet's England is right up there with the best. For each major section of England an introductory page provides you with city/town's in that area, provides a list of the best places to eat, best places to stay, why you should visit that area, and the best time of year to visit. Additionally, there are listed ancient sites and overall activities in the locale.<br /><br />In other words, this guide provides you with really detailed, exhaustive information about the various areas of England, which is really super for travelers like me who want to visit the tiny places and eat in pubs where locals dine as well as the more upscale places. Additionally, I want to travel England to visit historical sites, so Lonely Planet's guide hits that mark square on.<br /><br />I am definitely going to use this guide to help plan my vacation to England!<br /><br />Really great!
0307346609|4.0|World War Z is more than science fiction.  Mr. Brooks provides insights about people when they are in danger and without the trapping of normal society.  While his examples of human behavior is extreme, in real life I've seen his examples, in a milder form, displayed in people around.  Easy and fun reading.  A summer vacation book.
B005NNVUBM|3.0|If you listen closely to the middle part of Grandchester Meadows you can hear the part where Roger Waters bites the head off of a bunny with lots of crunching noises and slurping...it is too sickkkkkkkkkk!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Creative, excellent, intriguing, never certain what was going to happen. It kept me guessing and wondering about what enchantment was going to unfold next
B00B97SNDY|5.0|This new album by Dawes is great. A bit different from Nothing is Wrong in its tone, but it still sounds like them.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I would reccommend anyone to watch this. Gives a true meaning to autism and how they perceive things on a daily basis. A good quality learning movie for the whole family to watch.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I started watching &#34;The Good Wife&#34; well into the second season, so I have been very interested in seeing Season 1 to get caught up on the story lines.  This is a great show with interesting twists, wonderful actors, stories that keep you coming back for more.  I highly recommend this series.
B002OMZTSK|3.0|I liked this book, it's funny how years later schools have changed.  Overall, I can relate to having a secret and being able to share it with kindred spirits. This book brought back those memories when I turned 27 as suppose to these kids in high school.  In the end it's all about the truth, to yourself and to others that will help set you free.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This movie is hilarious! The classic \\"college kids vs evil country rednecks\\" but from a new point of view. We must watch it again, since I'm sure we missed some details because we were laughing so much. The ending was a little weak but the action throughout the movie more than made up for it. I strongly recommend this movie.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Love how the writers segue from the old Star Trek theme into the alternate timeline in a believable fashion. Thumbs up to the casting and actors for staying true to the personalities of the original characters. Looking forward to seeing the next installment.
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|Imagine Blade meets Van Helsing and you've pretty much got Hansel and Gretel. The witch fighting and gadgets used is very much in the style of the latter whilst the fight sequences (ninja witches) is in the style of Blade. It is a good action film with plenty of action and still remaining loosely linked to the fairy tale.<br />The story isn't that deep beyond that so don't expect a film that will leave you thinking after it ends but sometimes a good beat em up film is what you want every now and then.
B009MYARIK|4.0|It was a fun escape.  Want  my daughter to read it.  She went through a divorce a year ago and could use a laugh.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Dr. Alexander's story is really amazing. I enjoyed reading the book very much. He lost me a few times when speaking medically, but overall, I enjoyed the book a lot.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Daft Punk is a Electronic Music group consisting of French musicians Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter.<br /><br />They are famous for songs like \\"Harder Better Faster\\" and \\"Aerodynamic\\" both of which are present on their seminal album \\"Discovery\\". The group return for their fourth studio record \\"Random Access Memories\\" in which they make a change and abandon their classic sound for a new 70's inspired beat. I personally have enjoyed Daft Punk for quite a while, I'm not even sure when I started listening to them, just one day there was Daft Punk.<br /><br />The album features songs which should be good for people who have been listening to Daft Punk for years as well as people who are new to their sounds and music. My favorite song from the Album at the moment is \\"Lose yourself to Dance\\" though I also really like \\"Get Lucky\\" which features the most prominent disco era music.
B006FE83UE|5.0|My son had to read the book in school. It was great to get to watch the movie with him. The extra bonus features were a great bonus.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I like playing this on my kindle but Don't like how you have to spend gold. Other than that I like this game
B00BUI6D2A|1.0|I was listening to one of lil Wayne's song. I do not know the name of it; however, it states as long as my b%$%^^es love me and satan loves him also etc..... I am not quite sure what this means, only in my head and beliefs, lil wayne is gone. He has sold his soul to the devil. When he first got started with 'juvenile', he was doing okay. somewhere down the line he did a song in jail on top of the table, this was a sign to me then his soul was leaving his body and kissing his supposed to be daddy on the lips intimately. This guy believes he is untouchable. I am glad my daughter does not listen to his lyrics anymore, neither do I. I am afraid his bad spirit will penetrate into my thoughts and take control over my thoughts of NOT believing in GOD (who is ALPHA and the OMEGA).<br />I know I may receive several replies, but it does not matter. If you do, this means you believe in what lil wayne believes in, unfortunately, this does not bother me to say the least; fortunately, the bible states who wins in the end (THE BELIEVERS OF GOD ALMIGHTY). Blessings to all who are not following this guy anymore. IN THE NAME OF JESUS. AMEN.<br />READ II TIMOTHY 3 in the bible....
B009CF3MEK|5.0|Fitzgerald's masterpiece with excellent cast.  Bruce Dern and Karen Black are almost perfect as the cheating spouses.  Mia Farrow and Redford are perfect as the star crossed lovers.  Sam Waterson is the best as Mia's much removed cousin.  I have seen this movie so many times, it is a classic.
B000SVZIDA|5.0|I really enjoy this movie. During my college sophomore year, my roommates and I used to watch this movie at least probably three times a week, so I figured that it was about time I owned it myself.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its an awesome game .I like the coarse a lot better than the first temple run but I wish it had more carecters.
B004SIP6A4|5.0|I quite enjoyed this movie, but then again, I'm partial to musicals. The acting, dancing, singing, costumes are all fantastic.
B000056HE9|5.0|The Bishop's Wife is a movie that is not considered a &#34;Christmas Classic&#34;- at least it's not shown over and over again on and main channel...but should be!!  What a wonderful message it sends!!!
B00457WZEI|5.0|Warhorse is my favorite book cause it is sad happy and exciting in one. You should get it and you will come to love it
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This movie was great. Great movie the entire family could watch together it was very inspirational and gave me goosebumps!!! Also great addition to movie collection.
B005CA4SJW|4.0|This season is special but has parts of the show is missing. Like how Rick and Glenn got the zombie guts on their yellow outfits. That was cut out.
B00A4YB5I8|5.0|I actually owned this cd 3 times, 1 was scratched up from being handled so much, 2 lost/stolen. This is one of the best CDs ever made, a true classic.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is really fun and creative! I enjoy playing it all day long. I'm 16 and its still fun, so I bet little kids enjoy it just as much!!
B000UX6THK|5.0|Love this series and this is a nice complete set to have. It includes all of the log lady excerpts.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|Really a great sci-fi movie as good entertainment as my two sons and I watched together. laughed at some scenes
B00991TCOG|5.0|I recently learned about Lindsey Sterling when she appeared on Dancing with the Stars. I looked her up on the web, and decided to order her album.<br />I love the violin and Ms. Sterling has a unique style that I find very appealing. Her compositions are upbeat and mixed with voice and a 'be-bop' beat. I find that her music draws one in and keeps one listening to what will happen next<br />(I might also add that her videos are great to watch.)<br />I am very happy with this music and will listen to it many times, Why, I think I'll put it on right now.<br />Ms. Sterling, If you see this, thank you.
B0050X1OQ6|4.0|I replaced the 1gb of RAM installed in my Synology DS412+ NAS with this stick of 2gb RAM. I have yet to really even put a load on the RAM, as 2gb seems to be more than plenty for a Synology NAS. I am certainly glad I upgraded it though.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I enjoyed everything about this book and Puller.  Keep this series coming.  It is a story with all the right stuff.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|We thought this would be a great movie, with a great cast.  However, it turned out to only be frustrating and confusing.  It jumps back and forth to many different sets of characters in different places, worlds and eras.  We kept watching in hopes that eventually it would all tie together, but really never did.  Really wanted to see a good flick, but was sorely disappointed.  I would not recommend this to anyone.
B00CBRH4YU|5.0|The love story told beautifully through the lens of camera<br />Loved the story of child who is hopeful but then sees &#34;something is missing&#34; and encourages mother to leave, although mother continues to linger on<br />Children can sense when things are right and when they are no longer right<br />So much depth to this movie<br />A movie to watch many times<br />Done beautifully and not too often you come across a movie that touches your soul<br />Thank you, i look forward to getting the dvd when it comes out
B00CW665VI|5.0|Okay, I know this is unusual to write a review when I'm not even halfway finished w/this book but I just finished the sample and just downloaded this book and I have to say, so far I LOVE IT! Hearing this story from a guy's point of view is genius and Emma Chase nails it! Drew's (the male hero) thought process is hilarious and so true in so many ways, I'm totally enjoying it as i read and am basically hanging on every word and can't put it down, however, I'm at work now so Drew and Kate will have to wait (which I'm couting the hours til lunch so I can continue reading on my phone).  So as you can see, I am throughly enjoying this book and can't wait to finish it and yet don't want to cuz it's so much fun to read! Emma, looking forward to the next book in this series (i noticed in the title this is to be \\"The Tangled Series\\"? I hope?)..anyway, Great dialogue, thoughts and humor! Definitely 5 Stars!!!
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I love it because you can make an obsidian room with no roof around the spawn point and when people join your world you can shoot them with a bow.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like it a lot but I think u should be able to cahnge it from creative to survival to play hunger games and u can open chests in creative thx
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This book was as amazing as all his other books. It was truly a page turner. I loved reading it!!!
B0044FEZBM|5.0|It is an excellent video. Awesome ballet and great dancers. The Bolshoi Ballet is the best. I enjoyed this DVD
0060723513|5.0|I have lost count of how many times I have read this book. It is one of my favorites and I have bought many copies for my friends as well. Its message is timeless and important.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This is not something I would usually read but I joined a book club and it was one of our picks. I'm glad it was picked. It was interesting and really gave me a new view point on indentured servitude. At times it was hard to read because of the poor treatment some of the characters received because they were slaves. I cringed at some of the things that were done.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|This is a great album and Joe shows a lot more emotion & creativity here and he's on top his game. I enjoy listening to every song in this album. This clearly shows why he is the most popular and inspirational guitar player ever! Guthrie Govan is the only other guitarist in the running....and Steve Vai sucks!
B0089LOG02|5.0|The author is very descriptive and gives a good picture of part of our history that most of us know little about.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book.  It was so very well written.  Dialogue was very real.  Character development was excellent.  It was a tear jerker and I couldn't put it down.
0061733199|5.0|As a veteran of the U S Army and a prepper, I find this handbook a valuable asset in survival information. A great book, and I recommend it for anyone who is in the prepper world.
1609611543|5.0|Best Diet Ever.  I consider it a lifestyle change.  Already 20 pounds lost in just over 3 months, and never hungry.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is a great app. Able to get everything from recipe ideas to diy crafts. I recommend pinterest to all. Love it , love it, love it.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|it was just ok. Tommie Lee Jones was very good but the story was sort of undeveloped or something. the really good thing is that even tho it was suppose to be about these grizzly murders we did not have to see blood torture and all that. nothing was shown.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|It's all too much and I felt myself getting bored with the movie.  Individual performances are great, but it's wrapped up in a lot of &#34;stuff.&#34;
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Very suspenseful and thought provoking. Truly amazing the strength and love this family had for one another, enduring through some very extremely tough odds.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Haley Berry, much like Charlize Theron in Prometheus, is acting somewhere in the mid range of her ability, in Cloud Atlas. Berry is an award-winning actress, when the role places her acting at the proper scale, such as in Monster's Ball where every setting is so intimate that you merely have to hand her the lines, set some dramatic lighting, and get out of her way. Her chops tend to get buried more in a larger scale film with so many grandiose visual elements as Cloud Atlas, but that's not to say she floundered the role. When paired with Tom Hanks, at a bare minimum they are very watchable together, and this is not Hanks worst role either. He has a way of infusing some degree of charm into his characters even when it barely makes sense, as moments of this film prove.<br /><br />That being said, obviously most people's reaction to this movie will be confusion. You can hype it all you want, but to say it is not confusing is a stretch. As I stated, it's not the acting that does it, but mainly the fact that the stories only loosely connect and it's awkward to have Berry and Hanks play all these characters as if to suggest that they were descendants of one another. This is especially confusing considering that reincarnation does appear to be a theme.<br /><br />After reading the Wikipedia page on this film's plot (a ritual I've grown accustomed to), the only thing I learned was that the individual stories are not intended to connect as much as I was trying to make them. Some will say that Hanks' acting was amazing, because he played so many roles, but the extreme accent and costume variations that set those characters apart were awkward at the extreme ends of the spectrum. I am sure there was no shortage of viewers asking \\"what the heck did they just say?\\" Despite the fact that I enjoyed the film, it was not as good as I expected, and my wife and I often looked at each other like \\"what just happened; I'm lost?!\\"
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is perfect. I don't have any issues with it. It's very addicting! I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves a good old fashion card game.
B009AJD5E0|3.0|Acting:<br />I seriously doubt anyone's career will be made or broken based on this, but it was far from the embarrassment of squandering Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder, & Ron Perlman the way the 3rd film did. Here, despite the illogical design of the plot, the actors performed at least decently. (Warning: plot spoiler in the next sentence) However, after Charlize Theron's character was killed, then the movie was somewhat balanced on the shoulders of less riveting actors, which even dragged her performance down, when looking back upon this film. Regardless, it was far from her awkwardly overacted Snow White performance. Most of the actors/actresses at least performed on a level well above the gutter-level, where the franchise lost course after A3.<br /><br />Plot:<br />Other reviewers have gone to lengths to explain all the ways the character's decisions made no sense, and it is true that this is typically the key aspect of most plots, however in the case of comic book and science fiction type movie, plot also serves on a macro level to tie-in other chapters, background stories, and to explain or justify supernatural forces which defy common science. So, on a mirco level like a play, this is far from Shakespeare, and the motivations and justifications for each character's actions are wildly skewed, but for me this was merely a vehicle to deliver the actions of placing this group of screw-ups in the right place at the right time to cause the critical error that gave birth to countless nightmares later in the chronology. Of course, the more extreme nerds will not be able to resist the kind of over-analysis that can shred any appreciation of a film like this. But, if no one was stupid in a sci-fi/horror film, then no one would die or make the critical errors that led to this otherwise mostly non-regrettable franchise.<br /><br />Appearance:<br />Clearly the film's strong suit is it's often mind-numbing CGI and the way it blends so seamlessly in most scenes. The only part where the illusion may have been broken a bit was when the robotic guy's head was laying there talking and it just felt like an invisible body, and not the visceral milk-blood robot head that it strove to reference and be similar to, from Alien 3. The rolling ship was a very cool scene, even if it was a little bit of a forced Indiana Jones thing. The hologram parts were very cool, and overall it was money well spent on both the graphics and the special effects make-up. I cannot say as much for the bottled set design or forced toy marketing of Resurrection or Alien Vs Predator 1-2.<br /><br />Overall:<br />The film did it's job of rebooting the franchise, under proper direction. with a fairly ample cast and some flashy technology. Of course the actions and motivations of the characters can tend to be a bit flimsy in a way that does not render cliches into tropes, because it does not really shout-out the sort of films where an idiot going into a dark place is charmingly classic. However, the script was actually written nicely, which is a key element seldom mentioned, and also sorely lacking from the blunder of Resurrection. With enjoyable special effects, a decent script, and mostly ample performances, I don't see a reason why this film is not a suitable addition to the franchise. It is a situation where I am afraid our memory of the early films is greater than the films themselves. The first film was almost entirely shot in the dark and barely showed the alien at all. The second film had a big part played by Paul Riser (the man should have a tattoo that says \\"campy\\"), and the series really only reached fever pitch in the third film, which raised the bar on the franchise only long enough for it to be plunged into the abyss of the next 3 films. So, what hardcore nerds want out of this film is impossible to deliver (much like Star Wars, Evil Dead, Star Trek, etc). It was a great concept in the macro-plot, driven by a clumsy mini-plot, with an ample script, ample acting, and mind-bending graphics.ng, and mind-bending graphics.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is not only the best book, but the most realistic. It helps you understand all of life. It definitely made an impact on me. It's a \\"Wow\\" because I believe you can't get any better than \\"wow.\\" I have and will never read a book as \\"wow\\" as this one. Bravo, John Green. You have done it again.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|SOOOO HANDY to have this on my Kindle!  I use it nearly every day!  This app is a must have.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I haven't had all that much of a chance to play but from what I have played, I'd say this is , without a doubt, one of the best games I've played on my kindle fire.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I absolutely adore this App and use it daily!  This is where my life is truly organzied on my Kindle!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Okay, so I love this game. You start of with a teeny tiny little reef and grow a bunch of different kinds of coral and stuff to attract more fish. I'm not sure how long it's been since I first got this game but my reef is pretty awesome now if I do say so myself. Can take a bit to grow some of the plants but it's so much fun.
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|I've only been able to get a quarter of the way through the book because it is so melodramatic it hurts. I do not recommend this book at all.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Not alot of games stick around long for me but this one is actually pretty fun. My park is getting pretty big now and I have almost all of the dinosaurs. I also love that although you can spend real money, you don't HAVE to because they give you the special money every time you level up. So if you want something that requires it, all you have to do is save up enough. Yaay for not spending real money!
B00263HWM8|3.0|The team of the original show days is over.  This is a one man show for sure.  Tom Cruise you like or you hate him.  I thought it was ok.
B008VBYN80|2.0|I didn't really want to link to my facebook or have to try to get my friends to play with me. Unfortunately, if you are like me, the only way to complete the quests that require you to do so is to pay with real money. Sorry, but not worth it.
B009NY43NY|4.0|It was time. We had a good run with Sookie, and now she can start living her life.  The list of characters became convoluted. This was a pretty good ending to a sometimes predictable, but engaging story.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|How much can you really say about an alarm clock? It's got a few different alarm sound to choose from so I can have a nice soft alarm for setting reminders for random things throughout the day and of course good old fashioned loud, annoying beeping for when I actually want to wake up in the morning. Plus it shows you the current weather in the top left of the screen. I did not notice that at first. Pretty cool.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The game puts a realistic feel into the title of marvel's Ironman. This game put  the movie into a large, fun, and extreme playing experience. The way the story line is shown makes the playerwant to keep playing. Overall Gameloft did agreat job on this game.
B00AQMSJI2|2.0|Okay, so at first I thought it might be kinda cool but it takes forever to load and EVERYTHING you do brings up another loading screen. It was alright but it's really not fun enough to be worth the time.
B000OLX4SU|5.0|I use this movie in my class when the students also study the novel Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes.  They are able to make very thoughtful comparisons.  The students like this version of the movie even though it is very violent.  They think that Robert De Niro is fantastic.

B004W1GCNC|5.0|The series began a little slow in the beginning of part one but I persevered and was glad I did. Once I had finished the first episode I couldn't wait until I had time to watch the next one and the one after that. The storyline is interesting. The characters interact with real people from the era such as the Duke of Kent, King George's younger brother. I hope more seasons are in the works.

B005PK57NU|5.0|At this point, I am less interested in the romance of the two romantic leads, but more fascinated with the wonderful supporting characters. Archie Panjabi, Alan Cumming, and Matt Czuchry stand out above the rest. Their characters are what keep me watching right now!

B007L6VR6M|5.0|I'm not a big fan of indie films but I really love this one, it's cute and entertaining!  I like that it comes with a blu-ray, original DVD, and a code for an online copy so it makes it really simple to watch it anywhere.  Great price too!
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|Loved it! Just the few new parts made the whole movie so much better. I would recommend it to anyone who loves the series, you won't regret buying it.

B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Not the worst movie I've ever seen but close.<br /><br />This movie was poorly written, overly depressing and totally unrealistic. The two soon-to-be 40-year olds in this movie act like and speak like a couple of drunken sailors throughout including dropping outrageous profanity in front of their 8-year old daughter.<br /><br />Speaking as a 40-something year-old adult nobody my age acts like the two co-stars did in this film so it was impossible to identify with them. Instead of exploring the humorous aspects of being middle-aged, writer/director Judd Apatow took the lazy path by falling back on tired formula of shocking the viewer with overly crude jokes and situations (spoiler) such as Paul Rudd being spread eagle looking at his anus with a mirror and taking photos of it with his iPhone to figure out if he has a hemorrhoid. The same formula worked in 40-year old Virgin and Knocked Up because there were enough funny moments and positive aspects to keep the film entertaining. Unlike those movies, This Is 40 relies almost exclusively on disgusting humor and profanity to carry the film... It doesn't.<br /><br />Even with all those shortcomings the movie could have at least been OK had it not been incredibly depressing from start to finish.<br /><br />A big pass. Don't waste your time or money.

B00CFA227C|3.0|Rumored that \\"Jack\\" was doomed to flop, you may assume that going into the film that it may be terrible. That isn't the case. It was just an expensive film to make, approximately $190 million. Based on the fact, that Warner Brothers Studios has numerous movies (\\"Harry Potter\\", \\"Dark Knight\\", \\"The Hobbit\\") in its pocket that will make up for whatever loss, if any, \\"Jack\\" sustains, you should not weep for them. Although, you may consider whether or not to take the time to go see it in theaters or get the bluray/DVD.<br /><br />Why not! It's a fun movie. Not to mention, it is one of those rare movies that anybody in the family can watch and enjoy. There are some dark moments in the film and some mildly scary moments, but it's all fun. We all know the story of Jack and the Beanstalk and now, with today's incredible technology, we can see this fairy tale, mostly imagined up to this point, in vivid 3-D and live action or CG action.<br /><br />Director Bryan Singer knows a thing or two about bring us fairy tale characters. He's directed two X-Men films and a Superman film. So, telling the story of Jack and his magical beans is right up his alley. We all know the story and Singer managed to keep those same elements in the film. The best part about \\"Jack the Giant Slayer\\" is the script; until the ending. Most of the time, these type movies are made just to appease the visual desires of a film-goer, but this film has many surprising twists and turns. Although, it isn't without a little bit of criticism from this reviewer.<br /><br />The first two-thirds of the film are filled with surprises and quality writing that keeps the audience riveted. When the humans enter the world of the giants, I found the whole experience to be incredibly realized and reminiscent of the movie \\"King Kong\\". It was amazing and frightening at the same time, especially when one giant tracks down a running human as if he were catching a mouse and picked him up as if his catch was pretty much insignificant.<br /><br />My beef comes from the choices made in the final third of the film. They had built up so much possibility with script direction. There was the world of the giants. There was the love story between Jack and Princess Isabelle. There was the massive treasure that the giants had horded overtime from the humans. Yet, I think that they chose the less interesting of directions for the film. Battle; not in the more interesting giant world, but in the human world. The giants are really just mindlessly driven to battle. They have no heart-filled reason to do so, they just want to destroy and steal. We've seen so many battles on film in so many movies and they are always less interesting than a human motivated storyline. There was a reason for battle in \\"Braveheart\\". There was a reason for battle in \\"Glory\\", \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" or \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", but the reason for this battle was just boring.<br /><br />\\"Jack the Giant Slayer\\" is a great time at the movies for the whole family, I just wish it had a ending that was as personal and interesting as the rest of the film. Instead, we get an ending that reminded me of Burton's \\"Alice and Wonderland\\"; uninteresting CG junk.m the choices made in the final third of the film.

B00A757EFW|3.0|There is just not enough space on a tablet to play well. Have alway enjoyed this game and had looked forward to playing again.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|This movie really surprised me as I was not interested when it came out in the theater. The acting by Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio was just awesome. Personally I think Leo did a better job but thats not to take away from Jamie and his performance. The character development, action, dialogue and story all come together in this movie. There is also good humor and great exchanges between the actors.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|Great movie, especially if you were a gamer from Atari on. Unfortunately your kids wont know have of the characters or the games they come from so afterwards you can play them online.
B00BHNR1KQ|2.0|Nothing exciting here; it could also be that Im not really a fan of Ethan Hawke as an actor but this was mediocre in terms of scary. Sure there was a plot they were trying to build against but it was predictable along the way. The acting was Ok but nothing that brag about and there wasnt much interest in the characters. If one or all of them died I would have been fine with it either way. Just keep it moving
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I will say that anything you expect to happen will not. What happens is even better but if you are a comic book man then you will not be able to sleep after watching this. Hilarious, actiony, I loved it. Movie of the year so far
B005LAIII0|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this movie. First and foremost the cinematography was excellent; I really do mean excellent. The acting was great from every character, character development was awesome, very thought out and beautifully presented on screen. The performance while stranded on the raft with the tiger was really, really good and much credit is deserved. The story was fantastic. I would highly recommend this movie if you are looking for a change in your movie watching genre because it shows there where years of preparation for this movie. The best part of it all is the male lead for this movie wasn't even an actor when he got selected for this role.
B00CWVFPGO|3.0|The movie was somewhat entertaining, but had a &#34;B&#34; Movie feel to it.  I'm pretty easy to please, but the acting was rather cheezy and the script lacked credibility.
B00CWVFPGO|2.0|While it was cool to see Arnold back in the movies; it doesn't take away that this movie was sub-par in plot, acting, action and every other movie category. While there is plenty of action in this movie its just wasn't intended to be one of those movies that will captivate an audience. Save your time.

There were a couple of tracks that didn't grab me at first, but are really growing on me.<br /><br />In a music scene littered with Nickleback knock-offs, it sure is nice to have this band back.  I miss ya Layne, but life goes on...

B00AS1Q93S|5.0|We rented it, unsure of what to expect since neither of us had read a Jack Reacher novel.  Well, we were mesmerized.  There was something for everyone - a cool and handsome hero, a plot with substance and twists, and of course fights and car chases.  Definitely worth seeing.  I hope they make a sequel.

B000AC5B16|5.0|Decca has done it again with a great release from one of modern classical music's great composers.  The similarly packaged and released Debussy Decca release was good but had some problems which thankfully are not present here.  Not only is this release very handsomely packaged in a clamshell, slim and sturdy cardbox case which fit 4 cds and a 20-page booklet containing an essay about the composer in English, French and German but the sound quality is also of a very high order.  As the recordings here were done at around the same time period (1980s) by essentially the same performers the sound quality is consistently good which wasn't always the case with the Debussy release.  The only thing that would make this release perfect for me would be if \\"Gaspard\\", \\"Miroirs\\" and \\"Introduction & Allegro\\" were included as well but I suppose I could find these elsewhere.  Otherwise, there is little to complain about the performances here; are their better ones elsewhere?  Probably yes but the ones here are not chopped liver by any stretch of the imagination.  These great digital recordings come at an incredible value too given the current retail price.  Everybody knows \\"Bolero\\" but for me \\"Rapsodie espagnole\\" moves me a lot more but frankly there is really little not to like about any of the content here.<br /><br />Great selections, great packaging and very good sound quality makes this an easy review.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B007REW8DO|5.0|I really like Christina's voice. I love most of the songs in this album. And the fact that you can get the MP3 automatically is pretty convenient.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think this is one of the most fun, stimulating apps I've ever played! I downloaded it on impulse  from the Play Store on my Samsung S3. The colors are vibrant and easy to look at. There are several levels and each level gets harder as the number of columns and rows increase. The premise is to connect the colors without overlapping them. I like the fact that the app starts off with very easy levels, instead of overwhelming you with the harder levels from the start. My six-year-old nephew found the easy levels doable and easy. It was fun seeing him try different routes on his way to match the colors. My nephew has ADD, so with this app, he actually sat attentively for a stretch of time. The harder levels got me racking my brain. I love solving puzzles, so I saw this is a great challenge. After several attempts, I muttered out loud that it's impossible to connect them. That there's simply no way it can be done. Shortly afterwards, I had my \\"AHA\\" moment. It was fun! This app will certainly stimulate your brain. This app is a great way to kill time and exercise your brain while remaining very enjoyable as you're commuting or just waiting in a long queue.

I have read over 100 books in just the past year, most are on my Kindle and I'm happy to have them stay that way.  This book was so special (the pictures are great too) that I had to have it in hardcover.  I also got it to give as gifts to my cat loving friends, both male & female.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!!

B005PK1G76|5.0|I was looking for a stroller organizer bc the used Phil and Ted e stroller I bought didn't come with one.  Looking on their website, I didn't want to spend $25 for something I didn't like either.  I ordered this one and the Jolly Jumper Stroller Caddy - Stroller Handlebar Organizer.  I have a 40oz Klean Kanteen Classic Stainless Steel bottle that I wanted to fit into the caddy.  Because the Diono cup holders are flexible, I was able to fit my bottle in there!  I was happy about that.  It's not that deep though...I'd say it went up about half way up the canteen bottle, but it was tight enough for me not to worry about it falling out.  For the Jolly Jumper, I would've had to use the zippered portion to put that large bottle in there, so I returned that.  Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.  I can't say anything about durability just yet.  I'll be taking this on a 3 day trip to Disneyland at the end of June, so that'll be the test.

B008220BP2|5.0|Overall, I thought this movie was well written, well cast, and well acted. I thought the storyline was unique enough to branch out from the typical \\"supernatural teen romance\\" genre, and that Nicholas Hoult adds quality to what could have been an unforgettable film. I wasn't expecting fantastic, and I left feeling like my money was well spent, to say the least. I'd watch it again, and I plan on buying it.

B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I loved the book but was reluctant to see the movie since often the story is changed for the worse.<br />There is a lot of humor in the book because we hear Pat's inner thoughts and the conversations he<br />has with himself to create a normal life for himself. This was lost in the movie translation, but it<br />does stand for itself and was enjoyable, especially with Tiffany. While the overall was darker than<br />the book, I still enjoyed it and would recommend.

And The Kite Runner, which I read a couple years later, I remember as a bit clunky. Happily, I have not outgrown Hosseini, and this book feels real, lacking the contrived scenarios of The Kite Runner.<br /><br />And the Mountains Echoed is halfway between a novel and a short story collection. Each of its nine chapters is told through the eyes of a different character, some in first person and some in third, and while each chapter is connected in some way to the others, many of these characters never meet. Pari, who is the closest this book comes to a protagonist, is the focus of two or three chapters, but appears only briefly or not at all in several others. The story spans 60 years and is set mostly in Afghanistan, though there are also chapters set in the U.S., France and Greece.<br /><br />The structure is a great strength--each chapter tells a complete story, and some are quite hard-hitting--though it requires more engagement from the reader than your typical novel, as we must re-orient ourselves with each new chapter. But there are common themes running throughout. Much of the book focuses on caretakers: it begins with parents and their young children, then moves on to siblings, to young people just starting their own families, and to professional caretakers, and toward the end it progresses to adult children and their elderly parents. None of these relationships are simple: some of the characters can't handle caring for a sick or disabled person, not because they're evil but because they're flawed, as people are. And those who do stay and devote themselves to others often deal with anger and resentment. But it's not all negative; strong relationships form and several characters turn out better than we might have expected.<br /><br />Of course, Hosseini's genius is in his ability to tap into readers' emotions--even jaded readers like me who are on the lookout for emotional manipulation. And this book is no exception. If I had to guess I'd say it works because it feels honest; no one is all good or bad, just regular, imperfect people in all-too-real situations. The 22-page chapter about Parwana and Masooma made me care more than did several full-length novels I've read lately. As did the chapter about Idris, though in a different way: it's ugly in its honesty; I wanted to be angry with him but it would be all too easy to become him.<br /><br />I could talk about the more literary aspects of this book, but that isn't really the point. The character development is good, and the writing is good. There's some strong imagery, and life in all of the places and times portrayed in the book feels credible and real. But what really makes this book shine isn't so much literary merit as the ability to evoke strong feelings and get readers to care about the characters--and while it won't work for everyone, it certainly worked for me.<br /><br />Not to say there aren't some issues: sometimes Hosseini seems to take the safe way out (as with the celibate gay man), and that tiresome trope where two women with a previously close relationship fight over a man rears its ugly head not once but twice (for extra creepy weirdness, the second time involves a woman and her 14-year-old daughter). And because each chapter focuses on a different character, several only peripheral in the stories of the others, most people will have a least favorite: mine is the chapter about Adel, the son of a former jihadi fighter turned drug trafficker and philanthropist. The father and his role in the community are interesting, but I could have done without Adel's coming-of-age story. Still, every chapter adds a crucial link to the story.<br /><br />Ultimately, this was a pleasant surprise, and a powerful one. I recommend it, with this advice: clear some time in your schedule, and keep the tissues handy.-even jaded readers like me who are on the lookout for emotional manipulation.

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|While reading all I could think is wow! They should teach this before people get involved with any person, it makes so much sense, I have been through enough relationships that I have always treated others how I wanted to be treated and rarely been treated in the correct manner, I am now in a wonderful relationship, and was so worried that something would eventually be wrong, but I believe that we have been greatly filling our love tanks. I believe that even great relationships could benefit from this great read, because people get complicated and well someone once told me when I asked what was the secret to her long marriage, she said I really believe we never fell out of love or tired of each other at the same time. Renewable love is the key, making time to love the one you love.
B000F0UUIM|5.0|I'm from Texas and this movie always touches a cord for me because of it's depiction of the early pioneers and their hardships and independence.  The movie also does a good job of showing the effect the War Between the States had on some soldiers.  Many of them did not blend back in with their families and were loners, moving West to begin a new life. This movie is about a real story of a white 9 year old captive in the 1830's who was finally reunited with her family after 24 years but like many captives, was miserable in white society after so many years with an Indian family.  The Searchers is one of the greatest Western's every made so you won't go wrong watching it.  The music is also good and John Wayne's performance is one of his best.

0670034711|1.0|When I purchased this book, the headline said 'Hardcover'. Upon it's arrival, it was a paperback! I do not buy paperback books so I am extremely displeased with this product and feel I was tricked. Even now to ensure I wasn't mistaken, I reviewed the purchase and it says hardcover. If the seller knew they had paperback inventory, they should not have listed it as hardcover. This is extremely dishonest.

0385738781|1.0|Considering my dislike for both The Maze Runner and The Scorch Trials, I seriously considering abandoning this series. However, the first two books in the series did pique my curiosity enough that I decided to read The Death Cure in order to find out a) why these group of children were subjected to such horrors and b) how WICKED could possibly hope to create a cure out of their struggles. Unfortunately, The Death Cure continued to use Thomas' lack of memories to keep the reader in the dark for most of the book, and then gave us the weakest explanation for a series' sequence of events I have ever had the misfortune of reading in a dystopian.<br /><br />In my review of The Scorch Trials, I commented on how Dashner's various plot twists seemed pointless, \\"like Dashner was just making things up as he went\\" giving the book \\"an almost careless and unplanned feel\\" and I hate to say it, but that feeling of meandering continues with The Death Cure. And then I finally realized what was happening to make me feel that way! Dashner has not written a layered tale.<br /><br />\\"Think back on those really satisfying endings. Those \\"AHA!\\" moments in a story when the final twist is revealed and the carefully laid-yet hidden!-clues are suddenly so obvious. All those connections you had missed were right before your nose the whole time!\\"<br /><br />Here, Susan Dennard is talking about a story having resonance, when different subplots are woven together to create one \\"deep, complex, echoing plot.\\" The Death Cure (and then I guess I would also argue, The Scorch Trials) lacks resonance. While Newt's subplot gave his journey a definitive conclusion, it did nothing to further the main plot. I felt the same about the note he had given Thomas; I was hoping it would contain information that would explain something, anything. Or that it would give Thomas the information he needed, during a pivotal moment, to outsmart WICKED. Unfortunately, it proved to be merely a plot device to create suspense and intrigue. The same argument could be made with the tension between Thomas and Theresa; the words left unspoken between Thomas and Theresa were used to keep the readers in suspense. By the end of The Death Cure, when she had given us no new insight into the motives or history of WICKED, I realized that her subplot also did nothing to further the main plot. But the biggest disappointment when it came to subplots was Thomas' refusal to get his memories back. I kept waiting for that \\"AHA!\\" moment Susan talked about, where the reasons behind Thomas refusing to get the answers he was looking for made sense. For the moment where it was revealed that WICKED had been lying, or that there was some purpose to Thomas being kept in the dark. Unfortunately, it was also used as just another device to keep the reader in the dark and did nothing to move the main plot forward (if anything, it held it back!)<br /><br />So after hundreds of pages where it felt like we were merely spinning in circles, as nothing was connecting and nothing was being done to actually defeat WICKED, you could say that I was ready to completely throw in the towel when Thomas started considering helping WICKED with their next round of trials.<br /><br />\\"For some reason, Thomas couldn't get Janson out of his head. Could going back really be a way to save [name removed]? Every part of him rebelled against the idea of returning to WICKED, but if he did go back, and was able to complete the testing...\\"<br /><br />Seriously? My frustration with Thomas was only increased when it was finally revealed how the trials were supposed to have found a cure. Here's where things get slightly spoilery. Considering that the brain, or killzone, is the area that the Flare attacks, the doctors of WICKED decided that a map of the killzone would lead them to a cure. So they rounded up the brightest kids they could find, most of whom were immune to the effects of the Flare with a couple of non-immunes as variables, and put them through various trials in order to watch their brain activity. Why the trials needed to be as barbaric or dangerous as they were, was never explained. Why the trials only tested children, was never explained. Why the doctors couldn't have gotten the same kind of data from simulated experiences, was never explained. Considering what those children were put through, many of whom didn't make it out with their lives, for the explanation to be so lacklustre is an insult to my intelligence as a reader.<br /><br />On top of my frustrations with Dashner's lack of resonance or resolution, I also had to suffer through some of the worst writing of the series. I actually lost count of the amount of times Dashner started a sentence with (or some variation of) \\"Thomas knew they had no choice but to...\\"  It made Thomas unaccountable for many of his actions, as he was always being forced into making an impossible decision. There were also some truly awkward phrases, which forced me to re-read several sections in order to make any sense of it. One example would be this line, during one of the many action scenes where Thomas is somehow able to overpower several more experienced fighters:<br /><br />\\"He blocked the next punch with both of his forearms, then threw both fists up and at Janson's face, connected.\\"<br /><br />I had to read that sentence out loud to my husband to ask him if I was just being picky, or if it actually didn't make any sense.<br /><br />I'm not even going to touch on the characters; I found them as flat and dull as ever, with most of them being quite interchangeable.<br /><br />In short, The Death Cure lived up to its predecessors by being a mixed bag of unconnected plots, poor decisions and weak resolutions.m through various trials in order to watch their brain activity.

B0088W6Y7K|5.0|although it was short lived the final battle against the ZPM hive ship is just intense to watch. it would have been awesome if the episodes showed more of that ship tearin it up all the way to the milky way a little more.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I like this one better than the 1st one, but the first one was almost as good...Cant wait for the 3rd one.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is even better than Temple Run. There's a whole lot more to do, and you're not required to spend real money. The only bad thing I have to say is that the ad pop-up at the menu is a little annoying, but overall, I'd recommend this game.
B000QDA7OU|4.0|I have seen this several times before.  I still enjoy watching it.  Audry Hepburn is one of my favorite people and actors. she plays a person of intellect and character and so finds herself in a struggle difficult to endure.  it is easy to relate to,  whatever choices one makes in life.  the struggle that is the essence of this movie.  we all must come to terms with ones inner struggles and as with the Nun Story the struggle is torturous an painful. it was her father who knew her choice would be difficult because of her nature and character. and as in life it was less than happy ending.
B008VBYN80|4.0|You run out of energy real quick but the rest is absolute awesome I just wish you could have your own avatar to see what king you'd be
0930289234|5.0|Nough said!!! Will purchase more from this author. It is very well written from start to finish. Also for those that have seen the movie, it plays out almost the same. Awesome story!!!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Well done!  Good characters.  Great story line. Very creative. Vivid descriptions, you can really get inside the book.  Highly recommended.
B009IUH1N2|5.0|This game kept me stressed out, but still fun. With most games you are trimmed on how fast you can complete a course. With this game speed is the challenge besides the obstacles in your way. Pay at attention,your libel to miss something or get run over!
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Richard Dawkins is one of the intellectual giants of our time. This is the sort of stuff that our kids should be taught in school instead of the religious doctrines which serve to stifle thinking
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I love this game! I play it every day,I play when I cook,I play it when I watch tv,I even think I play it in my sleep! If you haven`t played this game give it a try,they even have an update 2! Enjoy!
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Amazing book with a great mystery and plot.  The children will love it.  Great read for all ages including adults
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|loved the choreography, creativity, music, designs, art, outfits, setting, and people(especially Moose).  It really inspired me (artistically), I would watch it again
B00340ESIS|5.0|I've been trying to write a good screenplay for a long time, Blake Snyder's simple and clear way of explaining things really helped me look at my scripts in a whole new way.  It's easy to read and fun!  His straight forward way of explaining things not only makes sense, but more importantly I feel like I can apply it to my own work.<br /><br />This book is awesome!  I think it would be helpful for any script writer of any skill level.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I never got it intsalled. I think it's the Coby tablet's fault. I just won't buy anymore S/W for it.<br /><br />I'll give you feedback, but I won't write a b ook.

1454901276|5.0|I see so many highly reviewed books on Amazon that, when read, are probably closer to a 3, according to my perspnal scale. This is the second book by this author that I have read and cannot wait for the third. It's a legitimate 5. I had to wait for it to be shipped from England to US but worth every minute of the wait. It's all here, great storytelling, developed characters, plot twists (for those that need them) and all set in the remote islands off the coast of Scotland. Give it a try, I promise it's better than the majority of the dreck you'll find people raving about. Enjoy!
B009MYARIK|4.0|I loved all of the \\"Shopaholic\\" books from Sophie Kinsella, but am almost weary of the Murphy's Law effect of her stories. Everything couldn't possibly always go that wrong, could it?  Still, a fun beach read!
B00AMS38YU|4.0|If you're a new yorker, you'll like this point of view for a bicyclist stand. Good action all throughout NY. Would def recommend this movie to anyone person though. It's a refreshing side of an action movie never before seen.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|My husband and I are both enjoying this CD. Great sound and great songs! A must have for any Beach Boys fan.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I loved the entire movie, it will keep you laughing! But my all time favorite part is about the chocolate pie!
B006LSZECO|5.0|The wife of a married couple that have had some marital problems in the past is missing. Immediately the police focus on the husband as the prime suspect for her disappearance . With the help of the missing wife the police gather evidence that make it look more and more like he was involved with her disappearance. In the mean time we are unaware of happening behind the scene that have a direct bearing on the book. The husband and the wife have their hang ups that helps keep the story suspenseful. My only minor criticism is I thought the ending wasn't as strong a the rest of the book. Overall I thought it was great read.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This is an astounding performance! It is the only version of the Phantom of the Opera I have seen on film and it fulfilled and surpassed every expectation! Christine's voice is amazing, the Phantom's mysterious and the rest of the cast is just awesome. It just draws you in and keeps you from the first song to the last. I don't feel like I'm watching a stage play, I feel like I am actually there. Will never watch any other version.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Lots of fun - too much need to pay to win touch to be a top app. Latest update has app working much better on a kindle fire.<br />,
B005LJJ3IU|3.0|This film was well-cast, well-acted and enjoyable. What I didn't care for or understand was how the characters arrived at murder as the only solution to their problems. When I first saw the preview, I was astonished that murder could be viewed as a trivial act. After watching it, I am still astonished.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|i cant wait for season four now i just finished watching season one two and three back to back and have to wait until august for season four not fair
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Dense with insight.  Beat book I've read in ages. Full of concrete examples to flesh out his ideas.  Buy this book no matter what field you're in.
B000002LKU|5.0|If you are a Mark Knophler fan then this is a must to have in your collection.  Laid back music and done very professional.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Enjoyed very much.  Requires some complex thinking and attention to detail.  Hints were good enough to keep you moving in the right direction.  Its a shame it wasn't a longer game.  Enjoyed very much and would recommend.
B000AQJPQE|5.0|Well made, Good value, great for kids, should be a toy that most children will use and remember for years to come and it is educational too.
B00847KFDS|5.0|When I first heard about this album coming out, my intitial response was, \\"Great, John Fogerty has fallen into the old trap of releasing a cheesy duets album of a bunch of rehashed CCR stuff.\\"  But to my pleasant surpise and astonishment, this album is outstanding and breathes a freshness into some of American's greatest rock and roll songs ever written.  What I enjoy the most is how each artist brings their own take to the song.  True, some like \\"Almost Saturday Night\\" don't stray too far from the original, but others like Bob Seger's take on \\"Who'll Stop the Rain\\" and Miranda Lambert and Tom Morello on \\"Wrote a Song for Everyone\\", showcase these songs in a different and refreshing light.  John's two new songs, \\"Mystic Highway\\" and \\"Train of Fools\\", prove that he is still loaded with a great deal of that songwriting magic.  I would be willing to bet that this CD has pumped new life into John Fogerty, and will also introduce him to a whole new audience of folks under the age of 40 who are only familiar with his better known CCR hit singles.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is fun. I love playing it! It truly is free. I definitely think you should download it as soon as you can.
B003H9MSPG|5.0|This is the one Nerf gun, my little guy had to have. And of course they don't make it anymore. It shoots far and and you can line up the sights to hit your target. If you can find it and its not outrageously expensive...go for it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I chose this rating because of my grandson, he loves this app among many, it keeps him occupied for about one-half
B00CL66FEQ|3.0|Nice, sweet movie. Not a lot of laughs beyond what you saw in the trailer, but Streisand and Rogen are believable as mother and son.
B0097HSS4M|3.0|I choose this  rating because it is just okay for me ,  this app was different , but.not one I would use everyday
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Everyone should watch this movie. It will make you want to call your mom! It's very funny, cute, and touching.
B004132HZS|5.0|A smart and witty re-inventing of Sherlock Holmes. Cumberbatch is a terrific actor, and the British really know how to re-tell their literature.
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|the photography was wonderful and the script with it was most informative.  Leaves you with a great understanding of these wonderful animals
B00BGIC4I6|2.0|I really like Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd but &#34;This is 40&#34;, was just so disappointing.  Not very many laughs and it was unrealistic (which I don't mind unrealistic if the movie is funny).
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am addicted to this show!  Can not wait for the next season to be available so I can watch more!
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Good selection of shapes, but automatically tells you to reshuffle when no moves are available, so you can always win.
B004IPPINW|5.0|Great perspective and one that I haven't really looked at. Everyone should read this book for global understanding. Love the ending.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I like Tom Cruise's acting in spite of the fact that I don't like him as a person. One two.
B00BWHZI0C|5.0|He should make the album into a movie. It's legit. You should buy it. It paints a vivid picture of what some youngsters go thru. The art of peer pressure reminded me of my high school days.
1616550414|5.0|I got into the Zelda games just a couple of years ago, at college I end the Legend Of Zelda, Ocarina of Time (1998), but I never return to this saga until I buy my Nintendo Wii.<br /><br />So I start by the end, with The Legend of Zelda, Skyward Sword (2011) I got immersed on that wonderful story and amazing game play.<br />So I use again Wii to complete the story of The Legend of Zelda, Twilight Princess (2006), and fall in love with these games, then I complete the story of The Legend of Zelda, The Wind Walker (2003), and each of this games are pieces of Art, the story is kind the same on all of them the realm of Hyrule in danger, and a current boy takes the role of the hero but the games are full of details, are fun for kids or adults (I'm 35 years old now) but each game has been great for me.<br /><br />So as soon as I knew that there is a book with the signature of the one and only Shigeru Miyamoto, I get it, so now I know what was behind this games and I'm really happy the book is in hard cover, bright paper and full of amazing pictures of the development of each of the games full of details beyond the making of the games.<br /><br />So now I'm looking forward to get and complete the remainder games of this saga that I haven't played yet.<br /><br />And this amazing piece of art is also inexpensive so there is no excuses to not get one.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|It had been quite a while since I'd seen this movie. It was just as good the second time around and we caught some of the things we'd missed the first time around.

B001NLL93W|4.0|I can not believe how gripping the books are and keep you guessing from the beginning. I wish I could read the series straight through without sleep or work, this is how good the storyline is.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Watched before going to theater to see newest movie to know the context for it. Enjoyed this movie<br />very much
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I always enjoy this author...the book is usually better than the movie. I have yet to see this one,but thought the book was great.

B005O7PXNS|5.0|I love Castle and needed to catch up on a few episodes I had missed.  I'm glad I was able to find those episodes.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This album's received a lot of mixed opinions, and I think it's because people make the mistake of expecting &#34;more of the same&#34; from Daft Punk. AKA &#34;another Discovery.&#34; Daft Punk has made it their motto to always try something new, and while not everyone will appreciate the &#34;disco&#34; direction they took with this album, I honestly think this is going to become one of my favorite albums of all time. There's so much love and admiration to be felt in every single track, and to me, there are no weak tracks here. There's something beautiful about each one. But those are my personal feelings towards it.<br /><br />If you're expecting &#34;drops&#34; or bombastic electric noise or 12 more tracks just like Get Lucky, look elsewhere. Daft Punk is taking risks and experimenting with new things here, and I think you need to go in listening to RAM with an open mind.<br /><br />I will also say this: I think this album requires patience. I don't say this very often, but I truly believe it's one of those albums that is best when you listen to it as a whole piece instead of 13 unrelated songs. Daft Punk loves to tell stories, and RAM tells the story of their robot personas older, more mature, experiencing heartbreak and love and happiness, learning to celebrate life, yearning for humanity. I'd like to think of RAM as the soundtrack for a movie that plays in your imagination. I also think it gets better after a few listens; I've seen countless fellow Daft Punk fans say they were confused for the first listen, and then gradually fell in love after one or two more listen throughs. So give this one a chance if you're not crazy about it at first!<br /><br />A lot of the songs are also dauntingly long, but unlike Homework's loops, most of these songs take very different turns when you listen to them all the way through, so please don't listen to the first half minute of those songs and skip them because it's not exciting right away. &#34;Touch ft. Paul Williams,&#34; in particular, stands at a daunting 8 minutes and 19 seconds, with a long intro referencing the boys' favorite movie, &#34;Phantom of the Paradise&#34; (coincidentally, also featuring Mr. Williams :)). But it has ended up being possibly my all time favorite Daft Punk song. It makes a gorgeous progression that you might not expect.<br /><br />All that being said about this album being extremely different, though, there's definitely nods towards their previous works, and certain songs are reminiscent of snippets of their past. If you're looking for more in the similar vein of Get Lucky, &#34;Lose Yourself to Dance&#34; (another collab with Pharrell and Rodgers) is a great tune. If you liked Discovery, &#34;The Game of Love&#34; is almost like a sequel to &#34;Something About Us.&#34; The closest thing to Homework or Human After All I can think of is perhaps &#34;Giorgio by Moroder&#34;; the sound that kicks in after Mr. Moroder's intro is a little bit like the electronic loops of those two eras. Motherboard's outerspacey arpeggios could definitely find a home in the Tron universe.<br /><br />When it gets down to it, I won't bother to describe this album track by track. I just really encourage you to find time to listen to the album as a whole, with an open mind. I don't know if this album is going to be a huge game changer in the trends of dance music, or whatever. All I know is that I've never cried while listening to 'dance' music before. There's something special here, and I felt a profound connection to it. I can only hope that others might be able to feel that connection as well.<br /><br />Ah, as a side note, the booklet is gorgeous. It has amazing diagrams of the boys' helmets in the inside. Those of you who have seen Electroma will see a little reference in there, too. :)
B001AGXEAG|5.0|Great DVD, a must own for any Beetlejuice fan. Made me feel like a little kid again. The special features also have a few episodes of the Beetlejuice Cartoon Series, which was a nice bonus.
B00ANY94A0|5.0|I saw on the Lego website that they plan to discontinue this so I'm glad we bought it. It's really cute and my daughters love Lego Friends.
B00005QW4K|3.0|Huge fan of this series and Bruce Campbell. The alternate ending blew my mind. I was a little disappointed it didn't come with a way to view the movie with the released ending.
B000JCQCW4|4.0|It is very graphic and dark. I did want to keep watching it till the end, and the end was definitely not a happy ending.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie as well as the bonus features. If you are a LOTR fan or Tolkein fan you will love this.
B0013ND30W|5.0|When you can get a four year old to make sure you that you don't interrupt a movie, you can tell they are dedicated to a movie. She actually loves all her Disney movies and being in Blu-ray even attenuates the viewing experience.
B0038OY6DW|5.0|Lost my copy, had to buy a new copy, and then found it after the new one arrived. Still happy to have to spare when I get on a Sherlock marathon.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I love Tom Hanks but this movie was hard to follow....very confusing.  I turned it off after about 30 minutes into the movie.
B004132I20|5.0|Bought this to complete my set so far. And of course, well worth the price.  Now if they only did bloopers...
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|I thought it was very funny!  I could totally relate!  My husband enjoyed it also...you should watch if you want a laugh.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There are so many great features.  It is easy to take to church or read at home with out searching for the chapters within a short period of time.
B008Q00KEW|5.0|I love the crossover tie-in the two Captains Kirk and Picard. Its like a ceremonial passing of the torch.  Its also ironic that both captains have had to endure their ships being totally destroyed on their watch.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love, love love, Bingo Blitz! My friends kept inviting me & I finally gave in. I am so glad I did, now I am addicted...It has everything Bingo, Slots, Free daily tournaments, collections to complete, and above all it's free! The graphics are constantly being updated for the greater good, and the best of all is the social interactions. You can chat & trade while your playing, and to tell you the truth, I have made the BEST friends just from the chat rooms. They have become more than Bingo Buddies, but friends I talk to every day...LOVE IT!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Hours of entertainment. Thoroughly satisfied with it. They too The time and made a great app for all ages young and old alike. And you don't need to spend money on game if you have patience.

B00785P2QC|3.0|Not a big fan of all the Facebook integration. Not ever y one wants to spam there wall with game reports. Other than that I love it! Still play... just a bit annoyed at times.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Kept us interested and guessing.  Good storyline and usually will watch anything with Actor Robert Duval in it - he is good
0547928246|5.0|reading this for the umpteenth time. it always seem like the first time. this time around enjoying it with the grandchildren. it is turning out to a most wonderful and extraordinary adventure, since they also have the added addition of the vhs & dvd.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|Just can't see little Tom Cruise as big ole' Jack Reacher.  Talk about miscasting. Should have been someone as least approaching the size.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|exceptional. the more i see of her acting the more intriqued i am by her. story line was good, great .
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Highly recommend this series. I have thoroughly enjoyed it over the years and the end does not disappoint! On to &#34;way of kings&#34;...
B008JFUO36|1.0|So yet again Tom Cruise made a dud film. Just when it couldn't get worse than Knight and Day...... It Did. This first fifteen minutes were strangely compelling. Then it turned into some sci-fi almost soap opera like film. Sadly the film could have been better. The plus note is the effects were pretty good and the ending wasn't too bad...... but this film really needed to be about 20 minutes shorter. I think would have benefited from that and maybe I would have given a higher review. As the beginning and the end were not bad it was the snore fest middle being so boring and predictable that killed it.<br />This will probally in time become a sci-fi cult classic.<br />Till then skip it....... For a good sci-fi film try this years amazing film Trance.
B00BF123WG|4.0|A really good story, and would get 5 stars except that several scenes were so dark that it was impossible to tell what was going on.  I am assuming this was a production choice and not a flaw in the Amazon video.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I wish I could give this a higher rating, but the app is not working.  I've triend to download multiple times, and it's not working at all.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Best book ok have read in the longest time movie was also full of action and mystery I recommend the

B007MNV5WU|5.0|I thank it is a good app I mane it is fun and puffle lanch<br />is fun to so take a look
B008GXHOFW|4.0|I am a fan of older games I have to admit but this game of many in it's price range keeps me pretty entertained. I also like that it is beautiful and intuitive once you get used to it's controls. GREAT ARCADE BUTTON PUSHING ACTION!
B00821OX98|5.0|This show is one of the few good shows on TV right now.  Looking forward to amazon adding season 3.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|I have owned this game for over six months. I love it more every time I play. It is constantly being updated. It has never crashed on my Kindle Fire HD. It is downright addictive! I have lost sleep more than once playing this terrific game. Best of all, it is entirely open ended play. This is the best money you will ever spend on a Kindle app. NOT TO BE MISSED!
1449410243|5.0|Quick. Bloom is a must for all at lovers and owners. Funny and light reading. I bought 2 so I could give one to a friend.
193700788X|4.0|I was so excited for this book to come out, and at the same time, it was very bittersweet knowing that this is the last Sookie Stackhouse book ever.  I have followed Sookie through all of her adventures, and they feel like my own.  The characters have become almost real to me, and I am sad that there will not be any more tales.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this last installment in the series.  There were more than a few twists, and I SO loved getting to see all kinds of old characters brought back for almost cameo appearances.  It was good to find out what characters like Quinn had been up to!  I liked the plot, even though it was predictable at some points,  and I also liked how everything was mostly tied up in the end.  No spoilers here, so I won't say what exactly happens, but at one point I think readers everywhere sighed a huge \\"Finally!\\"<br /><br />What I don't understand, quite honestly, is the criticism that the last couple of books have garnered.  Personally, I read the books in the Sookie Stackhouse series for the sheer fun of the read.  Sure they are fluff, but they are Fun - yes, with a capital F.  I am not looking for any philosophical literary depth, but for a great ride.  These books are that.  I have read other series by Charlaine Harris, and she has a great gift for story telling.  I hope she knows how much her fans enjoy her books.<br /><br />My rating on this book would be two thumbs up!  A great, fun read.
B008PZZV8S|5.0|Great movie with an all star cast set in Italy. The acting is fantastic and the cinematography is wonderful. Enjoy!
B0081336FO|5.0|My husband and I love this show...we would be elated to see some more seasons come along.  Great characters...superb acting!
B004L9MFM2|5.0|RR Martin is an author who combines intense plot and realistic characters in a very convincing manner... And all of this is packed with fantasy
B00499NHLC|5.0|This show is intelligent and entertaining.  The characters are believable and quirky.  You really have to think all the way through the show and the outcome isn't always what you would expect.
B00571F26Y|5.0|this book is a  glimpse into the theory behind the wheat belly diet. It needs to be read in conjunction with the wheat belly diet book to get the full picture. This one only gives a brief outline of the theory behind the effects of modern day wheat on the human body. Its a complex subject and does not give the indepth details as in the other book. However this book does give a simplified version of what changes you need to make to reap the rewards. Its definetly worth the time to read it.
B00CFQN12Q|5.0|Didn't disappoint yes it is fiction and over the top just the way it should be !!! Liked the Mercedes chase scene a bunch
B009G78EE2|4.0|The album is good and can be listened to more than once. However, only time will tell if the group is just a novelty.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|This book has you guessing what is going to happen from the get go.  It was hard pick which leading man you want America to end up with, as she has so much chemistry with both.  This book was a great follow up to The Selection; good job Kiera Cass!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Well written and readable, I was in a slump when it finally ended. Credits to Steve himself for giving access, unedited, to Isaacson.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a very believable book!  It is great a medical doctor wrote about his experience and provided the details about what caused his coma.  I know this happens to people because my sister was in ICU for 120 days waiting for a heart transplant and she went flat at least 4 times.  She had a very similar recollection of the near death experience.  I am now chanting to myself everyday the doctor's three phases about how loved all us are by God.  You will have to read the book to find out what the 3 phrases are....enjoy!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A fascinating first person account of one of an important historical event.  It also gives a lot insight into these special military professionals who have become an important part of our fight against terrorism.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|A classic!  Love how close the family is.  A genuine bond between sisters.  Storytelling at its best!  Loved this book and loved the movie
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Everybody knows about Harry Potter! I never read the books, but my fiance loved the movies! I had gone to see the last few films with him in theaters and ended up getting him this boxed set for Christmas! We have watched the collection several times and he still absolutely loves it! Glad I bought it for him!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has intense characters and nice outfits lol.These people look different my but kind a have the same advantages this product is amazing. I think everyone should try it's the best.Everyone can play its easy. DUCK ROLL JUMP it's easy.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|We love having amazon prime instant video! It is much better than Netflix since sometimes it would take forever to playback or go forward and buffering would take forever. But not w/ prime!
B004KPLVV8|5.0|I bougt this movie to complete my movie collection.  Bot me and my kids love this movie!!  I would highly recommend.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is fun and addicting. It has run great and has never given me any problems. I even got my hubby addicted to it!
B00BQI4AU6|4.0|Former Cinderella front-man Tom Keifer released his solo debut album in the spring of 2013. To say this album was a while in the making would be a huge understatement. I always liked Cinderella more than most bands of their genre, and had really high hopes for this album as well.<br /><br />People that gave this album an overwhelming five-stars must be bigger Tom Keifer fans than myself. This album is pretty good throughout, but it's not five-stars to me. I actually really dig most of the sounds Tom puts on the record; however, sometimes I feel like he ventures a little too far into the experimental territory. This isn't a terrible thing, but it kind of turned me off just the slightest bit. That being said, this is a worthy debut for the former Cinderella leader. Songs like \\"Solid Ground,\\" \\"Flower Song,\\" and \\"Mood Elevator\\" are the best of the bunch, but most of the rest are decent as well.<br /><br />If you enjoy Tom's voice and songwriting, you'll more than likely enjoy this album too. If you're looking for the resurrection of Cinderella circa 1989, better check elsewhere.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|The Scribblenauts games are really fun. Your imagination can run wild with no limitations (except for proper nouns). Its fun in the sand box to make a giant ape climb a small building, and shoot him in a biplane. Just don't make a nuke or a flood. No matter what you can't survive those. But mine won't install. It's not my storage capabilities or my kindle. It's the app. Reccomended, just had a bad experience myself.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a page-turning, clever, and original black comedy with plenty of twists.  Great for summer reading and escapism to read on vacation or your commute.
B0090RSYVG|5.0|I have it on my ID badge at work and it's really great.  He's my favorite, even though he's fighting my other 4 favorites.
B00138CYD4|5.0|This is a great mix of Santana music featuring some superb artists. This CD is a must have for Santana lovers.
B001L9OKZK|5.0|This book was required reading when I was in high school and I loved the story then as much as I do now.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|The large numbers make it eazy to use. Eazy to read and it has a good memory. I'd buy it
B0058O84G0|5.0|It is an excellent book! If you like history you will enjoy it very much.<br />Describes the war and way of living in a very Easy way...
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a funny and easy game to play. I feel like I got value for what I spent on it.
0345803493|5.0|The second installment of fifty shades is just as compelling as the first. This book is a must read! Thanks

0345803507|5.0|This is a well written book, very easy to read and follow. Can't put it down. This is a must read.
B001IAME78|5.0|Once again Marvel has combined science fiction in a present day scenario.  I like this type of film<br />producing.  It shows me where things could go if it were allowed by Almighty God.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Well acted, very interesting characters, excellent story line. I enjoyed season one very much and intend to watch more seasons.
B005H9B44A|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who's a science fiction buff.  I find there is an interesting<br />story line progressing.
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|Loved the action sceens story was all right! It went real fast from begining to end, leaving you wanting more!
B0054X3FQO|5.0|This is book I am sure would  benefit all young women. I only wish it was available 50 years ago.<br />Its a delightful read, very inspiring and  motivating.<br />Helps to believe in one self and know that you are important- who every you are and where you ever have come from.<br />You can achieve something good for you.<br />Never give up. and be kind to yourself. make your dreams come true.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|After update, pictures would not load. Use the Twitter app in the Dolphin Browser instead. Or don't update the Twitter app.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I use with a classic iPod and a Bluetooth speaker from Logitech.  I had my doubts, but it has proved very useful for traveling.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Store music in the cloud and device and stream on the road with Android, Amazon and iOS devices. Great if you don't have much room on your phone and your music is backed up in the cloud. Also works on PCs.
B00112GVFO|4.0|Caught this on Amazon Prime streaming video and really enjoyed it.  I don't remember hearing about this when it came out, wish I had as it's the kind of film that would be fun to watch on the big screen.  Lots of silly action and an improbable plot makes this a prefect viewing on a Saturday night.  Good old fashioned fun in action.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It was good.<br />It was weird at first but then I got the hang of it. Very good game!I wish that they would lower the prices on things but that's ok and I also wish that the energy was loose on the competition.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I picked this up as Amazon's free-app-of-the-day.  I had no idea the game existed.  It is a lot of fun and I am very pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable it was.<br /><br />I am a fan of Butterflies and Diamond Mine in Bejeweled, but otherwise don't care much for Bejeweled.  I played a lot of Zoo Keeper on the Nintendo DS, and have been a fan of Puyo Puyo since I first discovered it in 1997.  Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure for Nintendo DS was a good example of a game I really enjoyed because it took the matching puzzle genre and combined it with a platformer.  This game is far more basic, the gameplay doesn't necessarily require you to ever do anything but match three of a kind, but the ability to add strategy to what you're matching when is a nice touch.  I thought it would remind me more of Puzzle Quest, but both the presentation and gameplay are significantly more different than I initially imagined.<br /><br />The only downside of the game is that there's not a lot of replayability once you've beaten it, but for $1.99, and with the ability to wipe your data and start over, I think it's got more than enough content for it's price, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Puzzle Quest and/or Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure, or just wants some RPG elements in their match-three puzzlers for their Kindle Fire.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This game is a fun and cool game I personally love it,everybody should at least try it I think you'll like it
B006M4F67A|3.0|Good mahjong but a little glitchy and doesn't control well on smaller screens.  Worth getting, but I hope the developer continues to revise it a little.
032147404X|5.0|Cover to cover brief descriptions on how to capture many classic camera challenges.  I am reading this with a highlighter in hand.  Each situation he describes boils down to one or two pointers that will either help you capture a superior image, or keep you from ruining a good shot.  He writes with a light touch of humor and tons of knowledge gained through experience and success.
B004P1JEWU|3.0|The first book of the series was tightly written, fast paced and introduced a good range of characters and plot line to keep the story moving along.<br />As I wade my way through the 4th and 5th books I can see George Martin has fallen in to the same trap that most successful authors fall into. they think that every storyline they create is fantastic and must be recounted in all it's convoluted style.<br />I wish editors were as firm on the fourth and fifth books as they are on the first.<br />I have given up reading Tom Clancy and Robert Jordan because they couldn't seem to write a story without a lot of extra 'fluff'.<br />Having said that, I can hardly wait for the 6th book to see how it ends.
0061433063|5.0|I have followed Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men through all four books with great enthusiasm.  I'm a great fan of Terry Pratchett anyway but these make me sad that I have no granddaughter to give them to.
B000ICRKLM|5.0|I love this show because it showed how people from all backgrounds get along and help and work together no matter the circumstances. How no matter what their differences were they became a family. I just Love David Hewlett as Dr. McKay ( my favorite character).
B005LAIGPU|3.0|This flick is a good 1 time watch. That is all I did with it. I can't see watching it over and over again. Since this movie, I have adopted the Redbox/Netflix rule of watching movies which I haven't seen and then purchasing them later. This wasn't what the previews made it out to be, but I still thought it was an &#34;eh&#34; type movie.<br /><br />Would recommend watching it on Amazon, iTunes, Netflix, or Redbox (or now premium cable channels) before purchasing.
B00COGY6YO|3.0|For the content... I get it, LEGO movies are commercials but since I already forked over the money for the game, I expected at least a different story or an extension to the story you get from the game.<br /><br />In the end, it made the kids happy, and that's what really counts but I wasn't impressed.
B00C25TCZ0|5.0|Ricky Warwick is just fantastic with his delivery and writing on this one! The band is great and Scott Gorham is one the greatest guitarist ever! Phil would be so proud of this!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very cute & fanciful. Allow yourself suspension of disbelief. A Very fairy tale romance that makes for a fun read.
0451208706|5.0|Excellent Ken Follett readings!!  The plot goes along in excellent fashion.  The ending is one which is a surprise and unexpected!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|even without the upgrade it fits my needs-to wake me up!;) get it!!! thanks alarm clock app! ill probably be upgrading soon!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The case fits a Kindle Fire very well. The stand works as advertised and the case will give our Kindle some protection if dropped
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Instant teleportation to the places, people and events in our individual lives, unique to each: tha epitome of poignancy..  well able to stand the tests of time..
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Batman is a good movie, obviously we all think about the Dark Knight, but this one is definitely worth watching, not as good though.
0316056871|3.0|I'm only 19 and I'm just some guy, so here's my review..<br /><br />Well i love Tina Fey so i gave her an average of three stars just because. As mentioned, she deserves an awesome amount of college points for her big lengthy vocabulary, but that in no way factored within my rating. There were times where i read and came across some type of endorsement for some product. The way she introduced the first one in the beginning of the book i did think it was funny. But the second or third time around it was a bit annoying. Here and there i could see jokes where she evidently just tried too hard to make me laugh, but maybe it would make an average soccer/hockey mom laugh but not me.<br /><br />Overall it was entertaining. I did not \\"burst out laughing\\" but i did chuckle throughout the book. I sure do laugh a lot more when I watch 30 rock.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Couldn't hide behind everyone talking about how Ted is all the rave for watching on a late night with friends and a couple drinks.<br />Well watched it without friends and drinks and it was ok. Im sure if i had a few friends and some drinks it would have made it a little better. Boy humor.
B009LAP96U|5.0|The plot, acting, and intrigue of this show are riveting! I'm hooked!!! Purchasing season 2 now! I love Emily, Nolan, and Jack and I couldn't help but feel something for Victoria, I wonder how things will go on without her?!?
1936608898|5.0|Over 7 years ago I was celebrating my first pregnancy and realized that throughout the first trimester I was quite ill. My body began to stop digesting food, and it progressively got worse throughout the next 6 months. Doctors didn't have a good idea of what was going on with my body and I quickly decided that I was simply allergic to being pregnant. Fast forward to the end of the pregnancy and a seemingly uneventful early cesarian and I was hoping that my tummy troubles would quickly resolve. After quickly loosing more than the baby weight, and then needing a blood transfusion 6 months after delivering my son my husband began to realize that there was something else going on. Doctors began to go through a stream of invasive procedures to determine that I had Ulcerative Colitis. There I began taking a slew of medications, and still not feeling well enough to go on with a normal life. At times I wouldn't be able to leave the house for several days due to a flare up.<br />Fast forward four years later, another child, and still going to the hospital for intravenous  fluids during flare ups and taking a slew of medicines that I would show resistance to and then be prescribed another slew of medicines and I would have to say that the quality of my life, along with my amazing husband and two children, was not that amazing. Everything revolved around where the restroom was and how I was feeling. I was admitted to the hospital during an extreme flare up and was told that some of the medicine I was taking was actually causing my pancreas to not function properly, and I was to stay for a week, no foods, just intravenous liquids. I owe the doctor that was observing me for helping me see things a little clearly. He asked if I had any food allergies, and then told me to try the pasta dinner and see how it affected me. Within an hour I was having another flare. I cut gluten and began to see changes. The gastroenterologist clearly stated numerous times that diet cannot relieve mysymptoms and that I was not going to be able to follow a strict diet, that simply going gluten free was not manageable and that I should continue a regime of medications, recommending a chemotherapy based prescription next.<br />I began doing more research and experimenting with tapering my medicines and following a gluten free, vegetarian based diet. Per the advice of another doctor that said that meat products are too hard to digest and my system was already strained. Still I wasn't seeing results and still facing the regular flare ups that resulted in hospital stays and intravenous fluids. Then I began doing research into the Paleo diet, and reading through Robb Wolfs Paleo Solutions was a start to realizing that maybe all the processed food I was eating as a vegetarian was part of the problem.<br />Then I read It Starts With Food, and began to realize some of the issues that I had with food, and how the processed items, and other grain products maybe triggering the same type of symptoms as gluten.<br />After about a year of sticking with a pretty strict Paleo lifestyle I can say that I feel like I have control over my life again. As long as I am strict with eating clean there is no need for medication, I haven't been to the hospital for an IV in over a year. I am an avid cross fitter, and even went snorkeling with my family this morning. I have tried on numerous occasions to have my mother read the book, she has celiac, but is in denial that she can feel better! Eventually I will win her over.<br />I want to thank you for making the Whole 30 manageable and realistic, and for providing resources to further my journey into wellness. Yes I still have a disease; however, I am not over medicated with no results. I am proactive with the food that I eat to maintain a lifestyle that is worth living. My children, husband, and I eat clean and it feels good as a mother and wife to know that I am setting them all up for a healthy future.<br />This book is life changing.
B007HV93CQ|5.0|While I wouldn't say this is better than &#34;Ethnicity&#34;, &#34;Truth of Touch&#34; has some beautiful gems on it.<br />There are a few average songs that are forgettable, but that somehow makes the good ones stand out that much more.<br />In a world of &#34;me too&#34; Classical and New Age musicians, Yanni still stands tall.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I wanted this every since I saw it on PBS. I enjoyed it thoroughly Because it is as close as you can get to seeing it on Broadway with out going to the theater
B004G6009K|5.0|This movie makes me want to believe that Disney has found that spark again that it had in it's golden days and the one it had during it's 90's renaissance.<br />Likable characters, a cruel villain with just a touch of morals (probably just acting) that almost make her pitiable and a classic fairy tale.<br />I've waited for Rapunzel since I was a child and even though this changes the tale around, it's still one of the best Disney movies in my opinion. I was very skeptical when I heard it was going CG instead of 2d, but Rapunzel's hair couldn't look better! While I'll never stop loving the 2d Disney films, if these CG ones are made with the same quality as Tangled, I'm okay with a few of them being made too.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This was a very informative real life story that pretty much put me side by side with Jacee. I felt every ache and pain she suffered. Real good book although very Sad! I found myself mad, sad and crying at times. Only time I felt ok was when she was free from those scum bags!
B003NX76BM|2.0|I generally like Nora Robert's books but this one does not hold my interest.  Maybe I need to move on to another author for a little while.
B005M5OSBK|5.0|I went to a concert Pink Martini performed with the city's symphony orchestra and the line to purchase their CDs was so long I went home and immediately ordered a few on Amazon.  I had never heard them before that night.  The CDs are not with a symphony orchestra, so are a more intimate sounding experience, but no less enjoyable.
B0095P29EG|5.0|It is campy like a lot of the movies made from comic books but a great story. You'll like it.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Not your father's &#34;Star Trek&#34;, but a very active thrill ride.  I do miss the Roddenberry humanity in the franchise, though.  The character that comes off best in the film is actually Captain Christopher Pike.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|Reading through some of the one and two star reviews, I found myself able to agree with many of the criticisms. Incoherent plot, failure to provide any reasonable explanation for the  situation into which the characters are thrust, and, oh,  many more; nonetheless, I  was grabbed by the movie and involved in the characters if not in the plotline. In other words,  the whole was much better than its parts or the sum of its parts.  That's good enough for me. Clive Owen was entirely credible even if his character was inexplicable, Michael Caine and Julianne Moore performed ably in small parts, and a number of people I never heard of and cannot remember by name  were quite good in their roles (particularly the mother of the first child to be born into the world in, I think it was, 18 years). Despite the murkiness behind the actions, all the viewer has to know is that  no new children are being born, Government military is  rounding up refugees and mistreating them, rebels are set on engaging in violent action to defeat the military and free refugees, and, in the midst of all this, the mother-to-be, now in the hands of the rebels, who want to use her baby symbolically, thinks she is  on  her way to an outside organization which would care for both she and her baby. It is never very clear why anyone is doing what they are doing, but with this kind of program to the  action, it hardly makes any difference.<br />Not recommended for people who need all their i's dotted and t's crossed. Most of the rest of us stand a good chance of enjoying the action centered on the hero seeking to assure the success of the mother and child's efforts to get out of Great Britain and into the hands of caring people.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Pretty fun game for the kindle, I just started. I like city building games which implement objectives and goals. Graphics are up to par.
B001C08RHA|5.0|the service was great the video was in wonderful condition, the movie was what I expected why buy new movies when you can get them here in great condition
B00846REIS|5.0|Awesome book. Although it's like 50 shades this book has a better plot and more depth. Everyone enjoy.  And oh yea. It's sexy as bell
B003UYV08E|5.0|The service was great as usual and the movie was for my nephews they loved it. they had never seen the iron man series and wanted to before they went to the new one
B00CBKLO52|2.0|Okay..it was free so I guess it is okay. If you are into RC planes it might be fun but overall it didn't do much for me.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I love how the personal story lines are woven through the weekly episodes of legal cases. This cast has chemistry. I love the characters, some I love and some I love to hate.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|The kindle bundle in itself is an alright product. Like everyone has said, this is all 4 books combined into 1 ebook file. I haven't had as many issues with navigating through the book as others, but I had to \\"clear my furthest page read...\\" when I accidentally jumped to other parts of the book.<br /><br />The price is unbeatable, but you do lose out on other features available if you were to buy them seperately, mainly whispersync. There is no clear disclaimer stating that whispersync would not work between the bundle kindle book versions and audible books. Even discussing with customer service, they were unable to have this feature work unless the books were bought separately. A bit disappointing for books this large.<br /><br />Otherwise, format of the bundle isn't a big problem. All 4 books in one makes the kindle book a little more daunting as you don't feel like you're making progress through the book (I know it seems silly, but I like to track my progress in finishing a book instead of all 4 books collectively). I don't think I will buy another bundled version of kindle books in the future if they are combined as one book.
B00708LBFS|1.0|Unless you are an historical buff, this piece is worthless, it is a little over a minute long....it's not the complete song.
B000Y7U98C|4.0|Great space movie, I wish I had seen it at the movie theatres ... Very imaginative simple story with great visuals and soundtrack .
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I love jack reacher!! I wish I knew someone like him. The story is riveting from beginning to end. Anything with jack reacher in it I read.
B005WMADYE|5.0|I loved this anime, although silly here and there the race scenes keep you on the edge of your seat and cheering for the faster car.
B008GGA5EQ|5.0|This is a stunningly riveting book. The heroine, a bored London girl who has discarded her boyfriend, goes on holiday to La Gomera, one of the Canary Islands, where she learns to discard all inhibitions as she is initiated into a much greater self-awareness and sense of reality through a string of brilliantly-described and at times quite brutal sexual encounters. Through swimming out naked to a small island she leaves behind her old self and values and, like Columbus, embarks on a voyage of self-discovery into the unknown. Captured by a gang of Arab smugglers (whose main occupation is smuggling Africans into Europe) she finds pleasure in being abused and taken against her will by a succession of swarthy, muscular, turbaned Arabs. She becomes stripped of her past and thus her own identity, and in effect becomes a nothing at the mercy and indulgence of the men she is in thrall to. She ends up with a sheikh, Samir, every Western girl's wet dream, and becomes freed from all barriers and restraints. She lives a reality that in her western decadence she could only have dreamed of; she becomes her sheikh's willing concubine, glorifying in her subjugation and abuse. There are a succession of love-making scenes, graphically and expertly described, often violent, always fulfilling, and not just with her beloved sheikh, but others too, including Maysoon, a beautiful belly-dancer. She joins the harem, initiated into it with her body being branded by being given the clan markings, and described in gruesome, brutal detail. In the end she does leave North Africa and returns to her chic London life, but it is not only her body which has been given something of a violent sheikh, but, in fact, her whole awareness of her sexual and inner self. Breath-taking!
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|Its a very interactive story book, and its for mature 4 year olds, what im saying is, it may have some scary scenes they aren't too bad. But, like to be intrigued and use our imagination, the ENDING IS PERFECT!~ MUST GET THIS!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is superb acting!  A period piece, soap opera, feels like a look behind closed doors that you can't get enough of.
B00CJ32S74|5.0|This soundtrack marries beautifully with a bold interpretation of Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. How well the hiphop infused, jazz driven music with HUGE artists works with the bigger-than-life stylistic choices of Baz Luhrman is pretty incredible. Watch the film, listen to this soundtrack, be open to fresh take on one of the greatest novels of all time.
B00847KFDS|2.0|One look at Fogerty's unflattering expression on the front cover pretty much says it all.  John you know we love you, but what convinced you to do this???<br /><br />It seems we are cursed every few years with another useless \\"duet album\\" that consists of a real deal legend {Ray Charles, Tony Bennett, Lionel Richie, etc.} sharing the microphone with a selection of inferior modern day stars that anybody who values REAL TALENT should care less about.  John Fogerty is one of my musical heroes, a man whose music represents everything real and right about American music. For reasons obvious to anyone born before 1980, I am certainly NOT a fan of any cookie-cutter mainstream record company puppets that have cursed the Billboard charts from 1992 to the present day.  The last thing I want to hear is one of these artists performing with a true legend who they pale in comparison to.<br /><br />Fogerty certainly \\"wrote a song for everyone\\" in his 50 years as a music maker, but that doesn't mean that \\"everyone\\" can do justice to his great songs.  As a Fogerty fan, what qualities does John represent that I look for in the music I love??  How about honesty, originality, musicianship, great songwriting, powerful singing, a great stage show with no gimmicks, being true to who you are, and most of all, \\"TALENT\\"....that dirty six letter word that is no longer acceptable in the mainstream music scene of 2013.<br /><br />With the exception of the legendary Bob Seger, what do any of these guest artists have to do with the timeless qualities that Fogerty stands for???<br /><br />John, if you really think the abomination known as KID ROCK has any business sharing a mic with your legendary self, you might as well choose ME to sing on your next CD.  I promise you that my unknown 36 year old fanny could do a more respectable job on any Creedence song than that overexposed, arrogant joke rapper who never fails to make his presence known on everybody's CD from Lynyrd Skynyrd to Jerry Lee Lewis.  If the useless Kid Rock merits a spot on a John Fogerty album, you better include Britney Spears and Taylor Swift too!  Why were they left off the roster considering the other record company puppets that were chosen for this project??  I can totally hear Britney destroying \\"Born on the Bayou\\" with the same degree of horror as Kid Rock.  WHY NOT?<br /><br />This CD is obviously another attempt to \\"introduce\\" the American Idol generation to a great music legend who should need no introduction.  If you don't know who Creedence or John Fogerty is, you don't know good music!  Sadly, most Americans born after 1980 wouldn't know a great song or singer if it slapped them in the face. As long as Kid Rock keeps showing up on every CD produced by a major artist in the 21st century, they never will.<br /><br />I can't help but wonder if that infamous corporate dictator known as Simon Cowell {pop music's modern day Hitler} actually assisted with the selection of guest singers on this CD.  To take a stand for the REAL DEAL, let me suggest a list of REAL DEAL TALENT that SHOULD have graced the line-up for this album instead.<br /><br />1.  Tony Joe White {the king of swamp rock along with Fogerty}<br /><br />2.  Los Lonely Boys {the most talented young American band on the scene today! John has to love these guys if he cares about new talent}<br /><br />3.  ZZ Top<br /><br />4.  Leslie West<br /><br />5.  Bonnie Raitt<br /><br />6.  Eric Clapton<br /><br />7.  Bruce Springsteen {check out Bruce and John's killer live duet of Fortunate Son on youtube.  THAT should have been the duet here instead of Foo Fighters!}<br /><br />8.  Joe Bonamassa<br /><br />9.  Travis Tritt<br /><br />10. Ronnie Milsap {Yes, this criminally overlooked legend can belt a rock n' roll tune with the best of them!}<br /><br />Now THAT is a line-up of talent I would spend my money on without a second thought!  John, did it ever cross your mind to include any of these beloved performers, all of whom wipe the floor with any of the inferior duet partners chosen for this CD??  If anyone reading this would rather hear this selection of modern corporate puppets over the ten superior artists listed above, you've been watching more American Idol than John Fogerty lately.  If you love modern country music {correction: Nashville bubblegum pop}, or Karaoke Idol contests, this is the CD for you.  If you value REAL TALENT like me {and I know most music fans under 35 do not}, do yourselves a favor and see JOHN CAMERON FOGERTY live at a venue near you.  This 68 year old STUD has lost nothing with age, and makes today's contrived superstars sound like the amateurs they are.<br /><br />I sat in the audience as John rocked the roof off the Arizona state fair last October.  The crowd ate it up!  This man can belt them out and rock the guitar like he could 40 years ago!  Needless to say, the guest stars featured on this CD cannot compare to an aging John Fogerty who can STILL sing, write, and play circles around anybody on the charts in 2013...<br /><br />Yes, my review seems a bit harsh, and I mean no disrespect to the living legend that IS John Fogerty, truly one of the best American artists of the last 50 years.  It's just that my ever-growing disdain for modern cookie-cutter \\"ear torture\\" on the charts today is so overwhelming that it's all I can do to keep a knife from my throat whenever I come within earshot of Top 40 radio or American Idol.  When I hear a Fogerty record, the blade suddenly leaves my neck as I scream \\"THANK YOU GOD FOR REAL MUSIC!!  Please Lord, AVENGE ME FROM THE WRATH OF SIMON COWELL......AND KID ROCK!!\\"<br /><br />Somehow by the grace of God, John \\"The Legend\\" Fogerty lives on in this endless nightmare called mainstream music in 21st century America.  Keep on keeping on Mr. Fogerty, and can we all forget about this new CD as quickly as possible as we hope for the NEXT Fogerty solo effort where no inferior guest stars are needed.  What IS needed on the charts today is some REAL ARTISTS like John Fogerty...like hell needs ice water!  The CD earns two stars from me, one for Fogerty and one for Bob Seger.  Enough said.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is one of the best British series ever made. I would recommend to anyone that has an affinity for traditional British life.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|People keep saying that this book was bad and the story line was bad etc. When i read books i'm not looking for the next classic i'm looking for something that will keep my interest. This book does what it's supposed to it keeps you hooked throughout the entire book. I absolutely loved it and read it in less than a day. I couldn't do anything else. This book was amazing and i would recommend it to anyone who just wants a good read!
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|Great story, special effects, and acting.  The actors were cast perfectly.  I'm pretty sure I've watched this movie more than 5 times. :)
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Cloud Atlas was to hard to follow. I didn't really know much about the movie before I watched it but I figured with Tom Hanks and Halley Berry how bad could it be? The answer is &#34;PRETTY BAD&#34;!
B00CKR63F2|5.0|Can't wait to read more about the people and the area the book was in. I thought it was well writen.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I liked both of the main actors in this movie but had only seen a few of their movies. I will be on the look out for more from either one. This movie was great fun to watch and it made me cheer for the happy ending. Good Job!
B0080M3OGW|2.0|Street and de Niro are great actors who do their best with a poor script. The relationship of the two lead characters is finally uninteresting and whimsical, since they aren't developed enough for the audience to see why they should fall in love.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|I liked the way this movie got right to the point. It made the tragedy of a tsunami so real. I knew what the movie was supposed to be about but was amazed at how real it all appeared. This was well worth watching.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Not as good as his best, but still gripping in that morally grey world that Le Carre is so good at depicting.
B005HED08I|5.0|Awesome to go back and see the original. Defiantly worth an Amazon Prim account. The remastered makes it ton better too!
B00992CF6W|1.0|I hate this game you should really just get survival craft  .first when on creative you can't see any mobs at all it just all sucks get sc..
0375851569|4.0|I bought this for my 2.5 Yr old son. It's a perfect book to teach them rhyming words and vocabulary. But, cannot give in their hands as it's not a board book.
0375434526|5.0|I am an unabashed, Dan Brown fan: in this novel, the often-misunderstood organization known as &#34;Freemasonry&#34; is explored and serves as the context for the continuing adventures of &#34;Robert Langdon,&#34; Symbologist-Extraordinaire, played out in the Masonic and Scottish Rite-rich history of our nation's capitol.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Tangled is...entertaining...funny...great. I purchase this book not really anything about the story and got much more then I what I hoped for.  This is story refreshing in a time when all books seem to be going the FSOG route (not that there is anything wrong with that) its great to come across something different. The story is told from Drews p.o.v, a guy who thinks he has the perfect life and can get anything he wants until he meets Kate. A co-worker who is going to give him a run for his money and let him see that no matter how perfect he thinks his life is, it could always get better. A sweet romantic comedy this book will have have you laughing and smiling from beginning to end.
B00CDFWJIG|4.0|I read the first book which is what this movie is based on.Not much into\\"TEEN\\"books but I do recommend this one.Haven't read the other's in the series but am NOW interested.The movie was great,had awesome CGI.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't bring  myself to put down this book. Sad to have finished this trilogy but eager to find an equally good book.
034580404X|5.0|These books were really good. I am glad i got all three books right away. They are an easy and quick read.
B0049VZ222|5.0|This is such a good show! You won't be let down by this at all, it has a great story line and the cliff hangers will keep you hooked.
B001NCQSDM|4.0|Badge and I'm So Glad are fabulous, and the rest of the tracks are merely great. As a farewell album, you couldn't ask for better.  Cream went out at the top of their game, and left me wanting more!
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Very easy to stay on this way of eating.  The day of the fast is challenging for sure and it is only one day!  than I take a couple days of normal eating then one more day of the fast.  There are so many choices for food out there that I have a nice program of soup and fish for my meals on those days.  I fast on Mondays and Thursdays so I have my weekends free to wine and dine and I have lost 15 pounds in 9 weeks.  I feel great an am getting into clothes that I have missed for a long time.
B0088T3B0G|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a while.  Plot twists, interesting characters, and a great surprise ending combine to make this a really fascinating study.<br /><br />The story of a gang of robbers is told through the voice of Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) from the time they form until the &#34;present&#34;.  The characters are interesting, and there is enough action to keep things going along at an exciting pace.  The group starts out in New York, and end up in California trying to break up a drug deal on a freighter (not giving up any detail here).  Along the way, they become involved with a shadowy crime kingpin (a Moriarty-like character, for Sherlock Holmes fans).  Chased by the cops, customs, and others, they realize that they may be in deeper than they anticipated, and start accelerating towards a suspenseful conclusion.<br /><br />Great performances from Spacey and  Gabriel Byrne.
B000QUUD60|5.0|Great DVD for all fans if Elvis. The outtakes was hilarious. You actually see Elvis eating a hamburger and a piece of the bun was stuck in the right corner of his mouth. Added scenes are fantastic.
B004ELSDZK|5.0|Yes, just wow. I could not believe that something like this existed. This is a nice puzzle game like none other! As for levels that stump you, you can go to a different puzzle and solve the other one later.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Gru, his mimions and those little girls have our hearts. We all enjoy watching it. Three thumbs up. Great movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a really amazing app. it's even free!!! This has been entertaining me for hours... or at least until my kindle fire runs out of battery. This is gonna keep entertaining me for days (or hours) to come!
B005OYKIJ0|5.0|This franchise is an action packed series that never leaves you disappointed.  GREAT CAST, AWESOME STUNT ACTION AND PLENTY OF FAST CARS. It was by far the best of the film series and I really loved the others.  This is a MUST see.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Fast and Furious Film Series to anyone who loves fast actions and cars.<br /><br />I HAVE NOW SEEN FF6....can't believe it toped Fast Five, but somehow they just keep building the suspense of these films and leave you hungry for more at the end.  I HOPE THEY CAN CARRY THIS FILM FRANCHISE FOR SEVERAL MORE FILMS.  The Rock and Vin together is dynamic and the chemistry with the cast spell binding.  Gotta watch them all.
0307887960|4.0|I purchased this book to gain insight into another low carb system and not so much for a quick weight loss.  I like the explanation given for why this type of diet works though Dukan.
B000J2BRQU|5.0|This franchise is an action packed series that never leaves you disappointed. Tons of fast cars and actions. Story line is good and leaves it open for the next film.  I highly recommend the Fast and Furious Film Series to anyone who loves fast actions and cars.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|I read the graphic novel when I was 14 or so, this movie sticks to the gn, I can't wait to watch part 2. If you like Frank Miller and Batman you'll love this film. Enjoy
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|I've been watching Arnold movies for quite some time and with this movie I wasn't expecting much. However I was pleasantly surprised at how the movie portrayed Arnold as the older man he is. There's some good humor in it that mixes well with hard to believe stunts. I like it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is such a good-looking app,it tells you everything you need to know about your battery with just a click,definitely a must get for your kindle fire or kindle fire hd,I'm upgrading to pro now.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can't wait to begin the next series of the Silo saga! These chapters seemed to fly by as I read about Jules, Lukas, Bernard, Solo and my favorite, Holsten.  I wanted to know how they came to be in the silo; the true purpose of the cleanings; and how the outside world became so toxic.  This novel isn't a break-neck action thriller and it captured my interest slowly. I wanted to know why some citizens accepted things willingly and others couldn't stop questioning the status quo to literally save their lives.
0425252868|4.0|The story is amazing.  The authors have done a fine job setting the facts up in linear, easily comprehended story line.  My thanks for all the time and effort to research and bring this story to light.  That said, the writing is clunky in places.  No one will accuse it of being great literature.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|not one of his best movies. it had an ok plot and decent action. would have waited for it on Netflix
B00000DBXL|5.0|Great album smattered with gems like Satan is my motor, Guitar, and Sheep go to Heaven make this not just a follow up to Fashion Nugget as the title suggests. Unabashed tour de force is a more appropriate description and one that McCrea no doubt would enjoy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much you can craft like make your own house and live out in the woods and you can play with friends so I think y'all need to get this app its worth 6.99 so get it and tell me what you think about it
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|It was just \\"okay.\\" I probably would have enjoyed it more at a younger age. I found the story juvenile, the characters irrational and several veins of the story implausible--mobsters and such. Would only recommend to readers in their 20's.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|I had a problem with my kindle charging and this was their solution. It did not work I still have to prop up the to rest on the cord in order for it to charge at all. Yet it still only charges half of the time.
B00C061I3K|4.0|You know what happens when you don't evolve or at the very least try something new you get a \\"Human After All\\" record. Everyone wanted another homework or discovery for the third album and they tried. And for the most part it was met with a negative response. With RAM Daft Punk decided to scrap everything and write a love letter to the music that's inspired them for so long. They also pulled out all the stops by bringing in musicians they wanted to work with. Highly talented musicians with technical chops to match their production value, which is nothing short of spectacular.<br /><br />RAM is a journey. Listen to it once, be put off by it, maybe even hate it. Come back and give it another listen realizing this is not the old Daft Punk. It grows and it has some serious depth and replay value. I'm not crazy about the entire album. Touch is still a bit \\"too much\\" for me and Doin it Right doesn't really go anywhere IMO. But I respect the fact that this is pretty fresh and a completely new angle for Daft Punk. Yes it's (disco/70's) been done before, but not exactly like this. It's a warm album that's best listened to cruising with the windows down on a warm summer night.<br /><br />This album could've been an absolute train wreck. Kudos to Daft Punk for pulling it off.
B004G7UTXG|3.0|This was a really good movie and very interesting, Robert De Niro played a good role and I don't always like his movies.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Get story about a mostly forgotten period in our history. The acting was above par. It is well worth your time to remember a sad time for our country.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|My daughter has recently discovered Legos and cannot get enough of them!  This was a perfect addition to her collection.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it is wonderfully developed.  big buttons with great graphic Colors.  better than a regular calculator.  the history memory is a fantastic odes.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I think Khaled Hosseini is an amazing storyteller, but I didn't love this book.  I liked the book, but didn't love it.  It was a beautiful story that was both sad and heartwarming, but I felt it barely scratched the surface of all the characters in the book.  And the Mountains Echoed could have been an amazing multi-generational family story much like the Thornbirds, but it would have required another 400-500 pages.  I really felt like I was reading the CliffsNotes version of what could have been a brilliant novel.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I am truly loving playing this game! Being able to go visit others reefs and see what they've done is a great plus too!!! Thanx for having this game! Keeps me out of trouble in Vegas.  Signed, Grandma in Lost Wages.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I like this show a lot and the 8th season is great. Amazon instant video works really well. I highly recommend it.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Looks really good and plays great on my kindle,there is some gaming issues I'd like to see different but it's an awesome play
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|This was a good movie. Not one of Denzel Washington's best performances. I thought the best part was the opening scene.
B003568FR6|5.0|I have tried a couple of different exercise videos by different teachers, but Jillian Michaels is my top choice.<br />She makes each workout challenging yet not so difficult that you give up. Each interval is short enough so that you don't get bored with the circuits. I also love that almost all moves are easily modifiable and you can add or remove hand-weights.<br /><br />I wish each workout was a bit longer than 20 minutes, maybe 30 minutes would be perfect. Sometimes I even do two videos in one workout, but usually I'm exhausted after completing just one. Level 1 and 2 are both very challenging and are enough to replace a gym session. Personally I think Level 3 is too much for me, but I guess you could modify all the moves to fit your level of fitness.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was written well before the movie came out and I must say, it is a fantastic read. Of course, it gives much more detail and insight into the characters lives than the movie. I would highly recommend the book, as it does a wonderful job of tugging at your heart strings. I personally love when books make me think about my own life and leave me wanting to better myself. Highly recommended.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Best book by Sanderson yet. Won't regret this read! Keeps you enthralled from the get go ans never lets go.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Excellent read great action plenty of suspense with very little back tracking in personal history never seen the end coming
0345479092|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Secrets of the Baby Whisperer. A good lite read but with pertinent facts and content. I would definitely recommend this book for  new parents, grandparents, nannys and doulas
B00785P2QC|5.0|A really good game. Lots of different options to chose and building my virtual city was really good fun. Only problem is that invest points are hard to earn
B009LMTDL0|5.0|As a husband to my wife, brother to my sister, and son to my mum, I'm incredibly grateful to Ms. Sandberg for her honesty and stories. This book provides useful information for both genders and causes great pause and reflection.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I am so disappointed with this last book in the series. Worst out of them all. Sookie just settled. There really was nothing to the story. There was not character development, nothing new. I kept hoping Sookie would meet someone new, a soulmate. But sadly, the series just ended with a sizzle.
B00CMT52T6|4.0|Genre-wise I would say \\"Mud\\" is best described as a coming of age drama thriller. Matthew McConaughey sporting the most terrifying prosthetic dentures in film history outside of the horror genre, stars as the title character Mud. As good as he is in his role and as good as the other adult actors are, the film ultimately belongs to the young teen actors Tye Sheriden (The Tree of Life) and Jacob Lofland (film debut). I actually would love to see these boys get noticed come Oscar season but that isn't likely to happen.<br /><br />Film Breakdown<br />After a flood in a small Arkansas town, two teenage boys discover a boat lodged in a tree in a wooded area near the river. They quickly discover that someone resides in the boat's cabin area. The boys soon find out that it is Mud living in the boat and that he is hiding out for reasons I won't say in this review. In no time road blocks are set up to try and find Mud, one of the boys lets Mud know of this development and that is when Mud realizes he must flee by river. There is more to all this involving the Reese Witherspoon character whom is staying in a near by motel and supposed to be joining Mud in this escape plan. Amongst all this our two teens learn some valuable lessons about life and love.<br /><br />The film is just over 2 hours and also stars Sam Shepard, Sarah Paulson, Ray McKinnon and Michael Shannon which I thought would've been great as the bad guy here but Shannon is playing a lot of bad guys lately with \\"The Iceman\\", \\"Man of Steel\\" and \\"Premium Rush\\" that is was also nice to see him play a regular guy and even provide some of the films comic relief.<br /><br />Overall highly recommended to all audiences! The film has mild language and gun violence, no sex or nudity. I would approve the film for 10 years and up.
B0091WD4ZQ|5.0|Seldom in cinema does one find such extensive and thought provoking dialogue from a young woman more well offered than the young man.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|dictate function needs work. sharing notes too difficult. love the browser integration. an integral handwriting capability would be useful. skitch is a pain.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|The story is all over the place. Characters are unpleasant. Jennifer Lawrence is merely adequate -- surely one of the most ridiculous awards in Oscar history. Only Robert DiNero stands out. Why, oh, why did this get so much attention over other far better films? I guess we'll never know!
0425252868|5.0|I have bought both of the books from this author, Adam Makos is brilliant! Very well written. I have read this book & his second one, Voiced of the Pacific twice and find something new each time!
B008476HBM|5.0|Just love it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Convenient and almost surprised this doesn't automaticaly come with most devices.  Can't imagine spending money for social media and glad we have these apps

0062059963|3.0|You can imagine my apprehension of initially posting a review, based on the previous actions of the author and her party, but I hope that had been a lesson and that it's all behind them.<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />\\"`Sometimes I feel like Maxon and I are in our own version of the Selection. It's just him and me, and one of us will get you in the end; and I can't decided who's worse off.\\" (210)<br /><br />Only six girls remain in the competition to win Prince Maxon's heart and the crown. America has a choice of her own too. With Aspen within reach and living in the palace with her and Prince Maxon, will America choose the right guy?<br /><br />(I'm trying to be spoiler free, and honestly if you haven't read The Selection, you need not read this review.)<br /><br />I have to begin by saying, I loved The Selection. In my figuring, I was elated, excited and enthused to read The Elite because of this reason. I feel that my expectations were somehow let down. Now, I thought maybe my reaction to this book would've calmed down a bit if I let it swim around in my head for a few days, but it didn't, so I'm just going to be truthful and go through the notes I took. The long of the short of it: Love Triangle. Of course I knew there would be one, but I didn't expect it to take over the entire plot and tone of the book. It felt really overwhelming, and the overall affect of the book caused me to hate America more than I have ever hated any main character in a book. She got on my nerves, and truly Prince Maxon doesn't deserve her... maybe even Aspen as well. I felt every action she took towards everything was careless, stupid (for lack of a better word) and took away the love I had for her character in the first book. OH YES ASPEN! I know this tragic event just happened with one of the girls here, but BY ALL MEANS let's up the ante and go on a date behind Maxon's back. (I'm trying to be spoiler free, and honestly if you haven't read The Selection, you need not read this review.)<br /><br />\\"Time. I was asking for a lot of it these days. I hoped that if I had enough, everything would somehow fall into place.\\" (8)<br /><br />I began planting my own scenarios in my head just to make the book better, and to put America through some real trials. I found myself wanting Aspen to get seriously injured or killed, and wishing America would get captured by the rebels. I know it's cruel, but maybe (although probably not with the way things are going,) it would put some sense in her and her horrible judgement in everything. Prince Maxon, just send her home! Even more so, this book brings up a character quality equaling \\"pathetic\\" with the way America keeps going back and forth between loving and spending time with Maxon to hating and deceiving him. Her jealousy is also cringe-worthy because she has absolutely no right to be jealous, with what she's doing. She's so selfish.<br /><br />\\"I wanted to be his dear, his darling. I wanted to be Maxon's alone.\\" (39)<br /><br />In the end, after I've finished and digested everything I've read, I really thought about what went on. When it boils down to it... nothing really happens! I mean, things happen, but the plot doesn't really progress from The Selection. If anything, we are just reinforced with what we could've figured out from the first book; the king's a tyrant and America has two guys under her thumb. That's it, and I suppose that may really be a reason that this book didn't achieve the greatness I wanted it to. I really liked The Selection, and I wanted The Elite to continue my admiration, but it fell flat. I'll read The One, not for America, not for Aspen, but for Prince Maxon and the nation of Ill&eacute;a.<br /><br />------------------<br /><br />First Line: \\"The Angeles air was quiet, and for a while I lay still, listening to the sound of Maxon's breathing.\\" (1)<br /><br />Last Line: \\"If I had them, there was no way I could lose.\\" (323)<br /><br />------------------<br /><br />\\"Time.

B00COGXX7A|4.0|Loved the book so was hoping the movie would be as good as the book.  It didn't disappoint as it was as accurate to the book as could be.  Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel were wonderful as the lead characters.  Definitely recommend to all the romantics out there.  A testament that you can go through horrendous times, but there is hope for a better future if you have the courage to step out and fight for it.
0865478007|5.0|I thought this book so important that I bought six additional hard cover copies and gave them to my Doctor's (I hope they read it.) Also gave a copy to my granddaughter who is getting a PhD in bioengineering. Being able to change the rotten corporate system seems impossible.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I loved Julianne Hough and how accurate the movie was to the book.  Nicholas Sparks has great story lines and would recommend any of his books/movies.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Wonderful movie. Recommend it heartily.  To bad Hollywood has such a monopoly on what he movie theaters run. This should have been easy to go see, Instead we had to find an &#34;independent&#34; movie theater so see it. bought a copy on DVD for future use and to loan out.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|Movie made no sense...couldn't understand a word they were saying.  Could not even sit through the entire movie...really bad.  Expected more from a Tom Hanks movie.  Can't believe he even let this movie go out.  Must be all about the money.
0452295548|5.0|Saw her on TED talks, which I recommend highly. The book was wonderful. We bought several extras copies and gave them to friends.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Never really thought about what they did with all the children that this country received at this time when there parents either passed or got seperated wonderful read
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is an awesome app that I get on every single spare time I get. I love how there's always this excitement to get out of the monsters way and collecting the coin.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I personally purchased Kiss of Steel.<br /><br />Kiss of Steel is the first book in Bec McMaster's London Steampunk series.  Kiss of Steel is a beautiful and addictive story.  With characters that you are drawn to and a story line that won't let you go, it is an all around addictive read.  Steamy chemistry adds to the depth of this story and Bec McMaster pulled the layers together in an artistic way.  Honoria was a force by herself.  You meet this character amid a terrible struggle of poverty after a situation forces her to provide for younger siblings.  In a world where status is everything and you pay in blood for protection, will she be able to shed herself from preconceived beliefs?  Great character chemistry between Blade, the scariest man in the Whitechaple district, and Honoria keep you feverishly turning pages.  I cannot wait to see what will happen next! Kiss of Steel is high romance and is not on the sci-fi end of Steampunk.  This would be a great read for any Historical Romance or Paranormal Romance fan as well!
B005CRQ3IE|1.0|I did not read this book on my kindle, I read it as a regular book that I borrowed. Today I wanted to buy it, but you can only buy anything involving Harry Potter to have on your kindle on this stupid website and you have to pay to have an account ont and that is dumb. I mean, why can't we just be able to buy it on our devices?!?!?!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game, only complaint i have is that if i have started or almost completed a game which ive won or not, it sometimes freezes and therefore i will lose any chests, winnings etc.....quite frustrating but not enough to stop me playing. Def the best bingo app so far :)
0529064847|5.0|I always want to have a bible with me.  I didn't want to spend a lot and this bible was very reasonable.  The printing is outstanding.  As you expect the binding breaks frequently but no more than you would expect for the price.

B000E9910W|5.0|This CD is very good.  I bought it for someone who is from a different generation than I am.  I wanted to get something that had a good represention of all the music and this was perfect.  If I need to get another Doobie CD this would be the one.
B000J4QWMC|1.0|Michael Mann's signature movies are ala Sam Peckinpah action scenes accompanied with heavy soundtracks, powerful script and stylish costume and set decoration, unfortunately his movie version of the tv series he created has none of these qualities. The characters apart from their big names are bland, robotic, empty and dreary. The actions scenes are more like a video game from counter strike. Gone were the stunning visuals of early Mann movies and what we have here is a dark, murky, muddled and bouncing footage of a failed crime movie epic. The script or dialogue needs deciphering, the plot convoluted, the love story trite and most of all a long wearisome movie at near 3 hours of unexciting, monotonous eyesore. After the movie you need to get a load of aspirin for a terrible migraine, corrective spectacles for you eyes and most of a reflection of the reasons why you endured and agonized yourself over this garbage movie. Skip this one and settle for Thief, Manhunter, The Keep, Heat.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is so enjoyable and not to mention original. It is full of surprises and keeps you wanting to read more.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|The first 10 pages i was wondering why this book was such a big hit! but i am glad i persisted through to see the story and the very unique way of narrating the story unfold. Makes you smile, cry, wring your hands in frustration and shake your head in disbelief all in the same page. Unputdownable, already looking for the next Vonnegut book to see if the magic continues
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book. This is a great book and I found it to be a very fast read. I read it in under 4 hours.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I really love this game. It's awesome! Just one thing, a lot of the stuff you need in order to keep building cost the &quot;jewels&quot;. You need to purchase them with real money,or earn them, which is useless trying to do considering that each item you need to buy with them costs around 100 of them. It would help if you could purchase the jewels with the coins. Otherwise, Toatally BOSS game. C:
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this APP, It allows me to keep up with my weather as well as at my parents. Very helpful.

B009I2UH2W|5.0|Works great with my iphone 5... the coil is pretty tight but but the whole thing seems really sturdy to me.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Very funny but also thought provoking! I loved the way Don approached his problems in his logical way and the way he learnt to adapt and change.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I picked this up as a lav for the groom while shooting a wedding. A bit clunky when paired with a recorder, but it did the job fine in a tux pocket.<br /><br />Can't argue with the price, so I'm pretty pleased.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fantastic game!!!!! Awesome graphics, appropriate hints and challenging enough enough without being too frustrating Can't wait until the next room is released!!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's epic! It is my favorite game and game ever and is well worth its price of being FREE! Go get it!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|As usual, Pendergrast delivers.  As a fan of the series, I enjoyed seeing our main man show emotion and hit highs and lows that he typically doesn't demonstrate.  The flow of action follows the usual flow for the series... buildup, clever plot twists, battle scene, unresolved resolution.  What really saves the action is the continual development of characters from P to Corrie to Constance.  Well done.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Draws you in immediately & you do not want to put the book down. Hope we get more books from this new author!
B006C67NP6|5.0|What is not to like....throw away the books, just open this and jam right now. And the price is right.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Tangled, or rather Drew Evans freakin kills me! Emma Chase rocked my world with her manly POV and exact speech, representations, and all that can embody a mans man. I poop (has it been noted to Amazon how much of a pain it is that you can't use swear words in your review?) you not, if you're not hooked from the very first chapter of this book....well, maybe you're just not human. LOL<br /><br />Okay, Drew has the \\"flu\\". His house is a pit, he's been MIA for a week and finally his sister \\"The B*t**\\" shows up to knock him around a few times, or at least that's what she should do. Drew starts to tell his story starting from the beginning, 4 months ago.<br /><br />This story is literally told from a mans POV, well, Emma's not a man, but I swear to God that after Tangled, she could totally be my boyfriend (if I weren't married, I'd ask her out).<br /><br />Drew is an I-banker at one of the most prestigious investment bank firms in NYC, this is also where his father hires on Kate. I can instantly see the connection between Drew and Kate, but there is a problem here. And, it's kinda a big one and all on Kate's side. So, I'm tensed up and waiting for the explosions to start, but............yeah, it's chem class all over again. You know, there's always that one kid in class that wants to see what this chemical will do when mixed with that chemical and BOOM! Drew and Kate are like that, and the best part is that it's told from Drew's POV the entire time, so this crap isn't candy-coated and covered in frickin hearts and flowers with sympathy crap cards all over the side. Drew is in your face, to the point, honest and raw. The telling of this story is poignant!<br /><br />Oh, and because I'm in a pervi-club, I can't go without mention of the sex. This stuff is FIRE!!! another awesome thing about getting a story from a mans POV, we get the sex talk more times in this book and I freakin love it &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3<br /><br />A definite MUST read!!! I laughed hysterically throughout the majority of this book and even found some very relate-able-to-Drew momentsrity of this book and even found some very relate-able-to-Drew moments
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I just finished reading Night Circus for the second time and I' m starting it over right now. It was interesting the first time, a totally different book this time. And now that I've almost got it figured out I want to go back to the beginning to clarify it. What a marvelous book!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I find it enjoyable. Continuous activity. Have to travel back and forth between scenes often though. I enjoy the graphics very much though. Started with free version..but did purchase full version. I have trouble putting it down!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Great series to keep your attention over the summer.  So interesting how the dynamics of gay, widows, etc are dealt with during this time.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I didn't know what to expect but I sincerely enjoyed this quirky novel that was unlike anything I have read.
B0060MYKTY|5.0|I love this show, watched it and I've ordered all the DVDs so I can watch it again later, you never know what's happening next, very entertaining.
B000IDGBWU|4.0|Very energetic movie.  I have watched it several times. It is one you can enjoy time and again. Patrick Swayze was such a great dancer and actor.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I can't wait for each season and episode very entertaining, really enjoy it, I've also bought the DVDs so I can re-watch it at a later time.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great action movie! Nice to see an action movie with &#34;aging&#34; heroes and a great looking heroine!  I love Helen Mirren and hope to grow as fabulously old as her!  The movie was entertaining, and I look forward to the second one, which is out this summer!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is a wonderful sleep app!!!!!! I often have trouble sleeping and this app helps me immensely! I LOVE this app!!!!!!!!!!!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This was a total bargain for this season!  I have a blu-ray player downstairs and dvd player upstairs.  I love that it comes with both Blu-ray, DVD and digital copies so I can watch them anywhere!  I especially love the digital copies (not Ultraviolet) I can even put them on my iPad and have something to watch when travelling!
B002KGEORM|5.0|IT IS VERY ADDICTIVE! Everything about the show is awesome! I am ready for the next season. i keeps you wanting more.
B009MO57H6|2.0|I have the entire series and was actually looking forward to this one coming out because they brought back some kick ass characters from the dead.  I wasn't able to see it in the theater so I was waiting for the DVD to come out.  I AM SO GLAD THAT I WAITED!  I would have been pissed if I paid that kind of money to see it in the theater!  Lots of the normal blood and gore which is great but the rest of the movie just seemed like it was all thrown together without a real script and to keep the audience from noticing it, they just blew a bunch of stuff up.  TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT!
B0094OLFUW|2.0|I loved the xx's first album and was really excited to get this one, and it fell far short of my expectations.  I can appreciate minimalism, but this feels like a rough draft.  There's not enough to each song; it's like a third of the music is missing.  I actually like the songs, but I want the rest of them!  Very unsatisfying.

B00C33M2EE|5.0|I love The Piano Guys. We have been following them on Youtube for about 18 months. Jumped at the chance to attend a live concert they were putting on as part of their tour. Wanted to support their endeavors, so purchased the CD/DVD. We now have their music in the car on the CD, and my kids and I can sit and watch their videos for hours, so the addition of the DVD to this album was a very smart idea. They listened to their fans and I am very supportive of somebody who does that! Thanks!!! There have been other reviews regarding the type of music and so on, so I don't need to cover that.
B004MPR80E|5.0|Easy to read, great narrative of the history of cancer.Well  researched documentation of the development of the efforts to fight cancer.
B003VPS81E|5.0|I was talking to a friend of mine about this concert. He felt that as you move away from Celtic music towards Enya and such, you migrate towards &#34;new age&#34;.  I absolutely loved this video. I would propose that it is not new age but it has a celtic base that dips and crosses into some interesting old Spanish sounds, transporting you to anotherbtime and place. This is what is so appealing to me about the Mummer's Dance.

B008NCSZQ8|5.0|A recent action movie with SO many Marvel heroes, what more could you want? As someone who is just starting to get into the Iron Man movies, this was a part of my Marvel journey as I continue to learn more about the heroes. Loved the movie and the fact that we can stream it right from Amazon! One thing I mentioned to Amazon was figuring out the sound so it's louder through the computer (I have a newer MacBook Pro so it's not like my speakers are overused or older),  other than that I'd say great investment and I am becoming obsessed with the Marvel avengers!! =]
0783231032|5.0|Do yourself a favour and make time to watch 1941 collector's edition DVD. I think it was way ahead of it's time and the movie had to bide it's time and wait for our sense of humour to catch up with it.Slim Pickins one liner sitting on the toilet is worth the price of the DVD and also Jap sailors trying to get Slims radio into the submarine.Also great footage in the features bonus section. If you saw the original movie 30 years ago give it another look. You might be surprised.
B00A88FLI0|5.0|My daughter, my grandson and I enjoyed building  it together. He's very proud of it!<br />It wasn't too difficult, especially for a kit that looks so intricate and attractive when it is finished.
B00B69UQEO|2.0|I have enjoyed DM music since I first heard it in 1987. The apex of their work was Songs of Faith and Devotion. Followed by excellent Ultra and a very good Exciter. Violator and Songs are always on my iPod.<br /><br />Delta Machine, I do not even think it is the same band anymore. Lyrics sound like they are written for the purpose of a rhyme only. Music!? Did they finally switch to a Yamaha purchased at Kmart.<br /><br />I am disappointed to say the least.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Isaacson does an incredible deconstructing a personality and putting it up against a set of principals, which was how Jobs defined himself. Excellent story.
B001MEJY8W|1.0|I did buy the uncut version of this film. Wouldn't of guessed it by watching this tame boring pile of poop. If you have only seen crap like saw or hostle then this might be looking into the abyss for you. Me on the other hand have seen it all pretty much. The shot gun part was ok, could of been better, and the girl cutting her own neck was alright. The part where the girl is beaten and feed lol was alot of nothing, just boring. Then when they skin her, its all off camera. Hellraiser 2 is more graphic, this movie has alot of posers and hype behind it. Save your money or check out.<br />Flowers of flesh and blood, trembling doll of flesh, nekromantik, grotesque, human centipede 2, a Serbian film, i could go on and on those are just some common tiles and way better films. I guess this dvd was kinda cheap, maybe i need to watch it again, as soon as the stupid ring ghost girl poped into the film it just wrecked it for me, lame stuff
B009GN6ESO|5.0|I watched this movie with my 6 year old son and we both loved it. Elliot and ET have a special bond that warmed our hearts.

B00AM0C6YG|5.0|Laura Mvula's freshmen set \\"Sing to the Moon\\" arrests your attention with its originality and joyous musicality.  The layered harmonies of the opener \\"Like the Morning Dew\\" are breathtaking, \\"Our love feels like the morning clouds.\\"  \\"Green Garden\\" is a strong track with its handclap percussion and catchy melody that challenges the listener, \\"And I'll fly on the wings of a butterfly high as a tree top and down again, putting my bag down, taking my shoes off, walk on the carpet of green velvet.\\"  It's deliciously original.  The title track is another favorite of mine with the delicate harmonies that soar, \\"Sing to the moon and the stars will shine, Over you heaven will turn the tide.\\"  Other tracks like \\"Father, Father,\\" \\"She\\" and \\"Diamonds\\" also sparkle.  Enjoy!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Written from a true scientist and doctor viewpoint.  It is hard to understand just what his experience in Heaven was.  His experience just did not sound like the Heaven I read about in the Bible.
B004JQN364|5.0|I was so excited when my little dragon man guy came (he can now join my lion man guy and ram man guy in epic battles).  The detail is brilliant and I love that he has a movable jaw.  Great toys, well made.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Worth the download, game was playable until about level 50 for me before my ability to play using only game won funds. After that I was willing to spend five for game credits (it's already given me that in enjoyment in my judgment), but once I hit the limit for advancement, I doubt I will spend more. Solid game, great replay ability - (fantastic splash screen, folks- love the old school intro! ) well worth making space on your device for.
B008IJT0CE|1.0|Was all ready to install this highly rated app but noticed it requires access to phone calls. Why is that needed, what do you do with phone records?
030758836X|4.0|Was a gift. Assuming he liked it, have not heard otherwise. He is very picky when he come to gifts though.
B000Z8KAUM|5.0|I love all the Ocean's movies. I remember liking &#34;13&#34; the least of the three, but after re-watching it, I would say it is just as well done. The plot is complex enough that I notice new things each time I watch it. A great film that doesn't rely on crude humor or slap-stick jokes.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|is nice game, i play all day, is very interesnting, i recommend it, cool game, and have many leves cool
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Followed Phillip Phillips from start to finish on American Idol so naturally eager to purchase his first CD.  Great mix of songs throughout the CD, you will not be disappointed.  Would highly recommed this CD to any music fans whether you know this artist or not.  Can't wait for the next CD by Phillip Phillips.  Great musician to listen to for years to come.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I love the actor's and the story line, they take the blah out of watchinng TV & one of the best cast that TV has had,
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have to say it took me a long time to give in and read this book. Once I finally read through the first few pages I was hooked. Suzanne Collins writes in a way that you can see what is going on, it's like you are right there with katniss in  her thoughts feeling what she is experiencing. Thank you Suzanne for such a great read I can't wait to start catching fire!!
B00CATSONE|4.0|Very well put together. Good writing. I would definitely reccomend this book to anyone intereseted in science, motivation, and success.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Plenty of action and FINALLY a real story.  I just hate it that it took so long to get here.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I've became a major Daft Punk fan over the years and I always loved their style, but this time they are mostly playing groove, which is cool. I don't know if the younger kids will be impressed but I grew up with some of that left over from the 70's as a kid in the early 80's. I like it.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I would rate all of the Angry Bird games entertaining and give them the highest rating.  Fun to play.  No worries while playing.
B00CWVFPGO|3.0|Hey -- it's entertaining.  What else do you expect in one of his movies? Just ignore all the obvious clueless behavior by everyone else.  Gotta like granny blowing away a bad guy though...
B00CDFWJIG|5.0|So glad I bought it and not just rent.  It's a good movie and i hope there is a 2nd because i will definitely buy that as well.
B004QZ9P6K|5.0|The best thing about this book is that the lessons learned are ones we all need to appreciate more than we do..
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I have read several Nicholas Sparks books and seen all of the film adaptations. Although I never read Safe Haven, I loved the movie. There was an interesting twist at the end. Julianne Hough is beautiful too.
0241953235|5.0|This is a really easy read that is very entertaining.  It is a good light book to read on rainy days.
B00AA0RZZI|5.0|I REALLY LIKED IT...I READ IT TWICE ALREADY.  I WAS JUST SORRY IT ENDED...I WANTED TO READ MORE!  HOPEFULLY E.L.JAMES WILL WRITE ONE MORE!
B004ELSDZK|3.0|This is a beautiful game, well rounded, responsive, and really smart, but gets boring rather quickly, as levels are pretty much repetitions in groups of 20s.<br />I recommend it if you are looking for a &#34;dentist's waiting room&#34; kind of game, but not really the &#34;play for 1h on the sofa&#34; one.
0385360177|5.0|AS ANNA SAID THROUGHOUT THE BOOK, 'OH MY'.  IT WAS A VERY STIMULATING BOOK, TO SAY THE LEAST.  I WOULD LOVE TO MEET A GENTLEMAN HANDSOME, RICH, AND VERY SEXY!
B003EI2EH2|4.0|A great book for reading, but can not comment on the results, as I have not completed everything suggested.  Everything sounds good and I hope to provide an update when I finish the book.  Otherwise, I like it.
B00846REIS|5.0|I honestly didn't think it got better than 50 shades but the crossfire series is way better! Cannot wait for Entwined with you!
B007VTUYWW|4.0|We had seen it years ago, and we watched it again via Amazon Prime, partly because of recent publicity about Angelina's health issues.  Of course the action is often improbable.  This is entertainment and not some documentary.  A good film deserves a second watching, and that is more than I can say for most movies.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|kind of open end, not really my taste of humor.<br />On other side actors did great job and whole movie is nice
