0385737947|5.0|The pace of the story, the description of the scenes, the people, All are wonderfully done.     I read this in two days, an easy and fast read, but not for a vacation trip. You'd spent too much time   with the book !!     I cant wait for the next one to come out!, wont say its a must read, but it is money well spent and a   very enjoyable time.
B00005JLD4|4.0|This is directed to Karl, I read several of your reviews and I have come to the conclusion that you have a black white problem or is it deeper?. If the events documented in a film are factual then deal with it. It does not mean that every white person is a monster and set out to conquer other races. I wonder how you feel about films dealing with the holocaust. It would be very interesting to have a discussion with you. You need to get out more and surround yourself with people, preferably people of different ethnic backgrounds who do not just subscribe to your point of view. I am still trying to get my head around how you got something racial out of the movie Hitch.
0743201140|5.0|I have ordered probably 80+ copies of this book over the last several years and think it is one of the best motivational and insightful books of its time.
0385504225|1.0|Horrible, at least 300 pages too long.  The words &#34;Suddenly, everything made sense..&#34; or a different version of it were used I would guess 25 times in the book.  I mean its a good way to build suspense but by the fourth time I just felt &#34;seriously, everything makes sense.. AGAIN&#34;  Very bad, I really wish I hadn't wasted the time or money to read.
0061719544|5.0|Easy read. It reminds me that this country is the best thing going and we should make life an adventure-just with a lot less drugs and alcohol. Keep it up Craig!
B002HHGE9K|5.0|Ok, I know there have now been like 6 different editions of this live album, and all of them sound horrible. Not this one! The best yet sound quality and super nifty packaging. Someone must have found the King Biscuit Flower Hour recordings as opposed to the masters used for every other issue of this set. You'll love it! Crank it and enjoy, but watch your woofers! Greg's bass is powerful.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|I very much like this film.  It really tives a fine point of view of the high points and turning points in Ghandi's life.  I show clips of it to my Sophomore class in college and they are always impressed with it.
B001M4YZ90|4.0|Whew!!! Just when I had lost faith in My Ritchie, this came along, and it is very good.<br />(A fitting atonement for the extremely bad Revolver...)<br />Greard Butler and  Thandie Newton give great performances
B00000DHRX|5.0|There are some songs on this 2 disk CD that I had totally forgotten that George had done.  The music and CD is just excellent.  George Michael is such a dynamic singer, and I am glad  that I was able to purchase this CD set.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|I GOT THIS FILM FOR MY WIFE BECAUSE SHE LOVES BARBRA.IT IS A GOOD FILM AND MUST HAVE BEEN HARD FOR HER TO DO
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I was sorry to come to the end of this book, and to leave the characters behind.  We are taken to different time periods and to different continents with the tale of a three women, caught and affected by their time in history.  A fascinating book, and a well written melding of past and present.  Five stars from me.
0316044695|5.0|Great book which wonderfully depicts the strength, fortitude and selfless service these SEALS dedicated to our country. Anyone interested in the special operations community should have this on their must read list - much respect.
0375413405|5.0|Excellent book with lots of great, easy to use recipes.  Bought this book for my wife after seeing the movie, Julie and Julia...looking forward to tasting the results!
B002M9FWQE|4.0|Funky, Brit-pop is back!<br /><br />Mika returns with his new CD, \\"The Boy Who Knew Too Much\\", the much-anticipated follow-up to his successful \\"Life in Cartoon Motion\\" of 2007.  Produced by Mika and Greg Wells, who has worked with Katy Perry and P!nk, this new collection is just as fun, candy-coated and laced with childlike innocence as its predecessor.  However, moreso on this album than on the last, it is easy to discern Mika's sexuality, which he has spoken about with discretion in the past.<br /><br />Below is a brief description and numerical rating of the tracks on this CD. You can also get the Special Edition for an additional $2.00, ($11.99), which includes some extra video footage.<br /><br />Track 1: We Are Golden--(8)--a lively song to start off with--\\"we are not who you think we are, we are golden!\\"  Mika's accent shines through on the chorus to this teenage rebellion song.  Don't go by our famiies, don't go by the tragedies we've been through, we're young and we're alive!<br /><br />Track 2: Blame it On the Girls--(6)--a song about someone who's down on life and has a generally crappy attitude but really has no reason to, since he has great looks and everything everyone else envies.  He'll blame his misery on everyone else, so long as he doesn't have to take the blame himself.<br /><br />Track 3: Rain--(8)--never has singing about being miserable been so catchy and sing-along encouraging.  You'll be happy to sing about how much you hate when it rains.<br /><br />Track 4: Dr. John--(7)--Beatles-esque rocker about trying to live life but feeling like you've failed your parents in the long run, so now you're enlisting the help of Dr. John to help you make sense of it all.<br /><br />Track 5: I See You--(8)--a powerful piano ballad about being in love with someone but it being complicated in the sense that you can't let them know.  If they fell for you too, though, how would you know?  Neither of you can express it.  So he'll just adore them from afar, no matter how painful that is.  It is easy to imagine this song as a Broadway number.<br /><br />Track 6: Blue Eyes--(9)--this fetching number has an almost reggae edge to it.  Here, he is trying to cheer up a poor girl whose heart got broken so she's taking pills and wondering why she's not feeling any better.  \\"What's the matter, matter, blue eyes, blue eyes?\\"  You can almost imagine the girl sitting on the beach with Mika, smiling through her tears and giggling at him.<br /><br />Track 7: Good Gone Girl--(9)--this is one fun song about a girl who used to be a good girl but has abandoned her dreams and now steps on and uses men before they can step on and use her.<br /><br />Track 8: Touches You--(7)--jingly piano rock reminiscent of George Michael's style about wanting to be close to someone in any form that allows you to touch them.<br /><br />Track 9: By the Time--(8)--Mika usually weaves miserable things into poppy and catchy songs to help you forget your worries.  Here, he makes a beautiful ballad about missing a lost loved one.  By the time he fell asleep, they were gone.<br /><br />Track 10: One Foot Boy--(7)--catchy, foot-tapping tune about being done once and for all with a relationship.  He won't stand being asked to change anymore--you love him for who he is or he's done!  And he's done.<br /><br />Track 11: Toy Boy--(10)--a touching, tender song that sounds like it was lifted from a puppet show but contains much deeper content.  The young boy sleeps with his boy doll until his mom has a problem with it and supplements a Barbie doll.  The boy doll though is left hurt by the event and hopes the boy will remember him and his love for him when he is older.<br /><br />Track 12: Pick Up Off the Floor--(8)--a cute song to end the CD with, those boys are going to do what they're going to do so don't let it get you down.  If he doesn't love you anymore, pick your heart up off the floor and move on.<br /><br />Overall album rating: 8song as a Broadway number.    Track 6: Blue Eyes--(9)--this fetching number has an almost reggae edge to it.  Here, he is trying to cheer up a poor girl whose heart got broken so she's taking pills and wondering why she's not feeling any better.  \\"What's the matter, matter, blue eyes, blue eyes?\\"  You can almost imagine the girl sitting on the beach with Mika, smiling through her tears and giggling at him.      Track 7: Good Gone Girl--(9)--this is one fun song about a girl who used to be a good girl but has abandoned her dreams and now steps on and uses men before they can step on and use her.    Track 8: Touches You--(7)--jingly piano rock reminiscent of George Michael's style about wanting to be close to someone in any form that allows you to touch them.    Track 9: By the Time--(8)--Mika usually weaves miserable things into poppy and catchy songs to help you forget your worries.  Here, he makes a beautiful ballad about missing a lost loved one.  By the time he fell asleep, they were gone.    Track 10: One Foot Boy--(7)--catchy, foot-tapping tune about being done once and for all with a relationship.  He won't stand being asked to change anymore--you love him for who he is or he's done!  And he's done.    Track 11: Toy Boy--(10)--a touching, tender song that sounds like it was lifted from a puppet show but contains much deeper content.  The young boy sleeps with his boy doll until his mom has a problem with it and supplements a Barbie doll.  The boy doll though is left hurt by the event and hopes the boy will remember him and his love for him when he is older.    Track 12: Pick Up Off the Floor--(8)--a cute song to end the CD with, those boys are going to do what they're going to do so don't let it get you down.  If he doesn't love you anymore, pick your heart up off the floor and move on.    Overall album rating: 8
B002JC9RMY|5.0|Okay, they did good to keep the story of Dragon Ball going, they even keep Goku silly as he away is and have all the main characters on it. This movie is great but I hope on the next should be better, like make the Z series, that when Dragon Ball start to take off. Well this great movie.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|The definitive World War II documentary, emotionally gripping and edifying on virtually every level: excellent production values, with superb photographs, top-flight film footage and accurate descriptions of the sweeping political movements, gargantuan military engagements and profound human tragedies that defined the conflict - made even more compelling by means of a superb narrative from the legendary Laurence Olivier.
B000002JSN|4.0|I'm giving this double cd 7/10 and I'm breaking it down like this: the first cd gets 3/5 and the second cd gets 4/5. Led Zeppelin get classed in the \\"classic rock\\" category as far as bands go, and I can't say that I can see why, based on having recenltyish heard all their albums, up to Presence.  Occasionally, they will come up with an iconic song worthy of the kind of classic rock that gets played on Australian commercial radio, but usually it is surrounded on the album by less commercial songs.  The first cd of Physical Graffiti is ample demonstration of that. \\"Kashmir\\" is the band's crowning glory, in my view,  but the rest of the songs on that cd, whilst often harder than anything they've done until that album, don't really have the quality which makes them unforgettable, like \\"Kashmir\\" and the (usually) one great song of their first three albums (though I don't think their debut had one such song in any case. Led Zeppelin IV is the album where they actually nail what it is to be a Classic Rock band...an immortal album).        The second cd cements my conviction that Led Zeppelin aren't really a rock band...they're sub-rock...folk rock, if you will.  They nailed that genre, in my view, on Led Zeppelin III. That is my second favourite Zep album after IV. So, whilst I'm not convinced that the band has much in the way of classic rock credentials, apart from a few classics (too few, in my view, for a band of such enormous stature), they do do an interesting line in folk rock, which the third cd illustrates well.     Here's my thoughts on the cds:      CD 1:      Their greatest ever song:    Kashmir - an epic song at 8:28 minutes length.  It's the kind of song that whilst long, would not suffer for being doubled in length, like, say, The Velvet Underground's best song \\"Murder mystery\\".  This song has a cool beat and a classic, immortal guitar riff.  Also features violins and brass instruments. When the violins get an Arabesque feel to them, it makes the song even more of a classic than it already is. Has one of the great lyrics in song history too \\"Leaves no trace like thoughts inside a dream\\".  Just a brilliant turn of phrase.  The sound on this song seemed more stereo than hi-fi to me though, which is a niggle.      On second listen some songs which sounded more interesting:      The rover - a hard rock song with grinding guitars. Sort of reminded me of Foreigner's later song \\"Urgent\\". A bassy track with a riff. Good, melodic lead guitar. Spanking drums. Track sounded staticky to me though. Features the lyric \\"The sandmen\\". Which brought to mind Metallica's later song \\"Enter Sandman\\", which is a classic.     In my time of dying - notable for the drumming. A slide guitar is used throughout and the intro has a country flavour to it. The rest is bluesy, with booming bass drums and just generally the drums being thumped.  Actually, the drumming reminded me a bit of later band INXS, although I think INXS made that kind of thing more interesting...and metal band Coldseed seemed to do similar things to INXS on occasion, drumming wise.       The rest:      Trampled under foot - synthesiser has a sort of Stevie Wonder \\"Superstition\\" ambience to them. A boogie/funky track, where lead singer Robert Plant has a cool, raspy and phlegmy quality to his singing.    Custard pie - has harmonica. Has a strange guitar sound to it, though that may in fact be the synthesiser...in any case, it's a signature sound for the band.    Houses of the holy - a bassy track with a guitar and bass riff.        CD 2:      The best song:      Ten years gone -  on second listen I marked this one down as the best on this cd. The guitar has a nice tone to it and the bass guitar is distinct. This track has quite a nice melody going for it.  It's mostly a mellow track but goes a little rock sometimes. Plant, I think, has a raspy voice in this song.      Next best songs:      In the light - has a bagpipe sounding synthesiser, I think. Later you get a harpsichord type sound.  A melodic track and Plant revisits some prevous songs, vocally. 8:46 long.    Bron-yr-aur - a nice, airy track with two accoustic guitars. An instrumental with a folksy ambience to it.    Down by the seaside - amiable, country flavoured electric guitar song.  A gentle song which has the organ.         On second listen, some songs which sounded more interesting:      Night flight - features the organ, and has a chugga-chugga riff to it. Reminds me of \\"I hear you knocking\\". Been a while since I've listened to this album, so I assume that I have the Dave Edmunds' song in mind.    The wanton song - a heavy sounding song with bluesy vocals.    Boogie with Stu - has an interesting drumming sound...synthesiser sounding.  Honky tonk piano sound to it, and the vocal style is 1950s sounding, I think.        The rest:      Black country woman - has interstitial banter, like that found in the album \\"Trout mask replica\\". Drum sounds bassy and a harmonica is featured. Accoustic guitar.    Sick again - a heavy rock track as far as the riffing and drum beat goes.        Recommendations:      If you want to hear Led Zeppelin in Rock Gods mode, you can't go past Led Zeppelin IV.  If you want their more folk rocky sound, Led Zeppelin III is good.  For something which I think can grow on you, and which I rate higher than Physical Graffiti, go for Houses Of The Holy.    Try:    Black Sabbath: Black Sabbath.   To me, this unique Black Sabbath record also has a folk rock kind of ambience going for it. Their greatest album is the follow up, Paranoid. Their next, Master Of Reality, is also pretty good, and if you like that, pretty much all the albums after that, up until Sabotage, are similar and of good quality. In fact, I rate Black Sabbath the more important band out of the two.    Or:    Midnight Oil: Place without a postcard.  Political pop/rock band from Australia. This is also a unique album for them. Not my favourite, but it does have a folk/traditional style to it which fans of Led Zeppelin may appreciate, if they like that in Led Zeppelin.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Love these headsphones.  They work.  They stay on the head.  They are styling.
B000002KFJ|5.0|On first listen I was inclined to give this album 8/10, but on second listen I think it is worth 9/10. That makes it their second best album, after Paranoid, by my calculations. This is a good, hard-rocking album but maybe they should have stuck with the tone of some of their songs instead of changing its nature.  I'll explain later. By the way, my cd isn't the same as the one I'm reviewing...the last two tracks on my cd are \\"Am I going insane (Radio)\\" and \\"The writ\\". The cd which I am putting my review to has an extra song, I think, and two of the last tracks are swapped around, compared to mine, I think.<br /><br />The best songs:<br /><br />Thrill of it all -  the first part of this song is especially good. It's grungy and I really like the texture of the guitar sound. The drums get thumped on this track, but later on they sound spaced out.  The last part of the song is is synth pop/rock. This is what I mean by them changing the tone of the song. Really, I would much rather have had the first part of the song extended and stopped right there.<br /><br />The writ - I like the mood at the start of this song. It's mellow and eerie, then turns rock. Ozzy's vocals are good here...shrill.  When the song turns rock, it's initially good, but I'm not as captivated by the later rock part. There is a pretty sounding string instrument part and also the harpsichord, I think. Nice in any case. There is a short, nonsense outro, which may be a bonus track...or just a weird way to end the album.<br /><br />The next best song:<br /><br />Megalomania - the first part of this song is especially interesting. It has a mournful quality to it. Later it turns into a rock song and Ozzy sounds like Davros here (that's a Dr.Who pop culture reference!). The riff sounds familiar in this song, but I can't place it.<br /><br />Best of the rest:<br /><br />Supertzar - this could be THE most surprising Black Sabbath track ever...and that's saying a lot...pretty much every album, from Paranoid, perhaps, to this, feature one quirky, very un-rock track.  Has choral music with strings/string section. There are also some heavy electric guitar riffs on this instrumental.<br /><br />Am I going insane - has a cheesy sounding synthesiser. Ozzy's vocals are cool on this song. It sounds like Axl Rose, of Guns'n'Roses is doing the backing vocals on this song...so, perhaps now we know what Axl was influenced by as a kid?  In trying to decipher what my notes are referring to, I think that they are saying that the transition between this song and \\"The writ\\" is great...a scene from Hell, a nightmare. Not fresh in my memory, this album, so I can't expand on that any further.<br /><br />The rest:<br /><br />[edit in for the next song, 19/06/2014]<br /><br />Symptom of the universe - Not sure why my original review did not include this song...be odd if my CD doesn't have it. Since I can't verify that at the moment, I'll just say what I wanted to say about this song...it sounds very like a song by a proto-metal Australian band called Buffalo. That song was called \\"Shylock\\". You can You Tube both songs and check this for yourself. Did read somewhere that Black Sabbath did tour Australia with Buffalo after the Australian band had created \\"Shylock\\" and before Black Sabbath recorded \\"Sabotage\\" and this song on it. If you like either song, then you should like the song you haven't heard...they're close enough, in that way. Today I also heard that something similar/identical happened with Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\"...but with a song called \\"Taurus\\" by Spirit. Both songs are on You Tube too. Must check my CD of \\"Sabotage\\" to see if this song is missing. Suck if it does!<br /><br />Hole in the sky - has grinding, throbbing guitars. Not the best song, lyrically speaking (there's one line about \\"no future in cars\\"). Bassy track.<br /><br />Don't start (too late) - a nice sounding instrumental coming in at 0:49 seconds long. The Spanish sounding  accoustic guitar is what makes this track sound so nice.  There seems to be bad separation between the first track and this, the second track. You hear the riff from the first track, \\"Hole in the sky\\", leak into the start of this track. Not sure if that is just a bad division, or whether it is meant to sound that way.<br /><br />Recommendations:<br /><br />If you are serious about exploring Black Sabbath's studio albums, I recommend you check out their first three albums. They are all different.<br /><br />Black Sabbath - to me, this album sounds like folk rock. Not a favourite album of mine, but you will never hear them play this kind of music again.<br /><br />Paranoid - their crowning glory. It's Classic Rock material. Never again do they write such great, memorable and accessible songs.<br /><br />Master Of Reality - this is the prototypical Black Sabbath album, and their best until Sabotage topped it.  Really, if you like Sabotage, I think you will like every album from Master Of Reality up to Sabotage.  Those two just happen to be the best, in my opinion, of that run of consistent albums.  It's this run of albums which defines this band's contribution to a certain style of heavy metal, I think.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over and notice new things about it each time. I haven't bought a movie to keep for myself in years but I just had to have this one.
032147404X|5.0|I am new to photography and finally purchased my first DSLR camera (Canon50D). Now after reading the entire manual, I wondered what I got myself into. It has all these great features, but says nothing about how you should use them to take great pictures. So my next step was too look for a book that would introduce me to digital photography using a SLR camera. Well this book delivered. Scott makes the book easy to read and even makes it easier to pick up the camera and start shooting. Though his humor and intellect, I've managed to stop using all the auto settings and to started to shoot in the other modes that the camera has. He provides instructions on how to use certain features on a Nikon or a Canon which makes it relative to the camera you are using. He even gives suggestions on equipment and work arounds if you don't have the \\"professional\\" equipment. Each chapter is on a separate type of photography, and gives you the practical answers that anyone can understand. I loved this book so much, that I ended up buying the next 2 books in the series.   So if you are just starting out, or want to take you skills to the next level, then this is a great book.
B001ECE6C6|5.0|I've never been a real fan of recasting Metheny originals with lyrics, but this unheralded release scored big with me. Jopek (and the band) seamlessly weaves her originals between Metheny covers and Pat does was Pat does best -- blow powerful synth gtr lines! Be sure to get the original POLISH language version -- you may not understand the words, but you'll appreciate what she's communicating.
1569242739|5.0|Oh My Goodness!  These cupcakes are amazing.  We were recently instructed by my 2 year old son's doctor to restrict his dairy intake.  I was SO worried about what to do for his upcoming birthday.  Not anymore.  We checked out the book from the library and made the basic Golden Vanilla cupcakes with Chocolate Buttercream frosting as our test batch.  The only words out of his mouth for the past three days have been \\"Mommy, I want another cupcake\\". (To be honest, that is the same thing I was thinking.)    I gave some to neighbors and friends who also loved them.    Some of the responses were \\"Wow! You know how to cook hippie food!\\"    \\"These are really good, how did you get the cake so moist?\\"   \\"This chocolate frosting is great\\"    I placed my order today so I can have this cookbook within arms reach.    Now if I can only find some recipes for dairy free ice cream that are this good.....
0812548094|5.0|This book is very long, but very good. I really enjoyed the first book, but I think I like this second one better.
044024367X|1.0|having had knee replacement surgery at the end of June...I was looking for something to get into during the months of recuperation....I found it with Jack .......great series.....loved the character and the writing style....bought all 13 of the novels....first 11 were great...could not put down...#12.....? well, perhaps Lee had a bad day or a bad week or something..maybe a pressure deadline...who knows? This one just missed everything.....could not wait to be finished....happy to say that #13 was back up to speed and very enjoyable.....everyone has a off day and an off effort.....so don't give up just because he stumbled on this one.....one out of thirteen isn't bad.....
0385504225|4.0|I finished the book literally about 20 minutes ago and felt I had to say something about it.  At first, I was rolling my eyes and thinking Oh God (no pun intended!!) this is just The Da Vinci Code repackaged!  Then I got to the climax of the book and said aloud \\"NO DUH!!!\\"  Then I got to the end and I was so pleasantly surprised. The end actually changed my attitude towards what I thought was going to be a silly book.  Unlike the reviewer who said it was It was an anticlimactic ending, I felt it was thought provoking and possible.  I say give the story line a chance because I believe the main thing in this story is the symbolism and not the crime.
0765356139|1.0|This is a typical filler book.  Sincerely not worth the time it took to read it.  I skimmed over whole chapters of repetitive descriptions of 'feelings' and 'angst'.  I kept thinking that it would speed up somewhere, but just ended up disappointed.    Do yourself a favor and go to the bookstore, find a chair and read the last few chapters then buy the third book to take home.
0847830942|5.0|A wonderful collection of hand built bicycles. Oversize book is not too big but large enough to convey the detail, beauty and engineering of these works of art.
0743437497|3.0|Not a bad book, but not as good as Carrie, in my opinion.  The first four parts of the book were great, but the last part got a little too silly for my tastes.  It seemed to me that the story was going in the direction of a man who was simply going insane and that would have been a good way to conclude it without bringing in supernatural aspects of the hotel.  It would have been interesting to see how everything was explained through Jack's insanity.  But that's not how it was done.  The story was well told, regardless, and King's attention to detail in his writing gets better with each book I read.
B002JYPV3G|5.0|It's been ten years of complete madness, and Slipknot never seems to dissapoint. When Slipknot decided to re-release their first (and possibly greatest) album, it was like 1999 again. I preordered a copy in less than a minute, waiting for it to arrive. Once again, Slipknot didn't dissapoint.    For all you guys who bought the first album, don't worry; the CD is not just the original with some \\"Thank you\\" letter by the band. The CD contains 15 original tracks from the first album (including Purity), the re-released track \\"Me Inside\\" when Purity was removed, Get This, both \\"Spit it Out\\" remixes (\\"Stamp You Out\\" and \\"Hyper\\"), (sic) mole injected remix, Wait and Bleed Terry Date mix, and four demos (Wait and Bleed, Snap, Interloper, and Despise). The original album recieves 5 stars on its own, the best songs being Spit it Out, Wait and Bleed, Surfacing, (sic), and Eeyore. The remixes are interesting, seeing what someone else could do with the song, and the demos are awesome while you can see how they sounded like in their younger years. The only problem with the CD is that Frail Limb Nursery is not on the album. This track was removed along with Purity, but while Purity got re-released, Frail Limb Nursery some how never appeared. I don't know why, I thought the 10 year anniversary would include every single song, but the song is only less than a minute, so it's very easy to forget about. All in all, 10/10.    The CD also includes a DVD, which is actually two movies in one, plus four music videos. Of the (Sic) is the first movie, which is a documentary of the band with a commentary by Shawn \\"Clown\\" Crahan. The film is very interesting and shows how the band was like back in 1999-2000. I'd give it a 8/10. (Warning: The opening is a one minute scene of a bandmate throwing up. If you have an uneasy stomach, skip through this part). The second movie is a whole entire live show of the band in Dynamo 2000. The show plays 7426, (sic), Eyeless, Wait and Bleed, No Life, Liberate,Purity, Prosthetics, Spit it Out, Get This, and Surfacing. The concert is pretty good (it's no Disasterpieces though), and the band seems to know what they're doing, the crowd seems extremely pumped, and it's definetly a good movie for all of the Maggots out there. I think it disserves a 9/10. Lastly, there are all four music videos: Spit it Out, the original and claymation version of Wait and Bleed, and the ultra rare music video for Surfacing. Spit it Out consists of the band playing the song, while it also contains shots of the band parodying \\"The Shining\\". Wait and Bleed's orginal video consists of live footage of the band playing the song, but with a music dub of the Terry Date mix. The claymation Wait and Bleed shows a man creating clay Slipknot figures, but they come to life and attack the man. Surfacing is a live show of the band playing, being similar to Wait and Bleed (it's probably the same show), but instead it actually plays the live song, showing you how it sounds live. The music videos are great and deserve a 10/10. The DVD is an average of 9/10.    To conclude, Slipknot 10 Year Anniversary is a great album and a must have for any Slipknot fan. If yoou just got interested in the band, this is the right CD for you. 10/10

B002B4OVWG|2.0|Some friends had suggested I get a Wubbanub since, especially on car rides, my baby would spit out his pacifier and start crying.  No way to reach to the backseat and put it back in.    Unfortunately, the Wubbanub comes with a Soothie brand pacifier attached, and my baby simply does not take a Soothie.  So he makes a face and spits it out every time, and we're back to square one.  Now that he's 14 weeks and can grab things more easily, he seems to like to play with the Wubbanub, but in that case I could just have gotten a stuffed animal at the dollar store!  Cute idea, but unless there's a way to get one with an Avent pacifier (or Nuk or Mam or whatever else other babies like), this hasn't been the miracle it was for other parents.
B0025VLEM0|4.0|I loved (and still) this movie about a romantic comedy with zombies. I bought this on bluray for the quality of the transfer and audio, and I got a little disapointment. I think you can get the same results on dvd. Some extra features are included. Anyways if you liked this movie so much as I did, you defenetly want this on bluray.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|This story has great potential, and is enjoyable if one can ignore most of the woo promotion going on throughout the book. The only salvation for this book is turning it into a movie, in which case most of the nonsense can be skipped in favor of telling the story underneath.<br /><br />Dan Brown likes to put a statement of what is \\"fact\\" in the front of his books, and most intelligent people have the ability to separate the fact from fiction, if research is carefully done. He was more careful in this one than in \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" but there was one point on which his \\"fact\\" statement failed: science. ALL of the science mentioned in the book is not true science. Specifically, the Noetic science, is not science at all.<br /><br />He apparently did not research adequately, or is just especially prone to woo. Probably a third of this book appears to be a propaganda piece for things on the level of \\"The Secret.\\" Please. NOTHING has been proven about the mind causing matter to physically materialize or change -- the closest thing we have come to that is the placebo effect. Thinking \\"good\\" thoughts won't cause nice orderly crystals in freezing water any more than \\"bad\\" thoughts will cause chaotic crystals.<br /><br />I thought Brown was setting these notions up to later shoot them down with a skeptical Langdon. Unfortunately, that is not the case, and it will take stellar reviews on the next book Brown comes out with to get me to even consider purchasing it. Pre-purchase is from now on out of the question.
0439023491|5.0|\\"I relive versions of what happened in the arena. My worthless attempt to save Rue.  Peeta bleeding to death. Glimmer's blotted body disintegrating in my hands. Cato's horrific end with the muttations. These are the most frequent visitors.\\"<br /><br />Nightmares haunt her. Katniss Everdeen has survived the last horrible games sponsored by the Capitol. Beaten, starved, bloody and practically dead, she has been physically put back together --- even the ear that was torn off has been rebuilt. Still she can never be the same because she has killed, she has seen death up close, she has lost friends, and she has risked everything only to be set up once again for another game. This is practically unheard of; once a victor, you are not put back in, but she is a special case. Katniss knows that President Snow, and all he represents, hates her. They hate her for her rebellious nature. They are not satisfied that she is playing \\"their\\" game to perfection, and they will beat her this time. Though she is only 17, she is not likely to live through another ordeal in the arena.<br /><br />In this remarkable second installment of Suzanne Collins's Hunger Games Trilogy, the reader is again swept into the iron grip of the Capitol, a world where no one dares rebel. Nobody disobeys, districts are created, walls are built, rules are brutally enforced and bodies pile up as their smothering laws are put in effect. Her own love, Gale, is beaten within an inch of his life because their relationship cannot be. Peeta, wise and caring, has been set up as her \\"love match,\\" which she must pretend to follow. There is a point, however, when Katniss knows that she does love Peeta and that she does love Gale --- and sadly, they now all suffer for it. She also knows there are no winners, and that this time she will live only to protect Peeta because she does not want what they want for her. The beautiful mockingjay pen given her for her victory in the last games represents her strong spirit; it is a mixture of both the dangerous jaybird and the free-spirited mockingbird.<br /><br />\\"A mockingjay is a creation the Capitol never intended to exist. They hadn't counted on the highly controlled jabberjay having the brains to adapt to the world, to pass on its genetic code, to thrive in a new form. They had not anticipated its will to live.\\"<br /><br />This time Collins has concentrated a greater amount of time building up to the frightening, bloody battles in the arena. Several characters are also more fleshed out (Haymitch, Gale, Peeta, her mother). Katniss has become a narrator with deeper insights and even greater pain. The Capitol does not just torture in a physical way; their mind games are gut-wrenching, soul-killing ploys. In CATCHING FIRE, Katniss faces the betrayal of someone she has learned to trust with her life. The ultimate destruction is one even the reader cannot imagine.<br /><br />Do not even think about starting this book until you have read THE HUNGER GAMES. This is a masterful journey of terror, love and loss. Bravo, Ms. Collins! You have written an absolutely brilliant sequel, and I cannot wait for the conclusion of your phenomenal series.<br /><br />  --- Reviewed by Sally Tibbettsixture of both the dangerous jaybird and the free-spirited mockingbird.<br /><br />\\"A mockingjay is a creation the Capitol never intended to exist.

B002KH4KSY|1.0|I was stoked when there were reports that the original Children of the Corn was being remade by the original film's producers.  Actually, the first time I heard this was about a month ago on the new Anchor Bay Blu-Ray release of the original film.  This is the type of film that should be remade.  The original film had its moments, but was ultimately more goofy then scary, and really strayed way too far from the original King short story.  I mean, come on!  If I knew 'He Who Walks Behind the Rows\\" was an orange dust cloud with an animated skull in it mushrooming up into the air, I probably wouldn't have kept watching.<br /><br />So here we are with yet ANOTHER REMAKE of a film from the 80's.  Sure, the original is no prize so I thought it novel to remake it.  Even better was the producers dusted off King's draft of the screenplay for the 1984 to act as their springboard.  Unfortunately, they rewrote it and made it even worse then the original.  It doesn't even have the benefit of the original's unintentional humor, and hysterically unscary lead baddie performance of Isaac.  The only thing this film retains from King's short story is the fact that our protagonists are the same bickering couple from the short story as opposed to the first film's in sync couple.  Guess what?  The acting is so annoying that instead of getting a couple that legitimately has problems we're just harranged for an hour and a hallf of a wife biting her husband's head off.  A husband who was a Vietman Vet, the remake is set in 1975.  So, guess who's suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome?  You guessed right, and the results are hilarious audio flashbacks at the film's climax, and bullet streaks flying through the air.  The director of this remake obviously wanted to make a statement in regard to violence and its effects in the real world, but I think it's more half baked window dressing then anything of meaning.<br /><br />How can I be sure about the director's intentions?  Well, the DVD comes with a 45 minute making of doc that allows this pompous, talentless hack expause such lofty intentions.  I don't want to sound like a meanine, but this guy seriously spends just as much time putting down the original flick as he does talking up his new version.  It's almost like he doesn't take credit for being involved with the first Children of the Corn at all.  Really lame self promotion.  Oh, and if you're wondering if the great unholy God of this series actually shows up at the end of the film the way King described him in half a paragraph in the original story, you'll be bummed again.  Whether or not his final appearance is as lame as the original's orange mushroom cloud is up to you to decide.<br /><br />The acting is all uniformly terrible.  It's by the numbers.  The only actors who seem to be trying are the possessed kids, but the problem with that is they come off more like petulent brats then malevolent demonic entities.  Sorry, I'm almost convinced that this King story can't be served well on the screen ever.  His main villains are small children.  Child actors just can't pull off the kind of otheworldly malevolence in any believable way.  Sure, they look cute and they're doing nasty things, but one never buys that they are truly evil, but more of a cheap horror effect.  Nothing gets to the more simple minded viewer faster and easier then showing a cute kid with a blank stare doing something awful.  It's cheap scare tactics that don't even work.<br /><br />Bottom line, is this thing was premiered and made in conjunction with the Sci-Fi, oops, I mean Sy-Fy(the further dumbing of America in full evidence), so you know the hit and miss average of quality from past efforts.  I know there are many out there that have been waiting to see King's story finally get the proper treatment.  It's even worse knowing that King himself wrote a screenplay, THAT NO PRODUCER HAS EVEN USED OR EVEN CRIBBED FROM YET!  Why?  Maybe King should buy back the rights to hisscript and try making this thing on his own with Darabont or Garris--his most trusted film collaborators.  But by the time he sees this latest abomination I doubt the tiny shred of care left in him will allow him to give a damn anymore, if he even gives a damn at all.<br /><br />Bummer.ng on his own with Darabont or Garris--his most trusted film collaborators.

B000063DHK|5.0|`Live After Death' is easily the best live album of the mid-Eighties and one of the greatest of an era, period.  It absolutely fits the criteria of any essential concert recording: historical importance (check), a healthy dose of classics and album cuts (double check) and although the live versions may not top their studio originals, the contest is a wash.  Maiden had just finished their mammoth `World Slavery Tour' and in doing so had solidified their position as the most popular heavy metal band on the planet. The band would certainly never headline such venues as Long Beach Area (where much of the double LP was recorded) or Madison Square Garden for up to three and four consecutive nights as their popularity in the US was also at an all-time high which was astonishing as they virtually no radio play unless you counted late night metal shows (much like Metallica until the `90's).  `Death' opens with the stirringly patriotic \\"Churchill's Speech\\" (this always moves me and heck I'm not even British!) which segways perfectly into \\"Aces High\\".  Most of the classics from the band's first five albums are on display though the Long Beach portion, which dominates, is mostly from the Dickinson era (and rightfully so). \\"Revelations\\" (with a curious expletive shouted at the end, Nicko?), \\"The Trooper\\", \\"Number of the Beast\\", \\"Flight of Icarus\\", \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\", \\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\" and even \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" get full workouts. \\"Running Free\\" is the audience participation workout and gets suitably stretched. I saw this show in Providence in May of 1985 so this record is very special to me. Maiden was on top of the metal heap in 1985 and `Life After Death' is a testament to that...this ain't no hair metal!
B002M9FWQE|3.0|Chances are if you liked Mika before, you'll love The Boy Who Knew Too Much. The necessary corollary to that, of course, is if you hated Life in Cartoon Motion, well... let's say there probably won't be too much to like here. Unfortunately, it is this split in opinion that makes The Boy Who Knew Too Much only a middling success as an album. While Mika should be commended for creating yet another record of supercharged, operatic pop music, one practically overflowing with bells, whistles, and that flawless falsetto, it's essentially a more polished version of his debut, resplendent in multi-part Queen-esque harmonies and Scissor Sisters gender-swapping lyrics. From the children's choir backing of outsized opener \\"We Are Golden,\\" to the Elton John piano and tribal drums on \\"Blue Eyes,\\" to the bombastic, overly cheesy production on syrupy ballad \\"I See You,\\" it's the best and worst of everything we've come to expect from Mika over the course of twelve songs.<br /><br />But put aside Mika's utter lack of creative restraint and habit of whamming one in the skull with his lyrically unvarnished messages, and The Boy Who Knew Too Much reveals, from track to track, the heart and soul of a natural-born songsmith. While there's nothing here as immediately grabbing as \\"Grace Kelly,\\" plenty come close. The best of them come in twos: the double punch of \\"Blame It On The Girls\\" and \\"Rain\\" comes first, the former dashing into a syncopated piano/handclap stomp and the kind of memorable chorus that even haters will find impossible to ignore, while the latter alternates between trippy verses and a synthtastic chorus that highlights Mika's spiraling falsetto. \\"Good Gone Girl\\" and \\"Touches You,\\" meanwhile, are two of the most straightforward pop tunes on the record, featuring the requisite amount of piano, glam-rock choruses, and massive hooks that just won't quit. Best of all, they keep the grandiosity to a minimum, instead relying on their effortless melodies and coming out the better for it.<br /><br />It's a shame that Mika still wastes his time on frivolous exercises like the vapid metaphor of \\"Toy Boy\\" and continues to inflate so many good ideas with unnecessary production and hammy performances like \\"We Are Golden,\\" but The Boy Who Knew Too Much is nothing if not a pop album that harbors no illusions about itself. Mika will never be the kind of artist to change his style as tastes evolve, and so it's heartening to hear songs like the haunting electro of \\"By The Time\\" and the lounge-y closer \\"Pick Up Off The Floor,\\" where Mika teases with hints of what he might be capable of. But then the full orchestra comes in on \\"Pick Up Off The Floor,\\" the army of cloned harmonies build up, that falsetto goes where it wants to, and we're left, for better or worse, with the Mika of today.<br /><br />*Originally published in the Daily Trojan newspaper..

B002BSHXJA|5.0|Not going to write yet another long review of this set. Most of my observations have been more eloquently put forward by others here. I refer your attention especially to the James Perlman review. He has nailed it.    Just wanted to add a couple of observations...    The choice of Mono or/and Stereo is a very individual decision. There is absolutely no right or wrong. In the end it boils down to your own individual expectations and listening style. As well as your own ears. No two sets of ears seem to be the same. It also is about how you listen. Some people are very focused on individual instruments and nuances others focus on the sound in its totality. I tend to fall in the first category and - oddly enough - I find mono more to my tastes in most cases.    Something else to keep in mind. There are definitely significant differences between the stereo and mono versions of some songs. In some instances, a particular song may sound quite different version to version due to different takes being used for the mono vs stereo version. In others, the differences are very subtle.    If you are going to be listening PRIMARILY with headphones and/or a iPod-like device you might be a bit disappointed with the Mono - except for PPM and WTB as well as Rubber Soul, Sgt. Pepper and most of Revolver. A solution may be to supplement your Mono with some individual stereo versions of your favorites rather than buy the whole stereo set.     For me personally, most of the Mono offers a superior listening experience. I dislike the false (to my ears) right/left separation and vocals with excess (again to my ears) echo/reverb that permeate quite a few of the stereo versions. But again, that is my taste. It does not make one version any better or worse than another.     What makes the choice even more difficult is there may be some cuts on a single album which sound better in mono while others on the same recording sound better in stereo. For instance, on MMT Strawberry Fields sounds better in stereo while Penny Lane works better in mono.    Bottom line. Both sets are superb and worth every penny. They blow away the 1987 CDs. Do they blow away vinyl? Don't know. Most of mine are somewhat scratched and somewhat degraded from years of use in my youth. If you had pristine vinyl the new releases may or may not be superior.    The ultimate would have been if they had released the remastered mono and stereo on the same disk so you could easily compare A>B and make your own compilation CDs/Mixes of the best of each - again to your own ears and listening situation. In my case, I might have more stereo versions on my iPod (where I listen via earphones/buds) and reverted to the monos when I was at home or playing them on my computer. It's a sin they didn't offer this as an option. But, I'm not going there. Can't change reality.    Regardless of your choice - enjoy it! It's a real treasure for fans both old and new.    [...]

031606792X|5.0|I was thrilled from beginning to end reading Breaking Dawn and grateful to Stephenie Meyer for writing such a wonderful saga. This book was easily the best in the series, although Twilight comes pretty close.     I'm not sure why everyone hates this book so much. I think that it was a wonderful conclusion to the series. One of the best things Stephenie Meyer did well is make Bella relatable. I am nothing like Bella, yet I can relate to her so well in all four books.     This book was well written and if the things that people complain about in this book weren't written, they would undoubtedly complain about them not being there. Stephenie admitted herself that pleasing all of her fans would be impossible, but insisted that this was the story she wanted to write all along.     Most of the complaints that people have are that the story ended happily. But isn't that how a love story is supposed to end, Happily Ever After? Bella's happily ever after is heart warming just like any other fairy tale you might enjoy from childhood.    I can't complain about this book in the least. I will reread it over and over again, as all the other books in the series.
B000068IEU|2.0|I've heard quite a bit about Wes Craven's 1972 debut film \\"Last House on the Left\\" over the years and finally decided to see what the hoopla was all about.<br /><br />PLOT (Spoilers!): \\"Last House\\" is a simple rape/murder/revenge horror flick about two Connecticut girls who go to the big city to catch a rock concert, but they look for pot in the wrong place and end up kidnapped, humiliated, tortured, raped and killed. When the father & mother of one of the victims find out they set out to take revenge; the culprits aren't hard to find 'cause they're, coincidently, overnight guests in their house!<br /><br />This is, apparently, a loose remake of Ingmar Bergman's \\"Virgin Spring\\" (1960), albeit in a modern America setting.<br /><br />WHAT WORKS: Aside from the brief Manhattan scenes, the woodsy Connecticut locations are great (Westport & Redding); the three female actors are cute; and the diversified score (by the actor playing Krug) is entertaining even while a lot of it is incongruous with the material. In addition, the film can be appreciated as an early 70s period piece/oddity or if you're a Craven fan.<br /><br />Also, if you're a gorehound there's some significant gore, in particular a bloody disembowlment sequence.<br /><br />WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Wow, this story is really DUMB. I'm not referring to just the goofy aspects, i.e. the two rural policemen, but to the complete implausibility of the storyline: [SPOILER ALERT!] The criminal gang just so happens to break down right in front of the rural house of one of the victims? Why sure! But there's more, way more: After breaking down on some desolate country road the gang decides to take a frolic in the woods where they torment, rape & murder the girls; their clothes are completely bloody but they're able to fully wash up in a scummy pond and deck themselves to the hilt. Where'd they get the soap and towels, etc.? (I didn't see any) Where'd they get the nice dress clothes? Didn't they just escape from prison? Then they knock on the door of the closest house, the house of one of the victims (which they don't realize yet), and her parents cluelessly allow this suspicious foursome to stay overnight, a couple of 'em in their daughters very room -- unbelievable! Keep in mind that their daughter has been missing since the night before and they should be seriously concerned about that, but they're okay enough to allow four weirdo adult strangers to occupy their home -- Why sure! The revenge of the parents is just as ridiculous. [END SPOILER]. As noted above, many of these scenes are combined with an unfitting goofy score, which makes them all the more absurd. Really, the story is so ridiculous it's as if a 13 year-old came up with the plot but, no, it was written/directed by  Wes Craven, a full-fledged adult with degrees in writing & psychology -- unbelievable.<br /><br />With this understanding, how can the viewer possibly take the story serious? Which is why I find it strange that some people call this \\"the most disturbing film ever made,\\" etc. If the material is absurd it can't truly be disturbing because it can't be taken seriously. Is the violence in the Road Runner disturbing? No. Why? Because it's a cartoon and it's preposterous. \\"Last House\\" may not be a cartoon but it's the same principle because it's just as preposterous.<br /><br />The reason 1978's \\"I Spit On Your Grave\\" works, for what it is, is because it's presented to the viewer in a serious, realistic manner (well, except for parts of the revenge scenes in the last 20 minutes -- but even those sequences are believable compared to the inanities of \\"Last House\\"). Consequently, \\"I Spit On Your Grave\\" is disturbing, \\"Last House\\" is not.<br /><br />One may defend the film on the grounds that it was the first of its kind as far as gore goes. I don't think so. \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" came out four years earlier and has more gore, albeit in black & white. \\"Night\\" is a thousand times more disturbing and horrifying because,again, it takes the material serious.<br /><br />Some may object to how sick & sadistic the criminal scumbags are, but they're supposed to be appalling because this is a rape/murder/revenge horror flick. It comes with the territory.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: I generously give \\"Last House\\" 2/5 Stars for the positive elements noted above but, really, this is one of the dumbest flicks I've ever seen. I find it hard to believe it ever got a green light. You gotta see it to believe it, meaning it's definitely worthwhile as an early 70s curiosity.<br /><br />The film runs 84 minutes and the original cut 91 minutes.w sick & sadistic the criminal scumbags are, but they're supposed to be appalling because this is a rape/murder/revenge horror flick.

B0021L8USK|5.0|i saw this movie with my girlfriend last night and we both loved it. not only does DISTRCT 9 tell a great story of survival after exposure to an alien substance but the movie also reminds people that if we put aside our differences we can work together to solve any problem. the story starts out with a disabled alien spacecraft hovering over Johannasburg South Africa with the crew living in a shanty town known as DISTRICT 9. all is well at first until the government decides that they want the alien technology for weapons. the only problem is the alien weapons are incorporated with bio signature technology meaning that only the aliens could use the weapons. that is all i can say without blowing the plot. now for the historical aspects mentioned in the title of my review. the aliens in the movie are subject to extremely harsh laws like the American Colonists, southern slaves, etc. the area code named DISTRICT 9 evokes being taught in history class about how in Europe during World War II the nazi regime rounded up a certain religious group and exterminated them for no reason. this movie has also drawn alot of controversy over some of the subject matter. because of the extremely graphic violence and language i feel that DISTRICT 9 deserved an R rating but could also be rated NC-17 as the themes of forced relocation, extermination due to race and racism are abundant in the movie. this film is definitly not for kids.

1427207267|5.0|I wanted a smaller size version of this book...EVERY child should have Brown Bear.  This also has a cd/dvd which I did not notice when purchasing but it adds to the value!
0812971825|4.0|I have read two other books by Elizabeth Strout: Amy and Isabelle and her award-winning best seller Olive Kitteridge.   They were all exceptionally well-written books.   All 3 had \\"mini-stories\\" going on around the main plot (in the case of Abide with Me, the plot is about a minister and his family).  After reading Olive Kitteridge, I sought out the other books by Ms. Strout.  I read Olive Kitteridge without knowing it was a best seller. Halfway through, I looked up Elizabeth Strout on the web, because I was sure it was Pulitzer-winning quality.     Some of Strout's characters are likeable, some are horrible.  But they all blend together to create exceptional stories.
1594488916|5.0|I found myself doubtful at reading a non-fiction book. To tell the truth, I think they are too slow, and when I read I want to escape real life. I thought this was just going to be a book about someone who just collects their favorite books. When I first started reading it though, I found similarities in this man and my obsession with books. I thought to myself, OMG! That could so be me! I love the part where he describes how people love to show off their bookcases and calls them my library! I am constantly showing off my new books and I am always telling my husband that we need a library room. I would be in heaven! Frankly, it scares me now. Am I destined to be a book thief? No. Do I collect books? Yes. I am obsessed with collecting books. If I find a great author, I instantly want to own every book this author has published. I even have a shelf of books, which my family knows it as 'Touch-this-shelf-and I-chop-off-your-hands!' shelf, that includes my ARCs and signed copies. Would I ever steal them from someone? No. So, I am overjoyed to know that I am not that bad. This book opened my eyes to the many amazing books that we hold so dear and rare. To think people actually pay up in the hundreds of thousands for some books. I can see where someone would want to own them, but I don't think I could go so far as to steal them as this man has. This is a true story of a Thief, a Detective, and a World of Literary Obsession just like the subtitle states. You will get sucked in from the first chapter all the way to the last. Be warned though, you may not like the similarities in the book thief and yourself!
B0025KVLTM|5.0|i'm really impressed...what i think stands out the most is the early recordings (please please me)never heard george harrison's guitar like that before..the harmonys are outstanding..for those of you who think it's just LOUDER you couldn't be more mistaken..the work on this was carefully done with all the respect you could hope for...get your headphones on and enjoy the ride!!!
B000YAA68W|4.0|I have mixed feelings about the film. I heard such raves about it when it came out in theaters that I was eager to see the DVD.  I did find it very charming, due to the animation.  I don't usually like animated films, even the ones that others like, so I was very pleasantly surprised at the tremendous charm of this.  Frame by frame, the expressions on the faces of the characters, their body language, the wit and the sheer beauty of the drawings captured my attention and pulled me along.    The film is long and I broke it up into two settings.  The ending was abrupt and left me hanging.  This is where I look back at the structure of the story and find it wanting.  It is actually a narrative of the events of a young Iranian girl as she watched the political regime change in her country, then her brief stay in Austria, her return home and then her flight to Paris.  It's really an autobiography rather than a story and when viewed in that light, it's well done.  But somehow there is a \\"so what?\\" left at the end.    We don't know what happens after the girl gets out of the taxi...Will she adapt better to French society than she did to Austrian?  What happens to her parents?  etc.  There were some other questions that arose in my mind as I watched it.  Why did she end up sleeping on the streets in Vienna, when it seemed that her parents had plenty of money?.  Why did she refuse to contact them for two months and then refuse to tell them what she did there?  Were there events that weren't shown?      So anyway, structurally, as a story it doesn't hold together for me.  Its interest lies in the subject matter; it's wonderful to get a glimpse into the lives of real Iranians.  It's main charm, though, is the wonderful animation and for that I do urge people to see it.
0439023491|5.0|I thought this was a great follow up to Hunger Games and much better than the reviews lead me<br />to believe. There was enough reference to the first book (to refresh the reader) and the writing<br />lead the reader right into that visual of the entire group of characters.  I can hardly wait for the<br />third book and hope they do justice with the filming of the Hunger Games..<br />Does not disappoint!  Love it, love it!  FYI, I was turned onto this series via Stephanie Meyer and the<br />Twilight Moms website following the whole Twilight Saga.  I am 58 and have entered the world of<br />YA with breakneck speed and adoration!
0590129279|2.0|My 3 and 4 year old just tuned this out.  I thought it was a kids book, I'm 1/3 the way through, seems like some artsy thing that probably has deep social connotations or some fancy irony.  It's silly and frivolous so far.  I want to say lame, but I haven't finished it yet.  I hope it will have some redeeming value on the last 2/3 of the book.  I wish I had bought it used.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|Turtle Beach has done it again with the new x41 headsets.  This is the older brother of the x4's.  The 7.1 surround sound option is nice when games are actually made in 7.1 surround sound.  I believe the only game out there that supports 7.1 surround sound is Prototype.  The RF signal transmission is nice, which allows you to not be directly in front of the tv.  I had a problem with this though because my wireless internet signals would get crossed and would create a loud popping noise, I changed the frequency channel on my router and that fixed it entirely.  This product is more for the hardcore gamers our there, so $200 might be steep for most.  If so, go ahead and buy the x31's instead, they are $100 cheaper and work just as well.
0385333846|2.0|This is my third Vonnegut book.  The first I read was Cat's Cradle, which to this day is my second favorite book (after Catch-22).  I then tried Breakfast of Champions, which I strongly disliked.  I was hoping this book would be more like Cat's Cradle, but I'm now halfway through and it reads exactly like Breakfast of Champions (although thankfully, there are no drawings).  If you enjoyed Breakfast of Champions you will probably also enjoy Slaughterhouse Five.
B000002J1L|5.0|This is the second Genesis album I have bought now; the first being Selling England by the Pound.  In many ways, I prefer Nursery Cryme over Selling England.  The raw sound of Nursery Cryme is just so incredibly powerful.  Although all the songs are well-written and very enjoyable, a few soar above the rest.  The first is The Return of the Giant Hogweed.  This is probably my favorite song on the album and has some incredible writing to it.  Also, Seven Stones is a dramatic song that really makes you want to hear more of it.  Sadly, it is only 5:11 long.  The Musical Box is a great opener and the ending sounds very classical.  All in all, a very great album.
B000059XUO|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over! Brandon Lee's performance was superb! He was VERY talented and did a great job with this movie. I couldn't believe it when he was killed on set! Some still call it \\"The Curse of the Lee's\\", as his father and grandfather died young.(30's)<br />[...]
B001PPLKI0|5.0|One can't go wrong when combining Elvis and gospel.  This CD set is phenomenol and well worth the price.  You don't just listen to this music you feel it! I found my way through this album a very moving experience.  If gospel didn't persuade you to seek God before, Elvis will have you reconsidering.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|\\"The Gernsey Literay and Potato Peel Society\\" is a delicious read. In truth, I have not finished the book. I'm reading on a Kindle so I don't have any idea of a page number. The Kindle says I'm at 85%. I'm not dashing towards the ending as I did in Dan Brown's novel \\"The Lost Symbol.\\" I find now that I'm reading in smaller and smaller internals because I don't want to finish. The pleasure of the book is the experience not the ending.<br /><br />Juliet is a bright, thoughtful, and energetic heroine (if it can be said that the book has a heroine). The club members with their experiences are actually the main characters of the book with Juliet providing the exposition and catalyst for the discoveries forming the content of the book.<br /><br />Since I'm averse to stories of the horrors of war, I can assure other like minded readers they need not fear to learn the narrative, in the form of letters, covers a period of the German occupation of the little British loyalist island during WWII. Of course there is the obligatory tyranny and brutality that one would expect from the setting, but the treatment by the Germans is not the point of the book and doesn't occupy much of the content. The irony is that the club (society actually) owes its existence to the oppression of the German occupiers. It's remarkable how such a thing of beauty could be born of such evil.<br /><br />I count this book a blessing to my literary experience. It's highly recommended.
0385504225|5.0|I loved this book and could barely put it down.  Dan Brown pulls through with The Lost Symbol.  I think a lot of people are bummed out that it doesn't rank up with the Da Vinci Code.  But people, the Da Vinci Code could possibly be Dan Brown's masterpiece.  Not too many author's have a book they can call their masterpiece so Dan Brown has a lot to live up to with his follow-up novel.  If you love this genre of action and history, buy this book now.  You won't be disappointed.
B001XRLWPQ|2.0|I'm not wild about the series. Every episode I've seen has been lifted from some other show, mainly BONES.
0812550757|4.0|\\"Speaker for the Dead\\" -- the sequel to Orson Scott Card's \\"Ender's Game,\\" a science fiction novel about children being prepared for a great war with an alien race -- is the better of the two, perhaps because it is less of a children's story and appeals more to adults with deeper themes and characters who are more easily identified with.    Card creates an imaginative universe in this series. It's set many years in the future, thousands of years, in fact, after \\"Ender's Game,\\" already a futuristic tale. Humans have expanded throughout a hundred worlds, founding colonies, like Lusitania, where much of this novel takes place, a world based in Catholicism. Each world has a government, but they're also governed as a whole, with strict rules, especially regarding potential alien species, based mainly on the elimination of the Buggers in the first book.    There's themes of atonement, as Ender seeks redemption for being pivotal in bringing an end to the Buggers. Also in need of personal redemption is Novinha, a new, rich character who keeps secrets from everybody surrounding the death of someone close to her.    Card brings much depth to Novinha. She's distant, even to her children, somewhat afraid to open her heart again. She's stubborn, but she also has a great heart that makes her a little vulnerable.    As Lustiana shares its planet with an alien race known as the pequeninos, Card also explores a culture clash theme. While on the surface it's about humans' contact with aliens, it could also be about any two cultures coming together and the misunderstandings that often surface. Some xenophobia creeps in, as fear of the pequeninos develop from circumstances that take place, circumstances that may be beyond the understanding of human nature.    But, deeper than that, runs the idea of hegemony, an elite culture ensuring its place at the top by limiting knowledge to those it deems inferior. Yet Card also addresses the question of: Can an advanced culture hurt a primitive one by introducing certain ideas and technology to them?    And, while the novel covers such heavy academic ideas, readers don't have to be schooled in such topics to get enjoyment out of it. There's still an engaging story here, of which not much will be said so as not to spoil it for anyone. Despite much depth, \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" winds up being a quick read.    Much of what makes the book entertaining is its wonderful cast of characters. Ender's more mature, more layered here; he has an amazing ability to read and understand people even when relatively few words (or none at all) are spoken. It makes a lot of sense for a boy who grew up way too quickly in the first novel. There's also Jane, an AI who has instant access to limitless knowledge, but who also develops a personality that she becomes one of the most human characters; she gets jealous and offended. There's Human, a pequenino whose name becomes fitting as he becomes more human than pequenino.  There's Quim, who is devoted to the colony's rules and religion until his world is torn apart. Ela, who resents the fact that her mother doesn't see her talent, something she got from her mom. There's Olhado, who doesn't have eyes but sees more than anyone with the most vivid memories.     And many more. One minor complaint might be that there's too many characters, yet it doesn't prevent attachments from being formed.     \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" is \\"Ender's Game\\" for adults, with a richer, more complex story; it's sci-fi with a heart and soul, and an exciting story to boot.
0385504225|5.0|Like millions of Americans, I loved the DaVinci Code.  I read that sucker in 3 days! And, like millions of Americans, I was less than thrilled with Dan Brown's other titles.  So, it was with sincere trepidation that I ordered The Lost Symbol.    In a word, The Lost Symbol is FABULOUS.  I sped read it in 3 days and had to make myself put it down to get some sleep.    I highly recommend this book to DaVinci Code fans - it will thrill you to the core.
B000MZHW4A|5.0|I love the video, it is packed with action. The lead actors do a very good job of portraying the high risks of smuggling in Africa's continual civil wars.
B000002MUQ|3.0|This is a very avg VH album , The production is fine , the songs are avg , the musicianship is fantastic . SAMMY has never been inventive with his singing technique ,  this album is when he was at his plainest .  It start off with poundcake  part 2 , except its far more serious , lacking a solo n a chorus! , but it never reaches the heights of poundcake .  Cant start loving you is a very pleasent song , easy goin with a nice guitar tone , but its no why cant this be love thats for sure . its passable though.    Dont tell me , is VH s grunge attempt , very ALICE IN CHAINS , great guitar tone from eddie with a chugging , Then HAGAR ruins it with an awful screaming in the chorus , which is very hard to beleive was actually released as a single     AMSTERDAM , i love this song n rate it up with  their best , people dont like it because eddie didnt like the lyrics , sure there not mind blowing but gees VHs never  were with HAGAR . Once again great guitar , one of my faves , Hagar is quite inventive n actually ads to this song instead of blunting it , great solo to.    BIG FAT MONEY AWFUL !!! awful awful!!!! awful!!!!! terrible , how cld any sane person compare this with panama , HAGAR ruins this gees this has terrible lyrics , Hagar dumbs this down big time , one of there worst .    NOT ENOUGH  is pleasent again , well written ballad ,  bit of a piano driven LOVE WALKS IN.    The rest of the album is alright , i love the instrumental , take me back , cld have been a great song instead Hagar ruined it again, EDDIE must be sick of people ruining his songs , hagar is terrible on this one .    Feelin another great song , hagars choruses  are pretty avg through this whole cd. Solo is brilliant though  .    So to sum this album up is that its one of there worst , vh being serious , never really suits , not as bad as ou812 or 2 but on par with 3 . The guitar is great through the whole album, the solos are brilliant n the musicianship is what makes this album , hagar ruins it byscreaching all the way through it , the songs arent the best either , nothing even near 1984 or 5150 , u wouldnt beleive it was the same band
B000J4QWM2|4.0|OK, I've read a lot of the lower-star reviews of this, and I'm completely floored by some of these comments. So please allow me to frame my review in the form of answering other people's opinions.<br /><br />1. \\"It's called Miami Vice, but hardly anything happens in Miami.\\" - It's called an international drug trade, people. That's why things take place in Haiti, Uruguay, Havana, Columbia, etc. These are the places that the drugs come from. In real life, the cops have to seek out these things at the source. Hell, if they were to just wait for this stuff to show up on American soil, they've lost half the battle.<br />2. \\"The action is boring and there's not enough of it.\\" - Okay, it's not that it's boring, it's just shot and performed realistically. You people are so used to being spoon-fed flashy Hollywood action scenes, with jump-cut editing and unbelievably loud sound effects, that being confronted with an actual tactical gunfight, you don't know what to do. And as for there not being enough action, do you think undercover work is all shootouts?<br />3. \\"There's no chemistry between Farrell and Fox.\\" - While they don't seem buddy-buddy, I think they have a realistic relationship. In their line of work, especially on the job, they have to be all business. Did you guys expect them to be cracking jokes and stealing each other's girlfriends? Along those lines, the number of people reviewing this that look back fondly on the \\"Bad Boys\\" movies physically disgusts me.<br />4. \\"It doesn't look like the show.\\" - What the heck do you expect, pastels, pretty sunsets, and sailboats? Does it make you mad that Crockett's pet alligator doesn't make an appearance? The way I look at it, the original Miami Vice was Michael Mann's creation, so he can do whatever he wants with the film. The fact that he chose to make a movie that really digs into what guys like this do is refreshing, rather than putting on some glitzy \\"T&A and palm trees\\" spectacle.<br />5. \\"Gong Li looks horrible and her accent is bad.\\" - First off, she is in her 40's. You don't have to look airbrushed at that age. Would you kick her out of bed? And as far as her accent, she speaks only Mandarin, so she had to learn all her lines phonetically, so give her a break!<br />6. People seem to have a problem with some of the terms the guys use. Listen, as hokey as it sounds, \\"go-fast boats\\" is actually a phrase people use to describe those watercraft. And as hokey as it may seem to hear things like \\"op sec\\" or \\"transpo\\", those are real terms used in this kind of work!<br /><br />While people say they wish it looked like the show, I think what the real problem is that it doesn't look like that apex of bad television - \\"CSI: Miami\\". Here, there's no burnt-sienna skies, no cutaways to inexplicable helicopter shots of the Miami scenery or jump cuts to bikinis on the beach, no gaudily-lit police station shots. It actually looks like Miami, for chrissakes! I was sold on the look of this movie when Crockett walks out on to the balcony near the beginning and you see the amazing deep focus of the skyline and the night sky. The fact that this was shot on digital video enabled them to capture amazing things like the clouds. I mean, look at the boat race at the beginning - it's beautiful.<br /><br />Now I won't say this is a problem-free film. I don't understand Tubb's overwrought concern for the prostitute in the club scene. And to me, John Ortiz's accent seems way to affected - it sounds like a white guy playing at being a Latino, even though John is hispanic. And yes, the fact that Colin and Gong Li's relationship is staring everyone in the face, and doesn't become an issue until later, is kinda dumb. And admittedly, a lot of inertia is lost in the middle when their relationship is being explored. But hey, every movie has problems.<br /><br />Overall, this is a much subtler film than people expected. It's got a huge budget and it was a summer movie, so that fact that it went more for reality than glitz probably underwhelmed a lot of people. While it would rank it under \\"Heat\\" and \\"Collateral\\" in Michael Mann's ouvre, I still like it. And hey, any movie that stars Colin Farrell (who usually I can't stand and who I believe is one of the most egotistical actors ever), and is still watchable to me, has got to be quite an achievment!ile it would rank it under \\"Heat\\" and \\"Collateral\\" in Michael Mann's ouvre, I still like it. And hey, any movie that stars Colin Farrell (who usually I can't stand and who I believe is one of the most egotistical actors ever), and is still watchable to me, has got to be quite an achievment!
B001FB4W0C|5.0|In my view, this is the best season of Supernatural so far. From the very beginning, the suspense is unbelievable, and the twists and turns are unpredictable and exciting. I love all the characters, each of which brings something special to the series. I absolutely recommend this product, and Amazon has it at an amazing price, at least compared to prices in Norway (which are insane). Other than that, reasonably quick delivery, no problems with the product itself - everything hunkydory.
0385504225|3.0|I am about half-way through the unabridged audio version.  The story is OK, but Mr. Brown needs to research some of his more mundane facts as well as he does his arcane facts.  Bunsen burner fuel is not a liquid.  The CIA has no arrest authority, and there has never been a Cracker Jack decoder ring, in fact there have only been about 3 decoder rings ever.  There are lots of decoders, but being children's toys, they use simple substitution codes and the size of the dials makes a ring quite large.  There was a Chex one, a Cap't Crunch one I think, and an Ovaltine one (it's huge).
031604461X|1.0|I am completely new to the Twilight universe. I never saw what the hype was from the get go, and I don't like \\"teen\\" and \\"young adult\\" novels. Give me something to provoke my nightmares.<br /><br />When I think of vampire novels, the greatest ones to my mind are, Brom Stoker's Dracula, Ann Rice's Interview with A Vampire, and Stephen King's Salem's Lot. When I first heard about Twilight, I was repulsed. How could you possibly right a \\"good\\" vampire novel if the vampires didn't slaughter people? My first introduction the Twilight universe was, oddly enough, with the movie. When I saw it, I laughed so hard my sides hurt. What was it that made this so bad? I mean the acting is below sub par, the dialogue is cheesy and unrealistic in every since of the two words. Was it the source material? After I watched it I was disgusted because my interest was piqued and I just had to know if the novel was a bad as the movie.<br /><br />To my surprise, the novel was actually pretty good. I enjoyed it, and as it ended, I found myself (rather reluctantly) wondering what was going to happen next. I went and read New Moon and Eclipse and was still not satisfied. Despite reading really bad reviews online, I decided to read Breaking Dawn anyway in the hopes that once I was finished I'd be satisfied enough to leave the Twilight universe for good.<br /><br />For that purpose, Breaking Dawn did not disappoint. I will never delve into this series again, and I'll never pick up another book by Stephenie Meyer. I loved the first three books. I'll be honest, and say that. But Breaking Dawn was horrible. Beyond horrible it was so bad it made horrible look good.<br /><br />My issues with the book were pretty much the same as everyone else. The story went from having some promise, to being a total let down. Even though I do agree with another reviewer who said Bella only gets married for sex, I was able to look past that because, after all, it is a fantasy story. My real issues were Bella's pregnancy, and Jacob Black (I never liked him at all).<br /><br />Bella's pregnancy is sure to inspire abstinence, it's that bad. Not only does Bella become pregnant (a usually impossible thing in vampire myths) but she's willing to sacrifice everything to keep the baby despite the fact that it's killing her. We're never give a good explanation of how it's possible for Bella to become pregnant either. Meyer's weak explanation is that, essentially, male vampires can still produce semen despite the fact that their bodies are dead. Edward mopes around pouting and doesn't really do much for the first half of the book after getting her pregnant, but sit there and....mope. Some husband there. The birth scene is way too explicit in my opinion. Meyer is so touchy about the sex, never giving us any good juicy details, but then she completely crosses a line with the birth of the \\"vamp baby\\". (Part of me understands that this had to be bad because Edward would never have turned Bella into a vampire any other way.) If I was a teenage girl, and even if I knew better, that scene would be enough to inspire me to either have really safe sex, or no sex at all. There's no subtlety to the pro life message. It's right there in your face. Choice life PERIOD. To hell with your choice, if you get pregnant, even if your life is at stake, you MUST have the baby anyway. Give me a break. Bella's so turned off by the idea of getting married, but wait, being a parent, that's no problem at all.<br /><br />Jacob \\"imprinting\\" on the baby is just sick in so many more ways than one. To me, this was a trite excuse to keep Jacob in the story, but make him less annoying because suddenly he's not throwing himself at Bella. His character runs off at the end of Eclipse, and in my opinion, he shouldn't have come back.<br /><br />Rosalie, a character who hates Bella from the start, becomes Bella's \\"partner in crime\\" as it were. She does nothing throughout the first half of the book but cement the pro life messageand make it all the more in your face.<br /><br />The worst part of the story is actually after all this sickness ends. Bella finally gets what she wants, to be a vampire. But wait, through the magic of...whatever Meyer was thinking, Bella circumvents the entire \\"newborn\\" stage of vampirism, just by \\"having a strong mind\\". What a cop out, as another reviewer mentioned. The second half of the book goes by in a blur. Just boring little details of Bella's new existence.<br /><br />Literally two hundred pages from the end, we get our first taste of conflict. The Volturi are on their way to Forks to destroy the Cullens and their vamp baby. Finally there has to be some good right. WRONG. There's so much build up and then total let down. The Volturi come, and rather than just getting the fight underway, decide to be diplomatic. In the second (or so) to last chapter, a whole new character is mentioned who is (coincidentally) just like Bella and Edward's baby. He comes in, has a few paragraphs of dialogue, and then the Volturi leave. That's it. According to Meyer's website, if a fight had broke out with the Volturi, there would have massive casualties on both sides of the line. Personally, I think I'd have been okay with that. At least all the build up wouldn't have been for nothing. And, okay, so Bella dies, so Edward dies, a little bit of drama is better than the actual ending. As another reviewer noted, this story was written for Meyer. In that case, it should never have been published. The ending with Eclipse, while incomplete in someways, was more satisfying. The really story ended there for me. This book is garbage and I'm embarrassed I wasted my time or my money to read it.<br /><br />This book was horrible, and didn't not live up to it's predecessors. The first books were a great ride and I had fun reading them, but this one just left a sour taste in my mouth about the story all together. With this book, I lost any taste I had for the Twilight universe and Stephenie Meyer.st part of the story is actually after all this sickness ends. Bella finally gets what she wants, to be a vampire.

B0025KVLRO|5.0|I was so glad that they released the First Four in Stereo.  I just remembered being disappointed in 1987 when they were in mono.  I tried to give them a chance.  It just didn't get it.  During the time, Mobile Fidility Sound Lab (MFSL) released in 1978 The Beatles British Cataloge The Master Recordings. People who have this, played them one time and burned them to a CD-R and captured the greatest stereo sound I ever heard.  The review is pretty much the same review a gave for WTB 2009 Remastered.<br /><br />I compared PPM MFSL CD-R to the PPM 2009 Remastered.  On the CD-R, the seperation was a little better. On the musical instrument channel (left) you can just bareley hear the vocals with a slight echo in it. Going to the 2009, the echo is a little bit louder (not much), but the base is turned up a little bit more, in my opinion, it made the songs a little stronger, and on some the songs, I noticed they were about half a second longer (sorry to be picky).  Also, I'm glad they used the mono versions of Love Me Do and P.S. I Love You, where the MFSL CD-R used the 'electronic rechanneld' version. It sounds like it is coming out of a small radio.<br /><br />I've been a Beatle fan since 1975. My ears have been customed to these song and I just pick up on these songs.  I'll Never Get Tired Of Them.<br /><br />Five Stars For Please Please Me.
B002C6K7N0|3.0|Let me start by saying that I am one of the biggest Megadeth/Dave Mustaine fans around; that being said, I am absolutely shocked at the amount of 5 star reviews being thrown around for \\"Endgame.\\" Endgame is solid, but if \\"Rust In Peace\\" is 5 stars, there is no way Endgame comes close to that ranking. I would love to be able to give 5 stars to this album, but that wouldn't be an honest review. To me 5 stars is perfect, 4 is damn close to it, and 3 is solid, but not great. Endgame surely won't let megadeth fans down: it's chock full of solos, riffs, and enough melody to catch your ear. The problem is that there are no riffs or solos that are truly memorable like peace sells, Holy Wars, Tornado of Souls, Symphony of Destruction, etc.. Chris Broderick is an absolutely amazing lead guitar player, but again none of his solos are as memorable or entertaining as Marty Friedman's or even some of Mustaine's best solos like My last words, wake up dead, the conjuring, mechanix, etc.. In fact some times the solos on Endgame sound a bit masturbatory. Instead of providing a review for the whole album, I'd rather go track by track.    1. Dialectic Chaos 10/10. I can't think of a better way to start off a Megadeth album - the likes of which haven't been heard since \\"so far, so good...so what!\\" A great instrumental song full of ripping solos from Broderick and Mustaine.    2. This Day We Fight! 7.5/10. After Dialectic Chaos, this song ids thrown right in your face. While it's truly a great metal song,the lyrics are a little weak and the music sounds a bit basic and boring to me (a common theme on endgame).    3. 44 Minutes 7/10. A slower paced song with some good solos and a very catchy singable chorus - fits in nicely, but again, the lyrics are a bit weak and there is nothing truly great about this song.    4. 1320 7/10. Musically, this is one of the strongest songs on the album, but the lyrics are just plain cheesy! This song reminds me of \\"502\\" and \\"Moto Psycho\\" - both of which sucked. I don't want to hear about driving fast in a car - not megadeth. However, the intro riff and the solos are absolutely awesome and it's worth listening to just for that.    5. Bite the Hand 8/10. Better lyrics with a chunky rythym reminiscent of \\"the scorpion\\" but not as good. Cool solo, but like many others on endgame, the rythym changes pace to accomodate the solo - I'd rather have the solo fit with the already established core rythym of the song, but hey, it's cool.    6. Bodies 8.5/10. Love this song, it really seems like it could fit in with Countdown to Extinction, this song has the classic megadeth groove that you just can't get enough of. Then when you think it's getting boring, the song bursts into a blast full of solos that is sure to please any fan.    7. Endgame 8/10. Like few songs on the album, this one has thought-provoking lyrics, which is a definite plus. The music hear is pretty solid, with some thoughtful leads that really add some color to the song - one of the better songs on the album.    8. The Hardest Part of Letting Go... 7/10. Doesn't really fit on the album, but I like it. Decent rythym and good soloing.    9. Head Crusher 8/10. Musically this song kicks ass, lyrically it's kinda bad; the music is so good that I just have to give it an 8/10. The solo at the end is one of Broderick's best on the album.    10. How the Story Ends 8/10. I love this song! It's got a really catchy rythym, a very cool catchy chorus and awesome solos, what more could yo ask for?    11. The Right To Go Insane 8/10. Most people are going to disagree with me about ranking this song so high, but I think it's awesome. A simple groove - oriented catchy rythym with Mustaine ranting about going nuts a' la sweating bullets - also some really good soloing.    To summarize, Endgame is closer to 3 1/2 stars than 3 - it's solid. If you're a Megadeth fan - buy it, you will enjoy it. Just don't expect anything truly classic like RIP, Peace Sells, or Countdown - it's just not that good, but then again, how many artists make their greatest music 25 years into their recording career? At least Mustaine and Company are still on top and still better than Metallica!

1400063515|5.0|What the author has exposed in this book should have been obvious. But it's  because we as a modern people are highly programed to think and respond as a herd( for lack of a better word)is the reason we don't readily see all the possibilities.At times he(the author) tend to come off as being sarcastic as if he's toying with with our(collectively speaking)simple mindedness.Overall,if you are honest with yourself this book can be enlightning and even provocative. Excellent peice of work!
B00004SZWD|5.0|I love this Double LP and extra EP for so many reasons, but one of the most relevant is that each song reminds me of periods of my life as i was growing up.  It seems Stevie was taking all of us on a trip down memory lane with him and i found myself being familar with each of the stops along the way. One of the Greatest Compliments i've heard concerning this album was from Elton John. He stated that this was the greatest album of all time and even to this day whenever & wherever he travels, \\"Songs in the Key of Life\\" travels with him.  This album took just over 2 and 1/2 & almost 3 years for Stevie to make and it was time well spent.  He touches just about every different genre of music in popular music.<br /><br />The lyrics are thought provoking, the music compositions are wonderfully crafted & the vocal arrangements are other worldly.  There are many highlights from the standards \\"Sir Duke\\", \\"I Wish\\", \\"Summer Soft\\" & \\"Isn't She Lovely\\" to the lyrical masterpieces like \\"Village Ghetto Land\\", \\"Ordinary Pain\\", \\"If It's Magic\\" & the song that was a gift from the universe, the epic \\"As\\".  This album was so incredible that professors of music studied it and used it as examples for music theory and the construction of a song from start to finish.<br /><br />This album was yet another statement by Stevie that he along with the likes of Curtis Mayfield, Maurice White, Marvin Gaye, Sam Cooke, Bob Marley, etc. was a musical Avatar of the highest order.  He's songs were really unlike anything else and you would hear them played in the public schools (by teachers & students alike!) to movie theatres, parks, parties, radio and even in church's!<br /><br />He Truly is a Genius in every since of the word and this was his hallmark album, the one everyone would know him by the world over!  I sometimes wonder if people truly understand the relevance of this record, Stevie had been for years stifled by Berry Gordy in the 1960's from expressing his full genius and although he had obtained artistic freedom at the beginning of the 1970's and produced some of the most incredible music the world had ever heard up to this point, Songs In The Key Of Life is Stevie Wonder truly BEING Stevie Wonder.  The freedom artistically he grants himself on this album is monumental.  Most of the equipment he was using was state of the art and had not been a part of the normal recording sessions up to that point.  He also used allowed new and inventive ways of recording the album that was ahead of it's time.<br /><br />This album was awarded the Grammy for Album Of The Year, the 3rd such honor he received in a 4 year period.  He was in a horrible car accident after which prohibited him from releasing a record in 1975.  That year Paul Simon won the Grammy for Album Of The Year and in his acceptance speech thanked Stevie for not releasing an album that year and giving someone else a chance at winning the award.  That tells you how much Stevie had seperated himself from his contemporaries.  He truly was and still is in a League Of His Own.beginning of the 1970's and produced some of the most incredible music the world had ever heard up to this point, Songs In The Key Of Life is Stevie Wonder truly BEING Stevie Wonder.

B0019X3YXM|1.0|In MY SASSY GIRL, Elisha Cuthbert plays Jordan Roark, an annoying and manipulative drunk who supposedly charms nice guy Charlie Bellow (Jesse Bradford) by ordering him around, passing out in public places and insisting on various \\"high-spirited\\" activities.  None of this looks like much fun (and Charlie frequently tells his college roommate how un-fun it is).  But Charlie can't help himself, 'cause, gosh-darn it, he's fallen in love.<br /><br />What's the \\"painful secret\\" that has turned Jordan into such a hellion?  It's not hard to guess.  And it hardly justifies her stupid behavior, or Charlie's patience with her.  By the time the \\"painful secret\\" is finally revealed, there's just time for some painful dialogue about \\"destiny\\" and a painful wrap-up that only underscores how stupid Jordan was to keep her secret for so long.<br /><br />MY SASSY GIRL is a remake of what we're told was a \\"highly successful\\" Korean film.  My suggestion: The US version would probably make more sense for English speakers if they dubbed in the original Korean soundtrack and left off the subtitles.
B00005QZH2|1.0|Not only was this CD Fantastic - So was the supplier !!!! They estimated 3 weeks delivery & I received it in 10 days (from Austrailia, no lees !!!!)    I highly recommend to any one who likes Authentic Latino Music
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I have been a huge fan of the show from its first episode.  Supernatural has literally become part of my weekly routine.  Now, in its fifth season - Sam, Dean and Bobby feel as if they are members of the family.  Season Four is a must own along with Seasons 1-3.   The writing is excellent and the fraternal chemistry between the stars is perfect.  I honestly have to thank the writers for introducing me to some of the best music that somehow I missed growing up:  Boston, Kansas, Asia, Foreigner, etc.  Itunes owes Supernatural millions!  Buy this set and support this cast.  Whenever Supernatural ends, it will literally feel as if I have lost a member of the family.  Thanks for the wonderful years of enjoyment!
B00004S367|5.0|MUSIC OF MY MIND is Stevie Wonder enjoying Creative Freedom for only the 2nd time, the 1st being his independently made album WHERE I AM COMING FROM made a year prior to this release.  He had finally got his demands met from Motown and this was the product of that hard fought victory. I have to agree with Rickey Wright's statement that this album had profound implications on how music would be understood and recorded from then on.  Stevie is one of the few artists whose experimentations in the studio would transcend and change the entire landscape of music as a whole.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that a 21 year old wrote, arranged, performed, produced & played most all of the instruments on these songs.  Although Stevie had been a hit making, chart topping machine up to this point, the music he released beginning in 1971 was were we truly realized what type of Master we were dealing with.  I think more than any other of his releases, this singulary work is the one to point back to when one talks about millions of young men and women picking up multiple instruments and learing how to create compositions that where a complete display of their musical talents.  Prior to this point, it was almost unheard of for one person to be both the singer, songwriter and \\"band\\" in and of themselves, Stevie was just that!<br /><br />And this coinsided with advancements in equipment and studio recording that he was able to take full advantage of and kind of was a \\"tester\\" of sorts to lead the industry into the new sounds of the 1970's.  The magnitude of the culmination of these things can't be overstated.  The landscape of music was changing and Stevie was one of the primary forces directing the ship and steering it in the directions it was headed.<br /><br />\\"Love Having You Around\\", \\"Love Every Little Thing About You\\", \\"Sweet Little Girl\\" are songs were we see a young man free of the bonds of just \\"hit making\\" and allowed to express the full scope of his dreams, passions and desires. \\"Girl Blue\\" & \\"Keep on Running\\" showcase this man's incredible musicianship (check out the amazing & funky clavinet work on Keep On Running). \\"Superwoman (Where were you when i needed you)\\" & \\"Evil\\" are two of the most powerful on the record and are epics that testify to his true lyrical genius.  I especially love the tempo changes in Superwoman, these are very intricate and not easy to pull off and he does so effortlessly.<br /><br />This is a Great Album and the beginning of what would become known as the \\"Golden Era\\" of his career and in many ways music in general.  It is one of my personal favorites by Mr. Wonder and one of the many reasons Stevie was/is one of the single most important artists in music history whose songs, like the greats before him, will be played into eternity.  And that is truly the measuring stick used when discussing the greatest of all time.<br /><br />This is truly were music began to make a monumental shift and what I like to call \\"Super Artists\\" were taking center stage.  Those who could write, compose, sing, arrange, play and produce their own music making for more cohesive thoughts and truly highlighting the concept behind an album.  Concept albums were, incorrectly, only thought to be a product of rock/pop but people like Stevie, Maurice White, Marvin Gaye, Curtis Mayfield and Bob Marley were about to forever change that idea.

B000002A3T|4.0|PF fans are so funny; It's not PF w/o Roger, this one sucks, not a great album, etc. This disc is a good example. The songs are great, the playing solid, but a lot of negative reviews. JUST LISTEN TO THE MUSIC PEOPLE!!! If you want to get all wound up, become a Rush fan.......
B0021L8UVC|4.0|(EDIT: This review was originally posted September 28, 2009 for the Theatrical Release of PANDORUM.  For some reason Amazon has removed the picture and URL to that movie: [[ASIN:B002QW7ALM Pandorum]])<br /><br />They don't have 4.5 stars, so I guess I have to round down although this is one of the best movies I've seen this year.<br /><br />We went to this expecting a movie rendition of Dead Space with lots of gratuitous gore and a little bit of story on the side (I wanted to go for the Sci-fi aspects and was prepared to avert my eyes, er... bite my girl on her ear during the really gory parts).  What a pleasant surprise this was!  It turned out to be more of a psychological mystery-thriller than a slasher, the story was meatier than the gore and the sci-fi was plentiful enough to satisfy my geeky appetite!<br /><br />I'm not saying it isn't spooky (I made my wife put her hands in her own lap after about 15 minutes) but the scary aspects are outweighed by the other devices in the movie so that I would not label this as a horror flick (although it does graphically show the all-time most horrifying way to wake up from a deep sleep).<br /><br />You do need to pay attention to the dialogue and visual cues in the movie if you want to understand most of what you are seeing, so plan on focusing and listening and be ready to answer a possible question or two from your movie-buddies if they miss a clue, especially towards the end.<br /><br />There are only two negatives: First, it takes the protagonist so long to settle in with other characters that there isn't much time to develop them to a comfortable level (and I would have loved to see Nadia better fleshed out).  Second, there was only one real inconsistency that bothered me, but it might not be an inconsistency... I need to watch the movie again, listen closely to the relationships in the timeline story when it suddenly floods the screen, and do some math (it would be a spoiler if I told you what it is).<br /><br />Pandorum was a satisfying sci-fi movie experience worthy of a cinema ticket and I recommend it to anyone who loves sci-fi, can tolerate a bit of gore and likes movies that push them into philosophical conversations and debates.orthy of a cinema ticket and I recommend it to anyone who loves sci-fi, can tolerate a bit of gore and likes movies that push them into philosophical conversations and debates.
0786838655|5.0|This was a very good book. Not only was this book good, but all the others are as well. This series was much better than the Harry Potters for sure, and I only bring that up because both series appeal to the same age group and are comparable in that the main character is a young boy with a huge prophecy to fulfill. The Greek mythology mixed with nowadays is fun and exciting. Your imagination really takes off and you find yourself captivated by the fast and exhilarating pace. you never feel like your reading a bunch of useless information and the characters are very well developed and believable. i would definitely recommend this book for everybody not just kids. The humor, horror, anger and sadness are very well mixed so you get a story that totally immerses you.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This band is best compared to Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The mayhem that can come across in their music is only comparable to the Beatles. Re-listen to the White Album or Abbey Road for the musical touchstones. Yet, they play as a group, each with a valuable contribution to make. [...]. Asked where the name Arcade Fire came from, the answer is a mere rumor that a college arcade burned down. [...]    Rock on Arcade Fire, may you stay away from drugs, the death knell of all other great artists, and long may you reign as the new kings and queens of music. [...]    If you have ever been in a school band you can truly appreciate how they operate fully as a musical group with a great front man and woman. Every person is into the performance and it rivals the Beatles. I swear, listen to a Beatles record. The writing is just as great too. I never would have imagined that such a group would come into existence because of all the continual BS in the music industry. I thought it might be John Lennon back for another go, except Win was born a month before John's untimely demise. Listen to them and go back to a time when music had meaning. Somebody is here again.
1416594787|5.0|Got this book over the weekend - and as with all good books, I could not stop reading it until I finished it. As the title says this book presents solid evidence for evolution. Good students of biology would not find much that is new here - except for some trivia. For others like me however, this is a great tour into evidence of evolution.This book has the same effect on me that great movies do. I can't help but day dream about it, long after I finished reading it.          This is not mentioned in any reviews yet, but I think Dawkins is more persuasive in this book than his usual self. Reading this reminded me of reading Sagan's \\"The Demon Haunted World\\". I will continue reading Dawkins as long he writes. Go Richard!
1401201911|4.0|When I first looked at this coy of Red Son I was afraid I stumbled upon a poor reversal of Superman's roles. But I thought Amazon reader's reviews couldn't have been so wrong. I started reading it and by the end I was glad I bought it. Great scenario and an interesting combination of smart villains and political satire. The graphics nicely enhance the scenario. It's a good looking comic with a nice story and a very nice ending in my opinion. If you're reading this review I recommend you get the deluxe edition. I bought the soft cover just before I saw there was a hardcover available. It would have added a nicer feeling to it.
B000VWYJ8Q|5.0|saw the movie myself but bought it for one of my daughter's they watch it often and love it
B0026ZNL7Q|5.0|I've been a fan of Riverside since their 2003 album \\"out of Myself\\". This album sees them change their style a bit, without losing their identity. Compared to their earlier albums, this one is a bit more \\"metal\\" and a bit more technical, but still has the more atmospheric elements reminiscent of Pink Floyd.    Anno Domini High Defnition is relatively short, at 44:44, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. There are no filler tracks on this album or songs extended for no reason other than to make them longer - every song is excellent in itself. Overall, this is probably the best album I've heard this year, and highly recommended for anyone who likes Riverside, as well as fans of groups like Porcupine Tree, or progressive metal in general.    The DVD is a nice bonus - obviously lower budget than an independent DVD would be, but an opportunity to see what the band are like live. It's not necessarily something I'd watch again and again though.
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|Wow. The  70s  was  probly  a  great  year  for  cat  culture. You  had  Robert  Crumbs  Fritz  the  Cat  becoming   a  hit  movie, Morris  the  cat  become  a  spoke  person  for  9  Lives  cat  food. Garfield  make  it  daybut  in  the  sunday  newspapper. Mary  Tylor  Moore  starts  her  own  television  company  called  MTM   with  that  cat  in  it.  And  Then  you  had  Aristocats. But  I  remember  seeing  this  when  it  was  aired  on  a  Toledo  station  in  Toledo  Ohio. To  be  honest  here. This  happends  to  be  the  funnest  disney  movie  I  have  ever  seen. Infect  this  is  the  oney  Disney  movie  I  would  watch  over  and  over  again. What  else  is  there  to  love  in  a  movie. Great  music,  great  lines,  and  great  voices  of  chators  done  by  the  best  actors  and  actresses. So  who  did  the  voices  in  this  movie? Phil  Harris  who  did  the  voice  of  Thomas  O  Malley,  also  did  the  voice  of  Baloo  the  bear  in  The  Jungle  Book  and  Big  John  in  Robin  Hood. Stering  Halloway   who  did  the  voice  of  Roquefort  the  mouse  also  did  the  voice  of  Winning  the  Poo  in  those  Winning  the  Poo  movies. And  the  guy  who  does  the  voice  of  Scat  Cat, Doesent  it  sound  like  voice  of  that  guy  who  played  Turkle  the  night  guard  in  One  Flew  over  the  Cookoo  Nest  and  Dick  Hallorann  in  The  Shinning,  and  Chico  and  the  man. Its  great  famly  entertainment  with  no  vilonts. The  Butler  guy  sure  gives  me  the  the  creeps  in  a  funny  way. Now  why  isnt  that  guy  working  for  The  Adam  Family? But  I  do  love  the  ending  when  Roquefort  tell  the  horse  The  End  and  horse  says  I'am  the  leader  and  I  will  tell  you  when  it  The  End, The  word  The  End  appears  on  the  screen  and  the  horse  says  The  End
B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|Again A-ha makes great music!  A must buy for a diehard fan or someone just getting started.  I would recommend it to anyone who is open and interested in listening to new music.  After 24 years, the band considered a one hit wonder in the United States, is still making great music.  I would also recommend other albums such as Hunting High and Low, Scoundrel Days, East of the Sun West of the Moon, Stay on these Roads, Minor Earth Major Sky, Lifelines, Memorial Beach, and Analogue.  I would also encourage you to see them in concert or watch their Vallhall DVD.  They are incredible live!!!
0142410705|4.0|This book is dripping with voice and humor.     Under normal circumstances, teen fiction that \\"drips with voice\\" is usually a red flag for \\"horribly written.\\"    For example, Meg Cabot.    However, this book is extremely original, funny, well written, and even informative at some parts.     Hassan has got to be one of my favorite characters ever written. He. Is. Hilarious.     The footnotes don't get annoying, nor do they get less interesting.     Buy it. Read it. Love it.     Not because it's by John Green. As a matter of fact, forget it's John Green. It's frustrating how people that have no literary experience will read his books, and just because he's John Green, they'll love it and the next thing you know, he'll be the next \\"Twilight.\\"    Definitely surpasses Paper Towns, and Looking for Alaska holds a close second. :)
B000SO7OMA|5.0|As a Loreena McKennitt fan I have several of her cds.  After watching the Alhambra concert on PBS (beyond the time when you could call and place a pledge) I decided I just had to find this concert in the cd/dvd form.  When I 1st looked on Amazon they did not have it.  Looked several weeks ago and \\"surprise,\\" there it was.  Couldnt wait to buy it, and the price was fantastic!  What a beautiful setting for the concert, I appreciate the dvd experience as I can watch and listen at the same time.  I also love the cds, makes it available to me while I drive.  This is my favorite product from her yet!

B000YPUF9W|3.0|This was easily one of the worst movies I've seen, and the worst Resident Evil movie ever made.<br /><br />This series needs a serious \\"reboot\\" and Paul S \\"Mediocrity\\" Anderson Needs to get far far away from it. Main characters that came off so well from the last movie are killed off without rhyme or reason in some anti climatic zombie rush fest. The plot has absolutely nothing to do with any of the games, and Mill jovininich phones in her performance as an Angry Alice.<br /><br />You'll notice the second movie was very very close to the second game and it was still awesome for people who may have not played it. Directors like Paul seem to think they need to deviate from the games so \\"regular\\" audiences can relate to it, but that is such BS. If you tell a good story in the established game world, they'll come no matter what. I'm baffled why we couldn't have had a code veronica movie, or even a RE Nemesis movie and why we got this mediocrity.<br /><br />This is defintely a rental and not a purchase, unless you're just looking to complete your collection. You're money is probably better spent on the new CG movie RE: Degeneration than this.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I should begin with saying that I was 10 years old in 1970, when The Beatles' breakup was announced and when LET IT BE was first released...Meaning that I am not a Big-Chill, First-Half Baby Boomer but a Second-Half Boomer (i.e, we were the teens of the 1970s).  So, admittedly,  I lack the pungent adolescent/early adult associations with this music which color the memories of those who came before me.<br /><br />Their first impressions of these songs were, no doubt, indelible - especially if, at the time,  the sadness and valedictory mood of the title song and \\"The Long & Winding Road\\" were part of an emotional \\"closure\\" upon learning of The Beatles' end...Perhaps for them it was a plea for ACCEPTANCE, of this and other losses :  to \\"put away childish things,\\" let go of unrealistic hopes, say goodbye, and move on.  It's even possible that, in \\"The Long and Winding Road\\",  Phil Spector's added quasi-Wagnerian strings, choir, and harp glissandi became part of their \\"acceptance\\" - and something they now resent being tampered with.  And God knows...In the late 60s/early 70s, with the dashing of so many immediate hopes for a new & better world, there was quite enough loss to \\"accept\\"  : the assassinations; the prolongation of the Indochina War; the beginning (had we but known it) of our economic decline into inflation and debt; not to mention the sheer number of rock & roll greats who snuffed themselves out before their time -  AND the breakup of The Beatles !!!<br /><br />But the overdubbs struck my innocent 10-year old ears (and, almost 40 years on, strike me now) as overdone and fitting the music awkwardly. I even thought that the tunes had done to them (unsuccessfully) what was done (successfully) to Charlie Brown's sad little Christmas tree.  And the sound of the original LP always struck me as muddy - and not necessarily because some kind of \\"muddy / garage band\\" sound was being gone for.<br /><br />So at least half the reason for my \\"five stars\\" is the sound quality : not at all antiseptic, it is warm, sounds like a real band, and now we hear these tunes without the heavy, soupy Spectorizing. And yes, the songs ARE strong enough without it; after all, they were conceived as not needing it. On a smaller scale, it is not unlike viewing the newly restored Sistine Ceiling - even if, to this day, some art experts  remain nostalgic for the old, discoloring protective varnish.<br /><br />And \\"to give the devil his due,\\"  the Spectorized LET IT BE was not such a disaster as another infamous overdubbed LP of that time, THERE I SAID IT AGAIN (where some 1940s Nat King Cole Trio sides were overdubbed with strings and reverb).<br /><br />Now, I leave it to Beatle-ologists to compare the different mixes and takes used on NAKED, the original LP and ANTHOLOGY 3. No doubt there are many who consider ANY inter-take splicing as a betrayal of the original \\"no overdubb\\" idea.  I believe John Lennon's exact quote, addresed to (Sir) George Martin, was \\"none of your production rubbish.\\"  This seems to imply \\"no overdubbed instrumentals and vocals,\\" which hardly rules out ALL editing or using the best takes or passages  available.  To go even further : with the anticipated presence of so many hours of \\"raw\\" film and tape footage, I would humbly suggest that SOME kind of \\"editing\\" from the best takes and passages was inherent to this \\"project\\" from the get-go. And I would only see this as a \\"betrayal\\" if later, slicker takes or fragments of a different sound and feeling had been interpolated onto something live and more energetic. But if the \\"joins\\" are not jarring, and all the material is of the same time, place, and level of feeling, and if the songs themselves do NOT suffer from it...then who's betraying whom?  After all, on a finished disc, even the exact beginning and end of tracks involves \\"editing.\\"<br /><br />Anyhow, in sheer musical terms - as opposed to mere technical \\"slickness\\" - every tune on NAKED strikes my ears as being and soundingbetter than before.  Case in point : Sir Paul's \\"yeah-yeah\\" tag, at the end of the Spectorized  \\"Long & Winding Road\\".  Sorry to skewer anyone's sacred cow, but given Sir Paul's  supreme mastery of pop lyricism and projection, I always thought the \\"yeah-yeah\\" thing came off as a bit self-conscious & affected - like an unnecessary  \\"Hmmm?\\" or \\"Right?\\" at the end of a well-spoken sentence.  This REALLY makes itself known while set, as it is,  against Spector's TANNHAUSER-Venusbergian strings, choir and harp glissandi.  But stripped of the yeah-yeah and the layed-on \\"Wagner,\\" the song is stronger and sounds more \\"natural\\" (or should I say \\"let be\\"?).<br /><br />And while I'm shamelessly skewering sacred cows (i.e., how dare I, etc. etc.), here's one more bit of ground chuck...The \\"received\\" idea that the Twickenham film dates (i.e., the first LET IT BE sessions) \\"document the breakup of The Beatles.\\"  Yes, John Lennon was supremely RIGHT when he said that the \\"feeling\\" on those sessions was \\"lousy\\" - and the film does not and cannot camoflage this.  But in the 2 to 3 years prior to those first LET IT BE sessions, the Beatles had gone through several OTHER episodes of accumulated tensions and \\"lousy feeling.\\"  Only, the Twickenham sessions were caught on film,  so it is all too easy to point to them and pontificate : \\"HERE is where the breakup really began.\\"  Whereas the overall \\"feeling\\" of the subsequent Apple Basement Studio dates, the Rooftop date, and the ABBEY ROAD dates is anything but \\"lousy.\\"  This subtle insistence on making the Twickenham dates representative of the WHOLE project is sad, because it only serves to obscure the truth...Which is that, from the Basement sessions on through the end of ABBEY ROAD, The Beatles DID go out in a rising trajectory of quality and glory.<br /><br />No doubt, it was inevitable to include the Spectorized LET IT BE in the newly remastered Beatles collection. But if it includes PAST MASTERS, it might have also included LET ITBE...NAKED. Still, NAKED is a boon and I am grateful for it.

1594202249|3.0|I understand and agree with the reviewers that suggest that \\"Inherent Vice\\" is Pynchon playing with the detective genre. But in most detective stories, you actually care about the mystery as it unfolds and each randomly introduced character contributes something to the story. Neither is the case here, nor is it the case that Pynchon will dazzle you with the language, structure or imagery that he is capable of. A lot of Pynchon is here: the vast organized conspiracy working behind the scenes, the goofy and charming character names, the sexual obsession, the bumbling anti-hero. But what isn't here is something that leaves you impressed that he has reinvented the detective story, or even presented a decent one on its own merits. If you want an easy-ish intro to Pynchon, start with \\"The Crying of Lot 49\\". If you want to be blown away, go straight for \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\". If you want to read a boring PI novel from a novelist who imagines himself as a hippie doper in 70s LA, then you'll enjoy this one more than I did.
0385504225|3.0|I looked forward to this book for a long time.  While I did read it fast, in about a week, just because it is an easy read, doesn't make it a great one.  I would compare this book to a James Patterson book (from the last ten years), short chapters, alot of suspense but very little substance.  The Da Vinci Code was packed with interesting information on the history of Christianity but this book failed to deliver on the Freemasons.  After such a long wait, I would have thought Dan Brown would have come up with something better, but it looks like he was maybe a 2-3 hit wonder.  Additionally, the protangonist of this story is just like the others of his earlier works. Yes, there was some interesting information, but it really just cut at the surface and disappointed in the end.
B0000AM6JI|5.0|A gangster in New York gets thirty years in prison. But his lawyer manages to have that reduced to five years. He is truly trying to remain clean and to make some rather honest money in a club, though he gets the necessary investment from a bad deal that had cost the life of a few people. He was only an asset to a younger dealer, a recommendation, a referee if you want, aired and exhibited by the younger one.<br /><br />But that younger one was dealing with young gangsters and of course they tricked him into dying, losing his money and getting nothing, except that Carlito puts things right, to his own and sole benefit. But he has to deal with a vast Italian family in his club and outside. The main twist in the plot is that the lawyer who rescued him out of prison had been dealing with these gangsters, and this family in particular, even trapping one in prison after appropriating the million dollars this particular gangster had made in his business. But a lawyer will always be an amateur gangster and he drags Carlito into the last act of his own drama.<br /><br />That will cost their lives to the lawyer, Carlito and half a dozen members of the family in the brilliant setting of Grand Central Station. At the very moment when he could have walked out of this life of outcast crime, he is reminded that the leash that is attached around his neck will never disappear. This film has some depth somewhere about the great ease with which honest people can become dishonest, and at times with the idea that they are not dishonest since the people they steal or rob are thieves themselves.<br /><br />The code of the street is all powerful and definitely stronger than any law imaginable. The film is brilliant too as an action film, even, this time with suspense and great actors, Al Pacino being doubled up by Sean Penn. Brilliant rendering of the dilemma of a drug lord turned old and would-be honest.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

Each season is better than the one before but this one is just perfect, everything is great. And there's Castiel (this angel is too cool.lol). And some great great episode (Yellow fever is one of the best).  I watched it in less than a week while here in France the season 3 had just been broadcast. Can't wait for the Fitfh season !
B0000AMRJD|5.0|Don't let yourself be lured by the picture of the poor Cubans under the dictatorship of Fidel Castro who is kicking them out of the island. It is hinted these exiled people are far from being clean. They are the dregs of society and coming directly out of prison. Scarface is no exception. He is scum and scum he will remain till the end. The Americans are not lured at all, at least the police, but they are under strong pressure to provide these poor refugees with \\"libertad\\". As soon as Scarface gets that freedom he starts his business, from scratch and from the bottom, but he knows how to climb fast and how to get rid of obstacles and his road is punctuated with bodies or parts of bodies. In no time at all he is the boss and he is able to realize his ambition: millions from the opening Colombian route (cocaine of course) whereas those he eliminated to get in their place were only making a few grands. But the story of this man is the story of a paranoid and schizophrenic sociopath. He climbs to power and cannot see he has to share that power with newcomers. He defends his territory like a lion or a grizzly bear and his power becomes a war, a constant war in which everything and everyone is destroyed. That makes a perfect action film full of violence as if it were loaded with cocaine, but with a more human dimension in the character of Scarface himself who is impersonated marvelously by Al Pacino. The acting is so good that it transcends the pure bloody violence of the images and the plot. We can admire how Brian de Palma paints and composes his character to make him so true to what we can believe. He becomes a masterpiece in that psychological line in spite of the total absence of any other depth, social, cultural, political or whatever.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID

0061134007|5.0|(4.5 stars)  Norway's relationship with the Nazis, from World War II to the active neo-Nazi movement of the present day, infuses this thriller with dramatic action scenes as Inspector Harry Hole tries to protect the motorcade of four world leaders who have come to Norway for a conference. President of the United States Bill Clinton, Vladimir Putin of Russia, Yasser Arafat of the PLO, and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak arrive in Oslo for talks in an atmosphere filled with neo-Nazi speeches and the sensational trial of Sverre Olsen, a neo-Nazi leader, who blames every problem Norway has had since 1945 on enemies of National Socialism.<br /><br />Norway was occupied by Germany in April, 1940, and when the Norwegian royal family fled to England, a puppet government, working with the Nazis, was installed.  In the midst of harsh economic conditions, many young men from Norway were recruited by the Germans to fight on the Eastern Front against their enemies, the Bolsheviks. All these men (and some women who had served as nurses) were tried for treason upon their return to Norway after the war, when the legitimate government was reestablished in 1945.  Most were sentenced to three years in Norwegian prisons.<br /><br />The long-term resentments of these now-elderly Norwegian veterans of the Eastern Front who were branded traitors in 1945, combine in 1999 with the ultra-conservative political agendas held by many Norwegian young professionals, and the still-flourishing neo-Nazi party, all of which join to create an explosive political and social environment which award-winning Norwegian author Jo Nesbo develops into a thriller full of hatred, violence, and mayhem.  Creating parallel narratives, Nesbo alternates the battles of Norwegian soldiers on the Eastern Front, with the everyday battles of Inspector Harry Hole to preserve order in Oslo against those who sincerely believe that \\"In His wisdom God so ordained it that an inferior creature is never happier than when serving and obeying a superior creature.\\"<br /><br />Creating lively characters from the two different chronologies, Nesbo creates an almost infinite series of vibrant, interconnected mysteries.  Five repeating characters from the war share their stories and their tragedies, and most are still alive in Norway in 1999, when the novel opens, full of resentments, angry at the direction they see the country taking, and close enough to death that they have little to lose in seeking revenge.  Inspector Harry Hole, who is further developed in NEMESIS, is an alcoholic loner who is his own worst enemy. When a rare Marklin rifle is used in several shootings, Hole  begins to deal with elements of the international arms markets, which further complicates the mystery.  Nesbo creates some of the most intricate, carefully plotted thrillers ever written.  Every detail is connected by the end of this book, but the reader gets a non-stop intellectual workout keeping track of the ins and outs of the characters, their problems, and their potential enemies, and the conclusion challenges everything the reader remembers as it ties up the loose ends. n Mary Whipple<br /><br />[[ASIN:0061655503 Nemesis]]<br />[[ASIN:0061133973 The Devil's Star: A Novel]]<br />[[ASIN:B001V7V8GG The Redeemer (A Harry Hole Mystery)]]ng a superior creature.\\"      Creating lively characters from the two different chronologies, Nesbo creates an almost infinite series of vibrant, interconnected mysteries.

B001TOD9VI|5.0|I waited a long time to finally watch this film and I'm sorry I didn't get around to it sooner. The realistic depiction of a washed-up has been done before in cinema and literature but what sets this film apart is how involved the viewer gets in the world. Despite not necessarily loving \\"Wrestling\\" and entering watching this film with some reservations, I found myself becoming in love with this film as it progressed. While it doesn't have the crowd-baiting splendor of \\"Slumdog\\", instead relying on a grittier feel to relay it's story, it does fully involve the viewer to the point that you can't help but feel exquisite pain as \\"Ram's\\" story evolves. With a strong central cast that certainly deserved the nominations that they received, this is a film that should not be missed by anyone.
0743455967|1.0|If you want to be brow beaten this is the book for you.  It is one thing to say you will never be a good writer in person but why take negative feed back just because of a name.

0756405890|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss has created a story like no other, a story within a story within a story, without being pretentious about it.    The world he creates is like many fantasy worlds, rich of lore, different races, the eternal conflict between good and evil etcetera.   Yet where this type of story usually is very hard to make and keep interesting Rothfuss has done a marvelous job of first making us love the main character, developing him masterfully, and at the same time lifting a tip of the veil of future events by mere implications, shifting the whole good vs evil thing, toppling our belief system and preparing us for the true mystery to come.    All the while the main story keeps gettting more interesting and adventurous not by throwing in isolated elemtns of action so often used by lesser authors, but by spinning a true story, rich in every aspect and sucking in the reader.    The complete story will take up 3 books. Rothfuss had allready written the whole original story before he ever went to an editor with it, but he's now having a hard time editing the story of book 2 and 3, expanding it and making it a solid trilogy. Here is an author that wants to publish what he believes in, and I hope the next 2 books will be as amazing as the first.    If you're a fantasy fan looking for a captivating book, don't miss this one!

055358894X|5.0|I finally found another author good enough to transport me to his world. Mr Lynch creates a fantasy landscape with enough detail to be immersive, and yet enough unexplored world to keep me wondering where the next book will take me.    The main character is well developed and is constantly adapting to new experiences, feelings and influneces from the people close to him, making his person an interesting one, easy to relate to.  The balance between mischievous inclination and seriousness of the situations at hand is hard to find in most books, tending to either approach the ridiculous or lacking humour. Lynch did an admirable job of finding the middle path.    It's also a well-paced novel, no weak 30-page inner contemplations to fill the book, but real adventure that keeps you locked in the story until the last page. This is one of those books that made me annoyed for having to wiat for the next installment, and that's the best compliment I can give!    Both this book and the sequel are must-reads for any fantasy fan that likes a mix of magic, adventure and mischief.

0385504225|3.0|This is more of a sequel than previous works. The same symbolism used, the mysterious bad guy, and the lack of character development of all characters involved make me think that this was a novel not from the heart, but for a contract deadline.    It's not a bad book, it's even enjoyable to some extent, but the fact that \\"intricate\\" puzzles are solved in the exact same fashion multiple times and the fact that in the last third of the story the author clearly doesn't know how to end it, changing stancepoint on the center question of the story so often it becomes annoying and highly unbelievable, make it less than it could have been.    Mr Brown clearly has done some research, but lacked the imagination to deliver a thrilling suspenseful and immersive story, and instead provided me merely an adeqaute one to read before falling asleep at night.

0385504225|2.0|This truly is a work of fiction:    1) We know the setting is present-day, because there is constant mention of Google and iPhone - The Redskins in the playoffs?!!!!? Now THAT is a stretch.    2) At the beginning of the book Robert Langdon flies from Harvard to Dulles Airport - which is 30 miles west of Washington DC - what kind of flight path did the private jet take that afforded him to see the Washington Monument from his window? Oh that's right, that was only so Dan Brown could reveal the final destination of the book - which was completely obvious - I kept thinking to myself \\"why couldn't a HARVARD PROFESSOR put the pieces together when a simpleton like myself nailed it from the first few pages?\\" If he had just gone to there from the get-go, we could have avoided the torturous 400+ pages in-between and gotten to the pitifully disappointing ending.    Now for more bad news:    1) The true identity of the antagonist is painfully obvious - why is he so personally committed to destroying Peter Solomon? It only takes a few moments of recollection to figure that one out.    2) The \\"data backup\\" \\"twist\\" was also obvious, which left the explosion of the lab lackluster. Anyone in the technology/data sector knows you ALWAYS have an off-site backup - in fact, everyone who has lost data due to a hard drive crash would realize the importance of an off-site backup, or at least a thumb-drive. YAWN.    3) That the Architect of the Capital (forgot his name) was so compelled to protect the Mason's \\"secret\\", even at the cost of the life of his life-long friend Peter made sense - but then as soon as he saw that video, he folded. That makes no sense. That \\"damning evidence\\" was nothing compared to real-life blunders that politicians and world leaders commit. The once you realize what that \\"secret\\" really is, you'd think \\"this guy is a sucky friend - he would let me die for THAT! - he's not invited over for dinner ever again\\".    4) More on that \\"secret\\" - it's only the most widelypublished book in the world - what's so secret about that? VERY DISAPPOINTING.    5) The \\"rest\\" of the Smithsonian collection (the other 98% of the collection NOT on display, according to the book) only has 1 idoit security guard? REALLY? Thieves - take note of that!    6) They are taking the blue line! Obviously not! Come on, 30 pages were wasted on that obvious \\"twist\\".    7) I know, Robert Langdon has claustrophobia - Every situation in which Langdon encounters trouble seems to involve him being caught in a tight corridor or box....     8) Katherine Solomon, supposedly a brilliant scientist, is actually more gullible than my 2-year old son.    9) There's more...

B002BFBAWO|1.0|This movie is flat out bad. I'm not usually one to write one-star reviews, but this movie is so bad it deserves my time. First of all, aside from Kristen Stewart, the acting is terrible. Jesse Eisenburg's character is so cliche and uninteresting; and that's if you can understand him because he talks so fast. As for Ryan Reynolds, he is out of place and his acting is virtually the same as all of his other movies. The plot itself is an interesting story, but the writers failed to expound on the mystique that surrounds amusemant parks. They could have developed the characters quite a bit more and broken the stereotypes. But they didn't and we're left with an awkward college grad; a teenage girl with issues; a tease; a prettyboy dog; and the amusement park owners who are just in the movie for comic relief, all of which add up to an overused and unrealistic cast. I feel like the editors even got so bored with this movie they just kind of slapped everything together and packaged it with Kristen Stewart's and Ryan Reynolds' name knowing they would turn a profit regardless of the quality of the movie. I tried to give this movie a chance but after viewing it I was sorry I did so.
0385495323|5.0|If you guys have seen David Kahn's Codebreakers, then you must understand that the subject of cryptography is deep in variable and can be seen as one of the genius things occuring in history. However, if you prefer a smaller, quicker read, then this would definitely be it.<br /><br />You'd think that something like this would be boring with all it's mathematical structures and algorithmic matrices, and even confusing at times, but Simon Singh describes his target subject very well. You will learn of the first methods of hiding methods, and several different methods of scrambling a method. You will learn about the DES (Data Encryption Standard), and about the many people that made such things possible. You will understand that there were several political figures in the past that have used ciphers to discover someone planning to conspire against them or planning to assassinate them, and it will even give you some history on the mysterious Beale cipher that supposedly has never been solved because a key was never given, although the man given these papers successfully deciphered one of these papers with the Declaration of Independence.<br /><br />Overall, this book was a very engaging read, an excellent covered subject, and was definitely worth such explanation. I hope in the future when they create the newer and bigger Data Encryption Standard, I'm there to understand how it came about and where it originated from (Maybe being a second version of the RSA cipher (Or in simpler terms the Rivest-Shamin-Adleman cipher)).

B001G8NW6Y|4.0|Hazlitt's Economics in One Lesson is an excellent primer in Austrian school economics.  The material is sound enough to serve as an introductory college-level text, while the writing, logic, and language is accessible enough that one need not be a student of economics to find the lessons useful.  Hazlitt begins by exposing basic fallacies of taxes, wealth, and government programs and continues by exploring more specific programs such as farm subsidies and tariffs.  Hazlitt's thesis is that by focusing only on the short-term effects a particular economic policy has for a certain group one ignores the long-lasting and multi-factorial effects that policy has on any number of unseen groups who are not directly involved in the policy.  Beginning with the classic broken window fallacy Hazlitt explains in basic terms how the true effect of some economic programs is to transfer production from more efficient economic sectors to the less efficient, thereby weakening the economy as a whole.  Hazlitt's writing is effective and confident without being denigrating to those whom he argues against.  Although Hazlitt mentions throughout the text that his purpose was not to bloat the book with charts and statistics, when he employs these sorts of facts to support his arguments his presentation becomes that much the stronger and easier to understand; so, one could wish that he had chosen to use them more often.  His logic does not suffer for their absence, though, and Economics in One Lesson remains an excellent, quick read for anyone seeking a greater understanding of basic economic principles.

B002GZQYMK|2.0|Far from the tasteful hard rock of Origins of Symetry, Showbiz and Absolution, this album just sounds pretentious. The music is not very good, not very original, and not very catchy, and yet it seems to claim that it's the greatest thing you've ever heard. It's overproduced and overwhelmingly thick, with song structures that just don't make sense. In short, the whole concept of this album doesn't work. It's not even a valiant effort, it's just a total failure. I'm disappointed because I enjoyed some of their earlier work, but I'm not surprised because great bands are few and far between. Unless they come out with something amazing next time around, you can write off the Muse. Great album cover, though.

B00004BZ16|4.0|Bumped to three LPs in an effort to stick it to Bruce Springsteen, \\"Sandinista!\\" is excessive, like they say, messy, like they say, but not self-indulgent, like some say.  Definitely great.  It doesn't get old for me: I don't mind being carried off by the experimental dubs, since the obvious stand-outs, of which there are quite a few (\\"Somebody Got Murdered,\\" \\"Up in Heaven (Not Only Here),\\" \\"Broadway,\\" and \\"The Street Parade,\\" to name some of my favorites), make stalwart buoys.  Maybe if one were to cut these 36 tracks into one record's worth of songs, it might be a better album, but it wouldn't be nearly as interesting.  Call it punk's \\"White Album\\" if you have to.  I'm very happy with calling it \\"Sandinista!,\\" forgetting all the coulda-been-shoulda-been's and just letting the music play.
0679736646|2.0|I like PKD but I did not like Ukib.  The writing seemed amateurish and because of this I assumed it must have been one of his first novels (it isn't). None of the characters have any depth and in fact many are so poorly developed that they are hard to tell apart. The science fiction ideas in Ubik aren't especially interesting.  I recommend you don't bother with this until you've read Dick's other major works.
6305428352|2.0|The good: some of the acting.    The bad: everything else. Especially the titular musical work. Hordes of composition students could've hit this one out of the park, and would've done it for free, but instead they paid gobs of cash to Michael Kamen, who decided to suck. Seriously, the \\"Opus\\" he wrote as Mr. Holland's proxy, should have come in a white can w/ black letters reading \\"music.\\" In other words, generic as can be. If I spent my whole life working on that piece of trash, like Holland supposedly did, I'd stab myself in the eye with my conductor's baton.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|How did I never hear of Leonard Cohen in all my 50 years?  Well, I've heard of him now and I adore his music, his style, his poetry, his smooth, soulful, rhythmic style.  When I heard him sing \\"I'm Your Man,\\" I thought, Mr. Cohen, yes, you are!  I bought the CD and the DVD of the live show.  A welcome new experience.

B0001XAPX8|5.0|Everyone who has seen the film LAWRENCE OF ARABIA remembers how it opens with the death of T. E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole): he drives his motorcycle off a gravel road to avoid hitting some pedestrians. Similarly, THE HUMAN STAIN begins with the deaths of Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins) and his lover, Faunia Farley (Nicole Kidman): Silk drives his car off an icy road to avoid hitting an approaching pickup truck that deliberately swerved into their lane. About 98% of the subsequent parts of both films are giant flashbacks showing us the significant life-choices Lawrence and Silk made and the things they said and did BEFORE that fatal moment.<br /><br />One of these films is an affirmation, with a kind of summing up; the other is a catalyst or trigger for further thought. In the case of Lawrence, the many remaining scenes arouse our respect and admiration for a heroic historical individual. In that of Silk, we are meant to feel sorrow and compassion for a man with a hidden past--and similar feelings for his lover and for her ex-husband and for almost everyone else in this film--and THEN we are meant to generalize and begin to think about the many flaws in human nature and human society that cause so much suffering for ourselves and for the people we live among: anti-Semitism, racism, classism, ageism, snobbishness, racism, jealousy, hypocricy, cowardice, greed, distrust, racism, selfishness, sexism, puritanism, etc. etc. etc. And did I mention racism yet?<br /><br />Other reviewers have complained that THE HUMAN STAIN leaves out too many parts of Philip Roth's wonderful novel, that Hopkins has a Welsh accent (would Jeff Bridges have done better?), that the actor playing Silk as a younger man (Wentworth Miller) doesn't look or sound like Hopkins, that the love relationship between Silk and Faunia (who is half his age) is \\"creepy,\\" etc. etc. etc. For those reviewers, this film did not work; something got in the way. I am pretty certain, too, that for my late parents and for my late sister (as well as a few dozen ex-in-laws), this film would not have worked either--chiefly because of their blatant, lamentable RACISM (which many reviewers avoid discussing). One of the huge ironies of THE HUMAN STAIN is that if Silk's secret had been known to any of his fellow faculty members or townspeople, he would have been hated--and probably murdered--because of that, rather than for his (imaginary) Jewishness or for the May-December aspect of his love affair--with an uneducated \\"white trash cleaning lady.\\" (By the way, Coleman Silk's fatal relationship with Faunia Farley is bracketed for us in the movie as being somewhere between Pres. Clinton's obsession with Ms. Lewinsky and that of Achilles with Briseis, the slave girl that Agamemnon coveted in THE ILIAD.)<br /><br />While I was fully conscious of the differences between Miller's and Hopkins' portrayals of Silk, this did not bother me. I thought both actors did fine jobs with their scenes, as did Nicole Kidman (she is especially wonderful when talking with the captive crow!) and Gary Sinise (playing Nathan Zuckerman, who, at the end, is writing about Silk--and who perhaps has been, in a kind of loop, presenting us Silk's story all along, including how Silk met him). Phyllis Newman (an actress I admired forty years ago) does an excellent brief scene as Silk's wife, Iris, who suffers a fatal heart attack when he is falsely accused of being a racist, and Ed Harris is totally believable and totally wonderful as Lester Farley, Kidman's jealous, half-crazy, Vietnam-vet ex-husband (this is the best performance I have ever seen Harris give). Kudos also to Mimi Kuzyk as ambitious Prof. Delphine Roux, who viciously accuses Silk of being a racist.<br /><br />Do the five stars I gave this film mean I think it is nearly perfect? No--if I were giving it a letter grade, I would rate it about A- (somewhere around a 92 perhaps). Why this high? Because despite its flaws, it DID work for me: it made me feel strongly and care strongly about the characters and their problems and the outcomes of their lives--and it made me continue to ponder them and the broader issues the film raised, not just for a few seconds or minutes or hours, but for several days after watching it. Not many films have had that strong an impact on me. THE MISSION did, and so did A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS (both with screenplays by Robert Bolt, who coincidentally also wrote the screenplay for LAWRENCE OF ARABIA). But not many other films have had this effect--so THE HUMAN STAIN is in very good company.characters and their problems and the outcomes of their lives--and it made me continue to ponder them and the broader issues the film raised, not just for a few seconds or minutes or hours, but for several days after watching it.

B0021L8UMQ|2.0|If you buy this DVD when it comes out, be sure it has closed captions, I loved the movie and couldn't understand  most of the words spoken. With the actors broken English, soaring background music, and poor sound quality it was terribly frustrating to follow the movie. Look for the \\"CC\\" on the back of the DVD box if it isn't there... forget it, unless you want to follow a gorgeous movie as a silent film.
0765356139|1.0|As much as I enjoyed \\"Final Empire\\", I was thoroughly disappointed withe the two sequels. The utter lack of action is as painful as it is in the \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" series. The dragging on and on regarding characters' moods does not deepen our understanding of their personalities. Very few new facts and twists are added in the two sequels, and these could have been summarized in much fewer pages for a more dynamic read. Actually the entire trilogy could have been packed into one great book. The trend nowadays for fantasy writers is at minima a trilogy (if not more...).    So enjoy \\"Final Empire\\" as a self-standing book, skip the two sequels
B0012CJQY6|4.0|I planned to watch an episode per night but got hooked and watched all 13 (?) over 3 days. intelligent and yet easy to follow (unlike say the equally excellent The Wire with its myriad and multiple plots and sub-plots weaving their way through sometimes several series). The characters create a synegy with Vic the human pittbull being the star - a solid 'old school' cop playing by his own strict moral code, yeah yeah, the standard format for every 'maverick' cop series. never mind, it works. the theme tune is absolutely rubbish - the worst of any TV show EVER, whoever chose it must have been having a laugh.So glad I watched it on DVD and so was able to skip such noise.
0545123267|3.0|I would not allow anyone under 16 years of age to read.   Even then it is  questionable because of sexual topics.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|First off, I'm not one for romantic comedies. Most of the time I find the characters phony or unoriginal, the plots basic and stale. I'm very happy I rolled the dice and had my friends talk me into seeing this film. For once I found a lead in a romantic comedy I could relate to! Joseph gordon-levitt plays an indie music obsessed greeting card writer named Tom who falls for his manager's secretary, Summer(Played by the funny and beautiful Zooey Deschanel). It turns out they both love The Smiths and going to the movies and after a few awkward work oriented nights out on the town, the two start seeing each other, There's only one problem. Summer doesn't believe that true love exists, and though Tom falls further for her, Summer refuses to get attached. The film follows the 500 days of their relationship in a scattered pattern which highlight the joys and pains of making it work. Watching the two as they take a childish romp through IKEA in one scene and breakup at a dinner in the next was like watching a bitter-sweet slide show that just about anybody can say\\"yeah, I've been there\\". Aside from being a truly enjoyable love story, the film's strength is in the comedy. Tom's therapy sessions with his much younger and much wiser little sister are hilarious and his romantically clueless friends play great sidekicks. Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel have perfect on screen chemistry and they seemed comfortable and natural working together. I laughed with them and was reminded of that awful ache they call heartbreak. If you're a softy for romantic comedies then it's needless to say that you should go see it because this film brought a smile to this cynical romantic's face.
B000002UDG|4.0|I liked this product a lot.  It plays great.  The delivery took more time than I thought it would, but other than that the product itself is good.
B001MEJY8W|1.0|A very hard movie to watch.  Thoroughly unpleasant.  It is not, however, a horror movie - there is no real nervousness, or tension to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat.  I think it gets classed a horror movie as it's so incredibly gory and has so many murders and torture scenes, but it's probably more accurate to say it's of the Transgressive genre.      I was told it was a challenging movie, this is true.  I was also told the story was great and the ending made it worthwhile, this is untrue.  After watching it I read some reviews in which the reviewers raved over the film and I must say I don't understand where they are coming from.  If torture is central to the story and is done artistically, then I can handle it.  But when the torture of children and young women is gratuitous, and goes on and on with no payoff then I feel I've been made to watch something that is very emotionally trying for no reason.      Without spoiling the plot I can only say the end of the movie is very weak and feels tacked on.   I kept waiting for the few frames that would pull the whole movie together and justify the previous hour of mutilation but it wasn't there.    As far as good horror movies go, get The Descent (I'm looking forward for The Descent 2).  For a good transgressive movie get Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer.    Several people working on the movie have expressed regrets that they were involved and one of the principals even committed suicide.  Overall a dark and disturbing movie, made by disturbed people, with no payoff.  Although I support freedom of expression and am glad this movie was allowed to be made I can honestly say I wish I never saw it.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|Okay, I have seen the broadway production of this play and it was good. But, if you want to have something in your DVD drawer to watch with your daughters every few months, this is one to have. The singing is excellent for a movie and you will be singing the songs for two weeks after because they stick in your head. My girls play act for days afterwards . One will sing the Phantom's songs and the other will sing Kristy's. It is so fun to listen to them. But, the point is, if you are a father and you want to share something with your daughters that is memorable and fun, buy this and watch it with them. Yes, there are a couple of parts where the Phantom gets excited, mean, a little seductive, but it is a good movie made from an old story. So, if you want them to remember watching a movie with their father at night in the fall with popcorn and hot apple cider, this is a winner.  They will never forget it.
0670033049|3.0|Just finished reading this book.  I think it would have been much better if Steinbeck kept to one story-line of Adam and Cathy and their sons.  Chapters were written about the Hamilton and Steinbeck families which I felt had no relation to the story at all (you could skip those chapters and still understand the book). Also, I felt the dialogue between the characters during the last third of the book to have been trite and wooden, and was just filling the pages rather than saying anything really meaningful.    If Steinbeck had kept this to one main story-line rather than digressing with stories of other families, he would have written a faster-paced, SHORTER, and more interesting novel.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I enjoy her voice and the way she sings the songs, so intriguing, pleasant.  Combine this with the words of her songs...excellent.  Listen to the words  on the samples. They are not flippant, weak, meaningless rhymes/lyrics. They are deep, thought provoking and beautiful and I can relate to every song, and I am a white male! I read the words to my 9 and 13 year old daughters and we discussed Corinne's songs and the stories and thoughts she sings about. Now every time they ride in the car with me they want to hear Corinne and we sing the songs together. Their favorite is \\"Paint a picture for you.\\" We should all appreciate the simple things. Or \\"like a butterfly\\", just a beautiful and uplifting word picture. \\"Honor to Love You\\", I thought I was the only one that thought this way. Thank you Corinne Bailey Rae for giving me something else to share with my daughters.  Well done! I appreciate you.
B000Q04XDY|5.0|This book is a must for everyone who wants tot take a critical look at the 'other side of' islam. Islam is not just another religion, it's not just another faith. It really is a completely different world view, or better yet, a blueprint for a new world order. Although everything really is based upon the Koran, the islamic holy book, sinds then, the arab world has elaborated on this in an enormous way. The islam covers everything, from the moment when you are born up to your, and even after, death. I found the most shocking information, the way women should be treated in the islamic world order. Also, islam's mission to rule te world and submit any- and everything until it's all islam, i found it a frightning statement. Its all there, in the Koran, pages and pages of direct holy orders. Most people laugh it all away and find it all a bit to much, a bit ridiculous. Bit if you live in Europe, like me, its a cold hard day-to-day reality. We have had our share of totalitarianism and suppression over here. Our parents and grandparents have not shed blood for nothing. Islam is a clear and present danger to the world, especially in Europe where there already are up to 40 million immigrated muslims. In the US that number ia about 4 million, so there you see the difference immediately. Whatever you are thinking about religion in a general way, or the islam specifically, this book deservers a good read. It's full of interesting insights and challenges the reader to investigate for him/herself.
0385504225|1.0|I've read some of Dan Brown's other books including the Da Vinci code and thought for the most part it was entertaining cheese.  This book, however, is terrible.  Did he get paid by the italicized word, the improperly used ellipse and exclamation point?  If he did then he is a fabulously rich man.  The further you get along in the book, the worse it is.  I could barely finish the last chapter because every other sentence was italicized to connote the GREAT IMPORT (sorry, I don't know how to do italics on Amazon) of the GREAT WISDOM, which NO ONE HAS EVER THOUGHT ABOUT BEFORE!!!  I'm pretty sure that it's possible to discuss philosophical subjects in a way that conveys depth without having to end each chapter with an exclamation point.  Plato managed to write entire books without relying on punctuation to get his point across.    The science, history and philosophy are sloppy and ridiculous.  A man suffers a horrific accident and the hospital just lets him go after an hour or so?  With what?  A couple of Tylenol and good wishes that he doesn't become terribly infected?  A Harvard scholar who studies ancient texts claims he doesn't really know that much about the Bible?  And for the love of God (see what I did there?!!!) Einstein was an atheist and I'm pretty sure he'd appreciate it people would stop perpetuating the myth that he had some deathbed conversion to Deism.    Finally, the message that this books attempts to convey is too shallow and laughable for even Oprah to feature on one of her Secret shows.  Keep on believing in your press Dan Brown because this book makes it obvious ... THAT YOU DO!!!!!!
B002C6K7N0|5.0|This album is going back to the roots of Megadeth and is thrash/heavy metal at its best. Definitely a cover to cover album, not a single  song can be skipped.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|The Day That Never Comes    That is the only song that anyone can claim sounds like Metallica. And that only comes toward the end of the song. Anyone who was a fan of Metallica before Enter Sandman that says otherwise is fooling themselves. They are in denial. Some claim All Nightmare Long is real Metallica. No. It sounds like something left off Re-Load. Face it, old school Metallica fans. The days of Hit the Lights, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Sanitarium and Blackened are in the past. That Metallica died a long time ago. Just be glad they left us 4 of the all-time great metal albums.    People who like this brand of Metallica also listen to bands like Nickelback and 3 Doors Down. And that's fine. I am not criticizing those people. They like what they like.    At least be glad bands like Megadeth, Exodus, Testament and Slayer are still alive and trying to produce new music that still has a feel of that classic thrash metal sound. Metallica turned away from that almost 20 years ago, never to return. Stop waiting for the next Metallica album to sound like Metallica. It is folly.
B000244FDW|5.0|I have always loved this movie. What a joy to be able to see it on DVD. For all of you who love this movie I would recommend buying this you'll love it too
B00000G42T|5.0|This collection is magnificent.  George Michael is trully one of the greatest male vocalist and he gives us his best songs and your heart and soul will be moved.  A 2 CD set that consist of his most beautiful ballads (for the heart) and the other, (for the feet) a collection of songs to boogie down to.  I especially enjoy the ballads as it's a great set of songs to set the mood for a romantic night with someone special or even for some time alone.  I recommend this set along with the video collection.
B001675YQ6|4.0|Love and Other Disasters is a film that very few people even know about.  I happened to catch it, maybe 4 years ago as part of the Toronto International Film Fesival, when it was one of the movies showing that year.  I saw it with two friends and we all enjoyed it very much!  It's light...it's funny...it's cute...a great date movie...and has something for all adults, gay and straight alike (as it has a slight gay element) who like a good romantic comedy.   After we saw it.... we never heard another thing about it.  It never apparently found a distributor, and never was shown in theaters, to my knowledge.  About three years later...it appeared on DVD.  I have owned a copy since it came out on DVD and we had one of our \\"Movie nights\\" at our home with 8 or 9 friends over, and everyone enjoyed it a lot!      What amazes me in the movie business is all of the total garbage movies that get made and shown in theaters every week..... bad, awful, poorly made and poorly acted films that should never even be produced.... and then there are movies like \\"Love and Other Disaster\\" that are well-made, with good acting, and they never see the light of day.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I only rated this above one star because of the original story line.  The villain's character strains the bounds of credulity.  Sadly, this could have been quite suspenseful were it not for the constant repetitions of the same digressions.  Like Brown's other novels, this could have been a thriller that would keep you on the edge of your chair.  To me the book was at least 50+ pages too long due to the repetitions which I guess were there to drive home a certain philosophical/theological point of view.  Where were the editors on that one?  The locales were believable and exist in real life, according to Brown.  He didn't discuss the facts v. fiction items like he has in past books though.  Finally, the ending was anti-climactic and just sort of drizzled off.  I haven't gone into many details because I don't want to spoil it for others. I suggest you take the time to read the customer reviews before reading this book.  I read the Kindle version.  The formatting on it was okay.
B00192IV0O|3.0|I never bought a Black Eyed Peas CD before. I really like the song \\"I GOTTA FEELING\\" Well I should have listened to the CD on line before I bought it. That is basically the only song I like maybe a couple of others.
0385504225|5.0|Hard to follow up with a book so hyped and controversial like the Da Vinci Code. Many unfair reviews from people that haven't even read the book and just hate Dan Brown for what he writes. Whatever. This book was well written and entertaining. Did what it was supposed to do. Carry you away from reality for a while without being bored and annoyed. And some nice history lessons in there as well, as in all of his books. If you can't enjoy it, it's your own fault.
B001FBSMF8|1.0|I saw this disc in a store, and figured I'd buy it based on Cornell's past work.  Wow, what a mistake!  I could only get through the first three tracks.      There was a time when Mr. Cornell could write and perform a good pop/rock hook with some ballsey vocals.  Those days may be over.  This album is just another example of today's quasi-R&B dominated by studio tricks and electronics.      I'm guessing the depiction of Cornell smashing a guitar on the cover represents his  disavowment of rock 'n' roll.      One good thing about the disc is that it works well as an ice scraper for my car.
0307269981|3.0|I had read the Girl with the Dragon Tatoo so was not surprised by the flat, uninteresting sex throughout the book.  The author seems to just drop cold sex scenes into the narrative as if that would make the characters more interesting.  It doesn't.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|This music/ performance touches your heart and soul. This DVD is some extremely fine amazing piece of art.  Musicians like Joe Bonamassa don`t grow on trees. Joe Bonamassa is an artist of a caliber one only finds very few times throughout music history.   What can i say if you love good music go and buy this DVD. I have played guitar through almost half a century and have collected all kinds of music through these years and i can promise you it won`t get better than this. I would pay 100 times the price to get this DVD if that was necessary to get it. So buy it and spread the \\"virus\\".
B0000004WM|5.0|What makes this album good? What kind of styles she does? Since 1987, Sam decides to move from her rock roots to more of US Urban music by working with Full Force, Cheryil Pepsi Riley and Cilives and Cole and X Grilfriend. Now this album is good. Now Sam is very ecletic with her styles, like on this album, the first half were Freestyle and Hip Hop which was productions by Full Force and last 2 were rock styles except for what you see is what you get which sounds more pop. However, sam continues to go what she does best is sexual teases with her moans and sexual lyrics like Hurt Me! Hurt Me! But The Pants Stays on, More More More/Love To Love you Baby, the title track and Saving It Up, which she goes overboard with her moans. Nevertheless, this isn't a bad album but its worth listening to. If you like this album, try Kylie Minogue's lets get to it and martika's kitchen

B00004S8X5|5.0|In 1987, we saw the birth of Pop Princess Kylie Minogue with the first his single I Should Be So Lucky with her girl next door image and a couple of months later, she released her debut Kylie. Most of it foucses on Freestyle and bubble gum pop. Im gonna break it down and rate the songs:    I Should Be So Lucky: One of her signiture songs and most popular songs from her debut with her cutesy lyrics. 10/10    Locomotion: her biggest charting US single until 2001's Can't Get You OUt Of My Head and I prefer the 7\\" mix.9/10    Je Ne Sai: french for I Don't Why, good song. 9/10    It's No Secret: one of her less popular songs but in my opinion I really love this song regardless. 9/10    Got To Be Certain: very cute song and catchy upbeat and too silly with the handclaps. 10/10    Turn It Into Love: a Rick Astley type of song which is a Freestyle  hit song in 1989. 10/10    I Miss You: too bubblegum for me. 8/10    I'll Still Be Loving You: a mid tempo song which was the B Side to the 1987 version of Locomotion. 8/10    Look My Way: this song samples Rock Steady by the Whispers, ironically she uses the sample on the 50+1 as the intro of the song. 10/10    Love at First Sight (1988): not to be confused with her 2002 hit single. 9/10
B00004RJ71|5.0|I won't bore anybody with yet another review about how \\"Blood In, Blood Out\\" was another great epic Chicano movie... While I did see some disturbing parallels to \\"American Me\\" (Well, Montana can beat up Santana...), I tried focusing on the differences.  Montana bodyguard Gato was portrayed by Jimmy Santiago Baca, who was asked by Taylor Hackford to co-write the screenplay. Baca is an established poet who had himself spent some time in prison. I urge you to look up some of his work right here on Amazon; maybe after reading some of his raw, angry poetry can one develop a greater appreciation for \\"Blood In...\\" and its (what is commonly conceived as) hokey dialogue.<br />  Incidentally, parallels notwithstanding, \\"Blood In...\\" is NOT a remake of \\"American Me\\" and has more than enough of its own merit. \\"American Me's\\" vision and message were bleak, while \\"Blood In...\\" at least offered hope in a time of gangs and drugs.

0375757813|5.0|It's true that Fanny Price, the heroine, is different than most of the main characters of Jane Austen's books.  She is timid, not energetic, not witty, and fearful for the first few chapters.  Elizabeth Bennett she is not.  The story, though, is more about how others discover and come to appreciate her many good qualities: loyalty, intelligence, gentleness, excellent listening skills, and capable of feeling sympathy for almost anyone.  Although many people think she doesn't notice what goes on at Mansfield Park - which include scandalous flirtations, lack of respect for authority, and a particularily nasty aunt who berates Fanny into submission - Fanny sees all.  This is especially important when her dear cousin Edmund falls in love with the witty, vivacious Mary Crawford, whose morals are questionable at best and views of life is superficial and materialistic.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Fanny has to deal with Mary's wealthy brother Henry, who switches from toying with Fanny's cousins' affections to declaring passionate love to Fanny herself.  Fanny's big problem - and one that frustrates most readers - is that she is almost never in the position of speaking her own mind, being a young unmarried woman who originally comes from a poor family.  It's not so much about Fanny finding her voice as it is about others learning that to listen to it.  This is most evident in Sir Thomas, her uncle, who is very much used to do things his own way, and with whom Fanny is not in a position to share, to warn him, about the troubling Crawfords.<br /><br />This is Austen's most conservative book, so I understand why it may not be her most popular.  But for readers looking for a challenge, who don't mind a sublte protaganist, and who can be very patient, I highly reccommend this title.  It was the second Austen book I've ever read and is now one of my absolute favorite books of all time.  I'll leave with one last word - for anyone who's ever spent a Saturday night alone, wishing to have friends who understood them, this is for you.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|Fans of \\"classic\\" Bond movies will probably not be pleased. If you didn't like Casino Royale, this Bond is not for you. Since I didn't like \\"classic\\" Bond movies, Casino Royale was a breath of fresh air. In Quantum of Solace, I was just lucky to catch my breath through all the action.  Having given up the idea of having Bond win the day with fake, high-tech gadgets, this new take on Bond instead has Bond relying on his gun, fists, intelligence, and pure determination. And he looks like it. This move towards realism is one of the things I love about the Daniel Craig Bond movies.  Also gone are the outlandish \\"save the world\\" plots. I say \\"HURRAY\\" but this is one of the biggest complaints many have about this movie. Like my title implies, this movie is more a chapter than a book. This movie script was written for a more \\"mature\\" audience (I'm not talking about age). The audience must accept the idea that in the real world, good and bad become ambiguous, evil doesn't always (or even usually) consist of trying to destroy or take-over the world in one big move, and their is no magic number to call to get the number of the sinister head master of it all.  The bad guys in this movie are very patient, with a complex organization and a long-term plan. Bond must follow the leads that he has, and they don't take him straight to top. Some leads can't even be followed because they are sheltered by a credible government structure.  This leaves Bond desperately trying to chase down the one solid lead to Quantum that he can--Green. Bond is tormented by his personal demons, doubted by his government, and quickly finds himself alone, except for Camille, who wants Green as well, but for a different reason.  The leading lady is another source of enjoyment for me, but another disappointment to \\"classic Bond\\" fans. She also relies on real-world weapons and strategies, including both sex appeal and sex. She gets dirty (actual dirt here, not a euphemism) like no Bond girl has before. Thisleading lady is not arm candy, though she knows how to play that role when it suits her. I got the feeling that Bond respects her, a feeling not present in any of the \\"classic Bonds.\\" I don't know whether it is her toughness, Bond's respect, or the fact that she doesn't sleep with Bond that turns some people off. Personally, these are the reasons that I love her.  Though Camille and Bond have separate missions, they are both seeking revenge, which creates a compelling bond between them, even though it doesn't lead to love. Bond's loyalty to M and his country (though maybe not their orders) also provides emotional drive to the story.  I sincerely hope the director and Daniel Craig both stay on to continue making Bond movies.
B002CAWNEM|3.0|Unfortunately, the movie hit a damaged spot and we had to advance it, but as disappointed as we were, knew that it was not quite 'new' and thankfully we got to view the rest of it and the movie itself was good.  It taught me that it might work for some but we should just bite the bullet & choose new when purchasing.
B002I9Z89Y|5.0|Friends - the release of this wonderful collection has given rise to a serious blu-ray hardware compatibility issue.  The culprit is the addition of internet-based features on the latest generation of discs, including  BD-live and Mobile blu-ray.   Older generation blu-ray players, such as my Panasonic DMP-BD10A (purchased in early 2007 for a lot of $$$$) are not compatible with at least some BD-live blu-ray discs, including these Vol.2 TOS discs.  You will be able to see the root menu and access special features, but the episodes will not play.  Even after installing the latest firmware upgrade (now > 1 year old on Panasonic's website), I still had no luck.   The Panasonic tech support folks have been terrific, but acknowledge that these types of compatibility difficulties are inevitable with disc technology moving forward so quickly.  Older generation blu-ray player owners - you are officially on alert that you may have to consider upgrading your machines to address these new internet technologies.  By the way, the TOS volume 1 blu-ray discs play fine in the old generation players, but they did not get burned with these new internet features.  The good news is that the latest players don't cost what they did in 2007....
B001GCUER0|5.0|A friend of mine said he saw an episode of Mad Men and thought it was too slow.   I couldn't believe it.     Too slow?    Well, if you want people getting their heads blown off, or cars exploding,  yes, this series is not for you.    But if you want to see a period piece of the early sixties with some fantastic writing and characters with some depth, this show is for you.   And if you don't think Joan is worth the price of admission, you're hopeless (Playboy has to get her for Christmas).[[ASIN:B001GCUER0 Mad Men: Season 2]]
B001GCUO16|5.0|Dare I say, better than the original 3 movies of X-Men?  At least for me it is as good, if not more interesting.  The only thing I felt was that some of the \\"Effects\\" were a little cheaply done by today's standards.  Such as his claws once he gets them replaced with adamantium.  They were to shiny and to make it more realistic, they could've had more reflection in them.  They were too perfect.<br /><br />The story was very good.  Telling the origins of how he grew up as a mutant and well I won't spoil much, but how him and Beast were both involved in each other's lives.  Very cool.  So in reality, we saw the origins of both Beast and Wolverine.  Sooo coool.  There are even appearances of characters that are in the original X-men.<br /><br />This movie delivers full on action.  I recommend this movie to be part of any super hero library.<br /><br />The quality of the Blue Ray is just AMAZING!!  Every frame is stunningly presented and the sound was fantastic as well.  Great quality, great movie.
0307454541|5.0|The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a fairly deceptive novel.  When I first began reading it, I didn't know if I'd be able to continue.  After a mysterious setup which I figured would show up later as one of the central mysteries in the book, the novel dropped into drudgery.  This slow battle through a basic setup, which had me struggling to continue, belied the depth and pacing of this fantastic \\"locked room mystery.\\"<br /><br />As the story continued, paving the way for a handful plots involving a reporter, an aging businessman and a mysterious female private investigator, I found myself turning page after page, trying to piece together exactly what happened.  Ostensibly, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is about the mystery of a missing woman named Harriet.  Her uncle, now in his 80s and presumably close to death, has driven himself to the edge of sanity, obsessively pouring through the police accounts of the fateful night.  You see, Harriet seemingly vanished into thin air.  Her body was never found, either alive or dead, there's no real motive for her disappearance and it's presumed by both her uncle, Henrik Vandar, and a police investigator close to the case, that she was murdered.  Further complicating the mystery is the fact that every year, on Henrik's birthday, someone taunts him by sending him a pressed flower, in the same tradition that Harriet did prior to her disappearance.<br /><br />This drives Henrik to hire a disgraced reporter named Blomkvist.  Blomkvist agrees to live at Henrik's estate to do some digging, putting a fresh pair of eyes on the mystery, under the guise of writing an autobiography on Henrik. But this is only the first 100 or so pages.  As the story drives further toward its conclusion, it twists and becomes something more.  While the ultimate reveal of the \\"whodunit\\" probably isn't too terribly surprising, the scale and the strength of Larsson's writing helps the material rise up to terrific heights.  There's more to the story than the central mystery: What was once a story about a vanished girl becomes more focused on bigger issues like murder and sexual violence, but also invokes a compelling examination of society, specifically focusing on Sweden.<br /><br />Author Stieg Larsson died before his manuscript could be published.  When he was alive, he was a political activist and spent a large portion of his time exposing Swedish extreme right, racist and pro-Nazi organizations.  It's obvious that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo reflects his thoughts and intent. Consider the fact that the Swedish title of the book is M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor, which roughly translates to \\"men who hate women.\\"  Then, consider that each section of the book begins with a statistic: \\"Eighteen percent of the woman in Sweden have at one time been threatened by a man,\\" or \\"Forty-six percent of the women in Sweden have been subjected to violence by a man.\\"  As each part of the book goes by, the threat in these statistic escalates until its final conclusion.  In this way, a book of fiction, deliciously deep and interesting as a thriller and a whodunit, also has moral and societal implications.  In some ways, this book (and presumably the Millennium trilogy as a whole) is a perfect legacy for Larsson's beliefs and his actions.stery: What was once a story about a vanished girl becomes more focused on bigger issues like murder and sexual violence, but also invokes a compelling examination of society, specifically focusing on Sweden.

1416583408|5.0|This is a fascinating book, full of terrific details and interesting research about dogs. So many of the specific elements that she describes still stick in my head. There's great material in here, for instance, about dog's noses and how they smell, and how much they encounter the world through scent and odor. It's not simply that Horowitz tells us that dogs have a powerful sense of smell; it's that she goes well beyond that to help us think about how different their sense of time must be, for instance, since they are smelling old smells along with new ones at the same time. That's just one example of many. The book is chock full of the latest research about dogs, but told in a winning and delightful manner.    That's worth stressing: the writing in this book is great. It's colorful and idiosyncratic. Sometimes the syntax of a sentence is intriguing all on its own. The book is fun to read, in part, just because Horowitz writes so darn well. And, I should add, with a fair bit of whimsy and playfulness. She is a talent as a writer, as well as a scientist. And she makes the science accessible, interesting, and sometimes laugh-worthy.     But the book is also wonderful because it's so full of Horowitz's own enthusiasm for how great dogs are. She's a scientist, but she's hardly clinical. Her excitement about dogs comes pouring out in the small praise-of-dog moments that abound in the book. I feel like I finished the book not only knowing more about dogs (and impressed by all the things that Horowitz knows), but wanting to spend more time with dogs, looking at other people's dogs on the street, and thinking about when we might be able to get a dog of our own again. Her interest in the dog-human relationship -- which is so much the focus in the last chunk of the book -- spills over with her joy in it, and it's an infectious joy.    I can't recommend this book highly enough. I plan to give it as a gift this year to all my dog-owning and dog-loving friends!

006016848X|3.0|This book had some great insights and advice. And I read a lot of examples of behaviors or arguments that my partner and I have all the time, for some reason I assumed that these behaviors and arguments were there because there was something wrong with one of us or our relationship. It was very reassuring for me to see that these things are common, normal, and maybe even preventable to some degree. However, this book was also such a chore to read that one might almost suspect the author didn't pass freshman English. Metaphors can be helpful in illustrating a point, or apparently, for beating a point into the ground, as Mr. Gray did at least twice a page. Also the sweeping generalities and stereotypes do get a bit out of hand, and both sexes may at times feel a bit slighted.  If you read this book, and it may be worth it to do so, try not to get caught up in the author's (quite adamant) logic. Not everything will apply to you or your relationship. Try to think of it as more of a reference book, something to keep in mind, but certainly not to be thought of as gospel. The basic point of this book is that we need to understand ourselves and our partners more in order to have a better relatioship. No argument here.

I think this book has done a great job of putting these ideas into the minds of many. There is a lot of excellent information on this subject. For example, just about anything from Ester & Jerry Hicks or [[ASIN:9562913759 Feeling Is The Secret]] by Neville. I also like a short but sweet book by Michael Losier [[ASIN:0446199745 Law of Attraction: The Science of Attracting More of What You Want and Less of What You Don't]].

I recommend viewing it in subtitles because they speak so much of the time in such low tones I found myself watching it over and over trying to piece it together.

B001AQR39O|3.0|The only thing that kept me from giving the second season 4 stars was the writing for the supporting cast, namely Charlie and Marcy. For me, it felt like there was 2 shows...Hank's storyline, which I thought was excellent; and then the Charlie/Marcy show. I'm buying the DVD for the former, could do without the second.      I'm still totally sold on the series namely due to Duchovny. I thought the character development of Hank over the season was excellent (favorite episode was \\"In Utero\\"), and am anticipating what season 3 will be like Hank going back to school and taking care of Becca full-time. These are the two that have sold me on the series. I think their scenes together are stellar, and Hank remains flawed but likeable despite his poor choices. I even enjoyed rascal Lew Ashby and the potential for that character.     But where it fell apart for me was Charlie and Marcy. While it's downright criminal that Dani/Mia got away with \\"her book\\", I thought Charlie was a total idiot. He deserved to get canned from his job and his life just went down the hole after that. Marcy's storyline was just kind of sad, but I'm hopeful for her recovery in the next season. I hope the writers can get these two back on track, even if apart, watching the trainwreck of their lives is not funny, but more pitiful and sad. They made Hank look like he had his life together, which is saying a lot!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Welcome to Panem, the former United States, that is now divided into twelve districts that are run from the Capitol which is located in what used to be the Rocky Mountains.  The twelve districts once got together and tried to bring down the Capitol.  They lost and as punishment, each district is made to send one girl and one boy between the ages of 12 and 18 to participate in The Hunger Games each year.  Once there, the children have to fight each other for survival because there can only be one winner.  While the games are going on, it is a requirement that people everywhere watch and it is televised around the clock.      Wow, what a ride!  I really enjoyed this book.  While there are similar books out there, this one was different enough to stand on it's own and be considered original.  At least I think so.  The author did a great job with the characters, specifically the character of Katniss.  She was so strong and smart, especially to just be a teenager.  My one complaint with the book is that it ended where it did!  Now, I have to get my hands on the next one and soon.  Maybe as soon as I'm finished typing this review...anyway, if you enjoyed this one, I highly recommend reading The Long Walk by Stephen King.  It's a novella, so it's short, but it is an amazing story with a similar concept.
B0025KVLRY|5.0|It's great to hear the British version of The Fab Four's second album in stereo, although this isn't the first time these tracks have been issued as such (all these tracks already appeared in stereo on \\"The Capitol Albums Vol. 1\\"). Like the first album, half the tracks are their own compositions-one by George this time-while the others are cover versions of songs that influenced them early on. There were no singles from this album since \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" was their then-concurrent hit single although \\"All My Loving\\" is a very popular track.    For any rock fan, this is a great album to have even though it may not be quite as essential as many of their later albums would be. With this album you're listening to a band that's still growing. As George says at the end of the mini-documentary, wait until '64, '65 and '66.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|This is not a bad story. It still provided me plenty entertainment.  However, it can't compare to The Da Vinci Code or The Angels & Demons.  The previous two books blew my mind, from the beginning to the end.   I couldn't put them down and couldn't wait to see what happened.  For The Lost Symbol, there were some surprises and there were some cliches.  I actually guessed some of the big plot surprises before the answers were out.  I think Dan Brown can do better than that.   Maybe I love the previous two books too much. I think it would be really hard to  top those two, or even just be as good.
0316067598|5.0|Wow! What a story! What a warrior! I am proud to have Marcus Latrell protecting us and serving the USA. What a powerful, well written book. Engrossing, exciting and sad, all at the same time. If you have not read this book, do so now!
0143034901|2.0|I realize I'm in the very small minority of readers who didn't fall in love with this story.  I tried - I really did! - but couldn't get into the rhythm or the story and gave up after 150 pages.  The writing style was formal and a bit florid for my taste and the story didn't engage me - there just wasn't enough there to tantalize me into wanting to pick it back up, always a bad sign.<br /><br />It was slow going and I threw in the towel so I can only tell you about what I did read: the premise is intriguing...a young boy, raised by his antiquarian bookseller father, comes into possession of a mysterious book and its even more mysterious author.  As he becomes more involved into solving the disappearance of the book's author, he becomes enmeshed in a world of sinister secrets.<br /><br />Perhaps there was so much hype about this book that when I finally picked it up, my expectations were too high.

How our world works and how we fit into our world (and why) shows how easily we can develop mis-conceptions about ourself or others.

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Let me preface by saying I've read all of Dan Brown's books and found them entertaining.  I thought the writing and editing got progressively better in the order they were written with Da Vinci Code being an impeccable thriller.  Unfortunately it is my guess that Dan Brown's former success has made his editor reluctant to critisize his work.     All of Dan Brown's books are formulaic and this is no exception.  Similar plot lines and character sets from his former books give it a write-by-numbers feel.  That by itself is not a problem.  Unfortunately it is also really, really predictable.  I'll not spoil the book for you but lets just say there are no real surprises in there.      Additionally it seems that everything is said three times in this book.  His endlessly reminding us of facts presented earlier in the book borders on condescending.  This book could have easily been half as long.    Thirdly, if you loved Da Vinci Code because it was just grounded enough to be plausible as I did, then this book is sure to disappoint.  The technology and \\"science\\" presented in the book is actually in the realm of metaphysics and dated science fiction.  It pushes the book from gritty realistic thriller to fantasy and science fiction.  Don't get me wrong, I love a good science fiction book but it just doesn't work when you were expecting a nice historical puzzle wrapped in a grounded thriller.    Finally, the dialog is atrocious.  The antagonist's dialog is melodramatic to the point of being unbelievable and for reasons I've yet to pinpoint, Robert Langdon (the protagonist), has gotten dumber and more annoying - but he's swimming a lot so at least he is staying fit.  Dan Brown must also really hate college students because he portrays them as one-dimensional, dimwitted, and rude.  Maybe they are.  It's not my recollection but I haven't been in college for a while.    In short, this is not a book worth buying...
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I've always avoided using a flash on my digital cameras because the built-in flashes were so tiny that they were virtually useless and the shoe-mounted flashes were  heavy and bulky to pack around. I was always uncomfortable mounting them on my camera's hot shoe  because I felt as if they put a lot of strain on the shoe. I recently bought a Nikon D90 and wanted to take indoor photos of my grandkids. I looked around and found the Nikon SB-400. I was hesitant to buy it because it was spendy and I didn't know if I'd use it enough. I'm glad that I did and am finding that I now use a flash quite frequently.    This unit is small and streamlined and it doesn't feel as if it's going to rip the hot shoe off the camera. It has an amazing amount of power for such a small unit and battery life is excellent. It's extremely easy to use with the D90 - take it out of its pouch, mount it, and turn it on. The D90's TTL metering system does the rest. If you want to modify the output of the flash just use the D90's built-in flash exposure compensation adjustment.    I also purchased the Flip-it! 400 bounce card produced by Demb Flash Products. This small and compact bounce card is designed to work well with the SB-400. It mounts and can be removed easily with an elastic strap that has a  Velcro tab. It looks very small but it works great.
0307588335|5.0|Below is an email i wrote to the author about the book. I am so impressed by this book, i cant really describe it. The fact that he did respond makes me believe his story even more honestly.     \\"Hello Larry,     You and I have never met, and no, this is not an email like the one you sent to Kate Bohner, this is just an email thanking you for your book. The book was recommended to me by my brother, a junior at Bucknell University. He is management major and has a dream much like yours, to be on Wall Street. He read your book and was mesmerized and suggested I read it. I am in the housing business, i have a novice/intermediate knowledge of finance and do pretty well investing so he thought it was something I'd like to read. His excitement and interest doesn't quite do the book justice as far as I'm concerned. I've read good business books before, but this book set itself apart. The thing I appreciated most is the fact that you explain such complicated topics (SIVs, CDOs, etc) in such easy to understand terms. I don't normally gush over books or movies for that matter, but I really really loved this book and have been suggesting it to everyone I talk to about it. I thought, given the fact that you wrote it, I thought you'd just like to know that.\\"
0385504225|4.0|There are some really exciting and creative twists, turns, and puzzles in this novel, which is the basis for my 4-star rating. The codes and puzzles are fascinating and fun, chases and escapes put you on the page-turning edge of your seat, and there is one enormous twist that I really never saw coming. I had a very hard time putting this novel down. Brown is a master of the cliff-hanger.<br /><br />However,,,there were quite a few times when I read and read and read, and was still on the same page. Brown does love to lecture, and some of the book is dense and repetitive. (Well, his characters lecture. One even cheerfully launches into a twenty-page-long history, science and philosophy lecture -- with accompanying guided tour -- despite the fact that he is badly injured and desperately needs medical care.) Here is an author telling his readers, \\"I spent 50,000 research hours in libraries and archives worldwide and, by golly, you're gonna know it!\\" Burying actual plot and puzzles into these lectures makes it difficult to just skim them. So an unfortunate chunk of this novel can be a pretty wearying slog.<br /><br />Also, characterization is not Brown's strong point. Characters are mostly ciphers running around creating havoc or following clues in a National Treasure-type hunt. But that hunt is fast and furious, leaves characters and readers alike gasping, and is, despite all the metaphysical mumbo-jumbo, very, very entertaining. After all, we're not really reading Brown for sensitive character development. We're reading him for fun, puzzles and enigmas, a little esoteric history (although he provides a lot), and a runaway train scavenger hunt. All this Brown certainly delivers.<br /><br />There's not much payoff to all this racing around, but it's fun along the way. In fact, Brown packs in so much plot and energy that I was surprised at the end to realize the whole story took place over only about 12 hours. And the ending, while a letdown, was not unexpected. After all, Robert Langdon must say about twenty times, \\"There can't be any such thing!\\" Still, I wasn't disappointed. The Lost Symbol is imaginative and energetic, and there are lots of twists and surprises along the way. I really did enjoy it.

B0016BWACI|5.0|Loved watching this film repeatedly as a teen when it came out. The Blu did not disappoint in any way.<br /><br />The preservation came across in as good a light as could be with so many sets. The colors shined through beautifully in some of the exteriors and CGI landscapes. The garden sequences looked great, as did even some of the simpler things like the sand of the Mystics. The big test for me was the outlined exteriors where either Mystics or those walkers were set against the sky - it all looked good; the majority of the artifact and grain was gone. The sound was fine and really the only fault I saw right away was the credits vibrating with the film, otherwise the screenings have impressed everyone with the vibrancy and clarity all these years later.<br /><br />The supplements include the array from prior releases with some complicated new ones, including:<br />* Book of Thra Dark Crystal Collector. A slide show intro gives the viewer instructions on how to use your four color buttons to collect items as they highlight on the screen (during the film). As you collect them you can open a book that gives historical info/trivia on the item you select (history of the castle, crystal info, etc.) You can open this book and read the material while the film is running so about half of the screen can be taken up while both collecting and reading; all pop-up options are disabled though so you have to exit all of this to re-access everything else.<br />* Trivia Game. This was actually fun if you have seen the film recently or are a hardcore buff on the information, otherwise most everyone was failing it that tried while re-watching for the first time in a bit. The game art takes up the four corners of the screen with a score tally and question sheets that have multiple guess answers selectable with the four color buttons. Same issue with pop-up capability as you have to close the game and have your player re-start from prior spot in the film (mine took about 30 secs to reboot back into the film). Would be fun for one of those rainy days where you don't want to watch the film but it would will still be playing in the background (sounds, music).<br />* PiP Storyboard Track. Outside of the textual intro about the storyboard process/trivia, the PiP was disappointing. Mainly because they admit the majority of the boards no longer exist so it was done from memory, plus the box takes up a significant part of the screen during the film, so it did not entertain me that much.<br />* Intro by Screenwriter - I could not find this anywhere so can't fill you in.<br /><br />The menus play nicely with the majority of options being presented on the same screen - clear pics and nice music score on them also. Overall, a great product on a wonderful film. Enjoy.Would be fun for one of those rainy days where you don't want to watch the film but it would will still be playing in the background (sounds, music).  * PiP Storyboard Track.

B001GCUO16|4.0|We got this movie even with all the mixed reviews because word of mouth among our real life friends said it was a good movie.  While it has its faults, there is a lot to love about the movie.    The good.  The main characters all do an excellent job.  Especially Jackman since he real life voice and demeanor do not even come close to Logan.  Sabertooth also does a great job in his acting for the script he was given.  You get a real sense that even though he is at odds with his brother, he cares about him more than anything else.... after all according to the movie plot, they have been together for about 150 years.    They do a good job explaining how he got the metal in him and the claws as well as his memory loss even though I personally did not like that part of it.    The graphics and effects were great too.  On blu ray especially it looked so good.    The bad.  The movie moved along way to fast.  You get a small glimpse of the brothers going through wars and stuff up till the present day but largely ignore that back story.  Then they join a special group of others like them and again we get fast forward through their time together and a very brief introduction to the other specials.  He leaves during what appears to be his first mission and somehow everyone is upset and that breaks up the group even though he was new and never did anything for them at least as the movie shows.  He goes and tries to start a normal life and of course that can not happen.  Again this was all so rushed, it should have been its own movie and spent the time to develop these characters better and their relationships.    Also far too many characters die and for no reason it seems.  Now in the first Xmen I had an issue with the fact that they were so light on killing and they needed some low level mutants as fodder but this movie just wastes good established (from the comic books) characters.    Of course as many others pointed out this movie strays far from the comics but so do the Xmenmovies.  I can not really fault that here as they try to stay more in line with the other films than with the comics.  Personally I can accept this as an alternate version of the Xmen world and am ok with that.    Overall we still enjoyed the movie but were disappointed at how far short they fell with what they could have done.  I imagine that in 10 years or so somebody will pick up Xmen again and perhaps do the series right.  Good movie but not great.
0385504225|3.0|I read \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" early this year and couldn't wait to read \\"The Lost Symbol\\". The first two books in the Robert Langdon series were brilliant. \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" was a masterpiece.<br /><br />However, when I finally got my hands on a copy of \\"The Lost Symbol\\", I was a little disappointed. It was a huge step down from \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". There weren't a lot of exciting, thrilling parts in the book. It seems as if Dan Brown was, more or less, \\"playing it safe\\" with this novel.<br /><br />All in all, it's a good read. Not great, but good. I try not to be too disappointed, because it would have been hard for anyone to write a sequal to \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and it be as good or better.

B001FB4W0C|5.0|I was counting down the days until Supernatural: The Complete Fourth Season would arrive at my house.  Then the day came, woohoo!  I had a couple friends that were waiting for me to get the new DVD collection as well.  We watched and loved it.  The battle between the newest group that joins the plot (Angels) vs. Demons was exciting.  I'm sooo glad that I bought this!!  The day that the season 4 came out, was the day that I received my copy from Amazon.  I love ordering from Amazon!  Thanks, and I hope that you enjoy Supernatural Season 4!  Season 5 is out now on Thursday nights on the CW.
B000063UR1|1.0|After seeing the recent movie \\"Moon,\\" I read that writer/director Duncan Jones (a.k.a. David Bowie's kid) mentioned this movie as one of the sci-fi movies that inspired the \\"retro\\" look of Moon. Since I loved Moon, I ordered this.     I knew it probably wouldn't be up to the standards of 2001, but thought it would be in the ballpark.     WRONG!    The effects are terrible. The lighting is terrible. All the models of spaceships look like models. The script is terrible, childish, amateurish. The \\"acting\\" is terrible. The Joan Baez songs are totally hokey. The warehouse in space looks like a warehouse. Most of the instrumentation in the space ship is made of off the shelf oscilloscopes and other electronic test equipment. One magical device is simply a commercial light bulb.    Kubrick's genius is even more apparent after seeing this. The effects of 2001 hold up even 40 years later, while this movie, made several years later by some of the same people, looks like a joke.
B00005JLKB|4.0|Great show really only one i buy the dvd's for but come on what is it with the changing prices 20 dollers one day 50 the next. LOL haven't been able to buy this one because every time i have money for it the price goes up. When i dont have money then it is cheap.
B002KLAL4W|5.0|I received this CD, along with Arctic Monkey's new CD, as a present. I've listened to the disc a few times and I really like it. The album remind me a bit of Vitology, so this has been a bit of a throwback for me.     The sound, the songs, the lyrics, are all great. It's funny that from all the 'great' and big Seattle bands during the grunge era (early 1990s), only this one survives (ironically, with Soundgarden's drummer). Think about it: Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Nirvana, etc. are all gone along with their other alt rock peers such as Smashing Pumpkins, Stone Temple Pilots, etc.     Pearl Jam has managed to produce one quality album after another' this one won't disappoint. All the tracks a good in my opinion. I just love the album. I would go as far as saying that Pearl Jam is one of the best bands in the world and their longevity proves it. They're up there with U2, the Rolling Stones, and the Beattles.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|First off  do not listen to these albums with headphones on. I have good Grado headphones  but when I did I was so disapointed in the sound. the sound was muffled. Did I make the wrong purchase I thought. The next day I hooked my little ipod to a mono Model One radio by Tivoli Audio. Clear, warm sounds, great drums, beautiful vocals. My ears are sooo happy. The extras make the records like the fun experience we had when we first bought the vinyls: record album made out of paper and sleeves with the originals artwork ( why can't more companies do this. please get away from the cursed jewel boxes!), and poster inserts, and those silly liner notes. This has been an excellent purchase. I always wanted the beatle collection. Who knew it would be in mono!
B002EWD08Q|3.0|It's hard for me to say this, but this album is a disappointment. I loved the Arctic Monkeys since \\"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not\\", but this album hit me like a ton of bricks.     The songs, if taken in isolation, are good and remind me a bit of The Doors; the sound is a bit seventyish. However, taken all together, the album sounds forced as if they're trying to one-up themselves or prove to the world that they are mature and that they are deeper than thou. The sad thing is that this band is talented and shouldn't have work this hard.     From the first track, \\"My Propeller\\" to the last track, \\"The Jeweller's Hand\\", the album plays like an exhausting, endless dirge that seems as if it was dedicated to some chthonic god. I had to listen to it in chunks. Seriously, I'd recommend shuffling the songs in your iPod or MP3 player with other songs just to break up the downer that this album is.    I've noticed that many bands, go through these phases where they start out peppy, but to prove they are serious, they go darker and deeper and more focused; they consider their earlier efforts too broad and simple for them. I get it! We get it! Enough already.     I get the impression that this band just isn't comfortable in their skin (yet!). They ought to take a look at U2 and Pearl Jam and see why these guys are still cool after nearly 30 and 20 years respectively.     Even the album cover is awful: they look like drug addicts. I mean, if I were putting out a new album, I'd fix myself up a little. A hair cut? Some clean clothes?     Just like a piece of art, a meal, or an edifice, albums need to make sense. An album is a work of art AND at the same time a commoditized product that will be consumed by the masses. As I said above, the songs by themselves are good, but in this dire collection, they don't work. I'm giving it three stars because songs such as \\"Crying Lightning\\", \\"Dangerous Animals\\", and \\"The Jeweller's Hand\\".    I hope their next album diverges fromthis mess.     Sorry guys, not good enough.
031606792X|1.0|My first reaction was that Breaking Dawn deserved negative 100 stars.  But then I thought, isn't that arbitrary? Why stop there?  Why not go down to negative a thousand? Indeed, why not?  So I came to decide that the book rated negative 1,000 stars.  But my thought process continued as such, whence I came to the ultimate reasoning.  There is no review low enough for this book.  It's infinitely bad.    Hope that helps!
B0009UC7QQ|4.0|How far are we from this kind of show? With reality TV taking over the airwaves, and government intrusion into our personal lives a persistent concern, I fear not very.<br /><br />The Truman Show gives us a chance to enjoy a startling good performance by Mr. Carrey, while at the same time providing a warning about the risks not only of creating and enjoying such \\"entertainment\\" but indeed of aspiring toward such a seemingly perfect existence as Seahaven. Utopia has a tendency to become much less perfect once you realize it is fake and the joke is on you.<br /><br />Other than the deplorable lack of a commentary (on this \\"Special Edition\\"), I only have one complaint. The high school flashbacks are awkward because the actors look too old. It would have been better to get teenagers, or at least actors in their twenties, for this sequence.

B000W07EKW|4.0|Matt Damon *is* Jason Bourne.<br /><br />I enjoyed these movies tremendously, so I'll just address why it's missing a star.<br /><br />First, in principle, the box set itself is essentially just a re-release of the existing single DVDs. The only thing you get is the nice case, plus a bonus DVD (the one in the big passport). This didn't bother me, since I never had the individual films. But for someone who already does, it's a big ask to pay for a shiny box and three featurettes.<br /><br />Second, and with regard to Bourne Identity, the disc itself doesn't exactly match what's on the back of the DVD case. Specifically, the Director's commentary is missing.<br /><br />FYI: less than a year after this box set came out, Universal re-released (again!) the same three movies, this time without the fancy box or bonus disc, as the \\"Bourne Trilogy.\\"
B00005JNS0|3.0|Before the firing squad takes their position, at least let me tell you what I liked about it, too. I loved the Route 66 scenes and the history lesson this film teaches about the dangerous by-products of consumerism and convenience. So we get somewhere ten minutes faster, big deal. But what do we lose in the process? The Interstate System opened up America, but in the process it closed the door to much Americana.<br /><br />As for Cars, it kick-started a renaissance in Route 66 \\"Mother Road\\" scholarship, or at the very least an interest in driving to see what's left. Speaking for myself, I have made a point to check out US 40 in Amarillo (72-ounce steak at the Big Texan, anyone?), and have high hopes of getting to Oklahoma and Arizona in the near future. Indeed, John Lasseter's inspiration for the film was his own family's cross-country road trip in 2000.<br /><br />Being equally honest, I didn't care for the racing scenes, even though they were visually impressive. Every Disney film has its villain, but Chuck Hicks was unnecessarily mean with no redeeming qualities. At least Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), despite starting his relationship with Lightning in an adversarial manner, ultimately transforms into a father-son mentor.<br /><br />There's also lots of crashing and aggression on the track, which certainly contributes to the rookie's unhealthy win-at-any-cost mentality, at least until he is forced to spend some down time in Radiator Springs, a la Doc Hollywood. (Did the writers of that film receive any credit for the blatant lift?)<br /><br />And while I like Mater's heart, I am unhappy that he has been fashioned into such a White Trash caricature. He's dumb and dirty and he talks funny. In my opinion, it's not enough to portray him as the tow truck equivalent of the \\"whore with a heart of gold.\\" Overall, I was disappointed at the many simple stereotypes. Even Guido, though cute, is painted as a non-English speaking immigrant, fit only to change tires.<br /><br />This film has its moments. I just don't think the people who embrace the Route 66 legacy are also going to cheer the NASCAR racing, and vice versa. Great music, though.<br /><br />See also:<br />[[ASIN:0312281617 Route 66: The Mother Road 75th Anniversary Edition]]<br />(by Sheriff!)nk the people who embrace the Route 66 legacy are also going to cheer the NASCAR racing, and vice versa.

B001VPJYZK|3.0|Although Desperate Housewives is still a lot of fun, Season 5 is a bit disappointing compared to the previous seasons. It has become some kind of classy soap opera. Still beautifully filmed, with great actors and entertaining. Yet, there is no real mystery in this one that want you to watch the next episode right away. Some very good scenes, yet no climax such as the tornado in Season 4. Great for die-hard fans though.

0385504225|3.0|Compared to Dan Brown's earlier novels, I would place this dead last.  The most interesting sections of the book developed the freemason influence on the formation of America. However, Nicholas Cage does a better job in the National Treasure series, especially with Diane Kruger, where there is a real connection.  A basic underlying theme of the novel was that no character, not even Mal'akh, was fully developed.  One wonders if Robert is a eunuch as well as Mal'akh in that he never seems to have an emotional or sensual connection to any of his damsels in distress.  Katherine seems to have feelings for Robert but they are never fully explored or explained.  It seems that truly intelligent Dan Brown characters are devoid of sexual attraction.  Walter (?) Bellamy appears to be an important figure who trails off into nothingness.  Peter's physical introduction in the second half of the book is pure mythology (1) he shows little if any feeling for his son after rediscovering him, and (2) impractical guiding of Robert to additional clues after having just lost his right hand (a physical if not emotional incapability.)  A truly interesting character is Inouc Sato, who, for much of the book I thought was going to end up being aligned with Mal'akh.  If it had occupied any more of my time I would have been disappointed, but considering that Borders sold them for 40% list price, it's not worth asking the author or publisher for a refund.
B0018BB21G|4.0|I'm finally getting around to replacing all my Moody Blues record albums with CDs.

Their music takes me back to another place and time, and it holds up well.

B0029LHW4A|5.0|Shaka Rock is an all around fun album to listen to. It's got a lot of catchy tunes that you'll want to just keep playing over and over again. While I feel this CD lacks the classic rock roots that Get Born and even Shine On contained, that in no way makes this CD a bad investment.    I also noticed about Shaka Rock that it's lacking in the slow tunes. Get Born's \\"Look What You've Done,\\" \\"Move On,\\" \\"Radio Song,\\" \\"Come Around Again,\\" and \\"Timothy\\" as well as Shine On's \\"Kings Horses,\\" \\"Shine On,\\" \\"Shiny Magazine,\\" and \\"Eleanor\\" showed off their ability to turn down the volume when needed, and a few of those songs are incredible soft, slow songs. However, the closest thing to any of those for JET on Shaka Rock is the very last song, \\"She Holds A Grudge.\\" And while I think this is an incredible song, especially to end the album on, I wish there'd have been a little more slow songs that we could just relax to.    But don't take this review the wrong way. Fans of JET on Get Born and Shine On will still be very pleased with the turn out here. Just don't expect the EXACT same thing... just a variation on the same theme I guess.    So, if you're looking for an album FULL of catchy, fast-paced, and just plain cool tunes, Shaka Rock is for you. This CD will add nicely to your collection, it's got great JET sound and a lot of music you'll want to hear again and again.    Plus, it's got a burning van on the front!
B000NVL9KG|5.0|I don't have to worry about re-master anything, as I burned this off my scratchy and poppy vinyl to CD. It's no audiophile production, but with my worn out ears, it doesn't make much difference.<br /><br />I bought this when it came out. I was a single GI living in the barracks at Torrejon AB in Spain. I was getting into all kinds of music, and spent most of my money on stereo equipment and albums.<br /><br />Side one is hands-down, the best track(s). I love Tarkus and can play it over and over again. For progressive rock, they nailed it better here than most other bands of that ilk, or for that matter, themselves. I never liked any of their other albums as well, and compare them to side 2, which is okay, more in a pop vein, but nothing to write home about. Though I was a faithful fan and purchased most of their other albums, I ended up being a tad disappointed. If I hear Karn Evil 9 one more time I'm going to scream. Or, that out-of-tune Moog improv at the end of Lucky Man. However, this has them all beat for sheer virtuosity.<br /><br />From Emerson's keys, to Lakes nasal voice and bass riffs, to Palmers energetic and intricate drumming, this has it all. Highly recommended.
B000003TAW|5.0|This is obviously Weezer's first album, containing the hits Buddy Holly, Undone (the Sweater Song), My Name Is Jonas, Say It Ain't So, In The Garage...    Oh wait, I'm listing all of them... well, they're all hits to me!    This CD is an excellent way to get started on Weezer. See where they came from, what they sounded like when the began, and then follow their progression as they continued. Their sound never REALLY changed, it just got more refined. This CD is a great mix of that classic garage-punk (grunge) sound without going too heavy. Cuomo sounds great as he belts out his emotions through the microphone, and the music behind every song fits so well, you'll be thinking to yourself, \\"Wow! What took me so long to buy this CD?!\\"    So, in case you haven't gathered by now, I would definitely suggest buying this CD. It's that grunge sound without getting overly heavy or just outright stupid, which means ten tracks of great music.

B001HDO4Z6|5.0|Prospekt's March, the EP released shortly after Viva La Vida, is an excellent addition to the list of music off of Coldplay's fourth album. Life In Technicolor II, Postcards From Far Away, Glass of Water, Rainy Day, Prospekt's March, and Now My Feet Won't Touch The Ground are the six new songs on this CD. I personally LOVE LiTii (Life in Technicolor ii) and Glass of Water for the faster songs. My favorite slow song is Now My Feet Won't Touch The Ground, although Prospekt's March does come pretty close. Lost+ and Lovers In Japan (Osaka Sun Mix) are the two remixes from Viva La Vida. Lost+ contains a section of Jay-Z doing his thing in the middle of the song (which I personally don't care to listen to, but I suppose if you like it than more power to you...) and Lovers In Japan is nothing more than a ever-so-slightly sped up version of the original with a few extra vocals in the chorus parts.<br /><br />Final opinion: It's not meant to stand on it's own with only eight tracks, and only five or six of them only really being new... but this CD is an excellent addition to Viva La Vida. It rounds it out nicely with some incredible tracks, which we've come to expect from Coldplay. If anything, this CD makes me anticipate even more what they'll come out with next.

0061537969|1.0|Many others have commented on the qualities that prevent this book from being a great piece of literature: its sappiness, its one-dimensional characters, its 8th grade reading level and its obvious intention to be transformed into a sappy screenplay. However, what I really hated was the plot device where a sexually ravenous 15-year old girl tries to seduce Denny and then accuses him of statutory rape.    We live in a culture where the reality is that children and women are raped and sexually abused at epidemic rates. Why perpetuate the mostly-myth of the false rape accusation in this book? It felt like some kind of gross male fantasy or vendetta on the authors part to include the Annika storyline.    After 2 pages, I realized this book wasn't going to do it for me, but might be good to pass on to my 14-year-old foster son, who loves dogs and race cars. Unfortunately, I won't be passing it on because his sister was sexually abused by a neighbor, and has gone through hell trying to prove this in court.    This book is a big fail. The author should have toned down the sexual aspects of the plot and written it as young adult novel. No educated adult will find this book very interesting.
0307389839|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this memoir. Although I am not a runner, I can understand why so mant people find running exhilerating - the so called runners high - when the endorphins dance in the mind. I can appreciate that a person is not really concentrating on their thoughts - they just let them flow like a dream. Haruki Murakami hinted at this. What I really appreciated was when Haruki Murakami talked about his writing - the fact that he wakes up early in the morning and spends four hours writing before he does anything else. I try to emulate this - it is not easy. I do find the mornings the best time to write. Mr. Murakami did not dwell on his creativity aspect of his life, he was more in tune with his running in this memoir. I respect his drive to forever improve his time in running - to always do better. That strive for success is impressive and contagious - makes me think about my own path to success. This is a book for both Haruki Murakami fans [literature fans] and runners.[[ASIN:0679775439 The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle: A Novel]][[ASIN:037571894X A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel]][[ASIN:0679753796 Dance Dance Dance]]

B001AQTWF2|4.0|\\"Don't call it a comeback. I've been here for years,\\" declares Whitney Houston on her six studio CD, I Look to You. And in a sense, she's right. In the seven years since her prior release Just Whitney, Houston has never left the public's eye. Her 2002 interview with Diane Sawyer sent shock-waves throughout the tabloid media with the now infamous line \\"Let's get one thing straight. Crack is cheap. I make too much money to ever smoke crack.\\" Her reality show Being Bobby Brown debuted on Bravo in 2005 and showed Houston at odds with her then husband Bobby Brown. The two divorced in 2007 after years of alleged physical and verbal abuse on Brown's part. Whitney Houston, in 2009, told media sources she wanted to move to an island and retire, and who could blame her? Luckily for fans and casual listeners of the six-time Grammy award winning singer, she accepted an invitation from long-time friend Clive Davis to record a thoroughly enjoyable adult R&B CD in I Look to You.<br /><br />The old school flavored \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" opens the 11 track set with a 70s, soul vibe sure to leave a lasting first impression. Produced by Swizz Beatz and Alicia Keys, the song opens with a Issac Hays-like guitar riff that could've been from the movie Shaft. Houston, on the album's first vocal note, soars with a powerful reminder that she can still hold her own in the studio. On \\"A Song for You\\", a Leon Russell ballad, Houston revamps a song she's been covering since the early 90s into a disco number. Although she's no longer able to reach those stratosphere notes from her prime, Houston uses all she's got to deliver a gritty, respectable effort.<br /><br />A recurring theme throughout I Look to You is perseverance, and considering the personal set-backs Houston suffered over the past few years, the diva has a lot to sing about. She addresses the so-called \\"haters\\" throughout the album, particularly on the track \\"Nothin' But Love\\" where she confesses \\"Shout out to anyone who tried to hate on me / ... even the one's who tried to break me / Even the one's who tried to take me down.\\" On \\"For the Lovers\\", a song dedicated to, as Houston put it, \\"anyone who believes in love\\", the diva speak-sings \\"to all the haters in the place / I ain't singing to you.\\" The song, with its throbbing base, is practically a descendant of the \\"It's Not Right, But It's Ok\\" Thunderpuss Remix. The album's closer, the anthemic \\"Salute\\", penned by R. Kelly, addresses Houston's past relationships as she sings \\"I can do better / You say i'll never do better / Yeah right, whatever.\\"<br /><br />The ballads on I Look to You are the album's low point. With Houston's voice now a hoarse, aged semblance of her Bodyguard glory days, what may work and work well for her on dance and mid-tempo tracks, doesn't on ballads. Houston deserves to be applauded for not using any auto-tune device for the heart-felt, intimate tracks \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" and \\"I Look to You\\", but such a raw, stripped down format focuses too much attention on the flaws in Houston's struggling voice. She enlists the famed songwriter Diane Warren for \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\", which continues the recurring theme of self-empowerment on I Look to You. The song was given a performance on Oprah in August 2009 and was one of the first to be released to the public. The title track, one of five songs written or produced by R. Kelly on the album, boasts a slightly better vocal delivery than \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength.\\" Houston finds herself at her most sincere and emotionally vulnerable here. She sings:<br /><br />After all that I've been through<br />Who on earth can I turn to?<br />........................................<br />When all my strength is gone<br />In you I can be strong<br />I look to you.<br /><br />The slow jam \\"Worth It\\" takes cues from Whitney Houston's 1999 hit \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\". Filled with numerous sassy, one-liners, \\"Worth It\\" is sure to be a staple on quiet storm radio stations or for after-hour club play. For the second verse, Houston delivers the album's most clever lyrics. She quips:<br /><br />Some people feel it -- they let it show<br />Some people miss it -- they let it go<br />Some people doubt it -- Imma tell you now,<br />They don't know a thing about it<br />That's why they doubt it.<br /><br />The line \\"I know somebody's gonna make love to this song tonight,\\" is sure to get a roar out of a crowd if performed live.<br /><br />\\"Like I Never Left\\", the first track released to the public, is also the only track to feature another vocalist. Akon, the track's producer and feature singer, was contacted by Whitney Houston to write a song similar to \\"My Love is Your Love\\", her 1998 mid-tempo hit, and to give the song an \\"island\\" feel. \\"Like I Never Left\\", although pleasant, doesn't hold up to any of Houston's old hits (or Akon's for that matter), but is still a soothing addition to I Look to You. Akon's other produced track, \\"I Got You\\", does a better job of rivaling \\"My Love Is Your Love\\", as it sees Houston confidently taking a stand on the strength of love. She sings, righteously:<br /><br />When your love is strong<br />And it comes from the heart<br />Ain't no man strong enough<br />Ain't no time long enough<br />To tear it apart.<br /><br />My personal favorite, aside from \\"Million Dollar Bill\\", is \\"Call You Tonight\\". With its light lyrics, production, and subject matter, the song is a welcome departure from the more adult themes found throughout the album. Houston meets a potential lover or friend and promises to call him as soon as she gets home. On the song's climax, she sings, \\"So if you wanna know / Then stay by the phone / Stay by the phone.\\"<br /><br />Whitney Houston's six studio album serves as another soundtrack to a movie in which Houston plays the lead role. And no, we're not talking The Bodyguard or The Preacher's Wife, but the blockbuster that has been Whitney Houston's life over the past seven years.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have always been a big Sci-Fi and Fantasy fan.  In brief, Firefly/ Serenity is the best Sci-Fi that I have ever seen.  It is an extremely satisfying and well-rounded premise.  It is well written and very believable.  If you like Sci-Fi, Western, Drama and Comedy, or just a good story with great writing, I highly recommend you buy this series.  I guarentee that you won't be disappointed!
0385504225|2.0|Not a great one. I really liked the Davinci Code, which did not let me sleep until I finish it.  But Lost Symbol... Took five days to complete and I skipped few pages because it was boring and it has so many unnecessary and useless details. After reading 50-60% of the book, I was really waiting for the end.  Last 25-30 pages were totally boring. Few things sounded like very silly and stupid.
0316017922|2.0|Summary:    In this new book by the author of \\"The Tipping Point\\" and \\"Blink\\", Outliers takes quick look at stories of success of a few well-known individuals, (\\"outliers\\", people that have done something out of the ordinary).  The book then extends that to consider groups that fit this \\"outliers\\" success measure.  Forgive that applied to a group, the \\"outlier\\" definition may arguably not apply as well.  The book looks at some of the common perceptions about factors commonly attributed to outlier success.      The purpose appears to be to open the readers perception up to consider some additional important key factors in the success of an individual or or a particular group.  The average response suggested is that genius, (high IQ) coupled with individual effort achieves extraordinary result.  The author suggests that history, culture and opportunity/circumstance have had as much a role in notable success as genius and persistence.  The persistence and hard work argument still receives considerable emphasis by the author, but genius spark is discounted through his arguments in this readers opinion.    In all, not a great book, not much scientific research to support claims but does provide some points on culture and opportunity influences outcome, (or \\"success\\").    Read it if:  Your interested in a different perspective on what makes individuals often considered \\"genius\\" successful or not.  And seek additional motivation to persist and work very hard to achieve your goals.    Skip it if: You are already a big believer that hard work and dedication is as important as a genius spark in creating a successful outcome, (of your definition of successful outcome!).    Optimist's Outlook:  There is something to be learned from the perspective of hard work, dedication and extreme preparation in achieving ones goals or in pursuit of a highly successful outcome.    Cynic's Corner:  The book is a thinly veiled manifesto supporting the KIPP school methodology and inditement ofthe American Public School system methods.
B002BFBAWO|5.0|As you've no doubt heard, Adventureland was marketed as a teenage comedy in the vein of Superbad. Despite sharing the same director Greg Mottola (who also wrote this film), the two have little in common. In fact, Adventureland has more of a kinship with [[ASIN:B00009ZPTY All the Real Girls]] than Superbad. This is not a sex comedy or a teen-drug movie (although it does have drug content). Adventureland is a coming-of-age story that is much better than that description seems to imply. If you're expecting a hilarious comedy, this is not the movie for you as much of it's humor is more amusing and subtle as opposed to hilarious.    The year is 1987 and James (Jesse Eisenberg) is planning a graduation trip to Europe before he begins attending grad school in New York City. However, when James' parents fail to come through with the money for his trip, he's forced to get a summer job in Pittsburgh at Adventureland. There, he meets Emily (Kirten Stewart), an intriguing, yet withdrawn girl who can't commit due to an ongoing affair with Adventureland's custodian Connell (Ryan Reynolds).    This weak synopsis I've provided sounds like a typical \\"summer love\\" story but Mottola's a much better writer than that. He creates real, fleshed-out characters and never resorts to character cliches to present them. These characters are confused, passionate, intelligent...They have depth; something rarely found in these kinds of movies. Look at the relationship between James and Emily for evidence of this. Their relationship is touching, heartfelt, and genuine; a rarity for almost any movie let alone a comedy.    The movie takes place in the 1980s, but this is simply a nostalgic background for a story that is not confined to any particular time period. There's a broad range of emotions on display here due to both clever writing and impressive performances.    The stand-out here is Kirsten Stewart, who has been appearing in movies since a young age but has only recently found fame with her role in the Twilight series. Stewart displays real acting chops here, capturing the tough, withdrawn nature of her character in a way not every young actress could. She's a charmer, but you can see her as the kind of girl that lets you in just enough to have less of a distance to push you out. Eisenberg perfectly embodies the opposite of her character in his performance as James, which would be easier to applaud if I had seen Eisenberg play a character different from this one. He seems very comfortable at this point playing characters filled with virginal angst.    Bill Hader, as Adventureland's manager Bobby, seems to serve as the character with the funniest bits. His periodical outburts at people who don't properly dispose of their trash at the park are hilarious. Shockingly enough, Ryan Reynolds turns in a straight-forward performance dropping the Van Wilder-shtick he's seemingly carried over into every film he's done since that one.    In short, Adventureland really surprised me. Movies of this sort with realistic, well-drawn characters are really becoming obsolete and Adventureland does almost everything right. It's not a masterpiece but I enjoyed it so much I can't even pick out it's flaws. For this genre, it's a really great movie. It's really sad that this film doesn't have a wider audience and it certainly deserves one. If you watch this with an open mind, not expecting 'Superbad Redux' I think you'll find Adventureland to be a diamond in the rough; amusing and surprising in so many different areas.    GRADE: A-
B001GZOT32|5.0|\\"Eve\\" is not a pleasant look at relationships but that does not make it a bad album.  I always assumed that this album came about because someone needed to vent about a relationship gone bad.

0439023491|5.0|When Katniss won the Hunger Games, life was supposed to become simple. Her loved ones would never go hungry again, never get cold, never want for anything again. With the Capitol, things are never that simple.<br />The Capitol views what Katniss did in the arena to save Peeta and herself as an act of defiance. The districts view it as the hope they need. The spark of rebellion is lite.<br /><br />It's really hard to write this review without giving something away. I going to try to keep this spoiler free.<br /><br />In The Hunger Games we learned a little about the Capitol. We saw what life is like in District 12. We heard snippets of what life is like in the other Districts. In Catching Fire we learn just how much power the Capitol has over the people and how far they will go to keep it.<br /><br />Catching Fire starts off with a bang and the action doesn't stop. I was holding my breath until the very end. I have said it before but I will say it again, Suzanne Collins is a genius. The Hunger Games was an amazing book and she managed to follow it up with an equally amazing tale.<br /><br />I have always been a sucker for political intrigue and this trilogy has plenty of that.<br />Sometimes, in books the protagonist gets overshadowed by the side characters. Not Katniss. Even with a character as perfectly written as Peeta, he can't compete when it comes to Katniss. She is a voice that must be heard and will stay with you long after the last page. I just want to add that I love Peeta Mellark! If Katniss doesn't want him, can I have him?<br /><br />This trilogy is going to go down in history. It will definitely be on the classics shelf in the future. So read it!
B0029LHW4U|5.0|There's no way around it, the best of the Seattle bands is back. Cantrell and crew were smart, they toured for years with new singer William DuVall (formerly of Comes With The Fall) before writing and recording with him. By the time they got into the studio to make Black Gives Way To Blue everything was obviously working. They sound like Alice in Chains, and that's really what matters. William DuVall does not try to sound like Layne Staley, which is the right decision. Most poeple don't realize how much Jerry Cantrell sang on the classic stuff, so they'll be the most surprised at how the sound has remained true. At the same time, DuVall brings his own flavor to the mix that just works. It's as simple as that.    Check out \\"Check My Head\\" \\"Last of My Kind\\" \\"Your Decision\\" and \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" for a few highlights... plus Elton John on Piano on the title track is nice bonus.
B001QWBM62|4.0|Although the big push these days by Samson/Zoom is on behalf of their latest entry, the pint-sized H1, the H2 is still outselling it.  Perhaps for good reason.  Amazon's price has the H2 going for less than a 50% mark-up from the H1, yet only the H2 offers a sound stage as wide as 360 degrees and is almost as portable and easy to slip into a pocket as the H1.  The latter offers the now popular X/Z mic configuration, but they're \\"fixed\\" mics. if you wanted to ensure the widest separation, you'd be unable to aim the mics in opposing directions.  Also, the H2 can be set down on a flat surface more securely and is less sensitive to microphonics from touching any part of the machine.  I've owned both machines and have found the construction quality wanting, the SD door broke loose on the HD2, and the on-off switch came loose on the H1.  Both are somewhat tricky to operate, with settings that are not visible in dark places and which nonetheless require agile, accurate, and quick, small fingers.  (Some users are bound to react negatively to the minuscule size of the H1's micro-SDHC storage cards.)  Both are capable of full-bodied, full frequencied high-fidelity audio, but you have to remember to treat them gently.<br /><br />The Zoom Q3 video recorder strikes me as the best built of the bunch, as it's solid metal practically through and through, and the limited settings make it easier to use than either the H1 or H2.  However, I found it impractical to use at a concert where where the included video component distracted the listeners behind me.  Also, with its size and bright-blue color it's anything but a stealth machine.<br /><br />This brings us to the 4th (and most expensive) Zoom, the H4n.  It's the most versatile of the Zooms, not only permitting movement of the mics but the addition of external mics for authentic mixing.  Still, the build quality is not notably superior to the H2, and of the 4 Zooms, it's the fussiest, intended for a user whose willing to take some time to become familiar with its versatile learning curve.  After less than satisfying experiences with the first 3 Zooms, I sent the H4n back in favor of the Sony PCM-50, which is constructed like a Hummer compared to the plastic of the Zooms.  I see that Amazon's description of the Sony is misleading, since the PCM-50 will NOT permit the user to record in MP3 format.  WAV is the only format it offers, which simplifies the recording process, allowing the user to select file size with the software program used during the editing process.

0316044407|5.0|They say that a ghost remains tied to the world of the living either to avenge its death or to comfort those left behind. The heroine of Alice Sebold's haunting, sweet novel \\"The Lovely Bones\\" (now a soon-to-be-released Peter Jackson movie) isn't out for revenge, but her ties to the living family and friends make debut an amazing, uplifting story.<br /><br />Susie Salmon is dead. On a day like any other, she was raped and brutally murdered by a seemingly harmless neighbor, who hacked up her body and buried it. Now she exists in a surprisingly simple and pleasant heaven, watching her family and friends after she vanished, and watching their lives unfold even after hers has ended.<br /><br />Her parents cling to hope that even though a lot of blood and part of an arm has been found, that Susie is still alive. But eventually, they must give up hope. Susie watches the police investigate her death, while her father pokes around to find out whodunnit. And just as importantly her family and friends stumble through the various stages of grief, trying to deal with a horrible, senseless crime that has touched each of them.<br /><br />When someone is kidnapped and/or murdered, the news usually focuses on the criminals and the gory details. Not much attention is given to the victims and the lives they once led, or how their loves ones are dealing with the tragedy. Other books would be self-conscious or miserable dealing with that kind of story, but \\"Lovely Bones\\" is something very different.<br /><br />Instead, this book possesses a quiet, comforting tone and a poetic style, which sometimes gets bogged in its own detail, but is beautiful nonetheless. Sebold's writing has an innocent charm; one enchanting scene has Susie trying to make a flower bloom for her father, and filling a celestial room with flower petals instead.<br /><br />The only really gritty scene is the rape-and-murder, which is all the more shocking when you realize that things like this happen in real life. And Sebold paints the characters' grief and shock with a light hand, so that it never feels sentimental. It has the hollow ache of real grief, transcribed with more skill than more authors can manage.<br /><br />Susie herself is a truly unique character, a narrator completely removed from the events she describes, and yet so wrapped up in the people she loves, and has left behind. And Sebold explores the many characters as they go through the grieving process, with different thoughts and actions as they try to deal with it. The parents, the siblings, the teachers, and even the kid who was enamored of Susie.<br /><br />Alice Sebold's \\"Lovely Bones\\" shocks you at the beginning, and spends the rest of the book drying your tears.

B000007ODX|5.0|I don't agree with the reviewer who awarded this recording three stars on the grounds that there are \\"better alternatives\\" available. I fully accept that Moravec and Arrau bring a special magic to this repertoire. However, one should perhaps not set the bar so high:  Barenboim's set is undoubtedly one of the very best modern recordings of the Nocturnes, and it does benefit from excellent digital sound technology, which will be a major plus point for many listeners. Barenboim also offers perfect control of tempi, a quality vitally important in these works which nonetheless seems to elude so many pianists. I actually prefer this recording to Rubinstein's RCA recording of the Nocturnes, as Barenboim (like Arrau) brings a weightier tone and seems to dig deeper into the mystery and tragedy pervading these works.

1594488878|5.0|I love this book.  I love this book.  I love this book.<br /><br />There, have I said it enough?<br /><br />This isn't a spoiler review.  If you want a plot synopis, by all means, move on.<br /><br />The story opens in a dreary British seaside town, in the current day.  Our main characters are a late thirty-something couple.  He's a college professor and aficionado of a reclusive ex-eighties musician who reminds one of, well, Jandek, before Jandek actually started doing concerts.  She is a museum curator, who is longing for a better life, and a child, somewhere a lot less boring.<br /><br />The book is full of lines like, \\"Where in the North of England could one find an unattached arts graduate?  We went to  North Bumblebee; supposedly there had been one there four or five years ago.\\"  Much of this is howlingly, bitterly funny.<br /><br />If I tell you what happens, it will ruin the plot, so I'll tell you what it's not:  this isn't a continuation of, \\"High Fidelity\\";  it's not a story about stoically finding happiness in what you have; it's slightly anti-British--America looks like the place to be; its main thesis seems to be that leaving adolescence, and more importantly, having children, is the secret to long-term happiness.<br /><br />This is a lot about looking back, and ending what doesn't work.  For many Gen-X'ers in their late thirties, this may hit a little too close too home.<br /><br />So, if you were rooting for the commitment-phobic, rock musician obsessed guy in this story, um, well, not the book for you.  If however, you are hopeful, family friendly (gack, did I just say that?), rooting for the woman looking for the baby, and possibly the aging very ex-rock star, then this is just grand.<br /><br />P.S.  Some of the jokes may rely on familiarity with Northern England stereotypes.  (If you've seen, \\"Hot Fuzz\\", and \\"Kids in the Hall\\", you should be fine.)
B002JM1VJG|4.0|In the days where MTV is playing pimps being lapdanced by topless strippers, Madonna releases her video collection with a censored version of Justify My Love and Erotica.  Once upon a time Madonna swore over and over she would rather cancel shows rather than change them or censor her videos.   Well apparently she's become even greedier with age because the \\"never seen footage of Justify My Love\\" that was taunted pre-release is nothing more but a black stripe covering the dominatrix's nipples in the video! And Erotica has no nudity.   So, I don't understand WHY she is realeasing two versions of this dvd collection, one in amaray case and one in digipack. Who wants that? Why not do something really smart and at least do one of those with a friggin' parental advisory sticker and give the grown-up fans what she knows they wanted?  Hopefully now that Madonna is no longer with Warner Bros they will milk her catalogue like a cow  and release everything she's done and not care about this unspoken rule of \\"always keep some things unreleased so we can milk the fans in the future!\\".  My balls hit the floor when I saw that black stripe on Justify My Love.

For those of you who, like me, have read most of his books already, the following is for you:  Interesting science-fiction premise, familiar Alistair Reynolds blend of noir and hard science fiction, a bit disappointing in the character development and 'page-turner' aspects.  I still liked it, so if you want to read one of his novels and have read everything else, go for it, you'll still enjoy it.
0385504225|4.0|I like a book that teaches me something. And for that reason, I gave Dan Brown four stars. When I finished the book, I felt that my life had somehow been enriched with all the new knowledge that I acquired. Having said that I would add that Robert Langdon seemed to have become 'dumber' than he was in Angels and Demons and DaVinci Code. Although in the book he is sought after for his knowledge, he repeatedly has, 'no that can't be, oh I guess it is!' moments. The violent scenes appear to be written for a movie. And the end gets very 'preachy'; many pages with paragraphs of dialogue-no action. But I must say, I can't wait to revisit DC with my new perspective. I wonder how many tv specials will focus on all that this book brings to light. Thanks for the enlightening education, Dan Brown.

B002HNA95E|4.0|Warner Bros. has released Madonna's third compilation album featuring some of Madonna's biggest hits (fourth if you count the ballad collection 'Something To Remember'). 'Celebration' is a great collection of some of Madonna's best work but as any true fan will attest, this is far from a true 'greatest hits' album. If you are a casual Madonna fan, 'Celebration' is really a good album to pick-up. The main staples --- 'Material Girl', 'Ray of Light', 'Like a Prayer' --- are all present. There are even two new songs. Yet, something feels unsatisfying with 'Celebration' considering there are so many songs that were left off. Considering this is her last release with Warner Bros, I felt much more effort could have been put into making this a true 'celebration' of her music and career over the past 26 years. Instead, it feels like one last attempt made by Warner to make money off Madonna.<br /><br />The Good: I really like all the effort and attention put into the package design. Warner Bros. definitely stepped up their promotion and art direction on this release -- more so than they have her past few albums. The art designed by Mr. Brainwash is definitely different and more street and while there are no new photos of Madonna, I felt the design really does her justice and features her most iconic looks and styles in a creative manner. I like both of the new songs featured on this edition. 'Celebration' is pure dance and sounds like a cut from \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" while 'Revolver' (featuring a small rap by Lil' Wayne) is a mix between pop and urban music, everything \\"Hard Candy\\" tried to be but perhaps failed to live up to. To me, the songs are both very good and easily stand out as album worthy tracks. Another great thing about this release is that the tracks have been remastered and as someone who has listened to many of the tracks often, I can tell the difference and it makes listening to some of the older tracks like 'Dress You Up' and 'Like a Prayer' all the more enjoyable.<br /><br />The Bad: Again, to the casual Madonna fan, 'Celebration' offers a nice spread of songs throughout her career. To the hardcore fan, this release is disappointing. Tracks like 'True Blue', 'Spotlight', 'Bad Girl' and 'Human Nature' are all left off. Some of the songs on here are edits from the first 'greatest hits' package, 'The Immaculate Collection'. Other edits simply don't do the songs justice (Why cut out the dramatic beginning of '4 Minutes' and break the song down to a mere 3 minutes, ten seconds? Doesn't that go against the whole theme of the song?). Also, the release is sparse on the side of some of her older ballads (Where's 'You'll See' and why is 'Miles Away' included when it didn't really make an impact?). I get the impression that this release, like many of Madonna's 'greatest hits' packages, was put out without a lot of thought or effort. If you're a big Madonna fan, there's no reason to own this because you have a lot of the songs (full versions, mind you, not edits) and are left with just 2 new songs that you can probably purchase as mp3s on Amazon separately. This could have been a true 'celebration' and featured new edits or remixes and takes on the classic songs to make everything dance-floor ready but it seems as if all the attention were put into the package art rather than the actual content.<br /><br />In all, if you are new to Madonna and want a collection of her music from all eras and albums of her career, this will be a nice addition to your collection. You will definitely get a nice sampling of her music that will hopefully inspire you to pick up her albums to enjoy the full tracks and other undiscovered ones. If you are the casual fan or even hardcore, 'Celebration' is more for your collection than a must-purchase. There are only two new tracks; the rest of 'Celebration' is a compilation of radio edits, or mixes from the past greatest hits packages released by Warner Music. If you want the true Madonna experience, I recommend saving your money on this purchase and putting it toward the 2-DVD music video collection that is also newly released. It featured remastered video, remastered music, 47 videos and definitely features more of the hits and lesser known tracks of her career. It's worth the purchase while this on the other hand doesn't really feel like a real 'greatest hits' package and more so a sampling of some of her best.<br /><br />Listen To These Tracks: 'Revolver' (featuring Lil' Wayne), 'Celebration'our money on this purchase and putting it toward the 2-DVD music video collection that is also newly released.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I don't want to repeat what everyone else has been saying, just to add a few personal comments.  Great DVD.  I've done many others before.  I'm 54, weight 115, pretty good shape (a bit fluffy) and lack cardio fitness.  I'm very, very pleased.  Surely the most effective exercise DVD I've ever done.  Upper body gets a tough workout (shoulders, arms.  Just hate the long, long, long intro that can't be fast forwarded.  For people rushed in the morning and trying to get it done, definately a bad marketing decision.      I would love to have a DVD from her of just abs and hips/thighs.  I've had no problem with the abs at all on Level 2.  Moving up to Level 3 next week.    Background music is terrible but then, again, I bought this for the exercises not the music.    I had never watched Biggest loser but turned it on after buying this and I think she's a hard person. She may get the job done but I wish she had a little more compassion thrown in.  OK, I know that's her style but if I were on the show I wouldn't be able to put up with someone yelling at me like that.  Seems a little inhumane.  Anyway, if you want to get in shape, willing to work hard for 20 minutes and can put up with the miscounts on repetitions, then go for it.  I know my body has changed literally in 5 weeks.
B002M2N9JI|4.0|If you want something very fun, electronic, pop with a heavy 1980s vibe, La Roux is for you. What I enjoy most about La Roux and her debut album is that it is unlike anything on the radio today. She is not trying to follow any popular music trends; she clearly knows what genre of music fits her best and this album feels very retro while feeling very futuristic at the same time.<br /><br />The Good: I loved the instrumentals/beats. When I first listened to the album, I thought this was some forgotten 1980s album. The vibe of the album sounds retro but doesn't seem dated at all. It's an odd blend of what made 80s music so fun while somehow keeping its hand and eyes set on the future (perhaps with the use of the computer to alter the voice, giving the album an at times robotic/electronic vibe). The music is carefree and the lyrics are also interesting; nothing entirely deep but at the same time, not frivolous and without a message. I also felt La Roux's vocals stood out on the album. While some of the vocals are processed and run through autotune and computer tweaks, La Roux does sing in a very raw, organic manner on other tracks and is able to really communicate emotion and depth while many artist don't seem to give any thought to what they are singing or how their voice can change the entire tone of the album.<br /><br />The Bad: With all the synth and electronic treatment is what gives the album its flair and attitude, it also gets somewhat repetitive after a few tracks. This is the style carried out not on one or two tracks but on every track. In a way, it distracts and makes the tracks blend into one and makes some tracks fade or retreat into one another rather than standing out as they should.<br /><br />In all, La Roux's debut album does what few are able to do; she leaves a lasting impression and has the listener wanting more by the end. The music is addictive, fun, carefree and La Roux herself has a very unique style and her vocal style and musical preferences definitely give this album a lot of feeling and character. Definitely worth purchasing.<br /><br />Listen To These Tracks: 'Cover My Eyes', 'Bulletproof', 'Tigerlily', 'I'm Not Your Toy', 'Fascination'bum a lot of feeling and character. Definitely worth purchasing.    Listen To These Tracks: 'Cover My Eyes', 'Bulletproof', 'Tigerlily', 'I'm Not Your Toy', 'Fascination'
B00006BTCA|4.0|Still one of the better introductive indie rock releases of the decade, guided by a boldly assertive streak of beginning tracks, Interpol's debut avoids a conscious songwriting strain early success brought with future output, instead providing more effortlessly angular, darkened pop, properly emulating the oft-milked Joy Division prototype.
B002BFBAWO|5.0|I enjoyed this movie but more or less it was a flashback to my high school days..  I picked up a few mistakes that were made in the movie.  For example the Pacer that Em was driving, there was a red pattern on the seat and then all the sudden it was tan.  I enjoyed sharing this movie with my daughter.
B000006TRV|4.0|Although it lacks the vision behind Beatle's White or the dexterity of Lamb Lies from Genesis, The Wall can take its place amongst rock's finer double album's; if not accentuating production subtlety certainly producing a virtual hit factory which could joyously be disassembled piece by piece.
1416955070|5.0|Excellent characters, great action & pacing, compelling story line, and flat out fun read - start to finish.  I ripped through it once and then read it again leisurely.  This is simply a terrific YA book.  Am looking forward to book 2.    Clare has created a world with a mix of familiar fantasy types (werewolves, vampires, warlocks) and those which don't get much print:  the nephilim.  And her treatment of these is refreshing.  Is realistic fantasy a term?      Whether a teen or an adult who enjoys a great tale -- do give The Mortal Instrument series a go!  Happy reading.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|This concert is around 2 - 2 1/2 hours along and Michael just doesn't stop.  I realize he was in his early 30's in 1992 but he still has the most amazing energy, moves and connects to every single person in the audience.  He is amazing, I can't say it enough.      One of the reviewers stated that there was a lot of lip synching.  I completely disagree.  You can tell that Michael is singing the whole time.  With any extraordinarily choreographed performance you will have some back track vocals for certain pieces but that is to be expected.    Michael is wonderful and really loves his fans, you can feel it through the entire concert.  He is so missed and it is almost mind-boggling to know that we will never see someone like Michael again in our lifetime.  That time is done and it's so sad.  It makes me want to turn back time and somehow make things turn out differently.  I am so happy that I was alive during Michael's most creative years and to watch him take the world by storm.  His music is such a part of my entire life, I can place certain MJ songs with every phase of my 35 years.    RIP Michael, we love you!

0385504225|2.0|What a let-down! I have been waiting for Dan Brown's latest book, for I so enjoyed \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" But, if this is what he has been doing the last four years, he needs to do some more work.  Of course, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is a hard thriller to beat, but this work doesn't even come close to the fun, the suspense of \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" The Masons? Yawn. And, another weird religious guy, another intelligent woman helping Dan out, another mentor who is in trouble, and need I go on? The book is a weak copycat of the previous novel. While I agree with the book's message, we have sparks of divinity in each of us, that is nothing new.  Yes, I also believe that the founding fathers would be shocked at the rise of religious extremism in this country, but couldn't Dan have written a better book to showcase that theme? I wish he had.
B002BE7JEI|5.0|i dont have to talk about the Movie cause everybody knows its one of the best Movies with Kathy Bates i just want to say that i was so surpriced about the BD wounderful picture very dood sound the Movie company did a very good job to make this Blu Ray and iam glad that i got it here from amazon.com here in Germany there are still waiting for the BD!!So buy it you wont get disapointed its awesome
B000XCZGVI|5.0|I'm not sure if I submitted a review of this but I have seen this absorbing David Fincher film twice, once in the theater and again in HD DVD--and it is awesome.  Like the numerous details that Fincher incorporates in the film to keep on your toes, the HD DVD version boast almost 3-D like realism and I'm sure the Blu-Ray version is the same except that it does cost considerably more than $8!!  Don't be put off by the length of this film, you surely will not be bored and there are several frightful moments in this docu-drama that will surely make you jump. Compared to the trashy slasher movies that are coming out of Hollywood, this film is a true original in its own low-keyed way--it grips you and won't let go.  I feel this film even more than \\"Seven\\" establishes Fincher as the best young director out there since Scorsese!!
B002IVLH6A|5.0|The only other Pearl Jam album I own is Ten, so I obviously can't leave very informed feedback. I just want to say that I love their new cd Backspacer. It's got an energy I don't think I've heard from Pearl Jam since the 90s. They sound like they're having fun and it's absolutely infectious. I bought this at my local Target for $11.99 only because they had a giant display by the checkout and then listened to it three times in a row. If you're low on funds right now, still buy this cd. It's worth it and it's guaranteed to put a smile on your face.

1416594787|5.0|The examples are solid and the arguments are clear. If you know anyone who is still on the fence this is the book for them. They may get a bit mired in the science at times which is always the case with Dawkins, but you can't escape those moments when he leads you right to the answer. The sections on the works of Richard Lenski and John Endler really drive it home with the kind of information you should pass along. The section on dating is also very clear. Good stuff.
B002CAWNEM|4.0|September 28th, 2009<br /><br />Let me start out by saying that Beyonc&eacute;'s man (Idris Elba) is the perfect example of what a husband should be: imperfect, but very close to perfection.<br /><br />He didn't stray from his wife and kept his ground during a lot of stuff that the \\"obsessed\\" put him through.<br /><br />I think this movie is underrated here. 2 1/2 stars my butt. This movie was good.<br /><br />Maybe it WAS a re-tread of some movies but it was still very entertaining, with bits and pieces of goodness on the way until the finale which was just short of excellence.<br /><br />Every one of the main characters acted their butts off, and that includes the deranged temp who was in love with B's man.<br /><br />The movie starts off with her and her husband moving into a beautiful (and big) house, where they plan on spending a great deal of their lives together. They move in with their young son and make things cozy. Edris goes to work quite often and brings home the bacon as Beyonc&eacute; provides a stay-at-home environment for her child, Kyle (or is it Cal? Hard to understand sometimes).<br /><br />The action doesn't really happen until the end so you will just have to hold on.<br /><br />All in all, a good watch and worth the rent.<br /><br />3.75 stars would be a perfect rating but since I enjoyed it so, I am rating it at a<br /><br />4 stars.
B001T3RA8M|5.0|Sabriel is a great book.<br /><br />I was surprised that there are not a ton of reviews.<br /><br />Sabriel is finishing high school in a early 1900s Britain type setting, when a cryptic messenger sends her father's sword and bells. Turns out Sabriel is from the magical border kingdom that nobody believes in. Her father is a necromancer that puts dead people back to dead (a good necromancer). Sabriel goes to rescue him, and adventure ensues. It's a coming of age, unsure teenage girl, meets boy and fights evil type thing.<br /><br />I won't tell you more, as I don't want to ruin the plot. I would recommend this more for a teenage girl, but I am an adult man who read this some years ago and still likes it. It is appropriate for young adult readers. It has doesn't overly use gory details, or scare; but it does deal with death more than the average young adult novel.<br /><br />The next books in the series are also good.

B002DKF47O|5.0|I'm a native of Poland and it sure is great to hear something like this coming out of a country I feel is so deprived of heavy metal. Behemoth has taken their throne for best Polish Death Metal band. I do not recommend this for someone who does not like death metal.  I recommend this album to Behemoth fans and death metal fans in general. This review should be helpful enough, so death metal fans enjoy and non-death metal fans stay away. Simple enough :)
B002HNA95E|5.0|Ok, I hate to admit it, I like Madonnas music. I have always liked her music, even when I was a little kid. I own Music, Confessions, and the Confessions Tour cd's, and I had to get this because it saved me money from buying all the other cd's she has out. My friends pick on me a lot for liking Madonna, and they criticize me for having Madonna next to Slayer in my cd book. WHO CARES what kind of music I listen to, i am a fan of music, and also happen to be a fan of Madonna. I think she looks real good for her age, and her songs get better and better over the years as well. I plan on getting the dvd with the videos on it too soon because I remember watching them on MTV and VH1 growing up. I recommend this collection to anybody who is like me, likes the songs, but doesn't want to drop the money to buy all the albums for the songs that are easily stuck in your head. This collection here has all the songs of hers that used to get stuck in my head all the time. There were many nights working at KFC singing Madonna songs while washing dishes, it made getting the dishes done faster! Plus it motivated everyone else to get their work done faster so I would stop singing! Oh, those were the days. But all in all, this is a great collection of songs by a talented and beautiful lady.    I recently bought the dvd collection, and I give it a four and a half star rating. Not because there was problems with the picture quality like what most people are complaining about, but because of the missing videos (and I later came to the conclusion that those videos and songs must not have been from WB, or so I am guessing anyways). As for the picture quality of the videos, I had no problems at all with it. I had no pixilation, fuzziness, blurriness, or anything of the sorts at all. I play my dvds on a normal progressive scan dvd player dvd recorder, and had no problems with quality at all. Just to compare what a five star music video collection would be, that title would go the the Beastie Boys DVD Video Anthology Criterion Collection. There were some missing videos on that collection too, but there were multiple video angle options for some of the songs, and a majority of the songs also had multiple audio options too. Some of the key video angle options for that collection was the different views of the Sabotage video, Intergalactic video, Shadrach video, and a few others. The audio options for that collection too included remixes, a cappella versions, and a commentary from the band about the making of the video.  I know that the Beastie Boys ain't Madonna and Madonna ain't the Beastie Boys, but if the Madonna collection had options like that, it would have been AWESOME, and worth maybe a twenty star rating! So screw what the nay-sayers say, go buy this dvd already DAMN IT!
B000002P86|3.0|Unlike 'Lucille and Friends', 'Deuces Wild' is a collection of more recently-recorded B.B King duets and collaborations. Once again, there is a mixture of standard blues and roots covers and original songs. If anything, the range of artists and styles present here is even greater than on 'Lucille and Friends', making it a more interesting but perhaps less consistent album.     The best tracks here include takes on 'The Thrill Is Gone' (Tracy Chapman) and 'Rock Me Baby' (Eric Clapton), two songs which were hits for King himself in the distant past. 'Baby I Love You' (Bonnie Raitt), 'Confessing the Blues' (Marty Stuart) and 'Dangerous Mood' (Joe Cocker) are other strong songs. A great rendition of 'Paying The Cost To Be The Boss' with Mick Jagger on vocals is a highlight, 'Night Life' with Willie Nelson provides a surprisingly poignant closer, and 'Keep It Coming' with rapper Heavy D is not quite as embarassing as it might have been. Interestingly, a couple of songs from 'Lucille and Friends' are present in new arrangements, but unfortunately neither 'Hummingbird' (Dionne Warwick) nor 'Let The Good Times Roll' (Zucchero) match the standard of the original versions.    A solid collection that is not quite as strong as 'Lucille And Friends'. The diversity of the collaborators means they don't always gel with B.B., although once again King proves his ability to adapt his singing and playing to many different styles. It's maybe a bit too calculated and over-thought, and lacks some of the spontaneity of the older tracks on 'Lucille...'. It's still a good enough effort, though, and will be of interest to B.B fans old and new.
B002KVSJ64|4.0|Breaking Benjamin's newest release is a slight mix of We Are Not Alone and Phobia, although it mostly resembles Phobia in its tone and ambitions. The songs themselves have nice lyrics, but they all sound a little too similar to each other. The melodic choruses are nice as are some of the heavier additions to this release, but they seemed to just pull back a bit from previous releases. I guess if it has worked before, they must figure that it would work again, and for the most part they are right. Next album though I would like a bit more edge and maybe a bit of experimentation to not sound just like before.     Standout Tracks: Without You, Fade Away, I Will Not Bow, and Into The Nothing.
0385504225|2.0|A quick review of the last 10 books that I've read tells me that this is the worst of the bunch.  Dan Brown sells out in order to keep his publisher happy and maintain their schedule for releasing a new book.  I agree with many of the previous reviewers who point out the obvious, that Dan Brown just copied and pasted from \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" changed a few names & references, and published this book.<br /><br />Much of the book was suspenseful and enjoyable to read, but I was surprised to find that there were also some really dull sections of the book that made me want to stop reading altogether.  There are definitely several sections of the book where Dan Brown nearly repeats himself verbatim, particularly when referencing the histories of various religions and civilizations; this is dull to the point that I just started to skim over portions and not even read them.  In addition, the final 10% of the book is an absolute boring waste of time; this was the most difficult portion of the book to read.<br /><br />I would recommend reading both \\"Angels & Demons\\" and \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" but I would put this book more on par with Dan Brown's \\"Deception Point;\\"  in fact, I would rate this book below \\"Deception Point\\" because of the dull spots throughout \\"The Lost Symbol.\\"  What's frustrating is that Dan Brown clearly has the potential to write good books, but he sells himself short with this one.  I fell for the notion that if this is the #1 selling book on Amazon, then it must be good.  My advice is don't make the same mistake that I did because there are many other well-written, enjoyable books out there.
0525421033|5.0|If I Stay is a bittersweet, absolutely amazing book about love, loss, family, friends, and most of all choices, particularly the ones Mia has to make after the car crash one day that kills her mom, dad, and baby brother, Teddy.<br /><br />It starts off with a sweet, almost-too-perfect chapter with Mia and her family, and that made me think, Oh no... this will be just TOO cloyingly perfect to enjoy.

And there was this weird thing with Brooke Vega in it that kind of made me cringe a bit. But other than that I loved it.<br /><br />It did have a rather abrupt ending, and any other time that would have bothered me- and for a few minutes, I was bothered- I wasn't ready for it to be over! But then I thought about it, and I think it really worked best. Had it been even one sentence longer it would have lost a lot of its impact.<br /><br />Mia was just such a wonderful character. At first, like I mentioned, she seemed just too perfect, but throughout the book, you really get to know Mia better than I've seen in most any other book, all her faults, her feelings, her fears, insecurities. And she had so many layers and so much texture, you felt like you were her, not just reading her words.<br /><br />And the writing was just fantastic. Forman knew just what to write to convey Mia's emotion, her thoughts, right down to the letter. Mia plays cello, and the writing kind of reminded me of cello music- it flowed wonderfully, and it was sweet, sad and... I really don't know what other word to use besides this, it's one of those annoying irrelevant words on the back of books in the praise part- poignant. That may sound a little sappy, oops!<br /><br />Another thing I loved about this book was how it interchanged between fond past memories of her family and friends, and the harsh present, and listening to all the stories she had to tell of the past.

B000HMOYIU|5.0|Christensen writes about the failure of good, well-managed companies to stay atop their industries when they are confronted by certain types of disruptive market and technological change. This has happened in industries that move fast and those that move slow, and in manufacturing and service industries. Companies that fell prey to these disruptive changes include Sears, IBM, DEC, Xerox, and integrated steel manufacturers.<br /><br />What is a 'disruptive technology?' A new approach that few, if any, current customers want, but possibly offers new applications and eventually higher performance - eg. smaller, more expensive data discs that offer nothing to existing customers but might work in new, unknown volume applications. The new technology's potential volumes aren't attractive to management (don't meet their immediate growth needs), the opportunity is ignored and the developers  eventually become frustrated and leave to join a smaller firm that is interested, or start their own. Often eventually the new technology outperforms the old, allowing those that have developed and utilized it to not only pursue the new applications but have an advantage in pursuing the old users.<br /><br />Christensen defines \\"sustaining\\" technologies as those that improve the performance of established products along dimensions that major customers have historically valued. \\"Disruptive\\" technologies, on the other hand, generally under-perform established products in major markets but have new features that a few new/fringe customers value - generally smaller, cheaper, simpler (eg. PCs, discount retailing, off-road motorcycles, transistors, and HMOs).<br /><br />Disruptive technologies, when viewed by \\"rational\\" decision-makers, offer lower margins (due to their generally cheaper and simpler nature), are first commercialized in new or small markets (thus, they don't solve large corporations' growth needs), and are not valued by major, current customers. Thus, they wait for new market entrants to exploit their potential, and the strong, existing firms risk becoming obsolescent due their being late to change.ir potential, and the strong, existing firms risk becoming obsolescent due their being late to change.

B002POMLHY|5.0|Probably the best out of all 4 albums. Hopeless, I Will Not Bow, Anthem Of Angels, Into The Nothing are mind blowing.    I love about 10/11 songs. Give Me A Sign is a bit too emotional, but with time, I'll learn to like it.    Seriously..... what albums nowadays makes you appreciate 90% of their content? Breaking Benjamin best Rock band atm.
B001LF347E|5.0|I love this show. It's about time there is something quality on television, instead of the reality garbage we can't seem to get rid of. I love the storyline, I love the acting, I love the lessons taught in each episode. Some of the episodes/monsters may be too scary for younger children. However, I am eager to make this series a part of my home collection! I'd feel very comfortable with my teenagers watching these. It's nice to have something entertaining to watch that leaves a smile on your face when you're through. You don't have to worry about language, sex, etc. in this show. I can't wait to see more! Kids and adults alike will enjoy this show. If you're looking for something for your family, this is it.
0439023491|5.0|The first book The Hunger Games, was a great book. I was not sure how the second could compare. I was not let down with the second. There are moments of disbelief and excitement through this book. The ending left off with an even bigger cliff hanger than the Hunger Games. I think the third will be even better. I am looking forward to it very much. I don't think there are many people who would not like this book. The first should be read read first, however, as the story heavily relies on the story from the first book.
0060878770|5.0|This was beautifully written.  The way Plath flexes the words to describe the smallest emotional experience is so right on the money, it felt like Ester's experiences were mine own.  I just finished The Graduate, and found the depression and weakness of the main character disgusting and pathetic.  After reading/listening to Maggie Gyllenhaal bring this book to life, the disgusting depression that The Graduate presented was clearly a failed attempt to make the transition from college to real life and the depression that can come with it tangible for the reader.   I wish Sylvia Plath had written more.  I love her style, the elegant transitions, and the honey she offers to pull you in.  OH and Gyllenhaal's performance is A+ work.  Her voice was very easy to follow, her cadence was perfect and the way she took on the character made me feel like I was living the whole thing.  LOVED IT it is like a great movie...only longer! Maybe I'll listen again!

I hope it will be better, since it's the rebellion. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad I bought it. It's just that I really LOVED The Hunger Games, and I only liked Catching Fire.
B001QXE0OC|5.0|I love this cd so much.  All the songs are really upbeat and makes you want to move when you listen to them.  My favorite track out of all of them is track 8 More, it is just really fun to listen to.  Highly recommend to anyone who is a Selena Gomez fan or to anyone who is looking for some party songs to listen to.
0061730327|5.0|The Exceptional Story of the Boy Who Harnessed the Wind    by Nathaniel Whittemore    categories: africa, The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind    Published September 29, 2009 @ 01:53AM PT    In the early 21st century, Malawi was gripped by one of the worst famines the nation had ever seen. Around the country, crops fell and subsistence farmers were forced to migrate, wandering in search of work and food. As resources dwindled, more and more families were forced to make the desperate decision to pull their children from school to help at home. One of those students who could no longer afford school was William Kamkwamba. Yet as is so often the case, from the tragedy of the famine came an incredible story of a young person whose persistent creativity and indefatigable spirit led to incredible things. This is the exceptional story of the Boy Who Harnessed the Wind.    The Africa of William Kamkwamba's youth was a place still caught between tradition and modernity. As he put it in the first lines of his wonderful new book \\"The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind,\\" \\"Before I discovered the miracle of science, magic ruled the world.\\"    The first part of the story is about his world before that discovery. It's a world in which the characters are the friends he got into trouble with, the towering adults who commanded his understanding of the world, the landscapes that form his playground, back yard, and first school. The early part of the story is notable not just for its evocative depiction of African village life, but because it feels so resonant with the experience of growing up anywhere - particularly for young boys for whom every day is a new exploration and a new adventure.    Where William's story departs is as famine strikes in 2001 and 2002. The rains come late, threatening the crops that form the backbone of Malawi's economy and the primary mode of subsistence for most of her citizens. The government is slow to respond, and people are forced to take dramatic measures to scrimp and survive. Commerce grinds to a halt.    For William, the consequence was that food dwindled and his family could no longer afford to pay his school fees, and he was forced to drop out as his classmates go on. By some luck, he found his way to a local USAID funded library, where he discovered a book about electronics. He had already done some rudimentary experimenting, and the book was filled with diagrams became William's constant companion as he spent his days experimenting with circuitry.    As he became more and more adept, William began to focus on building a windmill - a contraption he had seen on the cover of another book. Not able to buy even basic supplies, he trolled around junkyards to find the spare parts he needed to put something together. Enduring teasing and accusations of lunacy, William persisted, finally building a windmill that could power lights - and eventually an irrigation system - in his house.    Before long, his story became known around his region, eventually attracting the attention of blogger Emeka Okafor, who was planning the first ever TED conference to be held in Africa. William spoke at that event, and since then has launched a foundation, begun attending school at the African Leadership Academy in South Africa, and now, writing this book, is working to be an exemplar of the notion that if you try, you can succeed.    I had the privilege to read an advanced copy of the book, and wrote: \\"Much more than a memoir, this is a snapshot of life as a precocious teenager in contemporary Africa, and an affirmation of the notion that talent, beauty, and brilliance are distributed in equal measure around the world, even if opportunity is not. This is a story that hums with the excitement of an individual who, like the continent where he was raised, is poised for greatness.\\"    The book abounds with themes that resonate deeply: the idea that with hard work and persistence comes triumph; that optimism is not a mental state but a type of action, that from grief and loss can come success; that ultimately, no one has responsibility for your education and success except you. Indeed, these are themes likely to resonate deeply with an American public that loves to see something resembling the \\"American Dream\\" in action.    Yet there is something nagging about this story as well. I called this post the \\"exceptional story\\" because of the dual meaning of that word. William is an exceptional young man who could teach us all something about taking our destiny into our hands. But he is also exceptional because the happy ending of his story is still so at odds with the reality for so much of the developing world. For every William who succeeds there is a William who is set up to fail by the accident of fate of where they were born, and what that means about the resources they can draw on to succeed and what will stand in their way.    The tremendous injustice that we must grapple with as we read a story like William's is that in this world we do not all start with a blank slate and an equal chance to succeed. We all have a chance to do our best with our lot, but we must not allow ourselves to forget the debt that we owe to luck.    The reason to read William's book is to celebrate the idea that even at great odds, the good can triumph. But it also must be to recognize our opportunities to better pave the way for future William's and make sure that they have the same chance to use their unique talents, whatever they may be, to harness their very own wind.
B000NJVWUA|5.0|I always felt the original Arista CD was poorly mastered for this album.  When I played this new remaster by Parsons himself - I was immediatly blown away.  The sound quality and fidelity far surpasses any re-mastered album I have ever heard on CD to this point.  Love all the extra bonus rare tracks - 8 in all which is an extra treat.  Please if your into real high fidelity sound get the CD not the MP3's theres a Big difference no matter how you average it out in quality - 1,440 kilobyes per second on CD comared to the Best MP3 which tops at 320kbs.  The packageing on the cd and the new linear notes: Who played what on each song - and additional graphics, photo's make getting this modestly priced CD so worth the while getting over Downloading the MP3's. For thoes with mp3 players, many mp3 players such as Ipod will play .wav files, or you can convert the songs from the CD to your ipod, thus keeping a high quality master CD for future use if technology changes etc... A++++++ Great Job Alan P.

B001QXE0OC|5.0|This CD is normal teen music, sung by Disney star who is so popular so she decides she should sing. I like the CD, and all the songs seem to be about same subject, nothing mature or serious. All about crushes or boy/girl relationships, but almost all pop songs are like this. I'm a Selena Gomez fan, so that's why I bought the CD, and it seems there's nothing so special to attract non-Selena fans. I rate the music not as good as Demi Lovato or Aly & AJ, but as good or better than Miley Cyrus. In fact, she has a very generic kind of voice that sounds like Miley Cyrus.

B002KVSJ64|5.0|Breaking Benjamin, Dear Agony (Hollywood, 2009)<br /><br />I've been a huge Breaking Benjamin fan pretty much from the first time I heard \\"So Cold.\\" (This may surprise folks who know my usual listening tastes, which run more to noise and powerelectronics, but let's face it--can you name any other current rock band who explores the same themes as all my favorite PE acts, and then can get them into the American Top 40? Of course not. None others exist.) But, you know, they've always been your basic common-time guitar-wall rock band. So when the verse kicked in on \\"Fade Away\\", the first song on Breaking Benjamin's fourth album, Dear Agony, I started wondering if I had a bad copy. And then it happened again in the second verse, and I realized that Breaking Benjamin were... syncopating. Seriously. Honest to god. Granted, fans of more complex rock bands (think Rush/Tool/3/any band who's ever released a rock and roll song using a time signature like 9/8) probably wouldn't even notice. But for your basic four-on-the-floor rock and roll band, that half-note jog Burnley does with the vocals halfway through each verse of \\"Fade Away\\" is a quantum jump. I wonder what album #5 will eventually sound like?<br /><br />They head back into their standard sound after that, and I'm not going to complain about that one little bit; Phobia was one of my favorite albums of 2006. While my first seven or eight spins of the disc have only produced one song that grabbed me by the cojones the way that \\"Evil Angel\\" and \\"Unknown Soldier\\" did the first time I heard Phobia (that, by the way, being \\"Crawl\\"), the album as a whole feels more coherent than anything BB have come up with to date. I really didn't think they could outdo Phobia for simple, straightforward songwriting and We Are Not Alone for the almost gleeful perversity of Burnley's lyrics (\\"I brought you to life just to hear you scream\\" is one of those lines that make me wonder why anyone who doesn't enjoy powerelectronics has discovered these guys), but this is it. Who was the last rock band to release four great albums in a row? (Upon reflection, while writing the rest of this, I did come up with one--Pre-Black-Album Metallica.) Especially four albums in the same vein; the consistency of the band's style is such that, for the most part, you can stick a song from Dear Agony next to a song from Saturate and play them both for a newb. Ask him which one's newer. You'll get a confused look. Usually I hate that sort of thing in a band (the only other exception I can think of right now is Legendary Pink Dots), but Breaking Benjamin's sound was good enough from the start that they've got a long way to go before wearing it out, I think.<br /><br />I always find myself amused by the bands I get listed as \\"similar artists\\" when a BB song comes up on last.fm, or the \\"buy this with...\\" box on Amazon. Calling, say, Hinder in any way similar to Breaking Benjamin makes me wonder what the guys who stick this stuff together are smoking when they do it. You could make a case that the aggressive, kinda-nu-metal guitar-based BB sound is similar to something like Three Days Grace (but, really, can anyone explain the supposed similarity between Breaking Benajmin--or, for that matter, Three Days Grace--and some sort of wannabe-alt-country act like Hinder or Three Doors Down?), but the big difference is in those lyrics I mentioned before. While Three Days Grace are off whining about failed relationships, Breaking Benjamin are giving you helpful solutions to failed relationships like offing your ex (\\"The Diary of Jane\\") or making sure she's dead before you start courting her (\\"So Cold\\", \\"Breakdown\\"). I haven't yet dug deep enough into \\"Crawl\\" to decide whether you can add \\"construct your own\\" to that list, but given the band's involvement in the recent movie Surrogates, it's probably not too much of a stretch. Another difference is that when Burnley isn't giving you novel solutions to your girlfriend problems, he's making sure you know those are the only ones that are workable. Lyrics about relationships that actually exist are, for the most part, anything from relentlessly nihilistic (Phobia's \\"You Fight Me\\") to perverse-but-not-as-bad-as-murder (\\"What Lies Beneath\\"). There is one kind of distressing exception to this rule, which comes at the very end of this disc (\\"Without You\\"). I call it \\"distressing\\" only because, well, look what happened to Staind when Aaron Lewis found himself a stable relationship. I took one listen to their most recent album (only because it was supposed to be a \\"back to the roots\\" kinda gig) and promptly ate it. That's not easy to do with a CD...<br /><br />In any case, if you're already a Breaking Benjamin fan, you probably don't need my recommendation to go out and buy this thing, preferably today (it gets released to the general public on the day I write this--and given what times my local Best Buys and the like open, you can probably get it about eight minutes from when I'm writing these words, at 9:52AM). It's just as good as Phobia. It may even be better. I do think that people who haven't discovered the band yet, as always, would probably do better with a less coherent album with more tracks that sound tailor-made for radio play (which could be either We Are Not Alone or Phobia, both are wonderful), but make Dear Agony your second Breaking Benjamin purchase. Once again, just as in 2004 and 2006, Breaking Benjamin will probably not top my albums of the year list (it's gonna be hard to get by Merzbow's incredible Don't Steal My Goat album), but it would take some of my favorite bands releasing the best albums of their career to knock it out of the top three. **** ½the only ones that are workable.

0786868724|5.0|I am in LOVE with HAVE A LITTLE FAITH!  I've been a fan of Mitch Albom's books since TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE, and have been anticipating this - his first non-fiction book - since its release.      In a nutshell, Albom profiles two people:  a rabbi who he has been asked to write a eulogy for, and an inner-city convict turned pastor.  Two very different worlds, two very different religions, but one strongly shared similarity :  FAITH.      This book REALLY made me think about my OWN spirituality and what faith means to me these days.  The question Albom asks is:  \\"what if faith wasn't what divided us, but what brought us together?\\"  In a world where SOOO many wars are started in the name of religion and holier-than-thou attitudes prevail amongst so many different groups, it seems like all of our problems would be solved if only we could just say, \\"Hey, I have faith, you have faith...however we get there doesn't matter.  What matters is that we both BELIEVE.\\"  Doing good for others is sometimes the greatest way to experience pure joy.  If we all gave a little more of ourselves unselfishly, I do believe that peace would prevail.      HAVE A LITTLE FAITH is REALLY a good read.  Beyond the story and the characters (which in true Albom style, jump off of the page and into your heart), the message is deep.  It's a book that will stay with you for quite awhile.  You'll want to highlight parts and dog-ear pages like I did. It's found a home next to my other perennial favorites like THE FOUR AGREEMENTS, THE ART OF HAPPINESS and THE GAME OF LIFE.  It's very, very good.
0385504225|3.0|Much has been said about Dan Brown's failings as a writer, and this book will not help his image there at all. But, he shows he can still put together an interesting novel with fascinating historical tidbits and obscure but all-to-real science.    The Lost Symbol succeeds as a sequel to the Da Vinci Code. I still hold that Angels & Demons was his best work involving his protagonist, Robert Langdon. If you enjoyed those works, you'll enjoy this one. But understand that his writing is no better (how many times can you use the word esoteric in a novel), utilizing the same gimmicky short-chapters and obtrusive italics. Brown would benefit from a partnership with a good writer like Douglas Preston- let Brown do the research and outline a plot, then let Preston create the narrative. To put it another way- the best Star Wars movies weren't directed by George Lucas, though he is clearly the genius behind the stories.    Still, for what it is, Brown makes it work. All the components are there- obscure historical facts, a healthy dose of science vs religion, and a bigger-than-life revelation, though one not quite as explosive as the DaVinci Code's. Brown telegraphs his premise very early, and I figured out the big A-HA reveal well before he spelled it out.    To sum up, if you like Dan Brown and stories similar to the Da Vinci Code, you'll like this book well enough.
0385504225|1.0|I first read the DaVinci Code and thought it was a decent beach reading book ala John Grisham. After reading Angels and Demons and now The Lost Symbol, I found out they are all the same book with slight variations. The Lost Symbol was the poorest of the lot. I couldn't wait for chapters to end; fist because i thought I would get some questions answered and then just to move on.    Dan Brown has obviously become a legend in his own mind. For the life of me I don't understand how anyone could give any book more than 2 stars. This one didn't rate that. Like James Patterson and Robert Ludlum, I will not waste my time reading another Dan Brown book.
0061841935|5.0|I have vague memories of Steve Allen and Jack Parr. Mostly Johnny Carson entertained me. Johnny was warm and funny and enjoyed his guests. His was quick and bright and funny.

That is why I wanted to hear him read his words; to see if I was right. I am so I was!<br /><br />No one's life is easy, surely not his, but he makes no apologies for it...it is what it is. He said something like, his son and he grow out of their mistakes. Isn't that lovely? His explanation of what addition was/is like for him is probably one of the best I have heard.<br /><br />Oh, don't doubt it, he is really glad to be an American.<br /><br />Is it a \\"tell all\\" book?<br /><br />Yes, about himself. No about others, he changes the names of people where he feels appropriate.<br /><br />Who is this for?<br /><br />If you are listening to it, those who like the Scottish burr. People who like memoirs. People who like a bit of a giggle. People that like him on TV and want to know more about the man; like did you know he wrote a novel before this book?<br /><br />Oh,all of you who like a good story told in the first person, read the book! For you vampire lovers, he likes them and likes to play them.<br /><br />What more can I say?

B001CISHU4|5.0|Amon Amarth is one of the best representations of Asatru world view and religion. They play a religious type of music motivated by pagan religion Asatru. Like Johann Sebastian Bach, who was moved by Christianity, Amon Amarth create timeless music under the influence of Asatru. An organization of Asatru people, called Asatru Folk Assembly, says that Asatru is an expression of the native, pre-Christian spirituality of Europe. More specifically, it is the way by which the Germanic peoples have traditionally related to the Divine and to the world around them. Asatru people do not need salvation. All they need is the freedom to face their destiny with courage and honor. Asatru believes are connected to their ancestors. The ancestors are a part of Asatru people living now. Among important principles, Asatru honor the Holy Powers under the names given them by their Germanic/Norse ancestors. Listen to Amon Amarth and get in touch with your ancestors!

Like Julie Reed, I started with leek and potato soup and worked my way through the book from there (no, I haven't cooked all the recipes, and no, I didn't try to do all of them in one year).    What I love about this cookbook is that if you learn a technique, it opens up all sorts of recipes to you and is organized that way.   So if you learn to make a quiche, you can make a tarte.  If you learn to make mayonnaise, you can make hollandaise.  And so on.  With the illustrations and the detail provided in the master recipes, it would be hard to go wrong.    Lastly, her recipes have my favorite recipe words in them \\"Can be made ahead to this point.\\"  Those words are every cook's salvation!

When Johnny Cash heard the demo for \\"Sunday Morning Coming Down\\" he said \\"The man's a poet, but he can't sing.\\" Kris Kristofferson certainly has a lot of charisma and stage presence, he even had a little chemistry in the love scenes with Barbra, but what he wasn't was credible. I didn't see him with her, or vice versa. I didn't see him as recognizing her talent, not that she displayed any. In the scene where he \\"discovers\\" her, the song just isn't very good. And as the white filling in a group called The Oreos, why was she the only one with an Afro?<br /><br />Later, Kris is trying to make a comeback, playing at some benefit, but he stops mid-song and has Esther (Barbra) go on instead. Of course, even though it made no sense, Kris' band, Speedway, a crude bar band, somehow knew her arrangement, had it orchestrated with strings, and followed the diva's dynamics -- from soft, barely audible beginning, to bravura ending where she flexes those vocal cords of steel! At least Richard Simmons liked it.<br /><br />I did like the scene in the studio where they recorded \\"Evergreen.\\" It was recorded live, as Barbra didn't think lip synching looked convincing in close up, and though Kris Kristofferson is nowhere near the singer that Barbra is, he makes a charming and valiant effort. I love that song, especially the part where she holds the pedal tone at the end as the chords change under her. She has credit for writing the music, and Paul Williams only has a credit as a lyricist, but I hear that she claimed she wrote the whole song. What I want to know is, who wrote those chords under the note that she is holding? The song is pretty pedestrian up to that point, but then that ending is so harmonically dramatic.<br /><br />Bottom line, the third time is definitely NOT the charm for A Star is Born, but this overblown movie is fun to watch, nevertheless, if only to cringe at 'the way we were' in the bicentennial year.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001URA5Y8 Powder Blue]] (2009) Kris Kristofferson was Randall<br />[[ASIN:B000AQDROU Trouble in Mind]] (1985) Kris Kristofferson was Hawk<br />[[ASIN:B00020HB0K Songwriter]] (1984) Kris Kristofferson was Blackie Buck<br />[[ASIN:B0000YEE1C The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With the Sea]] (1976) Kris Kristofferson was Jim<br />[[ASIN:B00001W9G0 The Way We Were (Special Edition)]] (1973) Barbra Streisand was Katie Morosky<br />[[ASIN:B00005QCTZ The Owl And The Pussycat]] (1970) Barbra Streisand was Doris<br />[[ASIN:B0006VXMLM On a Clear Day You Can See Forever]] (1970) Barbra Streisand was Daisy Gamble<br />[[ASIN:B00005O3VD Funny Girl]] (1968) Barbra Streisand was Fanny Brice<br />[[ASIN:B00000JQU9 A Star Is Born]] (1954) Judy Garland, James Mason<br />[[ASIN:B00068NVGG A Star Is Born]] (1937) Janet Gaynor, Fredric March<br /><br />BTW, Barbra is releasing a new album in a few days and I can't hardly wait to hear her do \\"In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning.\\" It is coming out on 9/29/2009.

1607961423|5.0|I wished in a way to have read this book when I was a teenager, it would have done a big difference in my life in that difficult time,<br />it is never late to go though it. It helped Me learn how to help myself  & others,  it is tremendous how much it broadens You're perspective on everything.<br />Very enlightening
159562015X|1.0|I echo many of the complaints from other reviewers including:    - you cannot buy this book used and still take the test  - one test per person per book and only ONE TIME --> forget taking the test again... esp if you were in a rush, distracted, etc.  - knowing what your strengths are is not rocket science --> all of these were no-brainers for me  - one strength didn't resonate w/ me as strongly as some of the ones who DIDN'T make my top 5 --> too bad I can't take the test again.  - there are no \\"runner ups\\"; you cannot know whether another strength listed was only off by one or two points    If you need to know your strengths or where your best assets lie, please choose any other book. This book is a scam. I wouldn't be surprised if the authors' friends are the ones rating top 5 on this review.    I won't be buying any other books from Gallup, anything associated with Strength Finder, and definitely not anything from Mr. Rath.
B002CRN7WM|5.0|I just ordered the CD and cannot wait to receive it. I watched this year's Eurovision competition and can say without reservation that the music, the lyrics, and the singing of this young artist are just beautiful. You can tell Alexander loves what he does. I enjoyed Fairytale and have listed to it many times. Cannot wait to hear the other songs. I would agree with the other reviewer that perhaps this style of music is not terribly popular in the US but that does not detract from Alexander's musical talents or the beauty of the music.
0385504225|5.0|What do you get when you cross puzzles, codes and riddles with the Freemasons, wrapped up in a very suspenseful story? Answer: The Lost Symbol. This is Dan Brown's latest book that once again features the famous Robert Langdon. Personally, I hope that all of Dan Brown's future novels feature Robert Langdon because he is one of my ultimate heroes and I always get to learn something new in each novel.     As I was reading through this novel, I immediately pictured a cast for this movie. Studying each character in the novel made me immediately think of what actor or actress should play this role. In the past I have been right when I attempted this with other novels, but here is how I envision it (not a complete list):    Robert Langdon - Tom Hanks  Warren Bellamy - Morgan Freeman  Katherine Solomon - Mimi Rogers  Peter Solomon - Dennis Quaid  Mal'akh - Vin Diesel  Inoue Sato - (This is a hard one, but I'm sure Sony can find a good one)    So, this is how I see each character. I might be right. I might be wrong but you gotta admit: This is a good line-up for The Lost Symbol. It would make me want to see the movie even if I didn't know what the story was about.    Pick up a copy and read this novel! Every chapter is a page-turner. You will be delighted, surprised, in awe, and shock once you read through this novel. It will definitely keep you wanting to read more!!! Highly Recommended
0061730327|5.0|I don't think I have ever read any book, of any genre, whether fact or fiction, whose protagonist was am compelling and likable as this one. William Kamkwamba was born in Malawi, one of the least developed places and densely populated places on earth (according to wikipedia at any rate). The story opens by describing William's early life growing up in a small town in Malawi. It is a fascinating look at a life which is completely alien to a westerner like me. William's family, like most Malawians, are subsistence farmers. They have no electricity or running water, the government is largely corrupt, and they have to deal with problems like wild animals, poor rainfall, and malaria. While in his early teens a drought hits the country. The chapters where the authors describe the slow spiral from hunger to hopelessness to desperation and death are the most poignant in the book, and show a side of the world I have thankfully sheltered from in the west.     Despite being a school dropout (his family couldn't afford tuition), William is inspired by science textbooks he borrowed from the library to try and built a windmill. However, he has no money and no equipment. Going through trash heaps and junkyards he manages to turn the most improbable of materials into a functioning windmill - old shoes, cracked PVC pipe, clothes line, etc. He slowly works on additions - things like circuit breakers and switches - to improve the windmill, and the authors are nice enough to include how he made everything in the book. As an engineer, I was fascinated by his ingenuity in managing to turn trash into treasure. By the end you can't help but want to cheer for William - born into an impoverished country, battered by external forces, with no formal high school education, he has poured all his energy and heart into managing to create something that we westerners take for granted every day.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|Their last album wasn't their best, but it was full of radio friendly songs that stations could play and build the exposure for the band.  That's great for these guys, as they truly deserve every ounce of fame they achieve.  But for this album, you can really tell they have matured lyrically and musically from their previous albums.  Not one song on this album is similar to another, as was the case on previous albums.  There's a great deal of variety in all the songs and you can tell this band is becoming something great.    1) Fade Away (9/10) - This song is a GREAT way to start off the album.  I can almost guarantee that this song will be a single.    2) I Will Not Bow (9/10) - This song is the first single off the album, and it really shows how the band has matured in one song.  From the catchy riff, to the scream of \\"Fall\\" throughout the song, to the highs and lows throughout the chorus and verses, you can really see how Ben is being more confident in his voice.    3) Crawl (9/10) - This song really stood out to me the first time I heard it due to the growls in the chorus.  It's such a dark song, and could be one of my favorites of the record.    4) Give Me A Sign (10/10) - I've been a Breaking Benjamin fan since the \\"Saturate\\" days, and I've honestly never liked one of their slow songs that much - but this song is different.  The first time I heard this song, I was in the car with my girlfriend and we couldn't help but smile at this song.  It shows a different side to a love song, and many people I've talked to have said this is their favorite song on the album.    5) Hopeless (8/10) - Again, a song with some growling.  This song is really heavy and shows the new direction that I believe the band is going.  Heavy music, Heavy lyrics, Growls = sweeeet!    6) What Lies Beneathe (6/10) - Not a song that I really liked from the start, but has grown on me since that first listening. I just really don't think it's that catchy.    7) Anthem of the Angels (7/10) - Onceagain, not that catchy of a song, but it's something different from the band.    8) Lights Out (9/10) - Very catchy guitars with a simple beat throughout.  Not to mention the anger in Ben's voice you can hear at certain points.    9) Dear Agony (8/10) - The album's title track, of course.  Another song that is going to take some listening to before I learn to love it.    10) Into The Nothing (9/10) - I love how this song is structured and the chorus is one of my favorites from the band.  It sounds like a very Saturate-esque type of song also.    11) Without You (8/10) - Not a slow song, but a \\"love song\\" as I like to put it. This one is quite upbeat, which is why I like it.  Overall, it's a great way to end the album.
0061537969|5.0|Without a doubt, one of the best books ever.  If you are a dog lover, race fan, people person or just love a good book, The Art Of Racing In The Rain is for you!  If it does not become a classic, I will be shocked.  All the positive reviews are right on plus some.<br />Buy it, read it and pass it along.  You will be doing yourself and someone a favor.  Go Enzo!
B002C6K7NA|5.0|Aside from archival CDs featuring the late Ronnie Van Zant on lead vocals, GOD & GUNS is one of Lynyrd Skynyrd's best later albums. All of the songs are top-notch, with a hard rock edge missing from their work since the early days. The song \\"Southern Ways\\" and one or two others sound like the band has been listening to BEST OF THE OUTLAWS: GREEN GRASS AND HIGH TIDES for a while, whereas the rest sound like a Southern version of Montrose's first album. Many of the selections here are about faith, survival, and standing up for what you believe in. The fact that the current members have supported efforts to free Americans jailed in Iran and North Korea on false charges, as well as the right of police to use deadly force to rescue two girls kidnapped in California in 2002, makes GOD & GUNS an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B002GZQYMA|5.0|I have been a fan of the band since the very beginning, their song writing and compositions are simply wonderful! Muse are the refreshment in the current music world, filled with useless pop hits made only for money. Bands like that are really rare these days.<br />Now, let me focus on the limited edition. I bought it mainly because it was a really good deal with affordable price, having in mind that it comes with the CD, a DVD and a booklet! The packaging is also great, instead of a regular plastic CD case, this edition is packed in a carton box, and a paper booklet. I will not focus too much on the music, because everyone tend to be subjective when it comes to that. I will just say that I adore this album, and I've only listened to it once. It's different from their previous work, but the progressive rock influence is still there, only filled with a bit of classical and electronic sauce! Speaking of classical, Matt Bellamy is a brilliant compositor, Exogenesis three part Symphony is a masterpiece.<br />I give this album 5 star rating and I cannot wait to see what's next for my favorite band!
B001QXE0OC|5.0|Great Album!!!!!  I have several favorite tracks.  I think some of the songs are better than what I hear on the radio, and I also think the Pilot cover (not on this CD) sounds better - I thought I liked the original, but compared to Selena's version the original sounds flat.  Get this CD! Also, the lyrics are included in the cover booklet, and the thank you's are a real blessing :)  God bless.
0385504225|2.0|I enjoyed The DaVinci Code and had high expectations for Lost Symbol.  We were led on a thrill packed ride through Washington DC, which was a great adventure worthy of a successor to DaVinci Code.  The plot however was a major let down, leaving a very hollow feeling after reading the book.    The (theatrically bad) villain is planning to commit some terrible deed, could this be a WMD, the opening of a portal to some other dimension, a plague of alien creatures........... no wait - he's going to release a Discovery Channel video about Freemasons.
B00006IU73|5.0|Public radio disgusts me. How can these guys have 12 albums out and I don't hear about them until I get XM? This is some of the best music I've heard in a long time.
1440469563|4.0|Being a Patrick O'Brian fan and knowing he was an admirer of Jane Austen, I gave her a try a few years ago with Pride and Prejudice and found it stunningly good and unforgettable. Sense and Sensibility is my second Austen novel and I hoped for an equally good performance. I would not have had the patience to get very far with Jane Austen earlier in my life. Austen can be stilted, wordy (to say the least), obtuse and just plain difficult to read and understand. She also leaves a lot to the imagination which although frustrating, actually adds depth and emotion. There is also a keen, many-layered understanding of people at their best, worst, and various shades of in- between, along with the associated foibles.  Sense and Sensibility is a great story that, at times, had me rushing through many chapters to see the end result. For example, Marianne's encounter with Willoughby in London would make my top ten of dramatic literary scenes (if I were to ever compile such a list).  As Sense and Sensibility neared its end, I hoped for and expected the sort of satisfying, happy, and witty ending I enjoyed in Pride and Prejudice, but found an unsatisfying, matter of fact (but perhaps realistic)  anti-climax instead.  I feel like I am defacing something sacred, but I have to give Sense and Sensibility only 4 stars. It is well worth the time, but if one is to pick their first Jane Austen book, based on my limited experience, let it be Pride and Prejudice.  Next on my list is Emma.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This may be an animated movie, but it carries a profound message.  Although set in the future, it is an allegory for our times.  I highly recommend not only watching this with your kids, but have meaningful discussions with them afterward.   Brilliantly moving, insightful and very funny.
B000J3OTSM|4.0|channing tatum was hotttt ... the music was awesommmmme ... now that they're married ... it's still awesome to see them together.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Great production, great music, incredibly complex lyrics that match the music and flow of the songs (sometimes rivaling Nas' lyrics on Illmatic).    This is by far, still the best hip-hop album created by a woman.    I hope Lauryn really did write and produce most of the songs (just to hope she can replicate this effort later).    But regardless of whether this is mostly solo or a collaborative work, this is a great piece of art.
B000F8O35U|4.0|i loved the original story, i loved the movie as a kid, i still love it now as an adult, i have the whole collection now.
B0000029GA|5.0|This album is flawless top to bottom. The greatest rap album in history.         Lyrics flow with the music. The pace is persistent, expressing New York life as a relentlessly persistent force. The beats feels like the march of a soldier's drum.         Not only was this the first album to attempt complicated internal rhymes, but is STILL the best at it.         This album, in my opinion, is the greatest triumph of the English language, both creatively and structurally. Better than Shakespeare.
0375413405|5.0|Julia Child is brilliant in the layout of this fabulous cookbook. The sidenotes suggesting drinks and accompanying side dishes with each recipe is marvelous. If I'd never known what a wisk or oven-proof dish was, I could place a meal before friends and family that would bring a round of applause after the first taste.  Thank you Julie-Julia for such a reveal in your movie to inspire women to rediscover the joy of toiling in the kitchen again.
B000M06SU4|5.0|When I saw they had produced a \\"new\\" Beatles album on vinyl I had to get one.    The sound is fantastic and I like the way some of the tracks have been redone.    I would recommend it to anyone who is into vinyl like I am and likes The Beatles like I do!
0385504225|3.0|Dan Brown knows how to keep the suspense, and push each scene short and keep them from going stale.   However, he repeats the same phrases quite endlessly, making the book feel painfully squeezed out of him, rather than enthusiastically.   There are many times when Prof Langdon's thoughts and speech are rehashing same pattern and phrases ad nauseum.  I probably will look forward to his next book, but my anticipation will be very much tempered, my recommendation to others more muted.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|metallica should sit down and listen...this is how you do it. Really, not much else to add, Endgame may just be an instant speedmetal classic. All of this in late 2009, can you believe it?
0545123267|3.0|2 Point of Views of Grace and Sam. Each Chapter has Celsius for the temperature.<br />Grace has been in love with a wolf for 6 years. She was bitten at 11 years old. She was been watching the woods. Wolf gets shot and turns into Sam. Girl tries to save Sam(wolf).<br />I think this book has the Twilight effect. Parents are hardly around the book. Girl is independent and makes dinner all the times for the family. They are off doing arty stuff. Girl can sneak a boy into the bedroom and parents are clueless. There was some serious PDA and sexual activity in her bedroom.<br />Good-- scene was the bathtub. This is an important scene to the book and character of Sam. Also the relationship between Grace and Sam seemed normal as it could be with him being a werewolf.<br />Bad --Neglectful parents--most disturbing scene Grace was left in a car and almost died. There was no mention of anything happening to the Parents.<br />Would I let my daughter read this book?? Maybe when she is much older and we would discuss this book.<br />It was good to see the werewolf side and that romance. It does leave the door open for another book. I might read the next book.
1400063515|5.0|Nassim Nicholas Taleb's The Black Swan must not be read unless you're prepared to open your mind for interaction.  I have always read everything automotive that I could get my hands on... great for hosting car talk shows, but very tunneling.    NNT's book was my first book purchase outside my comfort zone / wish I remembered how it came my way.  Regardless, I found the book difficult to read (for me) requiring full and complete dedication to each page.  Most books are made up of sentences that form paragraphs, but The Black Swan is comprised of story-telling-sentences within paragraphs.    I have already started my second reading in hopes to better grasp NNT's full meaning.  I highly recommended this book for those who think they already know what they know.
B002POMLHY|2.0|I've been a Breaking Benjamin fan since Saturate, and have really appreciated their original styling, which progressed from CD to CD with a unique sound each time. I'm not sure why every other review is a rave, giving it a 'flawless 5 stars'. This is far from the case.    Every song sounds the exact same. It's like they used the same pattern of music and lyrics to rehash the same idea 11 times. The vocabulary used can't exceed more than 400 words, and most are basic and repeat in the songs. (The words 'goodbye' and 'eyes' are BEYOND common). The theme of almost every song seems to revolve around Ben (or whoever you want to picture telling the story) either saving himself from someone else who is their biggest problem in life, or saving that other person from themselves. There is no variety, it's all shallow angst, and whilst that worked for a lot of their songs, it's starting to feel like another AC/DC or Metallica in the sense that they'll be around for a while, doing the same thing for 20 years.    I expected this. When I first heard the single 'I Will Not Bow' on the radio, I thought to myself 'Yeah, this sounds like anything off of Phobia. Sure, it's a solid song, but absolutely nothing original. But what else is new?' I hoped the CD would mix it up, but my fears were confirmed. And I know that despite this, hundreds of thousands of copies will be sold, and thousands of people will continue to write 'rave reviews'. For all those people, I'm glad you're OK with patterning and consistency. But here is where I sadly must depart from Breaking Benjamin, only to remember their 'better days'.    Again, this is only my opinion. I'm certain a lot of people will really appreciate this CD. Just don't expect anything spectacular.

B0014Z4OQG|4.0|You know why I liked this movie?<br /><br />It starts out in New York City.  A bunch of spoiled rich kids are having relationship problems.  After about five minutes, you weary of their woes and begin to wish something, anything, would happen to shatter their idiotic lives.  Heck, wouldn't it be hilarious if right then a monster appeared and began to eat the whole lot of them?<br /><br />Right at that point a monster appears and begins to eat the whole lot of them!
B001AX9DT0|5.0|Ray was suggested by Amazon as a possible choice while I was looking for Joe Purdy cd's. I was totally blown away! I love Joe Purdy, but Ray's voice is definetely the better of the two. He reminds me of a cross between Woody Guthrie, Van Morrison and Joe Cocker!!!!!! Go figure. Check him out just to verify that for yourself! While I was trying to decide if I wanted to purchase this cd, my husband passed the library doors and poked his head in to ask who I was listening to. Very unusual for him to notice the music. I asked why and he said, \\"get it\\"! He is a big fan of Joe Cocker and Van Morrison both, so that makes sense. I spent the better part of August entertaining guests on our screened in deck with this cd playing. Everyone seems to be as impressed as I am. Good steaks and BB-Q and wine with Ray playing for us in the background. It doesn't get much better than this! Don't know where he's from or where he's going, but he fits right in with our easy going, grass roots, Kansas life style! I feel safe in saying you will love this cd as much as I do.
B0028T6XXY|5.0|Just got home from a late night of work and finished a quick dinner. Took a quick shower and ripped open the CD. Listened to the first few tracks and the music is so relaxing and refreshing. Now, at 1:15 in the morning, I find myself pouring a glass of chilled chardonnay. That's how good this album is. Love the music and Michael's musical style. This is the second album I own of his. Very nice interpretation of some old classics (Lost, Me and Mrs. Jones). I'm very happy I purchased this album. If you like to relax and sip wine while listening to some good tasteful tunes, this CD is for you.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite westerns, and now that it is on Blue-ray it is even better.  The moment i got it, I sent the kids to their mom's house and I watched it straight through.  Little faster with out comercial intuptions.
0307236722|5.0|I've owned this book for a bit over a year, and it has quickly become one of my favorite baking books (Believe me, I own quite a few). The recipes run the gamut from simple breakfast muffins to rustic cobblers to elegant napoleons. There is even a recipe for a three-tiered wedding cake! Some recipes are quick and easy, while others tend to be very complex and involved, offering options for both the novice and advanced home baker, and allowing the user to grow with the book, trying more difficult recipes as one's skills expand. However, even the most complex of the recipes are laid out and explained clearly. In addition, there are beautiful photos on nearly every page (and most pages have more than one!), showing both finished baked goods and illustrating techniques.<br /><br />I've made quite a few of the recipes in this book and thought I'd share a few of my favorites. There are four cupcake recipes in this book, of which I've tried three. The Maple-Walnut Cupcakes with Maple Buttercream (p. 164) are really excellent. Make more candied walnuts than cupcakes - you'll just want to grab a handful and munch on them while you're garnishing. The Carrot-Ginger Cupcakes (p. 166) were really light and fluffy, although they very mild and not all that carrot cake-y, so that may not be to everyone's taste. But the instructions for making marzipan carrots (with photos!) make them so easy. I've made the One-Bowl Chocolate Cake on p. 168 as both cupcakes and a layer cake, and it's a great go-to basic chocolate cake recipe. The Marble Cake with White Chocolate Glaze (p. 65) is super easy yet impressive - the perfect thing to have with coffee when a friend stops over.<br /><br />Martha's Classic Apple Pie recipe (p. 228) is simple and excellent, and her Pate Brisee (p. 224) is my go-to recipe for pie dough - it works every time. The Tarte Tatin (p. 265) is about as easy as a \\"company\\" dessert can get, looking both rustic and fancy at the same time (and it tastes amazing - like candied apples on pie crust; how could you go wrong?) I've made the Fruit Curd Tartlets (p. 258) with both lemon and lime curd (both on p. 390), and while the tartlet molds I used were really small (about 1\\" - don't do it to yourself!!!) and a huge pain in my [...], everyone loved them and they were gone in a flash.<br /><br />This book makes even difficult, pastry chef-caliber techniques like laminated doughs accessible. I made the from-scratch Puff Pastry on p. 359, and while it took the better part of a day and used a crapload of butter, the difference from frozen, pre-packaged puff pastry was so amazing that I don't ever want to buy it again. I also tried my hand at the Danish Dough (p. 334),  and made the Prune Pinwheels and Apricot Bow Ties (p. 336 & 338, respectively). The absolute winner of the book, though, is the Chocolate Babka on p. 352. Coming from a Russian/Polish Jewish background, I've eaten a lot of babkas, but this one was PERFECT. Loaded with chocolate, covered in streusel.... you need to try it. Granted, the recipe calls for 2 rises and with several different components it takes a bit of time to complete, but it also makes three loaves and they freeze beautifully. Eat one, store the other two in the freezer, and you'll have something perfect to bring to a potluck or housewarming at a moment's notice.

Every term you need to know is defined at the beginning of the book, giving the dictionary meaning AND the how-to.

B0015ABRE2|4.0|(disclaimer:I only watch tv shows on DVD, so I have no idea how season 4 is progressing)I have to admit I didn't see how the writers were going to keep up the suspense after season 2 but they pulled it off fairly well with season 3. Although not as claustrophobic or tense as seasons 1 and 2 ( no ice truck killer/backstory or FBI closing in) season 3 sees Dexter continuing to explore his nascent efforts to connect with 'normal' people. He makes a new friend, he stays in a relationship with Rita, he feels emotions while dealing with an old family friend who is dying. While you won't be pulling all nighters racing through the episodes  to find out what happens next (seasons 1 and 2, I miss you) season 3 does just fine. My only complaint is the scarcity of special features on the dvd set. I almost didn't buy these 3 sets because of the lack of supplemental material. If I didn't feel compelled to support programming I love with my money, I would have been content to just watch the episodes on my computer. A word to the studio: if you want people to buy the DVD, you need to give them something they can't get on tv or the computer.
B002FOQXZK|5.0|With so much hiphop out there just a retread of last year or 30 years ago, Kid Cudi delivers a unique voice with unique production.  It's a winner.  Day N Nite was remixed into a great dance track, but this album isn't a collection of Usher-style dance hits and ballads, its something completely different.  Someone mentioned that this album is like Dark Side of the Moon for hiphop and that's probably the best description you'll find.  It's eclectic and has a lot of different producers each with a distinctive sound.  Great collaborations!
0684830485|5.0|Covering a period of just under four days,this riveting story tells of a doomed offensive against the facists in the Spanish civil war. Robert Jordan seeks the help of partizans in the mountains to blow a bridge. Amongst them is Maria...<br />  What can be said of this great work that hasn't been said a million times? It is a fantastic thriller,a close account of the Spanish war and culture,of love, of death,of political stupidities....<br />  But for me,this is the book that finally tuned me into Hemingways style and power-his laconic but highly descriptive prose that press all the right buttons in the imagination;the use of 'Thee' and 'Thou' to properly give the feel of the peasants dialect;the way he builds up complex characters with just the briefest of story lines,even the way Robert Jordan is always refered to as Robert Jordan seems to add to his character.Its wonderful and each chapter excites and adds.<br />  When I was about 11 or 12 I foolishly tried to take on 'Farewell to Arms' and simply didn't have the reading ability then to take aboard Hemingways style (although I see now how many imitators it has) This prejudiced me against him. I didn't go overboard with the 'easier' 'Old Man and the Sea' but warmed a bit after reading 'Men Without Women' and thought I'd give Hemingway another go some time and am so glad I did with this one.<br />  The complexities of this book are reflected in Hemingways own life;the preoccupation with death and suicide,of beauty and brutality.<br />  A great book; a book in the true sense of the word.Persist with Hemingway as when you 'get' him the experience is truly wonderful.
B002QNGKGW|1.0|I hope that this is edited only because this first episode is free. If not can you edit out all the blood and violence also. Then I can watch it while eating dinner, that would be great!    P.S.  I don't like some of the actors, so can you edit them out also, Thanks!
B001SF8G1Q|5.0|I agree strongly with the positive comments on the sound of this remaster. Although New Morning was well-received at the time and has generally been considered a strong effort by the fans, the remaster was somehow skipped over when the SACD remasters came out in 03. That was a crime, because the old CD version was one of the worst in the catalogue, muddy, muddled, and almost unlistenable (the original vinyl was no great shakes either). Well guess what, this sounds as good as any of the SACDs, even though it is standard 16 bit redbook. The great music is like bird released from its cage, and now it really sings.
0143036424|5.0|While I am an avid mystery reader, I am not a frequent reviewer only focusing on books that I want to highlight.  This is an unusual situation as I did not read this book but rather listened to an unabridged version on Audible.    This is a superb novel that transports me (city born and bred) to a place and people I am totally unfamiliar with.  While I am a hardened mystery/thriller, I must admit that the last hour of the audio brought tears to my eyes.[[ASIN:0143036424 The Cold Dish]]
0312380852|5.0|This is the best bead micromacrame book I have seen so far. This is for two reasons: First, Annika uses lots of beads in her designs. Other books just throw in a few as accents. Second, the book has lavish color photos throughout, with every step shown visually so you don't have to guess what each step means. I have made two of the projects in the book and was very pleased with the results!
0312427646|4.0|A stylish and witty literary conceit that is ultimately as wispy, ephemeral and sweet as cotton candy.  The title is certainly an allusion to Virginia Woolf's collection of essays from 1925 (Elizabeth II being born in 1926, less than a year after its publication -- though Woolf can be considered a common reader no more than the Queen).<br /><br />The happens to follow her ever present clutch of Corgis into a mobile library that happens to visit the palace grounds.  Good form compels her to check out a book.  She also comes into contact with a gay kitchen boy who becomes her early guide into all varieties of literature.  Subsequently the Queen discovers that, of course, the palace has its own library.  Bennett's comedic narrative of the development of this new found passion for reading (despite the disapproval of the Prince, courtiers, and the Prime Minister), and the empowerment and confidence it brings to the Queen personally, to her judgment, and to her \\"duty\\" is the central theme of the book.<br /><br />Bennett's ultimately goal, and far more serious one of course, is to show how literature humanizes the reader (as the Queen says in the book, \\"one must take the time\\"), as well as the subversive nature of independent thought, and (certainly self-servingly) leads to writing as the ultimate exercise of the mind.
B002Q63JEU|5.0|Great Album - \\"All I Wanted\\" is the best song I have heard in years - she is hitting some crazy notes - I hope her vocal chords can handle it. \\"Misguided Ghosts\\" is a beautiful song with a nice message. Some songs have a Jimmy Eat World sound probably due to the fact that they toured with them for a while. If you like Paramore you will love this Album. At a price of $3.99 this is a frickin steal!!!
B0029LHW4U|5.0|At first I wasn't too sure of the album.  I was like everyone else worried about it without Layne.  But out of respect to one of my favorite bands I knew I had to give it a fair chance.  And with all the \\"crap rock\\" that's out now days it's rare when you get a album where every song is good.  Most of the time you get one or two good tracks and the rest is filler crap.  Not with this album.  It's great from the first to the last song.      And to anyone out there who isn't giving it a fair listen without Layne.  I too was like you.  But this is AIC.  The band didn't drift from what got them here.  It's a matter of opinion and of a open mind.  You can cry how it can't be good cause Layne is no longer with us.  Or you can open your minds, open your ears and hear the fine music the rest of the members of AIC recorded for us.  Cause in the end... isn't that what it's truly about.  The music?
B001N18HOQ|4.0|pearl jam,s [ten] maybe one of their best albums ever.this is the album that launched pearl jam,s carreer.this new remaster sounds great and the bonus cd is cool with the bonus cuts.when this album was released in 1991 it soon became a huge hit and pearl jam became one of the most notable of the seattle bands along with nirvana and queensryche.for me the best cuts are;once,even flow,black,jeremy,release,oceans and alive!!if you are a pearl jam fan grab this!!
B000FJGWBC|4.0|I've to say I bought this purely to look at Ms Jessica Alba.  Yes, she is gorgeous, isn't she?  I discovered that the movie isn't too bad either.  The plot is average, but the action (esp the underwater stuffs) was good even for a non-diver like myself.      The picture quality of this Bluray is very nice... the water, the sea, etc, all showed beautifully in Bluray.    Worth a buy.
B0020TS5JM|5.0|Must have movie if you are a Scifi fan or a Fan of all things Blood eagle!!! Great actors top quality speciel effects, truly with getting on blu Ray.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Well, color me disappointed.<br /><br />It's not a \\"worse\\" book in terms of action or dialogue than The DaVinci Code or Angels & Demons.  in fact, it's very similar to them in terms of pace and progression.<br /><br />However, it's just not very interesting.<br /><br />The \\"grave threat\\" that Langdon faces isn't very grave.  The hidden mystery just isn't on par with the other two Langdon novels either.  While i found myself spellbound by the overall plot of the other two threats facing Langdon, I found myself thinking \\"So what?\\" about this one.<br /><br />I think maybe the Freemasons aren't as mysterious and interesting, nor are they as dark and ominous and the Templars or Illuminati would be.  More importantly, the peculiarities of Washington D.C. architecture, which Brown lectures on throughout the book, isn't as esoteric and surprising as the ideas postulated in the previous Langdon adventures.<br /><br />In short, I feel like \\"we've all heard this before.\\"  Where before, Brown was postulating some new and interesting historical mysteries, I feel like he's moved into the Wal-Mart version.  This doesn't seem any better written or more engaging than the host of Dan Brown copy-cat books that have been released in the past 5 years.  It's as good as most of them, but lacks the feelings of depth and \\"power\\" of the previous offerings.  In short, I doubt anyone really cares about the great quest he has sent Robert Langdon on this time.  It's neither believable nor suprising, which were the hallmarks of Brown's previous two Langdon books.  Certainly, it's not worth the hardcover price. Luckily the Kindle price is only $9.99, which suits it just fine.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Brandon Sanderson does a wonderful job in this novel of creating a unique world and a unique \\"magical\\" system in which to fashion his tale of intrigue and heroic action. Reading this book, I'm reminded of the kind of awe I had the first time I saw \\"The Matrix.\\" His allomantic battle sequences are without a doubt the most fun and intense I've read in a long time. His characterizations are perhaps imperfect, but the twists and turns of the plot more than make up for it. I highly recommend this book.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|Absolutely AMAZING!!!! I can't stop listening to the entire album over and over! If you're a big fan of Breaking Benjamin like I am, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. I love the whole cd, but a personal favourite is track 6 \\"What Lies beneath\\".    Once again Breaking Benjamin fails to disappoint! I'll be rockin' out to this cd for a very long time!
0767903862|3.0|I just returned from a three-week jaunt through Australia and this book makes a very nice companion for the journey. It is layered with  facts, anecdotes, and historical tidbits about the country and its teeming flora and fauna. I love the way Bryson presents it all ....his style is so effortless and casual that it reads like a conversation instead of a lecture.  For this element of the book, I give 5 stars.  Contained within are some fascinating and amusing stories about Australia's intriguing and unlikely history, its natural beauty, contrasting landscape and ecology. I tore through these paragraphs and pages with gusto....    ....but filling the gap between these colorful anecdotes and tidbits are the stories of Bill's \\"adventure\\" in exploring, experiencing, and writing.  These areas of the book are much less compelling.  While some of the stories are particularly poignant and others  are quite often amusing, they can be boring, seem like filler, and on one or two occasions (especially around Darwin), downright condescending and mean-spirited.  While sarcasm and snark have become pervasive throughout popular media, they seem out of place here, and one gets the impression that Bryson can be, on occasion--how do I say this kindly--a bit of a jerk. Even when the locals seem to deserve it, I feel he goes too far in chastising them simply to show that he can write a witty and delicious put-down.     Overall, I would recommend this book for anyone travelling to Australia or simply interested in reading an interesting account of its history....the balance of narrative vs. content is a bit off as I mentioned, just breeze through the superfluous parts and concentrate on the superbly satisfying quick history lessons.
0385504225|4.0|If a good read is something that makes you turn the pages, want to keep reading the book, look up items on Google (Noetic Science for me), and make you feel for the characters, then Lost Symbol is a good book!    Will it be considered \\"historically literary significant\\"?  No.  But neither was Da Vinci Code or any other Brown book.  But were they entertaining, even formulaic as some others have mentioned?  Sure, but that is what makes the book a good read and entertaining enough to imagine a movie being made out of it.      I still like Angels and Demons better than both Lost Symbol and Da Vinci Code, but this one was difficult enough to put down and the plot intriguing.  I too thought of the National Treasure movie (first one) as I read it, but this was deeper and more interesting.    If you like mid-50's symbologists, adventure, mystery, codes, and ultimately resolution, with a couple twists and turns along the way, then this book is for you.      Thanks Dan for another enjoyable read!
1416550542|5.0|From the moment I picked up this book...I was hooked...The characters are so well written...The plot moves seamlessly...If you read The House at Riverton by this author...you will love this as much or more.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Do not miss this series! Alan Ball and Charlaine Harris are both so talented individually - as a team, they are simply the best!
B001HN69AE|1.0|movie sucked bigg time!!!! trust me dont buy this its a waste of money and time!!! i tell it like it is.
0385341008|5.0|I have never read a book that the story is derived just from letters between the characters.  It was fun, poignant and a quick read.  I loved it!
B0021L8UVC|4.0|This is not a film for those unaccustomed to nor interested in paying close attention to detail. I should also think it less than a fun time for those unfamiliar with the basics in classical sci-fi literature or the history of science, either as read or gleaned from other sci-fi films. But for those so prepared and so open, be ready for the surprise treat of the end-of-summer fantasy film offerings. This film is dark (in at least two senses), tense, and tension- building, and as entertaining as it is unexpected in a season that has also given us the superb and timely \\"District 9\\". Pandorum is a feast for the philosophical and a vertical roller-coaster ride for the connoiseur of inventive camera work and break-neck cinematic direction. (My only demurer is that some of the camera work is too \\"inventive\\" for dramatic clarity and some of the direction too \\"breakneck\\" to effect the desired continued companionship of the audience.  I saw the film in a New York theater full of kids (under 30's) on a Saturday night, late; and after the first fifteen minutes of wrapper-rattling and over-the-dialogue inane audience chit-chat and back-talk, you could have heard a pin drop throughout the rest of the film.  Nuff said?
068484267X|5.0|I love memoirs and this ranks in the my top ten. Well written with humor, pathos and charm. This books carries the reader through a heart rendering childhood in Limerick, Ireland. It ends with Frank sailing to America. Frank McCourt was an excellent author and because of this first well written entry I'll be reading Tis' and then on to Teacher Man.
B002PDGTI2|5.0|It's easy to forget just how many hits Madonna has produced through the years.  This is a great compilation of a lot of the faster dance tunes she's done.  Her music is perfect to drive to, workout to - or just reminisce to, because each song brings with it a good memory.<br /><br />Madonna RULES!
B001FB4VZS|5.0|Hi: I have been folowing the Smallville program on TV. For the eight years trying to catch every week,sometimes missing a program. I have purchased the eight yearsadding to my collection.So anytime i wish to view a certain part,I could. I really enjoy watching Smallville.
B000I0RNVG|5.0|The package came in great condition as promised with all the items described. We couldn't be any happier.
0740785508|5.0|An instant classic that really gets into the nuts and bolts of doing professional illustration work. It is a rarity among popular art instruction books that they have both basic information and very professional level information. But this book has both. Great explanations, clear prose, and lots and lots of great pictures demonstrating the principles under discussion. And of course there's lots of amazing fantasy artwork by the author which is all reproduced excellently. In that way its also a Monograph of Jim Gurney's work, as it also includes lots of his other illustration work, besides Dinotopia, including some fantasy paperback book covers and some incredible Historical Pieces done for National Geographic. All of which is deconstructed to show us his thought process while composing and designing his pictures, the building and setting up models, the use of silhouettes, chiaroscuro, and value control, using research to assist the imagination and increase creativity, and many other facets of his workflow. There's also a nice concise history of imaginative art that starts the book off, which includes the best reproductions of a Howard Pyle and Dean Cornwell picture I've seen. I purchased this book directly from the Dinotopia Store, so I got it signed by Mr. Gurney. Well worth it, learned a lot very quickly.
B001IA96Q0|2.0|Once an attractive couple, Indiana and his old belle ought to have remained in retirement and kept their offspring with a D.A. a secret.  The settings seemed too much a recycling of old themes and gimmicks.  The alien crystal skull premise was never credibly explained and the snake rope bit was almost an embarrassment.  The only interesting aspect was Cate Blanchett as a villainess, but even she wasn't enough to lift the film out of the B-ment.
0061565407|5.0|I loved the book. My husband and I listened to the CD's on a recent vacation.  Great condition, great price, fast ship. Will buy here again.
B00005RDRO|5.0|Very funny cast in a well written film. If you enjoy comedy this is your movie.
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|Knowing that the movie is written by Woody Allen, there was a risk of wasting time watching it. I took the risk knowing that the nice scenery in Barcelona and Scarlett Johansson's performance would help redeem any plot defects, and I wasn't mistaken.<br />The plot is simply every man's dream of having beautiful women chasing after him, which can be easily explained, knowing that Woody Allen is the writer. What is so wonderful though is that this story reveals how delusional we ladies are for falling for stupid bad boys, who have nothing to offer (not even wit or looks) and compromising our self respect and even our simplest rights, while turning down good guys.<br /><br />Johansson's performance and her emotional conclusion at the end makes this film worth watching in order to find out that even if we make mistakes, we don't have to suffer and keep repeating the same mistake and if we can't or don't know what we want, we can at least find out what we don't want.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|is \\"ticket to ride.\\"  the MONO version blows the STEREO version out of the water.  it isn't even close.  in fact, the entire HELP cd sounds much better in MONO!    in the words of the genius PHIL SPECTOR: \\"LONG LIVE MONO!\\"    here's an analogy: MONO is to music what BLACK & WHITE is to film.  imo, the greatest movie ever made was in BLACK & WHITE--\\"CASABLANCA.\\"  imo, the greatest album ever made was in MONO----\\"REVOLVER.\\"
B002GZQYMK|2.0|I have been listening to MUSE before they went mainstream. Origin of Sym and Absolution are awesome. Black Holes and Revelations was pretty good and kind of hinted us as to what MUSE was going to become with The Resistance. Sadly I must say that they have lost the Hard Edge that they once had.<br /><br />Now for everybody this may not be bad. If you like Duran Duran and Queen then you will find alot to enjoy on this album. Great beats and great lyrics. From a Technical standpoint the album is excellent.<br /><br />Songs as powerful as Plug in Baby, Hysteria, Knights of Cydonia, Assassin, Butterflies, Supermassive Black Hole, and Take a Bow are in my opinion nowhere to be found.<br /><br />Good Songs: Resistance, United States of Eurasia, Exogenesis<br />Average Songs: Uprising, Undisclosed Desires, MK Ultra<br />Uninteresting Songs: Guiding Light, Unnatural Selection, I Belong to You<br /><br />This album really doesn't give me to much of a reason to play it. If you like MUSE or are just learning about them do yourself a favor and buy the HAARP CD/DVD combo. - GS
B0021L8UPS|2.0|Orphan is a film based on a mother who's just had a miscarriage. She already has kids but feels quite haunted by the fact that she had a miscarriage. Played by Vera Farmiga. She decides to adopt and her adoption turns out to be quite a bad decision and things start going wrong. Wait, I think I'm making it sound interesting cause the acting is really bad but what's worse is the direction. There is bad character logic and one feels the characters are acting especially Vera Farmiga who is usually one of my favourite actresses. I have seen all her films and have really liked most of them (Running Scared, The boy with stripes pajyamas, Never Forever...) I mention this because the sole reason I picked this film to watch is because of Vera Farmiga. I don't think Peter S. could have been any worse but I've seen his acting skills so again I blame the direction and the story writer.<br /><br />Please skip the Orphan cause it's nothing special. It is a really bad date film and it ruins everything. If you wish to watch something scary wait for more movies to come out and then see. Or if you're looking for more scary films from the comfort of home (DVD) then I would recommend \\"1408\\" and \\"The Strangers\\" ... the latter is under-rated.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|List me as one of the weary fans who didn't think Alice in Chains could go on without Layne.  I am and always will be a fan of Layne, and no one could ever take his place.  While William DuVall is not a Layne clone in sound, his vocals blend very well with the Chains sound!  If you are a true Chains fan, you will love this album!  To all those who are hell bent on not listening to it because it's not Layne, you are missing out on some amazing songs.  Get it a chance and you will love Black Gives Way To Blue!
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Well, there is a plot, but this book is overwritten, boring because it has these long dialogues that go on and on. Brown needs to come back to earth in his next novel. It is less creative than his previous novels.  It feels more contrived. There are some good characters, but it's hard to imagine them as they are slogging  along
B0000549B0|4.0|\\"Harvey\\" is an urban fable; a sharp and mordacious joke about the inseparable Harvey, an imaginary  six feet tall rabbit that accompanies to our distorted mind protagonist.<br /><br />This light comedy plays hard with certain social formalities. The acquired madness of his psychiatrist, the derived entanglements his weird behavior will bring us to a surrealistic set of fine vignettes.<br /><br />A caustic tale visibly permeated of theatrical feature. A real tour de force for Josephine Hull, the straight lace sister who won a very deserved Academy award for this role and of course Mr. James Stewart as Elwood.<br /><br />\\"The real disgrace of Don Quixote is not his fantasy; it's Sancho Panza\\" (Franz Kafka)
B000YI7MRM|4.0|Carefull attention to detail in lighting, scenery, costumes invoke the beautiful paintings of illumination & renaissance style.  There are scenes I replay over & over for that momentary sensation of transportation back to that magical time.  The seedier umkempt side of poverty of historic Spain is not veiled, nor are we kept from the spilled wine, and piss in the corners. The close confinement of the theater lit by reflected lanterns fans the heat made palpable between the main charachters.  Unfortunatley, the musical score is almost nonexistant-but that is the only real negative critique for the film other than the plot drags just a little.  The casting was fantastic as they searched and found the right faces that match the ethnic backgrounds of royalty and commoners.  The royals look as if they marched off the paintings on old-time tobacco containers.  Mortensen fans will love his understated musings, and slash-action.  I recommend this film for his fans, and those who love the look of artistically recreated renaissance period pieces.  Just hum your own tune where the soundtrack is lacking.
B000ICL3CO|5.0|This is simply marvelous.  You don't have this Cure album yet?  Get it NOW!  I saw the Cure perform \\"Like Cocatues\\"(sp?) and it changed my life!
044024367X|5.0|Nothing to Lose (Jack Reacher, No. 12) is every bit as thrill-packed as Reacher's #1-11.  None stop adventure is what Jack Reacher thrives on.  He takes on tremendous odds with his usual calm, philosophical attitude.  No matter what happens, Reacher can be counted on to deal with it in the most effective way.  Fans of Jack Reacher will not be disappointed in \\"Nothing to Lose.\\"  Once, again, it is proven that Reacher is The Man!
B002NPCSJG|2.0|This book was a disappointment after all the good reviews on Amazon and the 2006 Hugo Award nomination. It is a clunker, with run-of-the-mill Heinlein style social and scientific extrapolations, but none of the subtlety, and pretty poor dialog. There is so much good speculative fiction around, that I recommend you do not waste your time with this.
B002POMLHY|5.0|This album contains hard rock, great guitar, great vocals, and should be played at an infinitely loud volume whenever and wherever you may feel the necessity to ROCK!!!
B002HNA95E|5.0|When people think of MADONNA many words come to mind. Many people love her and many people hate her, but one thing everyone can agree on is MADONNA has staying power and makes some great music. From her debut over 26 years ago with her first single MADONNA has been one of the very few music artists to still maintain her popularity and remain relevant. Her music and videos always seem to serve as sign posts down the highway of my life. I could always relate a certain time and place with a particular song and or video from her. Many icons of the past have become victims of their own celebrity. They die of a drug or alcohol overdose, commit suicide, do infomercials, or end up a mess and in rehab. You have to give MADONNA credit for being able to maintain control of her life and still live a healthy lifestyle and not becoming the typical celebrity victim. MADONNA is a survivor and that's what gives her the staying power and the ability to always make us wonder what she will do next. Celebration is her third Greatest hits album and Madonna's final record for Warner Brothers.<br /><br />  In the care free 80's she made it fashionable to wear underwear on the outside and had her own unique style with her changing images which made her stand out from the rest of the MTV crowd. She used the Music Video to her advantage and created little works of art. She gave us some great songs like Everybody, Holiday, Burning Up, Lucky Star, Borderline, Like A Virgin, Material Girl, Dress You Up, Crazy For You, Into The Groove, Live To Tell, Papa Don't Preach, Open Your Heart, La Isla Bonita, Who's That Girl, Like A Prayer, Express Yourself, Cherish, and those were her hits just through the 80's and all of them are on this 2 disc CD set.<br /><br />  In the early 90's Madonna had all ready mastered the art of reinvention and video, but she pushed the envelope with her sexuality farther than anyone before or since. From being the first major artist to have a video banned on MTV, to releasing a coffee table book SEX, Madonna went full force with her sexuality and used it better than any women in show business ever had. Madonna was a survivor, and made no apologies for being who she was. In the late 90's Madonna had become a mother, and mellowed her sexuality down. She gave us some of her best music ever. Her classic 90's songs were Vogue, Justify My Love, Erotica, Secret, Take A Bow, Frozen, Ray of Light, Beautiful Stranger which are also on this CD set.<br /><br />  With the new millennium Madonna showed no signs of slowing down. She was a full time mother and still a full time businesswomen. She decided to resume touring after a 7 year absence and eventually signed a 360 degree deal with Live nation that would forever change the music industry. Her hits of the millennium were Music, Don't Tell Me, What It Feels Like For A Girl, Die Another Day, Hollywood, Hung Up, Sorry, Miles Away, Four Minutes, Celebration, and her soon to be released new single Revolver which are all also on this CD set.<br /><br />Celebration is still missing Angel, True Blue, Causing A Commotion, This Used To Be My Playground, Rain, I'll Remember, Bedtime Story, Human Nature, I want You, You'll See,  Don't Cry For Me Argentina, You Must Love Me, American Life, The Power of Goodbye, Fever, Bad Girl, Deeper and Deeper, Oh Father, and a few others. Overall this is a great collection that celebrates the most successful female recording artist in history. There will never be another Madonna, or another female artist with the impact on pop music and pop culture like she has had. This is a great collection that will stand the test of time and showcases her best music. Celebrate Madonna and relive your youth through this wonderful collection. Be sure to also pick up her Celebration DVD collection with 47 of her best Music videos. [[ASIN:B002JM1VJG Celebration: The Video Collection]]<br /><br />Disc 1<br /><br />1. Hung Up<br />2.

B002C6K7NU|5.0|LYNYRD SKYNYRD'S new release \\"God and Guns\\" is their first album of new material in over 6 years, and after listening to it in its' entirety, I now believe it just may be the first album of really \\"new\\" material to come out of a classic Rock and Roll act since the early 1980's.     Every song on this CD stands alone - I'm serious - there are no duds, no clunkers, no fillers - it is amazing from the opening riff to the closing note. Not only will it satisfy fans of the band and classic rock in general, it will also appeal to country music fans and (believe it or not) Metal fans as well. Within the confines of this CD, the boys from the Skynyrd band may well have created a new musical genre (would you call it Southern Country Metal-Lite??). No matter what you'd call it, you WILL call it GREAT MUSIC!     Possibly contributing to the different sound is the fact that they collaborated with unlikely suspects John 5 and Rob Zombie (who appear on the CD - you gotta hear \\"Floyd\\" - one of my favorite tracks, along with \\"Storm\\" and --- well, the other 10 songs! Truthfully, they are all that good!)    Lynyrd Skynyrd has also reinlisted the guitar army harmonies sound that made their sound so distinct when they first burst on the scene, and now they have incorporated a heavier sound that fits all too perfectly - even though no one (including myself) thought it would have.     What the Lynyrd Skynyrd band has done with this new album is to breathe new life into not only Classic and Southern Rock, but music in general. In an age when everything seems to sound the same, they have given us something that doesn't sound repackaged, but something fresh and exciting. So please, do yourself a favor and get this CD!     In summary, if you only buy one CD this year, make it God and Guns - you will not be sorry.

B001AQMBKA|5.0|Not much more to say than the previous reviewers, LOST season 2 is great.  I have the regular DVDs of Season 1, 3, and 4 but recently bought a PS3 so decided to buy season 2 on Blu-Ray even though I don't have an HD TV.  Unfortunately (and probably not surprisingly) the TV is just not capable of showing the improvement from regular DVD to Blu-ray.  I was able to purchase for a good price so it's no big deal, I guess I'll have to wait to really enjoy it until after I buy a new TV!

0385504225|1.0|Unfortunately any slop Dan Brown writes is guaranteed to reach the top of the bestseller list.  \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is no exception.  Brown phones it in by plagiarizing his own work, notably \\"Angels and Demons.\\" Langdon teams up with alluring female sidekick! They tear around a city while being tracked by The Man! See as they race against the clock to get to Reveal A Secret while fighting a physically freakish, comically evil antagonist! As a special added bonus, the plot twists are so absurd that the reader may be tempted to hurl the book out the window. I wish I could give it zero stars but apparently that's not an option on Amazon.
B0002EXH4A|5.0|this album brings back some cool memories. I would have to say I like the \\"cleaner\\" sound of the album, but always liked it the way it was a little better, all you need to do is turn it up loud and it sounds just fine. My mother mistakenly bought me this on cassette when i was 14 and boy did she regret it, I played the hell out of it. My favorites have always been Into the lungs of hell.... set the world afire. I love the riffs galore but when do you not get that from mustaine. If you dont have it, you should. thats about all i can say

B002G4FQAC|5.0|I started out as a casual fan of Paramore a while back. Gradually, both albums grew on me, and now they're one of my top 5 favorite bands.  I tend to think of myself as being a bit outside the usually demographic of Paramore fans, being in my late 20's, but I don't care! I've been anxiously awaiting the release of this album, and to be honest, it's one the first time in years that I've paid any attention to the 'official release date' from any band.<br /><br />Paramore has catchy, rock driven tunes with smart, well written lyrics. Hayley Williams' vocals are stunning...for such a tiny person she sure has a set of powerhouse pipes. I actually had expected this album to be a lot darker then the 1st two albums, after hearing the first single, \\"Ignorance\\" and also knowing they were going thru some personal band turmoil while recording \\"brand new eyes\\". But besides \\"Ignorance\\", and some lyrics you can tell are clearly pointed at her bandmates in other songs, there is no huge addition of somberness compared with the other albums.<br /><br />Paramore has progressed and grown, while still retaining their distinct Paramore sound. I also think the drummer, Zac Farro, was given a little more liberty in letting the drums really lead and set the tone on a few songs. There are a few quieter, pretty songs like \\"Misguided Ghosts\\" and \\"The Only Exception\\". Thinking back, I can't recall any slower jams on the other albums that are acoustic and lacking drums like \\"Misguided Ghosts\\", and that stood out for me. But don't take that the wrong way, they're both awesome songs, and show a different side of what Paramore can accomplish.<br /><br />While writing this review I struggled to find something I didn't like about this album(trying to be well rounded and not just chock full of praise!), and I'm sorry, but I couldn't come up with anything, I'm a fan, not a critic.<br /><br />On the whole, the album is amazing and I think will stand out as one of the year's best Rock/Alternative albums, just like \\"Riot!\\" did in 2007.  A must have in my opinion.<br /><br />Definitely check them out when they start touring in support of \\"brand new eyes\\". I caught them last summer opening for No Doubt, and it was an excellent show. I actually complained when the set was over that it wasn't long enough. Though I've loved No Doubt for over a decade, I was secretly there more to see Paramore for the first time and it made me excited for the upcoming fall tour.007.  A must have in my opinion.

0385504225|2.0|I was so excited when I learned Dan Brown's latest referred extensively to Noetic sciences and Lynne McTaggart's work, The Intention Experiment and The Field. It was the only reason I began reading it. Unfortunately, Mr. Brown focused far more on torture and ponderous action than the power of focused intention.     I confess to asking my husband to finish it for me as it was just another Dan Brown epic. Nothing my husband read suggested I would enjoy it. (His review: That's 5 hours I'll never get back.)     Very disappointed.
0440237688|4.0|The Giver, by Lois Lowry, was a very deep and influential book on the importance of remembrance and the gift of knowledge and freedom. The journey that Jonas took in the novel was one of great learning. Through his story, he showed the reader how important it is to cherish the freedom that we do have in this life. This book is a warning to those of all generations that remembrance is the key to keeping the freedoms of choice that people in the world enjoy. Jonas reminds us to never stop questioning the way the world is run, or we could end up living in a society like his. I think this book is extremely important for people of all ages and cultures to read because it teaches important lessons that all people should remember, lest we find ourselves color blind and memory-less in a world where all our choices are made for us.

The death of Nighteyes. Hobb took the best character in the whole series and killed him off. I'm so pissed off that I'm not even going to finish reading the rest of the Tawny Man series. A big F U to Robin Hobb for screwing up something that I thoroughly enjoyed.
0684824906|5.0|Yes, this is one of those books you should read. If you have no clue about American history and the civil war, read this! There is a lot said about this book, but as someone from Europe now living in the US, this definitely was worth every minute spent. It helps in understanding the history and the struggles in many aspects of society. Obviously this is all next to the wonderful stuff about Abe and his cabinet. You will also learn something from how he manages characters. So if you are in management, read this as lesson in how to manage people!

B002BSHXJA|5.0|[...]  Comparison of the 1987 CD Remaster, the 2009 Stereo Box Set Remaster, the 2009 Mono Box Set Remaster, and the 2009 Stereo Version on the Mono Set (which is different from the mix on the Stereo Box set). Why this song? Lots of harmonies, and we've all already heard it a million times. If anyone has a good version off of vinyl, or rock band, lemme know. I may put up another song comparison, any requests?     In my opinion, the Mono is usually best, especially when NOT listening to headphones.  Some songs, like Norwegian Wood, and the MMT stuff sound a bit better in stereo.  Also, I actually think that the original CDs aren't THAT bad.  Not as good as the new ones, but certainly not the crap that most folks make them out to be.
0385504225|2.0|Get a large cauldron and put in some of Harris' Red Dragon, some of Koontz's cold blooded killers, some of Brown's Da Vinci Code, some American history text book, a dash of Redfield's The Celestine Prophecy, mix it with Patterson's short chapter writing style and sprinkle in some Washington DC tourist maps and you have The Lost Symbol.  I found the first 4/5ths of the book fairly interesting and felt that Brown had been successful in repeating what he did in The Da Vinci Code...but then I read the last 1/5th of the book.  Initially it's a roller-coaster ride similar to Da Vinci Code and, also like the Da Vinci Code, taking place all in one day.  There are clues that Langdon follows, dead-ends, misdirections, misreading of clues and the usual chase sequences.  Fortunately I was on a trans-atlantic trip, and it did help pass the time.  What started off as a page turner, ended up being a yawner leaving the reader with \\"Why did I bother taking this trip?\\"
B001PPGAIA|3.0|**THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**<br /><br />Germaine Greer, writing in the UK Guardian, lambasted 'Australia' for sanitizing the true history of the 'Stolen Generations', the forced removal policy of 'half-caste' Aboriginal children by the Australian government. Greer mainly objects to the depiction of how the Aboriginal workers would have really been treated at a place like Faraway Downs, the 10,000+ acre ranch run by Lady Ashley. She finds it absurd that \\"a staff of no more than eight: a disloyal manager, a drunken accountant, three Aboriginal cattle hands, two Aboriginal women and a Chinese cook,\\" could run such a vast enterprise as Faraway Downs. But even worse, the Aboriginal workers should have been shown to be basically indentured servants, living in \\"humpies', filthy shelters \\"with no clean water, no sanitation and no electricity.\\" Greer is equally incensed about the idea that Lady Ashley and Hugh Jackman's 'Drover' are sympathetic characters who do not represent the way the typical Australian treated the Aboriginal population. \\"If white Australians had shown parental feeling towards mixed-race children, generations of them would not have had to be removed from Aboriginal communities by successive governments.\\" Greer misses the point about what director Baz Luhrmann was trying to do with characters such as Lady Ashley and The Drover. They represent a grafting of a modern sensibility on to the historical period in which the film takes place--a sort of projection of the way things could have been. The characters are not meant to be realistic but Luhrmann's way of atoning for the sins of the past. We see the same strategy in recent German cinema and literature (Atonement and Downfall are two examples) where there is always a set of 'good' characters to balance out the legacy of a genocidal past. Quite the contrary, Luhrmann is constantly reminding us throughout 'Australia' of the past poor treatment of the Aboriginal population. He's much more successful in low-key scenes such as when Nullah is being taunted by a Caucasian boy as he's shipped off to the Mission Island than the depiction of the stereotyped upper-crust Darwin socialites (are they all bigots?).<br /><br />Australia's 'First Act' needs a thorough fix-up. A good 20 to 30 minutes should have been cut from the beginning of the film. In addition to its length, the films' scenarists couldn't decide how to depict their Lady Ashley character. I think what they were going for was obvious: a straight-laced aristocratic type along the lines of Katherine Hepburn's determined missionary in 'The African Queen'. Instead we're offered up a childish and ditsy gal without a back story. Why should we care for Lady Ashley when we first we meet her? She's made out to be ridiculous for the first half hour (Ashley's utter goofiness reaches its apotheosis in the scene where The Drover flings her luggage all about during the fight with the bar patrons and she has a meltdown after her undergarments are spread around all over the muddy street). Luhrmann could do well to come out with a new 'Director's Cut' by shortening the opening act, making Lady Ashley less foolish, inserting a better musical score and generally making Act I less comic in tone.<br /><br />Kidman redeems herself with the break into Act 2. That's where she strikes the evil Fletcher with a whip and orders him off the ranch. From then on it's smooth sailing for Kidman who suddenly has morphed into the brave heroine she's supposed to be. Hugh Jackman does a fine job as the Drover, the outsider who aids Ashley in her quest to save her late husband's ranch. There's a nice buildup to the midpoint where Fletcher and his confederates attempt to thwart the cattle drive by setting multiple fires in the 'never never' leading up to Nullah almost being forced over the side of a cliff. Greer feels that Nullah and his grandfather, King George, especially in the scene where the cattle magically stop moving forward, are investedwith 'superhuman' powers and hence that's demeaning to Aboriginal culture. Greer wants more 'developed' characters and perhaps she should see 'Rabbit Proof Fence', a more historically accurate account of the 'Stolen Generations'. Perhaps Luhrmann is putting his Aborginal characters on a bit of pedestal but he never demeans them--quite the contrary he admires the core of that culture which emphasizes a bond with nature as opposed to the other forces which seek to destroy it (there's a great shot of King George walking impassively, searching for the lost Nullah, as the Japanese zeros bomb Darwin from overhead).<br /><br />While Luhrmann has created stock characters of Hollywood epics, the strength of 'Australia' is in the plot. In the second half of Act 2, the action builds to a dark \\"all is lost\\" moment. Luhrmann makes clever use of the year the story begins, 1939, by alluding to two famous pictures from that year--The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind. 'Over the Rainbow' figures prominently in the story as Nullah seeks some way to reach his true 'home' and the Drover feels much like an updated Clark Gable especially when he appears at the ball clean shaven and then sweeps Lady Ashley off her feet. I was not completely convinced how easily Fletcher went from being a lowly ranch hand to taking over King Carney's position (handled rather quickly in a fleeting montage) but it makes sense for him to kidnap Nullah and his grandfather after Lady Ashley rejects his demands to sell Faraway Downs.<br /><br />'Australia' has several 'all is lost' moments with the Drover believing Lady Ashley has died in the Japanese bombing along with Nullah and the kids seemingly lost on Mission Island. Luhrman ties things up nicely by having King George save Nullah from a deranged Fletcher who blames Lady Ashley for the death of his wife. Australia is a true epic which could use some judicious cutting. Purists will bemoan the anachronisms but this is still a film with its heart in the right place.rs and hence that's demeaning to Aboriginal culture.

0385504225|1.0|This is perhaps the worst. most pretentious book I have ever read. A total waste of money to read the author's silly ideas. It is only because I paid less for the Kindle edition than the hardcover that I take any solace.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Not much I can say that hasn't been said, but the moment I heard \\"All Secrets Known\\" and the sludgy guitar kicked in, I was hooked. Great lyrics, great way to slowly bring in the new singer, and the chemistry between everyone is still there. It only took one full listen and I can already say that \\"Private Hell\\" is one of my favorite AIC songs. And the more I listen to it, the more I'm beginning to think \\"Your Decision\\" is going rank right up there, too.
0385504225|1.0|Aside from the fact that this book has a number of typos, I was seriously disappointed with the whole story line. It was overly predictable and the dialogue often sounded forced. The book also abounded with pseudoscience and religious propaganda. I used to enjoy Dan Brown's books (taken at a fictional value), but this one just made me annoyed to the point that it was not enjoyable.

0385504225|3.0|By now, anyone who has read Brown's previous works knows Robert Langdon, who is back for his third round of esoteric adventure.  Ostensibly in Washington DC for a speaking engagement, he finds out that he's actually been lured there under false pretenses and that the person who supposedly invited him there has been kidnapped, and his hand has been left on the floor of the Capitol rotunda.  Langdon feels he has no choice but to get involved, and finds himself battling not only his friend's captor, but the CIA as well. Hmm.  The captor wants something that Langdon has, which will supposedly lead him to a secret pyramid in which lies the heart of the \\"Ancient Mysteries.\\" There's a catch: the CIA doesn't want Langdon to cooperate and tries to thwart him at every turn.  Langdon, accompanied by the kidnap victim's scientist sister, goes on a merry chase around DC in an effort to save his friend.  So far, nothing new here in the Dan Brown formula.     He chases around for about  the first 300 or so pages, throwing around a lot of esoteric knowledge and taking the reader on a tour of  Washington DC's \\"mystical\\" architecture, then things settle down a bit so we get some back story to help understand and to put things in perspective before things begin to heat up once more.      I'll give him this much: Brown manages to throw a lot of arcane and esoteric knowledge and theory out there (which I always find interesting even if  I know a lot of it is just too unreal) and there is a definite plot twist I didn't see coming.  The short chapters act as mini-cliffhangers that made me want to continue reading until I could hear Langdon say something along the lines of  \\"aha! this all makes sense,\\" which he does many times throughout the novel.    On the other hand, his writing is often repetitive, tedious, and clunky.  Characterization is obviously not his strong point, so frankly, I didn't care about the players involved.  But for me, the worst part was that after spending so much time on this book, I felt like I was robbed at the end.  Normally I can suspend disbelief, sit back and relax and enjoy books like this if the end pays off, making it worth the ride, but not this time.     I didn't particularly care that much for it, but this book has already sold in the millions of copies, so it all works out for the author, and there are many people who've reviewed the book and absolutely loved it.  So for that reason, I'd say that although I can't personally recommend it, people who are Dan Brown fans might want to give it a try and judge it for themselves.

It's<br />about the realization that one has not Done Enough, or Done the Right<br />Things.<br /><br />This may sound unappetizing. But one of the rare and great features of<br />Nick Hornby's writing is how he takes situations that would normally be<br />dreary, such as a serious break-up (High Fidelity) or teenage pregnancy<br />(Slam), and makes these situations hilariously funny.  His characters are<br />self-aware about themselves in some ways, but not at all in other ways.<br />These gaps in self-knowledge, and Hornby's gentle handling of them, are<br />exquisite in their subtlety and insight.<br /><br />This book reminded me: (1) Do the work you love, and (2) Strive to spend<br />time with the people who (a) love you and (b) who you love in return.<br />Which of us doesn't need this reminder, always?

And these songs from the second era of their brilliant career attest to their reign as the Greatest Rocknroll Band in the World. When the Stones are on,  no one comes close to matching their Genius. JUMP BACK is a jump forward that never  misses a beat- Jump to it Jack!
0060935464|4.0|This is a book I just never read while growing up, and when my 15-year old son began reading it in school, his interest in it pulled me in.  I checked it out of our local library but had to return it before finishing.  That led me to do an Amazon search.  Admittedly, I was disappointed I wasn't able to find it cheaper than I did, but it truly is a book worth having in our home library and is an excellent read.  I enjoyed Harper Lee's style of writing, and the setting and plot were gripping and significant.    The topics of the worth of a human being, freedom, and prejudice of various kinds, are substantially addressed in this great read, while maintaining a sense of enjoyable fiction.  It is most likely for these reasons that it has become an American classic.   If, like me, you are on the other side of high school and have yet to read To Kill a Mockingbird, I strongly recommend that you do.  At some point in life, it is a MUST READ for everyone.
B000002GFT|5.0|Now this is what I call a fantastic album. Fairport Convention's Liege & Lief is an exciting folk rock album from 1969, probably the best of the genre of folk-rock. Each track conveys a mood of \\"rolling minstrels\\" telling tall tales of kings and queens, cutthroats & peasants, and sad tales of the insane. Everyone shines on this album, from Sandy Denny's haunting vocals, to Richard Thompson's Page-like licks on the guitar, to Dave Swarbrick's shredding violin. This album is a masterpiece.<br /><br />Come All Ye gets things started with a rumbling boogie that almost has a feel of a Canned Heat song, were it not for the beautiful singing and stinging violin. Reynardine is one of the most haunting and beautiful songs I've ever heard, Sandy Denny has a warm and inviting voice that just takes you to magical places.<br /><br />The real centerpiece is the 8 minute epic Matty Groves, the English version of Shady Grove, in which a peasant sleeps with a noble wife, only to have him and the wife killed by her husband. The music fits the story, and is followed by a rousing jam with some of the best fretwork Thompson has ever comitted to tape.<br /><br />Things calm down a bit with The Deserter, but the mood still is in place. The Irish Medley is a great example of old-and-new, an electrified medley of Irish folk tunes. Tam Lin has a dark riff and a dark story. And finally, Crazy Man Michael is a sad story of a mad man killing his love. It's one of the best ballads I've heard.<br /><br />This is a fantastic album that goes from light to dark with each song. When music can move you, it's a fantastic thing, and this album moves me in many ways.
B000002J1U|5.0|Led Zeppelin III (1970) was apparently a response to the criticism that they were only capable of playing loudly.  As such, while loud tracks are still present, there is a greater proportion of soft, acoustic tracks which reflects the influences of English folk music.  Soft is a relative term however, and while this may be the mellowest recording in the Led Zeppelin catalog, it is still pretty thunderous (the Immigrant Song always elevated my blood pressure).<br /><br />Elevated blood pressure aside, I have to say that I really appreciate the softer side of the group and find this album to be especially enjoyable.  Some of my favorite Led Zeppelin tracks are on this album including the mellow acoustic track That's the Way, the melodic Tangerine, and the electrifying heavy blues/rock of Since I've Been Loving You.  Come to think of it, the album is fairly diverse and is a fine example of their brand of eclectic \\"heavy metal\\". Other highlights include the (fairly early) use of the mini-moog synthesizer at the end of Friends, the drumming of John Bonham, and the acoustic guitar work of Jimmy Page.<br /><br />This 1994 remaster is OK and the sound quality is not too shabby.  Overall though, the CD package does not come close to the high quality of my old (and dearly departed) vinyl LP.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Led Zeppelin III does not receive the acclaim of albums such as II (1969) and IV (1971), which is too bad.  It seems to me that this excellent album would offer a lot to the Led Zeppelin fan; both casual and hardcore alike.
1594202249|4.0|I hope that Pynchon pocketed a few Benjies for the effort, even if Doc had a problem with the pay for play format.  No doubt this was a page turner like he's never offered before.  But for all the appeal of kanoodling in a comfortable vehicle parked in a favorite hide-away, the passion here is sentimental and not electric.  Clever to the max, but without the moments of magic that others have worked in this genre, let alone the gasping brilliance that marked the author's earlier triumphs.  As much as he piles on extra toppings of topical reference, he can't generate the 60's giddiness that he totally mastered in Lot 49.      But this is like complaining that the next CD you hear isn't Marx and Lennon or the movie you saw last night wasn't Chinatown.  You can't just crank the stuff out.  Meanwhile, as entertainment goes, you'd be hard pressed to find a better best seller to relax with, nor a more profitable investment of your spare time.  Certainly makes the strongest argument possible to stop stirring up trouble and get back to blowing some cool sax.    Mr. Peabody didn't whisk us back to the revolution in his way-back machine.  But it sure was fun daydreaming about chasing Moriarity through groovier times.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Bob Harris (Bill Murray) arrives in Tokyo nursing killer jetlag and an ever-widening gulf between his personal aspirations and his professional obligations, as well as a marriage succumbing to the laws of entropy; A middle-aged actor of some repute and former stardom, he checks into a luxurious Japanese hotel and girds his loins in order to get through a three day stint starring in a Whiskey commercial for which he is being paid an obscene amount of money.    Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) haunts the corridors of the same hotel, as well as the streets of Tokyo, while her husband, John (Giovanni Ribisi), is off photographing obscenely hip bands around Japan for a magazine spread. Recently married, lacking a palpable direction in life and recently transposed to L.A. from New York, Charlotte feels like the proverbial lost soul.    Bob and Charlotte, strangers in a strange land, notice each other, meet and strike up an unlikely acquaintance and this beautifully shot and languidly paced film leaves it up to the audience to decide what really happens next.    Sofia Coppola's \\"Lost In Translation\\" is hands-down one of my favourite films of all time.     Its about insomnia; jetlag; bad lounge bands; not knowing which dish on the menu is which; drunken nights in karaoke bars with people who have just become your new best friends; strange new cultures; unconsummated passions; the beauty of solitary moments; waking up in a strange new place; the ambiguity of human relationships; the frisson of recognition when you first realise the connection with a kindred spirit and the utter banality of most Hollywood films. It is slowly paced, beautifully crafted, touching in parts, hypnotic in others and is occasionally wince-inducingly funny.     It also boasts a gorgeous soundtrack featuring the likes of Air, Squarepusher, and Mount Sims.    It is also unequivocally 'not' just a \\"mid-life crisis\\" movie. Or if it is, it's the \\"mid-life crisis\\" movie that the world deserves.    Its a filmthat will soothe the soul, lighten the burden, lull you to sleep and leave you wanting to breathe the crisp morning air after a drunken night on the town.
B002FRNCG0|4.0|There is a mix on Brand New Eyes. This album isn't their best album yet. There could of been a few songs on this album that shouldn't of been on here. Paramore is still going strong with half the album, the other half isn't as great as it could have been. I think the best song on this album is Decode, also from the Twilight soundtrack. I wanted Brand New Eyes to have a lot of songs like Decode, but Brand New Eyes, is a lot like Riot! I thought they would have changed it up a bit on their third album.
B001AUEMFS|4.0|A great song that has various instruments flowing together.  I have to admit Chris Martin wasn't lying when he boasted that Coldplay became one of the best groups ever since the Beatles.
B002POMLHY|2.0|So here we have another \\"Opinion\\" on this CD.  But I'm sure the fan boi's will flame on when reading this.    I was eagerly awaiting this release as I have loved everything these guys have put out.  Every release seemed to get better and better.  I heard the new single \\"I Will Not Bow\\" and was just as excited for this release.  But after hearing the bits and pieces pre-release, I started to get a little worried.  The songs just didn't seem to have the same fire and bite that previous songs had.  They seemed more toned down and slower instead.  But I figured I'd give it a fair listen before making a final judgement.    Well, I've listened to the disc several times, and I just can't get excited for this.  There are even several points in the songs that make me think, \\"Hey, where have I heard this before, oh yeah, Phobia.\\"  Here are some examples, now keep in mind, they aren't an exact copy, but damn they sound close enough.    Song 1 - his vocal style on the song sounds extremely similar to Diary of Jane.  Several verses I was thinking \\"Wow, he sang this the same way for Diary of Jane\\"    Song 3 - Again, the vocal style repeats a few parts of breath.  Not nearly as much as the previous mention, but it's clearly there.    After that, I just kinda get lost and bored with the songs.  there are a few that are ok, but nothing that blew me away like the rest of their albums.    I'm sorry if the fan bois can't take an opinion, but this is just they way I feel about this release, it in no way means I hate Breaking Benjamin, I just expected more from this release.  I also hoped for something a tad bit longer as well.
B001W63DY6|3.0|This show is fantastic, beautiful but unfortunately doesn´t appear the most famous song to her.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|I was suprised at the digital quality of this movie considering it was made about 6 years ago. If you enjoyed this movie before, you will love this in Blu ray.
0553582038|5.0|What can I say that has not already been said? Hopefully quite a bit. To start with, this is one of the best fantasy series I have ever read, but if you're reading the reviews for A Feast for Crows you probably already have an opinion of your own (and if you got this far it's probably a favorable one). The action slows down in AFFC, so we don't get the fighting we're used to. This seems to be one of the most common complaints, so let me address it. The War of the Five Kings is pretty much over after the Red Wedding. Stannis is all but broken, Robb and Renly are both dead. The only major threat to the Iron Throne (that they know of) comes from the Iron Isles, and the Greyjoys don'[t have the strength to do much more than raid. Of course the battles will no longer come thick and fast, the south is at an uneasy peace. I felt that this book was portraying the consequences of such a devastating war and setting the stage for the endgame, really. It just added to the realism. Eventually everyone will run out of knights and smallfolk if they don't slow down the choppy.    The other most common issue is the lack of certain characters. I was disappointed not to find my boys Tyrion or Jon Snow taking center stage (or, indeed, any stage) as they rightfully should, but the cast has grown so large now that it would be virtually impossible to get everyone in. Some may say that's a bad thing, but I like seeing all these minor characters crop up. I want to know a little more about Tytos Blackwood and Ser Tallad, even if that means it takes a little longer to get to my favorites. Martin has a gift for writing rounded, believable people, and this demonstrates the awesome. We still have to put up with Cersei as a POV, but I didn't mind so much considering the direction the story took with her. All I'm saying.    The next book can't be that far away by now (I feel for the people who discovered these more than a couple of years back) and that should have more than enough Jon Snow, Tyrion, Dany, Bran, and cliffhanger resolution for us all, even those of us who still like Theon. All three of you.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|Breaking Benjamin is back with Dear Agony, and I couldn't wait any longer. It's been three years since Phobia was released. The only think i dislike about this album is the short of length this album is, this album is only 41 minutes long. This album is great, one of my favorite albums of 2009.
B001BZF9UY|5.0|Like John Williams Hans Zimmer brings down the house with this soundtrack.  From the errie strings intro to the thunderous drums and bass the whole soundtrack can make the hairs on the back of your neck stand at attention.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|One of Dustin Hoffman's best.  The story is haunting and told in narrative that keeps you completely mesmerized.  Give this movie a try.
B002HNA95E|1.0|I know some of you are getting a bit upset with that introduction but lets just get down to it. There is no way to really complain about what should have or what should have not been on this disc. It is impossible to put everyone's favorite on this two disc retrospective since everyone has their own opinion on which is the better madonna songs. After spanning nearly three decades it would be a very daunting task. Case in point while some people cried because \\"you'll see\\" wasn't included, thank god...I really hate that song....so there you go. I will only focus on what IS on it. How could anyone say a madonna retrospective is HORRIBLE you say? Well let me start by saying most die hard fans already have these version, so just so you're not confused as to what you got and what you really should have gotten. i'll break it down.     DISC ONE    1 hung up - album version.. (should have been the single version this one is way too long and gets a bit repetitious)    2 music - album version.     3 vogue - immaculate version.. (should have been the single version, which has only been available on a cd single, this version is more of a pop masterpiece)    4 4 minutes - album version    5 holiday - album version (should have been the single version that has never been released on cd with the exception of the 1,000 dollar import box set)    6 everybody - album version (there is a single/edit that's slightly different that's better)    7 like a virgin - album version (this one should have been the immaculate version which at least sounded better and stayed true to it's original form)    8 into the groove - 2 cut-maxi single version and the first time released on an official madonna release (bravo- at least it wasn't the immaculate version which was horrible and stripped away it's pure pop sound, this will be the song that defined the pop sound of the 80's)    9 like a prayer - album version (they should have put the 7 inch/edit version which has never been available on cd only ona rare promotional dj copy)    10 ray of light - album edit    11 sorry - single version (this version was segued on the confession's album so it's nice to have it singled out in it's entirety)    12 express yourself - this is an alternate version to the 7 inch single. (i hate to say it but the immaculate version is better)    13 open your heart - album version (there is an edit of the extended version that is the best version of this song..wish they would have included this)    14 borderline - immaculate version (they should have put the original single version that was released. The best version of this song by far. The immaculate version strips the song of that great madonna sound that made her work sound like a true artist when every critic described her as just a \\"bubble-gum\\" star. This version proved them all wrong. It has not been available on cd and can only be found on the 1,000 dollar singles box set)    15 secret - album edit (what can i say if it got any longer I don't think i could stand it: on a side not the single club remix is better)    16 erotica - album edit (taken from the erotica album that was overlooked at the time due to her sex book. That album is a great one..even the b-sides are good. Secret garden by far a favorite b-side of mine)    17 justify my love - immaculate version (this version is the non-q sound version. That version was released as a single and if played would blow out your speakers because the bass line was so loud it drowned out the song. Another great madonna song by the way.     18 revolver- single (when i first heard it it sounded like a britney spears song (ugh another reason not to listen to top 40 airplay) so I immediately skipped it)    DISC TWO    1 dress you up - album version (although this is the original version, there is an edit/remix promotional version, not available on cd, that's a twin of into the groove, pure pop and equally as good)    2 material girl - album version (should have used the immaculate version better only because it sounds way better but stays true to the original form)    3 la isla bonita - album version (the version you heard on the radio when it was originally released was a 7 inch remix/edit that is only available on vinyl..this version is way better, the immaculate version is the closest to it and should have been included)    4 papa don't preach - album version (some things you just should not change this version is one of them)    5 lucky star - immaculate version (hate this version. The one they should have included should have been the original 7 inch edit version when it was first released. It has never been availble on cd. But in my opinion the extended video version is the best one)    6 burning up - album version (there's a single extended edit that the only reason it's a toss up is because at the very end the background singing is slightly more noticeable and makes the song better because of it)    7 crazy for you - vision quest version (immaculate version sounds better while also staying true to it's original form)    8 who's that girl - soundtrack version (there is a very rare edit of the extended remix that is the best verson of this song, but this version is what everyone rememebers and it is a good one)    9 frozen - album edit (there is a single edit that's only 4 min's and 47 seconds long and is way better. The longer versions gets to be repititous)    10 miles away - album version (the morgan page edit is the best version)    11 take a bow - album version (this song is like her acting a bit over dramatic and just a bit too much. They killed it on the radio and on mtv so maybe that's what did it..it is a good song but only if you listen to it once a year)    12 live to tell - album version (the single edit version is the best one. It gets right to the point instead of being all over drawn with the before and middle piano break. There is an even shorter version that's rare but it has the beginning piano and even the middle piano break removed entirely and if you can find it it's the best version)    13 beautiful stranger - album version (this is where madonna went wrong in my opinion. This is where she got bored. If you get this song, die another day, and the american life album it's like listening to the same song altogether. When they came out you really didn't know which song it was but you knew it was one of them. What can I say..hate it and a waste of madonna creativity.     14 hollywood - album vesion (another reason why this album tanked. Sometimes madonna should go with the remixed version's instead of the album one's when making an album. This is a perfect example where creative control decisions should go else where. The white-duck single mix is the best version of this mess if you had to listen to it.     15 die another day - album version (I still don't know what this song is about? Can someone give me a clue here?? Another waste of a madonna creativity that feels as if her concentration was on some other earth shattering project rather than in the studio.     16 don't tell me - album version- (the single edit is the best version it doesn't have that two minute long violin or whatever instrument she's trying to learn fade at the end)    17 cherish - immaculate version (the single/fade version is better)    18 celebration - single version (this is a good madonna song because it takes us back to her pop sound. Kinda feels like it could have been released during her like a virgin era.     As you can see now, most of these selections were pulled straight from the immaculate album, the greatest hits vol 2, and from the album's themselves. All of which every die hard madonna fan already has. They should have put the single versions that were originally released because that is what we remember hearing that made Madonna who she is. A POP ICON. Especially since they have not been available up to this point. They failed to do that. And for those who say that it's good to include these versions so future madonna fans will discover her work. They will discover versions that did not make that first initial impact that made you notice the sound, the style, and importantly the music that is madonna.     On another side note: This 2-disc retrospective was madonna's last contract obligation she has with warner brothers so maybe the track listing as well as the selected versions were purposely chosen to save these rarities for a future madonna box set who knows.
B00005T30L|4.0|In some ways, the film \\"Ghost World(2001)\\" is brilliant. Few films have captured on such a realistic and intimate level, the plight of so many people both lost and alone. It's a portrait of modern society that really  should be discussed alot more than it is.<br /><br />The plot follows two High School pals(Thora Birch and Scarlet Johansson) and there travels  into adult life and responsibility. The film begins very humorously with the sardonic duo's comments on the plastic people that occupy everyday society, both biting and honest. However, there maturity,and ultimately, purpose is challenged, when one of there pranks goes awry on a lonely record collector played by Steve Buscemi. After this encounter, the duo become more seperate. Johansson begins to mellow out and finds a job and responsibility, while Birch attempts to find her place in the world as everything chnages around her.<br /><br />The acting in \\"Ghost World\\" is among the best presented this decade. Birch and Johansson are both excellent and it was not surprising to see them gain careers from this picture. They are both funny and exceptionally beautiful young women which sets a basis for one of the film's thesis', particularly in Birch's case. Birch is an exceptionally pretty and very well formed young woman who can't seem to find friends or a date. Men barely notice her and it's based more around her choice of clothing and intellectual side than anything. Birch's subtle signs of loneliness are very real and reflect many young people that i've known. Her seemingly sardonic asides and attitude merely masking her yearning for acceptance and love that she only encounters seldomly. The eventual relationship she has with Buscemi's character is very heartfelt and moving throughout and forms one of the anchors to the picture.<br /><br />Johansson's character is representive of that character that many of us have to become in order to survive in society. While intelligent and looking down ona grea number of society, she ultimately is forced to conform to survive and her needs and interests change as a result. She becomes largely absent from the second half of the picture but her friendship with Birch is important and moving nonetheless. The subtle farewell scene they have at the conclusion is so quietly painful.<br /><br />Buscemi deserved an Oscar for this, his best role. An almost clueless loner who collects records and old paraphenalia, admitting that they act as a replacement for the lack of people within his life. He is a realistic and sympathetic character and always interesting throughout. The actor has made a career out of playing eccentrics and weirdos and while some may classify his character as a \\"weirdo\\", he's really one of the most normal and human characters i've seen depicted in cinema in quite some time.<br /><br />This is an exceptionally well directed film and thankfully never falls to the excessive fast-paced editing and new age nonsense that distracts from so many modern productions. It's well paced and always is the film entertaining and enthralling.<br />It's unfortunate that the ending is so ambiguous. While, it is understandable what the author's intentions may have been, that of having Birch either drift away from life and dissapear and/or be swallowed up in the shallow recesses of mature monotony, this does not make a fully suitable ending. After two hours with these characters, the final seven minutes of the film are somewhat dissapointing, even if they can be forgiveable.<br /><br />Despite this ending though, \\"Ghost World\\" still ranks as one of the most intelligent and best acted films of this decade and is highly reccomended for fans of Dark Comedy and Existentionalist Cinema.forced to conform to survive and her needs and interests change as a result.

B002FRNCG0|3.0|The rock band Paramore hasn't been without its share of problems in its history, and some of that anger gets vented out on their latest release.  Although the album cover depicts the darker, more serious tone of Paramore's third full-length record, secondarily it could represent the bands' spreading its wings stylistically...growing away from the formulaic, commercialized sound that dominated their previous effort, the Platinum \\"Riot!\\".    While \\"Brand New Eyes\\" starts off with two catchy, up-tempo numbers tailor-made to get fans off their feet singing along at concerts, the rest of the compilation includes enough variety in tempo, instrumentation and style that critics will find it much more difficult to claim all the songs sound the same this time around.    Musicianship is excellent.  Hayley Williams sings her heart out.  The production is superb (Rob Cavallo, who's worked with artists David Cook, Goo Goo Dolls and Green Day to name a few, gives us punchy drums, grungy, powerful guitars and clean vocals).    But for some reason, it isn't happening for me.  I've been listening over and over wanting to like it.  I like parts of several songs...the finger-picked clean guitar part at the beginning and other points in \\"Playing God\\", the pre-chorus and a small part in the chorus of \\"Brick By Boring Brick\\", the chorus of \\"Turn It Off\\", the verse of \\"Feeling Sorry\\".  \\"Looking Up\\" and \\"All I Wanted\\" are better, but still nothing to write home about.  \\"Misguided Ghosts\\" seems like it should be a beautiful song, but it's not moving me.  And I don't like \\"The Only Exception\\" at all...it doesn't sound even remotely like a Paramore song.  Nothing here makes me want to dig deeper into the supposedly better lyrics.    The only thing I can think of?  I miss those formulaic, commercial Paramore songs...the \\"Misery Business\\" and \\"That's What You Get\\"-type songs.  I miss the soaring melodies that have been sending chills down my spine...I'm not hearing them here.     I think most fans will like \\"Brand New Eyes\\".  But I'm just not hearing any blow-your-socks-off songs here.  I may be wrong (and I hope I am), but I don't see this album having a very long life after initial sales.  I recommend giving these songs a good listen before you buy, because you may find you're not feeling it either.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|Muse isn't new for me but this is the first CD that I really like . I heard Absolution and Showbiz and they are also amazing but this CD is GREAT! I gave it only 4 points becuase \\"United stats of eurasia\\" and Unnatural selection\\" they are the \\"wickest songs in this album .   Anyway go and buy it !     Great songs to hear:     Resistance  Undisclosed desires  MK Ultra  Ibelong to you   Exogenesis pt 1,2,3 -Amazing!!!

0393327655|4.0|I came into this book already believing in Harris' central thesis. In the first few chapters he brilliantly sets forth arguments that would be difficult to adequately refute. However, I have some serious qualms with his final two chapters. Early on in the book Harris argues the evils of religion by demonstrating just how barbaric religion can cause people to behave by giving examples of early christian torture devices that personally made me quite uneasy. Harris explains how these sessions of torture would always result in false confessions. Harris even gives an example of a judge who began to feel suspicious of the reliability of torture to elicit meaningful confessions. Upon the judge voicing his concern that torture may elicit false confessions about being a witch, he himself was tortured and then confessed to being a witch. Yet, Harris then proceeds, in the second to last chapter, to defend torture if it will help elicit any response. He claims that anything is better than nothing. It seemed to me that Harris contradicted himself and reserved the right to torture to the \\"enlightened\\" modern thinkers, while condemning the medieval torturers. I feel that Harris' attitude toward torture is that medieval torture was wrong because it was done in the name of religion, but modern forms of torture are acceptable because they may save a persons life. However, to me, torture is torture regardless of the intentions or reasons for torturing.<br />The final chapter I found to be peculiar. Harris seems to embrace, although he claims otherwise, the teachings of Buddhism. Either way, I found the final chapter irrelevant to the book as a whole. The premise of the book was to debunk the validity faith, not advocate a replacement.<br />I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 because of the last two chapters. I know I focused on the negatives in this review, but the book is very enjoyable and I would highly recommend it.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|When Alice in Chains released their self-titled album in 1995, it showed the band moving in a different direction from the one they'd explored previously. Jerry Cantrell was singing lead on more tracks than ever before, Layne Staley's vocals were heavily layered (double-tracked), and the grunge sound they'd had turned into a more sludge-metal type sound. Staley died 7 years after the release of that album and it appeared for a while that Alice in Chains had died with him. I worship Layne Staley, but I realize he was not solely responsible for creating the Alice in Chains sound; but, he did leave a large void when he passed away. Since Alice in Chains announced they were recording a new album with new vocalist/guitarist William DuVall, the question running through people's minds has been \\"Can they do it without Layne?\\" Well, after steadily listening to this album since it leaked, I can tell you, in all honesty, that they can.    \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" picks up pretty much where that last album left off. This is not \\"Dirt Pt. II,\\" but Alice in Chains for 2009 and even with Staley gone, the album still retains the recognizable Alice in Chains sound. There are moments where you can not only feel Staley's presence, you can almost hear his voice. While William DuVall is technically Layne Staley's replacement, Jerry Cantrell handles a large majority of lead vocal duties...But make no mistake, this is not a Jerry Cantrell solo album. This is very much an Alice in Chains album. When DuVall and Cantrell harmonize together in the way Staley and Cantrell did so many years ago, it's pretty clear that Alice in Chains is back.    Here is a track-by-track review;    1. All Secrets Known-Begins with a terrific guitar riff and instead of launching into a brutal, blistering metal song becomes simply a subtle track about moving on. \\"There's no going back to the place we started from,\\" sort of perfectly sums up their desire to record this album despite the cries of \\"It won't be the same\\" from many fans. (4/5)    2. Check My Brain-Another great riff; also the 2nd single from the album. DuVall lurks in the background, only really handling harmony duties with Cantrell, but this song rocks and is just as good as old Alice in Chains. (5/5)    3. Last of My Kind-On the third track, DuVall handles the lead vocals and his voice, by itself, works very well in AIC. DuVall also penned this track...This is a catchy, hard-rocking song; one of my favorites on the album. (5/5)    4. Your Decision-Instantly reminiscent of \\"Nutshell.\\" It's a great/beautiful track with a fantastic guitar solo by Cantrell (who also handles a good  majority of the lead vocals). (5/5)    5. A Looking in View-The first single Alice in Chains released from this album. A little over 7 minutes, this track instantly got me excited for the new album. This doesn't just sound like classic Alice in Chains, it IS classic Alice in Chains. Great vocal harmonies, great music, and a terrific chorus. There's parts of this song that literally sound like Layne Staley has been brought back to life (5/5)    6. When the Sun Rose Again-A beautiful song that I intitally wasn't too fond of. Sounds like an extension of the \\"Jar of Flies\\" sound. (5/5)    7. Acid Bubble-Almost 7 minutes long; One of the best on the album, but also took a bit to grow on me...The song is character by slow verses sung simultaneously by Cantrell and DuVall, with DuVall singing the chilling bridge of the song before launching into a brilliantly harmonized chorus, and finally there's the heavy interlude. This song is a masterpiece. (5/5)    8. Lesson Learned-Has been one of my favorite tracks on the album since I first heard it. It's a great song and when Cantrell & DuVall sing \\"In your darkest hour, you strike gold,\\" I get goosebumps. It's really a fantastic song. (5/5)    9. Take Her Out-This is the weakest song on the album, in my opinion. It's not a bad song by any means, it's just weaker than the other tracks...However, it does have a good chorus. (4/5)    10. Private Hell-I really didn't like this song at first, but now I find it one of the most powerful. The vocals here are very Layne Staley-esque and it's a very powerful, personal song. This, more than almost all the others, reminded me of classic AIC. In the vein of \\"Down in a Hole,\\" give this song some time if you don't like it immediately. It's a great track (5/5)    11. Black Gives Way to Blue-The final track has some haunting guitar courtesy of Cantrell and piano by Elton John; dedicated to the memory of Staley, it's a beautiful, haunting, and touching song. A great track and a great way to close the album.    Jerry Cantrell has been outspoken about his goal not to destroy the Alice in Chains legacy with this album and I'm beyond proud to report that he did no such thing. This is a more-than-worthy entry in a great band's career, but more importantly...It's a great album, by itself. This is not a retread of Alice in Chains or an attempt to capture the same magic as before...This is just a fantastic album by a hard-working, musically gifted band that would be a great album no matter what moniker the band carried with them. Listen with an open-mind and be happy that AIC is moving on from the memory of Layne Staley to still give us fans great music. I guarantee that Layne Staley is smiling right now and would be pleased with the great work these four guys have done.    GRADE: A
0439023491|4.0|So i really loved these books! I am just so confused these days on what is considered \\"young adult\\"! Really an enjoyable series and recommend them to everyone..but kind of violent for \\"young adult\\" in my opinion. Can someone explain to me how they categorize a book?
B001NFNFNU|5.0|When I ask some of my friends what sources they use to figure out if a movie is worth watching, I get \\"Amazon reviews\\" as the most frequent answer - especially as of lately. And this tops Ebert, Maltin, and even AMG! That's how I stumbled upon the Changeling: I accidentally saw the DVD cover with 4 1/2 stars and a number next to it - the number pointed to over 150 reviews with the 4 1/2 star average. That sound very good for a new movie, considering the variety of backgrounds and preferences of the Amazon reviewers. And what a movie it is! Great cinematography, great storyline, and I never thought Angelina Jolie could be that good of an actress (yet after all, she is the daughter of actor Jon Voight). And what is also impressive is that despite of the sadness and distress of the subject matter, it manages to communicate hope.<br />It is also interesting to do some quick research on wikipedia on the subject - since it is a true story. Even the evil Gordon Northcott in the movie looked very much like the photograph posted on the site.

0385504225|4.0|Dan Brown, in [[ASIN:0385504225 The Lost Symbol]] takes us on another thrilling ride through the \\"Ancient Mysteries.\\" Robert Langdon, the Harvard Symbologist, carries us along through numerous brink-of-death situations, giving the book edge-of-your-seat momentum.   Numerous reviews have discussed the plot, so I will move directly to my comments.    First, I enjoyed the amusement park ride.  Since I am often reading non-fiction titles, when I pick up fiction I want to be entertained, drawn into the story, intrigued. I read it in one sitting. The puzzles (ok, I confess I am a Sudoku fan, the magic square) the misdirection, the chases, I enjoyed the ride.      I also enjoyed these quotes sprinkled throughout the book. My favorites:     \\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\\" Arthur C. Clarke, Futurist,  (The Lost Symbol, pg 86) Instantly brought to mind my first experiences with a fax machine! The paper gets there how???     \\"Wide acceptance of an idea does not prove its validity.\\" The Lost Symbol, pg 79  I love this one.  It seems everyday our news reports include  lady-in-the-Laundromat  or   the man-in-the-deli  opinions validating a popular (but uninformed, unsubstantiated) opinion. Of course, here Brown uses it to fuel his challenge-all-religion stance... belittling myths of his choosing.   Setting that aside, I still love the quote.    \\"If thoughts affect the world, then we must be very careful how we think. Destructive thoughts have influence, too, and we all know it's far easier to destroy than to create.\\"  Lost Symbol, pg 501.  Can we make this every school's motto?  I'm a positive thinker, I'm a half-full glass person, and have witnessed the power of prayer, so this resonates with me.  In fact, when Brown's story descends to the depths, I cringed and almost stopped reading.     Thirdly, I thoroughly enjoyed the setting of Washington DC.  On a recent visit to Alexandria, VA driving to the Old Town on Carlisle Drive, we stumbledupon stunning monument/museum called the George Washington Masonic National Memorial.  I had completely forgotten that Washington was a freemason, and was amazed how \\"unhidden\\" it was, for this society with secrets.  Brown mentions it in the book, along with numerous buildings and their histories.  As an avid reader, and a book professional, I thoroughly enjoyed the character's \\"ride\\" on the circulation belt... something I would have loved to do!   The Washington setting will undoubtedly boost the attraction of these majestic buildings.     On the negative side, I was distracted by the believability of his facts.  As a widely read person, I was often thinking that doesn't sound true, I should research that.  When I pick up fiction, I don't expect to get homework assignments!  If you can remind yourself to stick to the story, and not remember the inaccuracies as fact, the read could still work.  When you recommend a book to a friend, the fear is they could trustingly embrace it as historically accurate, hence the caution.      For example, the Akedah is a historically substantiated story of Abraham, in obedience to God's command, willing to sacrifice his own son, Isaac. God intervenes with a substitute sacrifice, showing His love for Abraham.   In the Lost Symbol, pg 445, Brown invents an actual knife; the \\"Akedah Knife\\", gives it mystical properties and a \\"destiny\\" to fulfill.  All the while alluding that his story, Peter Solomon/Zachary and Abraham/Isaac is one and the same.    Brown's creating the son's desire to self-sacrifice and involve his father, twists this historical story into a meaningless one.   One wonders why Brown's fiction needs to dig at the tenets of the various religious worldviews.  Is it to create the controversy that sells lots of books?  You decide.    Throughout the story we observe the premise \\"how to die\\", over and over.  I, on the other hand would have celebrated the characters that portray, how to live. The love of a friend, sister, brother, fellow believer, to go to whatever lengths necessary to help.        Despite the inaccuracies, I would recommend this title to fiction readers who love to discuss the latest bestseller `round cocktails or the water cooler, readers who can separate fact from fiction, and to readers, who can suspend their disbelief and just enjoy the ride.
B001TODCII|4.0|I thought this was a good movie.  Liam Neeson plays a father whose daughter is taken by human traffickers.  He's a retired government agent and knows how to kick butt.  He does a lot of killing and head busting in this movie and they all deserve it.  This movie makes you wish you could fight like Liam and take on several bad guys at one time.  It did have the Steven Segal and the Jason Statham fight feel; lots of bad guys against one.  It is a good action film worth seeing more than once and even though Liam does look older, he pulled the vengeful father part off quite nice.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Well, thank heavens she didn't disappoint.   Same lush vocals, same great pipes, altogether terrific mix of delights.  I always wish artists well and in Witney's case I am beside myself with relief and joy that her album made it so fast to #1 on Billboard (of course I checked!).  There are few things more emotionally satisfying than a well-earned comeback, and girl, ya did it!  Mad love.
B002POMLHY|4.0|It would not be unreasonable to call Breaking Benjamin my favorite band. I've certainly been looking forward to Dear Agony for a while now. \\"I will not bow\\" is certainly a great track. As other users have stated, it's a different album, a little more sedate than Phobia or Saturate. I'm not disappointed at all, but it didn't blow me away :-)
B0026RHR6K|4.0|The show gets 5 stars, the packaging gets 3 stars, so that averages out to 4 stars for this collection.  The box is really big and odd.  They could have come up with any number of better designs.  Regardless, the Cylon that comes with it is neat and the show is incredible, so I am happy I bought this collection.
B001FOR5XU|5.0|This book is very suspenseful - keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I'm only part way through but can already tell it's much better than the movie.  I'm not sure why they didn't just follow the book more closely.  Definitely worth reading!
B002JYPV3G|5.0|I've been a Slipknot fan since '99 when I saw them on Ozzfest, and like another reviewer said, this is the fourth time I've purchased this album. There's really nothing here that can't be found elsewhere, other than the Wait and Bleed demo. Purity is back, but the Frail Limb Nursery intro is missing... that's not a big deal to me since I have the original pressing with Frail Limb Nursery/Purity, but I can see how its absence could disappoint fans who weren't fortunate enough to pick that version up before it was discontinued. Sure it's just a 45 second intro, but it's just as much a part of the original release as any other track and it made for a smoother transition between Tattered & Torn and Purity. If the disk's running time was an issue I'm sure they could have easily dedicated one disk to the original release and put the bonus tracks on another. The band had a hand in deciding what tracks went on this special edition and they wanted it to be perfect, there has to be a better excuse than that...    Honestly, the DVD is the real reason to pick this up. It has three vidoes (which were already available on [[ASIN:B00007BHOE Slipknot - Disasterpieces]], definitely a must have for any Slipknot fan), an entire live set recorded at Dynamo Open Air Festival in 2000 that was originally intended for a second home movie, and a ton of randomness from various live shows and offstage footage strung together in a similar (but much more cohesive and enjoyable) fashion to their third DVD release, [[ASIN:B000BNJOUI Voliminal: Inside the Nine]]. It would have been nice to have had retrospective interviews with a few members of the band discussing how they feel about the album after 10 years and the success it brought them, but considering how busy the band's mouthpieces (Corey, Joey, and Clown) are even when they're not touring, that might have been nearly impossible to arrange.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|The reviews are in, and I'm not in the least bit surprised how positive they've been. Like many, I was skeptical about this reunion at first, but it completely delivers. The new AIC manages to pay tribute to the monumentally influential sound they forged in their first albums, mixing the classic psychedelic sludgy stuff with the introspective and unique acoustic melodies. As many reviewers have mentioned, they introduce Duvall in an understated fashion and bring him along nicely. While Staley's raw power and emotion will never be forgotten, Duvall harmonizes beautifully with Cantrell and adds a nice vocal range as well as guitar playing and songwriting chops. I didn't like him at first when they reformed, but after listening to Black Gives Way to Blue, I believe he's a perfect fit.    Definitely worthy of 5 stars.  I love Pearl Jam too, and I was severely disappointed in their latest effort, so I calls 'em as I sees 'em. So excited that AIC has picked up right where they left off, and I can't wait to see how they continue to evolve on future albums.
B000H7JCIW|5.0|Really loved this video. Received it within 2 days of purchasing it. I had seen this video several years ago and was glad I was able to locate it and buy it for my own video collection.
B0000AMRJD|5.0|It would be hard to over-compliment this film. So I will not try, but it probably should be seen by students, high school and above, just to get one aspect of our society in perspective.    We move so rapidly on to new trends and new dramatic situations in our country that we forget what some older films portraying a segment of our culture has to tell us.  This film tells us a lot!!
B002KVSJ64|5.0|In writing a review of \\"Dear Agony\\" I must first say I realize that I am writing a review of a Breaking Benjamin album and not expecting them to be Muse, Tool, Thrice, a Jack White project, or anyone else who is trying to experimentally push musical boundaries. I admire those artists, and greatly respect their talents, but come on, that's not what BB has ever been about. I think this album is every bit as good, and better in some respects, than anything they have ever done.    With that being said, I think this is a very solid, cohesive album. The production is outstanding, everything sounds clear and precise. Ben's vocals range from brooding and smooth to deeply aggressive and growling.  The lyrics cover familiar territory ranging from suffering and anger to determination, hope, and restoration. Definitely some familiar dark territory is covered, but there is one small twist here from old subject matter. Pervading throughout the album seems to be a theme of sickness and recovery. It's very direct in the songs \\"Dear Agony\\" and \\"Fade Away\\", but there seems to be a reference in almost every song.  I can't deny I have become increasingly curious about Ben's health since he missed some previous concert dates.  Regardless, I think Ben's talented voice and genuine emotional delivery are what keep this band from being another face in the crowd.    The band seems to try a couple of different techniques on this album, but nothing that would constitute a drastic change in sound. The guitars melodically weave around the vocals at some points, and then grind and drive with solid, heavy riffs in others. The heavy distortion of Aaron's guitar endures from track to track with few short guitar solos spread throughout the album.  Mark's thundering bass lines rotate between blending into the grinding riffs, to breaking out into the forefront in some songs.  I really enjoy Chad Szeliga's drumming, he finds ways to insert cymbal crashes and riffs into songs that I find unique (see crash cymbal in chorus of \\"What lies beneath\\".)  It is very solid musicianship, which employs much of what has become their signature sound.  This creates something that fans will surely like, but critics will for sure attack for lack of originality.    The album has a consistent flow to it; I don't see any track as filler. I would say that it is better than \\"Phobia\\" in that respect.  Although, I doubt they will score a hit as big as \\"Breath\\" with this album. \\"I Will Not Bow\\" has already charted better than \\"Until the End\\" and I'm sure there will be more singles to follow. Only four tracks exceed the four minute mark.  \\"Fade Away\\", \\"Give me a Sign\\", \\"Crawl\\", \\"Dear Agony\\", and \\"Anthem of the Angels\\" could all be single material. \\"Hopeless\\" is also an early favorite of mine, but is a little heavier than most of their radio releases.     The songs on this album are at least on par with, if not better than, their previous platinum efforts. It's also produced better than anything they've ever put out.  Once again I'm sure fans will appreciate it and consider it a welcome addition to the band's catalog.  Critics of the band or of the genre will not be converted by this album. Depending on your stance, the band's strong or weak point is that they sound like themselves. Maybe I'm just a fan, but I was waiting for this one to come out for a while and I am not disappointed at all.  If you have enjoyed BB in the past, I would highly encourage you to pick this up.  I look forward to seeing some of the new material performed live!
B001TKKAJG|5.0|Having bought music on vinyl and paid again for the same music on CD, I am now going through a third phase of buying whatever is available in the genres I like on SACD.  SACD has the convenience of CD with much superior sound quality - I actually prefer it to LPs.    This SACD of a classic is highly recommended.  All else is gaslight?

B0029LHW4U|3.0|Since my review is fairly long here is the condensed version for those with a short attention span: If you liked Alice in Chains for their chunky riffs, acoustic textures, harmonies and quality song-writing then you will thoroughly enjoy Black Gives Way to Blue. If you loved Alice in Chains more because of the raw emotion driven by the powerful, soulful and artistic vocal approach and sonic mood swings, you will be largely disappointed. If you liked them for both qualities, you'll have mixed feelings. Personally, the reason I fell in love with Alice in Chains was for the emotion and feel largely due to Layne Staley, and seeing how the only singer they have with any soulfulness now (Duvall) is largely underused on BGWTB, it ends up coming short of the mark for an Alice in Chains record, but makes the grade as a Jerry Cantrell record and then some. Of all of the Jerry Cantrell or Alice in Chains records, it sounds closest to Degradation Trip. Now for the full review...     Right when we all thought the Alice in Chains and Stone Temple Pilots reunions were the story of the year, along came Creed to spoil the party, trying to capitalize on milking the market. Creed's return is a little late though, because to many of us Alice in Chains never really disappeared anyways, at least in their current form. If you're not sure what I'm talking about, I have to ask you where the heck were you when Boggy Depot was released in 1998, or when the masterpiece Degradation Trip was released in 2002? If you call yourself an Alice in Chains fan you own at least one of those and used them to fill the void. More or less they are just as Alice-y as this release, just without the name attached.     Nonetheless, they returned after those semi-Alice releases with friends to raise money for the victims of the tsunami in 2005, only to follow that up with a self-organized world tour with Duvall taking on the role of lead singer since the VH1 Heart special. One thing led to another, and naturallythe result is a record of long-awaited new material that was largely unexpected to ever come about after Layne Staley's passing. Alice in Chains' legacy with the troubled, irreplaceable front man who suffered internally into unfortunate oblivion was starting to turn into a story of legend. Now it's sadly turned into a point of contention between fans of old versus new AIC.    Though lacking the band name to credit, the previously mentioned Boggy Depot and Degradation Trip sound as much as Alice in Chains as the new release in several ways. In fact the latter is every bit as impressive as Black Gives Way to Blue if not more so at times. Even without as much presence by Kinney or Inez, it still sounds even more like 'the next Alice record'. The difference between Degradation Trip and BGWTB? The band name, i.e. a stamp of approval of sorts. It's unfortunate that in order to hit a wider audience they had no choice but to stamp the AIC brand on the music. Jerry Cantrell as a solo artist, though every bit as good as Alice without Staley, is just a hard sell -- so much so that the Roadrunner made him release a condensed, single-disc version of Degradation Trip to test the waters before they would agree to print the entire two-disc compilation.  The band members can iterate and rehash every possible way their reason(s) for keeping the Alice name alive they can think of - celebration of a legacy or adding to the amazing history being the main ones they mention. But the main result of this choice, desired or not, is that it ensures that they hit a broader audience and garner more attention, and as a result get the recognition they actually deserve for their hard work.    The band members all know how iconic Staley was to the band and the risk involved with alienating fans. They all knew what a risky decision it was to continue on as Alice, including William Duvall, who admirably marches on the stage and stares down legions of dedicated fans as he growls out words he knows hecan't relate to directly in any regard on songs such as Sickman, God Am and Sludge Factory. He can't change the fact that he's not really fit to sing most of these lyrics (and I stress that no one really is), and he deserves an applause for having the guts to get up and try his best to convince us otherwise, and succeeding in many ways by digging down deep to find his own ways to relate to the lyrics and feel of the songs. I had a hunch he would be more digestible on the new record, singing fewer lyrics and melodies not formed by Staley. Surely enough, this is the case. In fact, I wish his voice was even more prominent. If I had one large complaint about this new record, the lack of presence from Duvall would be it.    So here we arrive, fittingly at the date of September 29 for the release of Black Gives Way to Blue. The fact that they are releasing it on this date speaks volumes about the band's confidence in the new material. In 1992 this date marked the start of a long journey when Alice was catapulted into mainstream success with Dirt -- a journey that took a harsh turn after essentially two straight years of nonstop touring. 17 years later, in 2009 this date marks a rebirth, and this time around they are more mature, weathered, and as a band they've changed a bit with a different bassist and obviously a huge void left by Staley. As Cantrell sings in the opening track, this is a new beginning. 17 years down the line and a lot has changed for the band and the music industry. At first you might think how it's amazing, that through all of these massive changes they can still churn out music that is still relative. That is, until you realize that all of their records are timeless, and are thus also still relative. That to me is far more impressive and makes the accomplishment of a new record sort of an afterthought. This is because Alice has always been more about making music that is focused more of being an art form than a way of 'rocking out'. This record tips the scales a little too far to the rocking out spectrum for my tastes, but more on that later.    Alice has always had a knack for having the first song on the record set the tone musically and lyrically. On Facelift they start right in with the death-aware reality check, on Dirt they lead off with hard-hitting internal despair and hopelessness, and on self-titled they had Grind, which I consider to be the song version of a meat-axe, with the riffs pounding and tearing away at flesh and bone that set the tone for an album to be a form of biting back and questioning the intentions of anyone including but not limited to God him/her/itself. All of these songs set the overall tone of their respective record pretty accurately, both sonically and lyrically. The case is no different on BGWTB. As such the first subject matter they address are all the \\"secrets\\" we know -- that they can't go back to where they were before as they are changed forever and haunted by the loss of Staley, but it's time to move on. Slowly and methodically, All Secrets Known opens the new chapter in a way that will probably shock you if you've never heard Jerry's solo albums. Still this song is sort of on the tame side for an Alice opener, which feels to me like 'yes we are back, but don't expect it to be quite the same.\\" This turns out to be pretty accurate summation of the album as a whole.    Coming off as 'now that we have that out of the way, let's get to rocking out', track two takes us right into the first single, Check My Brain. The main riff has a few strums with a bend that recall Angry Chair except with the bend on the first chord instead of the last. The melody, repetition and harmonizing show more similarities to that song, too. In short, this song sounds how it would've turned out if Jerry Cantrell wrote Angry Chair's lyrics and music instead of Staley. It turns out that it's not terrible, actually, just a bit less atmospheric and lot more radio friendly. Overall, the record is more aimed at being a loud and in-your-face rock record as opposed to focusing on overall atmosphere as on Facelift, Sap, Dirt, Jar of Flies and Tripod, which I will later explain how this hurts it when it comes to longevity. For the record I am writing this as I listen, of course.    Finally we get to the long awaited first and only song where Duvall takes lead pretty much on his own on the vocals. This is what I had personally been dying to hear and am disappointed not to hear more of. Many have said, and I can't help but agree, that this tune sounds like it was pulled right out of the Dirt sessions with the guitar grooves that sound like Dam That River was crammed together with Rain When I Die and pushed out of a cheese grater. Duvall's vocals are notably more enjoyable than Cantrell's, as he knows how to sing with more conviction. Favorite song at this point in the record.    Your Decision comes on as the first acoustic-based track and follows a very similar chord progression as Angel Eyes from Degradation Trip, but just feels like it drags itself to the finish with the help of an electric solo that anchors it. It's decent but it's not very memorable. Probably the worst song at this point in the record, and perhaps the worst one on the entire album. It's too simple and too basic. While I usually appreciate Alice's stripped down songs, this one could have benefitted from stronger, more convincing lead vocals. Imagine a song like Nutshell being sang by Cantrell. It wouldn't be excellent. When a song is stripped down it needs stronger vocals to contrast the lighter music.    Next up is A Looking in View, which was actually the first song released from the new record via the band's website, and I can't help but hear this and think 'this is almost how Died would have sounded if it was actually finished.' It's in the same direction, vibe and pace, but with more polish and completion. It's a little bit too long for the lack of complexity it offers, but it's one of the better songs despite this.     At this point in the record, I have realized that this new material misses Staley's lyrical complexity just as much as it misses his actual vocals. No more of those long-drawn interruptions we got on tunes like Sludge Factory or Frogs, or even smack in the middle of songs like Sickman and A Little Bitter. But more noticeably lacking is how the overall verse lyrics miss quality and diversity in terms of both melody and content. Those are minor complaints though, as with either more atmosphere or a larger role from Duvall, this album could have been even better than Dirt.    Back to the songs. When the Sun Rose Again is another acoustic number that has the ambiance of Sap more than Jar of Flies with Kinney on the bongos. This mood caters to Cantrell's vocal style very well. As perhaps the best acoustic song on here it just so happens to lead right into the best electric song -- Acid Bubble. With an opening lick that echoes shades of Bleed the Freak, the pace plods along much like Frogs. This song is both the fastest and slowest song on the record. Fastest in a literal sense and also because good songs always seem to end when you were still wanting more. My favorite AIC vibes are all touched upon here -- the meticulous chord progressions of self-titled, the off-kilter tempo changes of Dirt and the best harmonizing on the entire record.    Unfortunately it's hard to follow up an amazing song like that, but Lesson Learned actually does a decent job. It has that catchy sound that you would expect to find on Cantrell's solo records. It's a great song, it's just not what you would expect from an AIC album. It doesn't really deserve a knock for that. Finally we're getting towards the end and Cantrell is the one who's complaining that 'time is dragging on' on Take Her Out. By the end of this song I must admit that I share his sentiments. Like the first acoustic track, this song could really do well with better lead vocals. Where the heck has Duvall gone? He's supposed to be the new front man and he's been basically absent on the last two songs that really could've used him. I bet these two songs (Take Her Out and Lesson Learned) are better live, seeing how Duvall's usually more take-charge in that setting.    Private Hell finally brings a sigh of relief as I thought this record was about to spiral downhill after a solid start. Duvall is back into the mix again as he sings backup on the verses and lead on the choruses. It delivers a sledgehammer to the skull with its layering, and really shows the band's potential.    The final song is an acoustic goodbye to Layne Staley. With Elton John lending a hand or two on the piano, it's one of the most beautifully depressing songs in the AIC catalogue. While we've known Layne's been gone for such a long time, this song really makes the unfortunate reality set in, and in a hard way. It really has that cementing effect to it -- just imagine being in an elevator going up that suddenly breaks and starts to fall fifty floors. It reminds me of why I loved Alice in the first place: their music deals with reality, and reminds you that often times reality sucks, and somehow it's comforting to know that it doesn't just suck for yourself.    While people still dispute (and probably will until the world ends) about replacing Staley and/or continuing on as Alice, they're overlooking the only truly important question they should focus on: does the new record stand up to other Alice records? This should be the question asked regardless of whether Staley was in the band or not. When you look at both sides of the equation that made them so great in the first place -- the powerful singing and song writing duo with now half of this gone, the answer is no. It does stand up well to the other Jerry Cantrell records, however. In fact I would say Degradation Trip gets closer to meeting AIC standards than BGWTB, though it still falls a bit short.    That said, there is something undeniably absent on this record much like its cousin, Degradation Trip. As I mentioned earlier it's missing an overall atmosphere due to too much emphasis on being purely loudness of rock. Stripping down the music to a certain point and contrasting it with powerful vocals helps give a record an overall vibe and pulse. This is something they could've accomplished better if Duvall was used more. It's too bad they didn't use his vocal prowess to their full advantage.    When I close my eyes and listen to Dirt it takes me into a nightmarish doomsday, or self-titled takes me into a roller coaster of whimsical mood swings. Each AIC release prior to this had a definable artistic sonic identity, where if you had to, you could listen to one song from each record and easily figure out which one it came from based on its feel. This record suffers from an identity crisis in comparison, these identities are what gave previous Alice works their long-lasting appeal, and also the artistic appeal. Some days I'm feeling into the Staley-induced mood swings and attitude of self-titled, other days the hopelessness of Dirt and Sap, or infrequently the funkier attitude of Facelift, and for some occasions the semi-uplifting ambiance of Jar of Flies.     Think of it in the same ways as looking at paintings -- they all have a mood and pure emotion attached to them. I don't ever see myself 'feeling like Black Gives Way to Blue' for these emotionally therapeutic motivations. This record lacks that type of identity or heart that makes an album have a life of its own inside your head, as does Degradation Trip. Ironically a heart is the image on the cover (maybe saying they wear their heart on their sleeve, seems rather cliche to me). It turns out that a heart is what seems to be mostly absent on the inside of the case. While it still gets my recommendation, it will be a long time, or possibly never before I am willing to say that Black Gives Way to Blue has the long lasting effect of any of the other Alice in Chains releases.     When it comes down to it, they made a great piece of music, but a so-so piece of art. What they have is the Alice in Chains shell without the heart and soul that really catapulted them into a truly one-of-a-kind group. To quote T.S. Eliot's poem The Hollow Men, they have \\"shape without form, shade without colour.... gesture without motion.\\"     To compare it to sports, it's like watching Michael Jordan when he came back to play for the Wizards. He showed he was still MJ at times by using his veteran savvy to make viewers and opponents ooooh and awwww, but when it came down to it he just wasn't his airness anymore. It was gratifying to see him back as Jordan, but also gut-wrenching to watch him when he was disadvantaged, knowing how truly great he once was. This is precisely my feeling towards Alice in Chains returning with their name in tact. I cannot be more glad that they are here but find it incredibly hard to stomach at the same time.    More so artistically than musically, Staley was to Alice in Chains as Freddie Mercury was to Queen. You don't have one without the other, and you can't convince a large group of people otherwise. What they do have is a very, very good emulation of Alice that at times might fool you into thinking it's the real deal with their aforementioned Michael Jordan-like veteran savvy, even in the new writing you might think it's the real deal. In a sense what they have is the ultimate Alice in Chains 'cover band'. That's not intended as a sleight at what they've recorded here or what they're doing, but it's just the reality of the situation. And facing reality, even when it's unbearably hopeless to the point where you think life is going to be over (in this case the life of the band), is what Alice in Chains is all about -- with or without Layne Staley physically present. Whether they're doing this to  'honor the legacy', or as they consistently put it as 'playing the songs we all love', all they're doing is what they canwith what they have available. What it really is, is a classic case of  'taking lemons and making lemonade.' Truly this is the case, because the taste left in my mouth over the new material is a little sweet while a little sour, and perhaps even 'a little bitter.'
B002BFBAWO|4.0|I expected this film to be just another silly teen comedy, but 'Adventureland' is a much more serious film than I expected. That's not to say it's without any laughs. The film has an excellent cast who all can handle comedy and drama well. I have only seen Eisenberg in a few films, but he shows he is an interesting and capable actor. I liked this film very much and its charming run down amusement park setting with a cool 80's soundtrack will certainly spark memories for those of us old enough to remember those times.

B002HNA95E|4.0|Madonna has previously released 2 greatest hits sets, 1990's Immaculate Collection, and 2001's GHV2. (You can also throw in 1995's Something To Remember as a hits collection of sorts.) But now comes \\"Celebration\\" (incidentally the last release Madonna was contractually obliged to Warner Records). First things first: this is being released as both a single CD release, and as a \\"deluxe\\" 2CD release. It's immediately clear that the 2CD package is the way to go if you want to get a full overview of Madonna's 27+ year career (and counting).<br /><br />\\"Celebration\\" (2CDs; 36 tracks; 157 min.) is a fabulous overview of Madonna then-and-now (it includes 2 new tracks, the title track and \\"Revolver\\", the latter one not being on the single CD compilation). Would anyone who has The Immaculate Collection and GHV2 CDs be interested in this? Interesting question. 16 of the 17 tracks from the Immaculate Collection are on here, and rightfully so (only \\"Rescue Me\\" is not on here). Several tracks from GHV2 are on here too, but since that compilation was issued in 2001, this brings an updated overview with Madonna's biggest and best tracks since then such as \\"Die Another Day\\", \\"Hung Up\\", and \\"4 Minutes\\", just to name those. In the end, \\"Celebration\\" is a better overview than a collated Immaculate Collection/GHV2 would be, and for that reason alone, this is worth having. That said, I can't help but notice that several huge hits from Madonna's illustrious career are not included on here, such as \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\" and \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\". But at 157 min., this 2CD collection is pretty much maxed out as it is, and what other tracks would one leave off?<br /><br />The sequencing and arguing about whether such-and-such track could've or should've been included aside, this is one stellar collection of music, and a true statement to Madonna's incredible staying power. Hearing the old tunes next to the newer ones (as this compilation is not chronological) such as going from \\"4 Minutes\\" to \\"Holiday\\" on CD1 or \\"Who's That Girl\\" to \\"Frozen\\" on CD2 only re-emphasizes how timeless Madonna has been and has become. It just amazes you. Bottom line, this 2CD \\"Celebration\\" is the ultimate Madonna overview, done right, for the casual Madonna fan (if there is such a thing).\\" to \\"Holiday\\" on CD1 or \\"Who's That Girl\\" to \\"Frozen\\" on CD2 only re-emphasizes how timeless Madonna has been and has become.

B002KVSJ64|5.0|3 years after \\"Phobia\\" released, they come out with \\"Dear Agony\\". And just let me tell you, they havn't lost their touch. This album has it all. Soft melody, angry screams, great sound, interesting guitar solos. I will admit. I was worried. I thought this album was totally gonna suck. I'm so glad that It don't. They really havn't changed there sound too much. Still the same band I remember. A lil heavier than phobia. \\"Hopeless\\" is a great song. One of my favorites. \\"Fade Away\\" is the opening track and its a good way to start off the new album. Crawl is the best off the album. Anthem of the Angels is pretty good tune to sing along with. You wont be dissappointed with this album. Very good. Ben did very good on this one. I'm a happy camper

B001FB4VZS|3.0|First of all, considering this is the eighth season of a show, it's pretty remarkable that the writers have managed to still pen a decent script from a near empty pool of source material. Not to say the Superman mythos is lacking girth in any way, but creating story arcs that pertain to the pre-superman days are really going to start to stretch, more so than they already are, if they really want to stick to the superman-without-a-cape angle for too much longer. Eventually, if the show manages to survive that long, they are just going to have to inevitably take that plunge, but I digress.    Like I said in the title, when the show this season stays focused on the main plot, it's, in my honest opinion, one of the best seasons yet. However, when it strays from the plot, for example any episode that featured Lana Lang in it, the writing was close to terrible and that character in particular seemed really out of place and unnecessary for any part of the story arc. Same goes for Lex's character. Although, a return would always be welcome as the main villain for the series, it just didn't fit at all with Lex Luther being only a side enemy rather than the real threat of the season.     In any case, I gave this season a 3 out of 5 stars. The main plot was dark, gritty, a little disturbing, and definitely the bloodiest season yet, but very well written.     On that note, I would like to mention that if you enjoy watching the series with your younger children, I would consider taking a pass on this season. The content of this season is much more mature than that of pervious seasons, and there may be too much adult appropriate content for younger viewers (read: 12 and younger) to handle.

1401323820|5.0|As a work of literature, \\"Heat Wave\\" is a sensational success. The story is written with an appropriate tone and just the right balance of wit and accuracy. The information pertaining to the case is appropriately crisp and matter-of-fact while the relationships and interactions between people are genuine and human. The characters are well-developed without being too overbearing or distracting from the woven crime cases. Even a character like Jameson Rook, who is exasperating and arrogant on the best of days, is given just the right amount of human qualities to endear him to the audience. The reader will care about the characters and read eagerly for the solution to the crime.<br /><br />As an adjunct to the ABC comedy crime drama \\"Castle,\\" \\"Heat Wave\\" hits the mark as the creative work of Richard Castle. Fans of the show will recognize his wit and humor in the prose as well as the inclusion of his experiences with the NYPD and Detective Kate Beckett into the story. The characters and their relationships are perfect mirrors to those that Richard Castle experiences with his ride-along at twelfth precinct which makes it an easy transition for fans of the show. ABC has gone to greater lengths than any network I've ever seen to provide their fans with something interactive that directly ties into the show. Far beyond \\"breaking the fourth wall,\\" this book pushes the limit of the artistic world meeting the \\"real world.\\" Fans will feel like they are sharing the experience with their favorite characters from \\"Castle\\" by laying their hands on Richard Castle's first Nikki Heat novel.
0312330537|1.0|While there might be some who rave about this being the greatest novel they've ever read, I have to wonder what are the other novels they've read.  This isn't even, by far, the best book written about contemporary Mumbai, or Bombay, however you refer to the city. The book is a long-winded ode to violence, with Bombay and other locales (Goa, Afghanistan) as an exotic setting for a mafia tale.  The author does create some interesting characters: unfortunately, they are not a lot of the main ones, and the weak spot is the narrator himself, and the Harlequin romance quality prose that accompanies his odes to various loved ones, or descriptions of nature, or Marine Drive during evening, or a kabob stand on Chowpaty Beach, or any one of his male friends in the slums, at Juhu Beach, ad nauseum. Mr. Roberts attempts at metaphor, figurative language and narrative description by and large flounder miserably, leaving the reader feeling vaguely unwell.  And it usually accompanies all passages having to do with his paramour Karla, so a few hundred pages into the book, everytime her name is uttered the reader cringes, bracing themself for more turgid love prose.    He does a decent job of capturing the flavor of Mumbai, from Colaba up to Juhu, VT, back Bay, Marine Drive and other spots, though Sukhetu Mehta's non-fiction \\"Bombay Maximum City\\" is miles ahead of it. The plot is a continuous mob brawl, so it is ironic that the author portrays himself as a good guy whom everybody loves, when he spends most of his time slicing and dicing his way through the city, setting up smack deals, dealing in phony passports.  Its a melodrama with a terminally flawed hero - he can't even muster up much of a love for Karla until well into the book.  With all of the glowing accounts of men fighting, brave gangsters, his love for Khaderbai, was I the only one who detected more than a faint theme of homoeroticism in the book?  And if he reminded us once more about his ability to speak BOTH Marathi and Hindi I was going to vomit.   Did anyone edit this book?  If they did, I shudder to think what it read like before.    Oh, and the philosophizing .... \\"The universe tends towards ever-increasing complexity\\". That sums up the many pages of philosophy in the book....I soon began to skim these pages.  I knew well into the book what would be the final outcome regarding Khader and Karla.  Like a lot of action movies, Roberts piles on pages and detaisl to try to get the reader to forget about what obviously will happen.      There are much better novels about India, written by Indians - Ghosh, Mistry, Rushdie, and many others.  Trudging through this epic (it should be a TV miniseries starring Richard Chamberlain) left me longing for the oeuvre of Shoba De...

In reality it was an event that was charged with emotion for Joe Bonamassa, his band, his family but also for his fans, many of whom had travelled from all over the world to be there. This DVD records perfectly, the emotion of that night and thanks to Kevin Shirley's wizardry, the sound mix improves on the live sound experienced by many in a hall that is not renouned as being good for this type of event.

B001PA0FFO|5.0|I am beginning to wonder if there is any movie in which Philip Seymour Hoffman does not excel. Sames goes for Meryl Streep. Streep plays Sister Aloysius, feared principal of a Catholic school during the mid 60's. Sister James, played by Amy Adams, witnesses what she thinks may be inappropriate behavior between Father Flynn (Hoffman) and the school's only black student. Sister Aloysius, feeling threatened by the priest's progressive thinking and harboring a deep dislike for him, is intent on proving the priest has committed a crime against the boy. Flynn, however, insists he is merely trying to protect this young black student from the other students and a father who continually beats him. The conflict between the nun and the priest is intense and fierce and well-done with Sister James nervously hovering in the background, unsure who to believe.     These three actors turn in fine performances in an intriguing movie. Another actor who plays a small part but does it so well is Viola Davis, who plays the black student's mother. Her few minutes on-screen are poignant and powerful and could not have been done any better.
B000HKWCOA|1.0|I've always been a fan of Star Trek, from the original series, but I thought Enterprise was just awful. I think it started with the guy they chose for the captain. He is not a good actor and to the extent he has any talent its much better suited to comedy than action adventure. The rest of the cast was also mediocre. Most of the stories just made me grown they had so many holes in the plot or were so contrived and predictable.

0449227421|4.0|Ken Follett's \\"The Third Twin\\" is the first time I read Ken Follett's book and I must say that I wasn't disappointed. This book addresses nature vs. nurture fact. It doesn't matter what nature gave you, but what matters is how you have been nurtured and raised up. And it is Jeannie Ferrami, the central character in this book, a young professor at JFU, who is investigating the balance of nature vs. nurture in criminality.<br /><br />As part of her research, Jeannie finds Steve Logan has an identical twin - who has been raised apart & the twins have never ever met. Plus, these twins are born to different mothers and on different dates! I kind of liked Steve a lot because of the way he behaves & is honest.<br />In the meanwhile, Jeannie's friend Lisa was raped. And Steve is arrested for raping Lisa. Jeannie is totally confused! To dig out the rapist, Jeannie is in for the biggest surprise of her life. And Steve helps Jeannie too in order to remain out of the jail and get acquitted in rape charge.<br /><br />What I really liked about \\"The Third Twin\\" is the mystery factor and also the way in which it has been written. The story completes in a week - it begins on a Sunday and the mystery solves by next Monday.<br /><br />Well written and the story flows - there are no abrupt beginnings and abrupt ends. Go ahead - grab a copy of this book to read.

That is rare for Jane Austen movies, which are usually quite predictable but we love seeing how it all unfolds anyway. Now I can watch this movie over and over and still love it!
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|I bought this copy of Dexter for my aunt, who said after the first episode that it was funny, but too gory for her.  And it is gory.  Dexter is a serial killer who is also a blood spatter expert, so there's a lot of blood in the lives of both the good and the bad Dexter.  It had been while since I'd watched the first season, and the mood is certainly darker and less whimsical than it eventually grows to be.  But oh, it's bad so good!  The voiceover by Michael C. Hall just makes this show for me, and the supporting characters are a treat to watch, especially Sgt. Doakes, who can work more expletives into a single sentence than I thought possible.      My only frustration with the DVD, and it was a big enough one to reduce this review by one star, was that though the packaging says that there is closed captioning, we were not able to find a way to turn it on in the menu.  Also this DVD set doesn't have much in the way of extras, if you're into that, but for me, the show itself was treat enough.
0345472322|1.0|i wish i had the last 3 hours of my life back - this book could have been abridged to one page without any devaluation.  the author's central premise is intriguing and definitively convincing, but unfortunately, the book goes downhill from there.  i was expecting even the faintest hint of actual psychological/scientific evidence to buttress the thesis but unfortunately received 250 pages of hodge-podge anecdotes more befitting of Teen People magazine.  to say this book was repetitive is a gracious understatement - the author proffers nothing even slightly resembling novel insight past the opening introduction.      this book is basically an anti-intellectual fluff piece targeted for the lowest common denominator.  not my cup of tea.

B000AP04OM|5.0|Probably the most beloved musical of all time. Love it! I used to want to be Louisa and wanted to marry the Captain...that would be bad though. And there's a line you can live your life by in it, \\"When the Lord closes a door, He always opens a window.\\" That Maria is so wise.
B002GU605G|5.0|Love has been one of my favorite albums for twenty + years. As I grew older though, I became less and less impressed with the production levels. This really brings a full sound as it was always meant to be heard. The sound doesn't stop at the album itself either, it is consistent through the singles, and the live set is great too.    If you've ever loved this album, the upgrade is well worth it, one of the few upgrades of this type that really delivers. If you've never heard it, this is an incredible introductory set to the Cult.
B001U891HE|4.0|This is the whole works of Shakespeare for one dollar, and there is a table of contents. Just press \\"previous page\\" when the book first comes up on your kindle.  My only complaint is that the history plays are not sequential in the TOC. Still, a great deal by any reasonable standard.

B002BFBAWO|5.0|ADVENTURELAND is Greg Mottola's directorial follow-up to SUPERBAD  But it's not a laugh-out-loud comedy, despite the facts that Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig are on hand as park managers and the lead character keeps getting hit in the balls by the annoying childhood friend he can't quite shake off.  It's a movie Kristen Stewart shot before TWILIGHT.  But this time around, she's not falling for a dark, mysterious and brooding hero.<br /><br />What is ADVENTURELAND?  It's a charming, well-acted, intelligently written and highly enjoyable coming-of-age story set at a 1980s amusement park.<br /><br />Jesse Eisenberg gives a fine performance as James Brennan, the virginal, insecure, awkwardly intelligent college grad who takes a summer job at Adventureland when his parents' financial troubles force him to cancel his European summer plans.  Kristen Stewart shines as Em, the girl he falls for but who happens to be involved with the park's married maintenance guy.  Stewart makes her character believably screwed up, both in her home life and in how she compartmentalizes and balances her dueling summer relationships.  Meanwhile, Ryan Reynolds makes Mike, the maintenance guy, a tightly wound bundle of emotions, playing him as an aging town stud who understands that while most of the young people who surround him may enjoy a summer of fun, games and meaningless rides, he's the only one who'll be doing it all again next summer.<br /><br />There's a great supporting cast and a fun '80s soundtrack, too.<br /><br />So don't expect SUPERBAD.  But if you do go along for the ride, be prepared to for something super good.
B0029LHW4U|4.0|When someone told me that Alice In Chains got back together to play a re-union tour a couple of years back my initial thought was: Is Jerry Cantrell going to take over the lead spot? Well, sorta. Jerry and Layne were sorta like dual lead vocalists- Layne doing most of the vocalizations.   Anyone with any sorta background on the band knows this much. But when I heard they found someone else in the band- it felt initially like blasphemy to me. So, being somewhat of an optimist- and liking Jerry Cantrell's last solo record ALOT- I figured it's gotta be along those lines.   Obviously- the record has a lot of Cantrell's personality but collectively it contains all the personalities of the band- it feels like a Alice In Chains disc. The disc starts off with the introspective & brooding track \\"All Secrets Known\\"- not quite the rocking number but slow moving & creepy begining to a more FaceLift-esque sounding \\"Check My Brain\\". \\"Last Of My Kind\\" is the song where new-comer William Duvall makes his mark- a slightly more straight forward track but never lacking in heaviness- doesn't feel at all out of place on the disc. \\"Your Decision\\"- feels like the albums softer moments- but contains sorta the laid back vibe of Jar Of Flies. \\"A Looking in View\\" & the monstorous riffing of \\"Acid Bubble\\" sound like classic AIC- weird eerie harmonies & weird time changes & heavy guitars. Indeed, as a whole the record feels like a bit of the span of their entire career on one disc with tastes of what's to come- Particularly how ambitious & layered the instrumentation is on the disc- not just the left & right guitar doubling- but odds and ends- and nuances. Overall- it's a decent disc- that is still growing on me. Worthy of picking up...  PS- I forgot to mention the title track \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\"- a very gutsy way to end an album methinks (closing the record on a lull) but ending the disc like this seems to feel right. It also helps that the closer seems to be a tribute to their fallen brother Layne Staley. Another interesting side note is Elton John playing a little piano on this track- apparently the first show Layne attended was an Elton John show. I'm wondering if this was intentional or pure coincidence. Either way- it's just long enough of a song to say what it has to say...
1878424602|5.0|I carry this little book of wisdom with me everywhere today, and have for the last three months now.    A very wise woman recommended \\"The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success\\" to me, and I am glad she did.    The only thing I could object to, if I had to; is the title; because the words LAW and SUCCESS might give the wrong associations, - because of the way those words are used or, abused, in the world - otherwise I think this little book is flawless, fascinating, simple and...true.   A treasure of wisdom the way Nature would write itself on paper.  I read it, like some people \\"read\\" nature, over and over again, and discover a multitude of different truths about life every time I do.    L. Holm author

B001FB4W0C|5.0|This is an amazingly well-written and thought-provoking show exploring religious and familial themes wrapped up in humor and paranormal drama. It's a testament to the talent of all those involved [actors, writers, directors, producers, crew, etc.] that this cult-hit keeps being engrossing in it's 4th season and not stale or trite. As a huge Supernatural fan, I couldn't be more pleased with Season 4, though with it's DVD release it proves the show is almost at it's zenith---a disheartening fact for fans.    Per usual Kripke, Ackles, Padalecki and Co. leave viewers hearts-pounding and mouths-dropping with tense scenes of brotherly discord set against the backdrop of impending doom on a global-scale. If you've never seen an episode of this show, get on the train, start from Season 1 and be enthralled by the character development and intriguing story-arc set on a 5-year timeline. The content of the show has grown so much in 4 years, that \\"newbies\\" can't start with this season. But, for fans of the show who've been watching from the beginning, get this DVD set and revel in the awesomeness of Sam and Dean, and Kripke's twisted imagination, one more time. Enjoy!

0757302661|3.0|This book is not bad but I did expect a little more training on preparing myself for labor. The book does share techniques on how to relax and breathe during labor but I have a feeling when the pain comes at full force that these techniques won't be that helpful.
1416594787|5.0|I loved this book, I have read everyone of Richard Dawkins' books, and this perhaps him at his best. I really, learned a lot from this book, and what I learned with the biochemistry of evolution, which I was sadly not that learned upon.  I also liked how Dawkins finally wrote about human evolution, his other books seemed to only hint at it, and is great to have a book such as this, which can give good talking-points for those who are trying to defend evolution against the cavemen of \\"creationism\\".    I also would encourage everyone on here, to write a letter of complaint to amazon.com, about the Reed Business review. Lehrer is a terrible writer, I have read his book about the neurological process involving choice, and he really has a complete lack of understanding concerning evolution.  I take issue with his view, that Dawkins should tone down his voice, so that he can reach more people. It is quite clear that he has not read Dawkins book, because, if he had he would realize that Dawkins is tired of having to defend a theory which has been tested over and over again.  This is not the first time, that Reed, has written reviews for books, which are really lacking and seem to miss the whole premise of the book.
0525421033|5.0|\\"I hear a crash and a boom coming from upstairs.  Teddy is pounding on his drum kit.  It use to belong to Dad.  Back when he'd played drums in a big-in-our-town, unknown-anywhere-else band, back when he worked at a record store.<br />\\"Dad grins at Teddy's noise, and seeing that, I feel a familiar pang.  I know it's silly but I have always wondered if Dad is disappointed that I didn't become a rock chick.  I'd meant to.  Then, in third grade, I'd wandered over to the cello in music class -- it looked almost human to me.  It looked like if you played it, it would tell you secrets, so I started playing.  It's been almost ten years now and I haven't stopped.\\"<br /><br />In Mia's family, \\"playing music was still more important than the type of music you played,\\" so Mia's unending hours and years of practicing sonatas and suites is not an issue with her parents or their aging punker friends.  Mia has been raised amongst a quilt of extended family and familial friends in rural Oregon.<br /><br />Nor is her submergence in classical music an impediment to her relationship with Adam.  An emo-core guitarist with a hot, local band, Adam fell for Mia's passionate playing a couple of years earlier, while watching her in the music wing at school, and then spent two weeks worth of his pizza delivery tips on their first date -- tickets for a nearby Yo-Yo Ma concert.  Adam's a guy for us to really like.<br /><br />This being Oregon, there is a bit of underlying tension between Mia and Adam over the future.  Mia has totally nailed her audition for admittance to Julliard in Manhattan.  Being that they are riding their own rising trajectory, Adam and his Shooting Star bandmates are certainly not going to suddenly pick up and move east.<br /><br />And so it stands, on the lightly snowy morning that Mia and her family depart for a day of visiting and die in a horrific automobile accident.  That is, they all die except for Mia, who finds herself wandering about in an out-of-body state while her body lies in grave condition, in a coma, undergoing a series of operations and lying for hours all wired up in ICU while that quilt of supporters root for her to stay.<br /><br />IF I STAY takes place over the twenty-four hours that follow the accident.  Being that the accident takes place at the beginning of the book, we are moved back and forth throughout the story between the present -- as Mia considers what to do -- and the past as she tells of her life to this point.<br /><br />Will Mia stay or choose to check out?<br /><br />While there is some very cool stuff here about family, friendship, and love, IF I STAY is really an ode to the power of music.  Thinking about Mia's story causes me to recall all the times I have been moved by and forever remember a great live performance, of all the instances when hearing a song has immediately transported me back into that time in my life when it was playing over and over on the radio, of all those times I have reached for a song to help me celebrate when I'm jazzed, lend me solace when I'm low, or remember someone special from the past with whom I used to share music.  Despite knowing better at my age, I still sometimes feel like nobody can possibly be as moved by the opening notes of an old, favorite song to the extent that I am.<br /><br />And I'm betting that Mia feels the same.tion, in a coma, undergoing a series of operations and lying for hours all wired up in ICU while that quilt of supporters root for her to stay.

B002GU5V24|5.0|Well, pre-order complaints can now fall by the wayside in favor of ACTUAL listening reports ....    This set is awesome, easily my favorite of the four Genesis box set re-releases.  Athough they could have been more extensive, the extras on this set are nice, particularly if you had been hoping for the eventual release of the classic 1973 Rainbow Theater show.  But extras are not the reason to buy this set, glorious sound quality is! All four of the major albums are transformed, with improvements being more significant with the older albums. Genesis Live, for example, has gone from muddy and over-processed, to a dynamic, crystal-clear record that captures the power and brilliance of the early days of the band. The 2-channel versions are very nice, but if you have the gear, the 5.1 channel alternatives are amazing.  My only sore point with this set is that Three Sides Live is not offered here in surround.    There is an empty slot for Live Over Europe, as the view was that most fans would have recently bought it and should not be asked to so again since it had not been remixed or remastered.    This is a great set!
B00129H7VS|5.0|Absolutely fantastic.  I love this mini series of World War II. I will enjoy for years to come. It's a classic.

B000003JDO|5.0|Since this is Jethro Tulls' magnum opus, the basic content here needs no introduction. Certainly Ian Anderson is one of the best songwriters around, and  also deserves praise for having captured a particularly magical strand of the English spirit.  If you were only to get one Tull album, this would be it.   Anderson's songwriting technique is more imaginative and dexterous than most other's.  His colleagues are certainly among the most plainly professional in rock.  Regarding the sound, there are some details that are now audible that weren't before.  The acoustics of the overlarge recording space are still a bit of a problem but we are already used to them.  The extra content on the CD is a little redundant but it is extra content.  The interview is particularly welcome; Anderson seems quite coherent, a rarity in Rock music, and personable as well.  Is he really a Rock musician, or just a multi-talented music theater guy who chose a particular path?  He, one of the best singing musicians in Rock, very magnanimously quotes Rolling Stone's ultra-ignorant remarks about his alleged limitations as a singer; one wonders whether such magnanimity is even perceivable at RS, which is more of a political rag nowadays than any kind of musical journal.   If Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin got a bee in his bonnet because Anderson spoke out of turn while unaware of Plant's text-writing, it seems from this interview that he has made his apology permanent, and apologies don't get better than that - Mr. Plant, are you listening?  If there were any chance these two guys could get together, at this point it seems unlikely it would be Anderson's fault if they didn't.  What would make sense would be for the boxed sets to now start coming out... Anderson and his chums have produced quite a lot of material in his career.  It would be a good way to get all that other, less well known music known to the boxed-set-buying generation.   There is so very much of it.

0812971825|5.0|I sank into this book like I would a couch of silk-covered down cushions. I savored word-by-word the life of Reverend Tyler Caskey as he takes up his first church  in a small Vermont town. He brings his somewhat innocent faith and doctrine of total love and acceptance to his flock which embraces him whole-heartedly. They were less enthusiastic about his young wife, Laura, however.<br /><br />The omniscient narrator writes, \\"He had married a summer girl. Almost never- plenty of people would have told you this-was that a good idea. He and married a summer girl from Massachusetts, and that alone brought complications.\\" But when Laura dies shortly after the birth of their second daughter, Caskey slowly crumbles beneath the weight of his grief, the challenge to his faith, and the demands of being a single father. His congregation responds to his stress by exhibiting their own flaws. Through the ensuing struggle, we are introduced to wonderful characters whose minds we enter with incredible ease and whose voices are clearly individual.<br /><br />Abide with Me is Strout's second book and follows Amy and Isabelle (2000), a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award. Her new book, Olive Kittredge, is getting rave reviews as well and I look forward to reading it. For writers, Abide with Me provides an excellent opportunity to study two elements of craft: writing from the omniscient point-of-view and development of fallible yet sympathetic characters.<br /><br />Peggy Tabor Millin, author of Women, Writing, and Soul-Making<br />[...]

B0029LHW4U|5.0|You know the story by now: Hard-rock heroes Alice in Chains help forge a new sound for the 1990's, inspiring countless bands in their wake, only to disintegrate before the end of the decade, citing typical rock-star excess and drama (see: drug abuse). Any chance of a meaningful reunion is seemingly squashed when frontman Layne Staley is found dead of a heroin overdose in April of 2002, after falling off the face of the Earth completely. That is, until the surviving members -- Jerry Cantrell, Mike Inez and Sean Kinney - reunite in 2005, acquiring new vocalist William DuVall (Comes With The Fall) the following year, and do enough touring to decide that, yes, an Alice in Chains reunion is worth it and a new album is in order.<br /><br />\\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" has a big task at hand: Retain a signature sound while re-establishing the band as a force to be reckoned with, in spite of losing their iconic singer. Ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to announce that not only do Alice in Chains accomplish that goal, but that they are back and much bigger and better than one could have ever expected. With producer Nick Raskulinecz (Foo Fighters, Stone Sour) in tow, Cantrell and company have managed to produce an album that sounds exactly like themselves and is as bold and fresh as anything they have done in their career. The sludgy-riffs, dominant rhythm section and the haunting harmonized vocals are all in place and make for a signature Alice in Chains experience. If fourteen years between albums was too much to bear, rest assured, this album does its best to make up for lost time.<br /><br />Without a doubt, guitarist/vocalist Jerry Cantrell has taken his rightful spot as frontman on this album, following the loss of Staley. While many may fear that this new incarnation of Alice in Chains is simply a re-dressed version of Cantrell's solo career, it's anything but. The first couple of songs are pure Cantrell/old-school Alice in Chains, but when William DuVall comes through on \\"Last of My Kind,\\" a classic is born and a singer that more than fills the shoes is established. Fact of the matter is, not only is this NOT a solo Cantrell affair, but that DuVall is more than worthy of filling the position left vacant. Likewise, Inez and Kinney are still up to snuff and add the extra weight that always nailed home the best Alice in Chains songs.<br /><br />Thankfully for longtime fans and purists alike, the album pays as much tribute to the band's past as it paves a new path. The first single, \\"Check My Brain\\" is exactly the kind of hard-driving hard-rock that Alice in Chains were known for (see: \\"Facelift\\") while \\"Your Decision\\" and \\"When the Sun Rose Again\\" echo back to the \\"Jar of Flies\\" and \\"Sap\\" glory-days. Oh, and who could forget Elton John, who makes an appearance behind the piano on the title track? The most somber moment of the album, the closing number seemingly pays tribute to and closes the door on Layne Staley in a rather bittersweet and appropriate fashion.<br /><br />The song-writing is there and the musicianship is top-notch, as is the production. From front to back, there isn't a bad song to be found and even the most jaded and loyal fans of Staley will have to concede that it more than lives up to its name. Alice in Chains aren't trying to re-live glory days with this album, but it's certainly an extension of them. If you thought they were dragging the name out to make a quick buck, you better guess again. \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" means business and is about the biggest and baddest rock album you'll come across these days, proving what we always knew: Alice in Chains were one of the best things to happen to rock, not just in the `90's, but in general.d,\\" a classic is born and a singer that more than fills the shoes is established.

B0024FAR5M|5.0|I will only say that those of you having problems with the series need to give it a try again on DVD when it first aired on FX I didn't hate the show exactly I just felt that there was a lot of wasted space.  The one annoying thing that FX shows always seem to do is go through great length to try to prove to us that these bad people really aren't all that bad....and then have them do a really despicable thing its confusing who exactly are we supposed to root for here?      There are no real \\"bad\\" episodes there are episodes that are ones we have all seen before except we were on the side of law enforcement that time like \\"Fun Town\\" where in addition to all the other stuff going on the daughter of a prominent citizen is assaulted the father frustrated with the lack of action on the part of Charming's police force goes to the Sons for their own brand of justice.  Its not that I didn't like the episode but the plot line of girl getting assaulted that kicks off more action I feel is overused.  People may think I am insane but my favorite episode is #4 Patch Over where a brother club of the sons having no other alternative becomes an official character.  The clinker in this episode for me was after the vote when the Devil's Tribe who didn't want to be a part of the move rode out.  OK what do they do now?  That's why I watch FX any other network would spoon feed you everything including what happened to the now homeless Devil's Tribe.       Another confusing thing is the names of some of the characters the names of the law enforcement personnel the Captain America type named Hale who is going to clean up the town and then finds it is not as easy as all that, the chief Wayne Unser who desperately wants to maintain the peace and the character Josh Kohn the less said about this creepy stalker with a badge the better.         So remembering the names of the various law enforcement characters is not hard but some of the B class characters that don't get a lot of exposure I cannever tell apart wikipedia helps with this but I feel like something of an idiot for not remembering the differences between Juice, Tig and Chribs.         In the end you are doing yourself a disservice if you are not watching this show and you will sympathize with all of the characters even if you don't always agree with their next course of action.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Ignore all the reviews which want to nit pick this technology or that technology which should or should not have been used. If you're into listening for absolute technical perfection then go stand near a Ferrari. If you want to listen to the Beatles the way they have never sounded before on record, tape or CD then these remastered recordings are your ticket. The bottom end of Paul's bass and Ringo's drums never sounded so crisp and deep. Even on Pepper which utilized bounce tracking a 4 track machine to get the equivalent of 16 tracks sounds masterful. Bounce tracking by its very nature will muddy the lows but you would never know it on this CD. So sit back, relax and listen... a splendid time is guaranteed for all :-) BnB Beatles Depot.
B001AQTWF2|1.0|Miss Houston has paid a heavy price for her life style. As is evident to many that wonderful voice has been abused to the point that on this recording her voice is broken, off key, out of breath and volume. Yes, we can all cheer that she is brave to try a comeback - but at what price. I would rather remember the voice of the early 90s.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|After waiting for a few years after their last album, \\"Phobia,\\" it's great to finally have a new Breaking Benjamin album.     Upon first listen, I can't say I was impressed at all, except for a few songs. But after giving it a chance and listening to it a few times, it quickly grew on me and I have to say that is an incredible album. Amazing lyrics, great music. No, it's not as heavy as \\"Saturate,\\" but Ben has moved-on from Saturate and is in a different place in his life. As someone who loved \\"Phobia,\\" I love what this album has to offer. It's obviously very personal to Ben and that is evident in his lyrics.     Some of the great songs on here are: \\"Fade Away,\\" \\"Crawl,\\" \\"Anthem of the Angels,\\" \\"Lights Out,\\" \\"Dear Agony.\\"     I hope that several months from now I am in love with this album as much as I am now. Thank you, Breaking Benjamin!
B00186DV1U|3.0|\\"In the Line of Fire\\" (1993) is a fairly good thriller that will hold your interest. In his later movies Clint Eastwood seems to be specializing in playing older men who are out-of-shape, defying authority, trying to prove something to themselves and others, and who are flawed as people ( a guilt-ridden creaking geezer). In this outing he's a Secret Service agent who still feels guilty about being part of the Kennedy security detail that day in Dallas. Now, thirty years later, he's back in the presidential protective detail trying to trot alongside the limousine and barely making it.<br /> The president's chief of staff hates him because he keeps calling wolf and getting in the way. He's in conflict with one of his fellow agents. He and Agent Rene Russo are bonding though. The Secret Service boss (actor John Mahoney, he of Frazier fame) backs him until there are screw-ups.<br /> An assassin (John Malkovich) is gunning for the Prez and keeping in contact with Eastwood, teasing and taunting him with his schemes. He's one mean psychopath.<br /> I saw the movie previously and remembered it as well-done, but this time it came off rather half-baked and didn't wow me as it had the first time. Perhaps like Eastwood I'm getting old and jaded. Like the movie stars of the old days, Eastwood always seems to be playing Eastwood no matter what name he goes by in the script.
B000002ITW|4.0|The acoustic set - disk 1 - is a real pleasure to listen to. Really heartfelt. I couldn't ask for anything better. I don't think I've ever heard Neil sound this good. And on key to boot. I love his 'The Loner/Cinnamon Girl/Down By The River' medley. Crosby, Stills and Nash were stellar, as well. Simply beautiful. This is the kind of recording that requires being listened to on a good sound system. A portable mp3 player with earbuds will not allow you to appreciate the beauty of this music.  And I love the between song chit chat also. It's comical. They seemed to be enjoying each others company during these shows.    The electric set on disk 2 is a bit more problematic. The vocals seem kind of muddy to me. I would love to see this remastered again with the latest technology. That's not to say that it's bad, just that it doesn't have the clarity of the acoustic set. And their instrumentation wasn't as tight as one would hope for.    The standout track on disk 2 is 'Carry On' - all 14 minutes of it. Excellent guitar work. Amazing.    This is a timeless recording. It doesn't matter if you're 16 or 60, it's as beautiful today as it was 40 years ago. Look past the politics of the time and just enjoy the music. It's worth it.    Looking back, these guys were such kids at the time, relatively speaking. Hooray for youthful enthusiasm. I am simply in awe of these guys.
0385504225|1.0|A truly annoying book. Sheer stubborness was the only reason that I was able to slog through to the end of the book. I hated, in particular, how everyone was always \\"chuckling\\" - he/she \\"chuckled\\"; Robert/Katherine, etc. \\"said with a chuckle\\". Maybe I'm just jealous that I didn't find anything worth chuckling about in this book.
B0029LHW4U|4.0|After the sad demise of Staley, who knew if a new AIC album will see the light of day! People kinda accepted the fact that this is it for AIC! Meanwhile Cantrell had already gone solo, with Inez & Kinney. I guess it was the Tsunami Relief Concert \\"Reunion\\" in 05, that probably kindled the spark for a new beginning. I personally am happy to hear AIC doing their thing again, even though Staley ain't there no more (RiP). Mainly because AIC was among the bands that my friends & I listened to during our teen years.. (& the other 3 seattle grunge heads, Though I wouldn't consider AIC, Grunge) & after 1995's AIC Self titled, it seemed like we had to wait forever for these guys to make some more new music. Years after.. now.. we have \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" with \\"William Duvall\\" taking on vocal & rhythm section duties! I must say, Duvall is a remarkable singer, he notably hits the highs and lows that could kick any AIC fan back to Staley Land! I've listened to the whole album twice so far, & I cant help but notice how much \\"in-sync\\" Duvall is with the whole band! The Music just flows.. very little change in sound I'd say. Vocals might be an issue for many older fans here.. some think this guy tries hard to sing like Staley..  which is not true! Listen to songs from Comes With The Fall, Duvall's previous band, you'll know what I'm talking about! This is probably because Cantrell can be heard on all tracks doing the dual harmony thing. Sure Duvall has a more polished voice, minus the high pitch and Corrosion in Staley's voice (just love that, irreplaceable)! Duvall is probably one of the most underrated singers today.. thankfully for AIC, He will get the right kind of exposure required, provided Cantrell lets him do more singling! That's one of the downsides of this album, I feel its more \\"Cantrell\\" and less AIC! Best thing though, about the release of this album, IMO, is that the band took their time..  & let the fans take their time too..  to sink their teeth in to the fact that Staley is gone!<br /><br />This album has everything that made AIC a platinum selling band. Its got the acoustic songs.. its got straight up rockers, and the heaviest sounding of them all.. \\"A Looking In View\\", damn I love that track. The album starts off with \\"All Secrets Known\\" Its a tune showcasing the sound of a new beginning.. more like saying you know us, you know who we are..  you know what we do.. we've got nothing to hide.. all secrets known! I saw the video for \\"Check my Brain\\", pretty good, Inez still looks the same like 15 yrs ago, no change.. The song itself is amazing, could almost put you in a trance if heard continuously! Other straight up rockers include \\"Last of My Kind\\" and \\"Lesson Learned\\". The Tracks \\"Your decision\\" and \\"Take Her Out\\" almost sound like B Sides of Degradation Trips 1 or 2. \\"When The Sun Rose Again\\" & \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" could please the average AIC listener. The track \\"Acid Bubble\\" is AIC probably at their best, showing off their slower, darker, heavier side. \\"Private Hell\\" will remind many people of \\"Down in a Hole\\" but its an Ok track on its own. All in all a great start...  more like a re - start!! I give this album 4 stars because the music is still true to its roots and original, something you will definitely not hear in a lot of \\"NU\\" bands today!ct that Staley is gone!     This album has everything that made AIC a platinum selling band.

0345337581|5.0|I used this book 33 years ago when I did my (Irish) school Leaving Certificate exams and I got very high marks. Recently, I needed to get to grips with some very difficult information for an exam in Facilities Management, and using the systems in this book, I aced my mid term exams scoring 93% ...top of the class of 18 others. I am the oldest. So I guess you CAN teach an old dog new tricks, certainly these systems work, and anyone studying for exams should not go without this book. Any subject, and topic anywhere. This is the book.
B000Y5JFN4|5.0|Spinal Tap is a classic! One of the funniest movie of all time. On a scale of 1-10 how much I enjoyed this movie, it was an 11!
B002HNAAZ8|4.0|This is the 6th studio release from American rock band \\"Danger Danger\\". Although the group started off as a glam metal outfit like so many others in the late 80s, they consistently delivered quality albums through the unforgiving 90s while their sound took a more AOR turn. Once again the songwriting core of Bruno Ravel (B) and Steve West (D) remains intact guaranteeing the original \\"Danger Danger\\" vibe.<br /><br />This release sees the return of original vocalist Ted Poley while also marking the studio debut of Rob Marcello (\\"Marcello-Vestry\\") as the lead guitarist of \\"Danger Danger\\". It is a pleasure to hear that \\"Revolve\\" is probably the most consistent album in the band's history as the quartet has managed to keep the bar steadily high on all 11 tracks of this album.<br /><br />Despite the catchy choruses, strong harmonies and Marcello's accomplished performance, one can not help but think that \\"Revolve\\" is too much of an easy listener. You might say that's more than expected as this is AOR; still I felt that the album should include more of those heavy opening riffs and possibly a couple of aggressive songs ( similar to \\"Under the Gun\\", \\"Grind\\" and \\"Goin', Goin' Gone\\") would also fit nicely.<br />This is probably the most radio friendly album of \\"Danger Danger\\" and although it is pretty good I suspect it would have been better with Paul Laine on lead vocals. Of course the subject Poley/ Laine can generate endless conversation so I conclude that it is fascinating to see Danger Danger reformed with their original vocalist and a new guitarist who is clearly qualified to fill Andy Timmons' shoes.<br /><br />Personal favorites include \\"Ghost of Love\\", \\"Hearts on the highway\\", and \\"Rocket to your heart\\" and \\"Beautiful Regret\\".

B00127RAJY|5.0|this video is great.  It made me laugh and sweat and hate the T.V.  Each of three routines is only 20 minutes which is a plus for me.  I cannot imagine doing more than one of these in a day, but I am sure there are people out there who do.  I like that after I am done I feel accomplished and even though it may be cheating myself ;) on my off days I take a few reps off and follow Anita for the rest.

B000V86OKG|4.0|The Miami heat continues and ratchets up several notches in the sophomore season of this murderously offbeat series.  The season opens with Dexter uncharacteristically mourning his last victim--Rudy aka Brian aka the Ice Truck Killer aka his brother.  Dexter's sis, Debra, is coping with PTSD due to narrowly escaping being murdered by the Ice Truck Killer, her erstwhile fiancee.  Despite these pesky emotions, things are looking up:  Debra's not dead, and Dexter finds himself growing closer to Rita and her kids, giving lie to his own self-assessment that he's incapable of either feeling anything or caring about anyone.  But when treasure divers stumble on Dexter's body dumping site, any attempt at normalcy rapidly unravels as he finds himself on the task force in charge of investigating these heinous crimes by a monster dubbed 'The Bay Harbor Butcher'.  Dexter will need all of his carefully-honed skills and unshakable cool to throw his fellow brothers (and sister) in blue off his tail, but obscuring the evidence and hindering the investigation becomes increasingly risky with both Sgt. Doakes and FBI Special Agent Lundy (Keith Carradine) hot on his trail. Meeting a sultry and mysterious beauty (Jamie Murray) who just may be his female number jeopardizes Dexter's relationship with Rita, but Dexter recognizes a kindred spirit who understands the heady freedom in being bad.  Season One was pretty dark, but Season Two has Dexter plumbing even darker places in his twisted past as he fights for his very life.  Michael C. Hall adds layer upon layer of depth to a character he brought to unforgettable life last season.  This Dexter is both more emotional and less teddy-bearishly likeable than when we first met him, but still we root for him to succeed.  Here's hoping that Dexter will elude detection for many moons to come so we can continue to see more and more of his brilliant creator at work.
0307588335|5.0|Great bokk!!!. As european economist I have learned a lot of things about Wall Street. Thanks to Lawrence for writting this book. I have really enjoyed his book and I think all the people must read it to know some things about the crisis. Thank you very much.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Amazing.  I think someone sat Whitney and Mariah down this year and knocked some sense into the both of them.  This album is simply amazing.  Classic R&B.  If you are a R&B fan this is a MUST for you.    I am not a huge Whitney fan but I can not stop listening to this album.  Great job Whitney.  So happy you are \\"back\\"!
B001CZVVVY|5.0|I find this a superb recording of a beautiful opera. The decor is modern and sparse, focusing on your eyes on the excellent acting. This performance is so packed with emotion that I don't see what furniture would add to the experience.    As for the singing, I can't find fault with any of the performers. It's hard to point out a highlight since I really enjoy every second.    I think the extra character is a succesful experiment. His appearance drives home the morale of the opera (in my view) that even if the characters think they are in control of events, they're really being driven by forces out of their realm. His expulsion (by the original characters) at the finale is comforting to us who believe in free will.    If you feel operas are static performances that should be played in their original decor, by all means skip this rendition (or merely buy it for the sharp audio). If you enjoy a good experiment, I'm sure you'll enjoy this edition!
031606792X|1.0|I'm 37, so when my daughters got into these books, like everyone else I felt compelled to read it too but only recently.  I stood firm that I did not want to read these books- just because.  So I waited.  Even when Stephen King called the books crap, I waited.  Even after the Twilight movie came out, I liked it (sorta), but again I waited.  Well for no specific reason I decided out of nowhere to read the books and I have to say--after I've read the first 3 I honestly can't justify why I waited.  I was and am completely thrilled with how they turned out.  Not the writing so much, her style is achingly amateurish but she's a good storyteller and she has a good feel for characterization.  She makes her characters relatable at least to a certain point but given that it's an underdog/romantic triangle story you can't help but get into it and pick the pairing you relate to more.    New Moon and Eclipse are 10 hanky books for me, I cried and cried.  She really touched on what loss, acceptance, tolerance and sacrifice really feel like.  Everyone else's sacrifice that is.  Bella didn't sacrifice anything except her own sorry life every chance she got.  It's hardly a sacrifice when she values her own life as zero.    But Ms. Meyers completely lost me on the 4th book COMPLETELY.  I'm just amazingly and totally let down by this one.  I don't even know where to start but after reading some of the latest reviews I don't think I need to, everyone here (those who aren't sheep that is) spoke my mind for me.  This is an amazingly hard book to get thru.  I'm totally exhausted and I've still got 200 pages to go till I finish.  I just don't know what she could have been smoking?  I just don't know why she turned all these characters that we've grown to love into caricatures and cliches.  I don't mind that the sex scenes weren't explicit, this is not a Harlequin for goodness sake.  In fact I thought she handled that gracefully.  But while all the plot twists and turns in books 2 and 3 progressed well all thru the books; it all led up to something and when it was finished you couldn't wait to read the next.  This book fails to do that.      I will finish reading this book but at a later time.  I'm just so disappointed in this book so far I'm actually going to put it down and not finish for another week, it may take me that long to recover.  I'm so emotionally drained.  At this point I really don't see how it could improve to the point of my giving it a better rating.  It's already been eviscerated for me.     ********UPDATE********    I forgot to follow up.  Well, I did it.  I finished it!  I did put it aside like I said and wound up picking it up again three days later, I just had to find out what happened!  Even though I tried to prepare myself nothing could have prepared me for the letdown.  On reading my above review, it's a little harsh and rude but I can't in all honestly modify it.  I just don't know how she thought this was an ideal direction.  It doesn't even look like she wrote it.  It's so out there and fantastical she had everything but dancing mice and fairy godmothers.  The way she vivisected Jake, that was harsh, it was beyond harsh.  Giving him the out that she did didn't fix that for me.      I so wanted Bella to understand her actions, she never does.  I wanted Edward to be a man for once instead of whining like a bitch and do the right thing and get lost, doesn't happen, instead there's this feeling that if Bella's not with him he's gonna off himself.  That's just abusive, and I wanted Jake to grow the hell up and quit waiting on Bella to do the same.  Maybe once they've gotten their own heads out of their considerable arses maybe they could have found their way, whatever that way may have been.  But whatever that was, I wanted it to be true to the characters, true to the story and true to real life without somehow losing it's fantasy/fictional spirit.      Ms. Meyers can't expect us to believe just anything can she?  I realize this is fantasy, about werewolves and vampires no less but it's also a teenage romance story.  Meyers has gone to great lengths to show that it's not so much about the fantasy as the love.  This is a tragic love story just like Bronte and Romeo and Juliet.  Those stories are also about stupid people making lifelong stupid decisions for love.  So even though it has vampires and other legendary themes, there has been a great element of reality mixed in, or else we couldn't have become so engrossed in these books.  But suspension of disbelief only takes you so far.      A good writer, no matter the ending, has to take you on a journey.  She has to bring it to you and lead you in the right direction otherwise it's not believable.  And that's what happened here.  Meyers broke every rule, every plot device, Every One Of Her Own Laws Of Reality all so Edward could be with Bella.  YOU CAN'T DO THAT.  You can't write 3-1/2 books of how things are, and in one fell swoop disregard EVERYTHING we've all come to believe as gospel.  You just can't do that.  That's not good writing.  That's in fact - RIDICULOUS.  And your editors should have told you that!  Thanks Ms. Meyers, thanks for making me feel soooo stupid, thus reminding me of why I refused to read your books in the first place.    One star is all I'll rate this book, because I can honestly say I didn't like one storyline in the whole book.  Not one.  It's because of this book that I now refuse to read any other S. Meyers works; The Host, Midnight Sun, etc.  I simply won't allow myself to be so heartbreakingly disappointed again.    It's because of this tortuous book that I refuse to see the Breaking Dawn movies.  There's just no way I can do that to myself.  I'm sorry Ms. Meyers, but you've just lost a customer.
0385504225|5.0|I honestly do not understand the bad reviews here. People seem to have a problem with the plot, others the writing and some the characters in the book. They seem to forget that Dan Brown and the publishers never claimed that this was non-fiction. Neither did they claim that this book is factual. Remember people this is a fiction novel and a reader should take it that way. Fiction, for some people, are a means of an escape just like movies are. I don't think we walk out of movies thinking that the movie is poorly researched or that the director should have done this or the producers should have done that.     Writing is an art. No matter how you write, what you write or where you write it. If you like \\"better prose\\" or as another person stated, a sentence that would actually make them stop and say \\"that was a beautiful sentence,\\" then go get some Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Homer, Dickens, etc...     We all have different opinions on things. It is simply the way we are. It is why the world is so diverse and interesting. However, to criticize someone's work based on our own opinions is nothing short of ignorance.      Let's see some of the critics here, who probably have never actually written a book, accomplish what Dan Brown has accomplished. Write five bestselling novels, two of which were made into movies in addition to one of them being one of the biggest selling books of all time, and the one of which had an unprecedented first printing of five million copies, only then can you really criticize and scrutinize Dan Brown's work. No matter what people think, we all have to admit that Dan Brown has raised the bar in the current book business, let alone mystery novels.
0452289963|1.0|Too much new age, hippy non-sense for me.  I'm all for self improvement but this book was too magical and spiritual.
0743455967|5.0|I recommend this book not only to those reluctant writers, but for teachers for those students. I am a teacher and i found this very inspiring. I read part of it aloud to my students and they loved it. Some are even enjoying writing more. Thank you Mr. King!
0451196716|5.0|I first read this book back in the early 80's when I realized that Stephen King was Richard Bachman.  It stuck with me, it harkens to a primative realization, that there are those willing to risk life and limb for money, fame, and untold riches.  We see it every day in many ways.  But only Stephen King, eats down to the heart of the emotion that comes along with that journey.  For most people there is no one waiting there with a gun, and the \\"walk\\" is designed for youthful males...being they might have the endurance to last.  It is a journey thru the human experience, and I loved it, and still love reading the story!
B002BIULQ2|5.0|My daugher is a hugh fan of hers, she had gone to watch this movie with her mom when the movie just came out, she loved it and asked me to buy this DVD for her, so I did. She has watched it for 4-5 times already since then, I watched part of it too, but not even one from the beginning to the end, but I did like her singing though.
B001GZ6QC4|3.0|I thought the film was very good, although the story line featuring the the demise of Aaron Eckhart's character should have been deleted.  It just didn't \\"flow\\" with the rest of the story line, and was distracting and stupid.  Perhaps this side-story, after the character is injured and turns to the dark side, should have been the main plot of a different film.  The writers should have left this character in the hospital, and his fate (and face!) a mystery, and carried on with the rest of the film.  AND beause of this cumbersome and ridiculous side-story, the film was just too long!  Heath Ledger's \\"Joker\\" was more than enough to carry the entire film, and his performance was riveting. The cat-and-mouse between Batman and the Joker was excellent, although at times it stagnated, and should have been streamlined to make the chase more urgent and suspenseful.  This film did not have the excellent and \\"believeable\\" special-effects the first one had; some scenes were cartoonish and silly (cartoonish and awkward? the Bat-cycle's vertical turn-in-place! YUCK!).  The first film, \\"Batman Begins\\" was more mature and had a VERY sharp edge to it, and this film lost that edge completely, and became a \\"typical\\" action film, which disappointed me tremendously. Christian Bale and Heath Ledger's superior acting skills were lost because of this film's sometimes-silly direction.  Good, but not great.
B002JM1VJG|2.0|Whats the Point?  The Immaculate Collection is better than this crap.  It actually has music videos that show what madonna is about.  this just shows u how good madonna used to be to the crap she has become Entering the 2000's.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|Madonna, Michael Jackson & Prince all changed music forever in the 80's and 90's.  This compilation by Madonna proves her worth as top female entertainer ever.  True, some key video's are missing (FEVER / AMERICAN LIFE) but you can not deny how incredible this collection is.
0385504225|1.0|Angels and Demons was his best book.  The information offered in The Da Vinci Code was enough to keep me turning pages even though his idea of a plot (apart from some masterful puzzle work) was to give a lecture, then send his protagonists on the run again.  Indeed, The Da Vinci Code encouraged me to buy and read The Holy Blood, The Holy Grail.    But this book!  I am 1/3 of the way into it and am not sure I will be able to finish.  So far I've met a sneering, self-congratulatory villain who has about as much depth as the page he's written on, a Langdon who seems amazingly stupid, and I've read a lot of other stuff that is so timeworn from exposure I can't even claim to be learning anything new.    When I bought the book the clerk warned me that she had heard quite a few people say it was a slow starter.  Okay, so having spent a small fortune on it, maybe I'll keep slogging, but it will take more than the last 35 pages (as one reviewer recommended) to make me buy another Dan Brown novel.    Maybe the IONS and Noetic Sciences stuff is new enough to most readers to keep them intrigued, so let me add a disclaimer: I read McTaggart years ago, I belong to IONS, and none of that stuff will be sufficient to hold my interest if he gives it the same treatment he gives the Masons.    To my way of thinking Brown proves that you don't have to be a good writer, you just have to have a great premise.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Wow what a great production from showtime. Seasons 1 and 2 were awesome and season 3 delivered my ocular crack fix with no let down. each episode is like a mini cliff hanger that leaves you wanting more. my wife and i found ourselves watching 3 and sometimes 4 episodes a night until they were all finished (felt like a premature finish if you know what i mean). anywho, dont watch any of dexter season 3 until you've watched 1 and 2, or else you might miss a joke or reference. dexter makes csi, ncis or any of those other crap crime shows look like a disney production. its the real deal so start with season 1 and quickly get hooked...

Collins captured my intrest from the very first page and had me on the edge of my seat untill the cliff hanger end. Overall it was a good read and i cannot wait for the next book.
B002HNA95E|5.0|I love MADONNA and I love this compilation.  Awesome songs from the greatest artist of all time.  There's never been anyone like her, there's no one like her now, and there will never be another MADONNA and that's a fact!!!!!!!!!!!
0140282688|5.0|One of my favoorite books of all time. Delivered promptly and in perfect condition.  Read On!!
1591842972|4.0|I recommend this book. It is half bigraphical, half managment and half historical documentary. The star is Steven Jobs...who's behavior is generally reprehensible.....but justfied by the result. The book doesn't judge, it recounts stories of Jobs's interactions upon his return to a broken company. While it is clear from chapter 1 that Jobs is the bad guy in the book, you kind of look for him to save Apple throught his totalitarian ways.    Well written, and never slow moving, the book is well worth the $24 I paid at the airport. My only regret is that I will have to purchase the revised and expanded version of this book as Jobs continues his wildly successful rip and tear through conventional thinking beyond the MP3 players and Cell Phones he did yesterday.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|I'll start off with a quote from my father after he listened to this album for the first time:     \\"I don't think I've heard an album this good since Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here.\\"     While you may think that's a bit of an over-statement, it just goes to show the kind of emotional effect that Muse's music can have on people. Whether positive or negative, Muse (especially with this album) will leave an impression that will stay with you for a very long time.    I won't waste a whole lot of space with an in-depth review of each track on The Resistance. Simply put, Muse have created perhaps their most musically diverse album to date, and yet it somehow remains one of their most focused as well. There's nothing more to say about the three-part Exogenesis Symphony (that serves as a conclusion to the album) that hasn't already been said. If you are a fan of music, you owe it to yourself to listen to it.     I urge anyone with an open mind, whether die-hard Musers or those just discovering them for the first time--buy The Resistance. You won't regret it. You may even be inspired. I guess \\"Muse\\" is a very fitting name for this amazing band.
B002GU5V24|4.0|On the official Genesis website ([...]) it says in the description of this product  \\"Video content includes over 6 hours of rare live concert footage, newly filmed interviews with the band, and tv appearances\\".    I can't find \\"any\\" video footage in the box I received today, the dvd discs only have one picture per song and a 5:1 mix.    It's a great package for Genesis fans wanting these live \\"recordings\\", but this is clearly misleading or false advertising unless it's hiding somewhere (I don't think so, I've checked all discs). I was mainly interested in seeing some footage of Genesis with Gabriel. For the current version of Genesis get Rome 2007, it's awesome!
B000UR9T8C|2.0|As a child I was raised with Spiderman comics and when one of my favorite director took the reigns and gave us two incredible movies I was estatic.  The second spiderman was the heart of the comic, the doing right no matter what you had to give up.  I can't tell you how many times I watched Spiderman 2 and still love it.<br /><br />But I wish I could forget Spiderman 3.  What made Spiderman NOT Batman was his motivation wasn't revenge it was about not doing the right thing and it had a consequence.  In this movie Peter letter the robber go would not have saved his Uncle.  That he had to GET the sandman was like a thousand other movies.<br /><br />The villians had nothing on Docter Octopus, none of the tragedy the irony, the coolness that was in the second movie.  If I had never loved Spiderman, never remember why he was special I probably love this movie but I wish we could have a do over.<br /><br />Sorry Sam but what where you thinking?!
048623231X|5.0|The work by Dore is what you think of when you imagine Dante's Divine Comedy.  The comments of some should be completely disregarded and the work seen for what it is; Classic work, on Classical themes, done very well.
B002C6K7NU|5.0|This is one great double disc CD, that any true Skynyrd fan, past & present, should love & enjoy. I think Ronnie would be proud of his brother Johnny, and that the band are still carrying on. I'm not into the old band vs new band controversy. I like all versions of Skynyrd.    Some songs that sound like the \\"Old Skynyrd\\", include: \\"Simple Life\\" (this one has a theme similar to the \\"Old Skynyrd's\\", \\"Simple Man\\".) Then there's \\"Southern Ways\\", that has a theme similar to the \\"Old Skynyrd\\" sound & themes. (It mentions the \\"Hell House\\", this was the uninsulated, un-air conditioner, building where Ronnie and the guys, used to write songs, and practice.) Also, there's \\"Hobo Kinda Man\\", which is very similar to the Ronnie Van Zant song, \\"Railroad Song\\", on the \\"Nothin' Fancy\\" Album. Also, there's \\"That Ain't my America\\", its kind of like a modern day version of \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\", because it's a song with a message.  \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" defended the South. \\"That Ain't My America\\" defends the traditional, American way of life.    Now, with the \\"Current Skynyrd\\" sound, you get songs like \\"Still Unbroken\\" (They've been through hell & back, but they are still unbroken.) \\"Skynyrd Nation\\" (It a song about how the Skynyrd tradition has been carried on, even from 1st generation fans, all the way up through 2nd & 3rd generation fans.) Then there's the song, \\"God & Guns\\". I know there's a little controversy over this song, because Ronnie Van Zant had the song \\"Saturday Night Special\\". How do you reconcile the two songs? Well for one thing I've done some research on this, in the book, Freebirds by Marley Brant, she mentions that she interviewed Ronnie's widow, Judy. Judy told her that Ronnie had bought her a .38 special for self protection, and Ronnie even taught her how to use it. Also, Marley mentions the song \\"Saturday Night Special\\", was selected to be used primarily, for the Burt Reynold's movie \\"The Longest Yard\\". However, it became a hit, so they put it on their next album,\\"Nothin'Fancy\\". Marley does mention that Ronnie did believe in proper control & use of handguns. Ronnie believed that irresponsible people, should not have access to handguns, period. Ronnie sang the song \\"Saturday Night Special\\", like he really meant, what he was singing about, and I believe he was sincere. I love the song.    Also, in the October \\"holiday\\" 2009 issue of \\"Guitar World\\" magazine, Lynyrd Skynrd is on the cover, and they have an article on them concerning this \\"God + Guns\\" double CD. In this article, there are mixed feelings about handguns among the members of Skynyrd. Gary Rossington seens to be strongly against handguns, but he seems to be for owning rifles/shotguns. Rickey Medlocke is for the right to bear handguns, for self protection. There are no comments on this issue, from any of the other band members. Plus, things have changed since the Ronnie Van Zant days, that is even mentioned in the song \\"God & Guns\\". Johnny sings the song \\"God & Guns\\", like he really means it, and I believe he is sincere also. Personally, I love both songs, and I can relate to the meaning of both of the 2 songs. However, that is me, you can draw your own conclusion about the song \\"God & Guns\\". \\"Gifted Hands\\" is a great tribute song to late/great original piano player for Skynyrd, Billy Powell. The rest of the songs, speak for themselves, as you listen to them.    I really like the live version of \\"Red, White & Blue\\", it features some great piano playing from the late/great Billy Powell.    This album was dedicated to Billy Powell, and to bassist Ean Evans who both died, during the making of this album.    I hope this review has been helpful, that is the main purpose of my review. I have tried not to be judgemental, and I do not claim to be a \\"know it all\\", on Skynyrd. There are others who know things about Skynyrd, that I do not know. I have done a lot of research on Skynyrd, and I hope I've done a decent job, of explaining what I have learned.  Thanks, and enjoy thealbum.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|This is the best album by them yet. Fade away is, in my opinion best song on the album. This is one album that they really took their time with and thought through. It took along time but came out better than I had hoped. 5 stars for sure!!
0061703257|5.0|A mental asylum can be an unpleasant place to investigate a disappearance, and for Edward \\"Teddy\\" Daniels and Chuck Aule, two US Marshals, this proves to be rightfully so as they track down the disappearance of Rachel Solando.<br /><br />Dennis Lehane crafts one of the most intense and amazing suspense novels of all time with \\"Shutter Island, his 2005 mystery set in the 1950s that has recently been turned into a movie with Leo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo. Having read the book, I must say I am excited to see this movie, and dunno why Paramount took that d--k move in delaying the movie until Febuary. With how scary and challenging the book is, this would make one hell of an october scare at the cinema.<br /><br />Dennis Lehane proved that he was no flash in the pan with his previous novel, \\"Mystic River\\". Mystic River was a complex and challenging piece that is definitely hard to enjoy with how close to real life it is, and it was a hit with me.<br /><br />Shutter island takes place in 1954. Edward \\"Teddy\\" Daniels and Chuck Aule are two US marshals visiting a mental asylum on an island with crappy weather called \\"Shutter Island\\". On this island, it is said that a mentally insane murderess named Rachel Solando has escaped. Daniels and Aule are assigned by the head of the asylum, Cawley, to find Mrs. Solando and help them solitarily confine her. However, the downside is- a hurricane is to strike the island, and Daniels begins experiencing a series of strange events, ones only he can solve.<br /><br />Make no mistake, Lehane has done it again with this masterful piece. Taking more of a horror/mystery direction, Shutter Island is suspenseful from beginning to end, and never lets up. It has one of the most shocking twists I've ever read- once it comes, you won't believe what just hit you. And that ending... what an ending.<br /><br />Lehane is a masterful author, and proves so with his amazing effort, Shutter Island. I can't wait for Scorcese's adaptation in 2010! He brilliantly adapted The Last Temptation of Christ, so I assume he'll make an amazing movie of Shutter island!ist, so I assume he'll make an amazing movie of Shutter island!
B000NQPZCY|2.0|Lets see here, Kevin Costner goes to go visit his good friend, who he knows is a major drug lord, can't keep it in his pants, and boffs said drug lord's wife.  Actually, The revenge should have rightly been Anthony Quinn's... if I was a rich and all powerful drug baron and one of my gringo friends bopped my wife, I'd be looking for some payback too, especially if it was someone as smirky and annoying as Kevin Costner... heck I'd get revenge just for Waterworld and The Postman.      As for the \\"extreme violence\\", as time has progressed and violence in films has become so extreme that it has become rote, the volence in Revenge no longer seems so extreme. All in all a disappointing film.
006117758X|1.0|I love reading autobiographical type books.............I have seen review after review giving this book 5 stars and statements about how absolutely great this book is. Maybe I just didn't get it but this was one of the most boring books I have ever attempted to read (I stopped reading about half way through the book). I don't get all the hoopla around this book. I was not impressed at all..........If it weren't for the profanity I would have thought this book was written for elementary school students. I'm sorry to all of the fans, but this was AWFUL.
B002HNA95E|5.0|\\"Celebration\\" is Madonna's gift to her longtime listeners, just as much as it's a personal gift for herself. It truly is Madonna's most representative and comprehensive greatest hits set. It is surprising that a star of Madonna's magnitude has only had 2 other greatest hits CDs (\\"The Immaculate Collection\\" and later, \\"GHV2.\\") In addition to her greatest hits CDs, Madonna also has 3 other compilation albums, \\"Remixed & Revisted,\\" \\"Something to Remember,\\" and \\"You Can Dance\\" which was the very first full-length remix album of its kind. Perhaps the reason why Madonna rarely, if ever, likes to dwell on the past or repeat herself is because she is too busy living in the present and creating.      Released simultaneously around the world is Madonna's brand-new greatest hits, \\"Celebration.\\" This includes a [[ASIN:B002HNA95E 2-CD set]], in addition to an [[ASIN:B002HNA95O 18-track CD]], and a [[ASIN:B002JM1VJG 2-DVD set]]. In addition to the full-length CDs and DVDs, there are also a slew of [[ASIN:B002KPW466 Celebration CD singles]] put out in both the US and abroad. And, although a limited edition CD has not been pressed for the North American market, a special edition Taiwanese CD which comes with a 40-page booklet and a poster with a specially made notebook as well as a [[ASIN:B002J951A4 Japanese CD]] and a  [[ASIN:B002Q956QQ special CD for North Korea]] are currently available. I have been told that since Madonna is very busy with lots of other projects she will not be doing any promotion for \\"Celebration,\\" so I am sure that Warner Bros. Records will also be putting out lots of promo-only items to help push this to the top of the charts.    All tracks have been digitally remastered specifically for this set and sound better than ever. It's almost like Madonna is giving a special concert for her fans right in their own living rooms. She's never sounded richer or stronger or deeper. This is why Madonna is the Queen of Pop.      Here are all the tracks included on \\"Celebration\\"     CD#1  from the '05 album Confessions on a Dance Floor  1) Hung Up / peaked at #7  This was Madonna's song that \\"went back to her roots.\\" After perhaps one of the most personal records of her entire profession (2003's \\"American Life\\") Madonna made a firm effort not to get political or serious on her songs ever again. \\"Hung Up\\" is a fast and catchy track that you will love because Madonna sounds spirited and her lyrics match her pitch.      from the '00 album Music  2) Music / peaked at #1  \\"Music\\" was Madonna's first #1 song in years and years and this also marked another important milestone for the Material Girl as it became another one of her signature anthems. On this track Madonna shakes it real funky and shakes it really low.        from the '90 album I'm Breathless  3) Vogue / peaked at #1  Even with the Holy Messiah of Gay Icons (sorry Barbra Streisand fans) the dance never caught on. Instead, the song and the video for \\"Vogue\\" were literally played every hour and every day on MTV and top-50 stations coast-to-coast, making it one of the most successful singles ever.     from the '08 album Hard Candy  4) 4 Minutes / peaked at #3  This includes a great duet with Madonna's collaborator and friend Justin Timberlake. I love this song because even though it's a new(er) track Madonna still sounds fresh and exciting and over-the-top.      from the '83 album Madonna  5) Holiday / peaked at #16  \\"Holiday\\" is just one more of Madonna's trademark hits that she's most likely to sing because the lyrics both reflect her feelings and mirror the benchmark message of her music through the years.     from the '83 album Madonna  6) Everybody / did not position   Madonna's very first single after being signed as a solo performer to Warner Bros. Records' Sire Records was released in late '82. The song never did well on the charts, but Madonna's fans have never forsaken it.     from the '84 album Like a Virgin  7) Like a Virgin / peaked at #1  Madonna has re-invented thissong nearly as much as she's re-invented herself. In the mid `80s she sang it like a true pop princess with her wedding dress on. During \\"The Girlie Show\\" she performed her first #1 hit as a drag-king in tribute to the great Marlene Dietrich. And during a special concert that she gave in '03 she sang it a capella, missing some lyrics; claiming that she had forgotten them.      from the b-side of the '85 single Angel  8) Into the Groove / peaked at #1 (UK)  In the US \\"Into the Groove\\" was only known as an obscure b-side to \\"Angel.\\" However with the release of \\"The Madonna Movie,\\" (otherwise known as \\"Desperately Seeking Susan\\") it became a huge club sensation. It's another crazy-moving track that's all about dancing and shaking your booty to the beat.      from the '89 album Like a Prayer  9) Like a Prayer / peaked at #1  Madonna stops bleaching her hair long enough to get serious as she sings about burning crosses, Black Jesuses and S-E-X on an alter! The song is very subdued. But more than that, \\"Like a Prayer\\" is a very beautiful track that really cemented Madonna's place in pop culture. It was also Madonna's very first CD single and Warner Bros. pulled out all the stops for it. If you own the original 3\\" US single hold on to it!     from the '98 album Ray of Light  10) Ray of Light / peaked at #5  As the world was crossing the threshold into the `00s Madonna wrote about a \\"day in the life of the world.\\" Such a fast-moving track and so beautiful and easy to listen to.      from the '05 album Confessions on a Dance Floor  11) Sorry / peaked at #58  Even with nearly zero radio play, \\"Sorry\\" became an instant party hit because Madonna showcased an entirely new sound this time around. She sounded young and fresh, but she was also bold and confident and her lyrics were in a variety of fun-sounding languages.      from the '89 album Like a Prayer  12) Express Yourself / peaked at #2  \\"Come on girls, do you believe in love? Because I got something to say about it...\\" IMO this is probably Madonna's definitive signature anthem. It is the ultimate party hit. And when I listen to it I am fondly reminded of Madonna coming down on the go-go ball during \\"The Girlie Show.\\" I adore this song because it sounds fantastic and has such a great message.      from the '86 album True Blue  13) Open Your Heart / peaked at #1  I looooooooove \\"Open Your Heart.\\" The song was written at a time when Madonna was happily married so it's difficult to tell who she was talking to or about, but that doesn't matter. It's a song about a woman trying to get her boyfriend to listen to her and open up.     from the '83 album Madonna   14) Borderline / peaked at #10   \\"Borderline\\" became Madonna's very first track that broke into the top-10. It almost reminds me of \\"Like a Virgin\\" but has somewhat of a somber and slower quality to it.     from the '94 album Bedtime Stories   15) Secret / peaked at #3   It's no wonder that with a blend of both dance and R&B New York's Hot-97 often played \\"Secret\\" in heavy rotation. This was also a fine track to bridge the gap between Madonna's prior sound and more current material, making it the lead single off of \\"Bedtime Stories.\\"       from the '92 album Erotica  16) Erotica / peaked at #3    I know for a fact that Madonna was very disappointed that this song did not go to #1 because she put so much energy and effort into her entire \\"Erotica\\" persona. The song is beautiful and one of my personal favorites because Madonna whispers frankly about many things that were rarely heard of on the radio beforehand.      from the '90 album The Immaculate Collection   17) Justify My Love / peaked at #1   \\"Justify My Love\\" is similar to \\"Erotica,\\" but it also has its own identity firmly rooted in dance and R&B. For its time the song was considered very risqué. And if you have the maxi-single there are also a slew of other great tracks, such as the \\"Beast within Mix\\" which also received heavy rotation on the airwaves.      new track for thisalbum:   18) Revolver / not released  This is Madonna's newest track, produced specifically to cap off this CD. \\"Revolver\\" is a fantastic pop track that was produced by both Lil Wayne and Madonna, and is the perfect compliment to this collection.     CD#2  from the '85 album Like a Virgin  1) Dress You Up / peaked at #3   \\"Dress You Up\\" is total in-your-face pop. In this very danceable track Madonna sings about \\"dressing up\\" her boyfriend with her love.      from the '85 album Like a Virgin  2) Material Girl / peaked at #2    Another one of Madonna's signature hits; although she has rarely sang it over the years. The song is about excess but Madonna claimed that \\"no one got it.\\" Instead like that proverbial scarlet letter, she will forever be branded the Material Girl.      from the '86 album True Blue  3) La Isla Bonita / peaked at #2   Madonna's very first track to mix both English and Spanish is a lovely song that everyone will relish. It also became Madonna's very first #1 song in France. \\"La Isla Bonita\\" is a super-sensitive and sexy dance-track.      from the '86 album True Blue  4) Papa Don't Preach / peaked at #1    At the time of this songs release it was played constantly on radio stations and the video was in extremely heavy rotation. This time Madonna mixes controversy and pop to lend a great message to \\"Papa Don't Preach.\\"      from the '83 album Madonna  5) Lucky Star / peaked at #4   \\"Lucky Star\\" became Madonna's very first top-5 hit. There's no real rhyme or reason to the lyrics; instead Madonna just sings about her \\"lucky star.\\" But does that matter?      from the '83 album Madonna  6) Burning Up / did not position    \\"Burning Up\\" is Madonna's second single. It's a high-tempo song that moves quickly and perhaps not surprisingly has a strong message about what a girl will do to win her man's affection.     from the '85 album Vision Quest   7) Crazy for You / peaked at #1   \\"Crazy for You\\" became Madonna's very first #1 ballad. It's sexy, slow and somewhat of a glum-sounding hit. But it's also the type of song you want to listen to with someone you love close by. Perhaps it's no coincidence that \\"Crazy for You\\" is often played at weddings and commitment ceremonies.      from the '87 album Who's That Girl   8) Who's That Girl / peaked at #1  \\"Quien es esa niña...\\" I am so excited that \\"Who's That Girl\\" is included because it deserves to have a place on this record just as much as all of the other tracks. If you're a longtime fan I don't need to tell you how much Madonna despises this song and has refused to perform it at any of her concerts since her first world tour. \\"Who's That Girl\\" has been described as a \\"La Isla Bonita\\" knockoff or a \\"throwaway\\" track from \\"True Blue.\\" But I personally love it because it's pure popular dance with a little bit of Spanglish thrown in for good measure.     from the '98 album Ray of Light    9) Frozen / peaked at #2  \\"Frozen\\" was Madonna's first single since training for EVITA and boy could we see a difference. She once said that this was her best song to reintroduce herself on her first studio record in over 3 years and I agree. Yes it's a slow-moving song, but that doesn't make any difference because Madonna's voice is so beautiful.      from the '08 album Hard Candy  10) Miles Away / did not position   This is a song that Madonna wrote about the discontent in her second marriage (although not nearly as dramatic as \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\" about her first marriage to Sean). Perhaps because it came out while she was on tour (and thus received limited support) the song did not do very well. However, fans fell in love with it.      from the '94 album Bedtime Stories  11) Take a Bow / peaked at #1  \\"Take a Bow\\" was produced by Madonna and Kenny Edmonds, becoming Madonna's most successful single ever, staying on the charts longer than any of her other songs. It's a lavish and slow track that includes a nice tempo.      from the '86 album True Blue  12) Live to Tell / peaked at #1\\"A man can tell a thousand lies, I've learned my lesson well...\\" One of my very favorite Madonna songs, ever. I could write 10 pages just about \\"Live to Tell.\\" It's such a moving and touching track. Although the song was included in the movie \\"At Close Range,\\" Madonna chose to release this ballad as the lead single for \\"True Blue.\\" During \\"The Blond Ambition Tour\\" Madonna performed \\"Live to Tell\\" side-by-side with \\"Oh Father\\" (another one of my favorites) but has rarely sang it over the years since.      from the '99 album Austin Powers  13) Beautiful Stranger / peaked at #19   This is a frenzied and fast-moving track. It's almost harkens back to the `70s, but with its electronica beat \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" has its roots firmly planted in the `90s.      from the '03 album American Life  14) Hollywood / did not position    Perhaps because of the public backlash of \\"American Life,\\" \\"Hollywood\\" did very poorly commercially. However, this was again a time that Madonna's legion of fans supported her. We did not forget this song and we stood firmly by Madonna because she never abandoned us when we needed her.      from the '02 album Die Another Day  15) Die Another Day / peaked at #8  Such a dramatic and almost violent song. It even has a sexy quality to it. \\"Die Another Day\\" is the type of song that will get into your mind long after the MP3 has stopped.      from the '00 album Music  16) Don't Tell Me / peaked at #4   As a huge country music fan I love this song. \\"Don't Tell Me\\" is a pop-fabulous track that mixes country and dance. It was written by Madonna and her brother-in-low, Joe Henry.     from the '89 album Like a Prayer  17) Cherish / peaked at #2   This' such a sweet and happy song that will bring a smile to anyone's face and warm your heart, too. Like Madonna has done for the past quarter of a century, \\"Cherish\\" is a reminder to be kind to others and to show compassion and love to your fellow (wo)man.      new track for this album:   18) Celebration / still positioning   This is the perfect song to launch Madonna's greatest hits collection. It's a memorable track because Madonna gives it her all. She sounds like she did 27 years ago: bold, fresh, exciting, sexy and very ambitious!      With a star of Madonna's caliber it could not have been an easy task to pick out which songs to include on \\"Celebration.\\" She has more hits and more top-10 singles than any performer and is the most successful female pop star in the entire history of the UK charts. So perhaps it's no coincidence that several of Madonna's chart toppers are noticeably absent. In my humble opinion, these tracks deserve an honorable mention: Angel (1985) / peaked at #5, Gambler (1985) / peaked at #4 in the UK, True Blue (1986) / peaked at #3, Love Makes the World Go Round (1986) / was not a commercial single, Causing a Commotion (1987) / peaked at #2, The Look of Love (1987) / peaked at #7 in the UK, Spotlight (1988) / peaked at #32 in Japan, Oh Father (1989) / peaked at #20, Keep it Together (1990) / peaked at #8, Hanky Panky (1990) / peaked at #10, Rescue Me (1991) / peaked at #9, This Used to Be My Playground (1992) / peaked at #1, Deeper and Deeper (1992) / peaked at #7, Bad Girl (1993) / peaked at #36, Fever (1993) / peaked at #6 in the UK, Rain (1993) / peaked at #11, I'll Remember (1994) / peaked at #2, Human Nature (1995) / peaked at #46, You'll See (1995) / peaked at #6, Don't Cry for Me Argentina (1997) / peaked at #7, Shanti/Ashtangi (1998) / was not a commercial single, Nothing Really Matters (1999) / peaked at #93, American Pie (2000) / peaked at #1 in the UK, American Life (2003) / peaked at #37, Nobody Knows Me (2003) / was not a commercial single and Isaac (2005) / was not a commercial single.      We've seen her left leg and her right leg and everything else. But what matters most is the art that is her music. For 3 decades, like a lioness holding onto her prey Madonna has been entertaining the world with her number one hits, eye-popping concerts, performances and music-videos. Just because she's a mother, a divorcee and a half a centurion doesn't mean this multi-platinum blonde has any plans to stop dancing \\"into the groove\\" anytime soon.       The universal message on all of Madonna's music is that dreams do come true. You can do whatever you choose if you work hard and set your mind to it. From the most serious (\\"Like a Prayer\\" and \\"Live to Tell\\") to the most ambitious (\\"Open Your Heart\\" and \\"Express Yourself\\") to the most sweet and silly (\\"Lucky Star\\" and \\"Cherish\\") Madonna's lyrics are both inspirational and life-affirming. Madonna was the voice for an entire generation. As a fan for the past 30 years I can only give Madonna my deepest gratitude and respect for bringing so much happiness and entertainment and joy to the world. Remember, you are what you listen to.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|Evolution is a dangerous thing in the music business when you've already got a good thing going. Change is tampering with exceptional achievement in Paramore's case, but what strikes me about 'Brand New Eyes' is that it seems the band wasn't at all influenced by the raging success and commercialism of 'Riot!'. They made the album they wanted to make, and I think striving for quality over fame makes this band special and makes this album remarkable.<br /><br />Three strikes and you're out; three hits, you're a star, and Paramore has introduced itself as one of the elite bands of the decade. 'Brand New Eyes' is balanced top to bottom, from wicked edgy hits to heartfelt ballads to mid-tempo pop rock. Hayley Williams displays a lyrical clinic, mixing raw emotion with attitude and humility.<br />Simply put, it's not as radio friendly as its predecessor, not by a long shot, but it's the band's most diverse, complete, polished album to date. Considering the quality of their debut and sophomore records, that's saying something.<br /><br />Noteworthy:<br />- If there is a such thing as \\"vintage\\" Paramore, the opening track, \\"Careful\\" fits the description. It's a high energy, fast paced rock song with cutting vocals and great guitar work from Josh Farro and newest permanent band member, Taylor York.<br /><br />- The first song I heard from this album was \\"Where The Lines Overlap\\" when Paramore was on tour with No Doubt. Although I can't help hearing Avril Lavigne when I listen to this song, it's a very simple, honest song dedicated to the fans and team that has taken Paramore to the unthinkable heights they've reached. Though it isn't listed as a potential single, I wouldn't be surprised if it gets some pop station radio play sometime in 2010.<br /><br />- \\"All I Wanted\\" is the dark horse of the album much in the way \\"My Heart\\" was on 'All We Know Is Falling.' It brings the record full circle and displays truly marvelous instrumentation and vocals.<br /><br />- \\"Feeling Sorry\\" and \\"Playing God\\" are crafty mid-tempo rock songs. Along with \\"Ignorance\\" and \\"Misguided Ghosts\\", Hayley's writing shines brightest on these two songs. The genuine attitude mixed with clever lyrics make these tracks a great listen time and time again.<br /><br />- Many have been talking about Paramore's implementation of more slow songs into this album. \\"The Only Exception\\" is poised to be the band's third single, and though it doesn't strike me as an iTunes killer, it's a well scripted track. Hayley Williams hits low notes just as well as the high ones, and that's what astonished me about this song. \\"Misguided Ghosts\\", the other slow song, is a beautifully crafted track. In fact, I can't help but hear Regina Spektor when I listen to this song.<br />What you have to remember when listening to songs like \\"Misguided Ghosts\\" is that this band is composed of a bunch of kids. Hayley Williams can't even get into a bar yet. Taylor York and Zac Farro are still teenagers. Jeremy Davis is 24 and he's the oldest member of the band, and somehow they're showing talent and maturity well beyond their years without compromising their youthful side.<br /><br />What more can you ask from a band that's sustained enough success in the music business to duck under and be set for life? You know what 'Brand New Eyes' tells me more than anything? Paramore cares about their music, and they care about their fans.<br /><br />As a whole, I think if you were a bigger fan of 'All We Know Is Falling', you'll love this album. If you're looking for catchier tunes, hit singles and chart blazers as in 'Riot!', you might be looking the wrong way. And that's not a bad thing. I loved 'Riot!', but I've learned that the best thing you can do if you really love a band is to try your best not to compare albums. You'll wind up disappointed more times than not.<br /><br />Album Grade: A-ngs. Along with \\"Ignorance\\" and \\"Misguided Ghosts\\", Hayley's writing shines brightest on these two songs.

0385504225|4.0|Unlike \\"The DaVinci Code\\", this book seems to do more good than harm, especially in the last 35 pages. By this I mean that this book doesn't badmouth any church or religion, whereas that book sensationalized and alleged too many possibly evil & negative beliefs and practices, etc., such as its descriptions of the Catholic Church's Opus Dei organization.     Also,I read \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" and felt that it was much more confusing than this book.     I admit I'm biased in favor of this book because I have fewer prejudices about Freemasonry and Christianity and institutional religion in general than many people do. This book pleased me for the following reasons, among many:   -It explains and even praises the many merits of The Bible and other books of \\"scripture\\";   -It encourages hope that we are now discovering new science which might unlock vast powers to mankind;   -The descriptions of U.S. history and of Washington, D.C., are so fascinating that now I want to use the World Wide Web's photo services to explore that city, from the air and from the ground, to see for myself what would take weeks of walking (and flying overhead) to see;    It is \\"humanistic\\" enough to please the secularists and maybe even the agnostics and atheists;   -And, since I don't have time now for a longer review, I must resort to:\\" ...and much, much more!\\"    This is also a fairly good thriller.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|This is the best album I've heard in years!The material is very diverse, interesting and fresh. \\"I LOOK TO YOU\\" proves once again that WHITNEY is \\"THE VOICE\\"! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO EVERYONE!
0385504225|1.0|I did enjoy Da Vinci code, and Angels and Demons was tolerable, but this new book by Dan Brown is horrible. A little Google searching at the begining of it would have saved the main characters a lot of trouble. The writing is poor, the plot is just as bad. The main \\"bad guy\\" is laughable.     let's just take one example - the CIA sends Robert and Katherine off to the house where her brother has supposedly been found. Supposedly the cops are there. With all of the CIA's vaunted technology (which they've been bragging about throughout the book) no one checked to see if the cops were actually there?    And way too much of \\"Oh, of course, that's the answer! it's clear to see\\" but them not telling you what they saw for a few more pages.     I am struggling to finish this book, but really felt like putting it down after the first few chapters...    Anne
1416594787|3.0|This book is the latest among a long list of evolutionary texts by Dawkins. By his own admission, this book differs from his previous works. While his other books assume the truth of evolution, and thus, sought to answer specific and common criticisms against evolution (often espoused by creationists), this is the first time Dawkins has attempted to lay out the actual evidence for its acceptance by the scientific community.    His book was well written, articulated in a readable style, and quite enjoyable. In fact, I found it difficult to put the book down. Dawkins provides a good general view of why scientists accept evolution and a good case for the plausbility of natural selection as the vehicle for adaptive change. However, I do have some criticisms of his book, which prevented me from giving it 5 stars, especially if I view it from the mindset of a biblical literalist (a view I once shared many decades ago... and these are the people who need the most convincing).    My number one complaint is that he did not provide much in evidence, and where he did provide evidence it was short on detail. For instance, in Chapter 2, Dawkins mentions that all dog breeds are descended from the wolf. Similarly, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, and other commonly distinct vegetables today are all descendants of the wild cabbage. While this might seem evident to the scientifically literate, if you don't accept evolution, you might need some convincing to show that this is true. But he doesn't provide evidence or even an explanation of how we know that dogs descended from wolves or broccoli from cabbage. He merely asserts this as evidence and then moves on to chapter 3, which concerns natural selction.    In chapter 3, he discusses flowers and insects (and birds) and presents this as evidence for evolution (specifically by natural selection). But he doesn't provide much explanation of how we know this to be true. For instance, why should we conclude that this arrangement between pollen producing flower and pollinating insect to be the result of co-evolution? How do we know that the pollen producing flower was not always the way it is and that the pollinating insect was not always the way it is and that these two merely \\"found\\" or discovered one another, in essence, falling into and exploiting a niche that was always present? [This might seem crazy, but this was actually used in an argument by a creationist]    Another criticism. He was careful to define the distinction between a scientific theory and a mere hypothesis or conjecture. Yet through much of the first few chapters of his book, he is short on evidence and long on speculation. For instance, he mentions the Heika japonica crab, with the resemblance of a samurai warrior on the back of its shell. While Carl Sagan states that this was the result of natural selection, Dawkins states it probably was not; it was likely coincidence. But this very case has often been cited as evidence for evolution (by selection). Is this evidence of evolution or not? And if not, then why is Dawkins' mentioning this in his book. If anything it calls into question how we determine that something is the result of evolution (and therefore qualified as evidence), as opposed to coincidence or something else? From this example, it seems almost arbitrary.    His review of the fossil record is compelling but rehashes the same information presented in other books. And he doesn't explain how we know that the discovered fossils represent a history of the same clad, as opposed to distinct, unrelated organisms. This is particularly important since we are often comparing fossils from different time periods, from different geographical locations, and don't have access to the entire skeletal remains (let alone genetic information) of the organisms that we are claiming are descended from one another. For example, how do we know that we aren't merely pattern seeking when we look at Pakicetus, Ambulocetus, and Basilosaurus? Or Australopithecus and Homo? Moreover, he spends most of the chapter on human evolution explaining why paleontologists feud over the specific genus (or species) of particular fossils and why such arguments would be predicted under evolution precisely because they represent intermediates. But his explanation could've been condensed into 1 paragraph. It would've been far better if he spent the time to present more evidence among the mountains of evidence that are claimed to exist.    His chapter, \\"You did it yourself in nine months\\", was spent explaining by analogy that matter is capable of self assembly from the bottom-up, rather than a top-down approach as espoused by creationists. He presents his hypothesis that this is possible via \\"local rules\\" and uses the analogies of the starling and origami as examples, but this is not evidence. In fact, while analogy can clarify and improve understanding, it does not constitute evidence. Dawkins forgets that the \\"local rules\\" are functioning from a template coded in our genome. Thus, can we truly say that it is the \\"local rules\\" that create the appearance of design when a recipe is necessary for determining these \\"local rules\\"? He needs to show that the genome is capable of self assembly by local rules and that a complex organism can be created from this base. While he implies that possibility during his discussion of viruses, he does not provide much detail. Thus, the reader is left unconvinced and with more questions. Thus, if you get to this point, you will have read 50% of the book and realize that much of the book has been devoted to explanation, speculation, hypotheses, and very few presentation of actual evidence. He uses computer models to illustrate or make his points. But once again, while these models may help explain concepts, they do not constitute evidence.    The last few chapters of the book are better (beginning around page 285), but by this time he's likely to have lost most of his readers, that is, those who have not already accepted evolution prior to reading this book.    My final criticism is in regard to his reference section. Most good books concerning scientific topics contain plenty of references to primary articles. But there are very few primary articles listed in this book. In fact, you'll find more scientific literature referenced in a pop diet book than here. And I am not joking! Go to a bookstore and look at the \\"Notes\\" section of Dawkins' book yourself. He does include a bibliography, but most of the entries represent secondary or tertiary sources. This doesn't mean the information is inaccurate, but it would've been nice to have citations to primary sources for those wanting to do further research.    There are some experiments mentioned in the book (rather clever ones too), but given the fact that evolutionists are always touting the volumes of evidence (and not just from fossils) for the fact of evolution, I was disappointed to find that only a handful are mentioned in the book. As mentioned earlier, most of the book is either providing background information (about rudimentary chemistry or biology), providing explanation, or tearing down common creationist arguments or criticisms against evolution, rather than focusing on positive evidence favoring evolution. Moreover, Dawkins practically ignores the evidence from molecular biology and glosses over genetics.    In short, Dawkins writes his book as if he is talking to a fellow evolutionist (preaching to the choir). But such a person does not need convincing or evidence of evolution. You can merely point or mention the \\"obvious\\" and expect the person to understand. You don't need to go into detail or explain much. On the other hand, if you do not accept evolution or require convincing, then you will likely find that Dawkins assumes too much and does not provide sufficient data or detail as to why evolution is the best explanation for the observations under discussion.    Needless to say, I was disappointedwith the book since it failed to live up to its subtitle - \\"The Evidence for Evolution\\". A more apt title would've been \\"The Plausbility of Evolution\\". He makes a good case for the reasonableness of evolution but does not provide much compelling evidence. If you are a creationist contemplating whether there is sufficient evidence for evolution, you will not be convinced by reading this book. Two far superior books (that provide better and more compelling evidence) can be found in \\"Why Evolution is True\\" and \\"Making of the Fittest\\". It isn't that Dawkins' book is bad; it provides sufficient information (on a high level) to be useful and entertaining, but don't expect it to arm you for a debate with a creationist or use it as a reference. And don't expect your creationist friend to read it and walk away a convert.
3931141802|4.0|This is an outstanding collection of photographs. The drawbacks: The book's trim size (height & width) is surprisingly small for a collection of photographs. And WATCH OUT -- for some reason, there are real con artists charging $150 and more even though this book can be bought NEW for less than $40.
B002GZQY6Q|2.0|First Wilson's over boring ambient solo release and now this. What happened to this guy? I won't rehash the negatives already posted here but this just isn't up to par for these guys on so many levels. Musically, sonically or otherwise. The engineering on this album is just OK....no where near the sonic masterpieces of what Wilson has produced in the past. If you have a good system it's OK, but don't get your hopes up. While it does have its moments they are few and far between with more than the occasional rip off of a Pink Floyd riff or something from their own past albums. A lot of this album seems to be centered on Wilson and the rest of the band are held back from their potential. IE...Gavin Harrison is one of the premier drummers in the world today and unfortunately he doesn't show it much here. If you're one of the drooling fans that thinks these guys can do no wrong...well...you'll probably like it. For me Deadwing, IA, FOABP are all albums that never leave my go to list. Not this. It's already leaving my sometimes list. Major bummer dude....they're capable of so much more.
0743243153|5.0|I keep buying this book every few years,  reading it, giving it away and then buying it again.     I don't consider this to be a \\"self-help\\" book. This book doesn't offer exercises and 10 steps you must go through to achieve x, y & z. It's a book about living, life and people. It should be re-read frequently, since, being human, we tend to forget the profound lessons that the author shares.    This book is profoundly uplifting. I know people who have been deeply and profoundly changed by reading it.    As many people have pointed out, Peck is a Christian. When this book was written, I believe that he was a practicing Buddhist.
B002BFIN6K|5.0|Zenph -     I cannot tell you how appreciative I am that you came out with this latest production.  Rachmaninoff has long been a family favorite, and a topic of much discussion,  I don't think any of us ever thought that we would actually hear him play - how could we imagine such a thing?      I have read all I can about Zenph and I do not fully understand how they do what they do ... but I quite honestly do not care.  Bringing these artists back to life is enough for me.   We are planning a family trip around hearing Zenph's Rachmaninoff performance at Carnegie Hall on November 6th - what a great way to start the holiday season.    A Huge Fan
B0013FNC38|5.0|This CD was a great surprise because I got it for the song We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things, but there's a lot more hits inside. Jason Mraz have a cool voice, a contemporary sound and very good taste for lyrics. I recommend this production 100%.
B0029LHW4U|2.0|the album plain and simple has no drive. most of the songs seem to drag and have that generic rock ovetone. alas, there are some decents tunes to be heard. \\"check my brain\\" is a fun good old AIC romp. in addition, \\"private hell\\" does a decent job mimicing the band's prior sound. sadly, \\"your decision\\" echoes the puesdo-ballad sound of past albums but falls flat. as such, the album's major downfall rests in its apparent lack of thoughtful lyrics. \\"last of my kind\\" suffers from sounding too much like the melvins and too little like AIC. \\"a looking view\\" really presents a newer side of jerry cantrell's writing. heavy and dirge-like it is a stand-out track only because it clocks in at around 7 miunutes. 7 boring minutes.     overall the album is infuratingly mediocre. gone are the meaningful lyrics pertaining to dejection, drug addiction, and sickness; in their place a new breed of thoughtless drivel forcefed to the listener. if this cd is about moving on reparations why do i feel nothing until i reach the last track? \\"black gives way to blue\\" really sounds like it should have ended up on \\"jar of flies\\", but it is a fitting close and a decent tribute to the late layne staley.     regardless of the lyrics the music is well-produced and actually quite polished. unfortunately the bass is hardly heard and the drums are sloppy. admittedly, i'm a huge (by huge i mean over-weight)fan of AIC(good thing they packed in a XL shirt w/ the delux edition). by overwight i mean i have every AIC cd, the boxed-set, the videos, a shirt, and a boot-legged early recordings thing. furthermore, i also own boggy depot and degredation trips vol. 1+2 and really wanted to see the cardboard vampires. i really do love this band. as a result, i may have been too lenient in my score. this album is in NO WAY on par w/ any of thier other stuff. duvall preforms well as lead-vocalist but, i feel, the album lacks...well...feeling.

Yes, it costs an arm and a leg, but you can't believe how much viewing material you will have at your disposal.      Only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of the packaging, believe what the others are saying, it's totally worthless.  Go figure...
B002HWRYJE|5.0|The rebirth of Star Trek has been long anticipated by fans, and the latest movie is not a sorrowful let down.  The movie is awesome and keeps the action and suspension moving through out.  It also delves into the backgrounds of Kirk and Spock's upbringing; which reveals much about their characters and who they are and who they become.  The story veers from the original Gene Rodenberry version by the fact that at the very begging of the story a future Romulan by the name of Nero arrives in federation space by a black hole; in a massive ship with weapons that far exceeds the Federations of the day.  Kirks father is one of the early casualties; which changes the course of history for the hero's.<br /> After the heroic death of Kirks father we watch as both Kirk and Spock grow of age and key events that give us insight into their characters.  Spock being the half human half Vulcan misfit doesn't fit into his culture and is often insulted not only by the young but also by the elders of his culture which help him determine his fate to be the first Vulcan to join star fleet academy.  Kirk on the other hand is a lost soul with no direction or path in his life.  That is until a bar fight with some star fleet academy students bring him into contact with Christopher Pike.  Pike becomes the sort of guiding Father figure Kirk needs to get his life in focus and Kirk decides to enlist into Star fleet.  Kirk meets members of his crew along the way including several volatile encounters with Spock.  The action of the movie heats up as Nero, who has been hiding and planning for almost twenty years comes out of hiding and enacts his vengeance on the one man he blames responsible for what happens to his world in the future, Spock.<br /> Captain Pike is captured during their first encounter with Nero and Kirk and Spock often at odds with each other must find a way to work together in order to save the federation.  This is a must see for any fans of the show.

B002BSHWUU|4.0|I just want to say, and not go into too much detail about the stereo vs mono thing, that I prefer the stereo. For one thing I happen to have two ears, and also if I were listening to the band preforming in front of me I would hear the different insruments in each ear a little differenly depending on their positioning on stage. I think this is more natural. Also I listened to PPM & PM1 on my audio system with the mono switched on, and I have to say, they sounded pretty good. I'm planning to listen to more of the CD's in the mono mode, just out of curiousity, but all in all I know I'll always prefer the stereo versions. But having this option for those of us that have the stereo box, I think gives us the best of both worlds.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I write this after just seeing them live in Seattle. I had a leaked copy of the album and was hoping to hear some of the new songs: they played 4 (Check, Looking, Acid, Black) and they just blew the house down. Jerry played Black... by himself in the encore and I find myself listening to this over and over, it is that beautiful.    This album not only retains AIC's \\"sound\\" but moves onwards & upwards from the turmoil of those last years of no music, tours, etc. If you think the album is heavy, try seeing them live--there's no word to describe how talented these guys are. Duvall is a supreme singer who can hit the highs but also lurks in the lower territories Layne lived in when needed. Plus, he plays guitar on a few songs which helps the texture of the songs as well. I love Cantrell's voice, he is a great singer in his own right and there is nothing wrong with the many dual harmonies he sings with Duvall--in fact, you know it is AIC just by hearing his voice on most songs, which, I'm sure, pleases some of the diehards who are undecided about Duvall.    This is my album of the year--you won't be checking your brain for buying it!

B002ELM5HY|5.0|I was explaining to my 13 year old daughter why Mark Knopfler is my all time favorite musician and artist. My explanation was that his music embodies all of the things that music can bring and add to one's experience when one matures. Mark Knopfler is at a point where he does not need to wow all with raging guitar solos. That is for the young. His themes have changed to clearly represent who he truly is and what he holds dear. When one is young, it is the gaining or losing of love, infatuation, and the enjoyment of youth and the promise for what one can become and the fear of not becoming something of merit. Mark Knopfler's earlier songs with Dire Straits had a higher percentage of these types of themes. They were also higher in octane over all, representing the stage of life he was in when he was performing in Dire Straits. He has moved past this in a way that reflects intelligence and subtlety and maturity, a very interesting maturity at that.    My belief is that through writing the soundtracks for Cal, Local Hero, Last Exit to Brooklyn, Shot at Glory, Princess Bride, working in the Notting Hillbillies, and Chet Atkins, all of these things enabled him to weave the musical culture and heritage of Northern England and Scotland, with American blues and country influences. This is where he is today. He is home with a style that is all his own. His songs are the stories that represent nostalgia of his youthful experiences and his formative time in the North of England/Scotland (the Car Was the One/Get Lucky/So Far From the Clyde/Before Gas and TV/Cleaning My Gun), as well as the sacrifice that others make on our behalf (Remembrance Day), the acknowledgment of great skill (Monteleone), the blues tinged You Can't Beat the House. But my favorite one of all is A Piper to the End. Mostly because it uses images of a piper (his uncle in this case) as a representative of one's essence or your soul when we go off the great beyond, with his hoping that he can still meet the uncle he never did meet. But still this song is about hope, the hope for something better, ending up in a better place when it is all over, and faithful friends. This song is utterly gorgeous like this album.

B002KVSJ64|5.0|I've loved all three of Breaking Benjamin's past albums and all their songs, but \\"Dear Agony\\" blows all they've ever done away. The sound is a bit of a mixture of \\"Phobia\\" and \\"We Are Not Alone\\", but with its own unique, new feel. The album is much more serious and quite a bit darker than even \\"Phobia\\", and almost everyone can identify with the lyrics in the songs. Burnley reached much deeper inside himself than ever before to write this album, and his lyrics this time around are some of the most powerful I've ever heard.    The album is comprised of 11 songs, 3 or 4 of which are \\"ballads\\". Some people have expressed their fears that the whole ballad thing would ruin the album, but in my opinion, the ballads (\\"Give Me a Sign\\", \\"Anthem of the Angels\\", and \\"Dear Agony\\") are not only some of the best on the album, but some of the most powerful and addicting songs Burnley has ever written.    Burnley's voice is impeccable on this album, much like it was on \\"Phobia\\". Instrumentally, the band sticks with the same precise and soaring notes that have made them what they are today. But they've added a few new sounds to each song using clever production techniques. The intros to \\"Fade Away\\", \\"I Will Not Bow\\", \\"Hopeless\\", and \\"What Lies Beneath\\" all showcase this. They also incorporate strings in \\"Anthem of the Angels\\" and \\"Without You\\", giving them a more epic feel than most previous BB songs.    Overall, this is not only the best album I've heard all year, but the best album I've EVER heard. If it takes three years to write something this good, by all means take your time Ben!    Track by Track listing:    1. \\"Fade Away\\" - An eerie opening to the album. Has one of the best intros I've ever heard, albeit short. The song itself can be a little depressing, but it sets the mood for the album. I could definitely see this one ending up in the credits or soundtrack of an upcoming horror movie (maybe Saw VI?) - 10/10    2. \\"I Will Not Bow\\" - The first single off the album. In my opinion one of the most infectious songs BB has released. From the faded intro to the anthem-like chorus (complete with superb percussion skills from Chad), this song will pull you in and never let you go. I've listened to it 128 times since downloading it September 1st. - 10/10    3. \\"Crawl\\" - A very unique song in my opinion. The chorus will lead you to believe this is one of the ballads, but then the chorus starts and Ben unleashes a new type of growl that sounds as if he's vomiting. A great song. - 10/10    4. \\"Give Me a Sign\\" - The first \\"ballad\\" on the album. Great intro and powerful lyrics. The chorus and bridge are some of the best Breaking Benjamin's ever done. Ben's voice is incredible on this song. - 10/10    5. \\"Hopeless\\" - Arguably the heaviest song on the album. The chorus is full of screams overlapped with singing. Great guitar solo as well. - 10/10    6. \\"What Lies Beneath\\" - One of my absolute favorites. Amazing intro, with great production sounds that sound like wind or water flowing through a tunnel. Eerie. Then the single strumming of a guitar. It has a real 80s feel to it. Vocally one of Ben's best songs, and the chorus is incredibly addictive. Oh, and there are some growls/screams in this one as well :) - 10/10    7. \\"Anthem of the Angels\\" - Probably the most unique song Breaking Benjamin has done since \\"Forget It\\". The strings and low drums give it a somber feel at first, but then they increase in pitch around the second chorus and give an epic feel to the song. It almost sounds like a Red song, but with Breaking Benjamin's own signature touch. Easily one of my all-time favorites. - 10/10    8. \\"Lights Out\\" - The most aggressive song of the album. \\"When the lights go out on you, when your worthless life is through, I will remember how you screamed. I can't afford to care. I can't afford to care.\\" is the last part of the chorus and probably one of the most memorable ones Ben has written. One of the more energetic songs on the album and one of thebest guitar solos as well. -10/10    9. \\"Dear Agony\\" - This sounds like the most personal song Ben wrote for the album. The lyrics talk about the health problems he now has to live with after almost ten years of alcoholism. The intro is amazing and energetic/upbeat, while the verses are somber, yet hopeful. The chorus is very powerful, both lyrically and vocally. I wouldn't be surprised if this winds up as the 2nd single. - 10/10    10. \\"Into the Nothing\\" - The intro of this song is \\"Saturate\\"-esque in my opinion. The verses sound a little like the chorus to Mudvayne's \\"Forget to Remember\\". The chorus is soaring and the bridge is very catchy as well (\\"Where I lead, you cannot follow\\"). -10/10    11. \\"Without You\\" - The second song featuring strings (the last 47 seconds of the song is all string music). Again, this one sounds quite a bit different than most of the others, but it's a great song to end the album. Very powerful and infectious. -10/10
B001HN69AE|1.0|First off let me say that I am a Dragon Ball fan and I wanted this to be good. I wanted the awesome fight scenes and equally awesome characters that I knew and loved from the series. Except the writers/producers/Director/Studio decided to spit in my face for have paying for their movie. Even if you are a hardcore Dragon Ball fan this plot will seem poorly paced and badly acted. The characters have no deveolpment at all, The two romances in the movie (Goku and Chi-Chi, Bulma and Yamcha) are forced at best and at worst hastily put together. Goku is whinny, a far deviation from his care free fun loving character from the show. Chi-chi doesnt have a personality besides being Goku's girlfriend. Bulma is a sterotypical tough girl. Yamcha is another character who doesnt have enough screen time to even have a personality and I wouldn't have known who it was if he didn't say his name before hand. Master Roshi is played by chow yung fat a highly respected actor (for good reasons) but even he seemed to just cringe because oif his poorly written lines. Picolo also doesnt have any screen time worth a damn and his assasin is the major villian.

0756405890|3.0|Reading the reviews on amazon, you'll find a large number of people claiming it's among the best books ever written as well as a significant minority of people claiming it to be among the worst. I had been recommended this book because I enjoyed George R.R. Martin and didn't read any of the dissenting reviews until after I had purchased the book. Accordingly, I proceeded with caution. I hoped for the best, but prepared for the worst.     The book didn't grab me right away, but few books do. I read when I had the time, but it was pretty easy to put the book aside. In fact, around page 80, I put this book down and finished an entirely different book before I came back to this one. It wasn't until over 130 pages into the book that something interesting finally happened. My hopes for the book were renewed....at least for awhile.    Without getting into too much detail and spoiling things, Kvothe (our hero) ends up eventually spending a lengthy stint on the streets of a mean city. Parts of this are certainly interesting, but this section of the book really only hints at what the story is actually about and drags quite often (it's nearly 100 pages long). It isn't until after all of this that Kvothe makes his way to the Magic School (where the Harry Potter comparisons come from) where the bulk of the novel takes place. And since this means Kvothe is in a new setting and no characters remain around from the first couple hundred pages of the book, the author is basically back to providing exposition once again. It feels a bit like the author is jumping all over the place at this point in the book without a clue as to where he is going. If you continue to the end, it becomes more clear that Rothfuss does have a clue where he's going but you won't necessarily sense that here. In fact, when I was approaching page 300, I ended up putting the book aside again for about a month before I felt compelled to try again.    And it is at this point, that the book finally begins to take off. The characters introduced at the Magic School are the first aside from Kvothe to get any character development and any time to grow on the audience before disappearing entirely. We are finally introduced to Kvothe's romantic interest. We finally see things happening to Kvothe. And, eventually, we even get some action.    Looking back, a lot of the first half of this book is there for a reason. It sets things up for the book's much better second half. The second half of this book is an entirely different experience than the first half, so much so you might even suspect a different author was at work here. The book definitely requires patience, because I won't lie: a good portion of the first half is difficult. Not because it's hard to follow, but just because it seems to be too much. Pacing is a big problem in the first half of this book. While much of what is presented there becomes important later in the book (and I'm guessing other portions will reveal themselves as important later in the series), it's hard not to feel like the book couldn't have been edited a little more. It would have been better for it. I got this book in June. I finished near the end of September. I read the last 400 pages in about a week. This gives you an idea about how much the book improves. I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to recommend this book to someone because of the first 300 pages, however. I probably would tell them to give it a try if they thought they had the patience to ride out the not-so-brilliant beginning but only under those circumstances should they pick the book up.     Even as it goes on, a few minor problems stand out: the most glaring is how many disposable characters are in the book. Only Kvothe and Denna receive much development. The rest are more one-dimensional. I also feel that the book ends in kind of a strange spot, but that's understandable as this is a series and the story is incomplete.    One thing is for certain: the book inspires strong feelings. Somelove it. Some really hate it. For that reason, I would suggest potential buyers read multiple reviews. Read a few favorable reviews and a few negative reviews and after that decide if this book is for you. In my opinion, it's overhyped but decent for what it is.

B002HNA95E|5.0|\\"Celebration\\" the new remastered double cd by the Queen of Pop is indeed a fitting end to Madonna's 25 years stint with Warner Bros. For whatever reasons she may have for leaving Warner, she nevertheless thanked Warner for the support in her thank you notes. Listening to the songs just remind you that Madonna is the ultimate Queen of Pop and while she has experimented with different types of music through the years, she has maintained that pop vibe in all her songs. This brilliant 2-cd set simply proves that Madonna is a true and great American artist because she has artistically evolved through the years. Each song in the set is distinct (unlike most artists whose songs sound irritatingly the same) and has its own identity. While many may argue about the songs which did not make it to the set (with Madonna's numerous hits, it is impossible to include all) or some may argue that edit versions or better versions should have been placed instead of the versions which are in the cd, this compilation basically contains the definitive hits which made Madonna the pop icon that she is. The two new tracks (Celebration and Revolver) are fantastic songs that truly deserve to be in this compilation and to be heard on radio. Thank you Madonna for the music that has inspired your fans all these years (she thanked every single one of her fans). Here's looking at the next 25 years of pop music from the Queen of Pop! I hope that your stint with Live Nation will prove to be as fruitful as your Warner years! Mabuhay!
0385341075|4.0|\\"Mister Pip\\" is told by Matilda, who was born and raised on a tropical island not far from Australia. Although the story begins in the early 1990s, when Matilda was 13 years old, most people on the island knew little of the outside world - the islanders had only come into contact with the 'modern' world in her grandfather's time. When Matilda was 11, her father went off to an Australian town for work; she and her mother were on the verge of joining him when the book opens. Unfortunately, their plans are scuppered when war breaks out on the island. The 'rebels' declared war on the copper mine and the company - which, in turn, brought in its own soldiers. The company planned to choke the rebels into submission and started by setting up a sea blockade. Before long, the power supplies are gone, hospitals are being raided for medicines and 'company' people start leaving...    Mr Watts was the only white man in Matilda's village who stayed. For many years, he had been known as Popeye and was married to Grace, who'd been born and raised in Matilda's village. They'd always kept themselves slightly apart - they lived in the old minister's house, hiding behind its overgrown garden, and had no children. He also appeared a little eccentric : he wore a white suit every day, regularly wheeled Grace around on a trolley and occasionally wore a red clown's nose. However, after the war broke out, he became one or the most important people in Grace's life.     With no teachers left, Mr Watts stepped into the gap. With what's happening, though, the school isn't as well-resourced as it should be and a copy of Dickens' \\"Great Expectations\\" becomes the classroom's only textbook. Matilda is enthralled, even though she doesn't always understand Victorian England. (On top of that, she has no idea what marshes are, and the whole class find the idea of a frosty morning incredible). Unfortunately, Matilda's mother and Mr Watts don't quite see eye to eye - with the book and Mr Watts' lack of faith providing the two biggest points of friction. As the classroom's star pupil, Matilda finds herself in an awkward position.     An easily read book, though - while it's not a sad or depressing book - there are a couple of shocking and sad moments, thanks to the war.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|A CELEBRATION indeed! it's about time that a DVD collection packed with most of Madonna's videos is released. Of course a few videos were left out, but we can't always have what we want right? I love this compilation, and personally think that the selection was picked wisely. At least 18 of these videos were never released on DVD before. It's great to finally have them. After watching the 2 DVDs, there is no doubt that Madonna proves us why she's still on top of her game after 26 years. AMAZING!

0061684384|2.0|Kat lacks any ability for narrative storytelling, so she exploits her tattoo clients' real stories, and makes money off of their experiences. She leads us to believe that she was affected by her Tattoo clients' stories. If she was, then she would have given them royalties to their stories, rather than keeping the cash to help subsidize her income, because of her inability to do more than just awesome Portrait tattoos.  The pages are covered with scattered senseless artifacts with minimal design. I felt like I was looking at Kats junk drawer in her mind. It belongs on the shelf of a Hot topic in the mall.
0061537934|2.0|started off well, thought it would have much more to do with the dog/human relationship with the car racing being the link between them.  Turned out to be a \\"movie of the week\\" with fabricated drama that you never quite believe, it's all just sorta dropped in your lap.    I've never finished a book so quickly but that's primarily because I skimmed it over two evenings, literally scanning 2-3 pages at a time.    I love dogs and F1 racing, but can't recommend this to any of my like-minded friends.  I'd be embarrassed.    Which is sad because the title is so alluringly good.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I AM SO HAPPY THAT THE VOICE HAS RETURNED WITH SOME NEW MUSIC.  MUSIC TODAY SUCKS!!! NOTHING BUT BEAT WITH A MEDICORE VOICE.

NO FILLERS HERE PEOPLE.  I HAVE A FEW FAVORITES ON IT.  I LOOK TO YOU IS A AMAZING SONG WRITTEN BY R. KELLY AND SHOWS WHITNEY'S LOVE FOR GOD!!!

WELL DONE WHITNEY HOUSTON AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE LOVED.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|Some of the best guitar work ever by Dave and Chris.  I loved Marty, Chris is at least his equal.  As for the Metallica/Megadeth thing,  Megadeth sounds much more relevant and real at this point in their career.  Who do you think wrote the early Metallica stuff anyway?  Metallica died with Cliff Burton, IMO.    If you want to know where some of Dave's ideas come from, watch the Alex Jones movie \\"Endgame\\" (that is where this title comes from).  Confirmed with Dave's interview on the Alex Jones show last week.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|At best, people understand in retrospect that this movie gets a bad rap, simply because of it's connections to Disney and lack of Disney-fied elements. That Disney shut down production of this movie three times during the making of it and then failed to market it to the \\"appropriate\\" audience. It was released at the same time as Back to the Future, Out of Africa, and the Breakfast Club. It failed at the box office and is seen to have the same kind of followers as the Dark Crystal and Star Wars. As I mentioned before Disney had absolutely no participation in the actual production and had little knowledge of what a \\"dark, haunting, and fantastical\\" movie it was. And yes, despite it's many homages and references to it, it is \\"NOTHING LIKE THE 1939 CLASSIC\\"....but...SO WHAT?    To those who actually saw the film and attempted to make comparisons to the 1939 \\"original\\", I say you have no right to even share your dissatisfaction. This movie was made just shy of the 50th anniversary of the original release and is therefore completely separate; even in it's attempts to sequel it! How dare film makers make a dark film geared towards children, only Tim Burton is allowed to do that!    As a very young child I was privy to see the 50th anniversary documentary about the \\"chaos, confusion, and terror\\" that went on behind the scenes of the MGM flick. While I was captured by the movie itself, I was even more intrigued by the amount of dedication, toil, and tears that went into it. Because of that early dose of reality to this day I see it as retro nostalgia of epic proportions; a beautifully scored train-wreck. To the dismay of fellow movie-goers/film buffs, I love it as much as I despise it. Despite the fact that I still nod to the original cast for their immense talent and ingenuity, I have reconciled to the fact that the entire OZ empire is ironically a complete sham. The man behind the curtain has been revealed. This point proven to me even more by the recent re-release of their NEW REMASTERED BLU RAY DVD AND ALL THE NEW PRETTY SHINYS THAT COME WITH!    It is this pandering and sugar-coating, that made some of us yearn,no- ache, for something like Return to OZ. I will explain why with details too vague to be considered spoilers.    The audience of the original film that was captivated and intrigued as I was,were just as equally captivated by a movie so separate from it. For those who enjoy fantasy films, and are children of the eighties, we have been given many new worlds to explore, ones that our parents could hardly dream of. Once we are apart of this new world, we want to understand it in a deeper way. We want it to always be there for us, to know we always belong there. This is the essence of Return to OZ.    What audiences of this movie would want to remember in viewing this, though I cannot imagine how it is lost on them, is that OZ is a world that exists in the mind of a child. Even the \\"original\\" Dorothy can only arrive in OZ with a swift bump on the head. Once she is there, however, this world is to the child what she desires it to be; whether it comforts her, illuminates her, challenges her, frightens her, or empowers her. This is her world.  The world in which she actually exists, one just as dark and frightening, is not her world. This is a universal theme that should be experienced by young children, despite the many elements that may make many parents uneasy.    To ease those parents, I suggest they concentrate on the many wonderful educational experiences their child will receive from this film. First, it should be considered as a period film. Kansas: the dress, the mentality, the family dynamic, the living conditions, etc. are all very true to the time the books were written and were something as a child that I found fascinating (something the original is lacking). Second, the musical score is distinctly instrumental, but breathtakingly beautiful and engaging to any child or adult. Third, the story of friendship and loyalty goes beyond helping your friend find their brain and is wrapped up in themes of memory, love, forgiveness, charity, protection, appreciation, gratitude, accountability, the list goes on...    Finally, if you are still not convinced that this movie deserves 5 stars...I suggest giving it another go...or showing it to a lonely nine year old brunette girl, and see how she reacts to it.

1423101472|4.0|As a teacher, I find the whole Percy Jackson series delightful. Students learn mythology through characters they already know and love. I, myself, needed a refresher course on some of the details. These books are high-interest for students and adults alike.     The Last Olympian is the last in the series and it doesn't disappoint. If you're looking for action, this is by far the most exciting in the series. It was nice to see the culmination of all the story elements that had begun all the way back in book 1 (The Lightning Thief). I couldn't put this one down - I had to know what was going to happen!     Mr. Riordan has a statement at the end of this book that makes me think he will write other books about the kids at Camp Half-Blood. I can only hope. These books are some of the best stories I've read in a long time, and I say that as a book-lover AND as a teacher.
0783225857|5.0|Harper Lee's novel, on which the screenplay for this film is based, is one of the very finest American novels.  The film is as fine as the book.  The storyline follows the lives of three children, playmates in an small fictional Alabama County seat town (Maycomb in Maycomb County) where Atticus Finch, an attorney and father of two of the children is working to defend a black man who is falsely accused of the rape of a white woman.  The story deals with honor and dishonor, racism, hatred, bigotry and redeeming love.  It treats with gentle irony and profound moral insight the legal, social and spiritual issues of cruel poverty and heroic moral courage when that poverty, together with stupidity and moral cowardice call for taking the right course even when there is no possibility of victory.  It is a story of the triumph of decency and grace where both are out of keeping with old codes and evil assumptions.  It is a call for courage and a call for courage.

B0025X4P24|4.0|In the liner notes, Vanessa says it took her two years to complete this project.  Well, it certainly was time well spent.  A good selection of songs and arrangements that excellently fit Vanessa's voice.  You'll find a little bit of Latin, a little bit of big band, and a lot of coooool in this set that shows off Vanessa's maturity and growth as an artist.  The duet, October Sky, with Javier Colon is one of my favorites, along with Breathless, The Real Thing, Just Friends and her remake of the Bill Withers classic, Hello Like Before.  She's come a long way from her The Right Stuff days and while this one likely won't take home any Grammys, it's absolutely refreshing lyrically, musically, and stylistically.
B0010X73ZG|4.0|I gave this movie 4 stars because of the ending which I thought was realistic...    Faced with being killed/consumed by those creatures or going out on my own terms, I would have chosen the latter....    Anyway, I liked the fact the movie showed us that as a society no matter how much  we may strive to be better human beings that when fear is involved we are more dangerous to ourselves and others than that which we fear.      I hope that made sense.....    Anyway, the special effects were great, especially the scene near the ending with this monstrous creature which I watched several times because it was so cool!!!     Having not read Stephen King's book, the movie reminded me of the Dean Koontz book I read a while back called, The Taking, which I really liked.        So, overall I recommend this movie...
055358894X|5.0|This was a mixed bag of enjoyment. Some aspects of the storyline you can anticipate, the rest you think you can, then it changes. I really enjoyed this book. I'm still trying to figure out Locke, but that's a good thing for such a complex character. The villains where fantastic, I wanted to reach into the book and strangle them myself. The length of the book was perfect. Some readers of previous reviews found the flashbacks confusing, I found that they fit in perfectly and helped explain the story better as the book progressed. Scott Lynch also nails the details perfect, just enough to help the story along and building the world and characters, but not so much as to bore you. I would highly recommend this book to any of my friends.

There really needs to be a better description of what moves are in each of the segments.
B00129H7VS|4.0|I didn't know what to expect when I purchased Band of Brothers.  It's great story about the horors of war, starting with training, on to Normandy, Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge, the freeing of the concentration camps, and all the way to the Allies Occupation of Germany.  I am not sure it is necessary to purchase Band of Brothers in Blu-ray, but I will enjoy watching it many times.
B001GCUO16|5.0|Lots of hating on this film but I really enjoyed it. Yes, it deviates from the comic books, but I think it is a descent alternate universe-type storyline. Yes, it has unrealistic fight scenes, but come on! It's a comic book superhero. It's all fantasy. And, yes, Wolverine's claws special effects were poor, but...well, I guess there isn't any real excuse for that nowadays. But Sabertooth's claws were well done. The casting was great. I like Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and I especially like that he actually seems to enjoy playing the character and cares about how Wolverine is presented (see the bonus features). Leiv Schreiber is great at Sabertooth. Good match opposite Hugh Jackman and I like the way he runs like a cat when charging. Gambit was also cool and I think he should be the next breakout character. Nice portrayal of Gambit's powers and fighting skills. I wouldn't mind if Deadpool stayed dead, but we know that won't happen, based on the scene at the end of the credits. But best of all, there was finally some well choreographed and excting fight scenes that took advantage of modern technology and special effects....something seriously lacking in the other X-men movies. I hope they make a few more of these. Get the movie, it's a lot of fun. (Just don't take it too seriously.)
0385504225|5.0|How good is \\"The Lost Symbol\\"? Good enough to keep me up till 5 a.m. reading until I couldn't focus my eyes anymore.<br /><br /> Yes, Dan Brown is largely following the formula he established in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". So what? In terms of producing suspense and keeping the reader turning pages, the formula works.<br /><br /> We have the villain, Mal `akh, truly the incarnation of evil. Wealthy, superbly intelligent, strong beyond ordinary mortals, cunning, sadistic and filled with hate. He is a student of the black arts and aspires to acquiring the secrets of the ancients by any means possible.<br /><br /> By now, it is no secret, ancient or otherwise, that it is the Masons who possess the key to the knowledge of the ancients and, lo and behold, that key, if not the secrets themselves, are located in the Washington DC area.<br /><br /> Robert Langdon, the hero of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" receives a call from the assistant to his old friend, Peter Solomon, the chair of the Smithsonian, asking him to fill in on short notice for a speaker scheduled to appear at the nation's Capitol that evening. Langdon, ever the gentleman, agrees to fill in.<br /><br /> Langdon arrives at the Capitol and the \\"fun\\" begins. Now, one has to be careful, particularly with suspense this finely wrought not to drop \\"spoilers\\" and ruin someone else's pleasure.<br /><br /> Langdon quickly finds himself plunged into crisis. There is no speech to be given. Instead there is a severed hand in the Capitol Rotunda, a Capitol Police official and a senior CIA administrator. Langdon is at that the center when he recognizes the hand as belonging to Peter Solomon.<br /><br /> The CIA administrator, Inoue Sato, is a well drawn character. Of Japanese ancestry, she is hard as nails and, putting it mildly, a survivor. Friend or foe? Neither Langdon nor the reader know at this point.<br /><br /> Within a few pages, two more main characters are introduced, the Capitol Architect and Katherine Solomon, sister to Peter.<br /><br /> Now, one by one, author Dan Brown spins out the history of the Masons, their reputed secrets and an amazing outpouring of US history. Browns assures us that all of the organizations and locales he cites are genuine.<br /><br /> Brown deftly leads the reader on a tour of Washington DC that few, if any, of us will ever take through secret rooms and tunnels, to locations laden with history, always with the evil Mal'akh and the CIA on our trail.<br /><br /> There are lots of close calls, heart-thumping narrow escapes, no shortage of impending doom and a few difficult-to-believe, but adrenalin producing, scenarios.<br /><br /> Brown uses an old fiction device: short chapters with a cliff-hanger at the end of each. It may be old, but it works.<br /><br /> All of Brown's characters are richly detailed. Langdon, as he did in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", gnaws at the edge of credibility, with his immense knowledge, but what the heck - he is the hero. Brown employs a clever strategy with Langdon having all the pieces, but reaching the incorrect conclusion the first time around.<br /><br /> Overall, this is just plain good suspense wrapped inside a great thriller. Yes, the formula is within spitting distance of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", but so what? It's good suspense and a very good read.<br /><br />Jerrythe Masons, their reputed secrets and an amazing outpouring of US history.

Brown uses an old fiction device: short chapters with a cliff-hanger at the end of each. It may be old, but it works.     All of Brown's characters are richly detailed. Langdon, as he did in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", gnaws at the edge of credibility, with his immense knowledge, but what the heck - he is the hero. Brown employs a clever strategy with Langdon having all the pieces, but reaching the incorrect conclusion the first time around.     Overall, this is just plain good suspense wrapped inside a great thriller. Yes, the formula is within spitting distance of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", but so what? It's good suspense and a very good read.     Jerry
B002POMLHY|5.0|This is an awesome album from begining to end...a perfect blend of the head pounding heavy stuff that we expect from this great band, as well as a touch of more ballad like melodic songs.  I personally like every song on this album, they are all composed really well and you can tell Ben, being the perfectionist that he is, really worked hard on making sure these songs really flow and deliver on every level.  My personal favorites are; fade away, crawl, hopeless, antem of the angels, and lights out.  Basically this album is a very safe buy for any breaking ben fan both old and new.
B002JM1VJG|3.0|No, I'm not knocking off stars because of missing videos. While I'm sad not to see Bad Girl or the MTV Vogue performance that made it onto the Immaculate Collection, it's not the end of the world since I purchased her previous video collections way back when. This release gets only three stars (and seriously, I'm considering dropping it down to two) because the content looks hideous on an HD tv. I would expect the older stuff (Borderline, Material Girl, etc.) to look a little worse for wear since the technology has come a long way since, but Human Nature? You'll See? Don't Tell Me? They look equally bad to the point where I double checked my HDMI connection and tried popping in another disc to see if my hardware was the problem. Nope - the problem is how both dvds were encoded, i.e. BADLY. Apparently no one at Warner Video has ever heard of an anamorphic transfer. We get forced 4:3 and pixelation galore.<br /><br />Throw in annoying menus (you have to page through multiple screens to select videos from a simple list) and I'm beginning to forget why I wanted this collection in the first place. Madonna has some great videos, but this set is no reason to celebrate. If you have her earlier collections, skip this one and wait for Warner Video to get it right when they no doubt release a mega-set or \\"complete works\\" at some later date.<br /><br />*edited to add*<br />Almost forgot - and I should really take a star off for this - they censored Justify My Love. I also suspect Erotica was  altered as I don't remember some of the scenes being so blurry.
B001H5X7KC|3.0|A friend of mine came over a few months back with a DVD of Tropic Thunder (original cut). I thought it was hilarious, especially the beginning parodies of movie previews. I liked it so much I order this here blu-ray thinking maybe i'll get something extra out of the director's cut. Turns out the extra scenes in the director's cut were cut out of the original for a reason, they aren't funny. Not only that but they hurt the continuity of the movie and the characters. I would have really preferred if watching the theatrical version was an option on this blu-ray but it's not. I'll be trading this for the original on craigslist if there are any takers.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|BB is one of the most talented bands out there. Every record they put out is an experience to be treasured. It took me a while to get into Phobia but this release hit me from the first listen. I don't want to compare but this is just as good as Saturate, that's how good this is.
0385504225|2.0|It's amazing that it took so long after Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons for this book to come out.  It felt as if it were a cheap, Wal-mart knock-off to those exceptional books.  I kept wanting the book to get going and soon found that I was on page 508 and it never did.  Terrible waste of time.
0060574216|5.0|This book presents a lot of information that you already may know but never paid attention to. It is totally worth reading. I recommend reading this book to anyone whom has ever experienced any relationship troubles as it clears up much confusion and explains why it happened in the first place. I personally purchased this book for several friends and now they are in a happy relationships or married  after reading this book. This book has lots of wisdom in it.
6305972591|4.0|It's more eerie than spooky. but other than that it was a good movie and had a good story to it. i'd rent it before i bought it though. The one kid's voice gets on my nerves.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Very excited about this album. AIC has been my favorite band since I became aware of them circa 1994. I really didn't know what to expect with the 13 year hiatus and new lead vocalist, but this album has truly exceeded my expectations.       1. All Secrets Known 8/10 - Great opener. Slow, heavy track. Seemed kinda bland on first listen, but it's grown on me. There's more here than I first thought.    2. A Looking In View 9/10 - The first track to be released from the album back in July. Awesome song all around.     3. Check My Brain 7/10 - This is the radio-friendly rock song of the album. Catchy tune but not all that impressive for AIC. Sort of an advertisement that they have a new album out.     4. Last of My Kind 9/10 - Great heavy rock song. Very cool, Cantrell-ish opening riff. DuVall really shows off his vocals on this one.     5. Your Decision 10/10 - Amazing track. Definite radio single. Likely the \\"hit\\" of the album\\". Great harmonized vocals by Cantrell and Duvall, and very cool lead guitar parts by Cantrell throughout the song.     6. When the Sun Rose Again 9/10 - Very nice acoustic track with harmonized vocals by Cantrell and DuVall. Reminiscent of something off of Sap.     7. Acid Bubble 10/10 - Cantrell at his best. This is the masterpiece of this album. The most impressive arrangement Cantrell has done to date in my opinion.    8. Lesson Learned 8/10 - Catchy medium-pace rock song. Possible radio single.    9. Take Her Out 7/10 - Another medium-pace rock song. I get the feeling DuVall had a hand in this one.     10. Private Hell 9/10 - I really like this track. Another potential radio single. I've heard people say it reminds them of Down in a Hole, but DuVall's layered vocals sound more like Staley's vocals did on \\"I Stay Away\\", though the song \\"flows\\" much more like \\"DIAH\\".    11. Black Gives Way to Blue 10/10 - Again, Cantrell at his best. Song is about LS. Also, Elton John plays a little bit of piano on this one.       Overall, I give the album 5 stars.
1439130833|4.0|I loved reading The Secret and believe it propelled us into the twenty-first century with its focus on our own ability to create our lives.  I further enjoyed the ability to study and forther my own knowing in regards to The Secret and the message of The Secret.  I would recommend it to anyone.
0307266303|5.0|Don't miss this one.  First of all, McDougall is a great writer with a fine sense of humor - there have been many times when I had to set the book down until I finished laughing.  Secondly the whole story is fascinating.  But perhaps most important of all, if you have any interest in running, the book will open your eyes to a whole new view of what running is all about.    Some people have belly-ached in reviews about \\"too much hyperbole\\" or some such nonsense.  They just don't get this writers sense of humor; there is no accounting for taste.  If you liked Rick Reilly's last page articles in Sports Illustrated (back before he vanished into the abyss), you will love McDougall.    This isn't a \\"how to run\\" book by any stretch of the imagination.  It is a great story with some deep insights into running that may very well change your approach. If you are a runner,  you owe it to yourself to read it.  Once again, less is more - a minimalist approach turns out to be the best.  Read the book.
0385504225|3.0|Although this book was interesting, Brown, I feel has two issues with the book. First, I feel he has caught the John Grisham bug in that this reads as if it were written for a screenplay. Yes, a lot of work went into but it was not of the caliber of the \\"DaVinci Code\\" and certainly not \\"Angels and Demons\\" ( which I thought was the better of the two).   Secondly, I just finished the book and although the main \\"action\\" ended , the book goes on for another 30 pages about FreeMason's ideology and other esoteric/religious discussions. A bit, no, quite a bit boring since most of the book was about the same subjects. In my mind this is the Tom Clancy bug...In Clancy's case it's 20 pages on how a submachine gun works.   Glad I read it, but also glad I borrowed it from the library to do so.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This works, I've lost 8 pounds in 2 weeks, with a healthy balanced diet. She is a very motivating personality. You will move, and you find yourself wanting to do it the next day. I get bored very easily so I bought her other workout DVD also, so it would change up the workouts.
0061719544|5.0|In \\"American on Purpose: The Improbable Adventures of an Unlikely Patriot,\\" Craig Ferguson, perhaps best known as the host of \\"The Late Late Show\\" on CBS or as the endearingly mean English boss on \\"The Drew Carey Show,\\" hilariously but poignantly details his journey and the obstacles he has had to overcome in his life to achieve his lifelong ambition--immigrate to the U.S. and work in the entertainment industry. Born in Scotland, Ferguson underwent all the usual problems of adolescence--excessive drinks, drugs, partying, and sets of unsuccessful relationships. He quit school at the tender age of sixteen, mainly just to avoid the bullying, but clueless as to which course to take. Spots in punk rock bands and bartending followed. Ferguson's ultimate foray into the entertainment industry came unexpectedly, as he was working in a Scottish pub one night and one of the customers offered him to participate in a talent contest. After Ferguson successfully completed his first ever stand-up comedy performance, his life took an unexpected but exciting new course. However Craig's alcoholism, depression, and loneliness threatened to ruin it all. Beautifully written, Craig Ferguson's story represents the realization of the ultimate American dream--success in the country where anything is possible. Overall, the book is a very enjoyable read and Craig's story is easy to relate to. I especially enjoyed the second half of the book where Ferguson touched upon the workings of Hollywood and his new American life. I found this book to be inspirational, with Ferguson's life serving as proof for his advice in the beginning of the story--failures, however numerous they might be, are still important parts of the ultimate success.
0670018651|3.0|The book starts off with a couple very interesting and informative essays, but the bulk of the book is mostly reviews of mass market perfumes. Some of the reviews are informative and in-depth; some are brief one liners. The authors are often incisive and funny, and many of the one-liners are very entertaining even if they're not terribly informative. It's a pleasurable read, but if you don't have access to a wide variety of samples to sniff while you're reading, it's tough to get a lot out of it.
0307341569|5.0|One of those rare reads in which I didn't want to put the book down, yet (tried) to pace myself because I didn't want it to end. Wonderful!
0385341008|3.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society was an ok read.  I didn't find it as witty as others did, the characters seemed too stereotypical to me, but many people I know enjoyed the characters and the story.  I did think the ending was a little too pat, things seemed to come together too well, but the book was mildly entertaining and far from the worst I've read in the past few months.  I was intrigued by the backdrop surrounding the story--German occupation of the Channel Islands during World War II.
0439023491|5.0|Bought the series for my daughter's 12th birthday; though the subject matter is intense I couldn't put down these books - cannot wait for the nest one!
B000WAGVHE|5.0|Having seen the original back in the day, I didn't really expect anything new with the remake. I was so mistaken. This movie has a great set of songs that are all very catchy. The blu-ray is very well put together with great picture and sound, and lots of extras. This has become my family's favorite movie. If you like musicals, you will love this.
0688163173|2.0|This book was film noir detective story for the first half. Two US Marshals are sent to a remote island mental hospital/prison for the insane to investigate a missing patient who seems to have vanished from a locked cell/room.<br /><br />The story makes much of the evils of American society in the 1950s, the mandatory little digs at racism and the like that any modern author must include aren't as jarring because of the dark detective doing a tough job at a remote hospital setting the author successfully paints for the first 1/3 of the book.<br /><br />The story slowly changes into a gothic horror and gets worse and worse in writing. By the end of the book, the 'shock ending' is pretty plain and expected. I felt let down that I kept reading when things got dark in the book. The ending was also just too neat and---I want to say smug but that may not be exactly it.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|I knew from the first single I WILL NOT BOW this album would be great BB is my favorite band of all time!! well worth the wait thanks guys for the good music
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|The action, special, effects and acting turn this movie into an all time classic. Heath Ledger's role is excellent. I only hope, even with his early and tragic death, another edition of the Batman series is made. I've heard that the Nolan brothers are working on a 3rd and final of their Batman movies starring Christian Bale but with Johnny Depp playing the villain. I hope it is done as well as The Dark Knight!
B0020MKTOS|5.0|Received the DVD quickly and in great condition.  Would purchase from this seller again.
B002JM1VJG|1.0|This DVD was a WASTE OF MONEY!  The quality looks like cheap bootlets recorded off TV!  What a waste of what could have been a good quality product!  Also - no American Life video on this collection!
B0029LHW4U|2.0|I read somewhere else that somebody called this new record \\"Black Turns To Green\\" as a knock that this is another Jerry Cantrell solo venture. I don't blame the guy for \\"selling out\\" the AIC name to sell records because his solo records did deserve better sales and airplay. You can't really say that the band is tainting the legacy of AIC, because AC/DC and maybe a few other bands were able to pull it off whether their singer died or was just replaced.<br /><br />I liked the new record but could have done without DuVall's singing...particulary lead. He should save it for his \\"Comes With The Fall\\" band. He does a fine job doing harmonizing but his leads and backgrounds (non-harmonizing) just sound too whiney and don't fit in. He does a great job singing the Layne originals live, but that's all he's really good for. (He also comes across as a bit of a poseur with his stage postering, but what can you do?) I just wish he stepped back more and didn't sing lead on any new AIC music. That's the only way it's tainted the legacy in my book. Other than that, they made a few good tunes. I would consider this their worst CD but I don't think it's bad by any means (except for DuVall's \\"Last of My Kind\\" which doesn't belong on this)...it's just okay. This one will need to grow on me through a few more listenings and that's a first for me on anything AIC-related, whether it's their original albums or Jerry's solo discs. Jerry's \\"Degradation Trip\\" was a much stronger record than this one.<br /><br />My biggest wish would have been that the original members had teamed up with Chris Cornell for a new band.<br /><br />EDIT: After several more listenings of this record, I would actually bump it up to a 3 star review. The CD actually grew on me and DuVall's vocals just a bit. I actually like \\"Last of My Kind\\" now, but I still think it doesn't belong on an AIC record.
B001US29I2|5.0|This a great Toy for those of the original Star Wars Fans and their children. It brings back great memories and new ones with our kids
B002AOWXO0|4.0|What makes the album is unfortunately the very thing that may turn off many people to listening to it - the fact that it's a hollywood starlet on the cover.  The thing is, I love Scarlett Johannsen's voice.  She takes this material, which is good in parts, and sends it soaring into another dimension.  She has a unique and easy smooth delivery that suits the retro-poppy sound of this album well.  This is not just another hollywood actress who wanted to create an album of bad singing for her most devoted fans.     The music featured is interesting and catchy.  It is parts adult alternative, lounge, folk, and retro in some places.  \\"Search your Heart\\", \\"Clean\\", and \\"I am the Cosmos\\" are the 3 best tracks.  Overall, the mood is kind of happy-poppy feeling that will cause you to snap your fingers - yes - snap your fingers gaily whilst Pete and Scarlett trade lines.    Oh... speaking of Pete Yorn.... he does a good impression of an angst-ridden sensitive (read... brooding) boyfriend who just got dumped.  Sometimes it works - sometimes it's a little thick.      Overall, a nice surprise and a good listen considering it's an album that I would not have otherwise looked at twice.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Every Whitney Houston release has always been much anticipated, but her last album \\"I Look To You\\", proved to be not only anticipated by her fans, but from music lovers all over the world. The songs are really great, and although they sound contemporary, they will stand the test of time, just like the My Love Is Your Love album did. Highlights: Million Dollar Bill, Call You Tonight, For The Lovers, I Got You and Salute. And of course I Look To You and I Didn't Know My Own Strength are there to remind us that she can sing like no-one else can. Enjoy a great album from a great artist...
B002GZQYMK|3.0|While not as great as their previous record black holes..., it is by no means bad at all. Matt Bellamy and his group provide very effective melodious operatic new-wave derived rock. It is glammy in the best English sense. While it tends to be more on the sensitive side with its use of keyboards, you feel it is a transitional record and that the next one will be great.
B0000648WZ|3.0|I saw this movie in the theatre 12 years ago. What I rememeber the most were the three friends . The jock the tecky and the intellectual.The jock becomes a grunt, the tecky becomes a pilot and the intellectual joins some CIA type organization.Three friends three separate lives. The jock and the tecky I don't mind but its the intellectual who BUGS me. These are the types who  manipulate  society and indiviuals from behind the sccenes.They are the real BUGS.
B002JM1VJG|2.0|Before anyone gets on my case, I HAVE THE DVD and am watching it right now.     Let me start off on a positive note, the DVD set contains 47 videos on 2 DVDs. Some good ones are inexplicably omitted (Dress You Up, Oh Father, Bad Girl, Fever, This Used to Be My Playground, Substitute For Love, Nothing Really Matters, American Life, etc)  but there is a lot of good material released here for the first time. The audio is generally excellent. The 5.1 track is not really a 5.1 mix, it is simulated and sounds terrible. Stick with the PCM stereo track, it sounds fantastic.    I won't comment much on the content of the videos. They are some of the most famous and influential music videos ever made. This is classic stuff. With the exception of Justify My Love (see below) all of the videos are uncut.     Now on to the picture quality...what the hell happened here? It's not as horrible as some people have claimed, but it is WAY below standard. There are serious compression artifacts throughout all of the videos. Pixellation, smearing, graininess, blotchy color, blurring, interlacing artifacts. It's all there and it looks bad. I am watching the DVD on an upscaling Blu Ray player on a 52\\" LCD 1080P television. It won't look as bad on a smaller TV, but it still won't look great. I have honestly seen VHS look better than some of the videos. The Immaculate Collection DVD, which was made from a 19 year old master, looks better.    The problem is that someone made the really, really stupid decision to use single layer DVDs instead of the industry standard dual layer DVDs. I suspect this decision was made late in the process to save a few cents and the program was re-compressed to fit in half the space. There is too much compression and too much picture quality lost. I'll bet the original master was for 2 dual layer DVDs and it probably looked very good. It is hard to believe that anyone at Warner quality control approved the picture quality on these DVDs. Didn't Madonna sign off on arelease copy??    I thought it might have something to do with the age of some of the videos, but the most recent ones look just as bad. The brand new Celebration video only looks slightly better than VHS quality. And it is ridiculous that the widescreen videos are not in 16:9 format, even the recent ones filmed in 16:9 HD are in letterboxed 4:3.    There really is no excuse for this to happen, especially from a company as large as Warner and an artist as big as Madonna. Using single layer DVDs could have only saved them a few cents. On a $30 set, that is inexcusable.    I would strongly suggest not buying this DVD until Warner addresses the situation. I think outcry among the fans will (hopefully) cause Warner to do the right thing and release a corrected version on dual layer discs.    UPDATE - One more thing, the video for Justify My Love is CENSORED! This video was widely released uncensored as a video single in 1991 and sold millions of copies. And NOW, 18 years later, it is censored?? Just unbelievable.     Also, the Amazon description claiming the DVD has \\"unedited and never before seen footage of 'Justify My Love'\\" is completely false. There is no new footage at all. In fact, you actually see less because of the censorship.    If I could split my rating, it would be 4 stars for content and 1 star for quality.
0688145078|5.0|Very pleased with the quality and content of the book.  Just what I needed to read to my grandson who just had a little sister.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|If you like this series, it's a must have and if you have not seen it yet you need too. It's only series since the Soprano's that I whould actualy buy.
0061854549|5.0|Probably the best book I've read yet on behavioral economics. Each chapter is well organized around a specific topic and incredibly thought provoking. I highly recommend it.
B002QNGKGW|5.0|What can I say... if you watched and loved seasons 1-3... season 4 episode 1 continues the fun and thrills.    I didn't watch the episode here due to its editting.  Even though I think the show is still the same length - I think they added in other scenes maybe or maybe it really is just 5 minutes shorter - but to be a free to view episode without having to log in - they must have taken out a lot of the original content out since there was a fair amount of nudity and killing.    Amazon really should have allowed people to either login to view an uneditted version or allowed people to buy that version versus just providing one version that's free and editted heavily.    The rest of the season will probably be available in its original form for purchasing from now on though - hopefully they will be at a reduced price as s1-3 are but I doubt it.
B002HNA95E|5.0|Madonna has given her fans something to celebrate around the world.  While many things make Madonna great, it's her authentic Pop music that has kept her on the music charts for 26 years and counting.  While there are some songs left out of her greatest hits collection, it is still an excellent collection of Madonna's best work plus 2 great new singles!      While the first single \\"Celebration\\" didn't get much airplay in the US, it still managed to find it's way to #1 on the Dance Charts, making it her 40th #1 single on that chart.  \\"Revolver\\" featuring Lil' Wayne is her second release.  The single should get good airplay because of it's R&B vibe, lyrics and strong hook.    If anyone is waiting to get every song of hers in one collection, come back in 20 years.  Madonna is still creating good music and delivering it well.  Hats off to Lady Madonna.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|It's been too long.  I give credit to William DuVall for his contribution to this music without taking away the classic AIC sound.  This album is top shelf in my opinion and will sit nicely along side my other AIC discs.  Maybe now the band can put out new material on a regular basis without waiting year after year for Layne to get his drug habit in order.  Don't get me wrong, I love Layne Staley, but he drove the band into the ground (and himself).  Very sad.  I love this disc and look forward to seeing them live and hopefully new music in the not so distant future.   It's not fair to the band or yourself if you are so narrow minded to think that the only person that mattered in the band was Layne.  The band tastefully added William DuVall years before recording this cd to be sure that he is an honorable fit. And fit in he does, not as replacement, but as an addition to the band.   Do yourself a favor and check it out.    Cheers!!    Metalfan
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I remember waiting in anticipation as I waited for Advent Children to release in the US a few years ago.  When I finally had a chance to watch it, I was extremely happy.  The Universe of Final Fantasy VII is one that many gamers in the US cherish and love to revisit.  That said, over the past 2 years, the DVD hasn't aged all that well.  When watching the DVD on a Blu-Ray player that upscales, the picture is noticeably fuzzy.  However, I was once again happy when I heard that there would be a Blu-Ray release of Advent Children that hopefully would satiate my desire for a higher-res version of this fantastic movie.      Picture - 9  Oh the glory of Blu-Ray.  The images during Advent Children are fantastic.  The texture of the fabrics and the crispness of the vistas visited during the movie, even during quick-moving sequences, look incredible.  There really isn't a better example of a realistically animated move that I have come across.  And in the Blu-Ray version, the visuals are made even better by adding things that wouldn't originally fit on the DVD copy.  Now the world looks even more realistic with dirty children and items and clothing that gradually become more and more worn and deteriorated throughout the film.      Sound - 8  Well, it's honestly about the same.  The voice acting is fantastic, though I insist on only watching the film with subtitles, since I can't stand English dubbing.  However, for those familiar with the franchise, there are some great variations on some of the main FFVII themes that many will enjoy.  Don't assume that since the sound hasn't changed that it is bad.  It was great to begin with, and still is.    Blu-Ray -9  Ah, what a good Blu-Ray.  I have to say that I am delighted to see that Sony has decided to implement the idea of the onscreen menu.  So many Blu-Rays hurt themselves by not including this feature.  Being able to pull up the menu while watching the movie at the same time is a little feature that goes a long way.  There areseveral inclusions on this disc that make it fun.  For those who are interested, there is a nice expose about Final Fantasy XIII that comes along with the Blu-Ray that provides a nice intro to the upcoming game.  There is also a short animated film about Denzel that some might find interesting, though it is probably one of the weaker elements on the Blu-Ray.    Deleted Footage - 10  I gave this facet of the release it's own section because in all honesty, most of the people who re-buy the movie on Blu-Ray are purchasing it for this reason, and also because the deleted footage goes a long way in making Advent Children much more accessible to those who aren't familiar with the Final Fantasy VII universe.  I've longed to show Advent Children to family and friends to showcase the incredible animation and motion-capturing that went into this movie, but found that when they attempted to watch the film, they were confused and left in the dark about the storyline.  I eventually stopped trying to show the film to those unfamiliar with the franchise, because the movie doesn't offer much explanation as to who the characters are, what the backstory is, etc.  However, the additional 26 minutes included in Advent Children bridges the gap between a fan film and a feature film that most people can enjoy.  Much more is explained, and the overall experience, though a few minutes longer, feels much better overall and more thorough.      Final Thoughts  If you have never seen Advent Children and are interested in either the Final Fantasy VII universe, or you are simply interested in some of the best realistic-looking animation yet to hit film, Advent Children will be right up your alley.  This film provides not only an amazing update to an already great production, but now also presents a complete film to the public that is no longer limited to a niche audience.
B001FBIPF0|5.0|I bought this album in the store, because I was curious as to what could ever top the last album (Infinity On High, fantastic album btw), I was slightly differnt, I found my self immediately falling in love with \\"I Don't Care\\", \\"Coffees For Closers\\", and \\"Tiffany Blews\\", but this entire album, pieced together was some of their best, with all the chaos, ironclad tight harmonies, it's an album, I can dance to, I can Run to, or just sing out loud, (though quite off key some times). Totally recommend this album to anyone looking for something fun the listen to.
0441013074|4.0|This book is not set in the Revelation Space universe like Amazon claims.     It is a detective story on 2 levels, has a good pace. However the motivations of the antagonists are not clear and thus do not make much sense. Still, this is a good book like most from AR.
0307454541|4.0|Yes it's a fun read--and with a surprisingly feminist message beneath the almost unbearably misogynistic crimes. But it's as though Larsson used up all his character-building mojo on Lisbeth. Most other characters--the bad guys in particular--pale by comparison. I'm dreaming of a mashup with Hannibal Lechter.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I typically don't watch a lot of movies but I have a few friends who had been talking this one up for a while, I thought I would be dissapointed especially with the negative reveiws it had received from movie critics and some of the general public, but I was very impressed with story line and the characters.  I know some people have said its boring, I guess that being said we do live in the Ritalin capitol of the world and the story is a little more complicated than a bald guy in a wheelchair hanging out with a guy from Canada who has razor blades in his forearms smashing, slashing, and blowing up everything in site  (I liked those movies too). The plot was a little darker than most but I thought there was enough action to keep it going, and the plot makes sense if you pay attention or if you have an IQ even marginally above room temperature.  I realize its all a matter of opinion but to just say that the movie \\"sucked\\"  Because it was to long, or the plot didn't make sense (How didn't it make sense?)  Doesn't really help anyone trying to make a rational decision, if there are any issues in understanding the plot its probably due to the \\"what if\\" scenario, like what if these people had been real and they had been sent to Veitnam for example if you don't know your history then this will confuse you because 50ft tall blue men who could will people into exploding did not bring the Veit cong to their knees and win the war for America. So if your interested in buying this rent it first, I will purchase this movie around Christmas I guess a better edition will be hitting shelves then.
0385504225|1.0|I have read all of Dan Brown's books,and enjoy most of them. The Lost Symbol is a Lost Cause. Within the first 30 pages the telepgrpahing of the story was obvious, as were all major plot points.    There is nothing new in the book.    Boring.    Don't buy it - if you must read it borrow from someone, get form the library, buy used on eBay....Mr. Brown called this one in.
B0025KVLTC|4.0|First off let me say that I have heard the all the original Beatles albums to CD. The originals do not sound bad. Some people said they sounded dull. Well, if you listen to music on a sub par or low end sound system everything will sound dull.      These remasters do bring out the clarity from the master tapes. Just about everything in the mix on this album is pretty clear. My only gripe is some of the drum fills, toms, and symbols are now buried in the mix on this album.     The packaging is very nice though. You get more photos here, and interesting liner notes. Some of the liner notes are too technical for the average listener to understand. I find the stuff interesting since I consider myself a novice audiophile.      I must say the sound is improved here enough to warrant new fans to buy the remasters. Old fans seem to dislike these new remasters. Not owning any Beatles albums aside from Let it Be..NAKED. I had to buy this and a few others.     If EMI/Capitol is wise to release the albums from Sgt. Peppers onward in 5.1 that would be great. Hearing those albums in 5.1 sound would be a great experience. It would def provide a higher sampling rate. As long as the mixer does not use too much compression.     All in all I give this album 4 stars. It could have sounded better if the mixer or whatever let up on the compression. The packaging and liner notes are interesting. If you are a new fan of The Beatles get these remasters!
B001GCUO1Q|2.0|Yeah, about \\"X-men Origins: Wolverine,\\" I liked the characters,... in the comic books.  I am an artist, and I truly appreciate when someone uses their imagination to the fullest extent possible, so in that sense, good movie. If you are collecting X-Films, add it. Otherwise, rent first.  There is plenty of action in it.  The actors did a fine job.  Liev Schrieber is always cool, and Hugh Jackman is dynamite as an actor (My opinion: He seems a bit too \\"broadway\\" for this role, although he most likely is the best choice for the role)...     However, I don't appreciate when someone tries to fix something that is not broken. All that time and money put into writing a script for arguably the most popular comic book character, and you change his origin?  I'm sorry, I don't understand.  You know what I say, \\"It's been already done, why do it again?\\"  Barry Windsor Smith, Paul Jenkins, Joe Quesada, and all of the collective minds that gave Wolverine his background in the comics, which just so happens to be the background that made him so popular, did a fantastic job.  Why switch it up?    When I say \\"switch it up,\\" I mean shuffle very fundamental details.  Let's say they were planning to release movies based on your favorite childhood superheroes... Only thing is, some of them were slightly different that what you would've imagined...  Like what if Superman wasn't really bulletproof?  What if Batman's parents actually died in a car accident along with Alfred?  What if Spiderman actually looked like a big hairy spider?  What if the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles weren't even ninjas?  What if the Flash was a woman?  These aren't necessarily major changes, but why would they even be necessary?  And if not readily explained within the story, then you've got lovely plot holes throughout the movie.    For example:  1. Where did he get his name Logan?  2. If Creed is his brother, why don't they share the same name? (This was explained in comics, but not in film.)  3. Adamantium bullets erase his memory?... I won't even touch that one   4. Gambit was pointless in this film. The least important character, along with Blob, and the Emma Frost clone... pointless...  5. Deadpool, although a great character, was ruined. (swords out of his hands? cmon)  6. Wolverine ran out of the base fully competent, but in a flashback in X2, he was covered in blood, and incoherent... How?  7. I guess he was never part of Department H, or Alpha Flight, or in Japan with Ogun, or Shingen, toss that out the door... (This could've became another movie all in itself, but now it'll never happen.  8. He learned how to fight from gettn almost killed and surviving his entire life? Is that it? Okay...  9. Rose, the redhead from his childhood, and the reason why he can't get enough of Jean Grey, was never there  10. Why introduce soooo many cool characters, without doing them the justice of some backgroud? It made the film a bit \\"busy\\"    Things like these are what demolished the previous 3 X movies...   \\"Batman Begins,\\" based on the \\"Batman: Year One\\" comic  \\"Hellboy\\" very similar to the comic  \\"Watchmen\\" flawless, except for the excessive nudity. Right out of the pages of the comic book. (graphic novel)  \\"Road to Perdition\\" one of my favorite movies, a graphic novel...  It seems like the closer they stick to the original comic book script, it seems to always make a great movie.    I will say that in the vain of all the other X movies, it measured up.  But nobody is perfect.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I caught this series on the Ovation channel. I was disdainful but curious and watched the show ready to hate it. I ended up loving it instead. The actors are outstanding, the story is very creative and there are little twists and changes in some of the characters that we have come to love and hate from Pride and Prejudice. I was ready to hate Amanda (the modern, dropped in character) and ended up falling in love with her. She was combination of softness and strength and had the brashness of a modern girl, I often fantasize about when reading a period novel. Not quite in your face but very straightforward.    I apologize to P&P die-hard fans, but I was very glad that Elizabeth was not in the series that much. I have always found her to be irritating but the actress that plays her is quite lovely and what I imagined Elizabeth to look like. If you are into Lizzie, this may not be the series for you.    Word of advise though. When purchasing, check you DVD asap. I'd purchase this DVD straight from Amazon and my copy is missing Amanda's performance of \\"Downtown\\". It wasn't a skip, but a complete cut of this scene. I stopped watching it because I frankly did not want to find any other scenes missing.    However, I did give the series a 5 star rating because the series itself is sensational.    If you are a die-hard fan of P&P, I hope you are open because this is a lovely fantasy for anyone that has ever wanted to be with Mr. Darcy.
B00288KNJU|5.0|entertaining creative family movie not just for kids, the use of the 3d effect was well done but not over played. story was easy to follow with a few dark moments for adults to appreciate what is another fantastic entry into modern stop motion movie making. the casting was quite effective especially terri hatcher in regards to the animation of her character in the back end of the movie and french and saunders as the older lady neighbors was very good. not wanting to go into the storylines too much all characters are fleshed out well and the story makes sense.
B001GCUO16|1.0|With a horrible script, shoddy CGI and and complete bastardization of some of my favorite comic book characters(for God's sake, there's not even continuity between the previous X-films!), X-Men-Ridiculous Title:Wolverine goes down as one of the worst summer blockbusters in recent history, if not of all time.  Avoid at all costs, true believers.
0385504225|5.0|This book is so interesting with the science and symbolism. And he's got really good at suspense. Every chapter ends with a cliffhanger. So many surprises! You can't put it down! And the end is so moving!
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Not that much has happened in the last 14 years before the last Alice In Chains record. Not much really. Ok, so original lead singer Layne Staley finally succumbed to his severe drug problems. Five years later the band is touring with a new singer and surprisingly a new album is released. Well, almost released. I got an advance copy.    So where do things start off? \\"Hope. A New Beginning\\" sings Cantrell from the opening line of the lead off track All Secrets Known. The song is slow, dark and moody. The vocals are haunting. Wait, I thought they had a new singer? Seems Cantrell's vocals are sounding even better with age. The sound becomes even more familiar at 2:25 with vocal chants that only this band could ever pull off.    Check My Brain is a 4 minute straight up rocker that at times sounds like a faster version of Pantera's 10's. That is until you hear the chorus of this second single. \\"California, I'm fine. Somebody Check My Brain.\\" DuVall and Cantrell harmonize so brilliantly, it's hard to get the song out of your head. Reminiscent is the classic Alice In Chain's use of \\"Oh Yeah\\" after almost every verse. Also haunting is the use of the lyric 'By The Way'. Or maybe that's because I can still hear Staley singing it on their self titled third album from 14 years ago. The song has already hit number one on the Billboard Chart and is a good indication of what is to come.    Three tracks in and the question that's been floating around is finally answered. So how's the new guy? DuVall takes all leads on Last Of My Kind with a crisp solid voice that only just misses the classic Staley level of eeriness by the narrowest of margins. The song chugs. It's heavy. It curses and it solos. It's fresh, too.    Perhaps unintentional is the title of the next track as it almost imposes what one thought of DuVall. It's Your Decision. Alice In Chains were always known for great acoustic work and this is no exception. Simple strummed chords that any guitarist could easily play around a camp fire. The chords are laid back until the break down with what sounds like a melody of redemption remembering Staley. \\"No one plans to take the path that brings you lower\\" sings Cantrell as the song ends on a chord that sums it all up in a nutshell.    A Looking In View is the first single off the album and a bit of a lengthy choice but is the perfect way to show the way Cantrell and DuVall can harmonize to create that dark and gloomy haze that Alice was always known for. Slow and sludgy, this grunge song by an original grunge band of the 90's beats any knock off of a band that came after. The only thing missing in the song is a complimentary solo. Perhaps that would have filled what was missing in the gap of this 7:06 and longest track of the album.    The disc slows down again with it's second acoustic track titled When The Sun Rose Again. Kinney's percussion adds a new dimension to the dark haunting harmonized vocals which at times really do sound like Staley himself. Again, the chorus is slightly uplifting but what is truly beautiful is the solo which breaks the song in two and comes across as a left over outtake solo from GNR's Estranged.    Acid Bubble could easily have been a track from the their self titled album as it sounds like an outtake that has been put into perfection (Frogs? Sludge Factory anyone?) while the lyrics are penned more in a style that makes one think of '92's Dirt. Again the dark harmonies are beautiful but it's Inez's bass playing that really gives this song the dark and moody feel Alice In Chains fans have been missing.    The album picks back up the beat on the 8th track, a song that out right rocks out. As we approach the end of the album, it becomes evident that Cantrell is in full control of this band and no longer shrouded by Staley's eroding addiction. Perhaps A Lesson Learned.    Easily the weakest track on the record is Take Her Out but that is not to say that the song is filler. A slow rockin' groove that seems like a flash back to the days of Facelift, this song is just simply over shadowed by the previous and upcoming tracks.    The latter is quickly forgotten as Private Hell rings in with a catchy arpeggiated riff. DuVall again compliments Cantrell's gloomy lyrics with follow up lines like \\"I'll move on\\" and \\"Life is Short\\" as they agree with some \\"un huhs\\". The background leads are typical in Alice In Chains fashion and one shouldn't expect anything less. But where this song truly shines is the solo. Cantrell shows the listener that a solo doesn't have to be a million notes per second to be effective, soothing and touching as it once was on such classics as Them Bones and Man In The Box.    Save the best for last? Perhaps the greatest track on the record is also Alice In Chains' greatest ballad to date. The title track pays tribute to Staley with straight to the point/straight to the heart lyrics as Cantrell sings \\"Tomorrow's haunted by your ghost. Lay down, Black gives Way To Blue. Lay down, I'll remember you.\\" As if the background leads weren't enough to set the mood, legend pianist Sir Elton John compliments the song beautifully as the album closes to an end.    Seems to me that Alice has found the missing link to their chains as black really does give way to blue.
B002JM1VJG|1.0|Poor picture quality.  Absolutely no remastering has been done to ANY of the video.  5.1 Audio track is misleading: same audio slapped onto surround speakers that are on the front speakers.  Worst of all: JUSTIFY MY LOVE IS CENSORED.  Maybe years from now after Madonna has passed away, Warner Brothers will see fit to release a properly done video box set.  Cuz this ain't it folks.  Save your [...] bucks!

B002ELM5HY|2.0|... the real Mark Knopfler--the Mark Knopfler of \\"Golden Heart\\" and \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\"--is alive and well aboard the mothership. He sends his best to his fans and hopes to be returned to Earth soon.    Frankly, \\"Get Lucky\\" is the second disappointment in a row for this diehard Knopfler fan. \\"Kill to Get Crimson\\" was moribund, and most of the stuff on this CD sounds like he's aiming for the celtic music crowd. Nothing wrong with celtic music, of course: I love it. But we've come to expect so much more from Mark. Even more disappointing is the lack of any real guitar wizardry. He's gone from making a Stratocaster cry and sing to a strumming style fit for the local open mic night.     Perhaps I'm being hard on Mark--he is, after all, well into his 60s, so it's quite possible the old fizz isn't there anymore. Which is perfectly fine--Knopfler has a remarkable body of achievement behind him, and he's more than earned the title of \\"legend.\\"     But color me sad over the end of an era.
B0029LHW4U|3.0|The reviewer who stated that this sounded more like \\"Jar of Flies\\" was dead on!  I prefer the AIC sound of \\"Facelift\\", \\"Dirt\\", or \\"3 legged dog(self titled)\\".  Thats why I gave the low rating.  I like about half the album.  I love \\"A Looking View In\\".  It sounds like old school Chains.  You should definitely pick this up if you're an AIC fan.  ***I saw Duvall perform with AIC in 2006 and he sounded excellent.  Show your support for Chains and go see Jerry and the boys at a concert near you!  They still sound great live!

0385504225|1.0|I've never written a book review on amazon.com, so for me to take the time to do so tells how badly I hated the ending. A good portion of the book was very entertaining, although tedious for all the reasons reviewers have mentioned. I was still enjoying it when I got within about 10 pages of the end. When I got there, however, if it hadn't been a library book I would have torn it to shreds and thrown it around the room, or maybe put the tattered pieces in my cats' litter box. The build up to this great revelation, so mind-blowing that the CIA was involved to protect all the mere mortals from knowing it and changing the universe as we know it . . . well, all I can say is it was ludicrous and dishonest. Does Mr. Brown, his publisher, his editor, etc., have so little respect for readers that they thought the ending was a pay-off to all that build up? They can't be that stupid. They should all donate the money they earned to a charity.
B0021L8US0|5.0|This movie is great, anybody who gives it less than 4 stars doesn't know what they're talking about. Also people who moan about camera shake are just plain dumb, they're the sort of people who ask questions throughout films because they don't know whats going on.
B0001HLVS2|4.0|I was unclear with what was the purpose of this story. What was Captain Jack trying to do? The movie flirts with a Captain Ahab theme. Is Captain Jack obsessed with a  formidable foe? Has he rejected reason for the pursuit for French ship Acheron, his Moby Dick? There are allusions to the albatross and the curse of Jonah. Another neglected theme was the relationship that developed between Lucky Jack and Dr. Stephen Maturin. The doctor has scientific ambitions that would have permitted him to beat Charles Darwin to the punch. However, each time he is promised an opportunity to explore the Galapagos, Captain Jack pulls out to pursue his military duties. The relationship briefly presents the case that our wars have prevented us from progressing as a culture. That could have been cool, but then changes direction. In the end, the cohesive theme is that Captain Jack is a superhero mariner who can do no wrong. Even during his brief displays of obsession, the crew seems to collectively roll their eyes in a knowing manner. Even when overmatched, he cannot lose. And what is the deal with the doctor and captain playing their violin and cello sideways like guitars at the end? Is this Hollywood's effort at revisionist history to bestow rock'n'roll star status to century old heroes?<br /><br />I can not say enough about the technical points of this movie. Visually authentic. Dramatically engaging.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|When I first watched this movie I loved it, so I got myself a copy.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|Been following these guys since they're first album. It is so hard to say this is the best album because every album they come out with is so good. The difference with this CD is every song when I listen to it sends chills down my spine. The creativity is through the roof on this CD, and the way its crafted and setup feels so different then any CD I have ever listened to. Every CD they have made is a 10 in my book, but this CD is definetly an 11. Also this is the only band I have ever listened to besides RED(but they only have 2 cds out)who consistently comes out with great CD after great CD. BB you guys out did yourself on this album GREAT JOB!!!!

1601251505|5.0|If you are looking for a replacement of your Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 ruleset, and the 4th Edition seems too wacky or video-gamish for your tastes, then Pathfinder is your new home. This core rulebook is packed, and I mean packed, with every rule and clarification you could ask for. It is the Players Handbook and GM Guide combined! It improves on the 3.5 rules, smotthing things out, streamlining them some, but still retaining the feel I loved from D & D.<br /><br />If you liked 3.5 but wish they'd have updated, cleaned and strealined it, pick up Pathfinder!

B000001FS3|5.0|For 'The Joshua Tree', U2 toned down some of the artier experiments of 'The Unforgettable Fire', while still retaining that album's atmospheric, reflective mood. Instead, they begin to incorporate American roots rock into their signature sound, especially elements of folk and country rock. While 'The Unforgettable Fire' had a couple of good songs, it also had its fair share of directionless filler, while here there is not a single weak song. The end result is an album just as ambitious as its predecessor, but far more consistent.     The typical anthemic U2 sound is most evident on the first three songs, which also became the three big hit singles; 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For', 'With Or Without You', and in particular the surging opener 'Where The Streets Have No Name', one of the best lead-off tracks for an album ever written. 'In God's Country' is another fairly straightforward anthem. In contrast, the most explicit incorporation of American music is the country-tinged 'Trip Through Your Wires', complete with sqwarking harmonica and steel guitar. 'Running To Stand Still' and 'Mothers Of The Disappeared' are very sober, restained laments for a drug addict and political prisoner respectively. At the other end of the scale, the pounding 'Bullet The Blue Sky' contains some of U2's heaviest music and lyrics, while the claustrophobic 'Exit' is downright distrubing.     In some ways it's a bit surprising that 'The Joshua Tree' was such as massive commercial success, since it is not a particularly immediate or optimistic album, nor is it an easy listen. However, from an artistic viewpoint U2 are in top form, trying a number of new things and writing really strong songs. I personally think 'Achtung Baby' just shades this album, since it was an even more radical departure that worked just as well. But 'The Joshua Tree' is still an excellent album, one of U2's very best.     Five stars.
B002G1X34G|5.0|I've had this since the European release, but had to wait to post my review today. I own EVERYTHING by this band...full length, eps, and singles. This is by far the best collection of songs ever relased by Leaves' Eyes. I'm not going to bother with a track-by-track breakdown, but will point out tracks I feel are the best (IMO) on this album.    *Emerald Isle - Liv's vocal intro is something that other female vocalists could only dream of singing.  *Take The Devil in Me - my 2nd favorite on this album  *Scarborough Fair - a very serene amazing song  *Through Our Veins - IMO the best song this has to offer    Other than that this WHOLE album is a masterpiece.

Still, it is a decent disc if you want to get pumped up and motivated.<br /><br />DOES ANYONE ELSE SPOT THE MAJOR RIP-OFF SONG ON THIS CD? Is it just me or is \\"Never Enough\\" a TOTAL RIP-OFF of \\"Whatever\\" from Godsmack (their first self-titled cd)? The tempo is nearly exact and the lyrics deal with the same issues of liking yourself no matter what anyone else thinks.<br /><br />Until then brothers and sisters...
B00288KNJU|5.0|Spectacular transfer for the Blu-Ray, a great reason to own a HDTV with a good Blu-Ray set up.  Audio is great on the Blu-Ray, the thunder storms and other effects drove my dogs insane... Usually a good measure of quality.    Overall package is great... I wish all the Blu-Ray releases would come like this.  Blu-Ray + DVD + Digital... I love it and would be thrilled to find more movies packed in this manner.... As long as the price point isn't insane, its easily worth 2 or 3 bucks to me and you know it doesn't cost the producer of product that much to press a DVD and include a download code.    Great package overall, and great film, one of my favorite Blu-Ray releases yet.  This is the set I grab when I want to show someone the difference between DVD and Blu-Ray.
B002BFIN6K|5.0|I own this CD and plan on giving it as a gift to everyone at Christmas. Zenph has gotten better with this selection as the power and tenderness of Rachmaninoff's playing is crystal clear. I love this disk. Highlights include the binaural verison for headphones which puts you at the bench where Rachmaninoff sat and you hear the performance as he heard it. It is astounding.    Buy this CD and fall in love with Rachmaninoff all over again.    Jeff M in NYC
B002FRNCG0|4.0|I'm not a big fan of Paramore per se but when they released \\"Riot!\\" I found myself attracted to their music. Somehow, I found that album \\"too comercial\\" from what I like but still some songs were pretty enjoyable (\\"That's what you get\\" is by far my favorite). I was intrigued about the release of this album and hesitating as well cause I didn't know if I should buy it. Well, I decided to go for it and my first impression of this new record is that \\"I love all the facts that make other reviewers hate it\\". Yes, this is not as catchy as \\"Riot!\\" and here there are no smash hits as the way they were in that album but, while everybody hates that I just love it. I find Paramore trying not to repeat themselves while they're playing these songs and eventhough they end up to DO repeat themselves in most of the songs... I appreciate the effort they make (songs like \\"Careful\\", \\"Brick by boring brick\\" and \\"Turn it off\\" are some ecamples of this). On the other hand, eventhough the lyrics are light and for a teenage style (which is ok considering that Hayley Williams is still in her teenage years someway, somehow) by moments Hayley finds clever lines to say and most of all, pretty much honest in comparison to the bunch of crap that new bands say these days in their lyrics. For this matter I consider worth to mention what she says on the song \\"Feeling sorry\\" (....I feel no symphaty, you live inside a cave, you barely pass by, the rest of us are trying, there's no need to apologize, there's no time for feeling sorry.... all the best lies are told with fingers tied).<br /><br />Musically, I find Paramore's style afraid of experimenting how their songs would sound without the \\"has-to-be distortioned-sound\\" i think if they try to experiment a little bit more with their guitars they might find better results on their songs. Of course, this is still a new band we're talking about here (only 3 albums recorded) hence, I'm expecting that they do an album like \\"Brand new eyes\\" nowadays in 2009. I just hope that in their future they find themselves in a different mental state and a different aura around them to get inspired to come up with their best album. Honestly, I have never cared much about bands from their generation (Fall out boy, panic at the disco, the academy is...) just because i just don't waste my time listening to pretencious,shallow songs about teennage love from a bunch of kids saying nothing at all while they're playing too loud to hide the fact that they SUCK but, Paramore has something that any of these bands have.... passion and love for making music that they like. Just remember that that is how bands like The Smiths or R.E.M. started (not that I'm comparing them though).9.

0385504225|2.0|I loved The Davinci code, and Angels & Demons but I did not love The Lost Symbol because it was just dysfunctional. Dan Brown usually keeps you guessing with red herrings and little hints that do not pan out. I loved the travel around Europe that was involved in the Davinci code even if it was a bit forced I granted him that. Angels & Demons travels through Rome and inside the Vatican kept me on the edge of my seat but I had to force myself to finish The Lost Symbol. I will still continue to buy Dan Brown books because I believe he has it in him to continue Langdon's great adventures, but I cannot recommend this book to anyone.
0385040253|5.0|This is definitely one of the most amazing, interesting, and educational books that I have viewed.  I purchased it for my son and grandson for Christmas (2009), but I have found myself looking through it to admire the handiwork of the author.  Never did I imagine that there could be so many different types of knots and applications.  Even though the book has been in print for many years, I only learned about it recently from a program on television.  Still very applicable today as when it was published.

0756404746|4.0|The first time I started The Name of the Wind I got distracted by other things about two thirds of the way through and put it aside for several months.  At that point I was not particularly a fan of the book, probably because I had not particularly come to like the main character.  When I came back to it I started back at the beginning, and had the time to read it through to the end over a few days.  Now I find myself going back and re-reading sections, almost at random, finding the little bits I missed before.  Though I have come to despise the phrase, I have been rereading so I can \\"connect the dots\\".  I am finding there are a lot of dots, more than I saw the first time through, more than I have found yet.    If you are looking for relaxed entertainment, just taking your mind out of gear and letting the story carry you, this book will probably leave you unsatisfied.  If you require that the significance of something has to relate to the number of pages devoted to it, well you will probably gloss over (as I did at first) the most significant points.  On the other hand if you are prepared to devote some attention to the complexities that are there to be noticed you may find that the book captures you.  If you pick up on half the hints and portents that are scattered everywhere, and start to fit them together, you may well end up (as I have) champing at the bit for the next book so you can get a few answers (and another bunch of mysteries).
B000NQRE0K|5.0|Screen favorite Mel Gibson triumphs in front and behind the camera in the award-winning 1995 historical epic \\"Braveheart\\". In 13th century Scotland, hardworking William Wallace (Gibson) is more concerned in being a farmer and starting a family than standing to the oppressive rule of King Edward I (Patrick McGoohan). When his childhood sweetheart (Catherine McCormack) is brutally murdered as a warning against further uprisings, Wallace leads his countrymen to liberation, marking the forefront of the first war of Scottish Independence. \\"Braveheart\\" is a thrilling movie spectacle that ranks along side such grand historical epics like \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" and \\"Spartacus\\". The film superbly combines elements of rousing action and moving drama. The battle scenes are impressive. Mel Gibson delivers a first-rate performance. The cast also includes Angus Macfadyen, Brendan Gleesan, Brian Cox and Sophie Marceau. \\"Braveheart\\" won five Academy Awards including best cinematography, best director and best picture.<br /><br />\\"Braveheart\\" Sapphire Edition will surely be one of your favorite titles in your Blu-Ray collection. The award-winning film is presented in a fine 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture quality isn't perfect bit it's certainly a noticeable upgrade over the DVD. The HD transfer boasts some pretty good detail in some key scenes. Its 5.1 Dolby TrueHD audio offers great clarity and dynamic surround effects. Among special features, the Blu-Ray contains the same ones included in the 2-disc special edition DVD: an audio commentary track with director/actor Mel Gibson and two behind-the-scenes featurettes. The second disc has a 59-minute 3-part \\"Braveheart: A Look Back\\" documentary and an interactive map that allows the viewer to learn more about the famous battles depicted in the film. Overall, \\"Braveheart\\" Sapphire Edition scores an \\"A\\".
B00002DE4E|2.0|2 1/2    Even with the momentous influence behind it, this minimalist post-punk is one of those albums that simply cannot stand up to any esteemed reputation in my ears, with hardly any of the repetitious detachment seeping into internal resonance, coming across as tautly sterile instead.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|Before purchasing this product, I read many of the reviews on it- including the negative ones.  Now that I have the Real Triggers on my PS3 controller, I do not understand many of the negative comments.  These are great.  They do not use adhesive, they eliminate the accidental button press that occurs when the controller is set down, and they make the controller more responsive. For the price, they are a great addition and can be removed and replaced as needed.  Much better than the adhesive ones out there.
B0000013GT|3.0|3 1/2    Although it would take another album until this dynamic hip-hop duo would seemingly solely reinvigorate the genre, ATLeins represents them, and consequently rap, at its late-old-school best.
B000YENUI6|5.0|Vory v zakone - Thieves in law.     This movie left me very pleased, the script is very good, nothing is over explained but every thing connects. There is a constant threat of menace all through the movie and the portrait of the Russian mafia is dark and sinister, not the men to be trifled with, in fact stay away.     So it is no place for a warm hearted midwife looking for the origins of a new born baby. Her investigations take her face to face with the inner circle of the mafia, a place no one should go. Drugs, assassinations, human trafficking, prostitution - it is a dark world that shuns the light and attention.     With strong preformances by Naomi Watts, Viggo Mortensen and Vincent Cassel it is the script that shines through. The directing is good and when there is violence it is no holds barred and all the time the potential for more is just below the surface.     It is a good and believable film. Highly recommended.
B002C6K7NA|4.0|This a good CD, the only reason for missing the last star is that I liked Vicious Cycle better, but this is very good, it has a pretty wide style of the songs so most people can find something to like, \\"Still unbroken\\" and \\"The Storm\\" are the best songs but the rest is not far behind.    People that complain about Lynyrd Skynyrd tend to be people that liked the \\"old\\" Skynyrd, the same thing exists for example with AC/DC, Brian vs. Bon, I think Lynyrd Skynyrd is just getting better and better for each CD, Twenty, Edge Of Forever, Vicious Cycle and God & Guns are among the best CD's they have made through the years.
B00000JQFL|5.0|This album, unlike any other, truly shows why Earth, Wind and Fire were a historic band and laid down grooves like no one before or since.  One of my favorite albums by the Mighty Elements, you get a chance to hear them in their truest element, on stage.  One of the greatest strengths of Earth, Wind & Fire was their outstanding musicianship! Guitars, drums, percussion, bass, keyboard & piano and of course, the Mighty Phenix Horns!<br /><br />Many other well known artists would attend their concerts, as well as their millions of fans, to see what they would come up with next.  It was truly an \\"event\\" to witness them perform on stage and something the listener and viewer would never forget.  Unlike most live shows, they would take a song they recorded on their albums and bring a whole new way of experiencing it on stage.  Maurice was never satisfied with the status quo and always was looking to \\"push the envelope\\" and go beyond what might be expected.<br /><br />He worked with and incorporated suggestions from magic artist like David Copperfield into their shows to make it an event so the attendee would get their money's worth and truly enjoy the entire experience.  They were one of the few funk/r&b/jazz bands to ever perform at a rock open air festival, the California Jam.  Their ablility to translate the power of their sound to the stage from the studio was truly amazing.  And their deep knowledge of music across genere's allowed them to be included in what many thought of as a \\"rock\\" only concert series like the California Jam.<br /><br />The 1st side of this double album is all live cuts from their various concerts in support of the classic, \\"That's the Way of the World\\" album.  However, it also includes songs from the \\"Open Our Eyes\\" and \\"Head To Sky\\" albums.  And one all new composition which, in my opinion, is the highlight of the live set, \\"New World Symphony\\".  This is a song that although it's an instrumental, it displays the genius of Earth, Wind and Fire with it's beautiful transitions and movements that are simply breath taking.  There are also great live cuts of smash hits like \\"Yearnin Learnin\\", \\"Devotion\\", \\"Reasons\\" & one of my personal favorites \\"Sun Goddess\\" a song that I believe is actually better live than the great recording they did with the legendary jazz artist, Ramsey Lewis.<br /><br />After all the glory you experience on the first side of the album, you are then treated to a second half of wonderfully written new songs recorded in studio while they were touring.  The band had 4 of their 9 members who wrote songs regularly with Maurice so they were very prolific and could bring a wide variety of styles to the table.<br /><br />\\"Sunshine\\" is a classic Earth, Wind and Fire song about love and inspiration with goregous lyrics and melodies, \\"Singasong\\" is a great tune co-written by Maurice and Al Mckay and is an FM radio favorite.  \\"Can't hide love\\" is the only song not written by one of the memebers of the band but a close friend, Skip Scarborough, and is one of Maurice's best arrangements with it's tight funky groove and almost haunting vocals harmonies.  But my 2 favorites are \\"Gratitude\\" a pure funk inspired jam with gospel undertones  & \\"Celebrate\\" a beautifully written song with a clear & concise message about the importance of the power of our thoughts in changing our own lives and affecting the world in a positive way.<br /><br />This is a wonderful album and is one that will just bring a smile to your face and make you happy!  And that, along with incredible innovation & musicianship, is the true legacy of the Elements of the Universe: Earth, Wind and Fire.ns and movements that are simply breath taking.

B002E2M5J6|4.0|No doubts Jamiroquai is one of the greatest shows to see, and fun to hear. that jazzy, funky music has an amazing groove.    I own the Live in Verona on DVD, but I was expecting for a blu-ray concert to come out, so i got this one.     The sound is very good, but from the minute i started waching it, i felt there was something missing. It may be the mood of the audience, jay not at his best, maybe the rain was missing. this one is missing the vibe you could feel watching the Verona concert. Kudos for the set list, and the groove of the bass is great. i'm still waiting for a live performance of the song \\"Just another story\\".    It is an excelent concert, you must have it if you like this guys, but, after watching this one, you will go back to Verona..
0307341569|5.0|This book is definitely on my list of the best books I've read all year.  Often a second book is like the second night of a play - you've peaked & you need to move on to see any changes & progress.  Other times, the second book builds on the promise of the first & exceeds it.  This is one of those times.<br /><br />I loved Sharp Objects for all of the ways it refused to knuckle under to the convenient stereotypes that all women are caring & never violent & that all children are angelic & innocent.  It was a gritty, compelling read & almost impossible to put down.<br /><br />Dark Places is just as gritty & compelling & perhaps more difficult to put down.  Once again this novel defies stereotypes, creating an event (the slaughter of most of a family) that is even more complicated underneath the surface than it appears at first glance.  Flynn relentlessly pursues the details of this event through the character of Libby, one of the only survivors.  As Libby explores the events of that night & investigates the possibility that her brother, in prison for the crime upon her testimony, just might be innocent.<br /><br />In a tale whose point of view is a moving target, all the circumstantial pieces of the puzzle are intricately wound together until the climax.  All of the characters are completely believable & all are flawed in one way or another.  These are people who are living in true poverty & it's not picturesque.  These are people who are struggling to put food in their bellies, to keep the heat on, to make it through one more day.  In the aftermath of the killing, Libby Day's subsequent struggles are understandable, poignant & heart wrenching, while Libby herself is all sharp corners & thrown elbows - walking out the door with your favorite lipstick in her pocket.  Flynn demonstrates the courage of her convictions through Libby, who is not ennobled by tragedy, but is not defeated by it either.<br /><br />The other voices in this novel are just as clear & just as complex & the story builds itself layer upon inexorable layer.  The last third of the novel will keep you up all night, make you late to work, late for dinner, make you ride past your bus stop.  &, best of all, the ending is completely credible & utterly satisfying.<br /><br />This is a dark & violent story that is filled with imagery that will stay with you long after you finish this book.  It's brilliant & terrifying & I can't wait for Ms. Flynn's next book.yer upon inexorable layer.

0440237688|5.0|We ordered this book for our son's english class.  We did not want to spend a lot of money for a book we knew would be read once and then put to the side, so we decided to order a used one.  I know that we ordered what was said to be a used book, but you cannot tell the book has ever been read.  The condition of the book was excellect.  Just like a brand new one hot off the press.  The book arrived in the time frame promised.  I would certainly use this seller again.
0143113100|3.0|The Brain that changes itself is about brain plasticity, or the brain's ability to adapt and change in the face of adversity...for the most part. The book has its flaws (see \\"the bad\\", and \\"the ugly\\") but the full range of damage and injury that is covered in this book makes it a must read. I believe that everyone will will encounter someone in their lifetime with at least one of these injuries and understanding what this book teaches will help us understand the situation and treatment options much more completely. Because of the flaws, I think this is a good read as long as you take the time to think about the text and draw connections between the chapters.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />Most of the chapters in this book are devoted to striking and impressive examples of brains overcoming damage caused from genetic learning disabilities, acquired injuries, cancer, and strokes.  Norman Doidge for the most part does an admirable job of showing how all sorts of diseases and injuries that were considered incurable are now curable with a variety of different treatment methods developed by a serious of very interesting and intelligent people.<br /><br />Also, to me, the most interesting section was in the appendix that explained about not only the plasticity of the brain but plasticity associated with culture and physical changes (and how that related to the brain), I would love to see a whole book on the subject.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />There is some serious problem with organization. For some reason, he throws the chapter \\"Acquiring Tastes and Loves\\" in the middle of the book. It is a chapter devoted to more subtle forms of brain plasticity and how it relates to love and fetishes...nothing to do with any of the exciting stuff like caner or any of that (I actually never finished the chapter because it interrupted the book so much). I think this chapter and a different chapter \\"Turning our ghosts into ancestors\\" belongs in a different section of the book that specifically relates brain plasticity to more normal psychological conditions and explains how psychotherapy can be beneficial in aiding these less radical changes (I am pretty sure that is the point he wants to make).<br /><br />Also, (A more personal peeve) I think he missed out on a great opportunity to talk about those few baffling people that appear to have virtually no brain just a bunch of cerebrospinal fluid in their skulls and yet lead reasonably normal lives. He could have speculated on the density of the brain cells or even the potential for other nerve cells to take over brain function. Or just left it as a medical marvel and indicated that there is yet more to learn about brain plasticity. (I am aware of the doubts regarding this info, but he could have easily addressed all the issues and opened our minds up to the possibilities of even more plastic change)<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />He is very opinionated and really loves some of these scientists paying them far more attention in the text than other equally impressive scientists. He does tend to take a more permissive view on animal experimentation, so if that bothers you, get the book from your library (I borrowed it from a friend), it's still worth reading for the information on techniques for overcoming disadvantages.<br /><br />There were several places where he made implied contradictions; they could be easy to miss since the contradicting sentences are at the beginning and the end of the book. Also, I think he missed out on some great places to tie things together for the reader and perhaps smooth over the contradictions.more normal psychological conditions and explains how psychotherapy can be beneficial in aiding these less radical changes (I am pretty sure that is the point he wants to make).

B000NVDMT2|5.0|I love this book for two reasons.  The content makes me go \\"aom - aom\\" and the condition of the book reminds me of my youth when I first read it.    I love this transaction for two reasons.  The bookseller followed up with a note reminding me of what I had ordered and that this definitely was not a book in crispy, new condition AND it came earlier than estimated.
0385504225|4.0|I really don't understand why people have been so hard on this latest book by Dan Brown.  I found the entire book very intriguing, and quite enlightening.  There were some predictable plot twists, but authors have a very hard time being successful in outsmarting the reader at every turn.  I believe it was very well written, and the thing I've always like about mystery/thrillers is the fact that the author usually does give you enough info to figure things out for yourself.     I've seen that many other folks have been upset by the ending, and I don't understand why.  The ending wasn't a huge enormous ending like the previous two Robert Langdon books; however, I believe it was much more relevant.  This ending reminded me of (may he rest in peace) Michael Crichton in that he gave you something very interesting to think on after finishing the book.  Is it so wrong for someone to ask you to expand your mind and look at things in a different way?    I would recommend this book for any person who enjoys a good story and has an open mind.
B002C6K7NA|4.0|Lynyrd Skynyrd is no longer the Ronnie-led band of the 70's. To truly listen to the new albums, one must understand this. Comparisons will be made of course, but the band has truly moved on, as any band that has lost most of its original members. The sound is much more similar to that of modern day southern rock: a heavy country sound, though certainly less sappy than most country out there today.     Overall I was impressed with this album, having come to not expect much from the band as of late. If you are starting out on Skynyrd, definitely start from the beginning, but if you're interested in the more recent stuff, give 'Still Unbroken' a try and if you like it, ge the rest. You'll enjoy this latest effort by the mighty Lynyrd Skynyrd.
B00275EHCI|3.0|The essential premise behind SURROGATES is interesting, although perhaps not entirely original.  It is the not-too-distant future, but 98% of the human population is living through a surrogate.  These robots do everything for you, AS you.  You can sit in the safety of your chair at home, getting fat and wearing pajamas all day, while your avatar, with a face (even gender) that you've chosen stands in for you.  You see and feel and hear everything...but there's no danger to you if you want to try something crazy.  You'll always look attractive and young.      Thus, in surrogates, no one is quite what they seem.  The 2% of people who refuse to join the \\"fun\\" live in ramshackle, electronics-free zones scattered around the country.  They live lives that resemble nothing more than hippie colonies...the fact that they not only rejected living through surrogates but apparently ALL forms of technology is never really explained.    They are led by \\"The Prophet\\" (original name!) who assures them the day of reckoning is coming.  And indeed, when a new weapon arrives on the scene...the new world order appears to be threatened.  This weapon allows its wielder to not only kill surrogates, but to also kill the human who is operating it.      There are many intriguing ideas and concepts (and questions) that this alternate world brings to mind...but SURROGATES is in the end more of a detective movie than a sci-fi movie.  And not a detective movie in BLADE RUNNER tradition (where the detective and his work is a way of delving ever deeper into what it means to live in this alternate society), but more in the I, ROBOT tradition of Will Smith kicking butt and taking names.  But with a lower budget.    SURROGATES has little in the way of truly new ideas, and apart from some randomly scattered amusing moments, doesn't milk much entertainment value from the pure idea of all of us sitting around, getting fat, lazy (and probably smelly) while our surrogates run around looking younger, fitter, sexier and smarter than we do...interacting with other surrogates who look hot but are in reality a stand-in for others who are fat, lazy and smelly.    To go along with lazy ideas are some lazy performances.  Rhada Mitchell plays one of the cops investigating this new weaponry, and it's as if she's taken the robot idea a bit too far...she fails to muster up any emotion, and thus, even though she is a \\"co-star,\\" she is utterly forgettable.  James Cromwell (as the inventor of surrogates) and Ving Rhames (as The Prophet) phone in their performances, giving us absolutely nothing we've not seen before in previous films.  Rosamund Pike has a small role as the wife of the lead investigator on the case, and she DOES at least show some sparks of emotion and generates a little empathy.    Thus, SURROGATES is at best a 2.5 star movie.  The effects are minimal, but generally convincing.  Action sequences (stage by Jonathan Mostow of TERMINATOR 3) are workmanlike but not actually bad.  Script is uninspired and the acting is uninteresting.    BUT WAIT.  I forgot to mention that the film stars Bruce Willis.  He is the master of elevating the quality of the film around him.  He can turn a very good film into a classic (DIE HARD, SIXTH SENSE) and he can turn a mediocre film into something at least enjoyable for its running time (16 BLOCKS, HOSTAGE).  And this is the service he performs for SURROGATES.  While he's not exactly a GREAT actor in the way we think of folks like Daniel Day Lewis or Robert DeNiro...he is a nearly perfect EVERYMAN.  No one does world-weary better.  In fact, world-weariness is what Willis always starts with, and then he just adds the right amount of smart-ass to the mix.  John McClane in DIE HARD...lots of smart-ass.  His character in TWELVE MONKEYS...only a tiny, tiny drop.  Yet he always knows exactly how much to add.  (Sometime his best efforts can only elevate a 1 star film to 2 stars...see STRIKING DISTANCE...or don't!  Also, this is a skill he's hones over time...some of his earlier work like MORTAL THOUGHTS or THE JACKAL pretty much just stinks.)    Willis is amusing in SURROGATES when he is seen as his surrogate.  Youngish, with a full head of very funny hair.  When the \\"real\\" Willis emerges, he's the Bruce we know.  Shaved head, scars and that patented world-weariness.  He also gets to show his other skill...the art of really looking like he's getting hurt, yet making us believe he can get up and keep fighting.  Again, John McClane is the archetype...but Willis still owns that trait.  Frankly, he's just a good guy to watch on film.  We like him...easily.  He's not the brightest tool in the shed sometimes, but he has good instincts, a quick wit and is usually a good person just trying to make the best of bad situations.    SURROGATES' script has saddled him with a sadness due to a son who has died years before...but Willis still makes his scenes with his wife (whom he so eagerly wants to wean off her surrogate so they can REALLY be together) touching.      Thus, thanks to Willis, the film is a solid 3.5 stars.  But for the overall lack of originality, I'll be treating that like 3.49 stars and rounding down to 3.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I was a little scared after being disappointed by Metallica's St. Anger.  I have been a huge fan of Alice in Chains since I was in high school.  When the new album was announced I was hoping it wouldn't ruin what Lane and Jerry created.  I assure you, this album is one of their best.  While I miss Lane's vocals, the new lead is rockin.  I have listened to this album at least 4 times since it came out yesterday and there is not one song on this album I didn't enjoy.  Highly recommended.
0385504225|5.0|I read most of the other reviews and I'm glad I don't put much stock into them. I loved the book! Good job, Dan Brown! I am a true fan. You always give me more to think about.

B0029LHW4U|2.0|Alice In Chains was my favorite band of the early 90s, but I'm realizing that I was a Layne Staley fan more than just an AIC fan.  I think that he added an unpredictable, soulful, and heartfelt stamp to the music.  Jerry is a technically gifted singer, but his voice sounds monotonous in large doses, much like Josh Homme of Queens...      The nasally, edgy, and powerful voice of Layne elevated the music to a higher place when coupled with the badass riffs of Facelift and Dirt.  At the same time, Layne could really pull back and use the dynamics of voice to sit perfectly within a song like \\"Nutshell\\".  Lyrically, I feel that Layne was just much more creative and heartfelt.  Can you really picture Layne writing or singing \\"Check My Brain\\"?  I can't, which is why this just doesn't feel like AIC to me.      I think this would have been a better Jerry solo record.  I appreciate him trying doing this in a respectful way because I remember all of the times that they couldn't tour because of Layne's drug addiction, so I'm happy to see Jerry kicking ass and playing the old songs live.  Will does a great job adding rhythm guitar, too.      This is a really good album, probably better than most other \\"rock\\" records that have come out in many years.  I just don't like the attempts by Jerry and Will to mimic Layne's timbre.  I'd rather hear more of Will's voice than Jerry's--again, refer back to the first paragraph...  If they're going to do an album without their original lead singer there, then I'd rather hear what the new singer can do.      Part of the reason I began to discard this band in the mid-90s was because I could see Layne faltering on their self-titled record and Jerry doing most of the heavy-lifting.  I wanted to like the ST album, but I didn't like Jerry hogging all the vocals--his voice and persona just isn't enough to carry AIC.  I think he's pulling the same thing here on this record, which is maybe why some people think it sounds the last AIC record.  I'm notready to give up on the band or this album, but I hope that Will can take over vocals with some authority should they do another record.  My favorite tracks are \\"A Looking In View\\" and \\"Acid Bubble,\\" but the rest just doesn't cut it for me.
B0007TKNII|5.0|The whole cast does an amazing job. I've already watched this several times. Great movie!
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|This is a great album, overall. I like to listen to whole albums at a time. This one had no songs that I have to skip.
0385504225|1.0|I cannot believe how much I hated this book.  Everything, and I mean everything, is explained, in detail, for us.  Every time the protagonist opens his mouth, it is to explain something else.  Unless one desires to join the Masons, or to understand The Magic Flute, there is no reason whatsoever to read this book.    I very much enjoyed 'Deception Point', which I think is an extremely well written and planned suspense novel.  Nothing in this book comes even close.  We spend almost 100 pages in the bowels of the capitol building, leading to nothing but another 20 pages of explanation of why a room looks the way it does.    Of coursem (spoiler alert), the fat girl dies, why else would she be in the book ?  This is not writing, this is typing, and, thank goodness, I got the book from the library instead of spending money on it.  A lazy writer, writing a lazy book.   Buy a dictionary instead, and read that.
0792162803|3.0|Molly Shannon developed the character of Mary Katherine Gallagher for Saturday Night Live! There isn't really enough material to expand the sketch to a full length movie, but they made a valiant effort. Hey, it worked for Wayne's World.<br /><br />Parts are funny, but like Mary Katherine Gallagher's auditions, a lot of parts just fall flat. Mary works as a video store rewind girl, and that provides her the opportunity to watch tons of films, classic and trashy. She memorizes parts and then says things like, \\"my feelings are best expressed by this dramatic monologue from ________ (insert classic yet incongruous movie title here).<br /><br />Will Ferrell plays a dual role, and is perhaps funnier in his second role. Tom Green doesn't have much to do, and frankly that is a blessing. Emmy Laybourne was great in a little bit as Helen Lewengrub, Mary's friend from Special Ed. At a boring assembly, they amuse themselves by playing Supermodel documentary hour. Though it was just an interlude that did nothing to advance the plot, it was nevertheless a most pleasant excursion.<br /><br />No need for a sequel, the material has already been stretched thin enough.

0385504225|1.0|After a great start the book really bogs down and becomes preachy.  Would anyone really care that some of our judges and politicians are Freemasons?  Most of them have done many worse things than participate in Freemason rituals.  Does Brown really think that someone who just lost an arm will run around DC?  With somone who has their blood draining out  of their body for a few hours?  Or with someone who \\"drowned\\"? The last 20-30 pages are not even necessary.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I have a feeling the few people writing negative reviews have not even listened to this album.This album ranks right up there with facelift and dirt.probably some of the best song writing and production to come out in a long time.It has the flow the feel, everything that aic was and is.And Laynes legacy still remains intact.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Once Layne passed away in 2002, most people felt that Alice In Chains was definitely no more. Then recently, there was the wild rumor that Alice In Chains was back with a new lead vocalist. Of course this ruffled a few feathers. Many felt that Alice In Chains was nothing without Layne.      Well...    As it turns out, Alice In Chains can still rock.  In a way, the band was definitely robbed when Layne passed, but one must understand that there were three other men that made up the band. Perhaps it is a bit more honorable and important that the band carry on with the new vocalist. DuVall is definitely a great vocalist. This album which (in my opinion) has nothing but good tracks on it definitely shows the band at their strongest (musically) since before the band's unfortunate demise which (thank goodness) turns out to have been a temporary thing. Layne was great of course and will never be forgotten. For he was the most recognizable face in the band, but what the other members have done is remarkable. This record is beautiful and I feel that Layne would definitely be more than fond of it.
B0029LHW4U|4.0|I don't feel comfortable writing this review. I feel like I'm at my 10-year High School reunion, and a girl I dated looks as hot as ever-except she's now missing a leg. Sure, we still make out, and it's not a bad experience, but...it feels a little...off. The attraction is still there, and I know her heart is true, but that prosthetic limb just creeps me OUT. I decide to drink and focus on the positives-she's in my life again when I never thought she would be, her eyes still sparkle like they did in Science class, and her words still make me feel.<br /><br />  I guess that's all you can really ask for in this life-something that makes you feel...<br /><br />...but being a leg man, I'm torn.<br /><br />  I miss you Layne...your brothers did good.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Upon listening to this album, I thought Layne Staley was somehow brought back to life again. Maybe someone will disagree, but I can't help but reminding of Layne when I hear the new vocalist William DuVall perform on this very welcomed return of Alice in Chains. Actually, the similarity is a good thing in my opinion.<br /><br />Not only the impressive vocal resemblance caught my attention. I was amazed to realize that the band's sonority was kept quite the same as fans were used to listen back in the 90s. Clearly, Jerry Cantrell and the guys did not forget who they are and what they used to do and delivered us with a piece of recording that provide us with a true journey back in time.<br /><br />\\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\", as said, contains the same raw, straight-forward sound that captivated hundreds of thousands of fans almost 20 years ago, when \\"[[ASIN:B00000272N Facelift]]\\" was put in the market. Although often associated with the grunge scene, Alice In Chains hardly fits into this category if we take a look back in time and revisit the other bands that emerged from Seattle at that time and were also labeled that way. Let the truth be told: Alice in Chains truly is rock band. And an excellent one.
B0029LHW4U|2.0|I was skeptical when I heard \\"Check My Brain\\" on the radio.  Sounded too commercial.    I was pumped when I heard the rest of the clips on Amazon.  Sounded edgy and awesome.    But now after listening to the cd twice, I'm really disappointed.  Something is missing.  Not just Layne Staley's voice, but his energy.  Each song has potential, but in the end falls flat and doesn't going anywhere interesting.  Lately, it takes me a few listens to get into a cd, but I'm pretty sure I won't be listening to this one much more.  And I'm a huge Alice in Chains fan.  But this isn't them.  Sorry folks.  Those who gave them 5 stars must be members of the band or their friends/family.    The best song, in my opinion, is \\"Take Her Out\\", followed by \\"Check My Brain\\".  The others are all pretty much lumped together in the category of \\"blah\\".    But, if I were to have heard the clips, and then read my review, I wouldn't have believed it.  The clips sound great...but the songs are just the clips repeated over and over.  You'll have to judge for yourself.    I hope it grows on me, and I can update this review with a better one.    UPDATE:  I listened to it 4 more times.  It has grown on me a little.  But still, just not a \\"great\\" album.  it's good.  i'll bump it from 2 to 3 stars (although it won't let me)
B002JTMNX2|5.0|It looks like music isn't bad business after all. In response to iTunes lead in the music market, other major retailers are reacting with different strategies, with Amazon selling digital downloads of new releases with 50% or more off the list price and with the brick-and-mortar stores (Walmart, Best Buy and Target) seeking for exclusivity contracts with artists and/or record labels. For obvious resons (bargain power and a huge network of stores available with significant traffic across the nation), Walmart has been able to catch the best deals out there by selling exclusively the new efforts by artists long acclaimed by both critics and the general public.<br /><br />For those unaware, \\"Can't Slow Down\\" - this new release by Foreigner - is a Walmart exclusive, both physically (a 2 CD + 1 DVD set) and digitally (with music from the 2 CDs only). Versions bought elsewhere might be imported editions or a simply resell of the product acquired in Walmart.<br /><br />As for the music, the new compositions sound just the way Foreigner ever sounded. Well crafted soft rock blended with mellow and mild lyrics, mostly about love and relationships. \\"Too Late\\", \\"Lonely\\" and \\"Angel Tonight\\" are three tracks that stand out from the other ones, which are also fine. Old time fans will not be disappointed.<br /><br />The greatest surprise, however, comes from the remixed tracks from past successes. While listening to the revisit opener, \\"Feels Like The First Time\\", I thought it was all about a remake at first, but as you pay attention to the details, fans can notice that some instruments sound exactly the same as per the originals. The remixing gave a whole new feel to these songs, but without wasting the talent spent when first recording it. The major motivations for anybody to pick a copy of this album surely are the new tracks and the DVD, but the \\"renewed greatest hits\\" section is a pleasant addition and, for some people like me, might be considered the best of the set.
B0025KVLUQ|4.0|Finally the Beatle's remasters are out, and this one is great.  I haven't owned a previous version of this album, so I can't compare to the older version(s).  But the remaster is a audio treat!  Crisp audio, clear vocals, a beautiful remaster.  My only complaint is that the included Mac application that plays the \\"making of\\" video is for PowerPC Macs only.  Intel Mac users will need Rosetta to run the app, or you can just find the video file in the data folder and run it via Quicktime player.
B0029LHW4U|3.0|As a Washington state native, I've been a loyal Alice In Chains fan since their very first album and own them all.  I've been looking forward to a new studio album from them for years but in particular after seeing them here in Seattle at the Paramount in 2007 with the new lead singer, William Duvall.    I have a high-quality headphone system which is very revealing and makes high-quality recordings sound terrific.  You can only imagine my disappointment when I first listened to this CD only to realize that it is one of the worst examples of The Loudness War!  Whoever mastered this did a horrific job that destroyed much of the effort the band made to create high-quality music for their fans.  If you don't know about The Loudness War, watch this video:  [...]  It sounds compressed, distorted with little musical impact.  Jerry Cantrell is one of rock's great guitarists and the mastering of this CD does not showcase that talent!  Listen to one of your older Alice In Chains CDs and you'll notice the superior dynamics and the riffs for which Jerry is so famous for doesn't sound like a bunch of congested noise.  If the record companies would only also release properly mastered 24/96 recordings for download I would GLADY pay a premium!    This is a great disservice to the band and most importantly the fans.  I want my money back ...
B0025KVLVA|5.0|I haven't bought much Beatles before, but Past Masters is a real treat!

If you are a fan of the Beatle's early songs, buy this album, you won't be disappointed!

(unless you go to BlueRay and HD tv of course)<br /><br />Can't believe they are giving a one year warranty on their lower cost line of products also!<br /><br />Amazon's new basic packaging is just great also, no frills, yet solid and right size for product.  These days, the web pages give you all the fancy stuff, no use in paying for it when it will not hang on a store rack to grab your attention.<br /><br />I'm sure to order more from this line in the future.

B001EO748M|3.0|Having 'cut my teeth' on the magnificent performance of Keith Michell, as Henry, it was difficult to relate to a dark haired, physically 'incongruent' Henry. That said, the portrayal of Anne was a highlight; She was cast well...Lusty, highly intelligent, manipulative and ultimately doomed by her inability to produce a male heir, one 'felt her betrayal' by the King and her judges...It is well acted on the whole, it portrays the time, accurately, and the characters were well cast....generally worth the price 'of the ticket'.....
B000E6ESL2|5.0|After seeing the protagonist Henry Lethan (Gosling) sitting beside a traumatic, fiery crash, the film collides into a patient and doctor relationship between Henry and his psychiatrist, Sam Foster (McGregor), sort of a creepy, foreboding version of the relationship between Robin Williams and Matt Damon in [[ASIN:0788814664 Good Will Hunting]] combined with a little [[ASIN:B00005B5WR The Sixth Sense]] flavor.  When Henry tells Sam about his suicidal plans to celebrate his 21st birthday in three days, Sam's attempts to save Henry lead to a mind-bending tale of regret, warped d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, and altered consciousness.<br /><br />Truly a visual masterpiece, [[ASIN:B000E6ESL2 Stay]] flows from one scene to another with creativity similar to interwoven scenes of a filmmaker's representation of an M.C. Escher painting.  Blending in a wave of colors and transitioning from one scene to another with some great jump cuts and interesting visual quirks, the cinematography is a surreal dream reminiscent of the originality and innovations in films like [[ASIN:B000P0J0AQ The Matrix]], [[ASIN:B00005JNTX Sin City]], and [[ASIN:B00009OLTN Spun]].  Put it this way, in one red hue saturated, hallucinogenic bar scene, I would swear the filmmakers purposely cast Dr. Ruth and Salvador Dali look-alikes as bar patrons just to make the scene more bizarre.  Every scene is an excuse to use color, lighting, shapes, angles, and various editing techniques to accentuate the storyline and express the artistic aspect of filmmaking.  It's brilliant.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the story and twist from The Sixth Sense, then Director Marc Foster's journey, his hybrid version of reality and illusion, is sure to please.  And despite some reviewer's displeasure with the ending, I think it's a wonderfully cerebral, thought provoking conclusion.<br /><br />Jason Elin

B0007Y08QA|3.0|You know those days where you are dog-tired, can barely get out of bed, and go into zombie mode up until your lunch break?  That's not tired.  When compared to Trevor Reznick (Bale), a man whose guilt and paranoia has caused multiple years of a schizophrenic insomnia, those exhausting days are child's play.<br /><br />Finding slight camaraderie from a factory co-worker, Miller (Michael Ironside), comfort in the bed of a hooker named Stevie (Leigh), and friendship from an airport waitress (Sanchez-Gijon), Reznick drags his emaciated skeleton throughout the day, almost embracing the starvation and insanity, ignoring his hunger and sleep deprivation.  When Miller loses an arm in a work-related accident - a direct result of Reznick's hallucination-filled negligence - the world begins to crumble amidst habitual post-it notes, the disposal of a dead body, and a mysterious game of hangman.<br /><br />Revealed through flashbacks and sleep distractions, the cause of Trevor's increasing alienation and withdrawal from reality receives a twist when he sees Ivan (John Sharian), a creepy colleague who nobody else can see.  Convinced he's being plotted against, Trevor grows crazier until the very end.  The clever blend of repressed memories and psychotic conceptions, it's [[ASIN:B00003CXZ4 Memento]] and [[ASIN:B0007DFJ0G Fight Club]] rolled into one.<br /><br />First and foremost, this is a vehicle for Christian Bale's dedication to character acting.  Literally destroying his own body, Bale looks like a concentration camp victim throughout the movie, and is completely believable as a person who hasn't slept in over a year.  A growing self-awareness and guilt oozes from Bale's pores, as he absolutely nails the role.  When a beautiful woman destroys her looks, she receives an award (Theron in [[ASIN:B00005JMUK Monster]]).  When a man goes much further, he's overlooked.  It's almost as disturbing as Bale's appearance in this film.<br /><br />I, like Reznick, just want to find peace within this movie.  On one hand I admire the dedication and bizarre storyline; conversely, however, there are several moments in which this movie drags.  With the eerie cinematography, music, and dedication involved, this is an original movie deserving of praise.  The only downfall is that it's a tad monotonous and boring at times, and the viewer ends up finding a slight insomnia cure from which Reznick suffers.<br /><br />Jason ElinI admire the dedication and bizarre storyline; conversely, however, there are several moments in which this movie drags.

0689835604|5.0|12 month old's favorite book.  It's the number 1 book she brings to us when she wants to be read to.  The pictures are bright and enjoyable for baby to look at.  Also, opening the flaps helps with hand eye coordination and seems fun for her.  The flaps could be a little more durable as she's ripped of the final flap so we always know where baby is.  I highly recommend this book!
1416562605|5.0|Balram Halwai, the son of a rickshaw-puller in India, is feisty and ambitious.  He succeeds in his quest to get a job as a rich man's chauffeur, and we know from the beginning that he kills his boss and becomes an entrepreneur.  This set me up to want to find out why he did it and how he got away with it.  Balram tells his story in the form of a (very long) letter to the premier of China who is coming to visit Balram's city of Bangalore, ostensibly to find out how to bring technology and entrepreneurship to China.  Balram begins by describing the paradox that is India--the high-tech outsourcing companies surrounded by slums with open sewers and contaminated drinking water.  Then he proceeds with the story of his life, including his father's death from TB at a public hospital with no doctor.  This sounds incredibly bleak, and it gets worse, but Balram's voice is laced with dark humor and sarcasm, and I found myself ashamed to be laughing.  I love that Balram justifies the murder of his boss by observing that we often honor our murderous leaders with statues.  The author seems to enjoy pointing up all the dichotomies that exist in India.  For example, graft and election fixing are rampant in a country that considers itself a democracy.  The rich are corrupt, while their poor servants are scrupulously honest to avoid the wrath of their masters.  Sadly, the book offers no hope that India will ever be able to dig itself out of this situation, and certainly the author is not suggesting that the country needs more Balrams.  The irony is that Balram escapes poverty by emulating the every-man-for-himself attitude of the men in power.

0375434526|3.0|I would like to start with the positive- I managed to read this book all the way to the end and even enjoy most of it. However.....    The impression I got is that Mr. Brown wanted to send a message of hope and peace to the world and chose his familiar, readers- attracting protagonist, Robert Langdon, to do so. This is the only thing that can explain the weak plot, the predictability, the sudden stupidity of Mr. Langdon, the not-even-remotely-shocking \\"shocking revelations\\" and the endless repetitions. In fact, practically half the book reads like a questionable encyclopedia/New-Age self-help book/ philosophical-theological manifesto rather than like a novel.     Although the trivia parts are what I liked about the DVC, Mr. Brown took it too far this time. Luckily, I did find the subject interesting which is what kept me reading but if you are looking for a fast-moving plot and a lot of action this is not the right book for you.

0451529308|1.0|Louisa May Alcott, Little Women (Signet, 1880)<br /><br />I figured attempting to struggle through this for five months (actually, five months and one week) was more than enough torture, and so I gave up about a quarter through the book (I ended on page 124 of 455). I can understand the many accolades the book has gotten from various writers (the afterward of the one I was reading, for example, was penned by Susan Straight) about the depiction of women, especially young women, as groundbreaking for its time. All well and good, but I couldn't get past the aggressive bucolic nature of the thing, which makes the Beany Malone novels seem as if they were written by Huysmans or Lautreamont (or Sartre or any other nihilist/existentialist you'd care to name). I have often wondered if there were a particular novel Melville were parodying in the hilarious opening pages of Pierre; it is obviously not Little Women, published some twenty-eight years after Pierre, but I can see where Melville was coming from anyway. (This was actually an accepted literary style of the time? How depressing.)<br /><br />You may ask what in the world I'm going on about (though I assume if you're a fan of the book you have an idea of what the word \\"bucolic\\" means without me having to explain it to you). It's this--no one in this book ever thinks a truly bad thought. No one could ever even consider doing a bad deed. These characters are squeaky clean. Have you ever, in your entire life, encountered a household with four female children (especially four female children being raised by two females, since dad's off to war) where there was no bickering? Ever? Where every small, unintentional slight was worked out by calm, rational debate? No. Of course not. Why? Because that household does not exist. It did not exist in 1880, and it does not exist in 2009. There are obviously those who can relegate that to the backs of their minds; I found it impossible. Thus, one more book fed to the dustbunnies in 2009. (zero)

I have a tendency to fall for characters in a book and if I'm not interested in the characters, than I'm not interested in the book. The way I judge a book is if I have an overwhelming need to stop what I'm doing and start reading because I'm so curious as to what's going to happen next. This book was like that for me.
B002KH4KSY|2.0|Children of the Corn (Donald P. Borchers, 2009)<br /><br />Fritz Kiersch first adapted Stephen King's chilling story \\"Children of the Corn\\" for the big screen in 1984. It, and its many, many sequels, have become staples on the Syfy Channel (and its recent spinoff Chiller) in the intervening years. By now, the original is a certified cult hit, despite the fact that as a movie, it really kinda blows. (Okay, remove the \\"kinda\\"; the only big-screen King adaptation that's sillier is \\"Graveyard Shift\\", and that's at least so over-the-top stupid it deserves some recognition.) So when Don Borchers, who wrote the screenplay for the underrated Grace Jones vampire flick Vamp, and King himself set out to make a new adaptation, they didn't have to raise the bar too high to make it better. Aside from a few screens, they did an admirable job.<br /><br />I don't know how it escaped me in all the years since I first read the short story (which happened, I think, in 1978) that \\"Children of the Corn\\" is a Vietnam War allegory. (You know, cornrows, thick foliage, jungle...) It makes sense, though, and Borchers and King bring that out a lot more in this adaptation. They also make a couple of other changes, some of which work, and some don't. In case you've never read the story (and by all means, you should do so at your earliest convenience), the plot: Vietnam vet Burt Stanton (Into the Blue 2's David Anders) and wife Vicki (Battlestar Galactica's Kandyse McClure) are on what's supposed to be a second honeymoon. Only it looks a lot more like it's going to wind up in divorce. Burt, sick of highway driving, got off the Interstate in Nebraska and decided to travel on back roads for a while. At one point during their bickering, a kid with his throat cut stumbles out onto the road, and Burt sees him too late. He decides he's going to drive to the nearest town and report the accident. Unfortunately, the nearest town is Gatlin, where, we learn in the opening scene (one of the big points against the movie; the best part of the story is finding all this out as we go along), a crazy kid had, twelve years earlier, incited the rest of the town's children to kill everyone over the age of nineteen, claiming God was speaking through him in the guise of something called He Who Walks Behind the Rows. (It's a bit more obvious in this movie, as well, who He Who Walks Behind the Rows really is... in case you didn't get the memo.) Since then, everyone is killed upon reaching their \\"Day of Favor\\" (nineteenth birthday), to keep up the sacrifices, keep the rain coming, etc., etc. Think of it as The Wicker Man, peewee-style. And needless to say, Burt and Vicki are over nineteen.<br /><br />There are all sorts of interesting, somewhat perverse quirks in this flick. Sometimes when King goes back and revises his old stories for film, the result is just horrendous (look at the \\"new ending\\" for The Mist, for example), but most of what's here works just fine. The connotations of Vicki being black (the film, by the way, stays true to King's original mid-seventies setting--though I swear the story was set in 1978, while this version of the film is set in 1975) have been hotly debated on the IMDB message boards since the film originally aired, and I don't really have anything to add that hasn't already been said save that this is the kind of change I expect screenwriters to overplay, and it's not done here. Similarly, Burt's Vietnam War background is integrated nicely, especially in the flashback scenes, which feel less derivative than they do iconic (one in particular will strike you as very familiar, and it works here). The one change that doesn't work I can't tell you about, because it would spoil the film's biggest Big Reveal. But man, I can't believe they spent so much of their special effects budget on it. (You'll know it when you see it.)<br /><br />On the other hand, what doesn't work in this movie, by and large, is the acting (or lack of same). Burt and Vicki are both played by capable actors (though McClure finds herself with a Judith O'Dea/Naomi Watts-style role, where most of the time she just has to scream), and Malachai, the town enforcer (Broken Bridges' Daniel Newman), has some acting chops. All the child actors, though, seem to have been chosen from headshots rather than acting ability. Most of those are small parts, so it's not a huge problem. Isaac the crazy preacher-kid is played by Dexter's Preston Bailey. You'd think someone who's been around for a couple of seasons of one of TV's highest-rated shows would have had some enunciation classes by now (and in many ways, Isaac is the film's actual main character). The other relatively large speaking role is that of Nahum, played by Paul Butler (of My Sister's Keeper); cute as a button, but not ready for speaking roles at this point in his career.<br /><br />Still, acting problems and dumb special effects aside, this towers over the 1984 adaptation. Which doesn't make it a good movie by any means, but if you're sitting around with nothing to do on a Saturday night and you choice is between this and, say, Spring Break Shark Attack, you should definitely go for this one. ** ½Clure finds herself with a Judith O'Dea/Naomi Watts-style role, where most of the time she just has to scream), and Malachai, the town enforcer (Broken Bridges' Daniel Newman), has some acting chops.

B000RZGIOA|4.0|After a rocky start with 'Hard Target', Woo's early American film career continued in an upward trajectory with the underrated 'Broken Arrow', before culminating in this film, a highly characteristic deconstruction of the American thriller. (One might argue that then a disconcerting falling-off began with 'Mission Impossible 2', but that's another matter.) Once again Woo uses Travolta to good effect, establishing him as a preferred actor only this time in a plot that is, to say the least, bizarre. 'Face/Off' - at least to those who carp about such things - is unrealistic, unconvincing and, frequently, just down right silly. In this film it seems, the 'willing suspension of disbelief' has to be suspended so high, and so frequently, that it is almost out of sight.  But criticisms circling around the questionable realism of the film are missing the point. Woo comes from a film-making tradition where 'common sense' and 'logic' (particularly in action/fantasy pictures) are not considered by viewers as important as they are to audiences here. Stunts and plot lines regularly defy what would be our natural expectations and logic, grounded as we are in the different Western, realist tradition. In his film Woo uses the distancing, and peculiar advantage, that this cultural difference brings, creating an ironic comment on the action film, as well as indulging his own thematic obsessions.  The 'face/off' procedure is simply a plot device, a MacGuffin (to borrow Hitchcock's term for a red herring) allowing Woo's exploration of these concerns. In this light, it's not important that the operation is plainly absurd, or that Cage and Travolta are obviously different body shapes. What matters is the play that this change thereafter allows the director on identity, moral values, audience expectation, acting styles - and all the rest.  As if the underline this, Woo has the actors make a unique, artificial 'face off' movement (down the face with their hands) when the magic words are spoken on screen, a visible mantra to the whole procedure. The implausibility is thereby *emphasised*, not hidden, a dramatic device made into a flourish, not a liability. Woo in short doesn't care about plausibility, because his true concerns lay elsewhere.  But the sniffing at Woo's substantial achievement continues. Yet no one criticises Franju's 'Les Yeux Sans Visage' - which is equally ridiculous in its central conceit - even though there we are supposed to take the operation seriously. Perhaps because this type of event is 'allowed' without raised eyebrows, in our regular horror tradition we wave it through. In Frankenheimer's 'Seconds', to take another example, Rock Hudson is miraculously (and to my mind absurdly) created out of a body of a shorter, middle aged man. 'Seconds' is a (good) film without a post-modern idea in its head - yet has won plaudits because of the wider social issues it addresses away from the unconvincing new identity-creation.  'Face/Off', in short, requires a more sophisticated response from some critics and action fans than it has so far received. A comparison with some of the less complex and more mindless action pictures that appeared at the same time (the overrated 'The Rock' for instance) reveals considerable strengths and virtues. Whereas other action films come and go, 'Face/Off' remains obstinately in the mind, teasing the genre, inviting repeated viewings.
B0012GMUZY|4.0|Good fast service. Crack on front of case on arrival. Otherwise, the CD was in perfect condition.
B001QXE0OC|1.0|The CD contains a data session before the audio. This means that your computer sees it as a data CD and you may not be able to play or even rip it properly. The flash launcher on the CD recommends to run \\"cdplayer.exe\\" This program last came out with Windows freaking Millennium! Just how far behind the times can these labels be? I mean, really, Windows Millennium?
B001AVCFK6|3.0|The story was awful - Gene R would have not let all the story inconsistencies happen, but the sound and special effects were good.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Not only is this album amust have, but for those of us in Sf that saw them live @ the Filmore live yesterday (9/28/2009) the day before this albums release well the songs on this album that were played live were so great live if you have the chance you'll love the show and the new songs live!!!
B002FRNCG0|2.0|Critical reviews are often slammed so let me start off by saying that you may absolutely love this CD, it all depends on what draws you to Paramore. Two things drew me to Paramore, one, and I'm sure we can all relate to this, was Hayley Williams' voice. The other, which I considered to be more important, was that they rocked quite a bit more then the typical \\"mainstream chick fronted pop punk\\" group and they were a lot more fun. It was quite a bit more believable than say, Avril Lavigne or Ashlee Simpson.    This CD is okay, it's not a catastrophe by any means and it's probably worth buying for anyone who liked \\"All We Know\\" and \\"Riot!\\" because the sound is intact. Having said that, this album is lacking. One thing about Paramore that's always bugged me is they only offer us 11 tracks at a time, which was okay before because they were all solid tracks. The problem here is inconsistency, and there's a lot of it. When Paramore tries to make slower ballads, let's face it, they usually are pretty bad. On this CD they try to do that way too much. I would say about half of the songs are slowed down considerably compared to \\"Riot!\\" and we all know why, even if we don't want to admit it. Twilight. That god awful vampire movie ruined Paramore for everyone, because the success of \\"Decoder\\" among young little teenyboppers made the band think that they had to slow things down to reach major success. Well, even if you liked Decoder, which I was never crazy about, the ballads here are barely inspired at all compared to that. I think the major issue is that Hayley (or whoever writes lyrics for this band) is way too cliched. Ballad + Cliched lyrics - anything worth mentioning instrumentally = terrible songs.    Now that that's out of the way, the faster more rock based songs are nothing short of Paramore's former glory. They make you happy, they make you want to get on your feet and move. I HOPE that they are the songs that the band chooses to play live because if they are then they could turn a mediocre album into a great concert experience. While the band behind Hayley manages to offer even less than they did last time (even with the addition of a second guitarist) in terms of hooks and bass fills, you can still find something to groove to on this CD. Last but not least, vocally, Hayley Williams is a power house once again. Her voice can make atheists believe in God and wake a brain dead coma patient up from his sleep.    So I'm not gonna say you'd be wasting your money buying this, everyone will be able to find something to enjoy here if they enjoyed the previous material of this band, there just may not be enough of it. If you're like me you could do what I should have done and sample the songs, download the good ones, and make yourself a pretty gnarly EP, one where Paramore is still able to rock your socks off like they did when they collaborated with Set Your Goals on \\"The Few That Remain.\\" Otherwise, if you liked Paramore in their early days and want something with that kind of passion I would recommend \\"Soho Lights\\" by Tat instead.
B002Q63JEU|4.0|I love Paramore both as a band and as people. I listened to \\"Let The Flames Begin\\" and \\"When it Rains\\" every day for probably about 8 months last year. Like all Paramore fans, I was anxious for this album and a little upset I had to wait 4 months to get it after they announced they'd finished recording. I've listened to it all the way through probably 20 times so far, and I gotta say it's good. However, I feel it's a step down from Riot!. All the songs are good, but none really stick out for me, and the songs aren't as destinct from one another as they were on Riot!. I actually think \\"Ignorance\\" is probbly the 5th best song on the album, so if you like that you should enjoy the rest.    Overall it's a good record that fans will enjoy. And Hayley, Jeremy, Taylor, Zac, and Josh, if you read this, know that I love you guys and it killed me to say anything negative your album, but I want to be as brutally honest as possible since I know a lot of fans will repeat each other saying they love it and give a 5 star rating. Hope everything is well with you guys and thanks for the music!
B002C6K7NA|5.0|\\"God and Guns\\"..... I bought the two disc special which contains six extra cuts. I see a lot of people referencing this album as more of a \\"country music\\" type album. I disagree. What people have to realize is that its not Skynyrd sounding \\"country\\" its current day country music sounding more and more like \\"Skynyrd\\".     This album has OUTSTANDING studio quality sound. The guitars scream loud and clear, Johnny VanZant does an awesome job delivering the message. The lyrics are strong and true. There is a little bit of something for everybody on this album. The Great \\"All American\\" Band. God Bless Lynyrd Skynyrd. The music proudly lives on.
0375842209|4.0|I had a really hard time getting into this story at first. It wasn't that it was a bad book, just a little slow. As it progressed, I started to enjoy it more. But, it never felt like that 4 or 5 star review that you so often see for this title. But, then I got to the last 100 pages or so. All of a sudden I couldn't put it down. It gripped me until the end. I even cried. All of a sudden a book that was close to being a 3 maybe 3.5 star book became a 4. I'd like to give it more, but the beginning brings it down. The end was completely worth the 400 or so pages it took to get there.
B000OVLNII|5.0|I give it five stars because I got exactly what I expected from the description of the book by the seller. I like that. When you get what you expect I believe that is worth 5 stars. My expectations are always high.

B002FOQXZK|5.0|Listening to this album brings me back to some of the older hip hop that made me fall in love with the genre, Cudi speaks from the heart in his songs, not hiding his emotions, it really made me feel like he was speaking to me personally. There are a few songs but for the most part you can tell cudi put his soul into this album.     He's still young, new to the industry and hungry I hope he never loses himself in the business and pumps out meaningless lyrics like every other artist in the industry such as Jay-z or lil Wayne.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|Orphan is the perfect thriller in this day and age when movies seem to lack alot of substance.  I went to see Orphan after a friend told me it was a great film and had a great story and a great twist in the end.    I have to say it has been awhile since I had been on the edge of my seat and this one did a good job at it.  I give this movie 5 stars because even though it is advertised as a horror movie, it's really a strong thriller and a good suspense drama rolled into one.      See for yourself and buy Orphan on DVD October 27th!!
B001TH7GT6|5.0|Six feet of strong, durable video cable from my [[ASIN:B0000B3E8U Sony RCDW500C Compact Disc Player / Recorder]]to my [[ASIN:B0018C7FSO Mitsubishi LT-46149 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV with Integrated Sound Projector]] is perfect.  Amazon's brand is top-of-the-line for quality.  The cable ends are designed to be grasped firmly and the inputs are tight and secure without being TOO tight (as in unable to unplug them without damage).  The colors make it easy to get the connections right.  If you read the description, it has minimal signal interference (none that I could see or hear), are corrosion resistant and most importantly, has gold-plated connectors.  This is important as gold is the best metal for carrying signals (also one of the reasons the best sounding CD's are sometimes remastered in Ultradisc II Gold, i.e. [[ASIN:B000000IVE Trafalgar]]).  Plus, for less than $10, this is an investment in your sound system.  (Has a warranty too, which you'll  never need).
0061339202|1.0|This book is near impossible to read.  It has:  - bad flow  - is hard to follow  - is sporadic hence unable to hold attention and   - doesn't make any points very clear at all.      Throughout the entire book it seems to simply \\"state\\" things, theories, without adding much value or making the theories very practical at all.  The book just prattles on and on about \\"things\\".  It's a book of statements!      Ironically, you really only need to read 1 page of this book - the page with the \\"Flow\\" diagram summed up the whole book. I can summarise it like this: \\"To be in flow, ensure your skill level and challenge level go up in tandem\\". That's it!    This is the problem with academic journals trying to \\"cross-over\\" into popular business bestseller territory.  It's padded out to fill a book when it doesn't need to.  It still reads like an academic journal i.e. not for public consumption, so shouldn't be sold as such.  Perhaps it would be a more effective book with just 1/4 of the pages? Admittedly, it's not easy for any researcher to turn their academic works into a \\"cross-over\\" sensation as a popular business bestseller.  Successful books that come to mind are \\"In Search of Excellence\\" and \\"Built to Last\\" / \\"Good to Great\\".    FLOW could've been a better book, but as it stands, it is of too little practical value to be a good read.
B0000691TJ|5.0|Ramones were always my favorite punk band growing up. The first 3 are classic albums from ICONS ...songs are fast, ugly and  timeless.. still stand up.  They had a few soft albums in the 80's , but \\"TOO TOUGH TO DIE\\" is old school.  Main attraction in a freak side show!! Joey Ramone shouts out loud and still angry. Guitar riffs and prodctuion are great and DEE DEE sings some serious Punk Rock anthems.  Had this one vinyl and love he reissue w/ killer BONUS tracks to enjoy.
B002HNA95E|4.0|Madonna has given us her third greatest hits compilation, this one promises to be the most comprehensive of her career, and it certainly delivers!  This is a huge collection of some of Madonna's best songs, and even the casual Madonna fan has to admit it's simply irresistable.  I've read through some of the other reviews on here, and I'm shocked at the amount of people giving it a low score because it includes previously released versions of most songs.  Being a career-long retrospective, I'd be offended if it included nothing but remixes or versions that differ from the classic songs we all know (and this album's lesser moments are just that).  So for me at least, this album gets it right on the grand majority of the tracks.<br /><br />With few exceptions, the remastering done is perfect!  I've never heard some of these songs sound so good.  \\"Vogue\\" sounds perfect.  \\"Frozen\\" has been cleaned up and freed of the muddled sound that plagued the Ray of Light album, and now sounds deep and vibrant.  \\"Hung Up\\" and \\"Sorry\\" have deep bass and crisp highs, and are presented in a non-blended format.  Also, we've FINALLY been given the single edit of \\"Into The Groove\\", also brilliantly remastered, and it's far superior to the versions you've heard on The Immaculate Collection and You Can Dance.  The album version of \\"Like a Prayer\\" is also included and remastered, and it's refreshing that for once we get the song in its beautiful original state instead of an awkward remix (a la Immaculate Collection).  Also included are two new tracks, \\"Celebration\\" and \\"Revolver\\", which do sound oddly out-of-place here but are still welcome.<br /><br />Now, the exceptions.  While most of the album sounds incredible, some of it is done so badly that you have to wonder why it was released at all.  \\"Music\\" has some issues with the sound quality.  For some reason, it's plagued with clicks and pops throughout the sound, and it's only that much more obvious when listening through headphones.  \\"Express Yourself\\" has been remixed again, and it's done in a very unprofessional and sloppy manner.  It attempts to be a combination of the video version and the Immaculate Collection remix, but it sounds rushed and pieced-together haphazardly.  The ending of the song is so unbalanced and sloppy it kinda slaps you in the face!  The version of \\"Erotica\\" here is the same as the GHV2 mix, only they tried to replicate it from scratch instead of just using the track from the GHV2 disc.  During 3:26/3:27, the person behind the controls slipped up quite obviously and cut the song too late, resulting in an awkward skip as the song moves on to the next bar.  It's easily the album's most offensive moment.  \\"4 Minutes\\" has been shortened to just over three minutes in length, and placed between \\"Vogue\\" and \\"Holiday\\", which makes it sound awkwardly short.  You'll hardly notice that it's there at all.  \\"Revolver\\" seems to be mastered in a lower volume than the rest of the album and has questionable sound quality as well (which is too bad...it's actually a really good song).  Most of these faults will go unnoticed by the casual listener, but Madonna fans will be outraged, and rightly so.  I know I was.<br /><br />Despite its faults, I can't help but consider this the ultimate Madonna collection.  Sure, it misses some songs, but it is impossible to squeeze Madonna's 70+ singles onto two discs.  It is the best of the best, and listening to it I can't pick any song that I'd replace with another.  This collection is a true Celebration of the Queen of Pop, and it should not be missed by any music lover.as been remixed again, and it's done in a very unprofessional and sloppy manner.

0385341008|5.0|This book has everything that a Reading Group would desire.  The epistolary style of the book enables the reader to reach the spirit and soul of the characters.  It is historical and yet has humour depth and pathos.  I found it hard to put down and can't wait for our Literary Circle to discuss it on October 15.  It is a book that I shall eagerly recommend to casual readers as well as my bookloving friends.<br /><br />Yvonne Parr

B00005JMJG|5.0|This is one of my favorite love stories of all time and to my mind one of the 10 best films of the last 20 years. Be forewarned.  It has a quirky premise and characters.  The heroine, Clementine, played by Kate Winslett, is on the outs with her lover, Joel, played by Jim Carrey. She impulsively decides to try out a new procedure which deletes unwanted memories.  She has the memory of her relationship with Joel erased.  When Joel finds out, he decides to have his memories of her erased.  Most of the movie concerns the night of this erasure, when the unconcious Joel fights desperately to maintain the memory of his lost love.  For such an outlandish premise, the movie seems very realistic to me.  It poignantly portrays how constant love is and how we cherish our memories of even failed relationships.  I don't want to say much more because I don't want to ruin the ending for anyone but, suffice it to say, that this film wonderfully portrays the complexity and permanance of love.   It also calls to mind for me the French quotation, which loosely translated says that \\"the heart has its reasons which reason cannot understand\\".  One final word to those of you who are not fans of Jim Carey.  I am not a great fan of Jim Carrey in his comic roles.  The Jim Carrey in this movie seems to be another actor altogether.  More that anything else,he seemed like an ordinary guy with a broken heart.  Highly recommended.
B0009JJMFQ|4.0|SIKU vehicles have proven to be the best choice in our household.  They are more realistic and sturdier than the many many other types we have.  My son, who is 6, was frustrated at first by the fact that the loader would fall easily off of this flatbed.  It took us some playing around to figure out how to keep it on (most of the time), so I wanted to share this tip:  - keep the scoop on the loader in its down position  - drive the loader to the front of the lowest portion of the flatbed  - close the ramp behind the loader until it CLICKS into position    Now you can drive reasonable fast and take some turns without the loader falling off.  I do wish they'd made a way to latch it on there for even more security...then it would get 5 stars!
0385504225|2.0|Dan Brown's latest novel is indeed fast paced and entertaining...if you can ignore the predictability, formulatic writing, and factual inaccuracies.  I was disappointed that the \\"secrets\\" were so obvious that I was able to figure out the identity and motives of the antagonist as well as the hiding place of the \\"super-secret symbol\\" hundreds of pages before the big plot twists were revealed.      Furthermore, if Dan Brown wants to make gee-whiz statements about the similarities of the Temple in Jerusalem and the human brain, he should check out an anatomy textbook (or even Wikipedia for crying out loud!) before he writes dopey statements like \\"Have you ever seen an acutal human brain?  It's built in two parts-an outer part called the dura mater and an inner part called the pia mater...\\"  Ummm...noooo. This describes the meninges, which cover the brain, not the brain itself.  As someone who has studied anatomy (and has in fact seen many actual brains), this was a particularly cringe-worthy statement.    There were plenty of other items in the book that forced me to suspend my disbelief.  For example: a character, after being seriously maimed, seems to just shrug it off as just \\"mortal flesh\\", and then proceeds to go on a walking tour of Washington rather than going to a hospital.  (Does that remind anyone else of the knight in Monty Python's holy grail who insists \\"It's only a flesh wound!\\"  after getting his limbs hacked off?)     Finally, I just don't get why any of the \\"secrets\\" needed to be so secret in the first place.  The big catastrophic thing that was to happen if the big tattooed bad guy got his way didn't seem like much of a catastrophe to me, either.     All in all, it is perhaps something to keep you entertained if you are stuck at an airport, or home sick with the swine flu (like I was..cough cough), but definitely forgettable.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I really missed Alice in Chains & understood why they felt it was unecessary to carry on. Nowadays, I always expect the worse from any band that trys to make a return especially one that are returning not only as one of the greatest alternative/grunge rock bands of all time but also one that returns from such a great tragedy. What a great album! I know they busted their asses to get this record out & it definitely proves that there's nothing that can stop them. There is no new bands that I can even raise my brow to & the reason why is because of bands such as Alice in Chains that continue to raise the bar each & every time. This is what rock is, was, & what should be. Congratulations Alice in Chains & welcome William Duvall..........    P.S. There's a track that features Elton John.
014017821X|5.0|\\"The Bloody Chamber\\" is a collection of stories exploring traditional tales where the woman comes out the worse, or is stripped of agency. Carter places the (usually female) protagonists at the center of the decisions and power that move the action or resolve the story.<br /><br />The title story is a re-imagining of Bluebeard in which the young bride is a fully fleshed character rather than a cipher, and female family connections prove crucial. Puss In Boots (which is wonderfully witty and bawdy) positions the female love interest as a co-conspirator rather than an object. The Lady Of The House Of Love presents a vampire queen with consciousness and horror for her situation, neatly skewering the \\"predatory sexual woman\\" theme of more traditional vampire stories. An inside-out Red Riding Hood reveals a virgin who is no morsel ripe for the plucking.<br /><br />The writing evokes texture and scent with lush descriptions of soil, skin, blood, even dust in the air. It's infused throughout with sensual themes -- this is a universe in which women have sexual appetites and lust is no more a sin than any other hunger. It leans toward the dark, which I liked because traditional fairy tales have always also been dark and often grisly.<br /><br />Read it on a night in with wind howling around the house, in a scented bath with candles and incense, or in an apple orchard golden with the smell of fruit and grass in the sun. And take your time.
B002BIULQ2|5.0|This is a very good movie.  I was a bit hesitant to watch it but my husband loved it, so I agreed and I was glad I did.
0307408833|3.0|Granted I've only made one recipe so far from this book, (Apple Cinnamon Muffins) they were a hit with my hubbie and the coworkers. I didn't tell them that there wasn't any sugar, eggs, milk or butter in them. They came out moist, delicious and fluffy.     I would agree with all the reviewers when it comes to the cost of ingredients and the added steps. There is one recipe that asks you to bake the vanilla cupcakes to make the \\"crumb\\" base. That requires me to bake 2 items? It's already hard enough to bake GF! Let alone the costs. I hope that Erin makes an addendum to this book and gives us the REAL recipes that she uses...but then again the reason why she doesn't is probably she'd go out of business if we knew all of her secrets, so these may be slight modifications for a book.. Humph that goes to show that you really need to be honest and upfront with your customers. I have yet to try the actual cupcakes at the bakery, so we will see when I head out to NYC.
B000O75F7C|5.0|What else can I say that wasn't said before on the comments -- a simply fantastic album with lush soundscapes and musical genius.  I love it!
B0021L8UPS|4.0|I originally skipped this movie because a) the trailer made it look AWFUL, b) killer kid movies are usually pretty tame and lame and c) the last Vera Farmiga killer kid movie I saw, which was indeed Joshua, sucked. Usually the kids never really do anything that awful... you know, push a few people into traffic here, knock someone out of a treehouse there... kid stuff. Not so Orphan! The blood starts flowing early, and doesn't let up! So let's get down yeah baby let's get down!    We begin in blur-o-vision with Vera as Kate being wheeled into a hospital to have a baby. She starts bleeding profusely. The nurse says sorry, the baby's dead as a rock, but Kate says no, I can feel it kicking, then they present her with a nasty bloody infant--and she wakes! Actually you could totally tell it was a dream from all the blurriness and surreality. She's having issues because her last pregnancy was a stillbirth, which might have something to do with her former alcoholism, and the fact that she's going to start shopping for replacement kids that weekend, because she feels like she needs to because the stillbirth let down her husband, John.    Actually this family is a hotbed of issues. They have a young daughter, Max, who is deaf because of something involving the pond out back of their de rigueur fabulous home, which is Kate's fault because she was hitting the booze when she should have been minding the kids. There are other issues, which get doled out later, but I'll just dump it all now. Her husband, John, had affairs back when. Anything else? Seems like there's more... Anyway, Kate obviously still has some serious issues, because she nearly has a car accident with little Max in the car. I read a review that said it's better when evil kids are placed in good families, but here it's important that Kate be a mess with a poor history of child care so it will make it plausible later that SHE is having issues and the new adoptee they get is an innocent cherub.    The movie is a little worried that its audience won't be able to sustain their attention, so there are a few absolutely pointless jump scares up front. Does ANYONE enjoy these? Join me in starting a petition to ban the inclusion of pointless jump scares in modern crap horror. Together, we can move mountains.    So they go to the orphanage where they barely look at the other girls before they meet creepy Esther upstairs painting eerily accomplished pictures. If you know the twist of the movie, which I knew going in, a lot of the stuff up here makes sense later. Her picture is about a mommy lion who lost her kids, but turns out they were alive and she found them--so there's some thematic resonance with Kate and John. They're both charmed by her maturity and poise, and decide to wrap her up and take her home. Sister Abigail, the kindly nun at the orphanage, tells them she came from Russia [listen for her on-again off-again accent] and that the family that brought her over died in a fire. She also tells them that Esther never gives them any trouble--except when they try to remove the ribbons that she wears around her neck and wrists. John and Kate think it's just a Russian thing, and there's no more about it. If you're familiar with the classic ghost story \\"The Velvet Ribbon,\\" you know there's something going on under there, but, well, I guess John and Kate aren't up on their classic ghost stories.    So they bring her home, where Max takes an immediate shine to her, but she's not liked by their older son, Daniel. Also present is Grandma Barbara, John's mother, who has quite a few sharp insinuations to make about Kate's mothering skills. I took one look at her and thought \\"Well, guess who's fated to die?\\" But of course I can't reveal what actually transpires. I need to also mention at some point that Kate has really annoying hair, and it stays annoying throughout the whole movie.    Now there's just a bunch of development stuff. There's a snotty future-victim girl at school that makes fun of Esther. Kate shows Esther a rose bush where she put the ashes of her stillborn daughter, and \\"as long as it keeps growing\\" she'll know the girl is in heaven or whatever. Obviously that bush is another future victim! Esther has a bizarre thick Russian bible she keeps hidden, but wussy Kate, who is afraid to set boundaries, doesn't look at it. There's a hot divorcee in town putting the moves on John. Then there's a funny sequence in which the snotty girl from school walks around this wooden playset while all these horror music cues play. It's the most terrifying playground equipment in movie history! Esther shows up out of nowhere and shoves her, but unfortunately the girl lives. Snore. Luckily Esther is about to up the savagery big time.    SPOILERS > > >  So then Sister Abigail comes to call, saying they have to do a factory recall on Esther. The little monster overhears and enlists Max, who is her little confidante, to break into John's safe, where she finds a gun! She holds the gun to little six-year-old Max's head--whoa!--then grabs a hammer and they head out by the snowy bridge. This is all in the dead of winter, by the way. As Abigail is driving away, Esther shoves Max into her way, she swerves, wrecks the car, and gets out to blubber over her, at which point Esther bludgeons her with the hammer! Innocent Max is all weepy, when Esther says \\"Stop crying! Grab a foot and help me get her off the road!\\" They do, and since she's still moaning, Esther repeatedly bashes her skull in, getting all bloody in the process. This is no tame kinda-mean kid movie! Esther implies all sorts of badness that might happen to Max and or mommy and daddy if Max tells. Soon she's holding a box cutter to Daniel's throat and extorting his silence as well. We also see that Esther's paintings have whole layers of violent content that only appears under black light--neat trick!    By now Kate is starting to have her suspicions, but John is telling her that she's nuts and has always been a psycho with serious issues anyway. Esther has been sweetening up to daddy big time, and when he tells her Kate might love it if she did something nice for her, Esther brings her flowers--remember the rose bush we knew wasn't long for this world? Kate freaks and jerks Esther around by the arm, but John defends the little girl. Then Esther goes into the workroom, and breaks her own arm in the vice! This girl is hardcore. She tells daddy, and he tells Kate to sleep downstairs.    Kate high-tails it to the liquor store, and while I don't mean to be callous about alcoholism, it's always a blast in movies when recovering alcoholics give up and hit the booze! Kate brings the booze back home [uh, IDIOT?] and pours one bottle out without opening the other. Then Esther puts the car in neutral with Max in it, making it look like Kate is endangering the kids again, and when she gets back home, Esther has of course pointed out the empty wine bottle. John tells her if she's not in rehab within a week, he's leaving and taking the kids. You in the audience are sitting there thinking \\"He is going to owe her the world's biggest apology...\\"    By this time it's full-on war between Kate and Esther, although Kate is still being a wuss and won't go full-on with it. For example, WHY does the idiot do her research into Esther's background while right there in the house with Esther and the snotty grandmother? They HAVE internet cafes, you know. You can get wireless at any Starbucks. Anyway, while this is going on, Daniel is out trying to get the evidence of Abigail's death out of the treehouse, when Esther locks him in there and sets it on fire. He ends up falling and having to be taken to the hospital, where Esther loses no time in trying to finally off him for good. This is partly the fault of smug moron grandma, who I can now reveal lives to the end, although if there was anyone I wanted to die... Anyway, Kate freaks and attacks Esther, and now KATE is stuck in the hospital. Geeze, and RIGHT when that crucial call comes in from the mysterious Russian orphanage with the answers to Esther's past! Sure hope Kate checks her voice mail in timely fashion.    Well, now it's John that's hitting the booze and cigarettes. Esther comes downstairs in a sexy black dress and makeup, and puts the moves on dad. He suddenly has a big breakdown, which kind of comes out of the blue since he seemed at best slightly irritated by the whole situation, but finally tells her no. Meanwhile, at his hospital, Kate finally gets that important call! And the secret twist is...    MEGA-SPOILERS! ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO KNOW? > > >  It's no Russian orphanage--it's an Estonian mental institution! And guess what? Esther is no nine-year-old. She has a chromosomal imbalance and is actually 33 YEARS OLD! She moves into families, splits the mom and dad up, and tries to seduce the dad. When he refuses, she kills them all!    This, of course, happens during a driving snowstorm. Now, there's no way I'm going to spoil the awesome ending for you, as it's just too wild, but I will make a few observations. First, Kate becomes a serious offender of distracted driving. John finds some secret paintings of him and Esther doing the hokey-pokey, but you'll notice that in then Esther is full-sized, because there is NO WAY any movie is going to show, you know, THAT. Next, I don't know how I might react in such a situation, but if I were to find a bloody corpse in my house with the murderer still at large on the premises, I doubt I would waste precious survival time blubbering over the corpse. Maybe I'm just cold. We again learn that if the psychopathic murderer is just knocked down and unconscious, do not leave them alone until you have put a bullet in their head! And finally, looks like Kate's never gonna get that apology...    Before we get out of the spoilers, I want to point out that the reason most killer kid movies are so lame is precisely that the evil ones ARE kids, and as such can't really be too bad without peeving parent's associations and outraging religious groups. Therefore, the whole reason Esther CAN be so bad is precisely that she's NOT a kid. Which is part of what makes this movie so uncomfortable for so long--you can't BELIEVE this kid is pushing six-year-olds into traffic and bludgeoning old nuns, and it definitely takes you out of the comfort zone... which is part of why I believe this movie is considered \\"bad.\\" But we'll pick this up after we invite the non-spoiler folks back in.  < < < SPOILERS END    In retrospect, I wouldn't say this movie is really that \\"bad,\\" I would just say that it is so discomfiting for so long--she's just a KID!--that it makes you feel a little funny. And then, this twist is SUCH a leap--although a fairly ingenious one, I think--that it maybe jars the audience a little too much. And it comes a little late in the movie, too, for such a big re-arrangement of everything you thought you understood. And as you know, when people are uncomfortable and don't understand a movie, they usually decide that it's bad. Why, even look at me: I started this review thinking this was a bad movie in the vein of Knowing, but now, after a little processing [and a day's time] I kind of think it's pretty clever.    Which is not to say it's not still a hoot. The movie has a fair amount of setup--most of which is relevant, so I don't begrudge the two hour-plus running time. I was snickering throughout, and the whole thing is a great deal of evil fun. Furthermore, it seems to know it, and has tongue planted in cheek. Nevertheless, I think one would be better prepared if one didn't go in expecting a GOOD movie.    Anyway, yeah, tons of fun! Yay, Orphan! Yay, killer kids! Go in expecting a big silly potboiler and Esther'll show you a good time.
B002GZQY6Q|4.0|I am a huge PT fan - from the early soundscapes to the later more progressive rock style.  Abolutely love In Absentia, enthralled with Deadwing and then even higher praise for Fear of A Blank Planet.  Seen them many times in concert and would have to say that, since first discovering PT in 2004, they rapidly rose to become my favorite band, surpassing Pink Floyd and Genesis.  Accordingly, I waited with great anticipation for The Incident and read all the glowing reviews about the 55 minute musical masterpiece.  My first tinge of concern came with the release of the single for Time Flies.  I found it, much to my surprise, repetitive and boring.  Repetitive is fine if there are subtle layerings and changes that take it in a direction.  Boring is not.  I finally got the album and quickly put it on for a listen.  All of the earlier albums grabbed me instantly and transported me to my happy place.  This one did not.  True, the album version of Time Flies is better than the single and there are some bright moments but it is a let down after the prior 4 albums where each one was better than the last.  I have listened to both discs many times and while I like it, I think if I was not already a big PT fan, this album would not convince me to get the others.  Seeing it in concert in Philadelphia last week did not change my opinion (the weakest concert from PT in the last 5 years). If you are new to PT, start with Deadwing or Fear of a Blank Planet instead.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I finally decided to sit down and watch this today.<br />When I saw Nathan, Neil, and Felicia perform at the Emmy's, I knew I'd want to check into this.<br />I'm glad I did!  It was incredibly good.<br />It has both humor and serious parts, jokes and drama.<br />The characters are interesting, you care about them (at least I did).<br />Everyone who worked on this did an amazing job, and I sure hope they're proud.<br /><br />Bottom line:  This is amazing.  Watch it!
B00022TPT8|5.0|This may be my favorite Sabbath album. While I also love Paranoid and Sabbath's first album, This album is even MORE mature, ever tighter, and shows Iommi and Ozzy at their absolute peak. I think this album is completely awesome. The slow songs are better, the playing and songwriting are MUCH tighter and more accomplished, and the dynamics of each song are also improved. This is Sabbath finally maturing and hitting their true stride.    Still, this album didn't sell nearly as well as Paranoid, and I know why: There is no easy entry point. The title track on Paranoid, though perhaps a throwaway track, is at least easily short enough to play on the radio, meaning you listem then buy the album and discover just how awesome the rest of the album is. That's not the case here. Although this album as whole is even better, more mature and more dynamic all around, there is no innocuous song to hook the uninitiated. You almost have to be a Sabbath fan already to buy this album, or it will turn you off. Not only are the good songs all too long to play on pop radio, they are also full of lyrics that can offend you if you decide to listen to them. Talking about smoking dope, religious intolerance, societal revolution, Satan, and fleeing a doomed Earth by blasting off into space-and taking more than 5 minutes to do it each time-is not a surefire recipe to get on the radio and grow your fan base.     Still, once you accept the fact that doom, gloom and a world gone mad is what Sabbath is about, you can appreciate the songs for what they are. Take a listen and you will see what I mean; every song is strong-even the instrumentals are well done. The obvious standouts, \\"Sweet Leaf\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\" and \\"Into the Void\\" are all ferocious rockers that outdo even the vaunted \\"Iron Man\\" in sheer musical impact. I'm not kidding. \\"Into the Void\\", in particular, is my favorite Sabbath track ever.
B001GCUO16|5.0|despite all the character issues, this movie rocks... I'm not a lightweight when it comes to film, so take that in to consideration.<br /><br />If you can ignore all the complaints and just enjoy the film, you won't be disappointed....<br /><br />it's a quality movie that has top notch acting and is filmed well... the fx are very good and it's very polished as a film..<br /><br />5 stars!
B000002LLC|5.0|In 1990, Madonna had released her sixth album entitled, I'M BREATHLESS. This album, not a soundtrack to the film, \\"Dick Tracy\\", but contains music from and inspired the film, is simply great. It most certainly does not disappoint.    HE'S A MAN   A great way to start off this \\"Dick Tracy\\" inspired album. If you listen closely to the very start of the song, you'll a clip from the film, \\"Dick Tracy\\"    SOONER OR LATER   This song was performed by Madonna twice in the film. She performs an unplugged version (not this version) in the beginning before \\"Big Boy Caprice\\" (played by Al Pacino in his most annoying role yet) captures Lips Manlus. The second time she performs this song (this version) is when \\"Big Boy Caprice\\" has his grand opening at Lips Manlus' club, after taking over the club. Great jazzy song. Even my father likes this one.     HANKY PANKY   The album's second & final single. Without a music video to support it, this song hit the #10 spot (Billboard Hot 100). I had the pleasure of seeing Madonna perform this classic on RE-INVENTION TOUR in 2004, and she did an awesome job of it.     I'M GOING BANANAS   Love this tune.    CRY BABY   Not bad.     SOMETHING TO REMEMBER   A beautifully performed ballad. Expect to see this tune to pop as the title track to Madonna's 1995 greatest ballads album entitled, SOMETHING TO REMEMBER.     BACK IN BUSINESS   Not bad.     MORE   An acoustic/rehearsal version of this song was performed in the film by Madonna as \\"Breathless Mahoney\\". After \\"Big Boy Caprice\\" takes over Lips Manlus' club, as well as taking Breathless (who was Lips' flame) as his girl, he has Breathless and her back-up dancers / singers rehearse this for opening night. BIG BOY CAPRICE (To Breathless about 88 Keys): \\"The next time I crush fingers and turn them into pretzels, I just might do the same thing to your face\\".     WHAT CAN YOU LOSE (Performed by Madonna & Mandy Patinkin)   This duet between Madonna and Mandy Patinkin was also featured in the film, \\"Dick Tracy\\". Mandy Patinkin, himself, even had a supporting role in the film, as the pianist, \\"88 Keys\\". This song is rather good, but I wish Mandy would stick with what he's good at: Acting.     NOW I'M FOLLOWING YOU (Pt. 1) (Performed by Madonna & Warren Beatty)   Only over a minute long, but this song is really catchy.     NOW I'M FOLLOWING YOU (Pt. 2) (Performed by Madonna & Warren Beatty)   A great remix of \\"Now I'm Following You\\" (Part 1).    VOGUE   The album's first single. My favorite song off of this album. This song definitely defines Madonna of the 1990s and definitely defines Pop Music of the '90s. Great dance song here.     This is another one of Madonna's greatest albums. Mainly, every Madonna fan had bought this album only for \\"Vogue\\". I know I did, but after hearing the whole album, it became one of my favorites. Great album here.
B00127RAJY|5.0|It's awesome!!!! Great results with a healthy diet and doing the video 5 to 6 times a week. Really gets you into athletic shape.
B000002L6P|5.0|Madonna became a pretty big star when she released her first album entitled, MADONNA, in July of 1983. But what Madonna did expect was to become an even bigger star in November of 1984, over a year after the release of her first album. In November of 1984, Madonna released her second album entitled, LIKE A VIRGIN. Now, this album has the same style and sound as the first album, with Madonna continuing to dress up in the same style as she did for the first album, but in this situation, it did not matter, for Madonna was still very fresh and new, and because the fans did not care, since this album went on to become Madonna's first #1 album (Billboard Hot 200).     MATERIAL GIRL   The album's second single. This song may have hit the #2 position (Billboard Hot 100), but that doesn't mean that this song wasn't a huge hit for Madonna. This song is supposed to be Madonna stating that most women in the world are very materialistic, always wanting jewelery and furs and new dresses, and such. Madonna even pointed out the song's message in the music video, where she dressed up as 60s icon, Marilyn Monroe.    ANGEL   The album's third single. This song is one of Madonna's greatest and I am disappointed to know that a great song like this was never a hit.     LIKE A VIRGIN   The album's first single. This was Madonna's first-ever #1 hit (Billboard Hot 100). It was the song, just like the album, that made Madonna an even bigger star. This is one of the greatest songs Madonna has ever recorded. Madonna has even decided to sing this song on her CONFESSIONS TOUR.     OVER AND OVER   A great song with a great message, telling us to get up \\"Over And Over\\", if we are knocked down while trying to achieve our goals in life.     LOVE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE   Great.     DRESS YOU UP   The album's fourth & final single. What I love about this song is how Madonna, through words and sense of fashion, talks about how much she loves her boyfriend, telling him that, \\"...Gonna DRESS YOU UP in my love...\\".     SHOO-BEE-DOO   This is one of Madonna's prettiest ballads. I love that sax solo in the middle of the song.     PRETENDER   Not bad.     STAY   Not bad.     This album has proven that Madonna is here to stay. No matter what those airhead critics think or say, Madonna will remain the Queen Diva. This album shows that to us all, whether you are a fan or not.
B00009W0U4|1.0|I watched this movie and it was a real stinker.At the being I was dizzy because the camera guy was [...]with the camera moving it around like he was tripping on acid or something, a guys girlfriend gets her \\"[...]and raped and then the boyfriend and a friend go looking for the guy who did it and smash his [...]head in and kill him. The only thing good is the the Cover of this so called movie.
B000002LGQ|5.0|In March of 1989, Madonna released her fifth album entitled, LIKE A PRAYER. This album is the album that made Madonna an official sex symbol, as well as really directing her to her way of becoming a huge icon. This album has been chosen as a favorite amongst many of her adoring fans across the world. I am one of those fans, who heavily favors this amazing album.<br /><br />LIKE A PRAYER<br />The album's first single. What an awesome song. Madonna had, once again, found herself surrounded by the pointing fingers of her critics, due to the song's controversial music video. If you ask me, no matter how controversial the video was and is, this song and video are just way too awesome.<br /><br />EXPRESS YOURSELF<br />The album's second single. This song shot straight up to the #2 spot (Billboard Hot 200) and also became a anthem for many women, in being able to stand up to their men. The video version of the song is much different than this here album version. The video version is a completely remixed version.<br /><br />LOVE SONG (Performed by Madonna & Prince)<br />I used to hate this song with a passion. But, I really enjoy this song, because I recently became a fan of Prince.<br /><br />TILL DEATH DO US PART<br />Love this song. I love it ... love it ... love it.<br /><br />PROMISE TO TRY<br />This song is actually about the death of Madonna's mother. The song describes Madonna telling the little girl inside herself that she has to move on, where Madonna, herself, explains that it's difficult to let go, but she promises to try. This is a beautiful and touching ballad.<br /><br />CHERISH<br />The album's third single. What a great song. I could listen to this song all day.<br /><br />DEAR JESSIE<br />The album's fifth single, though, not released in the U.S. What a great fantasy-esque song.<br /><br />OH FATHER<br />The album's fourth single. The song is about how Madonna's father had became after Madonna's mother had passed away, due to breast cancer. In the video, Madonna shows exactly what the song is about, as well as showing what her marriage was like to Sean Penn. Personally, I think this is a beautiful song, and one of Madonna's best.<br /><br />KEEP IT TOGETHER<br />The album's sixth & final single. What a great song about remembering who your family is and where you truly came from.<br /><br />SPANISH EYES<br />Madonna seems to have a way with recording beautiful Spanish-influenced ballads. What a great song.<br /><br />ACT OF CONTRITION<br />This track was sort of shocking, but at the same time, pretty hilarious.<br /><br />This album is just incredibly outstanding.

B002KQ6BT6|4.0|good fast paced read. da vinci code goes to washington. history is fun. try it you will like it.
B000002L9S|5.0|In 1986, Madonna had released her third album entitled, TRUE BLUE. This album had shown us a new Madonna. The clunk jewelery and black outfits were gone. The rubber bracelets and clunk bracelets were gone. The lion's mane was now cut down to a bleach-blonde pixie style cut. And the outfits were now of a feminine Tom-Boy style. tHIS album is one of the many albums where Madonna has re-invented herself. And this album is another of one of the greatest albums Madonna has ever put out.     PAPA DON'T PREACH   The album's second single. This one of Madonna's greatest songs. In the song (and video), Madonna takes on the part of a teenage girl, who has been dating a boy she really loves. This boy has gotten her ... pregnant. But her boyfriend loves her to the point of moving in with her and helping her raise their child. But, Madonna has a problem ... telling her father, who will \\"Preach\\" to her about what she is doing is wrong. This song went on to become Madonna's fourth #1 hit single (Billboard Hot 100). The second #1 (Billboard Hot 100) was \\"Crazy For You\\" in 1985, and third #1 (Billboard Hot 100) was \\"Live To Tell\\", which I will get to in just a moment.     OPEN YOUR HEART   The album's fourth single. This was actually the first song I have heard from Madonna and it is the song that turned me into the huge fan that I am today. This song's music video is nothing short of a classic, where Madonna takes on the part of an Italin exotic dancer. The little boy in the video tries to get in to see Madonna, but is refused admission, where he stands outside, imagining what Madonna's performance is like. At the end of her performance, Madonna and the kid go running off into the sunset, just having plain old fun.     WHITE HEAT   This is a great song, and is named after the James Cagney movie of the same name. The movie was, I think, a Mob movie from the 1940s, and because this song is very similar to a Mob concept, Madonna named it after the original Cagney movie. Just so you know the excerpts you hear in the beginning and middle of the song, are actually of James Cagney in the film of the same name. On backing vocals is ... Richard Marx, another one of my favorite artists. He had done this the year before his self-titled debut album.     LIVE TO TELL   The album's first single. This song, while being Madonna's third #1 hit (Billboard Hot 100), was also the theme song to the 1986 thriller, \\"At Close Range\\", starring Christopher Walkin and Sean Penn (whom Madonna had been married to a year by the time of this album's release). This is one of the most beautiful ballads Madonna has ever recorded. The song is so haunting, yet so moving. Controversy had stirred up in 2006 when Madonna, after kicking off her CONFESSIONS TOUR, performed this song, while hung up on a mirrored cross, wearing a red blouse and the crown of the thorns, symbolizing Jesus' crucifixion. Madonna has stated that she did not do this to poke fun at the Catholic faith, but to point out the hatred in this world.     WHERE'S THE PARTY   Great party song.     TRUE BLUE   The album's third single. A great tune here.     LA ISLA BONITA   The album's first & final single. This is the first of two Madonna ballads to feature a Spanish influential sound. This is another one of Madonna's major hits and has been perfoming an uptempo version of this song on her CONFESSIONS TOUR.     JIMMY JIMMY   A little bubble-gummy, but the song is real catchy.     LOVE MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND   \\"Make Love, Not War We say\\", and that's exactly what we all should be doing: making love, not making war. A great song.     This album, in which Madonna had dedicated it to, \\"...My Husband, The Coolest Guy In The Universe...\\", is another one of the great ones in Madonna's catalogue. Make sure not to skip this one.

B002HNA95E|5.0|It's only taken 27 years for this woman to create the best \\"Greatest\\" hits collection I own.  Yes there are some great songs missing, I would have loved to see \\"Angel\\" on this, but really? The woman has had 40+ top 40 hits and 37 of them have entered the top ten, some songs would have to be omitted.  But trust me, Warner Bros, has done an awesome job with this musical retrospective.  Love her or hate her,  there is no denying, Madonna is and will always be the \\"Greatest\\" female artist of our generation!
B001FB4VZS|3.0|Smallville is one of those TV shows where I wait until it comes out on DVD before watching it. The reviews I had seen really had me worried that Season 8 was a big leftdown. I can tell you that it is not. It is actually pretty good (for the most part).<br /><br />Smallville Season 8 has some really good moments and it continues to build the Clark Kent/Superman character (abeit slowly). I was impressed with the freshness added with some of the new characters like Tess Mercer and Davis Bloom. I really enjoyed the building relationship of Clark and Lois. I have to say that Erica Durance really nailed the Lois Lane part in this season. Overall, the show finally seems to be moving toward something interesting, that being Clark's destiny to take up the role of Superman and start acting like him. The whole first half of this season, up until the episode called Legion was outstanding.<br /><br />That said. Things change when Lana Lang returns and then ends up sticking around for a while!! In my opinion, she should have left after just two espisodes (after Legion, which would have been perfect). But no, the whole Clark/Lana relationship thing has to flare up again. I am so sick and tired of this!. It never ends! I've gotten to the point where I can't stand the Lana Lang character. I find myself saying things to the TV screen like, \\"JUST GO AWAY ALREADY!!!!\\" Admittedly, the Clark/Lana thing WAS cute when they were in high school, but they should have ditched her character after Season 4. By far, this was the biggest mistake the writers and creators of this show ever made. The second was that the Lex Luthor character had way too much exposure and also became tiresome. For me, the fact that Lex is mostly absent from Season 8 is a good thing. But I would welcome him back as a villian when the time is right.<br /><br />That rant aside, Smallville Season 8 is still good. I would easily given it 4 stars instead of 3 if it weren't for Lana Lang. To be fair, I don't blame Kristen Kreuk. You can she really tries hard to make the best of what the writers give her. Unfortunately, the character is just laughable at this point.tries hard to make the best of what the writers give her. Unfortunately, the character is just laughable at this point.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Downright amazing. I've been producing music for 10 years. I'm hearing things i couldnt possibly hear on my event ps8 studio monitors. Alot of people complain that the highs are too ovepowering but they are actually spot on accurate. I have heard overwhelming highs in many mixes but when you put on a well mixed song everything is spot on. These will tell you who can master tracks and who cannot. Many people over power the high end in mixes because it can be hard to hear on speakers. If you take these same tracks to a large speaker PA system you will hear it and it will disapoint the crowds if not blow their eardrums. Well now you no longer need to worry. These headphones are perfect.

0060254920|5.0|As a kid I loved where the wild things are. It's high adventure that appeals to every roaming fantasy a young boy has. It's about wearing a wolf-suit, exploration, taming monsters, and becoming a King. It was also the very first book I read to my son. The greatest moment was when, at 2 years of age, I was on the train and these two lovely old ladies approached him and started cooing and making faces. And with a very serious expression my son raised his hand, and said in his 2 year old gibberish, \\"Ve stweill.\\" It was only later that I realised he was doing exactly as Max had done when he tames the monsters with his magic trick, and says: \\"Be Still!\\"    It's the book I read to him when he had a three day stay at the hospital and it stopped him crying. Countless times it has been the only thing to stop him crying when he's been sick. I cannot give this book high enough praise.     Durand Welsh
0385504225|3.0|I mostly enjoyed the book, but it's no Da Vinci Code.  Tough act to follow.  The ending was a bit of a letdown, and while I pretty much agree with Brown's take on organized religion, he really does get long-winded and preachy about it.
0316044938|4.0|'The Lovely Bones\\" is the kaleidoscopic tale of one Susie Salmon, a highschooler who is murdered in the early '70s by her neighbor, Mr. Harvey. From her new vantage point in heaven, Susie observes her family, friends and murderer as they drift apart and together over the course of decades.     While some of it was rather sophomoric and predictable, I found the \\"The Lovely Bones\\" packed a good deal of emotional wallop. The characters were real and sympathetic, and the plot was both intriguing and convincing. With the Salmons, Sebold paints a beautifully-rendered and tragic family, and in Susie she has a funny, insightful narrator. Her version of heaven left a bit to be desired, however. While not central to the plot, it was Godless and rather one-note, and I found it took a bit of effort to suspend disbelief.     Nit-pickings aside, I can safely say that this is one of the best novels on the afterlife that I've ever read. It's a fast, thoughtful and entertaining novel from a very promising author. I rarely re-read books, but I'll certainly be coming back to this one down the road. Bravo.
B002KVSJ64|4.0|Unlike \\"Phobia\\" where every track could have been a single, \\"Dear Agony\\" is a little bit dull. The music got a bit harder again, but the melodies aren't as strong anymore. Some songs literally die in their own noise. Breaking Benjamin have never been known for writing the most intelligent lyrics, and most songs are still very superficial and full of clichés.    However, there are still some strong tracks on the album, first of all \\"Without You\\", the strongest song by miles.
0061478784|4.0|I too got turned on to Diana Wynne Jones after the Howl's Moving Castle anime. I read her Chrestomanci series first and now I finally read this book. Many reviews have already done a decent summary, Sophie, the eldest of 3 sisters is resigned to the fate of the fairy-tale trope 'eldest child' who stays home and isn't successful. Even from the beginning however, DWJ shows that she's bent on turning tropes on their heads. The step-mom is young, pretty and kind to Sophie. The step-sisters love each other, the most beautiful and beloved sister isn't the main character but one of the other sisters, etc.<br />The main problem I had with the story is that a lot of 'obvious' things weren't obvious at all, especially Calcifer's clues. Even though I knew from the anime what the 'contract' was supposed to be, his hints were so vague that I ONLY knew they were hints because i had knowledge before-hand.<br />Near the ending, a million characters come out of nowhere and it's frustrating when all the readers want to see is Sophie and Howl have their moment with 20 people interrupting and pulling at their sleeves.<br />Howl wasn't a very enticing character and I really wasn't rooting for a romance while reading the book, the 'moment' at the end was super rushed as if DWJ was saying 'Oh yeah, here's the obligatory fairy-tale romance at the end.'<br />All in all i think it was one of DWJ's best efforts. I'd recommend watching the anime first because DWJ is not very descriptive at all, the story is very action-oriented.
0142410349|5.0|FANTASTIC MR. FOX is an enjoyable children's book in the traditions of the classic fairy tale and the mischievous fun of the old school Disney cartoons.  The human characters are typical of the Roald Dahl antagonist -- selfish, greedy, and sometimes sadistic farmers Boggis, Bunce and Bean are caricatures that seem to boast the shadier characteristics of the old Dickens baddies and the absentmindedness of Mr. Gumby of Monty Python fame.  The hero -- Mr. Fox, of course -- is loveable and brave as well as cunning and witty.  Though mindful of his three aforementioned enemies he shows great compassion to his neighbors.    Unlike some other of Dahl's stories, FANTASTIC MR. FOX is without any crude or even strange humor.  There is nothing here to offend or confound.  It's simply good, clean fun for reading silently or aloud.
0385504225|3.0|This is an okay novel. It is a \\"bestseller\\", not a work of literature. Read it on a rainy day for the story (which unfortunately has all the weaknesses highlighted in other reviews), but read with low expectations. Like watching a made-for-TV movie. I would guess that the movie will solve a lot of the weaknesses, maybe even improving the ending so it is not so obvious.    Borrow from the library or wait for paperback if you want more value.
B001AVCFJM|1.0|This glossy oilslick of a movie should really by titled Abrams Trek Wars as it's really a Star Wars ripoff using Star Trek characters.  JJ Abrams is on public record as saying he never liked Star Trek nor did he understand it and it shows in every cel of this film.  Maybe if he and his writers had done their research and read about the Star Trek backstory, they could have made a watchable film.  Instead, they tossed 40 years of other people's hard work out the window so they could invent their own alternate Star Trek reality where they could make up anything that they wanted even if it doesn't make any sense.  The film makers said before it was released that this movie was based on Star Trek canon but that's not true.  Almost none of it is canon.    What we get in the finished product is a two-hour long Special Effect held together by flimsy attempts at a plot involving tired sci-fi cliches that have been stolen from other Abrams projects: time travel (Lost), alternate reality (Fringe), and a magical, unexplained object, Red Matter (Rambaldi artifact from Alias).  The basic premise has been stolen from Star Wars A New Hope:  Romulan Nero is Grand Moff Tarkin, his ship the Narada is the Death Star, Old Spock is Princess Leia, and the destruction of Vulcan is the destruction of Alderaan.  Other sources ripped off for this film:  An Officer and a Gentleman, Aeon Flux, Sky High, The Black Hole, Battlestar Galactica, Stargate, etc.      Clearly, Abrams and co. spent way too much time on how this movie should look, and not nearly enough time on crafting a good story with good characters and development.  All the writers did was lift some familiar lines and icons from previous Star Trek incarnations as well as other sci fi classics, and stitch them together haphazardly hoping that would be enough to satisfy the audience.  There are pretty costumes that belong on a fashion runway, not a working military, and an Enterprise that looks like it starred in an episode of Pimp MyRide.  The actors were hired for their looks, not any acting ability they might have.  The action sequences are boring, poorly choreographed, and poorly shot, and repetitive.  Kirk hanging off the edge of a cliff or similar high ledge while a villain looms over him is repeated 3 times!      As for Kirk himself, who's supposed to be the hero of this film, he comes across as a drunken cheating loser who tags along for the adventure, loses every fight he's in, makes no command decisions, does what other people tell him, and yet he's the only character at the end who gets rewarded for saving the day.  He's a poor role model compared to the original Kirk who was strong, smart, confident, and earned his position as Captain by working hard through all the ranks of Starfleet and proving he deserved his position.    In the end, JJ Abrams has made a mediocre film that's unimaginative, uninspired, and ultimately empty.  There's no sense of wonder and not an ounce of Gene Roddenberry's vision anywhere in it.  The lack of care put into making this film shows Abrams' disdain for Star Trek, sci fi in general, and his audience.  It was made for reasons of money and ego, and that makes it what is known as an exploitation film.
1932907009|1.0|The dichotomy of Art and Commerce is especially stark in Hollywood. I guess there are people who say \\"I want to be rich, so I'm going to write a screenplay and sell it for millions of dollars instead of, you know, work or learn a trade.\\" If you are one of them, this is your book. But I think most people who actually take the time to write a full screenplay are doing it because they have a story they really want to tell. And this book will make those people want to tear their hair out.  My friend, noted TV writer Eddie Gorodetsky says \\"Hollywood is the place where people run to where lightning just struck.\\" That's the operating principle in Save the Cat. And it's not completely stupid. People who buy movies want to buy what made a huge amount of money last. But if you have an idea for a movie that you want to make, or even want to see, this will not tell you anything about how to write it. It's all about sales and it made me want to puke.

B002IVLH6A|2.0|After nearly 20 years, Pearl Jam has refined their sound in such a way, that some of their songs hardly even sound like Pearl Jam.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, as there are several good songs on this CD.  I wish amazon offered half-star ratings, because I'd give this album 2.5 stars.  It's certainly not their best, but not their worst effort either (but close).  I'll break each song down, and give an ever-brief synopsis.<br /><br />1. Gonna See My Friend (5/10) - Sets the tone for this unique Pearl Jam record.  Obvious punk influences, was a little put off by it at first, but it's an average song.<br />2. Got Some (8/10) - One of the standout songs on the CD.  Upbeat, energetic, excellent lyrics, catchy tempo and chorus.  Definite winner.<br />3. The Fixer (7/10) - I didn't like this song at first, since it was released as a single, but now that I've listened to the album, it fits, and I actually enjoy it somewhat.  Another punk-influenced song that sounds unlike anything PJ has ever done.<br />4. Johnny Guitar (2/10) - One of the worst songs on the CD.  Corny lyrics, and just bores me to death.  Gave it 10 listens or so, now it's an instant skip.<br />5. Just Breathe (7/10) - Depending on what kind of mood you're in, this can either be a 10/10, or a 2/10.  It's a very 'earthy' kind of song, that would have fit in perfectly with the \\"Into the Wild\\" soundtrack.  This song is ALL Eddie, and it's a meditative piece that's very compelling.<br />6. Amongst the Waves (4/10) - Uncharacteristic upbeat lyrics -- doesn't do much for me, but I can see some people really digging it.<br />7. Unthought Known (6/10) - Another average song, good all around.  Has a pretty dynamic piano driven beat, especially midway through the song that I find riveting.<br />8. Supersonic (3/10) - Yet another mega-punk influenced song.  Perhaps more so than any other song on the album.  It really doesn't do much for me.<br />9. Speed of Sound (8/10) - Semi-Ballad, very strong lyrics, intense, meditative song.  Emotionally driven, compelling.  Good song.<br />10. Force of Nature (8/10) - Initially made a strong impact on me, but after a few listens, I just think it's a \\"good\\" song.<br />11. The End (6/10) - Strong ending to the album. Introspective ballad.  Another meditative song, to close a very unique CD.<br /><br />2.5 stars.  In my opinion, Pearl Jam's 3rd worst album (behind Riot Act and Binaural).compelling.

The band isn't the same without Layne, but they are definitely still AIC and William is about as good a replacement as you could hope for.  This is a definite must buy.

B0001MDP3G|5.0|As a guy who's lived all his 45 years in North Carolina, I know this jewel of a film gets so much flack for absolutely no reason.  The criticisms are:  1-It's not a real war movie.  2-It sympathizes with southerners.  3-It's a chick flick.  4-It's a low-key drama.  5-It was filmed in Europe.  6-Foreigners play the two leads.  7-It's not 101 percent faithful to the great novel.  Look people, even if all of the above are true, this can still be a great film, and it is.<br /><br />Zellwegger, for her endearing performance, so deserved her win as best supporting actress.  The film ought to have won in other categories in which it was nominated.  Kidman and Law are excellent.  Cold Mountain is such a realistic depiction of home life during the Civil War.  I've never seen a film as faithful to the original source material.  The characters are people alive with their fear of the war.  Guys will like the movie just as much as gals.  There is an epic battle to satisfy the war buffs.<br /><br />The producers and director do a wonderful job of convincing us that Romanian locations are actually Carolina terrain.  If you want to experience what the Civil War was like for everyday people, this is it.  Treat yourself to this valuable slice-of-life re-creation.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I cannot honestly believe that some people (Sushi-whatever his name is from Boise and G-Money) have panned this album....It is a smashing success for one of the few bands out there that hasn't ever sold-out and has always followed their own star.  This is definitely still Alice in Chains, only some people are way too concerned with harping on the fact that William Duvall is not, in fact, an exact clone of Layne Staley.  The fact still remains that Duvall harmonizes in that same eerie yet beautiful fashion with Cantrell, and he has a similarly powerful voice and delivery to that of Layne Staley.  I don't think that A.I.C. has disappointed its fans who truly understand and appreciate music...maybe just those who want another \\"Facelift\\" or \\"Dirt.\\"  I for one am glad to see that they have maintained their unique chemistry and sound while at the same time produced an edgy, rock-hard album that isn't a regurgitation of their previous work (not too say that their previous work wasn't great).  This album is decidedly more progressive in the sense that some of the chord progressions and melodies are complex (i.e., utilize more than just pentatonic, blues-based scales and modes).  I also would like to dispel the notion that this album sounds like \\"Jar of Flies\\" (that reviewer is totally wrong on that).  While there are some softer songs on the album, I find it to be predominantly a very dark and heavy album.  In overall sound, I would say it is more of a mix of Jerry's solo stuff and old A.I.C. (the vocal harmonies are very reminiscent of A.I.C.).    Don't let the nay-sayers fool you into skipping over this album....it would be a mistake on your part (by the way \\"G-money,\\" the Mars Volta definitely have put out way crappier songs than any A.I.C. song and, while Mastodon is a great band, there are definitely some duds on their records as well).  This album may not be EXACTLY the same as old A.I.C. albums were, but it shouldn't be.  It still rocks.
B0025KVLS8|2.0|As many have already said, the song quality is not balanced. Some sound great but others sound better in mono.    However, my reason for giving this a low rating is because of their pain-in-the butt copyguard protection. If you plan on listening to this CD on your computer...forget it. It worked fine in a DVD player or stereo but when I went into my office and put it into my computer, all I could access was a video documentary. The CD would NOT play the songs on the album and the company did not provide a way to do it. Considering that I and millions of others use their computer as their main \\"stereo\\", I consider this to be a BIG problem. As it turned, out my less than $30 audio-editing software, could easily read the tracks and I copied them to my  computer, so I can listen to it whenever I want.    I bought four of the re-mastered albums and I was planning on buying more but after the above, I won't purely on principle. In this day and age, to have to jump through hoops to listen to a CD on a computer after buying it, is ridiculous.
B000P0J0DI|5.0|Briefly said - \\"Unforgiven\\" looks like a western, where two cowboys cut the face of a whore; whores seeking revenge, spread the rumor that they would pay a thousand dollar prize to any killer who would kill \\"them\\" cowboys; some killers could not make it and were repelled by the sheriff; but eventually killers killed those cowboys, the sheriff and his deputies. And the last man standing was of course William Munny, the killer, played by Clint Eastwood.    This is the description of the events, but \\"Unforgiven\\" is not about the events, it's not really a western either. This movie is about people, struggling to live some life and being always unforgiven for that. All of them had lost directions in their lives, all of them understand good and evil at some intuitive level of their own.   The movie does not depict honorable women, tough good fellows, witty winners, slick riders. Tough Little Bill is brutally tough, witty English bob lost miserably, and William Munny can hardly climb the horse.   This movie is a drama and only the final shoot out reminds about a western, but even this shoot out is depicted to be humanly slow, hesitant and dangerous. The final glance of William Munny is of course the famous glance of Clint Eastwood and yet again with the shadow of alcoholic agitation.   \\"Unforgiven\\" is a true masterpiece.     At the end the idea of the movie is that people have to be resolute. When the common moral grounds are low the resoluteness becomes the honor, and the voyeurism of by-standers like the writer, who \\"never had a gun\\", becomes the utterly disgusting, ignoble.

159102594X|4.0|Joe Abercrombie writes one hell of a debut in The Blade Itself, the first installment of his First Law trilogy.    The story basically follows half a dozen characters' points of view and two or three major plotlines spread out over a fictional world (in later books revealed to be called simply the Circle of the World).  Each character, while some perhaps are not easily likable, are incredibly intriguing and well-developed.  Abercrombie aptly changes his narrative voice for each character, each possessing his or her own characteristics; one has internal dialogues with himself, another will say something, then reveal they just imagined saying that.  Very interesting stuff.  The only character I found to be not as complex and interesting as the others was the Dogman; he just felt like a stereotypical barbarian archetype.  He's still interesting enough, but nowhere near as interesting as the others.    This book, and in fact all of Abercrombie's work thus far, is purely character driven.  The story in this installment is clearly in the 'set-up' stages, and while it does come together better in later books, it's too disparate in this one to utterly engage the reader.  However, as i mentioned, the excellent characters more than make up for that, and there are several truly surprising moments where characters will do something you did not expect.    The action, too, is another strongpoint of Abercrombie's.  He has a way of making the fights and battles flow, somehow simultaneously beautifully and gruesomely, but be forewarned.  This stuff is not for the faint of heart.    Once you start the First Law trilogy you won't be able to stop until you finish all of it.  The Blade Itself is a great start to a wickedly entertaining ride.
B0025KVLTW|5.0|Not sure why some people are ragging all over the re-mastering, but I have the original CD released in 1987, and this one sounds 100% better.  Played both versions in my car and I could most definitaly hear a difference. Worth the price.
B000002VMD|5.0|I couldn't tell any difference between the appearance or sound quality of this cd and others I have bought brand new. Excellent Quality!
0385504225|2.0|I waited anxiously for years for the follow up to \\"The DaVinci Code.\\" Unfortunately, the wait was not worth it. Rather than becoming a more proficient writer, Dan Brown has actually regressed. The writing is so high school. Robert Langdon is no longer a compelling character as he once was. It appears as though Dan Brown was just looking to write another Langdon adventure to ensure greater sales. Don't waste your money. I'd say wait for the movie, but \\"Angels and Demons\\" was a weak flick it may be best just to spend your money on some other book.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Fabulous!!! Whitney has returned as wonderful as ever! Her voice has matured some and she doesn't quite have the same incredible vocal range. But her songs are powerful and span the genres. I loved them all! I've been eagerly awaiting her rebirth and she does NOT disappoint!!
B002HNA95E|5.0|This is a fantastic CD collection. Even though I already own all of these songs on other albums, I needed to get this CD for three reasons.<br /><br />1. It's Madonna! And I buy all of her CDs no matter what! She is a GODDESS!<br /><br />2. Who cares if I already own 34 of these songs already? Now I have all of Madonna's Top 10 hits in one place. The track sequence is perfect and the sound quality is phenomenal.<br /><br />3. There are two awesome new songs on here, \\"Celebration\\" and \\"Revolver.\\" Love them, love them, LOVE THEM!<br /><br />One criticism...what happened to \\"4 Minutes\\"?! The editing team butchered that track for some reason. Major bummer! However, I forgive them, because Madonna is Queen. Enough said!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I've been a Friends fan for years and have watched the episodes over and over and everytime they still make me laugh out loud. I would reccommend buying this set for anyone who is a fan of the show, its definately worth it!<br /><br />The packaging is really neat, and the book that comes with it has some photos of the cast and snap shots of a few of the episodes. Its also has a brief description of every episode.
B002BE7JE8|5.0|A voodoo obsessed serial murderer named Charles Lee Ray (Brad Douriff) who is known as the notorious Lakeshore Strangler is one of the city's most infamous killers. He was chased then gunned down by a police dective named Detective Norris (Chris Sarandon) to death. The next day, a 6 year old boy named Andy Barclay (Alex Vincient) just had a birthday and his mother Karen (Catherine Hicks) buys him a Good-Guy doll named Chucky for him and the boy loves it. Andy has gotten more then he gets as murders and accidents start happening as the boy believes his doll is responsible as no one believes him not even his mother, it turns out the doll is possessed by Ray as it's purpose is to use the boy for his evil and wants his soul.<br /><br />Stylish and masterful horror thriller from director Tom Holland (\\"Fright Night\\") and writer Don Mancini who gave birth to a horror legend named Chucky. The film started out as an idea by Don Mancini and producer David Kirschner based off the whole Cabbage Patch Kids and Teddy Ruxpin craze with voodoo themes to it. Mancini was influenced by films like the Anthony Hopkins horror thriller \\"Magic\\", the Twilight Zone TV show and 1975's \\"Trilogy of Terror\\". The performances are quite well done even by The Incredible Hulk's Jack Colvin, Kevin Yagher's special effects even on Chucky are just outstanding even in today's CGI realm. This movie has stood quite well terrifying generations of children on their fear of dolls as it spawned 4 sequels, wannabes and of course a reboot/remake in the works from the same creator.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray has incredible picture and sound with a suprisingly good High Def transfer with extras like featurettes, trailer, audio commentaries and widescreen standard def DVD included.
B000063DI9|5.0|The last great album of genre defining career, `Seventh Son of a Seventh Son' was also the last album to feature the band's most important lineup. So it truly was the end of an era....and what an era!! The LP was Maiden's first true concept album and the concept would seem to be the brainchild of band vocalist Bruce Dickinson whose fascination with the occult had already been visited in such classics as \\"Revelations\\" and \\"Powerslave\\" and in his own solo material. Notably absent from the last album, Dickinson's songwriting returned in full force and as a result `SSSS' is a marked improvement over the previous LP.  The album also claimed four top ten singles in the UK, a remarkable achievement and was also Maiden's last platinum selling record in the US.  The synth layered sound was also in attendance and it did nothing to compromise the metal onslaught. True classics include the four singles \\"Can I Play with Madness\\", \\"Evil That Me Do\\", \\"The Clairvoyant\\" and \\"Infinite Dreams\\". The album cuts such as the title track and album opener \\"Moonchild\\" are just as important as well. The storyline seems to follow the life and times of some sort of doomed prophet, the \\"Seventh Son\\" but as other reviewers have mentioned, each cut can be enjoyed independently....which isn't always the case with concepts.  Sadly, Adrian Smith would fall victim to album/tour burnout as he felt his ideas needed further expression than Steve Harris seemed willing to give, so he left for about a ten year hiatus. Maiden would soldier on, but the band was never the same....until now! Seven deadly sins....seven ways to win...
B00127RAJY|5.0|Good, effective, cheap. It gets a little old after a while, but not any more than any other video.
B000063DHL|4.0|`Somewhere in Time' was for many fans a step down from the lofty rise to glory that was Iron Maiden's ascendance to the top of the metal heap in the mid-Eighties.  After the marathon world tour of 1984-1985, the band returned to the studio with one major problem. One of their chief songwriters, Bruce Dickinson, seemed to be suffering a case of writer's block. It could have been a case of mental exhaustion or a need to take a step to recultivate his creative juices but for whatever the reason, Dickinson was noticeably absent in the creative process. Adrian Smith continued his writing prowess and it was he and band leader Steve Harris that contributed the songs. \\"Wasted Years\\", the LP's first single and possibly the best song written by Adrian features his stunning lead guitar as the main melody line and was nearly a crossover single into more the mainstream album rock stations that had previously ignored the band. The song's live for today message struck a chord and \\"Wasted Years\\" remains the most memorable selection on an album that really didn't have as many as previous classics. \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\", another Adrian song and \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" round out a best of from `Time' which included the usual epic tracks but this time with the exception of \\"Heaven\\" and maybe \\"Alexander the Great\\", nothing noteworthy stands out. The band was now using synths to flush out their sound and to their credit, the metal doesn't seem watered down as a result (unfortunately the same can't be said for Judas Priest....eeeshh!).  \\"Somewhere in Time\\" was the one Eighties album that I have a hard time putting in the same rarified as anything else from the decade. Good, chancy, solid but unspectacular metal from masters of the form.
B002KGVB9G|1.0|This import Studio Canal is no better than an upscaled DVD. Detail is lost, or non-existent. I had hopes for this transfer since Criterion lost the rights to remaster and this appears, no, shows, that the DVD master was transfered directly to Bluray.       Don't waste your money if you have the DVD. Criterion is one of the few who values quality. Hopefully, Criterion will have rights to remaster this great work properly. The film's opening credits are fuzzy yet the English subtitles are sharp. I believe Studio Canal used the original DVD master and only upgraded the subtitles for this release. I suspected that this would be the situation when I haven't seen any feedback about this release. I will think twice before I pre-order again.    Criterion's excellent release of \\"In The Realm of the Senses\\" makes this Studio Canal transfer look worse than Gladiator. I truly regret paying so much for an import that isn't a true highdef product. This total disregard for quality is what makes the average person think that paying extra for high def when this is the result is foolish, and they are correct when this is an example of what is being released.    Avoid at all costs and hope for a Criterion release.

0385504225|4.0|I was looking forward to this book after reading all of Dan Brown's other books, Devils and Angels[[ASIN:074349346X Angels & Demons: A Novel (Robert Langdon)]], four in the morning three days. So whats bothering me? The ending! Yes the book was action packed...Yes it was very informative.Yes I still consider Mr Brown a genius at uncovering little known truths about past secret societies. He writes very well and connects all elements of the story well. The \\"villian\\" in \\"The Lost Symbol\\" was very well descripted, but a bit repetitive about his final goal. Probably Mr Brown should have put the last few chapters before the thrilling, dramatic end..It reminded me of Ann Rice writing very good Vampire thrillers and then making a left turn into The Devil and God rationale according to Ann Rice. The treasure being sought did not turn out to be as materially real as in his previous novels, but rather more esoteric. It was good, entertaining, but I expected a more \\"real\\", tangible treasure!!!
B0029LHW4U|1.0|I own every AIC album and DVD they have put out, so you guys can keep the \\"real fan\\" BS comments to yourself. If Jerry had released this as a solo album, I would give it 3 stars as there are a couple good tracks here, but nothing in comparison to the Staley/Cantrell combo.  I guess money talks and it was just too tempting to release an \\"AIC\\" album instead of another solo album.  You guys enjoy... I will be listening to new Mastodon, The Mars Volta, etc.  Jerry should take a clue from other classy and successful artists like Dave Grohl.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|There are plenty of reviews of this album already so I'm not going to repeat the praises that others have written.  Some of my favorite Beatles songs are on this album as well as a couple that I think should never have seen the light of day.  My only complaint is the size of the print of the lyrics.  Did the publisher of this CD realize that anyone who was a Beatles fan when this album came out is over 50 and will need a magnifying glass to read them.  Well I know all the words so I guess it doesn't matter.  Enjoy.
0439023483|5.0|This was such an interesting story of a brave young women!  I can't wait to read the other book!!
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I never been the biggest fan of AIC...I grew up in the 90s and always heard the popular songs, I was always into more Extreme Metal and Punk. That being said once I heard about the reunion and heard \\"A looking in View\\" I was instantly blown away. The whole album has amazing vocal harmonies and awesome riffs backed up by good song writing. The new singer really stands out as well. Buy this now
B00004TJKI|5.0|Visited the little town in the U.P. were this movie was made and were the actual murder took place. Great movie!!
B002BEXFW8|5.0|Super deal.    Right on time  In perfect condition  Right price    Can only recommend this seller * * * * *
B00278U1W0|2.0|Color me VERY disappointed.<br /><br />I'm of the same generation as Clapton and Winwood, was born and raised abroad, and was there for The Spencer Davis Group, Yardbirds, Traffic, John Mayall, etc.<br /><br />Couldn't wait for my Blu-Ray to arrive but when it did my excitement ended.  I have no quarrel with the playlist but I have never seen Clapton look so bored and the overall total lack of excitement was almost tangible.  I have to agree with reviewer Anthonious - No chemistry, no spontaneity.  These guys were just going through the motions.  If it wasn't for the interviews I would have given 1 star.<br /><br />Don't accuse me of nit-picking when I criticize the sound quality.  It is awful !!  I am not a fanatic with a high end system who listens to the system and not the music, ready to pounce on any imperfection.  Other than the very obvious distortion there is no dynamic range whatsoever - soft passages and loud passages all come through at the same level.  Please also understand that I and others buy Blu-Ray for the picture AND the sound quality.<br /><br />Let me add my name to those recommending Jeff Beck at Ronnie Scotts.  Clapton fans, if you don't already own [[ASIN:B00005OM5L Eric Clapton - Live in Hyde Park]] get it now.  But be warned, if you loved the Clapton/Winwood disk, viewing these two will make you see things differently.
B000VI6T6U|5.0|I've had the album of Hendrix' Pop Festival performance for more than forty years.  I believe his performance there was never surpassed.  This video captures that performance, and puts it into the context of the Festival's evolution.  I think this video is superb.  Music performance videos have certainly evolved over the years, some ways to their benefit, other ways...maybe not so beneficial.  But this video has the impact of a well-produced documentary, done by people who loved the music and the performers, and who recognized the significance of the magical times they were living in.
0307269981|5.0|This book did not draw me in at first. Having just finished The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, I wondered how someone who had not read Tattoo could feel any empathy for Lisbeth Salander, clearly the main character in Stieg Larsson's The Girl Who Played With Fire. As the book begins, Salander, 26, is filthy rich (literally, because she stole a fortune from a very dirty man), and she has an affair with a sixteen year old boy. Larsson bores us with details of her IKEA shopping spree and purchase of a luxury apartment. So, for the first hundred pages or so, I though of tossing the book. But it picked up. The last four hundred pages made it all worthwhile.<br /><br />The book pivots off of Salander's involvement in a triple murder. Just how dirty is she? Strong evidence points to her guilt. The police think she is guilty and launch a massive hunt for her. The media spreads stories all over Sweden about her bizarre past.<br /><br />But Salander has friends. There's the resourceful Mikael Blomkvist, star of Tattoo. There's a champion boxer who punches his way into the mix. There's a former guardian who grew to respect her.  There's Miriam Wu, Salander's (part-time) lover.<br /><br />Salander is one of the most intriguing fictional characters that I have encountered. She's a \\"waif,\\" very short and thin. She's brilliant. She's fierce. She must have total revenge, and she is cold and tough enough to get it. And, at least according to the title, she plays with fire.<br /><br />Other key characters include an evil Russian defector who is shielded by top Swedish officials and a malevolent \\"blond giant\\" who can feel no pain. A key plot element is the imminent publication of an expos&eacute; of sex-trafficking and the johns involved.<br /><br />So, there's a lot going on. Lesser authors could not have drawn it all together. But Larsson does, in a skillful and exciting manner.<br /><br />This book, combined with Tattoo, make it clear to me that the world lost a master wordsmith with Larsson's early death.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Does it live up to all the hype? Well, yes and no. The DaVinci Code was a best seller because, fact or fiction, readers liked all the secrets and revelations contained in the plot. Naturally, if Dan Brown wanted to replicate his original success, it was necessary for The Lost Symbol to use the same formula.<br /><br />This time, instead of focusing on the Catholic Church and Mary Magdalene, Brown chose to direct his energies towards the Freemasons, a veritable treasure trove of symbolism, myth and conspiracy theories.<br /><br />Any-hoo, if you liked The DaVinci Code, you may enjoy this read as well. But beware that much of the novelty of protagonist Robert Langdon's revelations have worn off. Instead of riveting you to the page, this time around you may feel a bit tired of the lecturing Harvard professor.
B001TKKAJG|1.0|I am very amazed that most of the reviews are so positive regarding the sound.The sound is terrible, in fact I gave my sacd to a buddy because the sound was so bad I could not listen to it. The sonics are flat,no low end,no dynamics flat treble and midrange. Lifeless and dull. There is just no doubt about this,so how can people write that   the sound is good?I have about 100 sacd's, so I should know.The music is also overrated,but some tracks are good.
0452295548|4.0|Needed this book for a paper in my neuroscience class. Really cheap and good quality!
0385504225|1.0|The tale didn't work for me from line one.  How is a reader to accept that a society, so secretive its members would sacrifice their lives before letting priceless knowledge fall into the wrong hands, could allow a newcomer into its uppermost ranks in exchange for a cash contribution?
B001AQR3E4|5.0|The blu ray looks great. It's an older movie so not as sharp as new releases. This movie is gorgeous. I just wish their were more special features. How about a director's cut or at least some deleted scenes. When originally released in theaters, rumor had it that some violent scenes were cut (Loius killing a priest). Buy this.
0439023491|4.0|I finished this book last night.  I really enjoyed it, but not as much as The Hunger Games.  It's not as intense as The Hunger Games, but it's more violent and gory.  I would have liked another ending (didn't see this ending coming), but I see that it's setting us up for a 3rd book, so I can live with it.<br /><br />I did like reading more about Peeta in this book.  I've always liked him, but  he really seemed to mature.  He is as likeable as ever, but more of his character shines through in this book.<br /><br />This book is at a great price (both books are) at Amazon.  They sell for $15 each at our local bookstore.  I ordered w/ free s/h, so it was a great deal!
B00009RDGA|3.0|This  also is a movie we hadn't viewed in a long time and one that we enjoyed the talents of Tatum O'Neal and her Dad, Ryan O'Neal. They made a good team.
0385504225|2.0|Dan Brown's first two books, Angels and Demons and Da Vinci Code, are true thrillers. This book fails. The plot starts out with great promise but quickly degenerates into a series of predictable and tiresome sequences. The \\"bad guy\\" is a loner and this becomes apparent 1/3 of the way into the book. By then, one quickly realizes that what a single person could do to harm the protagonists is really limited, and so the sense of drama is quickly lost. The whole parallel plot about the CIA's involvement looked promising, but it was so prosaic (they're the good guys, much to my disappointment) that it turned into a huge let down for me. The worst part of the book is the ending. The final 30 or so pages are completely superfluous. By the time I got to the last section, the \\"bad guy\\" had died and the drama had ended. Still, the story dragged on, hinting at the revelation of a deep mystery. I felt compelled to plod on, but more I read, angrier I became. It was all religious and philosophical fluff. I felt cheated. The Da Vinci Code was way better. Be warned!
1881273873|5.0|I found this book helped me to understand a lot more about my past, and what I need to do now to have a happier future.  I was able to learn so much about love.  It changed the way I see people in a big way.  I would recommend this book to any single.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I purchased this study Bible and after seeing all it offered an individual who desires to improve their knowledge, I have spent more time time reading and studying this Bible than all the other Bibles I own.  This is a great study guide.
0439023483|5.0|My 13 y/o son read this book in 2 1/2 days and loved it.  He kept telling me about it, so I read it when he was done.  I read it from cover to cover in 2 days. The book is filled with drama and really does have a plot that is life or death.  It's also about deciding what you would do in a certain situation - situations where the \\"lesser of two evils\\" is the only choice to make.  I really liked Katniss.  She has had a tough life and has made the best of it. She is tough; a real survivor.      I think this book is perfect for ages 12 and up.  It's a bit gory in places.....
0307266303|5.0|If you are interested in the human body and what it can and cannot do, this book is very interesting. I loved reading about the canyon in Mexico where the people live as they did a thousand years ago. The book is easy to read. I couldn't put it down.
B001KW0C96|4.0|A very solid drama movie! Wow! De Niro and Pacino are great in this movie! The story is about a cop who is a serial killer of those who \\"escape\\" traditional justice. Great characters and alot of suspense. Well worth the time to watch it.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|This add-on is awesome... the original L2 and R2 buttons are awkward to hold down (especially when driving for a long time) by adding the RealTriggers it is far more comfortable to hold and never a risk of your fingers slipping off. This should be the way the controllers are designed as standard!
0385504225|1.0|How do you decipher boredom? You try by reading The Lost Symbol. Immense letdown from the fiftieth page on. Totally incredible (as in, unbelievable) plot that actually snubs the reader's intelligence in favor of \\"oh my God\\" storytelling. Characters: annoying at best, one dimensional at worst. A hero in dire need of characteristics: Langdon's not merely an anti-hero, he's an anti-character...a dull, faceless \\"professor\\" who barely participates in the action and worse yet, appears \\"dumber\\" here than in the two previous novels. Surely, by the third book in a series, we should all come to know and \\"love\\" Langdon. But he's even more listless here than he was in Da Vinci Code (compare to Angels & Demons, where we truly get the sense he knows his stuff!). A villain with no surprise to him. Background characters that serve no purpose, even when they are part of the action. Situations that not only challenge the reader's willful sense of suspended disbelief, but challenge the notion Brown can write at all. This is a \\"Pro Tools\\" novel. A work forged with the barest of writing needed. One senses this is a skeleton of a much bigger work that Brown needed time to write yet sadly didn't have. Finally, the pacing and structuring is dreadful and uncaptivating. Plot devices (especially flashbacks) enter and exit at the most inopportune moments and in clumsy fashion. And that ending is one bona fide stinkeroo! I really enjoyed Angels & Demons and  liked Da Vinci Code. This one however, is far from the pinnacle of the pyramid. Hollywood & Mr. Hanks take heed: ingore and be better off for it. Film this one at your own peril.
0385504225|3.0|I really wanted to like this book, The Lost Symbol, because I enjoyed the first book of his I read, The Da Vinci Code, and I also enjoyed the Da Vince Code Movie. I also read Angels & Demons and saw the movie, but I liked \\"Angels\\" less (I know he wrote Angels before Da Vinci). I didn't even finish The Lost Symbol. The last few chapters were rambling filler and I just got bored to tears with it. All three Brown novels have unbelievable aspects to them that are just unnecessary and take away from the story. For example, in Angels, Langdon jumps out of a helicopter and glides down to earth with the helicopter's sunscreen as a parachute(!)....talk about \\"Jumping the Shark\\". Note in the movie this was changed. In The Lost Symbol, Brown \\"Jumped the Shark\\" when the character Peter Solomon, rescued after having had his hand chopped off and then tortured to reveal \\"secrets\\", nonchalantly chatters away about the Masons without a second thought about his trauma. The only reference to his injuries is a suggestion that he should probably go to the hospital at some point. Well, yeah, maybe so. I suppose I'll see the movie when it comes out, as it surely will, but it'll take a VERY good screenwriter to make a decent movie out of the book.
B002M2N9JI|5.0|I cannot stop listening to this album. I am crazy about La Roux! A friend told me to check out the track \\"Bulletproof\\" and I have been hooked since then. There are only a couple of tracks that I don't really listen to and that is very rare for me. Very heavy on the 80s instrumentals and Elly Jackson's voice is incredible. Probably my favorite song is \\"Going in for the Kill\\". I'm also very fond of \\"Colorless Color, \\"I'm not Your Toy\\", \\"Reflections are Protection\\" and of course \\"Bulletproof\\". I haven't found an album that I've liked this much in years. These are songs that I don't mind getting stuck in my head.
1594201927|5.0|Bought this book after watching the TV serial on the same subject. This is a great read with an intersting perspective on history. Pleasantly written and fast moving without an over-burden of detail.  Really is quite a fasinating story of our forefathers attempting to make a motza threaded through the histories of commerce, exploration, industrialization and war.
B002C6K7NA|5.0|I've listened to this album a couple times now, and each song is solid.  Some great rock n roll, jammin' guitar solos, and lyrics to which I can relate.  The entire CD has great sound quality and is meant to be cranked up loud!  Can't wait to see them at the Beacon in a couple days.
B000E1155E|1.0|Yeah, just like many of you, bought this album based on reviews and all the gloat from the critics.  I actually bought this album because it looked like people who like radiohead, interpol, arcade fire, and the likes, liked them too.  I listened to this album about 20 times and it just isn't for me.  I mean, I don't like anything about it, it actually irritates the [...]<br /><br />I feel for the same thing with them, and would give their first album away if anyone wants it.  What I'm beginning to realize, is that just like movie-goers, in the broadest terms, there must be two types of people who listen to and buy music: those who haven't been exposed and don't care to truly be exposed to great music, and those who have been exposed and now can't go back.  Something like the Matrix (sorry for the over used metaphor).  I understand music is subjective, but this isn't it, I mean, I can listen to some other bands who I don't particularly like, but I can understand why people would like them (black eyed peas, Coldplay, etc.), but then there are certain bands like this, who literally are crap compared to other bands in this genre or category, or taste.  [....]<br /><br />Based off of how many people enjoy this album and their new album, I don't want to say you won't like it, but if you have been exposed to amazing music... bands that have a soul and genius then you'll probably find this music lifeless and annoying as well.  If you haven't and you think Franz Ferdananz is awesome, then for reasons beyond me, you'll probably love these guys.
B002JM1VJG|1.0|In this time of advanced DVD technology and Hi-Def, how can Warner release this piss poor transfers of Madonna Videos.  This was highly anticipated and Warner dropped the ball.  Why do studios keep doing this.  Punish them by not buying this version and make them do it correctly.  People work to hard to make money, Warner should respect their customers and do it right the first time.  Send them a message and DON'T BUY.
0385504225|1.0|Listened to the unabridged audio book, and I found this book to be the worst of the three Langdon adventures. There is no \\"romance\\" to the adventure. In the previous books, Langdon was in awe and in love with the discoveries. In this book, he is so skeptical, that even when the proof was right in front of him, after TWO adventures of biblical proportions, he still found it impossible to believe.<br /><br />Also, the book was waaaaaaay too bloated and ridiculous. Especially the end. After the threat is isolated, the epilogue is a further 6 or 7 chapters and ENDLESS psuedo-science blah. Characters who SHOULD be seeking medical and psychiatric help are instead delivering lectures on the nature of god.  Very unrealistic.<br /><br />And a final point, the main villain is insanely 1 dimensional and cliche. Dan Brown borrows heavily from Tom Harris's Francis Dolarhyde character in Red Dragon, and is just as underdeveloped as the albino monk and the muslim assassin in the previous Langdon books.
B001DHXT20|4.0|Well, it certainly took me a while to get to this one and I think part of my reluctance stemmed from the 2003 film Hulk, which left me with mixed emotions.  The story was entirely too dry and drawn out for my tastes and what little screen time the title character received had more in common with video game graphics of the era then big-budget Hollywood feature films.  However, I did say mixed emotions on account of the fact that Eric Bana's interpretation of the Bruce Banner character was pretty solid and as poorly animated as they were, a few of Hulk's frenzies were the stuff of comic fan-boy dreams (traveling from town to town like a bouncing ball and tossing tanks as if they were a shot-put to mention a few).<br /><br />Enter The Incredible Hulk where five years of hiatus brought with them a new director, new script, and even a new leading male to pick up the torch as everyone's favorite \\"green machine\\".  It should be noted that to a majority of industry insiders, this film is not considered a direct sequel to the 2003 Hulk, but calling it an entirely independent tale isn't accurate either.  As such this work is what's commonly classified as a \\"loose sequel\\" and for the most part, succeeds in nearly every area where the original came up short.<br /><br />The film opens right where the former title left off with an apprehensive Banner trying to establish a new life for himself in South America after his last violent encounter with the military.  Working at a soda-bottling factory in Rocinha while searching for a cure for his condition, Banner is constantly at odds with his own biology as he practices calming techniques to control his heart rate with trained masters.<br /><br />Perhaps the coolest developed link-up in recent action-film history occurs when a drop of Banner's infected blood finds its way onto the glass of one of the soda bottles on the assembly line, ends up getting shipped to the States, finds its way into a Wisconsin resident's fridge, poisons the poor thirsty fool (played by none other than Stan Lee himself), and results in the government getting the trace on the scientist/ monster at-large.<br /><br />Without breaking down the plot too thoroughly (after all, why bother watching it if so), let's just say that the military wants what fuels Banner, Banner just wants to rid himself of the condition, Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Ross wants closure on her ex-boyfriend's condition, and rogue soldier Emil Blonsky feels like if given the chance, he could better-control the powers bestowed upon Banner.<br /><br />Where the 2003 film was a slightly misguided stab at drama, the 2008 picture is all action; bordering on the definition of a \\"popcorn flick\\".  As such the pacing is much more swift and efficient throughout with perhaps the longest non-action segment occurs right in the opening where Banner's attempt at a normal life in Brazil is established.  By the time Uncle Sam sends his goons down to retrieve the fugitive Banner, the viewer has passed the point of no return: hold on and enjoy the ride!<br /><br />Directed by Frenchman Louis Leterrier and written by Zack Penn opposed to Ang Lee and James Schamus respectively, the production team is only a part of the switch-ups Marvel Studious/ Universal Pictures implemented between Hulk and The Incredible Hulk.  Edward Norton replaces Eric Bana as Bruce Banner; Liv Tyler plays Betty Ross instead of Jennifer Connelly; and William Hurt takes over for Sam Elliott as General Thaddeus Ross.  And what would a Hulk film be without paying homage to the living legend Lou Ferrigno?  Lou delivers with both a cameo appearance as well as having provided the few spoken lines the Hulk delivers.<br /><br />Particularly noteworthy is the addition of a new villain intended to pose a more realistic threat to the Hulk than the military could possibly offer in the form of \\"The Abomination\\".  The presentation of this enemy is a bit reminiscent of the Gray Hulk Marvel comic story thread (only on the opposite side of the coin) and upon completing some research, it turns out that screenwriter James Schamus was indeed planning a sequel around the time the 2003 film was released that would indeed feature the Gray Hulk story arc.  However as time went on (and a new crew was assembled to do the film), Silver Age villain Abomination was recruited to provide the antihero moments with an updated look that subconsciously pays homage to the \\"Baby\\" alien design of Alien Resurrection.<br /><br />Perhaps my own crowning moment takes place at the conclusion of the film when Robert Downy Jr. appears as Tony Stark to assure a drunken General Ross that a new team of heroes was on the cusp of formation, of course hinting toward Marvel's next major motion picture: The Avengers set to release in 2012.  Additionally, and also appreciated by fans who have followed the comic's continuity, Samuel Sterns (played by Tim Blake Nelson) makes an appearance which sets up his eventual transformation from slightly mad scientist to green-skinned, large brained, massive skulled, super-intelligent villain, The Leader.<br /><br />In all it's easy to become thrilled with this project simply for the potential for future franchise efforts hinted toward throughout if not for the much-publicized improvements made over the 2003 picture.  And this coming from a reviewer who thought the 2003 film wasn't all that bad to start with.  While the computer generated imaging has drawn criticism by some fans once again, the truth of the matter is that this incarnation of the Hulk is truly \\"larger than life\\" as the character need be portrayed.  For the most part, it works, especially in the battle between Hulk and Abomination throughout the cityscape that comes off as a clash of titanic proportion more at home in the mythology of the ancient Greeks than on the pages of a comic book.  And in the end that's what makes for a solid comic to cinema translation as far as I'm concerned., it turns out that screenwriter James Schamus was indeed planning a sequel around the time the 2003 film was released that would indeed feature the Gray Hulk story arc.

B000B5XOSO|5.0|Burton's sequel is as good as the first but darker. Amazing how people complain that this film was too dark (so dark that due to protest from parents, McDonald's pulled out of a Happy Meal promotion for it). But nowadays, we commend the very dark aspects of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Both of which don't even have a sense of humor about them while this does, though dark. Returns is not a movie that I would let the kids watch (if I had any, but I'd let them watch it over any piece of garbage that Disney puts out or these very low-class comedies), as this, the first film and the two newer ones show that Batman isn't a film meant for the whole family like the Marvel films (except Punisher) or the Superman films. There were complaints of Batman killing people (the Strongman imparticular) but if people knew the history of the character, they'd know that Batman killed quite a lot back in the day. But enough of that rant. Keaton is again excellent as Batman and also gets a little more screen time as Bruce. Danny DeVito, to me, seemed an odd choice for the Penguin but for this interpretation, it fits him. I actually like his version and I don't think its a disturbing portrayal. People cry out for a serious interpretation of these characters over the campy 60s series and when they get a serious one, they complain because its too dark. Just a thought though; are the people of the city so stupid as to elect someone without any real political background to become mayor or does present day life really imitate art? Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman, though not my favorite, suits the mood of the film. She's out for revenge against the man who \\"killed\\" her and Batman but she feels attracted to him. The end scene between Catwoman and Batman is one of my favorites as she declines Bruce's offer, knowing her life is too screwed up to continue their relationship. And Christopher Walken again plays a good villain. He manipulates Penguin and (unknowingly) Catwoman for his own evil ends. My one complaint is that him getting the Penguin to run for mayor seems to be something that a DA, like Harvey Dent, would do instead of a business tycoon. In fact Dent was featured in many early drafts of the script and at the end would probably have become Two-Face, along with Shreck being the Penguin's older brother in earlier drafts. And Burton was attached to a Catwoman spin-off and Pfeiffer was supposed to return but after many years, the connection to this movie was lost and we got the horrible film with the equably horrible Halle Berry. Action wise it is one par with the first film. Danny Elfman returns with another solid score, making it quirky (for Penguin) and mysteriously sexy (for Catwoman). Unfortunately, due to the mixed reviews of this film and not doing as well as the first, Warners decided to not have Burton direct (resulting in the loss of Keaton) and go in a lighter direction (people can't make up their mind about how they want Batman portrayed; the tortured loner that the fans want or the family-friendly toy marketable blockbuster the studio wants).My one complaint is that him getting the Penguin to run for mayor seems to be something that a DA, like Harvey Dent, would do instead of a business tycoon.

B00008S2VG|5.0|I love Madonna and I needed a few replacement cd's. So I came on here and got some. The delivery time was awesomw, the cd plays perfectly!
B002GZQYMK|4.0|Some will love the new album instantly, others will have to grow into love with it...    I was one of the latter. But, now that I've listened to the whole album several times over, I can't turn it off.    I'm not a music guru, so I can't go in depth about the amazing arrangements of the new tracks (or lack there of in some points of view) or how it reflects old tracks to the trained ear.    I can only give you my point of view as an avid fan after having discovered their amazing music abou 4 years ago.    Resistance is a brand new direction. At first listen, I found myself thinking, \\"What now?\\" In past albums, I felt that the tracks flowed together side by side or into eachother seamlessly. That's almost not the case here.    Uprising, though very, very catchy, doesn't fit with the album. Actually, I don't know if I'd recognize it entirely as Muse if it weren't for Bellamy's vocals. And if I hadn't seen them preforming on the VMA's. But, it's a fantastic track on it's own.     The album kind of repeats this theme, the tracks are great on their own but don't make the album feel like a whole. Undisclosed Desires is another example of this. It's something quite different for them and it feels like an alternative take to R&B. It's something I could imagine Tabitha and Napoleon from So You Think You Can Dance trying to choreograph lyrical hip-hop to. No lie.     Tracks 6, 7, and 8 (Unnatural Selection, MK Ultra, I Belong to You...) are a little more reminscent of Muse's older works, I think. The guitar solo in track 6 is amazing. That's the section that made me want to fall in love with the album. I find myself closing my eyes and just letting the sound of it wash over me. It starts off kind of slow, but then picks up and I'm beating my hands against my car's steering wheel in rhythm.     And then the cresendo!!! Exogenisis Symphony Parts 1, 2, and 3. Brilliant. It feels like Muse. It sounds like a more theatrical take of their earlier work. I love part 1 and 3. I like part 2, but I'm a sucker for the piano arrangements in part 3. The whole track sounds like something that should be in a movie.    All in all, my opinion is that with this new album they decided to go in a more melodical direction. I don't quiet think melodical is a word, but that's the only thing I can think to describe the album as a whole.    If you're looking for something to head-bang or throw yourself into a mosh-pit to... this won't quite be it. Muse's previous albums will cover some of that pretty well. But, if you want something for a road trip, or something to listen to when you're working in you're art studio (like me), or when you're taking a stroll.... this will be something you can have on your ipod or any other mp3 player.     I wound up loving this album. And when you go back and listen to older tracks... like Knights of Cydonia, Hysteria, New Born, Plug in Baby, Map of the Problematique, Sing for Absolution... to name a few off the top of my head... you certainly notice similarities. I don't think they hit the nail on the head with what ever they were trying to accomplish, but there are a handful of good tracks on here.    And... that's my take.

0385504225|5.0|Who knew?  I am a native Washingtonian, as are my parents and grandparents - but never knew the inscription on the Washington Monument.  I worked on Capitol Hill for 15 years and never paid attention to the painting in the Capitol - or it's meaning.  This book is frightening, enlightening and fun.  I think the other reviewers have become so jaded at reading their own reviews and believing they are actual \\"critics\\" that they forget the object of reading is escape and fun.  This is a great book and worth the price of admission.
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|I liked it.  I've never seen seen any of the comics or the other movies in the series, so there were no pre-conceived notions.  Anyway, my husband is a big fan of the movies, so we watched it one cold rainy Saturday snuggled up in bed.  I expected to fall asleep ten minutes into it, (as I usually do), but stayed awake through to the end.  Since I fell asleep during: Octopussy, (at the drive-in), and The Empire Strikes Back (during its first run at the movie theater), and according to my hubby, more other films at home than he can count, you can figure that if a movie keeps my attention for the whole length, it's pretty good.
0525478183|5.0|The book arrived within a week and a half of purchasing. It's in great shape and I can't wait to read it.
1439102813|5.0|I had to read Lisa Genova's Still Alice twice.  The first time I was mesmerized by the story and wanted to find out how this accomplished and strong woman dealt with her surprise disease. The answer was very well.  Then I had to read it a second time to move slowly through the pages of this extremely well written and moving story so I could remember Alice and follow her journey once again.     This book is a real reminder of the fragility of our lives as we know it and a compassionate rendering of this heart-breaking disease. I think of Alice every time I see a butterfly ...
0385341008|1.0|Confusing, terrible book. It is comprised of only letters from one person to the next, which are boring and lifeless.<br /><br />We read this for a book club, and my friend who is in the book club with me took it with her today to read in the doctor's office waiting room. I told her that I would rather sit in the waiting room and stare at the wall than read that book.<br /><br />Thank goodness I got it at the library, or I would be searching for ways to get my money back.  :-(
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I cannot believe the bad reviews I am reading about this book.  For those with no sense of intrigue about the lost mysteries, the Knights Templar, King Solomon, the Free Masons, Lost Deities, Cults, Bible Beliefs,and Mysticism combined with modern science; this book is not for you.  Where is your sense of intrigue?  I, on the other hand, am fascinated with these subjects and constantly scour the History Chanel for programs pertaining to these subjects.  This is a fictional thriller.  Brown has woven a tale incorporating these mysteries.  I couldn't put it down.  Want to bet there will be a \\"Lost Symbol\\" tour in Washington?  Just as there is a \\"Angels and Demons Tour\\" in Italy.  OK, Tom Hanks we are ready for your next Robert Langdon episode.  Dan Brown - Kudos's to you for writing another great story.  Incidentally, right after finishing this book there was a show on the History Chanel called \\"Secrets of our Founding Fathers\\".  What a sequel to the book.  Just fascinating.

B002OD2HVQ|1.0|I bought this movie because I was interested in Salvador Dalí - the artist. The movie rambles through his early college years in a two hour fixation with a homosexual affair he may or may not have had with another student. Who cares! Dali ate sandwiches, cleaned his shoes, had lovers, sat on the toilet, just like we all do. but what was extraordinary about Dali is that he was also a brilliant painter and this movie basically avoids that aspect of his life altogether. It also barely touches on any of the eccentricities he was famous for. If this were a movie about Joe Bloggs who was a nice looking guy who fell in love with his mate then it would be an ok movie, but as a record of Dali's life it's plain terrible! If you love Robert Pattinson you may struggle through this, if you love Dali it will bore you to tears.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|This is possibly one of the best movies I've seen in a long time - I really appreciated the movie's theme. I think this is a movie I can watch every other month. (If it were every month then there would be less suspense because I'd know what's coming....).
0385504225|1.0|Sorry ... barely finished 3/4th of the book. i'm done. Is Langdon getting dumber day by day? Like all characters in this book i am 'amazed' too!<br /><br />waste of money and time.
1592400876|5.0|This wonderful little book had me laughing out loud.  It's not for everyone I suspect, but for those who always notice poor punctuation, whether it be in print or in advertising, it's nice to know there's someone else out there who gets crazy when they see it.  My copy now has many highlighted phrases.  It makes a great gift if you know someone else who had proper punctuation drilled into them in grammar school.
1400082773|1.0|Sadly, it now seems that Mr. Obama had the book ghost written by neighbor Bill Ayers.  Christopher Andersen's new book Barack and Michelle: Portrait of an American Marriage due out soon says that Michelle said when the deadline was approaching Barrack shipped his files and tapes out to Bill Ayers to write the book.    His creditability would have been enhanced by admitting this upfront just as many, many famous \\"authors\\" do.
0425206211|5.0|How can the novels of Lee Child get any better. His debut rocked and this, his 2nd novel was even better. \\"Trip Wire\\", Lee's third novel is on it's way, so I'm trying to finish another book before it arrives. I have too many authors to read, and as the saying goes \\"Too many books, too little time\\", however I will find the time to read all of Lee Child's books. Die Trying keeps you guessing what is next, and when you think you have it, he turns another corner. Jack Reacher is a great hero, a guy you would like to have as a friend, but would not want to cross him. Great, great read!!
B001FB55H6|5.0|When i heared the end of the movie was about to be changed i told me \\"another flick ruined by the producers !\\". What mistake it was ! The movie is the perfect translation of the graphic novel. Everything is great, the characterisation, the storytelling, the places... And i must tell the end is almost better than the original one. Who need squids ?  A great movie for the WATCHMEN fans, don't miss it !

B00007GZR5|5.0|This is one of my most favorite movies of all time.  When I first saw in the theaters, I had to see it again and again.  It touches on every aspect of passing over and all the different possiblities.  Now, years later, I can still watch it and see more of what life has taught me.  It actually prepared me for the loss of my son who died suddenly two years ago.
0375413405|1.0|I should have sent this back because there were sections that were askew and pages that were not cut properly.
B000BGH22W|5.0|The soundtrack to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has been my favorite of them all (so far). I don't know what took me so long to get this CD. I see the scenes in my head when I listen, of course I've seen the movie probably 50 times, but it's very vivid. Neville's Waltz, Harry in Winter, Death of Cedric and when I watch the movie and Another Year Ends is playing, I get very emotional. Music is very powerful and can make a strong connection to a movie. I will cherish all my HP movies forever and the music has so much to do with that. This composer nailed it, he has as much to do with the success of this film and anyone else involved. He has brought you in the moment.
B002M2N9JI|4.0|Am totally hooked on this fantastic synth-pop album - the songs sound oddly familiar and yet brand new... It's progressive in a throwback-to-the-80s kind of way.     Frontwoman Elly Jackson croons in her lilting falsetto like some space-age oddity, which works amazingly well in the opening track 'In for the Kill'.  Other gems like single 'Bulletproof', 'Quicksand' and 'I'm Not Your Toy' keep the party spirit up. Not a single dud track in this album.     This is what pop music should be - stock-full of irresistible hooks and beats, fun and not taking itself too seriously. They should collaborate with other 80s synth-pop giants like Pet Shop Boys, Human League or Erasure, like what contender Little Boots did in her duet with Philip Oakey off her debut \\"Hands\\", another delicious electro-synth offering.
0920668372|1.0|I can appreciate the message that this book is going for but the fact that it is so disturbing overshadows that by far. Not one of our favorites.
B002AT4K9G|5.0|I figured after the last movie that this one would be boring. It was everything except boring. It's wild and so much action. I loved this movie just as much as the others. Now I have the whole set and all are good to watch over and over. If you don't like action movies, don't buy this one.
0385504225|2.0|I rarely write reviews, but this book upset me so much I cant help it. It wasted my time, sucked away precious hours of my life. Why? Well lets talk about the implausability of the things in the book.    1. CIA Involvement: First of all, CIA has no jurisdiction in the United States under the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949. Why are they in this book???  Shouldnt it be the FBI or Secret Service if there is a threat to politicians?   1b. In any case, what are they even so worried about to chase Langdon and the maniac all around D.C for?   ***Spoiler***  Because he might reveal some politicians are masons? Who cares? That the do some weird rituals which dont actually harm anyone? WHY IS THIS IN THE BOOK OR A MAJOR PART OF THE PLOT?    2. Book drags on painfully towards the end - you want to just skim ahead to the ending...  3. The ending is the worst, anti-climactic ending I have ever read. I dont want to spoil it, but after reading to the end, you will hate Dan Brown for wasting your time and will want to ask him for your time and/or money back.     I read all his books, but this one is BY FAR the worst. STAY AWAY and save yourself some time read a better book or enjoy the outdoors.
0307278255|4.0|I normally don't love short stories, but I enjoyed Interpreter of Maladies and The Namesake, so I was looking forward to Unaccustomed Earth.  Overall, a decent collection of stories.  There were only a few that I didn't love (e.g. A Choice of Accommodations).      I have read the criticisms that Lahiri only writes about the same types of people, and that is true, but I do find that her stories still differ enough to keep me interested.  Although they might be the same 'type' of character, they are most definitely not the same characters.      And, her writing really does draw me in.  In context, the last line of this book - \\"We had been careful, and you had left nothing behind.\\" might be one of my favorite last lines out of any book I've read.
B0029LHW4U|4.0|I never thought I would see the day when an AIC album had Elton John on it instead of Layne Staley. Unless you've been living under a rock you know what Layne Staley died of an overdose a few years back and obviously can't be on the new AIC album. So a new AIC album is bittersweet for me. I'm glad to see the guys can carry on with something, especially Sean and Mike. Jerry has had his solo albums but the guys for the most part barring little projects like Spys4Darwin etc have been without a home. There are some standouts on the album. However all too much the songs seem to sound more like Jerry's solo stuff. They meander and just don't have that punch. Without Layne the songs just lack that bite. He was an integral part that made AIC work and made it what it was. I know the guys don't want to diminish his legacy or tarnish it in any way. And I think Duvall does a good job. You just have to realize when you buy this that it's not the same. Then you will enjoy it. If you're expecting AIC in it's prime you'll be dissapointed. Having said that, there are some good tracks and the acoustic ones are really well done. Overall a solid effort.
B002IYEQR4|1.0|like i said in the title, this is not cool or ethical and is the dark side of America in general.  this is what should have been out from day one of the dvd release but yet again they're trying to take advantage of the fans who really love an artistic masterpiece like Watchmen.  [...], i will continue to not be some simp (that's my friends' and my slang for simple minded person) who lets the money grubbing jerks trying to make people double dip succeed.  screw them.  don't be a simp!!!  on the other hand, if you haven't picked up Watchmen on dvd yet then i say go for it because this movie truly is a masterpiece and i would buy this if it wasn't for the double dip factor.  my 1 star is based on priciple and circumstance, NOT the amazing movie which deserves more than the 5 star maximum.
B001K98MFU|5.0|The Blu-Ray of this movie is awesome, they have fixed the mistakes of the orginal DVD version, and should be rated overall five stars, the problem, Amazon, has mixed the reviews from the old dvd with the blu ray, skewing the star results and reviews, Amazon, needs to keep the review for DVDs and Blu rays seperate, even if its the same movie the format is different an offers different things, and I would like to see reviews for the blu ray not the old dvd. If you agree Let your voices be heard..
B000BX4D0E|5.0|Be completely honest with me now- who would have ever guessed that a band that goes by the name Gong happens to be one of the coolest, most creative and refreshing rock bands of the 70's?  Gong is NO ordinary rock band.      Every time I tell someone about this wonderful band they think I'm referring to the 70's hit The Gong Show, haha.  I've never watched it, but I highly doubt this unique, drugged-out and diverse little rock band would have made an appearance on that show.    There's a bunch of ways to interpret the mid 70's incarnation of Gong.  One is that they rely on atmosphere above everything else that contains delicate female vocals and moody shifts in rhythm.  That's one way of interpreting them.  Another is that they sometimes offer a bit of silliness into their psychedelic-influenced sound that closely resembles something classic late 60's Frank Zappa would do.      Another is that Gong just likes to play goofy circus music.  Or maybe Gong is so unique because they actually play very professsional jazz?  Just LISTEN to any saxophone jam on this Flying Teapot album and try telling me it's not as good as something Miles Davis was doing at the time.  It IS just as good (all opinion of course).   The band can easily break out into a jazzy and melodic psychedelic saxophone or electric guitar jam at a drop of a hat and make it sound positively *awesome*.    All these things I'm mentioning are important, because all of these features can be found on Flying Teapot.      You see, there's a bunch of ways to listen to a band like Gong.  So much diversity, creativity, and uniqueness in their sound and style... and yet they've become a band that's slowly slipping away and becoming a distant memory.   How about taking my word for it that if you're ready to hear one of the craziest bands from the 70's, pick up a Gong album.  If not Flying Teapot, I believe You pretty much sums up this incredible band.  A band we're supposed to forget about in the year 2009-2010 just because it's been over 30 years since this music was released?  Ha, don't make me LAUGH!   Gong is absolutely great.

B002HNA95E|3.0|I got this compilation cd because I am a Madonna fan.  My only problem is that too many of the hits are the radio versions which are cut down or some of the songs, one in particular, Like A Virgin, is the version that was on The Immaculate Collection.  If Madonna or Warner Brothers are going to release something like this, TAKE THE SONG DIRECTLY FROM THE ORIGINAL CD that the song was release from.    Some songs were not touched, like Live To Tell. Same version as it was from the True Blue album. Crazy For You was cut even shorter on this album than the version on Madonna's Something To Remember cd. What's up with that??   Maybe I am being too picky but I love the original versions as they were done on the original album. Not mixes meant for the radio.  Maybe they will release a box set somewhere down the road and the Powers That Be will not touch the original master tapes.
B000IY03DM|5.0|I love Il Divo. The harmony is fantastic.  I really can't give adequate details because it's so amazing.  Anyone who loves classic music, arias, will love this group.  All their CD are amazing.
B001R7IHA0|4.0|This CD is definitely worth buying.  The singles are great, but there are a lot of other songs worthy of a listen.
B00012FXB8|4.0|I remember seeing this at the age of 8 peeking through my fingers. I had a love of the first 2 since i was old enough to understand them (5 or 6). I had Alien toys and made my own dropship out of those large plastic building blocks. Alien and Predator are very dear to me. and terminator and robocop too. I remember begging my mom to let me get the queen alien (i got it).     Alien 3 is to some one of the worst Alien films but to me and i'm sure others it is gold. I think the crew was trying to recreate the claustrophobic atmosphere from alien. To that end it was succesful. I was kinda peeved about Hicks , Bishop, And Newt's fates as a kid but now as I see it as an adult  i see what the crew wanted.  alien 3 was supposed to be the end of the cycle. In Alien the creature killed ripley's crew in Aliens ripley repayed the creatures. Ripley is not onoly the last survivor or the Nostromo but the Sulaco as well, she's a survivor and the last of her kind, as is the alien in here. The aliens honored her with a queen embryo. The creatures and her are closer than ever ( Ripley clone aside). They won't kill her because of what she has and this makes her able to see them closer. The prison is full of repentant crimals who sacrifice themselves to destroy this evil. The corp wants it to bring in a new era of bio-weapons.  good and evil , peanut butter and jelly. Who will survive?    All in all if you haven't seen this in a while give it another shot especially as an alien fan.It is in my opinion the 3rd best in the series. Alien Resurrection was always to me a side story and the clone isn;t really the Lt. Ellen Ripley we knew but a hellish amalgam of Ripley and her sworn enemies.     Now a lot of you say that there are quenstions unanswered in the film series and that is true. A lot of people were peeved at the loss of Hicks, and the other survivors of the Sulaco. What's with the space jockey? If you are looking for these answers pick up a copy of Aliens Omnibus #1 from dark horsecomics. while they may not be canon you can look at it as what would of happened if alien 3 never happened or if you just don't like and accept Alien 3. Hicks and Newt are alive, they go to the alien's homeworld, a live space jockey shows up ( a friend of the dead one in Alien), earth gets overrun with aliens and Ripley Lives!!!     Rock and Roll!!!!
0385504225|3.0|Oh, where to begin? Pseudo-science, God, fanaticism. Sound familiar? It starts out promisingly enough but the scientific overload, hackneyed dialogue, ubiquitous sadistic/masochistic bad guy had me yelling \\"Enough, already\\" and wishing the denouement would arrive more quickly. It's not Angels and Demons, which I found to be a superior tale to The DaVinci Code. What can I say? I was not a big fan.

B001ILHY2C|4.0|Paul W.S. Anderson (Event Horizon, Alien vs. Predator, Resident Evil) directs \\"Death Race\\", which is a remake of the Roger Corman film, \\"Death Race 2000\\". This movie, however, is set in the year 2012 when American society is supposedly collapsing and regressing into a barbaric age where prisoners are used for a spectacle car race in a revival of the gladiators and chariot races from the days of the Roman coliseum combats around 80A.D.<br /><br /> Jason Statham has been set up for the murder of his wife and ends up in a penitentiary full of hardened criminals where he is procured as the replacement for a recently killed racer, named Frankenstein, whose face was so badly scarred that he wore a metal mask and hence his name. Paul W.S. Anderson has directed other sci-fi movies, notably the Resident Evil movies, Event Horizon, and Alien vs. Predator. Here again he uses his considerable skills as a director to deliver this tongue in cheek thrill ride. Joan Allen also stars as the evil jail house warden whose only interest is in the ratings of the death race TV show and the money garnered from the death races. What's not to like in this entertaining spectacle which is spiced up with the sexy Natalie Martinez as Statham's assistant navigator, and the gloriously metallic music supplied by Paul Haslinger?<br /><br />The blu-ray comes with the theatrical and unrated versions of the movie. I think I actually prefer the theatrical version a bit better just because the ended is concluded in the rapid fire manner of the rest of the film, whereas I find the unrated version drags the ending out a bit in comparison. All in all this is one riotous film.
0156421178|5.0|(A parody of yet another of Famous Archie Rice's music hall hits.)  Others might call it PUT ME IN THE POUM -- Partry of Marxist Unification (or POUM) -- but I would discourage festivities on the grounds of toxic irony.  Besides, in this conflict I would much prefer to be back at the Hotel with Orwell's wife, drinking tea and listening to her tell me what kind of man he was, and why she accompanied him to Barcelona while this thing was brewing.  \\"Well, you see,\\" she might begin, \\"there was something going on, you know.  'Said it might turn into some sort of war.  An' he 'ad to 'ave 'is story, like.  An' I 'adn't been to Spain, I 'adn't.  But who'd 'ave thought it to be so cold?\\"<br /><br />Me, well one of the things I didn't like about Orwell's Spain and the POUM in particular was that their mascot, a dog, was branded -- yes, branded -- with the letters P O U M burnt large on his hide.  Makes you wonder:  Who would brand a dog?  Socialism's not for them, I suspect.  But then, of course, what would you expect in a country which has as its great entertainment, the ritual public torture and killig of cattle?<br /><br />But this book does not flinch.  This is a great documentary of the Spanish Civil war because this man went there only intending to watch, but joined in mostly without thinking, and kept notes throughout.  (Got 'imself seriously wounded too, for 'is trouble.)  Shortly after leaving Spain he transcribed those notes into the book before you.<br /><br />NOTE:  Days later, after reading and reviewing this book I began reading it again very carefully, to check my first impression, and CATALONIA seems to me an even better book than I thought originally.  That Orwell participates in the action and maintains his objectivity is phenomenal.  It is impossible to imagine Hemmingway with all his vainglory, doing anything comparable.  Some say Orwell was a great writer, some say he wasn't, but he himself wouldn't have wasted any time on that.  You can't call Orwell a stylist, precisely.  What you find when you read his work, is a sincere man writing in good English, without tricks.<br /><br />\\"It is difficullt to be certain about anything except what you have seen with your own eyes, and consciously or uconsciously everyone writes as a partisan.  In case I have not said this somewhere earlier in the book I will say it now; betware of my partisanship, my mistakes of fact and the distortion inevitably caused by my having seen only one corner of events.\\"<br /><br />He has the skill his education gave him, but the remainder derives from the decency of his character.  Orwell was a disciplined writer with high principles who never blew smoke up anybody's dress.<br /><br />Re-reading now, I came to realize suddenly that I read this book long ago; probably in High School, and either skipped over his description of the political causes of the war, or read them and simply didn't understand them.  Now I understand:  The Trotskyites were only those individuals who sought to practice that kind of humanist social collectivism he espoused when he was one of the Party's leading thinkers and writers; in other words, the true Revolutionaries.  The Spanish Communists were comitted to a universalist totalitarian collective throughout Europe, directed from Moscow by Stalin.  The later collaborated with the Spanish Fascists to eat the Trotsky-Socialists.  It was typical of the brief Nazi-Soviet alliance that devoured Poland.  (Stalin had Trotsky assassinated, later.)  Soon, Franco, copying Napoleon's tactics, would sweep over Spain with his own mercenary army of North Africans, and devour the Spanish Comunists too.<br /><br />I recommend the book not because of its political posture -- whatever that may be (Orwell was Labor.  What does that mean today?) -- for Orwell has no propaganda angle.  Does he?  Or does he?  You have to figure it out for yourself.hat you find when you read his work, is a sincere man writing in good English, without tricks.      \\"It is difficullt to be certain about anything except what you have seen with your own eyes, and consciously or uconsciously everyone writes as a partisan.

B00006DEF9|5.0|Unlike many other movies that top various best of lists, I absolytley agree that Singin in the Rain deserves to be tops in many great musical lists.  There's something that makes Singin in the rain a magical experience, especially when it's stacked against the competition of musicals that threaten it's reputation.  Maybe musicals aren't my thing, but most songs are slow, drawn out, boring, and the same thing over and over again in most musicals.  Singin in the Rain is fast paced, sometimes implausable and plot hole-ridden (Who the hell conveices an idea like Cosmo and Don did to the RF?), but when your laughing at Lina's hideous vioce (I tend to go Mystery Science Theater 3000 and insult and answer her questions), feeling the rhythmic tap dancing, being hilarious entertained by the humor of it all, or just simple indulging in the movies extreme energy and charisma, who the ______ cares?  I sure don't, which is one reason why I enjoy this knockout movie quite the bit.<br /><br />MUSICAL NUMBERS (Music, dancing) 19/20<br /><br />There are only two things wrong with the music.  You Are My Lucky Star's great background music is utterly destroyed by the HORRIFYING lyrics, and You Were Meant For Me is saved by it's instrumental passage (the music is great beneath it, but the lyrics are pretty lame).  That's it.  Every other musical number is a knockout, and there is no filler of any kind.  Instrumentally, it recalls the glory days of those HOllywood numbers, as the background music is jazzy, upbeat, absolutely happy but never annoying or childish.  I also do love the score in the background as well, as it's also terrific.<br /><br />And as for the dancing, it's not the most brilliant or technically hard thing ever, but the performances never get old, with a lot of different styles besides tap.  Fred Astaire may have been graceful, but Gene Kelly had the energy.  Oh, and did you know he performed his famous number with a 103 degree fever?  Donald O' Conner follows suite, and this guy could even do a wall flip without wires.  Cyd Charisse's dancing is seductive and brilliant, and Debbie Reynolds, well, learned fast.  Everyone is a complete joy to watch, so let's just leave it at that.<br /><br />ART DIRECTION 10/10<br /><br />Keeping true to the fantasty Hollywood, I really can't help but love the look of this film.  They made great care to make the 20's Hollywood fully envisioned; Gene Kelly even looked at photographs at length to nail down the look.  I don't make a big deal about things such as costumes, but I think most of the costumes are great to look at.  Even if they aren't my taste (among then include the Dueling Cavalier costumes.  Somtimes things are better off being outdated), it still adds to the movie anyway.  Besides, it's what they wore back then, it's supposed to be depicing that time.  Even so, plenty of them look cool, so I guess it works.<br /><br />What I do love more is the architecture and interior design, which is much more my thing to look at.  I love all of the designs, and I also think the Broadway look was nailed as well, entirely painted like a dark room ride almost.  There's even some slick visual tricks in the midst, but that's really not the main focus of it.  It's just a great looking movie.<br /><br />CHARACTERS AND ACTING 18/20<br /><br />All the stars of the movie bring prescene, and as a consequence, the actors and actresses that play their perspective parts will never leave my mind.  For now one, Gene Kelly will always be Don Lockwood, and every other part will be Gene Kelly as \\"(insert role here)\\".  He's a great dancer and did much more than this, but this is the most memorable part he has ever done.  It goes for everybody else as well.<br /><br />As for the chracters, they aren't typically unique, but all of them memorable.  Jean Hagen will always be known as the lady with the most grating voice of all kind, and it's generally a funny movie.  Cyd Charisse makes a great appearance as the seductivegangster's girlfriend in the Broadway section, and it's easily one of the most memorable regarding females, a sort of sleazy girl who a flair for being dangerous and attractive at the same time.  Needless to say, while you won't learn anything from these characters, you certainly will love them all.<br /><br />STORY AND DIALOGUE 18/20<br /><br />The Story is another thing that makes this movie highly enjoyable.  While tons musicals contain an overblown romantic story, Singin' In the Rain's love story (done with subtley, thank god) takes a back seat to themes about deception of words, and the fact that the movie is largely about the film industry itself.  As everybody knows, the movie offers a comedic take on the bumpy road from silents from talkies.  The ending may be a bit predictable, but who cares?  The way is filled with a great script, memorable moments, great songs, and art direction.  There's hardly a dull moment in the whole thing.<br /><br />The dialogue is generally funny and always great, and features great lines, dry humor, and observations about the silent film era, and the acting of the time.  This is a very quotable movie despite the fact you will probably look like an uncool twit (verses saying the latest line from the Judd Apatow involded comedy movies that everybody loves).  Either way, highly highly memorable.<br /><br />This movie is the kind of movie that makes my day better at times, almost so if I have had my Grande Latte Enema and it hasn't even worn out.  if people think I'm too happy or something, _____ em'.  Heh, jokes on them if they know me (do you tend to notice that once you get know people, you sometimes like them less and less as much as you like them more and more?).  Singin' In the Rain is one of the very few things that I love that are happy and heartwarming, unlike many, many other forms of media (*cough* Titanc *cough*)that make me feel absolutely nothing.  This is a gem of a movie, and while it isn't perfect, nothing quite comes close to it.  The Citizen Kane of musicals?  Maybe, only it's actually deserving of it's place on the polls.he most memorable regarding females, a sort of sleazy girl who a flair for being dangerous and attractive at the same time.

B0024FAR5M|5.0|To keep this as short as possible without giving anything away about the show, I initially thought this one would be a failure (which is rare for FX network).  I remember seeing the commercials hyping up the first season and it really didn't seem like more than a biker gang committing crime, which is what most would expect.    A couple of episodes into the first season I was hooked.  Yes, it is about a club of Bikers committing crime, but it goes deeper than that.  It shows the more human side to the club members while we watch them try to balance their morals on one hand and their crime-driven livelihood on the other.  Violence with rival gangs, dirty cops, clean cops, betrayal between club members, and more than a fair share of hilarious moments to balance it all out.  This show's got it all.  My recommendation is watch at least a couple of episodes and then decide what you think, but keep in mind that the more you watch, the better the show gets.
B00004XPPE|5.0|I've never cared for [[ASIN:B000055Y0X DR. STRANGELOVE]] (1964), and Sidney Lumet's FAIL-SAFE is precisely the reason why. FAIL-SAFE is THE Cold War masterpiece, while its predecessor is a clumsy, unamusing and ill-advised Stanley Kubrick work. The chance of nuclear annihilation really exists and is not something to make light of.<br /><br />In FAIL-SAFE, Henry Fonda is brilliant as President of the United States and Larry Hagman in only his second motion picture is equally superb. It's Hagman's job to interpret what the Soviet premier says to Fonda over the hotline as a group of American bombers with multiple 20 megaton bombs heads towards Moscow, but he must also give impressions of the Russian's feelings and intentions. It's grueling work, and knowing that humanity may be on the brink of extinction is clearly delineated by Hagman, who should've won a Supporting Actor Oscar for his efforts.<br /><br />In fact, this remarkable drama did not receive a SINGLE Oscar nod.<br /><br />Near story's end, tension and fear have built to the breaking point, then after an extended agony of suspense, Bang Bang Bang, like a champion boxer landing a trio of rapid-fire blows, events unfold one-two-three and everything ends in utter tragedy. The absolutely avoidable, unthinkable, impossible happens and following one final brilliant bit of quick multiple edits in a 20 second space, the screen goes black.<br /><br />I was too young to see FAIL-SAFE at a theater, but can easily imagine the effect this ending had on audiences, for it honestly left me stunned. The contemplation of such horrific possibilities especially in these most hazardous times is enervating, sobering, depressing.<br /><br />So if I have nothing but disdain for DR. STRANGELOVE, now you know WHY.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(8.0) Fail-Safe (1964) - Henry Fonda/Larry Hagman/Dan O'Herlihy/Walter Matthau/Fritz Weaver/Frank Overton/Sorrell Booke/Dom DeLuiseuise

I wouldnt recommend spending your $10 on this book..Stay away..

B002JM1VJG|1.0|It is such an insult to Madonna for WB to release such a crap!! Does anyone realize that Celebration DVD is almost the entire Madonna's body of work that was released for the first time in her entire career? Imagine the hundreds and thousands of creative hours that went into these videos, not only from Madonna herself, but from everyone, the top directors, stylist, lighting specialists... and the list goes on. There is no excuse for the poor quality; some forgiving fans may accept it as there is no other choice. We are at a high tech age when we should be looking at top quality images and sound; why the quest for scientists to invent one format after another so that work of art can be perceived in the highest level for the senses, as close to live as possible; I am not impressed by poor quality movies that are passed as \\"artistic\\". I have recently watched a restored version of the multi Academy Award winning movie The Last Emperor on the blu-ray, it was a brand new experience even though the movie was made 22 years ago!!! it is like the movie was made yesterday with crystal clear image and perfect sound quality, especially the music soundtrack. My point is that we can, I think we should be able to, watch Madonna's masterpieces again at a much higher level of enjoyment, at least we should be given a choice. It is OK if we choose to watch her videos on a 32\\" TV, but it should also be good for a home theatre on a 100\\" screen. What is the point of having the video collection on DVD when we can get the same or better quality from TV, which I think many ardent fans would have recorded on their DVD recorders already, and mostly uncensored. We fans should all get together and make a petition to WB to get their act together to do a proper release, even on 3 DVDs if needed, even on blu-ray not not so much to ask for from Madonna as even Britney, along with a whole lot of others, has their videos on blu-ray already. I do wish that Japan will re-master the DVD themselves, theyalways do and they pay a lot of attention to quality. Someone in WB should be fried for this!!!!
B002HNA95E|5.0|With the release of CELEBRATION...this will mark MADONNA's 4th collection of greatest hits; The Immaculate Collection (1990), Something To Remember (1995) and GHV2 (2005).  Unlike the other packages - this is the most definitive collection of the most memorable pop songs of the last 2.5 decades - not too mention the accompanying dvd - with some of the most talked about videos of the past 2 decades:  LIKE A VIRGIN (the song that made Madonna a household name) whether you liked her or not - this video was a staple in MADONNA's video career.  There are other controversial videos such as; LIKE A PRAYER, EROTICA, JUSTIFY MY LOVE, VOGUE, SECRET and MUSIC (a little disappointed that Warner didn't include the uncensored version of the AMERICAN LIFE video), WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL and many others never before on dvd.  There is no other artist that has had such an impact on pop culture and that has made such a huge contribution to video besides Michael Jackson.    Madonna remains relevant and is the mother of re-invention.  She has brought underground dance music and introduced it to the masses as 'pop' music.  She made voguing mainstream, she was not shy to sing and make videos about sexual fantasies, she dabbled in R&B and had her biggest # 1 single \\"Take A Bow\\" which remained # 1 on the Billboard HOT 100 Chart for 7 weeks, she gave us Music, Ray of Light and the much under-rated masterpiece that is AMERICAN LIFE.      Madonna is THE QUEEN OF POP and this collection is confirmation of all the amazing, controversial, innovative and still relevant music/video she has made and will continue to make.    If you have waited to get your hands on MADONNA's greatest singles - WAIT NO LONGER.  This is a must have for old and new fans alike.  Go get a copy and dance in CELEBRATION![[ASIN:B002JM1VJG Celebration: The Video Collection]]
0743270754|5.0|Even though I have not finished reading this book, so far it is what I expected from this author.  Everything she writes is very good and easy to read.  It is not just a list of facts, but a story behind the characters.  You learn more than what you read in history books.  Highly recommended.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|Well going astray from the previous three albums which were released just over two years apart from each other, we've had to wait well over three years this time for Breaking Benjamin's fourth piece of work. But, was it worth the wait?    After hearing the first single \\"I will Not Bow\\", I knew immediately I was going to like where Ben Burnley and the other boys were gonna take us; not only does this song fit the mold and profile for a BB song, but it's something new and different, yet still has that ring that will suck you in the more you listen to it. First single: check. Entire album...?    From start to finish, there's a noticable difference to Dear Agony from Phobia - no breaks! From the first strum and riff on \\"Fade Away\\", to the very last violin and cello note on \\"Without You\\", this album does not stop! Now, not to say Phobia was bad, because it's still one of my favorite albums of all-time. It just has a different fill with some slower parts to it, that's all. However, that just proves that Breaking Benjamin knows how to change the way they write, and let it evolve into something new and different.    Like all albums, there are definately highlights. Dear Agony does just that with such songs as \\"Fade Away\\", \\"I Will Not Bow\\", \\"Crawl\\", \\"Give My a Sign\\", \\"What Lies Beneath\\", \\"Anthem of the Angels\\", \\"Dear Agony\\" and \\"Without You\\"... pratically the entire album! But let me just say that the others are anything but fillers; the first listen to them just doesn't bite AS hard as these others, that's it.    So as a whole, Dear Agony is an amazing album - definately a years best. The guys from Wilkes-Barre have yet to disappoint, and this, another amazing album, proves that.
B002IVLH6U|5.0|A quick note -    *this album is available for purchase at a regular price at any Target location.  *this album is available for download at a regular price on itunes.  *this album is also available for purchase at any locally-owned record/cd store.    Otherwise you will have to pay the expensive price listed here because Target is the only big-box chain store which sells Backspacer in the United States.  Amazon must have fandangled a way to buy it from overseas and then resell it to you here, though that is just a guess.    On to the music.    It is wonderful.  The album is again produced by Brendan O'Brian.  As a whole the disc feels more upbeat than 2006's self-titled offering.  With that being said we still get plenty of Eddie's growl and plenty of songs that rock.  If you are already a fan of the band, you ought to stop reading this review and go purchase this now.  You will not be disappointed.    The songs on the album are as fresh and inspired as you would expect a new recording to be from a band as creative as Pearl Jam.  I feel that Binaural, Riot Act, and Pearl Jam are all excellent albums.  But Backspacer is the most 'fun' to listen to of that group.  The songs are tight, concise, and inventive.  I doubt anything on the album is much longer than four minutes.      I was pleasantly surprised Target had a supply of Backspacer available for purchase on vinyl, and that is what I bought.  The disc is nice and heavy, probably along the lines of 180 grams.  It doesn't seem quite as hefty as some of my 200 gram records.  Regardless, the sound quality is excellent.  This is about all I have to say.  I feel an album needs many years to really grow on me and allow me to accurately compare it alongside the material that came before it.  But I can easily give this recording a five-star rating, and recommend it heartily to Pearl Jam fans, and fans of good music in general.
B00288KNLS|4.0|The movie was very creative as is always the case with Tim Burton's work. It had a few slow parts but basically it held my interest from beginning to end.  The 3-D element was great!  I wish more DVDs would have this feature in their package options.  Sometimes after watching a movie, I don't care to see it again.  I definately will watch this one several times.
0060935464|4.0|Harper Lee's 1960 classic novel about life and racial prejudice in a small Mississippi town in the mid-Thirties proves vibrantly human and poignantly valid 50 years later.  Narrated by 6-8 year old Jean Louise Finch--who scorns the idea of becoming a lady--the story depicts a child's gradual awareness of racial tension and bigotry in the deep South. She and her older brother, Jem, experience the usual round of kids' fantasies and pranks, Us-against-Adults mentality in Part One, which serves as an extensive background for the dramatic and fatal confrontations in Part Two. With a visiting neighbor boy, Dill, the siblings are obsessed with luring out a reclusive man in a spooky house next door, Mr. Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley.      With deliberate casualness the author mentions an upcoming legal case whose Black defendant will be represented by Scout's quietly dignified father, Atticus. Over the ensuing months she becomes aware that the town and even her extended family are disgusted with the calm tenacity of this man of principle--who  has sunk so low as to be proud to defend a mere Black against a White (trash) family. Scout comes to admire her 50-year-old father for more than his patience and his cool marksmanship under duress.  She is amazed by his morality as both as a caring parent and as a trustworthy role model of a human being.  Alone against the entire white community Atticus commands respect in the packed courtroom and in the court of public opinion. An enduring read for all ages.
0385504225|2.0|Washington,DC is the location and the freemason's the mystery, interestingly he tells us a lot about both . The story is drawn out over a one day time, and it takes about 15 hours to read the book. The way the story is written is to much like the pass two, the same kind of characters, chase sequences , antagonist, a little plot twist at the end .There is a  long pro church speech at the end . It seams that brown is trying to get the churches approval for This one . The tour of Washington,DC was well researched, but other wise the book was a disappointment.
B002JM1VJG|2.0|Censorship bars in the Justify My Love and Erotica videos.  Overly compressed video to fit on single-layer discs instead of dual-layer.  No anamorphic formatting for the widescreen videos.  Looks crappy on a big TV.<br /><br />Shame on you, Madonna and Warner Brothers.

Madonna has made herself the most recognizable public figure on the face of the planet with her iconic charisma and her music.    \\"Celebration\\" is one of the best songs she has done in a long time and it gets me moving like no other Madonna song has ever done.    I LOVE MADONNA!!!! and this compilation is amazing!

0783226845|5.0|This one is a masterpiece. First of all because Al Pacino cuts a character he is in no way close to being in real life. He plays a retired lieutenant-colonel which is nothing, but a blind one. His blindness is the symbol, and result, of both a heroic career and a sad end because he was passed over for general. This mixture of so many emotions and feelings and frustrations is marvelously conveyed by the actor. His tone, his behavior, his general stand, his unpredictable reactions, his decision to leave this world and his second decision to stay can be read in the way he speaks, the words he uses, the expressions his blind face carries, his attitudes toward other people, etc. He is a millionaire in emotions. But it is a masterpiece for so many other reasons that I am only going to quote a few. First it is a journey, the journey of a prep school teenager, a student on a scholarship mind you, from Oregon to Cambridge, Massachusetts, then to New York, a round trip with the colonel he is taking care of for the Thanksgiving long week end. This journey, and particularly the lap to New York and the subsequent events, are an initiation. The young chap is to learn what principles are in life and that you have to stand by them, especially if you are poor and fragile in body and social status: then be strong in soul and mind and spirit. Your ethics are your only asset and power in life. He also has to learn how to understand his colonel companion and feel when he has decided to send him buy cigars while he is putting an end to his life and the gun loaded with his bullets are an impressive key to the solitary tower of growing up with death in front of you. He saves that man with a crazy idea of a ride, for a blind man, to drive a Ferrari in the Bronx or somewhere under the Brooklyn Bridge, and with all the frills of such a ride including the cop who catches him speeding but does not realize he is talking to a blind man. But this film is also a film about the elite education these Ivy League prep schools provide the young men of today with to prepare them to be the leaders of tomorrow. There I will not hint too much at that side of the story. Let's say an act of vandalism which is a student prank and nothing more, leads the headmaster into menacing the two student witnesses (our poor one and a rich kid) with the worst punishment going as far as trying to buy the cooperation of the poor student. The final disciplinary hearing is absurd in its logic. The three culprits go through because there is no clear cut witness, the rich one, with his father, pretends he did not have his contacts on but gives the three names with a maybe, and the poor one, Charlie by the way, refuses point blank to be a fink, a stool pigeon. And there the intervention of his would-be-and-could-have-been-suicidee colonel saves the day. That you will have to find out by yourself. In many ways it is a lot stronger than the Dead Poets Society and the drama is avoided. It is better because it is the vision of a poor scholarship student and not the vision of one rich kid, in recent society and not in the 1920s or so. The point of view makes it a lot more powerful about society and courage, even if less dramatic as for the relations between the rich kid and his father. The loser all along is the headmaster who did not know how to recognize a prank and over-estimated it into an act of vandalism. Yes that kind of repressive attitude produces soul cripples and there is no prosthesis for that type of amputation.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDIvy League prep schools provide the young men of today with to prepare them to be the leaders of tomorrow.

0385504225|4.0|The story is pretty good....lots of suspence and fun facts about Masons. But the stupidity of the main characters drove me nuts. Langton is so dumb when dealing with the bad guy. He has dealt with very evil people in other books, yet he appears like a newbie here...so innocent and trusting. Jeez! And Katherine Solomon isn't much better. I wanted to reach out and shake them....or punch some sense into them.
0143034901|5.0|This is the best read for me in the last 5 years. Carlos Ruiz Zafon's command of the Spanish language(I have not read it in english) is a delight in and of itself. A really intriguing story that keeps you hooked from beginning to end. I want to take off and fly to Barcelona tonight and try to look for the cementary of lost books. Wouldn't it be thrilling to find it? Zafon's use of imagination leaves the reader wanting more. I was sad to finish this great story.
B0000009S3|5.0|Fabulous album, Zappa and Ian Underwood go overdub mad on tracks laid down live-in-studio by incredible rhythm sections, using one of the first 16 track recorders.  The composing - both the underlying songs and the arrangements and layers and doublings that seem to have been created during overdubs - is amazing.  Combines great musicianship, balls to the wall playing and just a tiny touch of the arch sense of humor Zappa is known for.  A total classic.  My only criticism is that I prefer the mix from the old LP version.  The CD-era remix brings out the filligree of detail, which is nice, but lacks some of the warmth and grooviness of the LP.  The perfect Zappa album for jazzers and people who find his lyrics (tailored, by his own account, for 13 year old boys) ultimately tiresome.
B001FB55I0|4.0|The movie was good, a few bad lines, but mostly the editing was really off, they shouldn't have cut the time down to under 2 hours and made it a PG-13 flick.  That was a big mistake, that's like making Rambo a G-rated film, it's just not right.  Christian Bale is good as John Connor, he gives an alright performance, but he could have done a little better.  Anton Yelchin (Young Kyle Reese) did a superb job portraying the young hardened soldier who will eventually go back to protect young Sarah Connor, but not in this film.  The movie is good, but due to editing and script changes here and there, caused the movie's poor performance at the box office.  It's still a good film to watch, it gives us a fresh new look at the world post Judgment Day.  It's NO James Cameron film by a long shot, but still decent with good action.  Just don't expect to follow the plot as it has it's ups and downs by the different writers that wrote the screenplay.  Expect a future blu-ray/dvd Terminator Salvation: Extended Cut (I don't know what they will call it) to contain most of the deleted scenes 30-40 mins worth with the original ending and an alternate storyline to debut sometime in late 2010.  It's an alternate version of the film, much like Donner's Superman II cut.  This only has 3 mins added, with Moon Bloodgood's breasts and a couple of F-Bombs in this sad director's cut.
078322804X|5.0|A great memory of John Belushi. This is an excellent movie and one everyone should have in their collection, if not for Aykroyd and Belushi, for the crazy host of musicians that make an appearance, like Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles. Great buy.
0385342020|4.0|This book was pretty humorous at times and had more substance than I originally thought it would.  The twenties theme was refreshingly different and the ending was a bit surprising, in a good way.  The only thing that bothered me was that the bond between Lara and Sadie seemed a bit forced at times.  Lara flew from being selfish to selfless at such high speeds I couldn't decide if I actually liked her or not.  Cute quick read though.
0802136834|5.0|Overview:              Many books have been written about Henry VIII and his infamous marriages, but Alison Weir takes us back to the facts, guiding us through the events that led these women into the arms of this powerful man.            Beginning with Katherine of Aragon and ending with Catherine Parr, Weir expertly answers the Who, What, Where, How, and, most importantly, Why questions that form the real stories of these incredible women.       Review:            Wow! I usually abstain from non-fiction historical books, preferring instead to read historical fiction novels which reflect the importance of the story over dry, dull facts. But, this book was soo interesting that I felt like I was watching a movie instead of reading a fairly large book. I just could not put it down!            Go ahead with those Philippa Gregory, Margaret George, and Jean Plaidy books but, to truly understand and appreciate the lives of Henry the VIII's marriage partners, you must absolutely pick up this book. Highly recommended!

Yes, there are great songs, but why not give us, the fans something more for are money, some hard to find versions, remixes, new remixes, why should we put out our money for the same versions of these songs, and not even the best versions. WHY? Madonna, if you want our money , give us something we really want, something we dont have . I thought there was gonna be 2009 remixes of some of these songs, something fresh, as a fan, we already have these songs, Why are we gonna pay more money for the same old thing??? I dont know who cares less, Wb music, or madonna? maybe she has enough money, but its not right for the fans. the one who make her $$$$$. We all know what the orignal versions sound like, give the fans more. I was gonna buy this cd, but after hearing whats on here, I already have it. and you can get all this on most of her cd used on here. SO WHAT ARE YOU GIVING US MADONNA?????????? what?
0812979656|5.0|I read this book years ago, when it first came out, as an advanced reader edition. I thought that it was the most profound and beautiful thing that I had ever read. For all of these years I have never heard anything about it and thought that it had never been noticed. After just finishing it again I wanted to make sure that people knew about this. So I get on here and what do I see, but over 800 reviews and talk of critical acclaim! I'm so glad. It may not be for everyone, but for the people that it is for, the people who appreciate gorgeous, poetic prose, a great story line, and a real connection to truth, it is the best. I won't analyze it to death, but I think that what Arundhati Roy does with language is absolutely heavenly. I wish that I could write half as well as her. One of the best books ever written.

It is absolutely appauling how the senior executives at RJR Nabisco disregarded $50-100M in expenses as if it was too minimal for anyone to pay attention!  Private jets, airplane hangers, landscaping for the hanger, all expenses that the executives felt were completely acceptable and untouchable after a change in ownership.

HOWEVER, that does not stop her from having a cute sounding voice (she can carry a tune in my opinion) and having fun with her band on this record. It is a fun-filled infectious pop-rock anthem, and as long as I know Selena had fun singing, that's all that matters to me. I highly enjoyed this effort, and am eager for more from her as a musician.<br /><br />Highlights include the title track, Falling Down, and The Way I Loved You.

1416972242|5.0|City of Ashes is the 2nd installment in Cassandra Clare's enticing young adult Mortal Instruments trilogy.<br /><br />City of Ashes picks up where City of Bones ends.<br /><br />Warning: If you haven't already read City of Bones, I highly suggest reading it first, rather than starting with City of Ashes since it's not really a story that is considered a stand-alone.<br /><br />I will do my best not to pepper this review w/ spoilers because I don't think it is fair to ruin your reading pleasure.<br /><br />City of Ashes kicks off like the fireworks during a Macy's 4th of July celebration! Clare grabs hold of you & pulls you into the whirlwind supernatural adventure that is this astounding read.<br /><br />Clare delivers City of Ashes in 3rd person but is mostly from the delightful & empowering Clary's perspective. Clare does a phenomenal job showcasing Clary's perplexity @ all that is going on around her Shadowhunter sphere.<br /><br />Let me warn you, City of Ashes is an enthralling read & you will be hard pressed to put it down. Simply, Clare's Mortal Instruments Series reads like an epic flick ~ electrifying!<br /><br />What I love about Clare's writing is the delectable vibrancy sprinkled through out this fetching novel. City of Bones is stuffed w/ explosive action, dripping w/ topnotch tension & juicy goodness. The world of the Shadowhunters is charged w/ titillating nuggets that is not just breathtaking but makes your head spin.<br /><br />Clary's bff, Simon, definitely is one riveting member in this launching. He really did shatter the mold. Clare took the term \\"bring it\\" for the intriguing Simon & certainly did.<br /><br />The brother & sister Shadowhunter team , Alec & Isabelle are utterly enthralling. I truly enjoy reading about them.<br /><br />Magnus Bane is a mesmerizing player & one of my faves.<br /><br />Now, I will address the pink elephant in the room by saying everything isn't always what it seems (thank you, Cassandra).<br /><br />I have to be honest, the incestuous tones between Clary & Jace made my stomach roil & my skin crawl but things aren't always what they seem.<br /><br />Hurry up & grab a copy of City of Ashes!crawl but things aren't always what they seem.      Hurry up & grab a copy of City of Ashes!
B0029LHW4U|4.0|Mostly great album, I have listened constantly since downloading it Tuesday morning. I believe the new singer does Layne justice, and also agree that it does sound very similar to Jerry Cantrell's solo work. Whether Layne would be proud, I do not know. I am curious what this album would have been if Layne was still breathing.
B002BIMNDQ|5.0|A MUST READ FOR EVERY PARENT OF A CHILD WITH SPECIAL NEEDS! There are a lot of 'sirens' out there that try to lure you with a miracle cure promises. Often times they play your emotional strings so well that it is hard to resist. This book will save you from such costly mistakes. But there is more! It will help bulletproofing you from a sneakier landmine - the pseudo-science, which hides behind the pile of cleverly sounding words but appeals to the same magic bullet instincts.   Parents of special kids are among the people who have least of free time and mental space to contemplate such matters while being the most exposed to `jackpot winning' treatments. Ben Goldacre gives you a helping hand. This guy is a true crusader who punctures equally well the bubbles of both the alternative medicine and pharmaceutical industry and does it with wit.   There are very few doctors who are as unbiased as him. Most of them have too much of a corporate pride and arrogance (plus a large mortgage to pay for) to be able to look beyond the existent treatment routines. His genuine personality really underpins the entire book. Ben appears to be single, happy with his income and finding his greatest pleasures in intellectual finesse. He is a rare person who evaluates both alternative and mainstream treatments only on scientific merits and integrity without downgrading the argument to usual medical arrogance from a position of authority: \\"I am the MD, so shut up and listen\\"...   One really useful read that will equip you to see BS*** even when it is wrapped in `sciency'-sounding words.

0385504225|1.0|The best thing I can say about \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is that it made me want to visit the U.S. capital and see all its architectural treasures for myself. Apart from that, I found the book incredibly boring.    This time, our brilliant Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon immerses himself in the world of Freemasonry. A mysterious villain has kidnapped his Langdon's friend, a high-ranking mason, and blackmails Langdon into taking up the search for a mysterious pyramid for him, on which there is a (mysterious) map to be found, which in turn is supposed to lead to the (even more mysterious) location of the (most mysterious of all) \\"Ancient Mysteries\\". These are badly needed by the villain, it seems, because he expects them to help him complete his transformation into an all-powerful demon. Right.    Next, the mysterious director of a mysterious CIA branch steps on the scene. She's prepared to give the villain what he wants, even to sacrifice the lives of Langdon's friend and even Langdon himself. The reason is supposedly that there is much more at stake than just the mysteries of Freemasonry and a few people's lives - there is, in fact (drum roll) a mysterious national security crisis!    Trouble is, this supposed national security crisis is so mysterious that the reader doesn't learn until very late in the book what it is. Dan Brown is completely disregarding the first principle of creating suspense here - the reader has to know what's at stake. Of course, he might have a very good reason for doing it that way, because when we finally learn what's up with this \\"crisis\\", it turns out to be a damp squib. It doesn't amount to much more than a semi-serious PR crisis, really. Of course, there may have been a very good reason for Brown to do it that way. If that was all that he was able to come up with, maybe putting off this disclosure as long as possible was indeed his best bet.    Speaking of disclosure: Of course, there's again the Dan Brown Surprising Twist(tm) on page 448.Only unfortunately it doesn't come surprising to anyone anymore by that time, because we've been seeing it coming since page 221.    The same problem is affecting the puzzles, usually one of the most entertaining aspects in Brown's novels. This time, though, they are so disarmingly simple that the question why Langdon takes so long to solve them (and why a brilliant Harvard symbologist is needed for them anyway) is the most puzzling thing about them. Some of the solutions veritably jump in your face, and then you have to drag yourself through a dozen more pages until Langdon finally gets it, too. Maybe the professor should start thinking about retirement.    The book's biggest fault, though, is that it is made entirely of McGuffins - empty clichés that do their job as elements of suspense only as long as no one thinks too hard about what they actually are, like that famous briefcase everyone is after in Hitchcock's \\"39 Steps\\". In \\"The Lost Symbol\\", though, we go from one McGuffin to the next without ever getting to see what's in the briefcase, as it were. That would be impossible, of course, because there's nothing in it. Not until the very end, when everything's over really, does Brown find it necessary to have his hero and heroine stir around in the thin mystical-philosophical soup of \\"Tapping the Unused Potential of the Human Mind\\", which is supposed to be the essence of the \\"Ancient Mysteries\\" - just another empty cliché.    By that time, of course, the reader is so befuddled with boredom that chances are they'll never ask themselves what was the big secret about this groundbreaking revelation in the first place.    \\"Angels and Demons\\" was a highly entertaining, intelligent thriller. \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" was a bit silly, but if you kept one eye shut and pretended to know nothing about church history, it was a fairly suspenseful yarn at least. But \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is leagues beneath both these books. Who'd have thought Dan Brown can be a bore?
B002GZQYMK|2.0|I loved Muse, had been listening to almost no other band for months, now I can't even listen to their older stuff any longer because this album was so bad, devoid of everything that is(was) Muse, it is forced, fake, awkward, borrowed, pretentious, erratic, uninspired... need I go on?  Muse's well of creativity and vigor seems to have run dry, this over-contrived album is even worse than a sellout album, they could have stuck to their own style and sound like in Black Holes, but they instead tried to make it appear as some epic masterpiece.  To me, they have irrevocably damaged their image as a great, creative, talented band.
B002C6K7N0|4.0|The very first thing that you will notice when giving Endgame a first listen is that Megadeth has continued to hone their attack to full-stream metal goodness.  The riffs-aplenty approach seems to have been reinstated with a vengeance.  Here you will feel Dave Mustaine's original anger coming through on every track.  Has this always been the case?  Yeah, it has.  Dave is perpetually pissed off and that is one of the things that makes Megadeth both consistent and one of my all-time favorite bands.  When you buy a new Megadeth album,  even the weaker of the mid-to-late 90s efforts, you will never be fully disappointed.  A few stinkers here and there, but always a plethora of slamming metal.  Endgame is the next logical step from the excellent United Abominations and we appreciate that.  The intervening years have made us crave for something new, and now that we have it, we can listen in awe.  I have now listened to the entire album 25 times to get the full picture, to properly digest it, and here is what I took from it:<br /><br />Dialectic Chaos -  Great opening instumental, not to long, just the right 2 and a half minutes of thundering drums and spine-searing riffs that leads eloquently into the second song.  Dave's chops are up to par here and beyond.  You can feel the energy, the excellence of what Megadeth has evolved into.  Dave's comfort level has risen to the Nth degree and it shows on this masterpiece.<br /><br />This Day We Fight! - This song is angry.  This song is slamming.  This song is Dave unleashed.  The lyrics flow forward like bullets tearing your flesh.  You can feel the raw energy here and it's purely electric.  Reminds me just a smidge of Holy Wars.  Excellent.<br /><br />44 Minutes - Haunting intro of 911 calls that swims right into Dave's gritty, poignant commentary upon the state of the nation and it's affinity for violence.  Baptized in a firefight.  Hot blood running cold as ice...<br /><br />1,320' - Racing song?  Is this the next progression up from The Mechanix?  Yeah?  Oh Yeah!  This sounds like something right off Killing Is My Business... and that is a good thing.  The riff is infectious and grooving.  This is what you find here on Endgame,  back-to-basics, short, concise and straight to the point.<br /><br />Bite The Hand - Just like the mad dog, that bites the hand that feeds...  Social commentary, thy name is Dave Mustaine.  I have to go back to Countdown To Extinction for this song, because that's the way it feels.  You have the pulsing, grinding groove of older Megadeth with soloing riffs all over the place.  Great song.<br /><br />Bodies - This reminds me of something off The World Needs A Hero.  It lacks something of a hook and the progressions are a bit stumbling.  Musically, it is good, but I'm not sure I'm going to remember this one for very long.<br /><br />Endgame - Futuristic appocalypse.  New World Order.  This feels rehashed from previous Megadeth efforts.  Rocks, but too many Mustaine cliches in the lyrics hurt this song. Just feels like it's been done too many times to make it a great song.<br /><br />The Hardest Part Of Letting Go...  - Moody, brooding, and stunning.  People don't really understand that Dave does some of his best work when he slows it down and shows us that he's still a human being.  Like Promises on The World Needs A Hero, which was a truly underrated song, this song builds upon itself to a rising crescendo.  I like it.  Other Megadeth fans may not appreciate it's subtle excellence.<br /><br />Head Crusher - Just like it's title, this is a thrashing good time!  Blasting!  Wailing!  Now let the torture begin!<br /><br />How The Story Ends - The chorus here is one of the few songs that has a definite hook that you can pick up on the first time around.  Unlike most of the other songs that take time to grow on you, How The Story Ends comes at you right away.  Great.<br /><br />The Right To Go Insane - Unlike most album enders, which most of the time nowadays is purefiller, this song breaks the mold.  The lyrics are tight and angry.  ....so I think I'll go insane.<br /><br />Overall, Megadeth does not disappoint.  This is metal for your money.  Where other bands have tried to reinvent themselves or moved backwards to rekindle lost magic, Megadeth stands pretty much alone.  When you slap down your hard earned cash, Dave is gonna give you every penny's worth.  Not to be confused with their finest efforts like Peace or Countdown or whatever you feel is their best, this is new Megadeth and Dave Mustaine is, and always has been, in the driver's seat.  So you know where you're headed. There is a strange absence of hooks on this album and that breaks it down just a notch because you will have to listen to it a few dozen times before you can say, yeah, that's a great song.  Sonically, it is metal.  The chops are tight, the drums will crush your skull, and Dave's lyrics are as angry and masterful as ever for the most part.  Not perfection, but that is rare.<br /><br />Dig it!k I'll go insane.      Overall, Megadeth does not disappoint.  This is metal for your money.  Where other bands have tried to reinvent themselves or moved backwards to rekindle lost magic, Megadeth stands pretty much alone.  When you slap down your hard earned cash, Dave is gonna give you every penny's worth.  Not to be confused with their finest efforts like Peace or Countdown or whatever you feel is their best, this is new Megadeth and Dave Mustaine is, and always has been, in the driver's seat.  So you know where you're headed. There is a strange absence of hooks on this album and that breaks it down just a notch because you will have to listen to it a few dozen times before you can say, yeah, that's a great song.  Sonically, it is metal.  The chops are tight, the drums will crush your skull, and Dave's lyrics are as angry and masterful as ever for the most part.  Not perfection, but that is rare.      Dig it!

B002PEP4SC|5.0|I am an avid fan of ABC's Castle (Monday nights 10/9c) and was excited to read Richard Castle's latest book, Heat Wave. For those who are not in the know, Nathan Fillion stars as Richard Castle, a famous mystery novelist who is initially called in to help the NYPD solve a copy-cat murder based on his novels. Stana Katic stars opposite as the young detective Kate Beckett. Following his encounter with Beckett, Castle decides to use her as the model for his next book series. He uses his contacts and receives permission to accompany Beckett while investigating cases. [thanks Wikipedia]  Heat Wave is the first of Castle's new book series: Nikki Heat. My favorite thing is every character is believable & I can picture all of them. I love Rook and Heat and their scenes are amazing. I can totally picture Castle dreaming & writing each scene they are in together. And if you are asking yourself, does it really have a story line? Yes, in fact, it takes so many twists and turns that the minute you think you have a suspect, new information comes in and you have to re-evaluate all the evidence. Some points drag on a bit but it helps you get into the story; you are right there in NYC traffic with Heat & Rook trying to fly but the siren means absolutely nothing in the standstill of traffic.  When scenes get too tense, Characters are there to crack a joke or banter between each other, including how many ways to describe a bookie's muscle. Overall, ABC did a great job on this TV tie in and the writers should be applauded and given pay raises. I hope to get more Nikki Heat and I am hoping Det. Beckett reads Heat Wave and comments about the book; especially the blackout sequences.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|In my mind, \\"The White Album\\" is The Beatles' most ambitious and daring album.  It's really hit or miss with most, especially since there are more songs than usual on a single album and the fact that there are some bizarre numbers on here would be an understatement.  One thing was for sure, The Beatles were continuing to evolve as a band and doing a fine job of never putting out the same album twice.  This isn't my #1 favorite album of theirs, but it's definitely up there with the best.<br /><br />As with some of their classic albums like \\"Abbey Road\\" and \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" this is more enjoyable when you listen to it as a whole and in order.  Songs like \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" and \\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\\" may not be my favorite songs by themselves, but they certainly go together well when you're hearing the entire album.  You may find a lot of that with \\"The White Album,\\" but it's just another great reason why entire albums should still be relevant.  There are some other bizarre cuts like \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" and \\"Revolution 9\\" that would not sound very good by themselves, but you don't mind them when you're hearing the album in its entirety.<br /><br />While it's easy to be lost in the giant song collection that's available, one cannot forget how many great tunes are here for the taking.  \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun,\\" \\"Glass Onion,\\" \\"Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey,\\" \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,\\" \\"Helter Skelter,\\" \\"Sexy Sadie,\\" \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.,\\" \\"Cry Baby Cry,\\" \\"Yer Blues,\\" \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" \\"Birthday,\\" \\"I'm So Tired\\" and \\"Revolution 1\\" come to my mind.  Those are not the only good ones, but those are my favorites.<br /><br />The 2009 Remaster sounds fantastic to me.  You can hear the guitars, bass, drums and vocals with great clarity.  I don't have any past releases of this album so I can't really make a fair comparison, but I can honestly say that I'm very happy with this new release.  For optimal sound, make sure you play this baby out loud.  Headphones are nice, but you won't get the full experience that way.  The mini-documentary that's included is a sweet extra.  It's short, but it's definitely worth checking out.<br /><br />\\"The White Album\\" once again shows that The Beatles weren't afraid of evolving and changing up their styles and songwriting with each release.  There are many fine tunes to be found on this epic 2-disc set.  If you're just starting to get into The Beatles and are curious about them, I don't know if I'd recommend that you start with this one.  Still, as the song says, \\"Don't pass me by,\\" this is something you definitely don't want to skip over. - Michael Cranes baby out loud.

B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones is the daughter of Pandit Ravi Shankar and was raised in Texas.  One magnificent sitar player and one country and western type.  It shows.  She's a pianist and there's nothing pretentious here -- her piano backed up by a guitar and a rather routine rhythm section.  Her voice is a little breathless and uncaring about being spot on the note.  She's a vernacular singer.  The range is easy and the tempo moderate and relaxes.  Easy to listen to.  I don't mean that it's a poor performance in any way.  God knows that it's light years ahead of the seven-layered tracks of most pop singers.  And the arrangements are sometimes exquisite.  You may have heard Hank Williams sing \\"Your Cold Cold Heart\\" a thousand times but you've never heard it done like this.<br /><br />It's hard to classify the album.  \\"Easy Listening\\" might do it, but it's got jazz and country-and-western overtones.  The easiest listening, if you want to think it in those terms, is the last track.  It's easy listening alright, but Willy Nelson would have tackled it with impunity.<br /><br />Summary?  Not bad.  What happened to Norah Jones anyway?
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|Comic book fans are in Heaven right now. Movies are being made left and right based on comic books. Recent releases like WHITEOUT and SURROGATES are both based on comics. And while they're a few years back, the X-MEN movies were always hits. So it's no surprise that the most popular character of the comics and films would get his own solo flick.<br /><br />X-MEN ORIGINS:WOLVERINE begins in 1845 when young James Howlett kills a man for killing his father, only to discover that the man he's killed is actually his biological dad. On the run with his half-brother Victor Creed, the pair bound through history, both mutants with the ability to self heal and age slowly. Their killing abilities are utilized in all wars, but it is Victor who seems to enjoy it while James merely sticks with his brother.<br /><br />Fast forward to the Vietnam War with Victor (Liv Schreiber) and James (Hugh Jackman) facing a firing squad only to survive. In prison, they are recruited by General Stryker (Danny Huston) for a unique squad that will covertly take care of problems for the U.S. Composed of various other mutants, the team often rustles each other's feathers, but do the wet work their job requires of them. The killing begins to get to James, now known as Logan, and he quits the team.<br /><br />The scene changes to several years later and Logan is now living happily in Canada as a lumberjack with a woman he loves, Kayla (Lynn Collins). Stryker arrives to tell Logan that someone is killing the ex-members of the team and to be careful. The warning is too late and we are there to see Victor meet up with Kayla. When Logan finds her body, he tracks down Stryker to be a part of his secret project, Weapon X, in an attempt to turn Logan into an indestructible killer. When asked what his dog tags should read, he says Wolverine, a reference to a story Kayla had told him.<br /><br />The procedure nearly kills Wolverine as the scientists inject molten adamantium, the strongest metal known to man, to his skeletal system. Where he once had bones, he now has adamantium. And where skeletal claws once popped from his fists, now shining blades appear. As the process is completed, Wolverine overhears the group planning on killing him. In a rage, he leaps from the lab's tank and takes out anyone in his way, escaping to a nearby farm.<br /><br />But the welcome an elderly couple there provides is short lived as Stryker's assassins kill them both and try to get Wolverine. Once more in a rage, Wolverine takes out the team. But before Agent Zero (Daniel Henney) dies, he lets Wolverine know that Stryker has been behind it all.<br /><br />Wolverine seeks out the rest of the team to find out where Stryker has gone to ground. With the help of two he is sent to New Orleans to meet a mutant named Gambit (Taylor Kitsch), the only mutant to escape from \\"the island\\", a secret location of Stryker's where he is experimenting on mutants, like Scott Summers and Emma Frost (two main characters from the comics). Out for blood, Wolverine convinces Gambit to take him there and attempts to put an end to Stryker's experiments and Victor for killing the woman he loved.<br /><br />The film is action packed from beginning to end. The scenes and set ups bring to mind numerous images from comics past as well as characters that have become legends at Marvel comics. One is even on fast track to have his own film, Deadpool played by Ryan Reynolds. He becomes a major force in the film, though to reveal why would ruin the surprise.<br /><br />The effects are amazing here. Any and every possible effect is used for maximum advantage and it shows. Streets blow up, buildings come down a brick at a time and powers shoot from eyes and playing cards. Not to mention the adamantium claws fans are so familiar with.<br /><br />The acting is better than most would think, with Jackman now comfortable in the lead role. But Schreiber as Victor Creed is amazing. His feline like qualities from his stance to his bloodlust comes off as realistic. And Reynolds as the smart aleck Deadpool deserves his own film.<br /><br />The first time I saw this film I left unimpressed. I think perhaps I was too stoked by the hype surrounding it. This time I got to enjoy it for the sake of the film itself. I wasn't disappointed. You don't have to see the other films to enjoy this one. As a matter of fact, it actually would be better to watch this then the rest. Any way you look at it, you can expect to find plenty of action, plenty of story, and plenty of thrills that will entertain from opening to closing credits.eserves his own film.

0451167716|5.0|I'm usually not a fan of reading books based on movies I've already seen, especially ones that I've seen enough times that the images from the movie are indelibly etched in the brain. It's for that reason that, even though I've seen The Godfather, The Godfather, Part II , and, yes, even The Godfather, Part III , I was reluctant to actually sit down and read Mario Puzo's 1969 novel which started the whole saga, partly because I thought it would disappoint me, and partly because I thought that my near-photographic memory of the movies would in some sense ruin the book which was, of course, written well before Brando, Pacino, Duvall, and Caan ever picked up a script.    Boy, was I wrong.    While it's impossible to read about any member of the Corleone family without seeing the actors that portrayed them, or to read through the chapters about, say, the Connie Corleone wedding scene, without remembering how it was portrayed in the movie, that really doesn't detract at all from the experience of reading what turned out to be a very good book.    For the true Godfather fan, of course, the interesting thing to note are the differences between the book and the movies (plural because there are elements of the novel that show up in both The Godfather and The Godfather, Part II ). Some of them are understandable, such as the amount of time that Puzo takes up telling the back stories of characters such as Bonasera the undertaker and Johnny Fontane, because they would have made the movie much longer and more difficult to make. Others are more like little continuity errors; for example, in the book Michael and Kay's children are both boys, in the movie they are a boy and a girl, in the book you Vito was an only child, in the movie he had an older brother who had been murdered in a Mafia vendetta. There are several others, of course, including the fact that some of the movies most famous lines don't appear in the book at all.    On the whole, though, Puzo does a fabulous job of letting us into the world of the Corleone family and, while some have accused the films of romanticizing organized crime, a bogus charge in my opinion, you certainly can't accuse the books of doing that. Yes, Vito Corleone comes across as something of a noble figure who believes he's only doing what he needs to do to project his family, but the lie behind that becomes apparently pretty quickly and, when his youngest son takes his place, it becomes blatant.    Even if you're not a fan of the movies, this is a great read. If you are a fan, it's an essential one.
0061730327|5.0|[...]    ---    William Kamkwamba, the author of The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind, lives in the village of Wimbe in the Kasungu district of Malawi with his parents and four sisters. In his memoir, William laments that only 2 percent of Malawians have electricity, so it is not rare to go to bed at 7pm. The family depends on maize and tobacco crops, and when their farm fails to provide a substantial income, William is forced to drop out of secondary school. His spare time is spent at the library, reading physics books.    But when the famine of 2002 hits, William has to put his independent studies aside to help his family scrounge for food. With distressing detail, William describes how a combination of ill-fated weather, deforestation, and a neglectful government causes his family to go from eating three full meals a day to eating only seven mouthfuls, and then three. Reading this part of the book from the perspective of an American is plainly sad, and it's a distinct change in tone from William's vivid portrayal of daily village life and folklore.    Most of us will never experience such famine, and most shocking is how swiftly it can overtake an entire population. But William manages to remain somewhat upbeat throughout the crisis and his family persists through this hardship and others, such as malaria and cholera, without losing a single member.    When his famine finally ends, five months later, William returns to his studies determined to make sure his family never suffers again. Captivated with the way electricity works, he begins gathering stray materials with his best friend, Geoffrey. The young boys' friendship is touching and their loyalty to one another -- a true characteristic of boyhood -- is admirable.    From the scrap yard, William collects tractor fans, shock absorbers, wheels, PVC pipes, and an assortment of other oddities, leading the entire village to make fun of his unusual collecting habit. But he soon proves them wrong by constructing a small windmill that is able to power lights and radio.    When the media gets word of William's ingenuity, it's fascinating to read a firsthand account of the young boy being whisked away to the TED conference, seeing the Internet for the first time, and using donors' money to further help his village and return to school.    As he explains, \\"...It would have to be done little by little, but once complete, it would save my parents the money they normally spent on kerosene, and that was just the beginning. The next machine would pump water for our fields. And I wouldn't stop there. One day, windmills would be our shield against hunger.\\"    William is a hero and his resourcefulness deserves to be recognized. Compensating for the local government's void in empathy, William is able to become wholly self sufficient, sharing entertaining stories and customs along the way. William's compelling and valiant character makes it easy to read in one afternoon what one boy managed to change for an entire existence of people.    ---    [...]

B0029LHW4U|1.0|Jerry Cantrell has made a mockery of Layne's memory with this album.  Not only does William Duvall attempt to sound Like Layne and replace him, but Cantrell himself also tries to fill the void by mimicing Layne with his vocals.  In the original band, Cantrell and Staley could harmonize together, but each had their own unique voices.  In this incarnation, Cantrell attempts to recreate Layne's wails and \\"oh yeahs,\\" etc.  Pathetic.  It was low enough of him to go on using the same name, but it is even lower how they are trying to replace Layne with their sound.  Although they try to sound like AIC, the album ends up sounding nothing like an AIC record, apart from the two singles.  The lyrics are trite, stupid, and not representative of the darkness AIC is known for.  Take \\"Check My Brain\\" for example.  The song is about how Jerry Cantrell moved to California, was surprised that he actually likes it there, and is asking someone to check his brain because he can't believe it.  Look it up.  He said it himself.  What a dumb thing to write a song about.  Even the title track, which is supposed to be a tribute to Layne, is not respectful of him.  A closer look at the lyrics reveals a song that accuses Layne of not even trying to stop doing drugs and states that it was easier for him to keep using than to have to feel anything.  Anyone who read Layne's final interview would know this was not the case.  Layne stated he was no longer doing drugs to get high and it was no longer pleasurable for him.  His body was so sick and dependent on the drugs that he would be violently ill if he didn't use them.  He had tried to quit before but couldn't do it.  He also suffered from a broken heart from the death of his girlfriend.  Overall, this album is just wrong.  If they had changed the name and not attempted to sound like Layne, that would be fine.  The same people who are here praising this album would s@#$% a brick if Nirvana were to regroup with a replacement for Kurt Cobain; or how about Paul and Ringo assembling a new band with Lennon and Harrison impersonators called The Beatles?  What makes this any different?about Paul and Ringo assembling a new band with Lennon and Harrison impersonators called The Beatles?  What makes this any different?

B0029LHW4U|5.0|I'm a huge Alice In Chains fan & have been from the beginning. I've seen them live in the 90's about 3 times including Layne's last live performance which was in Kansas City. Layne was a huge part of the band & in my opinion his vocals are unmatched in rock music of the last 20 years. Often imitated, but never duplicated.    That said, Jerry Cantrell is also a huge part of this band & I'm glad he never let it die. This band is still relatively young (arnd 40) & can provide us many more years of great songs to come. But what about the new singer? Not the same old AIC. Forgot about comparing DuVall to Staley. His vocals are fantastic & very reminiscent of Layne's. They fit beautifully on this album. Who wants a new singer who sounds completely different? Alice lives on through this album.     I was hooked from the first song (which may be my personal favorite) & listened to it over & over. I saw DuVall with Alice about 3 years ago & they freakin rocked. The crowd was stunned because they didn't know what to expect, but EVERYONE left that venue with a huge smile.     3 years later we have the best rock album of 2009. Do yourself a favor & go pick it up right now. If you are an Alice fan, or just a fan of great hard rock in general, you will not be disappointed. Just stop comparing DuVall to Cantrell. Enjoy the music & be happy they are back in true form!

0312853238|5.0|I approached this expansion of the award-winning novella with some reluctance, because I was afraid of being disappointed. Novels based on shorter works sometimes add little more than filler, really; but \\"Ender's Game\\" adds both story and characterization. Does it ever! It tells the same tale, that of a little boy named Andrew Wiggin who goes by the nickname \\"Ender\\" because he is his parents' third child in a world where exceptions to a strict two-child limit per couple are not granted lightly. Ender Wiggin's parents conceive him because the future Earth of this story faces an enemy so alien that only a child's creativity, a child's inability to comprehend that certain things are impossible, can hope to defeat that enemy. Their first two children, Ender's siblings Peter and Valentine, possess the intelligence and the creative gifts the authorities know they need; but neither's temperament allows those gifts to be used as first Battle School and then Command School can teach Ender to use them.<br /><br />Battle School, where most of the book takes place, is a space station where brilliant children from six to twelve years of age train relentlessly in combat and tactical \\"games\\" that have a deadly serious purpose. Small Ender is deliberately isolated by teachers who push him to his limits, as they realize that the crisis they are preparing him to meet will come long before he can complete his training on a normal schedule. He has to be ready sooner - and he has to learn to lead other children who are almost his equals.<br /><br />This book chilled me, because it felt absolutely real; and Ender's universe was not a nice place to be. Yet not only Ender himself, but the book's other characters, too, made me keep turning pages until I wound up finishing it at 2 a.m. An amazing piece of work!<br /><br />--Reviewed by Nina M.

0446528056|5.0|Dear John is one those stories that make a deep impact on the reader, to the point where you will be thinking about it for days or even a lot longer. It's a well-written beautiful story with relatable characters, yet heart wrenching. I feel like the ending left off unresolved to where I felt some of the characters weren't at total peace. A strong feeling of wanting something that you will never be able to have was too overwhelming for me. Be prepared to cry way too much and have a horrible feeling in the pit of your stomach. While I enjoyed this story it was very painful.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|I'm in the middle of listening to the album for the third time as I write this review. The initial listens were great. The band has really fine tuned its sound following up their excellent Riot!    The strongest members of this band are the lead singer, Hayley Williams, and drummer,Zac Farro. I feel that the reason why these members stick out (other than Hayley's unbelievable amount of cuteness) is that they have been the forerunners on previous albums. This still rings true for Brand New Eyes but we also get to see guitarists, Josh Farro and Taylor York, doing some cool riffs as well as solos. Also the bassist, Jeremy Davis, gets to lay down a meaty bass line in Brick By Boring Brick (not as epic as Fences but still pretty good) as well as doing a solid job on all the other songs. Overall it feels like the band keeps getting tighter as they refine their sound.    -The album starts out at a blazing pace with Careful. This song screams classic Paramore (a good thing).  -Ignorance keeps the momentum moving with another song that sounds like classic Paramore. Watch out for the 15 second long shredding solo near the end!  -Playing God is where the momentum shifts to a slower more emotional pace. Just need to point out that the Paramore boys get to do some backing vocals on this album starting with this song. Not the strongest track on the album but not bad by any means.  -Brick By Boring Brick as I mentioned earlier has an awesome bass line! Very strong song.  -Turn It Off is a slower song that picks up its pace during the chorus. Hayley takes the center stage on this song showing off her vocal awesomeness. The instrumental ending is a very nice touch.  -The Only Exception busts out the acoustic guitars. I can easily see this song showing up in a movie during a very melancholy montage. Just a tidbit this is the longest Paramore song to date...  -Feeling Sorry is a pretty solid song. Noting really exceptional but still good.  -Looking Up is much like Feeling Sorry. Nothing special but still a good song.  -Where The Lines Overlap follows the same formula as the last two songs, however this song is a bit better. Once again I really dig the instrumental ending!  -Misguided Ghosts brings the acoustic guitars out again. Brilliant song. Hayley shows just how beautiful her voice is. My only complaint is that this song ends to early.  -All I Wanted starts out slow but picks up as the song progresses. Very solid song that is a fitting end to the album.    Overall a great album that pushes the band forward. If you are looking for Riot 2.0 you may be a bit disappointed as the band tries some new things. My only complaint about the album is that there isn't a song that enters your head and never leaves. Heck I've had dreams with That's What You Get in it.     Cliff notes: It's great, just buy it already!
B0029LHW4U|5.0|From the opening line \\"A new beginning...\\", this album owned me. I was a fan of AIC back in the 90's and thought that the band had died with Staley. I am very very pleased with this album. The sound and feel take me back many years to when I was younger.   The new singer I like. Of course he will not replace Staley, this we all know. I will give him the credit though, he fits the music. I know sooooo many people will not like him simply because he is not Staley, I refuse to do this.   If you are a fan of AIC, all I have to say is this....  BUY IT!!!!
B000002OX7|5.0|Many great songs can be found on all of The Who's albums from the '70s, but frankly, all of them fall short of \\"Who's Next.\\"  This album is perfect.  From the opening keyboard riffs on \\"Baba O'Riley\\" to the highly climactic ending of \\"Won't Get Fooled Again,\\" this truly is the best of The Who.    \\"Meaty Beaty Big And Bouncy\\" is a collection of their early work (1965-70), and \\"Who's Next\\" from 1971 completes the collection of hits as far as I'm concerned.  \\"Baba O'Riley,\\" \\"Bargain,\\" \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" and \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" are all here.  In my opinion, that could almost be one whole side (I'm talking vinyl here) of a Greatest Hits album.  In addition to those, we get underrated gems like \\"Love Ain't For Keeping\\" and \\"My Wife.\\"    The band sound energetic, explosive and very exciting throughout, and Roger's vocals are truly in their prime.  I do like select songs from their later catalogue (1973's \\"The Real Me\\" and \\"5:15\\"; 1978's \\"Who Are You\\" are good examples), but as far as looking at an album from start to finish, this is just about the last one they made that truly captures and keeps my attention.    This is easily the band's finest hour.  Couple \\"Who's Next\\" with \\"Meaty Beaty Big And Bouncy\\" and you've essentially got the best of The Who.

B0025KVLVA|5.0|I've been giving these remasters a good listening to, including comparisons with the 1987 CDs and, for the greatest part, they are a significant improvement over the the 87s.  Each of the instruments is cleaned and defined where you can listen specifically to a single instrument.  All the muddiness has been removed, imperfections cleared, and vocals personalized.<br /><br />Whereas before all the vocals kind of blended together, now you can decipher John, Paul, and George's voices individually even when singing together.  This better seperation does not, imo, affect the overall sound as compared to the originals, on the contrary, it enhances each song because each instrument and vocal line are more precise and individual.<br /><br />With that being said, I truely enjoy this CD, as it combines their biggest singles onto one set.  This entire set is special and the remastering makes it even more so.  So if you like the Beatles, this would be a great place to start.  5 stars.  Highly recommended.

Also, during part of this time, Skynyrd was on their \\"World Tour\\" with Kid Rock on the \\"Rock + Rebels\\" Tour. However, they made time in between gigs to get into the studio and record this ablum. Also, during the recording of this album CD, Ean Evans their bassist, and Billy Powell their piano player, and Original Band Member both died. Roughly half of the songs on this cd include Billy Powell on the piano.<br /><br />This album cd is dedicated to Ean Evans & Billy Powell.<br /><br />The liner notes also list some other musicians included in recording this cd, these include John 5 (Marilyn Manson's guitarist), and Rob Zombie.<br /><br />The Lynyrd Skynyrd Website list the addition of the following new members:<br />Peter \\"Keys\\" Pisarczyk - keyboards - The new keyboard player after Billy's death. He was previously the keyboardist for George Clinton & P.Funk.<br />Robert Kearns - bass - The new bass player after Eans's death. He was previously the backup bass player for Ian Evans, after Ean was diagnosed with cancer.<br /><br />The song set is as follows:<br />1.Still Unbroken (they've been through hell, but ther're still unbroken)<br />2.Simple Life (kinda has the theme of \\"Simple Man\\")<br />3.Little Thing Called You<br />4.Southern Ways (This song makes reference to the \\"hell house\\", it was the uninsulated, un-air conditioned building, where Ronnie and the guys, would hang out and write songs, and practice.)<br />5.Skynyrd Nation (This is about 1st, 2nd & 3rd generation, Lynyrd Skynyrdfans forming a \\"Skynyrd Nation\\", and about rocking with the rebel flag)<br />6.Unwrite that Song<br />7.Floyd<br /><br />8.That Ain't My America (This one has a strong message about the \\"wrong direction\\" this Country is headed in, and includes the lyrics \\"Sometimes I want to light up beneath a no smoking sign....you can take you Change on down the line & leave me here with mine, Cause that ain't my America, that ain't this country's roots,... kids can't pray in school,$100 tanks of gas, I can tell you right now this Country ain't suppost to be like that...This ain't my America, this ain't this Country's roots, you want to slam ole Uncle Sam, but I ain't lettin' you.....This is for the men & women who hold a Bible & a Gun, and they ain't afraid of nothin', when they're holding either one....\\")<br /><br />9.Comin' Back for More<br /><br />10.God & Guns (Contains a strong message \\"God & Guns make us strong.....\\"We might as well give up an run, if we let them take our God & Guns\\", the song mentions that things have changed since the old days, & now you need to lock your doors & have a gun for self defense. This song is different from the Ronnie Van Zant song \\"Saturday Night Special\\", I love & I understand both songs. According to the book \\"Freebirds\\", by Marley Brant, Ronnie's widow stated, that Ronnie had bought her a .38 Special & taugh her how to use it for self defense. However, she goes on to state that Ronnie was for proper control & use of handguns. He was totally against irresponsible people having access to handguns. But he seemed to be for responsible people,owning handguns, for self protection, as long as the bad guys have their handguns.)<br /><br />11.Storm,<br />12.Gifted Hands ( a great tribute song to the ,\\"gifted hands\\" of the late/great, original member),& plane crash survivor, Billy Powell.)<br /><br />The Special Edition double CD, contains an extra disc, with 2 more new studio songs, and 3 live songs, from their 1997 concert at Freedom Hall in Louisville, Kentucky. The studio song \\"Hobo Kinda Man\\", is very similiar to the late Ronnie's \\"Railroad Song\\", from the \\"Nothin' Fancy\\" album.<br /><br />This is a great one, by the legendary Lynyrd Skynyrd Band, and I highly, gladly recommend it. This band has been through hell many times, but yet they still rock on, just as good as ever. This release is \\"AWESOME\\". Thanks, and May God Bless!!!

B001OQCV2Y|5.0|A group of Jewish American soldiers. A girl who has fled her home after the brutal massacre of her family. And a group of Nazis occupying France, who will premiere their Nazi propaganda movie at a small theater. How do all these topics fit all together? They are the pieces that form the puzzle that is \\"Inglourious Basterds\\".<br /><br />Brad Pitt plays Lt. Aldo Raine, a Jewish-American solider leading a group of other Jewish-American soldiers, named \\"The Inglourious Basterds\\", into France. Their job is to do one thing- exact their revenge against the Nazis for their horrible crimes against humanity. They plan to brutally scalp the Nazis and kill them. As Raine says, \\"We're killin' Nazis, and business is bloomin'\\". They have also targeted a movie theater, where the premiere of the aforementioned Nazi propaganda movie is to take place.<br /><br />Shosanna Dreyfus is a French Jewish girl who has fled her home after the Nazis have massacred her family. She flees to a movie theater that her aunt gave to her long after she died. One night, she meets a charming young man outside the theater, and the next day she sees him again. She is annoyed by him, but is invited by the man to lunch. Turns out he is a Nazi soldier, and that he has brought her to his Nazi family. Hans Linda, the Nazi leader who massacred her family, tells Shosanna and the Nazi family that her theater is the perfect place to premiere the movie. After it is confirmed that the premiere at her cinema is officially \\"Nazi Night\\", Shosanna and her partner projectionist have only one plan- to burn the theater to the ground.<br /><br />Coming in at 154 minutes, \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" is a film that does not overstay its welcome. Every minute of its length is epic, and the whole time, you're glued to your theater seat, wanting to know what happens next. The way Quentin Tarantino structures the plot, he sticks to his usual \\"Chapters\\" formula, and presents the two stories in a way in which in the last 45 minutes, they come together like pieces of a puzzle. This is enough to keep any moviegoer satisfied!<br /><br />As for performances, every single performance in this is amazing. Pitt does a brilliant job at portraying the cold and brutal personality of Aldo Raine. Also in the film is Diane Kruger, who plays Bridget, a woman the Basterds meet along the way. She has proved herself to be quite the actress over time, and with her being German, she is definitely an easy target for the role. But the REAL star of the show is Christoph Waltz, playing Hans Linda. He steals the show in every aspect here, and he's the type you wouldn't imagine playing a cold and ruthless Nazi.<br /><br />If you're a big fan of Tarantino, you can also expect his usual trademarks: Red Apple Cigarettes, The woman's feet shot, the usage of music from other movies (the music of Ennio Morricone is a huge character here), and the homage to other films. All of these are shown in the film. The film pays homage to European WWII movies, and does it brilliantly. Also, his dialogue, which is something he's been known for, is the best dialogue in any of his films.<br /><br />Think of \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" as \\"Pulp Fiction\\" set in Nazi-Occupied in France. In short,\\" Inglourious Basterds\\" is a phenomenal piece of film-making and proved to be an excellent day at the cinema.es of a puzzle. This is enough to keep any moviegoer satisfied!

0385504225|5.0|I have been reading a lot of these reviews from others who have read this book. I disagree with almost all of them. One reviewer stated that it was \\"fast paced, as the DaVince Code was,\\" yet I found it very slow paced, especially at the beginning. It went on and on about why Robert Langdon was in D.C. and all the background on how he was called there and the relationships with Peter Solomon and his sister, etc., to the point that I was about ready to abandon it if it did not get more interesting and thankfully, it finally did, but took a long, rambling path to get to that point, but it wasn't all in vain and a waste of time, as the action did pick up slightly after the hand was discovered, but it still took about the entire book to get to an answer that wasn't that hard to figure out, as we all know it anyway, and I had figured it out well before the end, not everything, of course, but what the \\"secret word\\" was, as I am sure most everyone did. I admit it is made up of many, many small chapters, as another reviewer pointed out, a couple of them just one page, and most of them anywhere from one and a half pages to three or four, very rarely any over that many pages, but hey, a chapter is just a number and can literally be ignored, they don't mean anything except to let you know that the story is going to jump to another part, with some of the other characters featured rather than the one you are currently reading about. In spite of all of this, it is an entertaining read, if it had not been, all of these negative reviewers would not have finished reading it!  All the puzzles and symbols got a little tiring, but they were very interesting and are part of the plot so had to be there. And as always, with all of his books, he leaves you wondering how much is made up (fiction) and how much is really true, especially when dealing with the Masons. We hear so much about the secret rites and initiations in that organization that we really don't know what the truth is about them, and my husband is a Mason, has been for forty years and I still know nothing at all about what goes on at their meetings or teh initiations!  Of course, he denies most of the \\"secrets\\" that this book \\"tells\\" about them. I only know, and know it first hand, that the organization does do a LOT of good works, especially where children are concerned. I know that the Scottish Rite Hospitals does tremendous work for burn victims and without payment if necessary. They also help crippled children without payment. A nephew of my husband's family who was born crippled was taken care of for years and fitted with needed leg braces free of charge, so I cannot say anything bad about the Masons and Shriners. My husband is a Shriner(which is just another degree of Free Masonry, I think) and has driven the buses that take burned children from our home state to Cincinnati,OH numerous times to be treated there. As for this book by Dan Brown, it has been described here as not being \\"great literature.\\"  Tell me, please, just what is \\"Great literature?\\"  I have been reading all of my life and have read books in all genres. To be honest, I still can't answer that question accurately. I have read books that are supposed to be \\"great literature\\" like \\"War and Peace\\" \\"The Quincunx\\"(worst, most boring book in the world, bored me to insanity almost, my recommendation: Don't read it, it is lousy) \\"Madame Bovary\\" and many others that some call \\"Great Literature.\\" Well, frankly, I don't know what is so \\"great\\" about them, they are usually always very boring.  And whether he (Dan Brown)is supposed to be a great writer or not, judging by the number of books he has written and how long \\"The DaVinci Code\\" stayed on the best seller lists, he must be doing something right and evidently people buy and read his books, so what makes him different or judged as \\"not a good writer?\\" Seems a lot of people consider him good enough to look forward to and enjoy his books. I certainly do and I liked the storyhe has written in this book and found it very entertaining and a really good mystery isn't that why we read a book? To be entertained and get enjoyment from reading it? I experienced both of these emotions so I consider it a \\"good book!\\" And as for Brown's writing skills, they seem as good as any other author that I have read, they tell a story and make it clear and concise through the words that are used, and what else makes a \\"good writer,\\" pray tell? And he usually wraps it all up neatly at the end, so what more do you want? I was satisfied with \\"THE LOST SYMBOL\\" and not sorry that I have read it, in spite of the rather slow beginning. It got very interesting farther into it. Is \\"Gone With The Wind\\" considered \\"great literature?\\" Or does it have to be a very, very old book and boring, to be considered \\"great literature? I am on a Forum about great literature and it is surprising at the number of \\"book snobs\\" on that Forum who seem to think that if a book isn't old and boring or translated from some Asian language, like Japanese or Chinese, it isn't worth reading and only \\"not very intelligent\\" people read books that do not fall into that category. I think they are just trying to impress others with their own \\"intelligence\\" which can be seen very plainly in their postings isn't really that great at all. They actually appear to be very unintelligent with some of their rambling postings about \\"the translations\\" instead of being about the books and the content and the stories that the books tell. It is people like that that is constantly putting Dan Brown's books down.    Alphia D. Larkins

B000N6TX1S|5.0|Wondering how Bette Davis' character from \\"All About Eve\\" wound up in my title headline?  Simple...  the sentiment is there and as strong in either hard-hitting film.<br /><br />I personally agree that life, as shown in this film is a clear and most probable depiction of how we can expect to find our world by mid-century.  That's scarey!<br /><br />The \\"goody-goody\\" viewers will not heed (or even understand)the images being presented as a warning to us, in this fantastically framed super-drama. The folks who know the story reads true, will have already started precautionary tactics, which according to this story means getting as many women pregnant as humanly possible. &lt;tic><br /><br />Kidding aside, the storyline, though a bit depressing has beautiful glints of sparkle (read: Hope) that gives some folks a reason for getting on with life and making that life as uplifting as possible.<br /><br />Sit back, make yourself comfortable and watch the film once in that position; then watch it again, but do it clinging to the edge of your seat.  If you get to watch it a third time, it may be too late to avert the world as shown to you.<br /><br />RUN!!!
0385504225|5.0|\\"This is Enlightenment!  It is his own brand.\\"    The words were written on a gift card in Solomon's handwriting.  Langdon didn't have to open the gift to figure out what was inside.  He knew his friend well enough to know the answer lied within the card itself.    Certainly there was deeper meaning?  Thirteen words in Enlightenment, he thought, thirteen rolls in a baker's dozen.  Years ago, bakers would add an extra roll as a safeguard against penalties if 12 weighed too light.  A group of 13...a safeguard.  But from what?!    Langdon's mind spun.  He glanced at his Mickey Mouse watch.  Time was running out.  What did this note mean?  What could Solomon have sent to him in this little package?  Certainly he could open it and have a look, and even a little shake wouldn't be beyond reason, but any clue to its contents would make for a too short a story, so he had to draw it out.    Think, dammit!  He racked his brain trying to break the code.  13...a group of 13...  And then the answer hit him.  Like so many times before, Robert Langdon had a stroke of genius!    Years before he had lectured about Vermeer's painting, The Milkmaid.  The baker's dozen portrayed in the painting was not what interested him, but it was the safeguard in the painting that caught his attention.  In the year the portrait was painted, kick tiles were installed around the walls as safeguards against rodents and other pests.  And in this painting in particular, Langdon recalled a number \\"5\\" clearly rendered on the tile behind the maid.    The five had caught his attention many times in the past.  Certainly it was an odd figure to paint on a kick tile, but how could Vermeer have know what Solomon would have sent to him so many years later?  Is it possible, he thought, that Vermeer had been Enlightened?    Enlightenment.  Number 5.  This is Enlightenment...this is number 5!    What could all of this mean?  And his own brand.  Certainly this was a code.    Langdon wiped his palms across the lapelsof his tweed jacket and tried to refocus his mind.  He was aflutter with the beautiful scientist he had met earlier that day, but he knew if he had any chance of ever seeing her alive again he had to figure this puzzle out.    Own brand.  Own brand.  O-W-N-B-R-A-N-D.  He unscrambled the letters and stared, in awe, as his handiwork.  Dan Brown!  The enlightment was Dan Brown.  Dan Brown's fifth novel!    Langdon recoiled, exhausted.  Solomon's gift was more than just a new book, it was a puzzle yearning to be solved.  Mission accomplished, the dashing professor thought to himself as he smiled, straightened the collar on his turtleneck and wound his Mickey watch.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|Dave Mustaine is back with another great thrash album full of venom and guitar solos. I've been a fan of Megadeth since I was a kid and remember those Marty Friedman days of back and forth guitar solos. While I always loved Chris Poland and Marty Friedman I have to say the addition of Chris Broderick (Nevermore, Jag Panzer)to the lineup really seems to have rejuvenated Dave into mixing up his own guitar soloing alot more. Dave always writes amazing riffs and blazing pentatonic solos, but Broderick has definitely challenged Dave in the speed and technicality departments as far as the solos go. With all respect to the previous guitarist Glen Drover, I haven't heard someone play alongside Dave like this since Marty Friedman in the Rust in Peace days. I've read that Broderick grew up playing along with Megadeth albums and I think he is a perfect fit for the band at this point in time. I saw the last Gigantour with Broderick in the lineup, and I gotta say the guy was amazing. But Mustaine was not to be outdone on this album as he shredded better than I have heard in 20 years. Totally solid album, albeit short. Buy it!

0385504225|4.0|Lost from these D.C.chases are Dan Brown's clever and amusing names of characters evidenced in his \\"The DaVinci Code.\\"  Miss that.  Thought it would be his signature, such as Nelson DeMille's clever, arrogant humor.  Instead, he creates a vengeful, fasting, steroided, tattooed, self-castrated, ex-drunken, rich playboy druggee, named Mal'akh. That bad, bad Solomon, 33rd degree Mason villain, would thinks he can become a god king by tattooing a circumpunct on his head and being killed by the left hand of his dad.     Is it Da Vinci's Vertruvian Man that comes to mind when Mal'akh assumes this position in front of a mirror and claims he is a masterpiece about to become another (castrated) god king or martyr like Osiris or the first Freemason, Hiram Abib?  Ahggh, his duped Masons should have stoned his circumpunct with all of his make up jars.    \\"How dark the con of man,\\" indeed.  No point in finding fault with this fiction or berating this author any further though.  I bought it and read the story, so I own it.  Who would mind writing something that a few million people would read?    Stay healthy folks.      jack mellone

B0000025ZF|5.0|On its own and in the context of Waters first solo album it is nothing short of brilliant.  I've always thought that Waters is probably the best writer of what he once called \\"inner space\\", the difficulty with being a human and dealing with other humans, and most importantly how people can fail to live up to their own expactations and those of others.  He was and is the best at describing what is going on inside the head.  Frankly, politically he's dull and preachy (which is why Amused to Death stinks).  I was 19 when this came out and didn't really get it.  Being 44 and listening again it is probably the best narrative of what its like to be middle aged, have doubts and fears about your relationship, then the stark realization of what is really important and how fragile it is.  With this he nailed what its like to be married and what goes on in your head.  The sad thing is musically its a dud, despite Clapton.  The reason I call this the greatest \\"could have been\\" is because this was origionally presented to Pink Floyd along with The Wall back in 1978.  They chose to do the Wall.  But, if we allow for the \\"What If\\" game can you imagine what all four could have done with this and what a follow up this would have been to The Wall?  Could have been their best album ever.
